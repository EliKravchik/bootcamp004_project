Wow  What a hell of a way to quit drinking  Rachel I m giving this a four stars  Not because the quality of the story deserves it  quite silly  childish and almost generic  More like a two stars   I m giving it a four star because it was hella fun to read  It was exciting  in that high school drama sort of way  What a bunch of pathetic losers they all were  None of this would have happened if there was one responsible  emotionally mature person in the group  However I loved this in the same way I loved Braodchurch  Grim  lost   memories of better times and twists  Who cares if it s like Gone Girl  I never read it and I don t care too  This one is British   Why I find even more hilarious is how the people who give this a one star write enormous reviews  about as long as the book  The way I see it  you re not fooling any one with long winded reviews  You read the damn book  and now you feel like you ve cheated your sense of pretentious intellect by doing so  So you have to write an entire essay explaining why you think it sucks  and why you re so smart  Well  you seem stupid caring much  How about a  fuck this book  this book sucks  and leave it at that   People have compared this book to Gone Girl    but I beg to differ I give this 4 stars  It was quite good   It had so many twist and turns that I was not able to guess who the killer was until it got to that point  It s hard to say that it was a good thing because well  it s good that I and probably a lot of people were not able to guess the ending but it had so many twists that I felt like it was purposely overloaded with all of that junk to mask the revelation at the end which sometimes I felt was unnecessary  I love how she gave the 3 readers three voices that really helped paint a picture of what was happening and kept us on the loop as to what the other relevant characters where thinking  what happened on their side  make us root and accuse one person based on what was currently happening in the story The only similar thing about this and gone girl is this  Someone goes missing  someone will get blamed and the missing someone is a victim   BUT not really It did kept me intrigued and helped me out of my 2 year reading slump  I felt bad for the characters it felt dark but exciting  it s the kind of book that makes me want to grab my kindle every chance I got just to know what happens next  Overall I thought she still did a great job  Definitely worth reading   I really enjoyed this novel   a true thriller that had me gripped throughout  I appreciated all of the characters  and  despite what other reviewers say  they were believable and relatable  The plot and the protagonist were original and the narrative voice of Rachel really kept me engaged and kept the pace going  I loved the plot twist at the end  although I found the final couple of pages a bit anti climactic  Any thriller fan will enjoy this   it hasn t got a ton of action but it is gripping and engaging   This is one of those books that I felt a little sad seeing end  I just know whatever comes on its heels will pale in comparison   I have no idea why I am bothering to leave a review for a book that already has more than 14 000 reviews on Amazon  surely enough folks have left their opinions by now so that mine is irrelevant  But still   First off  I wonder about the title  when the rider on the train left her girlhood behind her quite some time ago  and is now a thirtyish  pudgy  lank haired and utterly forgettable and serious alcoholic  Perhaps  The Drunk on the Train  or even  The Woman on the Train  does not have the same resonance  and certainly loses the subliminal tie in to  Gone Girl  that so many people have gone on and on about  So we have a girl on the train  Very well Many reviews track the plot very thoroughly  so go read those for the storyline  I m going to share my thoughts primarily about the characters  and then the story arc as a whole  For those of you in my august age group who remember Hitchcock s  Rear Window   and the much more youthful ones who saw  Disturbia   I think you ll agree that the characters in both movies who were such voyeurs and did some risky things were at least likeable  and we cheered for them to succeed against the bad guys  I did not like the characters in this book  none of them  female or male  I thought whatever they did to be supremely idiotic  and found myself hoping they would meet a Very Bad End   and soon  And yet  I kept reading  tapping those Kindle pages  one right after the other Rachel s appalling alcoholism  her weaknesses and bargain basement self esteem led to her riding the train in the first place to a job that no longer existed because of her drinking  She fantasized about a couple whose terrace she saw from her train window  and whose house was five doors down from the one she had shared with her ex husband  Her life was the pits  so this couple must have everything she did not  and that everything must be perfect  Almost everything Rachel thought  everything she did from this point on was a frustrating mix of cliches  of stereotyping  of improbability  and just plain nuts  I wanted to slap her about every ten pages or so  jerk some sense into her  and simply not care when she backed herself into a dangerous corner Megan the unhappy wife with a past  where have we met this character before  and how many times  She who was to be Rachel s perfect substitute was not  and her story  which we get in installments  had not the slightest hint of novelty in it  and therefore not much of interest  I didn t want to slap her for the predictable choices she made  but she did make me yawn quite a bit Anna was the worst of the three  self satisfied mistress to Rachel s husband  and now his wife  She reproduced and became a boring  insufferable Earth Mother who drinks lattes  does Pilates  and whines a great deal  I loathed her  and wanted something dreadful to happen to her  Quickly The less said about the two men  Tom  Rachel s former husband and Anna s present one  and Scott  Megan s husband and Rachel s Mr  Perfect  the better  Not only are they walking talking cliches but also the nearly fanatical focus of the three female protagonists  Even now  I fail to understand why  They were stupid  abusive  superficially charming  and as three dimensional as cardboard  They did not improve one iota from first to last  in my opinion So  in light of characters I thought were almost impossible to like  or for whom I couldn t muster the slightest empathy  why did I bother  Why should you bother  Because in spite of the faults  the reckless actions  the out of character behavior  Anna s incessant whining and Rachel s non stop drinking  and even the almost but not quite predictable denouement  I forgot all my irritations at the end   well  almost all  Somehow the book came together then  not particularly tidy  or necessarily conventional  but oddly in line with the generally messiness of the plot and its characters  At the end I cared about Rachel  and Anna  although I would still like to slap her  At the end I was glad I read the book  even as I cussed as I was reading it Someone  or several someones  actually  said this is a good beach book  and it is  A good book for a rainy evening with a glass or two of wine  or a long commute  especially on a train  Certainly not great literature  or a great example of the genre  but worth the read  I believe  Sometimes it s fun to talk back to characters  Her seye ragmen guzeldi  Sevdim gercekten   I gave it four stars because it was an original story and kept my attention  Like the main character  Rachel  I was an observer from the distance that got completely sucked into the lives of characters in this novel  Even though I wasn t enjoying the storyline and where it was taking me  I still had to keep reading to find out what happened  In my opinion  kudos to this debut author in creating a story that may not be an enjoyable read but still caused the reader to keep reading to get some resolution at the end   I don t want to go into too much details on the plot  because this is a story in which a lot hangs on the details  Rachel  train rider and observer of life  spends her days speculating and creating a world with the people she views from the window of her carriage on the day  When she watches an altercation involving two individuals she watches on a daily basis  her imaginary world is shaken  It is completely turned upside down when she discovers one of the individuals has disappeared  The book is really the voices of three characters as Hawkins chronicles the events of a disappearance  alcoholism  fall out from divorce  adultery  and pure psychological angst   It wasn t a favorite of mine  I think all the hype around it set the bar for my expectations  Overall  I would say give it a try so you can discuss with your friends who more than likely have also read it due to the hype   Read for a book club  One heck of a ride  Every single character is a hot mess  I seriously had no one idea who had done what to whom until the end  By the end I was very glad for my calm  boring life   Fantastically fun thriller   definitely check this one out when it s available  For someone who enjoys peeking into others  lives  this book is a treat  By the time I got to the end  I was as exhausted and hungover as the protagonist  The author writes with the immediacy of a journalist and the diary format works very well for her  Telling the story in multiple first person form  makes for a mosaic of engrossing word pictures leading to a fitting climax  By the time you get to the end  you may wonder if the ride was worthwhile  but then do you really care as long as it was enjoyable

muchisimo  me atrapo completamente  http   tribulationsdunevie weebly com   Le voyeurisme   Meme si elle ne l avouerait pas  c est l activite a laquelle s adonne chaque jour Rachel  depuis le train  lorsqu elle epie ceux qu elle a surnomme Jess et Jason dans leur maison  En plus de leur donner des prenoms  elle leur invente egalement une vie    Sauf qu un jour Jess  Megan en realite  disparait mysterieusement  Rachel  elle  a vu quelque chose     La fille du train  est un thriller de femmes  Ce sont elles qui ont la parole  elles qui menent l enquete  qui trahissent  qui mentent      La construction de ce roman revele une certaine complexite qui lui donne cet aspect addictif  3 femmes temoignent a tour de role nous apportant leurs differents points de vue sur l intrigue  Seulement  elles s expriment a des moments differents  Il est vraiment indispensable de se fier attentivement aux dates inscrites en debut de chapitre  Une fois ce point integre  la lecture devient un vraie moment de bonheur  impossible de poser le roman  L auteure a su apporter lentement un suspense qui a un impact puissant et efficace sur le lecteur  Les elements nous sont apportes au compte gouttes et nous suivons des personnages qui sont tout aussi perdu que nous  Les chemins empruntes par l intrigue nous conduisent dans des culs de sac  l auteure joue avec nous tout autant qu avec ses personnages  Un vrai lien intime  personnel  se cree avec les personnages au fil des chapitres  Un point d honneur est mis sur l expression de leurs sentiments les plus profonds  Rapidement on s attache a eux et on compati a la torture psychologique qu ils subissent   La fille du train  est aussi un roman emouvant  J ai passe un excellent moment de lecture avec ce thriller au suspense efficace  Un roman a la construction complexe qui apporte un tout autre interet a l intrigue   First of all  stop with the Gone Girl comparisons  A woman can write a thriller centered around flawed female characters without invoking that title  Personally  I hated Gone Girl  but I thought this was a fascinating thriller The first few chapters  admittedly  drag  Rachel  deep in the self indulgent misery of alcoholism  rides the same train to London day in and day out to mimic her old routine  She drinks in public and makes up stories about strangers  Then when one of her familiar subjects goes missing  I guess this is where the Gone Girl stuff comes from  but ignore that   the last stable bit of her life skids away from her  Bring in the new wife of Rachel s former husband  Anna  and the missing woman herself  Megan  and you have the complete cast of flawed  narrators in this twisted story   Unlike Flynn s writing  Hawkins  characters do have their redeeming qualities  even if you don t necessarily like them  Once Megan actually goes missing  the novel picks up its pace and deliver on that can t put it down promise  This is just tense enough and tight enough to hit the spot  even if I thought the choice of villain was a bit obvious  I m sure many people mentioned this already but this book reminded me of  Gone Girl   the movie version  since I haven t read the book  But the dark  suspenseful feeling you get throughout the storyline while reading the book  made me think of the same feelings I got while watching  Gone Girl   And the best parts are the twists in the story  We get three different viewpoints throughout the story  from three different women who are all linked together  Rachel is our main character  divorced  depressed  and drunk for more than half the time she appears in the book  Anne is the new wife of Rachel s ex husband  who moved into the same house that Rachel had been living with her ex  And Megan is the neighbor a few houses down  who has countless troubles of her own  We have three different viewpoints  but none of them are reliable  You get the feeling that they are all hiding something from you  not revealing the whole truth  or just don t know what s going on  like in Rachel s case since she s drunk for most of the story   And the best part throughout the book was guessing what really happened and piecing together the bits and pieces from each woman s viewpoint to reach the final conclusion   It seems that I read  Girl on the Train  recently and forgot to post a review of the novel  Therefore  my dim memories of this novel perhaps do not give it the due respect that it deserves  I do recall that I was tremendously empathetic of Rachel throughout the novel  as I found it profoundly sad that she had lost so much due to her personal problems arising from alcoholism  I really expected Rachel to be a less likeable character  but instead I felt so empathetic towards her and wanted life to work out well for her  I wanted her to overcome her drinking problem  pull herself together  and move on towards a brighter future  Although Rachel would be labeled as an unreliable character  I didn t find her devious and deceitful like Amy Dunne in Gone Girl  As to the ending  without giving too much away  let me just say that I thought it conveniently ironic that Rachel resolved the whole problem in the back yard with Tom  just as the train was going by  How clever of the author to construct the ending that way  Girl on the Train  was an entrancing novel that will have you riveted to the story from beginning to end  it was just suspenseful enough for me  without being too bizarre or explicitly gruesome  A railway line runs past houses and trains regularly stop or slow at a signal  From the front  the houses look impersonal  but from the train the backs look private and personal  The girl on the train  Rachel  is a regular commuter and always looks out  when it stops  to the house where she used to live and the neighbouring house where she often sees a couple in the garden Rachel s ex husband  Tom  lives in  her  house with his new wife  Anna  and child  She fantasises about the couple living nearby  seeing them as a perfect  happy couple and calls them Jason and Jess  One day she glimpses something that makes her doubt that view  One day she learns that Jess is Megan  and she has disappeared  later found murdered The story is about who murdered her  and is written with the voice of the three women  Rachel  Anna and Megan  Could Rachel be responsible  She is depressed and an alcoholic and has black holes in her memory when she is drunk  She frequents the street where she used to live  and has blood on her hands and a bad cut on her head  but can t remember anything  Megan used to baby sit for Anna  but left suddenly  Anna is fiercely protective of her child  and upset by Rachel s visits to the street Other candidates are Scott  Megan s husband  Supportive and loving  but not aware of Megan s past  and present secrets  Tom  Anna s husband  and Rachel s ex is charming and loving on the surface  but that hides a manipulative and deceitful nature  The other candidate is Megans therapist who might have a reason to wish her ill We are left wondering throughout the book   who is the killer  We need to read without stopping to see how it ends I like the way the characters are portrayed  Rachel feels detached from life because of her depression  and unsure whether memories are real or imagined because of her drinking  Megan has a hole in the middle of her soul because of events in the past  It makes her feel restless and unsettled  Anna hates living in the house that was occupied by Rachel  and desperately wants to be happy with Tom and the baby Babies thread themselves through the book  One much loved and protected  one much loved but accidently killed  one killed before birth  one not conceived   all affecting the story  Death is another theme   death of a father  of a brother  of a daughter  in the past  but all affecting the story  and Megan s death in the present A very readable book  full of character and suspense  Will have you hooked from the start  Glad I got to know what the noise was all about  Id say it s a must read  Suspense  Thriller  Great job for a debut   Opiniao completa em  http   historiasdeelphaba blogspot pt   E realmente facil perceber o sucesso desta historia  o seu ritmo que embala e abraca o leitor nesta viagem complexa pela mente humana  a tres vozes  com tres destinos paralelos que nao se veem  desfocados nos seus percursos diferentes que nos prendem a narrativa de A Rapariga no Comboio Paula Hawkins deu largas a sua imaginacao e fez me mergulhar profundamente na sua ficcao  com o desejo de saber ate onde levaria a sua rapariga presa aos carris de um transporte comum  presa entre o seu passado e presente  presa entre estacoes  enquanto tece palavras e pensamentos ilusorios  mas fortes  que tornam esta obra viciante na busca pela coerencia e juncao de factos deste thriller psicologico que  tambem em terras lusas  promete conquistar leitores  A sua escrita  algumas vezes complexa e outras tantas vezes tao natural  e quase encantatoria  com o nivel certo de suspense e misterio que nos impulsiona sempre para o proximo capitulo Rachel  Megan e Anna  sao tres mulheres diferentes e com universos singulares que  passo a passo  em momentos temporais proximos  nos contam os seus segredos mais intimos e expoem as suas emocoes mais cruas  Sao tres rastilhos dissonantes que se vao envolvendo e enlacando rumo a um desfecho quase obvio mas cego na sua resolucao  um desfecho construido de sentimentos  conviccoes  atitudes e accoes contraditorias que estao longe de revelar tudo o que o leitor anseia por descobrir  Every year I try to read a book written from the present year  the year is almost over and I realized I had yet to read a book from 2015 so this year s honor went to The Girl on the Train and what a good choice that was We are introduced to Rachel every day she takes the morning train to London and on her way she spots a couple outside their house   Jason   Jess   through her commute she creates a fantasy story of them  of the happily married perfect couple  Through them she projects her own failures and insecurities and turns it into the opposite of her own life in order to avoid seeing the house that used to belong to her a couple of houses away  One day she looks into the house and sees  Jess  with another man and that devastates her  the perfect couple she made up in her mind was not what she thought  and to complicate matters worse the next day she learns Jess Megan has disappeared and a mystery begins to unravel  The book gives a really hard look into alcoholism and abuse  we see Rachel battling with it and how she became the person she is in that moment  She gives us a glimpse of her past life  how her marriage ended and how her life went down the drain  Through the mystery of Megan s disappearance she finds a new purpose trying to help find her and who is guilty of it  We also get the story one year before from Megan as she tries to keep her secrets and we get clues of who the culprit of her disappearance is  The reveal is obvious  but the way the book gets us there is well crafted Paula Hawkins deserves all the praise she is receiving by writing one of the best books of the year   For fans of Gone Girl   I was incredibly skeptical on this one  but ended up really enjoying it  Everyone is going to call it the Gone Girl of 2015 and it s hard not to compare the two books even though the plots are completely different  It s fast paced and cringeworthy at times  in a good way   I would recommend for anyone who enjoys a good who done it  Dysfunctional and flawed characters  Good story that kept my interest  I enjoyed it and look forward to more of this author s books  A solid 3 5 Honestly speaking  this book isn t supposed to be on my priority reading list  Well  I do want to read it at some point but the hype and all the glowing reviews I read have made me change my mind  To avoid spoilers  my thoughts on this book would be vague and the characterisations is about all I could say  The story is told in three perspectives  Rachel  Megan and Anna  Three different women who aren t really happy with their life  Rachel is a divorcee but couldn t seem to get her ex husband  Tom  out of her mind  She is also an alcoholic  Megan is a married woman who seems blissful in her marriage but she has a secret no one knows  She s also living in an area where Rachel used to live before the divorce  and there s a railway track nearby  Anna is the current wife of Tom  The three women s lives become inexorably intertwined after Rachel found an interesting couple during her regular train rides that would later change all their lives altogether  After reading The Girl on the Train  I can understand why it is a top seller  It is suspenseful and there is something about unreliable narrators that makes you wonder about their voices and behaviours and whether or not should you believe them  And in most cases they aren t likeable characters  either  Still  I enjoy reading books with such narrators because they are unpredictable and it is always fun to see if my guess is correct in the end  I know there are mixed reviews on this book  and while I felt it compelling it didn t  wow  me the way I had wanted it to be  Still  it was a page turner and I enjoyed reading it  I wasn t surprised that this book has been optioned for film by DreamWorks and I am curious to see how it would turn out with the film adaptation  I would definitely be on a look out for Ms  Hawkins  next release   It s a page turner  Especially in the last 30 pages  However  in my opinion  it s no Gone Girl  Similar  yes  but the twists are more predictable  I found the the characters in Gone Girl much more interesting  At the beginning it sort of reminded me Rear Window  the way someone with a disability witnesses a crime while casually watching their neighbors  Rachel  the main character detective  is in fact disabled by her depression and addiction at the beginning  Solving the crime and bringing clarity to the relationship with her husband  end up being a parallel denouement  This main narrator in this book is drinking all the time  In fact a lot of the characters are tossing around some kind of booze  much of the time  There is also a lot of serial adultery   let this book be a warning to you  haha  The men roughing up their spouses and running the show is sort of cliche  It s a wonder they can even function  Obviously by the end we re seeing the pile up of all this disfunction  I guess I liked Gone Girl a lot because she was so smart and conniving  In this book the key women are all victims of some kind of abuse  From start to finish it does stay true to the premise that  Things are not always what they appear to be   Oh  and there s a final  tiny little twist that you may or may not expect   but may miss if you re nodding off  This was a book club pick and I must say it was pretty good  I liked the mysterious build up to the ending  even though I thought the ending could have been better  The character development was great and I liked all of them  It was well organized and I told from different view points  which made it more interesting   I think that it is interesting that this book is being compared to Gone Girl  I liked it much better than Flynn s novel and didn t find the styles that similar  What they have in common is that they are both thrillers with a twist    in this book s case  several twists  The characters are deliciously flawed and each seems either unreliable or guilty  4 5 stars Although I had a terrible time liking any of the characters  I still found this a great mystery  Read fast because I couldn t wait to see how it ended  This book was a very interesting read and very well written  I was amazed that by the time I got to about page 140 nothing had really happened   you didn t have much information at all but I was still compelled to keep reading  The book is narrated by three different women and switches between them which keeps things interesting  This book keeps being compared with Gone Girl but it s really nothing like it   a completely unique story  Also  Paula s description of commuting via train really makes me wish I had that option  Primeiras impressoes  nao e assim tao extraordinario como todas as criticas faziam prever  Le se bem  mas estava a espera de mais emocao e enredo  Muito empenho na construcao psicologica das personagens  mas preferia mais suspense no desenrolar da historia  Ainda assim  vale a pena para quem gosta do genero  Scorrevole  avvincente nonostante la trama non troppo originale  Una lettura estiva azzeccata  I READ A POPULAR BOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME BASICALLY EVER  ONE THAT PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE HEARD OF AND THAT MAYBE I CAN TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT IN THE REAL WORLD WITH MY SPEAKING VOICE  The ending could have been twenty pages shorter but it s certainly a good book to read when you ve given up drinking for Lent  Great read  Kept me in suspense  I figured out who did it a little over halfway through  but I still enjoyed this clever  mind bending thriller full of unreliable narrators  red herrings  and beautifully written yet chilling prose  It makes you wonder how much you don t know about people   even those closest to you  Great read for when you re in the mood for a good old fashioned murder mystery  I feel like The Girl on the Train deserves more than 3 5 stars  yet 4 stars would be much more than it deserves  so maybe 3 7  perhaps  It wasn t perfect  but good enough to keep me going     I m playing at real life instead of actually living it    I have to clear something first  I hate it  hate it  when advertisers label books as  the next blank  or  this is hotter than blank  or  this is just like blank  but much better  and The Girl on the Train was one of those cases  Worse  this book got all hyped up because of that  which is  I presume  what essentially the advertisers wanted  People went into this book with high expectation because hello  Have you read Gone Girl  It s a mind fuck and awesome  but were left with nothing but disappointment because this is not quite like Gone Girl  not in the way you might think  It s so sad for The Girl on the Train because I think people might have liked it more if it weren t compared to Gone Girl This is why I don t like this marketing strategy  because I think it s unfair  it s not fair for the new book  it s not fair for the book that s being compared to  When everyone  literally everyone  claimed it as  the next Gone Girl  I got the same feeling I had when I heard people calling George R R  Martin  The American Tolkien  It bothers me because why can t George just be George R  R  Martin  the first and the last  I love Gone Girl  and its originality and the I ve never ever read anything like this before feeling that I got when I read it So let s not compare these books together just because this book involved unreliable characters and a missing girl  I will say  If you loved Gone Girl  you might also enjoy The Girl on the Train  That doesn t mean it s as mind fucking as Gone Girl  it doesn t mean it has this big fucking reveal that will make you want to scrub your brain  no no  it s a different plot line  it s simply dark and edgy which is what a thriller should be  thrillers like Gone Girl and other books  Now  the book itself  Like I said  it wasn t perfect but damn I had so much fun with it  It had just the right amount of thriller tension to keep me fixated on reading rather than listening to the pounding of the workmen in our kitchen  It was suspenseful  addictive  and one of those stories where you cannot trust anyone  The ending didn t appeal to some people but I personally liked it  it was well thought out The writing I wouldn t say was anywhere near special  it didn t stand out for me  hence the 3 7 stars  the pace was a bit slow at the beginning  yet not boring but later on I was completely hooked    There s nothing so painful  so corrosive  as suspicion    I ll definitely pick up Hawkins s future books  I think they ll be a huge step from her debut  Recommended to anyone who likes mystery thrillers  Me debato entre un 3 75 y un 4    Ya han pasado un par de dias desde que termine el libro y aun no me aclaro muy bien sobre si me gusto mucho o un poco menos que eso o que  jajaja  Vamos a ver  La Chica del Tren sigue las historias de varias personas  pero sobre todo de Rachel  una mujer cuya vida se ha ido desbaratando en los ultimos anos  Paso de estar felizmente casada a divorciarse  tener problemas con la bebida  con las personas y con su trabajo  Rachel vive con su casera y  para que ella no se entere de que ha perdido el trabajo  sigue tomando el tren de las 8 04 para ir a Londres y el de la tarde para volver a Ashbury todos los dias  En sus trayectos de tren  Rachel siempre ve una calle llena de casas en donde solia vivir con su marido Tom  antes de que el la cambiara por Anna y su hija pequena  Ademas de eso  en una de las casas vive una pareja que  a ojos de Rachel  es perfecta  Incluso les ha puesto nombres a pesar de que no los conoce  ella los llama Jess y Jason  El punto de todo esto es que  un dia  Rachel ve algo extrano en la casa de Jess y Jason y  al siguiente  Jess  cuyo nombre real es Megan  es reportada como una persona desaparecida  El punto de todo esto es que Rachel siente que debe ser parte de la investigacion porque sabe que estuvo por ahi el dia de la desaparicion  aunque lo malo es que no recuerda nada porque su problema con el alcohol es tan serio que incluso tiene lagunas mentales  La Chica del Tren  entonces  empieza a jugar con una narracion no lineal y a tres voces  hay capitulos narrados por Rachel  otros por Anna y algunos por Megan  A lo largo del libro vemos como son las vidas de estas tres mujeres  de sus esposos  de sus hijos    y los conocemos como se supone que son realmente  La cosa aqui es que la autora juega con las perspectivas y con la informacion que nos va dando de tal manera que nos hace pensar que  conocemos  a los personajes cuando realmente no es asi  Siempre hay un halo de misterio y de incertidumbre que rodea todo lo que nos esta contando Rachel o lo que cree recordar de sus lagunas mentales  Asi pues  cuando vamos llegando al final del libro y vemos como el misterio de la desaparicion de Megan se va aclarando  nos damos cuenta de que estuvimos completamente enganados durante mas de 300 paginas  Que lo que parece ser no es siempre lo que realmente es    y creo que ese es uno de los puntos fuertes de este libro  De nuevo  cuando lees el final  entiendes un monton de datos o de circunstancias descritas que en un principio parecian super gratuitas  pero que  claramente  no lo eran  Pero bueno   por que digo que no se si ponerle 3 75 o 4 estrellas o que  Sigo sin tenerlo muy claro  pero creo que el ritmo del libro es un poco lento  yo no encontre el ansia de seguir leyendo compulsivamente cada pagina como muchas personas me decia que me iba a pasar  Quiza otra de las razones por las que no disfrute tanto de la historia es que el hype  la reputacion  por decirlo de alguna manera  de este libro estaba por las nubes  Lo pintaban TAAAAN bien  que esperaba algo extraordinario  pero yo no lo encontre  En fin  eso pasa cuando lees un libro con las expectativas tan altas  supongo  jajaja  Sin embargo  si que lo recomiendo para los amantes del misterio y de los thrillers ambientados en Inglaterra  I have lost control over everything  even the places in my head A  Trust No One  and  Hate Everyone  kind of  Whoddunit   The formula of a modern psychological thriller   ie Gone Girl   is on point   We have a missing woman  we have adulatory  we have alcoholism  and we have trains  Something about those trains made the story more eerie and Hitchcock like  I had extremely high expectations for this and maybe that s why it fell just a tiny bit flat for me  Over all a true page turner We meet Rachel   Who once had everything  the husband  the house  the life    and now she has nothing but her alcohol and the stories she makes up as she watches  happy  people as she rides the trains to a place she no longer works every morning  Then we meet Megan  one of those  happy  people Rachel sees on her daily route  with her beautiful house and her handsome husband  Last but not least we meet Anna  who lives in Rachel s former  perfect  life  But nothing is ever as it seems from the inside of a train window  The chapters alternate narrators between these characters  which may sometimes get confusing  but in this case was written quite well   i loved the pacing of this book  Like others have said  the use of the unreliable narrator added to the suspense of the novel  You are trying to piece together a story through the eyes of a drunk  a liar and the blissfully ignorant  The fourth and most reliable narrator is of course the train  which the author weaves into the story quite nicely  Though the ending was predictable  I could not put this book down  I am not sure I would call this the next Gone Girl  both stories are great in their own rights  I would definitely recommend this book to those that love thrillers   One word    twisted     I liked it AND it kept me guessing   I would really rate this book 3 5 stars but decided to round up  What can I say  I like the unlikeable characters  I ve read other reviews where this seemed to be a complaint  and I understand  I do  If I don t like a main character sometimes I just can t do it  And even though the redeeming qualities in these characters are slim  I think I enjoyed them because it was a way for Hawkins to expound on the theme that everybody lies  especially to themselves  And sometimes those little lies you tell yourself every day turn into one big one that you eventually have to face I also loved the idea of the train  The constant movement  watching people and houses as they pass  watching other passengers  feeling the shuffle of the carriages  the smells  even the gross ones    those were all captured excellently and I think Hawkins used the train as a symbol to her advantage  The only thing I was a little disappointed in was that I guessed the whodunit fairly early on  Not like twenty pages early  but still kind of early  This would be the one point I would rate the book down on  except I wonder if Hawkins didn t write this way intentionally  Having an idea of the culprit lets you look for clues and inconsistencies  I much prefer that than some out of the blue character no reader with two brain cells to rub together would ever suspect So  I gave the author the benefit of the doubt and rated up  It s a great read  I finished it in a weekend because I couldn t put it down  I struggled with what to rate this book   I was leaning more towards 3 3 5 stars because I didn t find really any redeemable qualities of any of the characters  and specifically  the whole alcoholic excuse was a bit too repetitive and annoying in my opinion  What pushed my rating up to 4 stars is that the story admittedly did hold my attention curiosity  more than the 8 YA novels I ve started and not finished in the past few months  enough that I looked forward to figuring out the mystery  and after I found out the  who done it   I realized a very important detail about the chapters from Megan s perspective that I won t mention for spoiler alert purposes   If it wasn t for the end this would be a 3 star  It was kind of monotonous during the read  Not completely bad but good enough to keep you intrigued and needing to know what s going on  Basically Rachel is an alcoholic who s husband left her for his mistress  Anna who in the middle of the read I hated and was a complete cry baby bitch  so Rachel moved in with her friend Cathy  She rides the train everyday looking at the house she used to live in with her husband  and a couple houses before she sees  who she calls  Jess and Jason  Her imagination is vivid and she s usually always drunk so she makes up little stories about them and how they have a perfect life and super inlove all from her daily observations from the train  But then someone in the town disappears and Rachel s mind spirals into confusion cause she doesn t remember what happened because being blackout drunk is a bitch and she s trying to remember the night that the person turns up missing and why she    I m gonna just stop and not spill all the beans   Sounds kinda plain  But then there s the ending  And you re like  whaaaaa    And about halfway through it ll start picking up  you ll find yourself trying to figure it out and notice you ve started reading faster and fasterI ve read a lot of reviews comparing this to gone girl  I can see how that is true  Although me being a massive Gillian Flynn fan  this is a runner up solely because I can t get myself to think someone being better than her in this genera  Which   this book isn t better than hers  But nonetheless it was pretty good Writing style was great  Clear and comprehendible  Character build got slightly confusing at times but if you just kept going it all unfolded itself leaving you to say  ohhhhh  lolDo I recommend  Yes  If you like gone girl then I do  Keeping in mind it s probably not gonna be better than gone girl to you  but it s still a good read  But if you re easily squeamish then no  Don t read it   I enjoyed that this book was easy to read and fast paced  And I did like the twist at the end  Good suspense novel 4 5 Super fun  Yes  you can compare it to Gone Girl  But not really  This was an easy read and pretty difficult to put down  I really enjoyed it and can recommend as a read that definitely makes you think about things Initially I found Rachel very annoying   she was weak and shameful in her behaviour  But the more I read  the more her behaviour made sense and I ended up understanding how she got to her low point  She really had a lot of help getting there  There were some interesting characters in the book   and although I suspected who did it half way through  it was unpredictable enough to really make me think    you never really know the people around you  what they are going through  what s in their history to make them who they are  We all make judgements every single day   just from fleeting moments   and sometimes we should all sit back and give people around us a chance  You don t know why people act they way they do   what had made them get to a certain point in their life  Made me think  I had my moments where I thought it was too bizarre of a book but I did like the ending  Overall it was still a good read  Awesome suspense building  plot and writing style  Characters I wish were UNDER the train    Best mystery I ve read in a while  A few grammatical hiccups that annoyed me  but enjoyed the ride  pardon the pun  and didn t want to put it down   Gone Girl like  but better  Problem was  I didn t like any of the characters  wasn t rooting for anyone so the twist and turns  although nicely done  left me a bit cold The motives were a bit unclear here and there as well However  I read the 80  of the book in the last 24 hours which doesn t happen every day  Although the Bechdel test http   en wikipedia org wiki Bechdel_    is used for movies  it is instructive to apply it to books  Here we have three female narrators and every scene is about men The work is so original that it surpasses the genre limitations of romantic suspense  and it certainly doesn t have a neat  expected ending  And  it deals with big issues in women s lives relationships and children so it is profound and affecting The writing and plotting are superb  The scenes about trying to recover memories from blackouts are suspenseful Nonetheless  it would have been more gratifying to read about three women who weren t unemployed and who had something bigger going on in their lives  I enjoyed and recommend The Girl on the Train  It is a light but rewarding read  The characters especially the lead women  are real and human  foibles and all  and Paula Hawkins tells a compelling tale Rachel Watson  as the main character  was well drawn out  as the still fresh ex wife of a man that had married a woman who whom he had had an affair  The story takes place primarily on Blenheim street which backs onto a railway line  Rachel  jobless  nonetheless takes a train to London under the pretext of going to her job but her primary goal is to stay connected to the lives of her ex  Tom  and his new wife whose house   her former home   she can get a good view of as the train regularly slows down in that area because of issues with the railway track  Rachel is an alcoholic  and suffers the mental anguish of the addiction and the increasing isolation she experiences as her life appears to completely unravel  exacerbated by not only her obsessive preoccupation with her ex and his new life   wife  by their baby   Rachel was barren   and by a fantasy she has developed of the perfect couple whom she calls Jason an Jess who live close to Tom and his wife  I had trouble putting the book down  I took an immediate liking to Rachel  and as the story line alternated between Rachel  Anna  Tom s wife  and Megan   Rachel s Jess  with Rachel getting top billing  it became fascinating to get the different viewpoints on Rachel s behaviour  What was also fascinating was whether Rachel was real or not  and this is just my perspective and I mention it from the perspective that psychologically she was a mess and mentally her brain was cooked from her alcoholism  So when she spoke or saw something  could the reader assume that this was what was really happening  But what Hawkins achieved I think was a story in which I could give Rachel the benefit of the doubt and keep believing in her  It was a strange sensation  on one hand  everyone around her doubted her sanity based on what they could visibly see of her behaviour  but the reader   knowing much more about why she could be completely insane   seemed willing not to lose faith in her  There were moments where it was easy to conclude that she was the killer  that the drinking had not made her neurotic  it just camouflaged her psychosis  But Hawkins made it so that we were willing to wait and see how things turned out  The men in the story fared not so well but it seemed ok  after reading Simone du Beauvoir s The Second Sex when I was 20 I became and remained kind of comfortable and respectful around women  so it was neat to become for a while engrossed in this woman centric story   Edwin  This was lauded as a thriller but I would categorize the novel more as a mystery simply because I never got goosebumps reading about the characters nor the story itself  The concept of three different first person narratives each with their own POV  was spot on  as it allows for more of an in depth look at the story arch and its subsequent climax   Near the end  I was however  able to easily predict who the antagonist was ahead of the  big reveal   I completely enjoyed this debut novel by Paula Hawkins  Looking forward to her sophomore effort   I ve noticed there are some comments saying that the storytelling is flat and a little bit boring in the first 280pages or so before Rachel realised who s behind all the horiffic things  well  that I really cannot agree with   Unlike many other thrillers if you think about it  there s only one main suspense surrounding the whole story in this book  that is  the missing memories of Rachel about the night when Jess went missing  The narration from perspectives of different and often unreliable  narrators all added to the building up of the sense of suspense and thrill  which  I gather  made such a thriller with not so complicated storylines actually gripping to read Another thing worth noticing is that the whole book was written in a diary like way  It s not an easy thing to create some alcoholic and mentally unstable or disloyal characters who s lives are total messes yet can still let the readers pity for them and feel for them  When Paula Hawkins has chosen to tell this story in the first person  she s enabled us readers to empathize with the characters of her novel  When reading the story  we see what Rachal saw when she s sad and wasted on her own  we feel what Jess felt when her baby died because of her Yes  there s no denying that the lack of plot twist is the main reason why many people don t like The Girl on the Train  Yet  should the same story be handed to someone else to finish  it might ended up being really boring  Maybe Paula Hawkins s polished writting skills and well crafted storytelling have something to do with her experiences as a journaliste  Stories are always there  sometimes fascinating sometimes not  it s the way you tell them that matters  Ce train qui separe Rachel de ce couple apporte a ce thriller un contexte original et cette femme depressive et alcoolique en devient malgre tout attachante  J ai ete intriguee par ce thriller jusqu a la fin mais un peu decue des revelations et sans aucun doute genee par l ambiance pesante  le brouillard perpetuel et la confusion qui regne dans l esprit de Rachel  Un livre particulier et original Ma chronique   https   myprettybooks wordpress com 2    I ve never had a book where I absolutely hated every character  every single one   but still liked the book  Took me a quarter of the way through before I was hooked but after that I finished it in one day   Ha anos que nao me acontecia comecar e acabar um livro no mesmo dia As expectativas eram muitas ate comecar a ler algumas opinioes menos boas por isso comecei o livro sem esperar muito dele Foi uma surpresa    nao e uma obra prima da literatura  no entanto nao o consegui largar o dia todo  Agarrou me de tal forma que so queria saber o fim  Nao m surpreendeu mto o culpado pois comecei a desconfiar cedo  mas gosteiGostei mesmo muito e aconselho  E nao achei nada parecido com o parte incerta   desse nem gostei por ai alem este esta muito melhor conseguido na minha opiniao   I had a love hate relationship with this book  It was fascinating and kept me compulsively reading it but the content is preeeettttty heavy and I mostly read in bed at night before going to sleep   I often thought   Why am I reading this  I m going to have horrible nightmares after this   But like any good mystery  I had to know  whodunnit    and I ll admit  the ending surprised me  I think I must have suspected everybody in the book at some point  so I d say that s a sign that the author did a good job  I have read this in three days  Three days of suspense  excitement and questions I really loved the book and the way we get to know more and more on each character at each chapter  Somehow it reminded me of Gone Girl And like gone girl I was disappointed by the end  I knew it was Tom at half of the book  But still it was entertaining to read and I was really curious about the story   Even though I felt the story line was frustrating and disturbing  I couldn t put this book down until the end  I tend to always fall for a good suspense story      Having read 50 pages  I said  it was overhyped   halfway through  I started collecting loopholes while predicting  plot twist   with 1 4 left I became really appreciate the narrative style and plot structure  It s not only riveting  but also created a heroine   one of the most unusual and enduring  as well as other credible characters   well fit puzzle pieces   3 5 stars  Not at all what I was expecting  I kept wondering what was going on in the first half of this book and it took a while to get into  The second half flew by and literally read finished it in a day  The characters are pretty awful  the situation even more awful and yet I had to find out what happened to these people   Rating  4 stars2015 Reading Challenge  A book that takes place in another country  not my own  not USA I am pleasantly surprised with The Girl on the Train  The book came with a lot of hype behind it  being compared with a favorite of mine  Gone Girl  but after reading a couple of bad reviews I was not sure I was going to enjoy it  but actually I did  and a lot The first thing I liked about this book was that I had no sympathy for any character in this book  at first I had it for one character and it turns out that she he was the one that deserved my complete hatred  which leads me to the second think I enjoyed  the author fooled me in almost everything  I guessed one thing but the way things developed after that was completely unexpected  I was biting my nails the whole time  trying to guess what had happened  The main narrator was unreliable  the POVS from the three women had details that confused me  The attitude from the side characters were misleading  everything added to the whole mystery and I loved it  The book pulled out of me very strong emotions  I wanted to hit characters  especially Rachel  because I just wanted her to rise from all the things that were happening to her and from the way people were treating her The Girl on the Train deals with many controversial topics like cheating  abortion  the desire to become a mother and not having the chance to do so  alcoholism  domestic violence  It was very depressing since page one  but sometimes I just need to read something like that and this one was perfect  Totally recommended if someone likes Gillian Flynn  she is a better writer than Paula Hawkins  but the latter gives Gillian a run for her money I was totally satisfied about the way the book ended  a very very good thriller that kept me guessing the whole time  PS  Honestly after reading books like Gone Girl  The husband s secret and this one I don t get why people want to get married  I know the scenarios presented here are extreme but still     Wow  A thrilling read to the very end  I can t rate it 5 stars because I didn t love the language and scandalous scenes  but I honestly couldn t put it down  Won t sleep very well tonight    Very intriguing and suspenseful  Definitely a page turner  Read it in a day  Terrible people written so well  I called it early on  But I enjoyed the ride  Can t wait for the movie  Someone call Keira Knightly   Full review on my blog  http   padfootslibrary blogspot ca 20    Even though I enjoyed reading this book  I have to give it 3 5 stars  This was an easy  quick read  It held your interest and was a page turner  but the ending was a bit of a letdown  I liked the way it was written in multiple voices over different time periods  Characters were not very likeable  Premise was interesting  but the final reveal was not that surprising  The hype lead me to believe it would be the same caliber as Gone Girl  Silly me for believing the hype  It was overall a decent read  it just wasn t as suspenseful as I was hoping  For all the hype this book is getting I was ever so slightly underwhelmed  Don t get me wrong  I liked it  But I had pretty much worked it out and guessed the rest half way through the book  By the end the entire reasoning behind what happened seemed petty  BUT the creeps were immense and some of the revelations  especially from the three women  were shiver worthy Reviewing books like this is hard because everything is a hint at something that happens in the book but I shall try and I will do it spoiler free  Yay  3 75  This book seems to have gotten a lot of hype prior to its release  I was excited to be a lucky early reviewer   even more excited when I saw the really cool outer covering that the book came in    a  window  peeking into the book  representing the window on the train  Another example of a book sucking me in with its cover art This is billed as a psychological thriller  and it is  although not necessarily an edge of your seat one  Rachel is a young woman living on the outskirts of London  She commutes daily into the city  and one day she witnesses something through the train window that inevitably involves her in a crime investigation  This wasn t really a fast paced novel  although I did get sucked in and read it rather quickly  Rachel is divorced  but still in love with her ex husband  who has remarried  She s depressed  She drinks    a lot  She continually makes bad or questionable decisions  I wavered between feeling sorry for her and being fed up with her  But yet I kept reading  and tried to figure out how the book was going to end before I got there  It s a good  although not quite excellent  read  Near the end  things started moving quickly  and then ultimately were tidied up a little too neatly in my opinion  But still a good read    I was reading almost right up until midnight on New Year s Eve in order to finish this one  and it s one that will appeal to many readers in the new year   Everyone raved about this book  For the first third or so  I wondered why   it was good and everything but I didn t understand the excitement  Then I got it  Hawkins does an AMAZING job of keeping the reader on their toes  You never know which direction to look and that s amazing  I feel like the writing style was perfect in keeping the suspense and keeping you guessing  The jumping forward to look back added to the mystery  It was great  I d recommend it to just about anyone  It delivered what it promised  This book was definitely a page turner  and a welcome distraction from the flight from hell  If you re looking for an engrossing book that will keep you guessing about what will happen next  look no farther  I do not know who handles Ms  Hawkins  marketing and promotion but am interested to learn if they accept first born children in exchange for their diabolical pact services  One word I would use to describe the book  The Girl on the Train  by Paula Hawkins would be  truth   This book is a mystery  through different points in time and different perspectives  All of them slowly unravel the layers of the mystery  until you figure out the actual truth The book begins in the perspective of a woman named Rachel who lives in England  You find that she is in a low point in her life  Divorced  living temporarily in the home of her friend  and having a drinking problem  However  on her train ride to her work  she fantasizes about a particular house of a married couple  Although she knows nothing about the actual couple  she imagines their whole life  including their names  The book then switches perspective to a younger woman named Megan  except it is two months earlier  She herself is at an awkward point in her life  The book follows the two women in their respective time lines  until suddenly  someone goes missing  The story continues following different perspectives until the end when the two timelines collide  and the truth is revealed I struggled to connect with any of the characters  There were few of them in the story  and of those that were  there was no connection between them and me  Most all of the characters had adult problems  such as alcoholism  infidelity  and financial difficulties  all of which are difficult to connect with I give the book a big thumbs up because it was a huge page turner  The information is revealed at a pace such that you are swept into any moment  and then suddenly the perspective and time change  It leaves you with no option but to silently scream in anger and keep reading  as I did multiple times   As a mystery  it is not to hard to follow  nor to easy to solve  The different views of the characters leads you into one lead or thought  and then a sudden change in the story shows you that everything is wrong  and you are led to start all over again  It is quite an aggravating but rewarding process  Those who love mysteries might enjoy this  especially if you like things beyond your typical Sherlock Holmes  Also someone who enjoys fiction of everyday life with a twist would quickly fall in love with this  Zhadnata mi za tril r dusha e dovolna  Oshche s p rvite dve stranitsi se podkhl

but was pleasantly surprised  I had made several theories about who was the murderer but none was right  The characters are all messed up yes  but who cares  It s not all about character development  it s about the story  And this one was great  Nao correspondeu as expetativas que eu tinha  Ate o achei um pouco previsivel  Mas nao o consegui largar enquanto nao o acabei  Dai as 4 estrelas pequeninas  A todos aqueles que acham este livro muito bom recomendo um policial nordico   4 starsWhat an amazing book  I was on the edge of my seat the entire 300  pages  I loved every story of these characters in equal measure Rachel is the girl on the train that goes thru the same route and sees the same house everyday and is so used to the loving couple called Jess and James in her mind  Perfect and loving Except Rachel isn t happy  She s broken up from her husband who left her for another women  She s a drunk and her life is in shambles  One day she sees something that shatters her dream that Jess is the perfect women and later she gets hurt and doesn t remember anything from that night  What ensues is a thrilling tale and you have no idea what s going to happen next Paula has written the book so well  Very twisted and crazy  Kind of a Gone Girl story but extraordinary in its own way  Paula spins the tale between 5 to 6 characters quite well  When you think that it s going to be boring only with 6 characters its not  You have no idea what s going to happen  What are these people going to do to each other  I felt the tale was twisted and sick sometimes  Not the pace but the fact that people are so twisted in this world and its a new kind of thrill to read it when it s written so well  A well hyped read that I felt was worth it hype The one character I really liked was none other then Kamal Abdic  The way he was described and the way he s under control and takes his sessions  Great writing  An awesome read  Just don t read it when your sad  Very entertaining   Engaging thriller with a main character who is definitely a train wreck but I still somehow did not hate her and actually felt sorry for her  I would definitely read this author again  We can easily appreciate the mixed reaction to  Train  and the inevitable comparisons to  Gone Girl   which we had previously read   We also expect it may resonate better with most women than most men  as we spend much of the novel inside the heads of three different women  in sort of an existential discussion of relationship issues and everyday angst The premise was pretty catchy   a woman who commutes daily on an hour long train ride  between home and London  gets to  know  some of the residents she can see from the train  when it routinely stops mid route for traffic issues  She is particularly enchanted with a couple named Jason and Jess  and fantasizes all sorts of goings on about them  Soon enough we get to meet the couple in real life as the plot begins to unfold  and then we get alternating chapters of progress from Rachel  the train girl   Anna  Rachel s ex husband s new wife  and  Jess   the other woman  The interrelationships between these characters and their men  with occasional asides from Rachel s roommate  eventually lead to a mysterious disappearance  shades of  Gone Girl   A suspenseful latter half reveals all  with what seemed to us a poignant ending We liked the very clever way that the author slowly uncovered what was really going on  it took a little while  but had us turning pages rapidly  While many readers will not necessarily find the three women that endearing  all the crossed interactions between them were intriguing to say the least  In the end  we were quite pleased and highly entertained  I had to convince myself to read this book  I still wouldn t have read it if not for my mum who got it for me  I thought it s probably overrated  not a good read and disappointing as it will not be as good as Gone Girl  Well  I was pleasantly surprised  Very good read  so much so  it took me two afternoons to finish I formulated opinions about characters early on  which in my case is a good sign as it showed I cared about them   they felt real  There were moments I couldn t put the book down as I needed to know what happens next and almost to the very end  it pains me to admit it  I didn t figure out who s the murderer  Hawkins touches on various forms of relationships   marriage  female friendship  parent child  She doesn t try to re invent the wheel or show something we don t already know  Instead  she focused on highlighting how people can impact each other s decisions and doings  how important it is to deal with one s past before it takes over the present  what kind of bond is formed between those who share a live  a house  a secret    It wasn t overcomplicated but nuanced enough for it not to feel silly or like a caricature  The book is well written  Hawkins  style is engaging and makes you come back for more  A definite  yes  for recommendation  Avec ce premier livre  Paula Hawkins ne revolutionne pas le thriller  Vous y trouverez un mort  une enquete et un meurtrier  le tout dans un denouement assez previsible  Rien qui ne change les codes  Alors pourquoi un succes aussi impressionnant   C est vrai  je me suis posee la question car moi aussi  je suis tombee dans les filets de La fille du train  Et la reponse se trouve tout simplement dans son titre  Sa force  La fille du train le doit a ton son aspect psychologique et humain  a ses personnages dont cette fille dans le train  Rachel  L enquete n est qu un pretexte pour nous parler de Monsieur et Madame tout le monde  Le sujet du livre  c est eux  c est vous  c est nous avec nos facades parfaites et nos sombres secrets Donc  ces personnages La narration originale de La fille du train s effectue a trois voix  celles de Rachel  Megan et Anna  Trois femmes que tout semble opposer mais qui vont etre unies par une ville  son train et son meurtre  et d autres choses que nous decouvrirons au fil des pages   Avec une repartition de la parole bien construite  elles vont  l une apres l autre  nous donner leurs points de vue  nous revelant leurs pensees les plus intimes sur les evenements du livre Et cette proximite va nous reveler trois femmes toute aussi antipathique l une que l autre  Mais Paula Hawkins reussie a les rendre humaines  surtout Rachel  A vrai dire  je me suis meme retrouvee en elle  sans les canettes de Gin tonic dans le sac    une femme pas parfaite qui veut juste bien faire les choses  Pourtant  Rachel a vraiment tout pour deplaire   alcoolique  divorcee  chomeuse  squatteuse  menteuse et trop curieuse  Vraiment l inverse d un portrait idyllique  L anti heroine par excellence  Celle  paradoxalement  a laquelle nous finissons par nous y attacher  Et Megan et Anna ne sont pas mieux Mais Rachel est malade  tres malade  Ca n excuse rien  bien au contraire  Sa depression et son alcoolisme atteignent leur paroxysme la nuit du meurtre de Megan  Victime d un grave black out  Rachel ne se souviendra de rien  Paula Hawkins va jouer avec la memoire de Rachel comme elle joue avec le lecteur  Entre fausses pistes et rebondissements  l auteur fait monter la tension et vient rythmer l intrigue de La fille du train L ecriture hyper realiste de Paula Hawkins va donc vous captiver  Qui a tue Megan   Qui sont vraiment les trois heroines   Quel est le lien   Rachel va t elle se souvenir   Tout un tas de questions qui vous tiendra sans difficulte en haleine  Mais des reponses qui auront aussi comme effet de vous rappeler que quelque part  nous sommes tous un peu voyeur dans l ame     http   www celineonline fr la fille d    I did not find this book to be very compelling at the outset  I thought Rachel  the primary narrator  was more annoying than interesting  But I m glad I stuck with it  The story picked up steam as it went along and pulled me in The story unfolds through the alternating perspectives of three first person narrators who have conflicting perspectives on the events that touch all three of them  This unorthodox narrative structure works well for the story  as it keeps the reader guessing  Whose version of the facts  if anyone s  is reliable Were Alfred Hitchcock still alive  this would be a great story for him to adapt into a movie  I understand why people think that this is comparable to Gone Girl  they share a lot of similarities  especially with their use of an unreliable narrator  I really enjoyed it    it was compelling to read  and if life hadn t gotten in the way I probably could ve read it in one sitting  I did see the ending  twist  coming  about halfway through the book  actually  but that didn t make the way that the book played out any less

MAJOR drinking problem  On her daily train commutes to and from London  every time her train stops at a particular signal  she looks out the window at the row of lovely Victorian houses overlooking the tracks There is one house in particular which catches her fancy  and from her vantage point  she enjoys a perfect view of this house and its inmates and richly imagines their lives  giving them imaginary names  thereby reminiscing the kind of life she once used to have  before it all fell apart This is the only thing she really has to look forward to everyday  until one day she happens to see something unbelievably shocking and from thereon  things start unraveling Labeling this book  the next Gone Girl  certainly generated a lot of buzz and it soon became the most talked about book of 2015 As far as the comparisons to Gone Girl are concerned  this book was way better especially in terms of its pace  There were a lot of places in Gone Girl  where I felt things dragged unnecessarily and unbearably  This was a great fast paced creepy psychological thriller  packed with suspense  mystery and intrigue And I certainly know what I m going to vote for in this year s  Goodreads Choice Awards      While reading this I wasn t sure I d give this 4 stars  I was thinking maybe 3   The non linear timeline  the unreliable narrator s   and the general unlikeability of ALL the characters had me grinding my teeth in frustration  There have been a spate of books in recent years with a similar format so it can feel repetitive and overdone  However  as I forced myself to keep reading I realized that the disjointed narrative resulting from these choices is exactly why these types of stories work  especially in this case  Knowing you can t completely trust the information that each narrator shared keeps the reader off balance  uncertain if the conclusions being drawn are the right ones  This feeling perfectly matches Rachel s doubts about her own thoughts and memories  and later  Anna s worries  Even though I figured out  whodunit  pretty early on I felt compelled to keep reading which  as always  is the sign of a  good read  for me    Oh  and for the reviewers  or readers without reviews  who say this is a book for people who don t read I say   hahahahahahahahahaha  good one   Whatever  man  I simultaneously effing loved this  and am really disappointed with this  Disappointed because the ending is one of my wild guesses  I hate when my wild guesses are right  Sigh  I love being wrong  But that s probably the most ridiculous complaint ever  right Especially since I pretty much assumed everyone but the most obvious choice was the killer  It s hard to be wrong when you suspect everybody  Anyway  Now that I ve gotten my whining over with  The story is told from the perspective of three people  two of whom I genuinely wanted to crack over the skull with a rock  The third of whom is dead for 3 4 of the book  Let me tell you  this dynamic is deeply unsatisfying  Rachel is possibly the stupidest human ever on the face of the earth  and she never  gets  better  Bad decisions compound more bad decisions  and it just never stops  I was texting my friend Amberly regularly with screams of   SHE SLEPT WITH WHAT     SHE MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH WHO NOW    Anna can just go die in a fire   Cause really  When we first started getting her perspective  I said nooooooooooooow  Bunny  let s not jump to conclusions  we ve only gotten STUPID Rachel s opinion on Anna thus far  you are being way too hasty and judgemental  Yeah  hasty and judgemental my ass  Go jump in front of a train  Anna  view spoiler  I knew it wasn t Scott  Especially when he started going ape shit  I knew it wasn t the doctor  that wasn t even close to one of my guesses  Pretty early on  I said Tom was having an affair with Megan and killed her for reasons unknown  I also threw out that Anna found out Tom was cheating on her with Megan  and killed her in a jealous rage  I actually would ve liked option 2 even better  But Tom always did seem a little shady Maybe it s because I ve been watching The Blacklist and they have a shady Tom on there  I may be racist again Toms right now  But the minute Rachel said Tom was guilty  I decided he wasn t  Because see above re  Rachel is an idiot Anna overkilling Tom  Probably my favorite part of the entire book   hide spoiler  Solid book  Solid  solid  And the narration is done by three British women  including Molly Hooper herself  and all of my thoughts were British and I was disappointed to watch or listen to anything not with a British accent  Always happy times   I feel like a 4 star rating is still very generous  It just reminded me too much of Gone Girl  And since this book was published years after Gone Girl  I have to give this book a lower rating  I noticed countless similarities  the missing woman  the husband who s involuntarily suspicious  the pregnancy or the constant lies of Amy and Tom are just a few examples  I noticed a lot more motives  To be honest  I couldn t think of anything other than  Gone Girl  while reading this book The plot twist didn t evoke any emotions  while I was blown away with the twist and turns of Gone Girl  While I disliked the characters in both of the books  I felt more with the ones in Gone Girl  I fell in love with the imperfections and I was equally as fascinated as I was frustrated by them I am still rating this book 4 stars  because I would ve been much more impressed if I had read this before Gone Girl  I kept me reading  finished it in one night  and the plot would have been great if it wasn t so similar to another one that I have already read about Usually people are wrong with comparing two books and I m honestly so tired of every book being compared to The Hunger Games etc  I thought this would be one of those times when a book of a certain genre becomes very popular and people start to use it as a sort of criterion to compare other books of that genre to  But it wasn t I feel kind of bad for comparing these two books  because you should base your rating on its content but in this case I think it was necessary  They just had too much in common  I still enjoyed it  this the 4 star rating  and maybe I just read it a little too soon while the memory of Gone Girl was still fresh on my mind  I think comparing this book to Gone Girl really misses the mark  They re both great  but it s like comparing Apples to Oranges  I think it reads more like Before I Go To Sleep  Fast paced thriller with horribly unstable characters makes for a great read  Only 4 stars because for me  by the end of the book it was like someone suddenly slammed on the break and it became predicable  Great read and definitely recommend  Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick   Dirty  A dark and engrossing mystery with a main character that may just grate on some readers  nerves Opening Sentence  She s buried beneath a silver birch tree  down towards the old train tracks  her grave marked with a cairn The Review The Girl on the Train is a dark and engrossing mystery with a main character that may just grate on some readers  nerves  I feel like the less you know about this book going in the better the read will be so I m going to try to be as vague as possible  The leading protagonist is Rachel  She rides a train every day to London for her job  At the beginning she is a bit of a dreamer  imaging the life of a couple she sees almost every day on her way into work  Until the one day that she sees something so reprehensible that she ends up engrossing herself into the life of the couple The main thing that you have to know about Rachel is that she is a severe alcoholic  She constantly drinks to excess and has blackouts  There really isn t much redeemable about her but I found I constantly felt sorry for her even though she keeps putting herself in these situations  Also  it is hard to see her as  reliable  because of her alcoholism I d like to say I knew how it would all play out but thankfully I didn t  I had my own theories that didn t quite match up  I really enjoyed the Red Herrings that were thrown at me throughout the book especially after reading and then thinking back on it There were three POV s  all in the first person  Rachel had the main bulk of the book but you also got insight into two other women s point of views as the story went along  Make sure you double check the names at the beginning of the chapters  it might throw you off  Each of the chapters were even divided into morning or night with the characters thinking back on the events that happened previously  It was a little different but I think it helped my reading experience flow more quickly The Girl on the Train is a drastic change from what I normally read and enjoy  Urban Fantasy Paranormal Romance   It was kind of a nice change  The writing is also a big change from what I m used to so it felt as though I was reading a literary masterpiece  Although that may be a little drastic of a comparison but I enjoyed the writing style  The beginning of the novel had me hooked because I knew nothing and the little insights that were revealed incrementally kept me engrossed then the middle slowed down a bit and I got really frustrated with Rachel but the ending was worth it  I don t really want to say there is a twist but there is definitely something going on This novel was recommended to me by a friend and I am glad I read it  I enjoyed it enough that I would also recommend it but I wouldn t tell someone that it is the greatest book out there because it really isn t but it is a good look into the fact that my life could be so much worse Notable Scene I am no longer travelling to my imaginary office  I have given up the pretence  I can barely be bothered to get out of bed  I think I last brushed my teeth on Wednesday  I am still feigning illness  although I m pretty sure I m fooling no one I can t face getting up  getting dressed  getting onto the train  going into London  wandering the streets  It s hard enough when the sun is shining  it s impossible in this rain  Today is the third day of cold  driving  relentless downpour I m having trouble sleeping  and it s not just the drinking now  it s the nightmares  I m trapped somewhere  and I know that someone s coming  and there s a way out  I know there is  I know that I saw it before  only I can t find my way back to it  and when he does get me  I can t scream  I try  I suck the air into my lungs and I force it out  but there s no sound  just a rasping  like a person fighting for air Sometimes  in my nightmares  I find myself in the underpass by Blenheim Road  the way back is blocked and I cannot go further because there is something there  someone waiting  and I wake in pure terror FTC Advisory  I borrowed a copy of The Girl on the Train from a friend  Really good mystery  End came too quick   In the beginning I didn t like this book  it didn t catch me but when I read more and more I definitely liked it  It s very confusing and you don t know a hundred percent what it will happen in the next chapter  Finally I liked it so much  In conclusion I bought this book for my friend It s more like a 3 5 for me  but I ll give it a 4 Very engrossing and you won t want to put it down once you really get into it  Ending was more satisfying than Gone Girl  but felt rushed  But definitely a good entertaining read   I couldn t put this down  I think it s interesting that this book has been hailed as the next Gone Girl because  aside from the genre and plot involving a missing woman  I didn t find it to be THAT similar  Yes  it s very psychological and features an unreliable narrator in Rachel  but Girl on the Train really stands on its own  It reminded me a lot of Rear Window  The quality of the writing also surprised me  Hawkins writes beautifully  and parts of the beginning reminded me a little of Sylvia Plath  I guessed the twist right before it happened  but that didn t really matter  I still enjoyed it quite a bit  The only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars was because I found myself wanting to know more about Anna and Tom as characters   Den har boken la jag for forsta gangen marke till nar jag gick igenom vilka bocker som skulle slappas i mars  Av vad jag laste trodde jag att den skulle passa mig valdigt bra  Sedan dok den upp pa den ena bokbloggen efter den andra och alla verkade bara tokalska  Vilket fick mig att faktiskt bli mindre sugen pa att lasa den  eftersom det alltid ar jobbigt att lasa bocker som manga last och lyft till skyarna  Men till slut kunde inte jag heller sta emot  Las mer pa http   bokslut blogspot se 2015 05 kv    I ended up liking this  despite hating all the characters  Maybe the denouement was a bit too tidy  but it was still a compelling story  Enjoyed the audiobook version of this book  Kept me guessing what exactly the outcome would be   Rachel is a lonely alcoholic who enjoys people watching during her daily commute  She particularly likes observing  Jess  and  Jason   who she views as a perfect couple with a perfect life  However  one day she sees something surprising through the train window  Although she may be doing more harm than good  Rachel decides to become involved in the ensuing investigation I always love a good page turner   The Girl on the Train  focuses on three unhappy  unreliable  and unlikeable women  If you need to like characters in order to enjoy a book  skip this one  The mystery kept me thoroughly engrossed  and I finished the book in about a week  Although I guessed the ending a bit early and sometimes the characters were frustrating  I really enjoyed this overall  Strong female characters don t necessarily mean good female characters  They can be weak  but strongly written  vibrant and real and engaging  The three women at the centre of this book are by turns infuriating  pathetic  and heartbreaking  I can t count the number of times I rolled my eyes and grumped  oh for god s sake Rachel    Yet the book was all the more compelling for the characters being so real  and so flawed   Vamo la  A Garota no Trem Eu comecei a ler intensivamente com romances policiais  entao esse sempre foi um genero muito querido pra mim  Isso dito  da pra dizer que foi uma leitura prazerora O crime era bem meh  dava pra autora ter feito tanta coisa mais legal com isso  motivo tosquissimo e mais ou menos na metade do livro ja tava meio obvio qual seria a resolucao final  Inclusive o final ficou meio aberto pra mim  achei que faltou dar um pouco mais de norte pra Rachel O que mais gostei  na verdade  e que justifica a quarta estrela  foi a Rachel  Como foi doloroso ve la se deteriorando com o alcool  querendo parar e nao conseguindo  indo sutilmente para a proxima garrafa e prometendo que ia ser a ultima  Senti muita pena dela e talvez por isso tenha esperado um final mais feliz pra ela Os outros personagens nao me cativaram muito  Megan uma chata  Anna uma ridicula  Tom e Scott idem  Quem mais tinha potencial  o ruivo do trem  nao foi bem explorado  Entao foi um livro com varias boas oportunidades perdidas  So suspenseful   this was a quick read  It was also devastating due to many unreliable narrators  This is a great escape book if you need a mini vacation from the real world  WOW  What a thrill ride this was  I loved the way the author structured the book  moving the two timelines slowly closer and closer  not revealing the mystery until the two come together  The characters are extremely memorable   Rachel is just brilliant  A fascinating portrayal  This is an adult novel with some disturbing content  but a brilliantly constructed and executed book  For those who enjoy thrillers and mysteries  this is a great read       Todas estas mulheres tem algum problema por tras  Todas tem os seus demonios e  apesar de inicialmente se renderem face a estes  acabam por tentar lutar contra eles da melhor forma que sabem Foi um livro que gostei imenso e com uma reviravolta final de que o leitor comeca a desconfiar a determinada altura  Gostei imenso e aconselho sem reservas  Um livro que ira fazer as delicias dos fas do genero  E nao se deixem ir abaixo se o inicio nao vos prender  verao que vale a pena Opiniao completa em http   blocodedevaneios blogspot pt 2    Talk about rising action  Twists and turns  a suspenseful thriller  a page turner  The characters were believable and you couldn t help but feel for them  although they were despicable  Maybe the characters just seemed  real  with their baggage  hopes  dreams  and delusions  If you liked Gone Girl  you will like this   No estoy muy segura de si he amado este libro locamente o no Y   como se puede dudar algo asi  os preguntareis Pues bien  la historia en si es    rara  Y quiero decir con esto que es diferente  es hasta morbosa No es una novela juvenil  tampoco adulta pero tiene esa chispa que mucha novela juvenil no tiene y que  en ocasiones  se agradece El principio es lento  muy lento  Me costo bastante tiempo engancharme  no hacia mas que empezarlo y dejarlo  empezarlo y dejarlo  pero habia leido buenas criticas y queria darle una oportunidad me gustase o no He de decir que absolutamente ningun personaje me ha caido bien  Rachel es medio tonta  Megan otra que tal baila  Pero aun asi segui leyendo Y menos mal Llega un momento en la historia que no puedes dejar de pensar que todo el culpa de Rach   nospoilers  pero no quieres que lo sea porque  en el fondo  te da pena y sabes que si hubieses pasado por lo mismo tampoco dejarias de beber  Y odias a Anna  quieres odiarla  pero tampoco puedes porque sabes que en esa situacion estarias igual  Y entonces quieres odiar a Tom  que es un capullo  pero el amor es asi Entonces vuelves a mirar   mirar   vale   mal a Rach y quieres odiar al menos a Megan  pero tampoco puedes porque  joder  lo ha pasado mal Y ya paras de leer  vas a por una tila y bajas a la calle a por el libro que has tirado por la ventana despues de tanto estres  esta bien  tranquilos  vivo en un segundo  para aclararte y ver a quien odias mas y a quien odias menos  porque al fin y al cabo no se salva nadie En fin  es un libro lento pero cuando estas llegando al final y empiezas a sacar tus propias conclusiones es hasta interesante  Pero si tienes problemas con la bebida no lo leas   En serio hay latas de gin tonic  Primera noticia  It s as good as the hype  I enjoyed it  though I figured out who done it before it was revealed  The characters were well written and in particular the character of Rachel and her sections of the story put you in her head a little too well  Her scenes felt oppressive at times   A very good psychological thriller   kept my interest right to the end  Read it   WOWZA  The Girl on the Train is a  who done it  type of book  It did take me a bit to get into it but once I did  it was hard to put down  The story kept getting crazier the more I continued to read  I have to admit I suspected everyone at one point or another  All three narrators were unhappy  complex and not entirely sympathetic  Basically  they were a a hot mess  This author has a different style than Gillian Flynn  It s a good psychological thriller if that s what you re looking for  I highly recommend it  How do you review a book in which more than 50  of the time you spend inside the head of someone you aren t too keen on  I liked the book  I liked the story  I liked the unfolding of the mystery  But I really didn t like the lead protagonist  Rachel  She s a bit pathetic  and whiny  and crazy  The book opens with Rachel as the narrator  She s sitting on the train  She s watching the homes slide by and she makes up stories about the lives of the people who live within the homes  She has no life of her own  She did  but now she doesn t  She s an alcoholic  She makes terrible choices  She gets drunks and rings her ex husband  She watches his home from the train like a real voyeur  She injects herself into events that do not concern her to add some interest to her life  And yes  you have to spend endless passages inside this woman s head  It s frustrating  I guess it might be the kind of frustration that comes with living with a real alcoholic  The endless backsliding and promises not to repeat  The next person you spend that much time with is Megan  She s vague and doesn t seem to really do much  She sees a therapist  She s got some issues  She has a confession  a breath catching  eyes starting to water as I listen on my long run  confession  It s heart breaking  I end up liking her despite myself  The last narrator is Anna  the new wife of Rachel s ex  She s irritating and holier than thou  even though she snatched away Rachel s husband and liked it  I liked her even less than Rachel I think my main problem is that you spend so much time in melancholy with Rachel and Megan that it starts to rub off on you  There s really no joy in the book  So  why did I like the book  The writing is fantastic  The narrative voices of the three main characters are distinct  The plot is great  although it does get a bit slow in some parts  And I liked the mystery aspect to it   I really wish I could give this book 4 5 stars  Did it completely blow my mind  Not quite  The female leads  though well drawn and real feeling  were all a bit off putting  for various personal reasons to do with who they are as characters   Too whiny  too selfish  All that is very subjective  though  Not something wrong with the novel  just my own response to those characters   But it s an excellent story  well told  I couldn t put it down  Highly recommended  What a fun read  But Girl on the Train is definitely not this summer s Gone Girl as it has so often been billed  That book had a complicated plot hatched by a devious sociopath and it was fun to try to stay a step ahead  Girl on the Train isn t about a plot  it is about the hazy memory of an alcoholic  No brilliant twists  just a slow reclamation of a witnessed scene Interestingly  it is a book that provokes reflection on a number of smaller issues  Exactly what does a canned gin and tonic taste like   Sounds pretty good actually and highly potent   What s up with the divorce laws in England  Why and how does the philanderer get to keep everything in its place  including the favorite chair and all of the cutlery  while the betrayed wife gets the clothes on her back  What is the source of Cathy s compassion and support   She s the most ethical and potentially interesting of the characters  but is barely developed   Has Rachel always had such a weak stomach or is it the booze  Why does she so seldom clean up after herself  What makes so many of them men such slobs  particularly when they have invested in expensive homes Read this book on the beach and enjoy  I read this book in two nights  It is an easy  fast paced read   I think the book starts off really well and builds up a good plot  The characters in the book are depressed  insecure and have variety of psychological issues  Halfway through the story does get repetitive though and stretched  some characters seem useless to the storyline and others seem to have similar psychological traits  All in all  it was a good read but could have been shorter and more focused  Daaaaaaammmn  This is one messed up group of people whose lives are portrayed in this book  I have to admit  it s a pretty clever concept for a whodunit  Page turning chick lit  Yep  that s it    Wow  This was a crazy train ride  It is in my favourite format   different P O V s with flashbacks  so I was on board right from the start   Usually  I have a whodunit theory but this time I had no idea  I will not say more   no spoilers  I m an American male in my thirties so you d think a story about crazy British ladies who drink too much might not go over well with me  but it did I enjoyed the characters  This is a character story  They re all very flawed but have their own charms  The decisions they make are true to their characters and it s fun to see certain characters interact with each other The story went on a little too long  but not by much  At a certain point you figure out where the story is going and you re just waiting for the characters to catch up  That can be frustrating but luckily this story doesn t make you wait too long I liked how even though our main character is a boozehound we never go with her to the bars or experience her getting wasted  It s always right before or after and it begins to feel that this is just how she is  It would be like wasting paper to describe a character breathing  it s assumed  As is Rachel s drinking  I liked that I listened to the audiobook and the voice actors did a great job  I would suggest the audiobook if you re on the fence on how you want to take the story in  A good debut book by Paula HawkinsRachel takes the same train everyday morning and night and the train halts everyday where she can see the street and houses on that street where she had lived with her ex husband Tom  She cannot get over that their marriage is over  She takes to alcohol to dull the pain that she cannot have a child  She sees a couple some houses down the street she lived and they seem to be so much in love  Her ex still lives in the same house with his new wife and a baby daughter and the thought really kills Rachel Rachel watches a couple everyday on their deck having their morning coffee when the train stops at the signal and they seemed to be having a wonderful relationship  She gives them imaginary names and tries to fathom how good their life must be  Until she sees something for a second before the train moves one day and changes the whole course of her future in a way she never imaginedThe book keeps you guessing and one can never imagine how the different characters are drawn together is this drama which comes to a surprising end  It is dark and gripping and it sometimes makes you wonder whether the author tried hard to get every character together in a very unrealistic scenario  But a good read  4 5 stars  I really enjoyed this  I solved the mystery pretty early on  but I liked the way it was revealed piece by piece and out of chronological order  Excellent use of unreliable narrators  Mostly  though  this book confirms for me my reasons for never ever drinking alcohol  I mean  seriously  Nothing but trouble comes of it  Captivating read  Unlike all of the declarations  this book is not like  Gone Girl   This author has written a completely different  whodunnit  with a twist  The only spoiler like comment I will make is that the writing is so good that I wanted to clock the main character several times throughout the story   4  for it s genre    a beach read   a mystery  It s fun   quickly paced  forcing you to keep turning pages quickly  It was addicting   a nice distraction  I have no doubt my book club will find things to talk about  as per usual     just the right amount of crazy to keep me reading This book hooked me from the first page  It was fast paced book with a good plot  All along the novel I wanted a character to root for but nah  I ended up getting angry and frustrated at each of them  I keep reading that it is similar to gone girl and having read both of these I d like to point out that they are quite different from each other  Gone girl gives out stronger vibes and shakes you whereas you only pity the characters in the girl on the train   Very interesting book  I always love books that make you think you understand everything and then at the end make you realize you didn t understand a thing  GIRL ON THE TRAIN   a deliciously haunting psychological thriller by British journalist Paula Hawkins    an inventive debut and exploration of obsession  love  violence  secrets  lies  and betrayal Told from alternating perspectives of three women  Rachel is  the girl on the train    She is her 30s  divorced  unemployed  and an alcoholic  She rides the train every day into London so the friend she is staying with will not notice she has no job  On her daily commute into London from the suburbs  the train often stops near Rachel s old house  where she lived with her former husband  Tom  From her train window  she imagines a happy life as she gazes into the yards and windows of her former neighbors  She is childless  lonely  and buries herself in a bottle  her life is a total train wreck   Rachel dislikes Anna who is married to her ex husband Tom  She dreams of a perfect life  She resents their life  the life which should have been hers   with husband and baby  On the route  she passes this house and sees this loving couple she calls Jason and Jess  as imagines their happy life  Until one day she sees the woman kissing another man and then her fantasy world is crushed  Then she realizes the woman is missing and learns their true identity  She gets the police involved and the drama begins What is real and what is an illusion  Due to her blackouts  is she a credible witness Anna  is married to Rachel s ex husband  Tom and they have a baby  Rachel is envious of Anna  as she wanted to have a baby but Tom said they could not afford all the fertility tests  Anna is very self centered  and preferred the glamour and intrigue of being the other woman  Rachel often stalks them  sneaking into their house and trying to take their baby  Tom and Anna thinks Rachel has lost it  as Rachel is drunk most of the time and does not recall things she has done   blacks out  Megan  is Anna s neighbor and Rachel has an obsession with Megan and her husband Scott  whose house she passes every day on her train into London   She imagined them as originally as  Jason and Jess   Megan s part flashes back in time prior to her disappearance  She s manic  but hasn t quite come to terms with two extremely tragic events in her past  Anna  meanwhile  just wants a quiet  picket fence kind of existence with Tom and their child  She s grown to hate Rachel  who s having a hard time leaving their family alone  with continuous stalking  Now  what you have here  is a mix of stalker  alcoholic  demented  dark  lonely  violent  self absorbed  obsessive  compulsive  addictive  insecure  jealous  and selfish wacky women who have no life   Hilarious  right    However  Hawkins keeps you hooked as you hear from each woman  as a reader  you want to murder all of them The shocking and gripping thriller delivers many twists and turns  taking you on a dark engrossing ride   Rachel blacks out  someone is a murderer  and someone is lying  A fine line between love and hate  this drama will have you racing to the end to learn the fate of these three women and how they are connected  Oh  and the men in their lives who are not as they seem  A page turner  to learn the identity of the master manipulator  I listened to the audiobook  narrated by Clare Corbett  Louise Brealey  and India Fisher  keeping the suspense high with different voices  At times I wanted to smack these women and became patient with them  however  I enjoyed The Girl on the Train  more than Gone Girl but less than The Good Girl  Hawkins explores highly charged psychological  social  and contemporary topics of abuse  physical  verbal  and emotional   as well as addictions  She examines middle class women s lives from different perspectives as wives  mothers  divorced  childless  and the mistress  views   how each personality views a situation or person  differently Get on board the crazy train  for hours of humor and entertainment  as Hawkins cleverly weaves emotional  dark  and complex   with extensive character studies and insights  If you enjoy dark psycho thrillers  this one is for you  Looking forward to more from this highly creative author  and the movie  Enjoyed reading her inspiration behind the novel  and her thought process for the character development   Judith D  Collins Must Read Books  Definitely kept my attention even though I loathed most of the characters   The Girl on The Train by British author Paula Hawkins  is a novel that debuted number one on the New York Times Fiction Best Sellers 2015  It has been compared many times to the book  and subsequent movie  Gone Girl by American author Gillian Flynn  Although I can see some similarities in theme of a darker  more twisted plot and context  I genuinely feel the similarities are like comparing apples and oranges  Yes  they are both fruit  but they both have very different tastes  textures and looks  The Girl on The Train is about a thirty something year old woman named Rachel who rides the commuter train daily to London  During her ride  as she watches out the window  she always notices the back of a particular set of row houses at one of the stops along her way  One of the homes belongs to her ex husband  where she used to live with him before he left her for his current wife  Anna  Another house a few doors down belong to a couple she doesn t know  but whom she always sees outside on their back porch  and she takes an almost obsessive interest in them  She creates names for them  she refers to them as Jess and Steve  and a complete back story of what she believes their lives together must be like  You definitely get a sense right away that Rachel is very lonely and deeply affected by the affair her ex husband had on her with his current wife  who now lives in her old home with him and their new baby   but where things get even more intricate to the plot is that we learn early on that Rachel is an alcoholic and was actually fired from her job months prior to the opening of the story for being drunk at work  She rides the train daily as a way to hide her job loss from her roommate  One day Rachel sees something significant in regards to  Jess  as her train passes the row houses  and later when news reports reveal that  Jess   who is really named Megan  her husband s name is really Scott  has gone missing  Rachel emerges herself into the situation to try and help find her because she feels a real  rather inexplicable  connection with this woman  The real interesting twists and turns in this story relate back to Rachel s alcoholism  A lot of things she sees or remembers  or doesn t remember for that matter  have to be taken with a grain of salt because we don t know what is real and what is actually inaccurate do to her being intoxicated the majority of the time  There are a lot of holes in her memory due to black outs and that makes the whole unfolding of this plot  the twists and turns  and the mystery so intriguing  At times  even aside from her intoxication  I found myself wondering if she was actually mentally ill  You really want to pull for her because she is for all proses the story s heroine  and is the main character  but you just don t know what is real and what isn t There is also a lot of side plot in regards to her ex husband  his new wife  and how that whole situation affected Rachel and ties into her current situation  and the situation with the missing woman  Megan  The way Paula Hawkins tied all this together was pure brilliance  Every other chapter of this  What happened   and  Who may have done it   kept me changing my mind constantly  I never had a direct  I figured it out   moment until the very end  The only thing I can say that was a negative was in the beginning  until you really figure out who is who amongst the characters  it gets a little confusing because the author switches points of view each chapter  and the fact that Rachel makes up names for two of the characters in the beginning doesn t help with the confusion of keeping things straight   Also each chapter takes place on different dates  So the dates jump from past to present and then back again throughout the book  That was a little hard to keep straight for me at first  but once I got into the story  and all of the characters were sorted out in my mind  I was completely sucked in and couldn t put it down  I highly recommend this book and I give it 5 Stars  It s an easy read length wise  too  so it s a perfect book to read on vacation or on lunch breaks  The movie rights were already purchased by Dreamworks in 2014 and actress Emily Blunt is in talks to play the leading role of Rachel  If people want to compare this book to Gone Girl then I can only say that with the success of that movie  I think this movie will do the same  So definitely jump on it now before the movie comes out http   www onceuponatwilight com 2015    I thought this was a fantastic book  I figured out the ending before it happened but it was very interesting and suspenseful  You sympathize with Rachael and what she is going through   I feel like listening to this book rather than reading it really added to my enjoyment of the story  The narrators are all good  but Clare Corbett  who does the bulk of the performance is spectacular  Her performance allows the listener to experience everything right along with the character  When she panics  you panic  when she s angry you re angry  and when she s feeling lost and alone  you feel the same thing   I m not sure quite what to say about  Girl on the Train   If you like thrillers  there is a reason it s a bestseller  I liked it A Cautionary tale about matrimonial infidelity  alcohol abuse and domestic violence  Recommended to anyone who is not depressed and looking for a thought provoking  mind blowing story that resembles life too much  Overall this book is worth reading   4 5 Stars I started reading this book last night before sleep  and finished it this morning  And what can I say  I want to read more thrillers after this  Plot  I went into this aware of the similarities with Gone Girl  and sincerely hoped she wouldn t pull a similar twist on us midway  Without spoiling things  all I can say now is that this was a unique read  and I didn t see the big reveal coming  Not until it was close  The pacing was a bit slow in the sense that it allowed me to anticipate it before the big reveal  But I was still shocked in spite of it  One thing I found fault with earlier  but later stopped finding fault with  was Rachel s problem with alcoholism and her retrograde amnesia  I felt those black outs were convenient for the plot  but the more the plot unfolded  the more I became sure that it was actually ingenious on the part of the author  being able to use that so well and how it actually fit into the plot  Rachel s alcoholism tied in well with her past  and the present  Overall  I have no complaints about the pacing  it is a unique novel because the pacing was a bit slow  sometimes  it seemed nothing was really happening for a stretch  and I expected more leads  more findings  more police investigations etc  but still intriguing enough that I couldn t even have breakfast until I finished it Characters  The story was told from the POVs of three women  each of them flawed  with Rachel being the most disturbing personality to me  I found her weakness pitiable and very annoying sometimes  but I was glad that her character arc underwent a transformative arch  even if it s temporary  who knows   to become strong and assertive at the end  An unsung female character that I really loved in the book was Cathy  how she supported Rachel in spite of Rachel s sickening alcoholism  the true example of female friendship  There were also three men in the book  four if you counted the red haired man on the train  all of them flawed  I would have loved if we got more glimpse into Kamal s life though  Overall  this was a great read and I definitely see myself reading more thrillers in the near future  A well written mystery  Kept you guessing until the end although a little slow in parts  The last ten pages are worth reading the other 315  Good read  This is a great book  I couldn t put it down  Read it in a few days  which is rare for me  It was a bit predictable toward the end and  although a good ending  not a happy one  Not for me anyway  Quite easy to guess the conclusion of the book  not as thrilling as I was expecting  But  even so  I liked Paula Hawkins  writing  This is a good psychological thriler  I liked the characters  but I couldn t get very attached to them some how  I feel like some characters were extra just to fill some pages and to explain some situations  like Cathy  Rachel s roommate  Cathy was also the only sane character  it seemed The book is written from the perspective of the three main female characters   Rachel  the alcoholic ex wife  Meghan  the missing protagonist  and Anna   the new wife of Tom  Rachel s ex husband Many plots and twists ensue  When I started the book  I wasn t paying close attention to the chapter headings which are important  very important  They tell you when the events are happening  Once I figured out that the author was skipping back and forth between the past  the present and the future  I could follow the story a lot easier The story is narrated by three women  You ll easily be able to keep their stories separate although their lives do intertwine in strange ways I don t want to say too much because it s too easy to write spoilers  It s a good story  very well told and I d recommend it  Great book     Although none of the characters in this book isbterribly likeable  by the end of a thrilling ride the fragility of at least two is explained and the psychological background that is more than hinted at by the conclusion makes you shudder at your earlier responses to them  A clever thriller  which might be compared to Gone Girl  unreliable narrators aplenty here  but which I enjoyed rather more  set as it is in a suburban Britain well known for hiding all sorts of nastly little secrets    Page turner  Contrived ending  What a ride  I have been in such a reading slump  Working like crazy and hardly any time to read  When I did have time  I just could not get into anything  I must have started about 15 or more books reading numerous pages and just giving up  Then I picked up The Girl on the Train  I was immediately hooked  I couldn t put it down  I stayed up late reading it  read it during making dinner  practically tuned my husband out so I could just read a bit more  I would tell anyone I talk to to read this one  I would give it more of a 4 5  Not a 5 because I would not read it again    because I know what happens      I look forward to reading more from this author in the future  I see that it now to be made into a movie and I ll be interested to see what they do with this book  I will not give a synopsis of the book as its been done so much already  I will just say this is a must read for those who love a good thriller  I ve never read a book so fast  Couldn t put it down   I really enjoyed The Girl on the Train It s very cleverly written and Hawkins weaves many strands together into a gorgeous tapestry  Very satisfying ending  REVIEW ORIGINALLY POSTED HERE  TWENTY THREE OWLS I love people watching  There s just something so captivating about making up this whole life for someone else based only upon what you see in front of you  I decided to read this little thriller mainly because pretty much everyone was reading it and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about  I m pleased to say that all the fuss is correct  This is one damn good book  I loved the grittiness of it  I loved how raw it was and how it stole your breath away when you least expected it Paula Hawkins basically makes you hate all the characters  She makes everyone a suspect  Every one including the baby  But where was the baby  I m just kidding It was such a refreshing change to see characters that were so messed up and unlovable  I guess that s why it has been compared to Gillian Flynn s  Gone Girl  a lot  I absolutely hated every character with a vengeance  I would find myself standing in the shower sometimes and I would be thinking of the characters and having this huge ranting session in my head about why they are douchebags  Then I would leave the shower  pulsing with fury only to pick up book again because I had to know what happened This story is told from the point of view of three highly unreliable and unstable narraters  You never know who is telling the truth  who is lying and who simply cannot for the life of her remember what happened  Rachel is the forgetful alcoholic  Anne is the lying second wife and Megan is the neurotic cheat  They have all been robbed of the fullness of life and they are all grieving for what could have been  Together they work to bring three lives together into the big mystery of what happened on Saturday night  Everyone keeps secrets  Everyone The reason why this book didn t get the full 5 stars from me was because I felt like the conclusion was weak  I didn t like how the book ended  I felt like it was overly dramatic  But that s the only flaw I could find  Now go out there and get your hands on this book because it is one hell of a good story  Like Gone Girl  The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins explores the dark  dark  DARK   through the inner workings of an incredibly  complex  woman  In this case  it s a trio of very different  but equally compelling and unpredictable  women  And  like Gone Girl  I read the entire book in a single sitting  Rachel Watson  our divorced  alcoholic protagonist  fulfills the role of unreliable narrator as a lonely London commuter with a vivid imagination  Each day  twice a day  her slow moving train lumbers past the affluent  tree lined neighborhood where she used to live with her ex husband  and where she spots and imagines a perfect life for a neighboring golden couple  whom she refers to as  Jason and Jess   And the mystery begins  As a voyeur who has frequent blackouts and admits she doesn t even trust herself  Rachel is at once a sympathetic character who  at the same time  can t fully be trusted Without giving away too much of the plot  the novel s trio of narrators helps add to the suspense    just when you start getting acquainted with one character  you realize that you might be hearing the thoughts of someone evil   or someone who is no longer alive by book s end  Consequently  readers will have a hard time resisting a race through the chapters Unlike Gone Girl  The Girl On the Train has none of the dark humor  aside from perhaps a biting satirical commentary on the banality of the suburbs  particularly for stay at home moms    referred to several times as the  Pilates Starbucks Book Club  posse  And motherhood is surely a motif  if not a heavy handed one  running through the book  Overall  this novel instantly strikes a dissonant tone  creates a somber  lonesome and desperate mood  and offers up dark  haunting detail    and in Rachel  introduces a character not soon to be forgotten  It s practically a sure thing that this book will be swiftly snatched up by Hollywood  following the same award winning path as its Gillian Flynn penned predecessor   Wow what an exhausting roller coaster I have to admit there is a lot to work through in your mind while reading this book  Once you get your mind wrapped around the different characters  their POV s and the past  present timelines it is quite the ride  The writing style in this book reminds me of Gone Girl      there are parts that seem to drag a bit due to the level of detail  but in the end you realize the detail is required in order for the story to come together  I enjoyed this twisted read   Ja tive oportunidade de dizer anteriormente  mas volto a reforcar  que fico sempre um pouco de pe atras quando surgem comparacoes entre livros ou sugestoes do genero  para fas de      A  Rapariga do Comboio  tem sido bastante recomendada a quem gostou de  Em Parte Incerta  de Gillian Flynn  livro que nao me cativou de todo  De qualquer forma  continuava curiosa com a sinopse apresentada  pelo que nao pude deixar de aproveitar a oportunidade criada pela Topseller  que cedeu ao blog um exemplar avancado para leitura e opiniao honesta antes do lancamento oficial do livro  gesto pelo qual estamos gratas   Terminada a leitura  posso dizer que este livro e de facto para os fas da Gillian  mas tambem para os que nao gostaram das suas obras  Melhor que isso   A Rapariga no Comboio  e para os fas da Paula Hawkins Para quem realiza diariamente viagens mundanas de comboio  e perceptivel o fascinio com este modo de transporte e para a certa nuance magica que lhe surge associada  Foi tambem esse embalo inicial que criou uma ligacao de empatia com Rachel  a personagem que me acompanhou ao longo de mais de 300 paginas  Esta personagem e bastante peculiar  pelo grau de complexidade que lhe e atribuido mas tambem pela facilidade de acesso as diversas camadas que a compoem  e que vao sendo reveladas em diversos momentos da obra  intercalados de forma engenhosa para inebriar o leitor e deixa lo com varias suspeitas e muito poucas certezas  Perdida  com instintos acertados  varios questionamentos justificados e uma serie de momentos que ate poderiam ser considerados hilariantes  nao fosse uma clara analise individual e social da sua condicao  esta Rapariga que viaja diariamente de Comboio foi uma surpresa constante e pela qual dei por mim a torcer  mesmo nos momentos em que ela nao merecia  Alias  estava tao concentrada nela nas primeiras paginas que so ao fim de quatro capitulos me apercebi que o livro e contado sob dois pontos de vista  pelas maos de Rachel e Megan  obrigando me a recomecar para me posicionar correctamente   Parecendo uma enorme distracao da minha parte  a verdade e que as historias diferenciadas sobrepoem postos de construcao  As duas personagens confluem na sua essencia em algumas coisas  pelo que criam uma voz comum entre ambas  sem lhes negar uma personalidade forte e vincada  As duas estao condoidas com preambulos da vida  fragilizadas  marcadas por arrependimentos e cenarios mais cinzentos  e procuram qualquer coisa  mesmo que nao saibam que o fazem ou o que pretendem de facto  Sao muito vividas  destacando se pela forma transformadora como se envolvem com as restantes personagens secundarias e que criam uma rede de tensoes  suspeita  suspense e misterio que agarra qualquer leitor ate a ultima pagina  A accao esta enquadrada de uma forma engenhosa  apoiando se num estilo de escrita bastante lucido  que se entranha  e que nos faz querer avancar para a proxima pagina  descobrindo as consequencias de cada passo dado pelas personagens  de forma acertada ou nao  ao longo de um jogo de incerteza e porque nao  de sobrevivencia Rachel e Megan levam nos para uma viagem constante entre o presente o passado  pelo constraste do mundo idealizado e das transformacoes aparentes que podem acontecer com um piscar de olhos  ou com um comboio parado ao pe de um sinal por breves minutos   A analise que estas mulheres proporcionam ao leitor esta sempre em mutacao  seja pela apresentacao de detalhes singulares  por uma frase dita aparentemente sem significado  por uma revelacao inesperada ou pela necessidade constante de o colocar a tentar adivinhar os seus proximos passos E essencialmente um jogo intelectual  a altura de um thriller de mao cheia  que se entranha na mente de quem o le ate que todas pecas encaixem e facam sentido novamente  E embora nao componha um cenario tao perturbador como o prometido  numa logica de constrastes visuais   A Rapariga no Comboio  faz nos certamente pensar se a parte mais arrepiante das nossas vidas nao sera o facto de nunca conseguirmos conhecer prever realmente o comportamento de alguem  Nem o do vizinho do lado  nem das pessoas com quem partilhamos lacos afectivos  nem de quem nos ve do outro lado do espelho Nao percam a oportunidade de lancar a mao a este livro  que sera editado em Portugal a 8 de Junho pela Topseller  edicao  o lancamento foi adiantado para 5 de junho     Claudia A very enjoyable read  I am not sure that I would describe this book as a thriller  even though there is a mystery and a degree of suspense  It is very character driven and the ending is much more  well that makes sense  rather than  whoah  didn t see that coming  There are three narrators   two very messed up  one rather vacuous and frankly not very nice   and whether you enjoy the story may depend to a great extent on how sympathetic you find them  This is not a book for those who like uncomplicated characters who think about very little other than their hair  Personally I thought they were honestly depicted  frustrating but still  in 2 cases out of 3  likeable and I couldn t put the book down until I had found out what happened to them   Different kind of thriller  Intriguing sometimes weird but in a good way  Nao posso dizer que achei este livro brilhante  que o considere uma obra prima ou que o va ler outra vez Mas uma coisa nao nego  prendeu me a atencao e a curiosidade do inicio ao fim e nao consegui parar de le lo  porque a autora conseguiu imprimir lhe uma aura de misterio e de  suspense  quase ate ao seu final O livro  alem de ser uma especie de policial  em que se deseja muito avancar para descobrir quem foi o autor do assassinio de uma jovem mulher atormentada pelo passado  fala nos de outros temas interessantes  como a fragilidade da vida  das relacoes humanas e da decadencia da sociedade moderna 1  A maioria das pessoas  mesmo com vidas estaveis  casamentos mais ou menos felizes  amigos e profissoes de que gostam   podem  em determinadas circunstancias em que se encontram mais fragilizadas  cair numa espiral de auto destruicao  onde se perde tudo  depois de se refugiarem no alcool ou em outros vicios 2  A maioria de nos tambem pensa que a vida dos outros e sempre mais perfeita que a nossa 3  Quantos de nos  que andamos de comboio  de autocarro ou ate a pe  sentimos curiosidade em espreitar para a casa e para a intimidade dos outros  imaginando como sera a vida dessas pessoas 4  Quantos de nos  somos alvo ou somos os proprios sujeitos de juizos de valor sobre o que deve ser uma vida perfeita e aceitavel de acordo com as convencoes sociais vigentes  que  quer queiramos  quer nao  se impoem sobretudo as mulheres adultas  as quais  so podem ser felizes ou bem sucedidas  se forem casadas  se tiverem filhos  se forem boas profissionais  se forem atraentes e bem dispostas  Se se esta triste e se nao se reunir estas condicoes  e porque se falhou Deste modo  muitos passam a vida a fingir perante os outros e  sobretudo  perante si proprios  o que aconteceu nos relacionamentos sobre que trata o livro  em que as personagens nao conheciam verdadeiramente com quem estavam casadas Gostei da personagem principal  Rachel  a ex mulher alcoolica  deprimida  solitaria  desempregada  que observava e imaginava a vida de um casal jovem no jardim da sua casa  nas viagens que diariamente fazia de comboio  pois preocupava se com os outros  e porque  apesar dos constantes erros que cometia  era muito humana  sensivel e verdadeira Gostei da circunstancia deste livro ter sido narrado  de forma intercalada  por tres mulheres distintas  mas com relacoes entre si  que expunham as suas visoes diferentes sobre os mesmos acontecimentos Finalmente  gostei de uma personagem secundaria  a Cathy  que  apesar de nao ter sido dada muita relevancia a mesma  ate pela propria Rachel  que nao a via como uma amiga proxima  esta ultima so nao se afundou mais  porque aquela  enquanto sua senhoria e amiga  nunca a chegou a expulsar de casa e tentou ajuda la de diversas formas E tambem um erro frequente que muitos cometem  nao dar relevo a pessoas que acham ser desinteressantes e insignificantes  e que menosprezam  mas que sao importantes  porque se sobrevalorizamos uns  estamos totalmente desatentos em relacao a outros   As much as I hate to compare this to Gone Girl  it s practically inevitable  Both novels alternate narrators in the same diary entry format  Both feature bad marriages  a dead female and surrounding criminal investigation  and shady characters who you can t trust  Despite all these similarities  I still enjoyed Gone Girl more than The Girl on the Train  I found Amy Dunne was far deeper and more compelling than any of the characters in this novel  She is a twisted mastermind whose narration is thrilling to read  whereas the characters in The Girl on the Train were a bit stereotypical  alcoholic divorced wife whose life is a mess  bitter new wife who is jealous of husband s connection with ex  manipulative husband who can t stop cheating and lying  etc   The plot twists in The Girl on the Train were somewhat predictable and less surprising to me as well  That being said  I still enjoyed the book and liked its fast paced plot  The Girl on the Train is Paula Hawkins  debut thriller  and it provides quite a ride  Whose story is reliable  Is anyone s story reliable  This is told from the points of view of Megan  Anna  and Rachel  and is also told from a period of time in 2013  with a few flashbacks to 2012 Rachel s life has fallen apart  Her marriage has dissolved  she has a drinking problem  often experiencing blackouts  and she has lost her job  To keep her roommate from learning this  Rachel continues to take the train daily  as if going to work  The train consistently stops at particular spots along the line  one of these happens to be a house near the one where Rachel lived when she was married  It is there that she sees a happily married couple who she names Jason and Jess  and she looks forward to seeing them on her way to and from the city each day Meanwhile  Rachel continues to contact her ex husband  Tom  who has married Anna and now has a baby girl  Rachel s contacts feel like harassment to Anna  but Tom continues to assure Anna that he is handling the situation One day  Rachel sees something that causes her to escalate her intrusion into the lives of her ex husband and his wife  and also brings her into the lives of  Jason  and  Jess  when Jess disappears This was a gripping read  and I enjoyed the cat and mouse aspects of the story  I also learned that an alcoholic blackout is not a condition where the drinker forgets events  This type of blackout occurs because when highly intoxicated  the brain can t create short term memories and therefore  there is nothing to remember the next day Rachel s behaviors may seem too crazy to be believed  but if she is an alcoholic and feels as if her life has spiraled out of control  her poor decisions seemed appropriate to me as a reader  This book evoked such a strong reaction in me  My heart raced and I felt fear for the characters  I had strong feelings for each of them especially Anna  But by the end I wasn t sure how I felt towards any of them  they were real to me  human  This book showed me what others will do for survival and for maintaining the status quo  It read a little like a lifetime movie and was slow towards the beginning  The ending too  though I didn t figure it out right away  seemed sort of predictable in a lifetime sort of way   Truly no offense to those who enjoy those movies   But those are the only reasons I gave it one star less  pontuacao  3 5 estrelas o ambiente criado pela autora a base do comboio e das casas que a protagonista  admirava  foi bastante giro  eu gostei bastante disso as personagens tambem foram todas bem criadas a parte disso  nao acho que tenha gostado tanto como toda a gente  talvez por nao estar no melhor mood de leitura ou as expectativas serem muito altas mas nao achei tao arrebatador quanto isso  spoilers o facto do thriller se basear na relacao da megan e do tom nao me  caiu muito bem   i mean  aquilo surgiu basicamente do nada e talvez por isso seja considerado imprevisivel  nao ha  ao longo do livro  qualquer pista para uma possivel relacao de ambos  ela nao estava interessada no kamal  se nao estou em erro no nome   entao  de onde surgiu o tom  spoilers  Paula Hawkins isn t an author I have read  The book was bought for me at Christmas for its reviews of being a bestselling thriller  I got the hardback edition with black binding and it felt and looked the part  At first it was slow  I started reading around mid afternoon  and by 5 o clock I was half way through the book and completely engaged  I read the whole book by 11pm and couldn t put it down  I found that the descriptions of people  places and timelines were so detailed I could have been part of the story  and it could have been real life  The book is written in an almost diary from taking you along the timelines of Megan  Anna and Rachel  with their lives intertwining at points throughout the book  But it s not until the very end that you really find out how all of these stories work together  Personally I would say this is a mild thriller  it is no Stephen King  but it isn t trying to be  It s a relatively easy read which is why I was able to finish it so quickly  The only thing I wish this book had more of was an ending  it feel quite abrupt which I wasn t expecting  But that fact in no way changes my attitude towards this book  A thoroughly enjoyable read  that is highly recommended  and rightly so  Live Love Laugh FPhttps   youbyyou wordpress com    FOR MORE REVIEWS AND BLOGS  This is the kind of thriller which sits among the other prominent pieces of domestic noir like Gone Girl  and yet presents a different kind of suspense  It ll definitely keep you guessing and reading long into the night just so you can see how it all could possibly end  Though the  big reveal  is not as shocking as some I ve come across  the dawning realisation of it all actually makes a good fit for a story that creeps up on you as the pages keep turning  almost by themselves  The hype that has surrounded this novel for a long while now I feel is justified  so now I m looking for another thriller that will truly surprise me  I d seen this book on the shelf at my local Barnes   Noble many times and had even picked it up to read the interior book liner notes and found it to be high on my list of  want to read s and then I received a signed copy of the book for Christmas  I was enthusiastic  But I soon found myself knee deep in estrogen  Turns out all the POV s in the book are female  I m not saying this is bad  only unusual  Of course I d read books with a woman s POV before  Agatha Christie books come to mind  but this one had three POV s  all female  and it shifted from one to the other  At first I found it annoying  but there was something fascinating as well And then there was the shifting  For the most part it was chronological  but there was one POV  the victim s  that of course wasn t chronologically aligned with the others  It was  within itself chronological  but it played out on a separate timeline than the others But I have to admit the book was quite good  I found myself caught up with both the characters  all of whom are flawed in some way  and the style  I began to wonder how Ms Hawkins wrote the book  What I envisioned was her writing the story through from each POV and then breaking them up and interweaving them  As a writer myself  I found this most intriguing  Of course it s probably not how she did it at all  It s the way I would have done it  had I thought of it Bottom line is that this book is an excellent read  from characterizations and scene setting to include sensory cues  as well as plot  I would very much recommend it to anyone  even though it s decidedly told from a female perspective  Hmmmm  Let me start first by saying that I would definitely recommend this book  It s clever  the characters are well drawn  and the general premise is great  Having said that  here are my issues  1  the first quarter of the book is backstory and set up  Nothing really happens except that Rachel rides on a train and describes what she sees  2  I really didn t connect with any of the characters  I pitied or loathed them  3  does a born liar really come clean when he doesn t even need to  with little prompting  The murderer all of a sudden has the most honest moment of his life at the end of the book when he would most likely tell the biggest lie of his life  Whaaat  Not only does he spill  but it s a long retelling of every step that occurred leading to the murder  It didn t fit his character  4  readers are misled by the publisher that this is a novel with an unreliable narrator  The narrators are all reliable  They all tell their version of the story as it happened  The reader puts her own ideas  drunks can t be trusted  emotionally screwed up people can t be trusted  etc  into the characters  stories and that is not the definition of an unreliable narrator  Having said all of that  I still think it was an enjoyable read  Okay  so it s not LITERATURE writ large  but with three unreliable female narrators  this whodunit had me riveted to the story  I can t remember when I last finished a book in less than 24 hours     I liked this book  Right from the start  I was fascinated by Rachel s inner voice and her take on things around her   absolutely cringeworthy  Some people claim they saw the ending coming a mile off  but I didn t until three quarters of the way through and thought it was a really well developed plot  Loved the unreliable narrator s approach   trust no one  Finished the book in two days  I was pleasantly surprised by this book  I had no expectations for it but a bunch of the ladies I work with were reading it so I said why not  They all finished before me  however once you get into the book it s not hard to see why it was read so quickly  The storyline is fast paced and keeps you thinking  I would definitely recommend this book  4 5 starsall the twists are good  i just felt it s too long  tho  An edge of your seat thriller  I would have rated it 4 5 stars if that was possible  I did the audible version and the readers were very good   I don t usually do audible but my eyes needed a rest and my ears needed some good entertainment  Kind of Hitchcock intrigue  It is possible to dislike every character in a book and still be sucked in by great writing and a creative story  Every time I thought I had figures out  whodunnit  another wrinkle was thrown into the story and I was onto another trail  I d love it if female writers wrote strong female characters whose entire existence didn t revolve around men but  despite that  this is a good read  It s like the non feminist Gone Girl  You will read this book in 2 days  Hope it gets turned into a movie so I have faces to hate   won digital galley  can t wait to get started it is getting increasingly difficult for authors to surprise me with these types of novels  the whole  multiple narrators unraveling the story slowly through their individual story  told alternating chapter by chapter  this book was very good  it is a nail biter of a story  what happened to the missing woman  how is everyone involved  who did it  but not only that  the misery each of these women endured daily was sad  it gave them each a layered quality that kept my interest past the twisted plot and storytelling convention  the characters kept my interest  had back stories that led to their present situations well  great thrilling read Nice  well written mystery   I really enjoyed this book  It kept me turning its pages and really had me hooked  So many people say this is a dark book and  although I am not a big fan of murder stories  I didn t feel like it was as dark as much as it was a picture of someone trapped by alcoholism  others dealing with the consequences of infidelity  and the entangled relationships that develop because of both of these difficulties in life  The plot totally drew me in  the character development of these flawed people was great  I identified most with Cathy   the roommate trying not to be an enabler   and I found it hard to put down for a few days  WARNING  May contain slight spoilers Very nicely written  intriguing book  The style is very believable  the amount of detail somehow familiar and the trains of thought very realistic  Oh  but there are some awful people in this book  First and foremost our main character Rachel  She is just so frustratingly weak and pathetic  that I seriously did not feel bad when bad things befell her  I was not on her side  Just thinking about it now makes me roll my eyes at her stupidity  Other people in this book though  are also awful  Some more subtlety so but it s still there  the greed  the lies  Oh god the lies  Seriously  EVERYONE in this book lies  About everything  And for stupid reasons  They are dishonest and unfaithful and suspicious and vindictive and overall terrible people  but for the most part that s hidden behind their every day lives It kind of makes me sad to think that this is what people like in real life  I know this is what some people are like  but I don t want a lot of people to be like this  not the majority  It s just so depressing  Anyway The book is certainly gripping  I became so obsessed with finding out what had happened on that Saturday night  and I was so angry at Rachel for being a stupid drunk and not remembering  I really didn t know who to suspect at first  I even suspected Rachel at some point  but it became more obvious towards the end  there were no other characters left  And then you get that inevitable going through the process of it all coming out  I thought to Rachel  be smart   but was she smart  No  The only time she shows some backbone is at the very end of the book  About time It was certainly a well thought out and exciting read  Not really thriller to me  more like suspense  But still  as I said  gripping  Would recommend  Without further a do  let s get straight to the point The main protagonist took an awful lot of time to take a grasp on the reality  I would have given it 5 stars had it not been this frustrating for the major portion of the book  But I got to admit that it was unpredictable  I didn t have any suspicion towards the culprit until the end I loved that NONE of the characters were goody too shoes  Everyone had a darker past and a motive to murder  I loved the creepiness and the darker thoughts  The whole setting had a eerie feeling and I enjoyed that immensely   view spoiler  But oh my God Megan  How can anyone be THIS stupid  How did she manage to kill her daughter by falling asleep in the bathtub  I can t even   hide spoiler  Overall  a must read if you re into thriller and darker themed books  I haven t read Gone Girl yet  I tried it once and DNFed it after a couple of pages  so I don t know about the similarities   If you insist on comparing a book to another one  state your reasoning  I have grown so tired of seeing books compared to GONE GIRL   I hope that Gillian Flynn feels the same way  THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN only needs that  blurb  to get people to actually buy it    and once they begin reading they are in for a treat  Hawkins has created a main character that is riddled with problems and you really should not care about   yet you have to find out what happens   the ONLY reason to drop GONE GIRL into any commentary review   This is the perfect book to read on a Sunday when you have nothing else to do  Once you start reading  you just find yourself engrossed and cannot put the book down until finished  Under the right director  this book will make a great movie if cast properly I saw the Hitchcock film playing in my mind as I read  This is a very impressive debut  I hope that she can continue the good work  This was a fun  creepy read  I really enjoyed the unreliable narrator Rachel  Her drinking and destructive actions added to the thrill of the book because it made me feel out of control  Usually I can predict what is going to happen next  but Rachel s behavior was so bizarre that I never knew what she was going to do  and that led to a feeling of delicious tension  I also didn t guess the twist ending  and I always enjoy when a story manages to surprise me  This will be a tough book to follow  Some clever surprises   This is one of the better psychological thrillers I have read  The many twists and turns in the plot kept me guessing  and only at the very end did I figure out who the guilty party was   First of all  it was so good I read the whole thing in three days  and that happens about NEVER anymore  Second  I didn t figure it out until 60 pages from the end  and only then because Hawkins let me figure it out  This thriller deserves the hype  read it  Oh this was a good read  I was skeptical going in because I didn t love the writing at first  and there is so much hype about the book that I naturally went in with my guard up  About 120 pages in  though  I started listening to the audiobook  and the experience improved so much  and the story was so good  All of the characters were so interesting  I was particularly drawn to Megan  I felt like I was able to sympathize with almost every character  even though they were all very flawed people  That s a win in my book  I wanted to read this the minute I saw it  I couldn t find a paper copy anywhere so bought the ebook  It is a nice deception  You know there is more going on than the author is letting you know  but figuring out the villian s  is a challenge  It had me hooked from start to finish  but there is a but  it isn t perfectly written  it has some clunky bits  but these are easily forgiven because the story is different  it moves along really fast and the characters are all sufficiently flawed to make you squirm  Blimmin good read  Great suspenseful murder mystery   Anna the   girl on the train  an alcoholic   who is determined to solve who killed Megan  Even though she didn t know her   But as the story unfolds   she realizes they had common thread    Great read    Its a holiday book  I enjoyed reading it  This is not the type of book that I would normally read but I m so glad that I did  A psychological thriller that has already drawn comparisons to Gone Girl  I was immediately intrigued by the storyline  Simply put  a woman named Rachel rides the train every day and creates stories about the lives of the people whose homes she passes  One couple in particular that she fixates on  who she has named Jess and Jason  seem to have the perfect life  Until one day she notices that Jess appears to be having an affair  And the next day it is revealed that the woman has gone missing  It is not enough for Rachel to be an outside observer  she inserts herself into their lives and this has dramatic results  The book is told from three perspectives  but Rachel  the main narrator  is completely unreliable and I found that this added even more to the suspense  This is a compulsive read and although I figured out the  whodunit  with about 100 pages left I still needed to know how it would end   Foi o meu primeiro triller e confesso k nao e bem o meu genero  mas   reconheco que a autora narra de uma forma q nos impede o abandono da leitura  No decorrer da historia  simplesmente leva nos a intuir k o culpado pode ser qualquer um dos personagens e fico espantada qd efetivamente descubro o culpado  Um genero diferente k gostei de ler para fugir um bocado aos meus habituais romances     A nice  quick read  I wouldn t call this book a nail biter  but Ms  Hawkins does enough with character revelation to keep the reader interested  I wasn t completely surprised by the revelation of the murderer  but Ms  Hawkins threw in a great twist I did not see coming Ms  Hawkins writes believably of the loneliness that we all feel and of the truth that we irresistibly create fantasies for ourselves about ourselves and about others  often to the point of putting ourselves in danger as a result  Four stars  Yeah  I guessed the ending    and I was still impressed by how good it was   Got this book in the mail today  Finished it in less than 12 hours  Took breaks to take care of my kids   then sat down and finished it all  I had no idea what was going to happen      It blew me away  I loved it  Highly recommend   The four stars is purely because I never saw the end coming  But that could just be me  many of those who read the book might guess it much earlier than me  So depending upon whether you fit into the slightly slow guessing category or the criminally smart guessing category you might enjoy or get bored with the book  The similarities between this storyline and Gone Girl is just too much at certain points  With obviously and intentionally strewn plot points I kept on suspecting all the main characters in turn  Not everyone s life is as dreamy as you imagine it to be  Sometimes the truth that is staring at your face is not the real truth  Sometimes you just can t ignore your past  A Girl goes missing  a Girl on the train has something to say and another Girl who could have been just a passerby drags herself back into the story  Go guess who is who   I liked it  At least I think I liked it I read a good book today  My problem is that it felt like I was reading it through a mentally ill  alcoholic fog   SPOILER  This is the first book I read where every single person was mentally ill  a drunk  a psychotic  or an unethical enabler  It is very difficult to read a book written in part by the ramblings of a drunk   the next voice was the scattered thinking of a bi polar burn out and the the third voice was of a passive aggressive adulterer  I really mean it  not even the psychiatrist was totally sane  If you can wade through all that  you will probably like this book  But the author gives away the ending on page 245 with one line and 90 more pages to slog through  Oh well we can t all be 5 star writers with every book  This was a good book  not a re read book  It s not a best o f 2015 book  It s just a stand on its own good book   I would say it was just an ok book but people reading my book critiques are getting snarky with me  Apparently they take exception to book reviews they don t agree with  And all this time I thought they wanted my opinion  silly me  I did mention it was a good book right  This was a really interesting read  It dips in to the lives of various characters   with really fantastic insight  The main focus is on Rachel  she takes the exact same commuter train every single morning  It rattles down the tracks  past piles of old clothes  dirt and various houses  But from all the houses it passes the one that get s Rachael s undivided attention every single day is the one where   Jess and Jason   lives  The couple intrigue Rachael  they fascinate her like no other  Then one morning as the train passes the house  Rachael sees something  it s only for a split second and the train is pass  but it s enough to make Rachael go to the police  but has this caused more harm than good Fast paced and a nice even flow are the first things I have to say about this read  it moved from point a to b at a really good pace  none of that stop start that is found in so many similar reads  that my dear reading friends drive me crazy  I really loved the mystery in this book  but sadly I figured it out too quickly and I felt a little cheated that I was able to get it so fast  Now that we have that out of the way I can tell you all about the most amazing part of this read  the unrealiable narrator   man it drove me crazy at first but then suddenly it all just became clear and it was like some kind of high to try and outsmart the narrator  To sum it up   this is a terrific read for any reader that loves a great mystery  lots of emotional drama and loads of guessing if you don t pay attention  Don t start reading this one if it s late at night   because after the third chapter it really grips the reader 4 5 star review   Rolling past the image that changes her life   This was a story full of twists and turns right up to the ending   I definitely see why everyone was raving so much about this book  I was pleasantly surprised with how the book went because I went into it with zero expectations  The setting was fun  as it was in an English neighborhood and I liked the repetitive nature of the trains  What really got me was the plot twist  I think it was well done and I did not see it coming at all  which I enjoyed  My only complaint was the ending  I did not like how it tied things up and wished that it wasn t as rushed as it was  Lesson Learned Don t be an alcoholic  Not because its unhealthy  but because it makes you forget things  Noted     This is what happens when you re bus   as so many women are  The perfect book through which to view base human flaws  without dirtying your own hands  and know how much fun it is to be a fly on a wall  Human characters  without pretense  well  you ll know what I mean   who find themselves in real situations and for whom the outcomes have dire consequences  It s really great to feel relieved at the outcome   or can you  gostei muito deste livro pela sua diferenca em relacao aos thrillers psicologicos que tenho vindo a ler  E viciante  envolvente   atrevo me mesmo a chama lo de  tresloucado     Recomendo a sua leitura  If you like  Gone Girl  this is a book for you  Multiple viewpoints  a murder to be solved  and plot twists aplenty   I think the most fascinating thing about this book is that the narrator  the main one  is an alcoholic who is spiralling down  It doesn t make her likable at all   but it gives you a look into the mind of an addict struggling in her own suffering and trying to get out  Its written more like Gone Girl   more screenplay than literature but a really good story and characters who are really much more messed up than the average person but  I think her point is that you really don t know much about that  average  person on the train or in the street   Un ottimo thriller psicologico  Non mi aspettavo davvero questo livello di coinvolgimento  ansia e dubbio che invece mi ha trasmesso La ragazza del treno  La Hawkins e bravissima a creare una protagonista inaffidabile  nella quale il lettore non puo credere eppure vorrebbe credere  Ti porta a dubitare di tutti  di qualsiasi persona tranne che del vero colpevole e quando alla fine esce fuori il tutto tiene perfettamente le redini della trama con una spiegazione impeccabile  cosa che a volte in alcuni thriller appare futile e banale   Consigliatissimo  This definitely deserves the comparisons to Gone Girl that it s been receiving  Alcoholic  down on her luck Rachel whiles away her days by people watching on the train and browsing the internet at her local public library  When a woman who she s been watching from afar goes missing  Rachel knows that she has to do something  tell somebody that she s been keeping tabs on her  has seen things that aren t normal  This is a good mystery  one with mystery that slowly unravels  The altering narration works well for this story   giving us just enough to put the whole story together piece by piece  I did find that the pacing lagged in a few places  but the last quarter picks up  starts racing  and sprints through to the end  I liked this   didn t particularly care for the characters  but I ve found that with mysteries  especially dark gritty ones  that doesn t matter so much to me  I want the mystery to be engaging and twisty  something slippery that I really need to hold on to to figure out  Definitely a book I would recommend to fans of Gillian Flynn and Tana French   Andrea Fantastic story telling  This author keeps you guessing right up until the end  I kinda figured out who killed who  but still second guessed myself  I would have given it 5 Stars  but kept having to scroll back and forth with the dates constantly changing  Became easier to read about halfway through  I m a  drink my red wine at night  kind of girl  I can honestly say that after reading this book I don t crave that evening drink  Rachel s repeated drunken stupor will have you not wanting to EVER be that bad  Great book for those of us that enjoy drinking  but don t have to have it  Paula Hawkins did an outstanding job making you feel sorry for Rachel  Quite simply  this book rocks  I went in expecting a scary  psychological thriller  and was disappointed on that front  It is less of a  thriller  and far more a psychological delving into absolutely terrible people s minds  Yes  all of the characters are absolutely TERRIBLE people  You will not like ANY of them  all  The primary story driving character  Rachel  is a horrid drunk whose insights you get about a missing persons case  However  the story that the characters are getting through is interesting enough that you will want to keep flipping through the pages of the book  It gets a bit tedious around the middle when you become absolutely convinced of who dun it  but KEEP GOING  There is 50  of the book left for a reason SPOILERS FOLLOW   The author s greatest feat was throwing the reader for a loop by making you distrust and dislike Rachel so much towards the middle of the novel  She was a drunk  she couldn t help herself with anything  she was a liar  she took advantage of people  she was a creep towards her ex husband  she needed to stop meddling    and she was abusive towards her ex to boot  All signs point to her being the absolute worst  and I m sure that every reader is like me and becomes absolutely convinced that Rachel was the murderer all along  The twist seems to be so easy to spot     but you are thrown for a loop I will say that the end was kind of terribly executed  Tom s switch didn t seem altogether believable  and yet I m totally okay with it  I m glad Rachel wasn t the one to do it  and I hope she makes it to a month sober  And damn  I hope she gets out of Cathy s place because I feel the most for poor Cath  And FUCK ANNA  She s the worst  4 5 stars   I finished it within 24 hours because it was really a fast paced read  The characters were remarkably annoying which made the book very effective  And I did find out whodunnit even before it was revealed  But I can say that was a tough case because of minimal or unseen clues  Over all it was a fun and twisted story     If you enjoyed Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn you ll love this book too  Everyone s talking about this book  don t let them ruin the twist  I Read it in one day  an easy read but enjoyable book which will keep you guessing until the end  This was a pretty decent read which captivated and thrilled me for the most part  Despite the formulaic and somewhat predictable final act the book is a fine example of a crisp  quick paced and fluid narrative  The small number of characters and sub plots that connected well with the main plot made  The Girl on The Train  a breezy and mostly exciting read  My only issue with the book was that it at times relied on convenient twists to move the plot forward  Also the book does seem inspired by some recent thrillers like Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl  All things said and done I enjoyed The Girl on The Train  No doubt it is melodramatic and seems like a movie s screenplay but the story certainly grips and entertains  It is a well written book that serves its purpose   Received through Goodreads Firstreads  Thank you so much  I loved it I devoured The Girl On The Train It was incredible  so addictive   I found myself picking it up every chance I had  The characters  despite their obvious flaws  as  people   not the writing of them   are highly lovable and perhaps because of that  very relatable  The plot is full of twists and turns and takes on very unique narrative vantage points  Keeps you guessing to the end Fantasic  loved it  Bijzonder verhaal  De eerste helft van het boek leek me een oude stoomtrein die in gang moest getrokken worden  de tweede helft daarentegen was een sneltrein die niet meer zou stoppen tot wanneer het eindstation bereikt was In het begin kon ik niet in het verhaal komen  traag en eerder aan de saaie kant  echter op een bepaald moment raakte ik in de ban van het boek  Doorheen de verhalen van Rachel  Anna en Megan kwam de waarheid beetje bij beetje naar de oppervlakte  Het einde was dan ook een complete verrassing voor mij  Uiteindelijk dus een goed boek  maar je moet wel even doorbijten bij de start  Geef dit boek een knallende beginfase en dan zou het een topper geweest zijn  Jammer want dit kost Paula Hawkins toch een ster  Maar als debuut heeft ze wel haar stempel gedrukt   The book keeps you in suspense  There s a couple of twists characters are intriguing  As you read the book you release how psychological messed up all the characters are for different ways  When you think you know who killed the person and why the author makes you think it could be another character  In the end pretty much all of the characters could have done it   En riktigt otack bok  Vagade nastan inte lasa den om jag var hemma sjalv  Sargade manniskor och deras oden beskrivs levande  Man blir nyfiken pa personerna som portratteras och dras med i handlingen  Att det ar tag med i historien gor boken annu battre  sa klart  Alkoholmissbruk  arbetsloshet och misshandel ar standigt narvarande i boken  Intressant och levande  om an i laskigaste laget for min smak   l This book was quite interesting and one of a kind  I hadn t read a book mystery thriller in quite some time  This was refreshing and filled me quite a bit of anticipation to get back to reading whenever I couldn t  I rated it 4 starts instead of 5 because I have never imagined myself coming across a book where literally not one single character was likable  This however did add to the appeal and intrigue of the book  By the end of it I actually felt more sympathetic and somewhat liked some of the characters which was surprising  This book and its ending definitely takes you by surprise  It really shows that you can t judge a book by its cover  It was a great read that I recommend to anyone who enjoys reading a good novel  especially its out of the ordinary from your typical reading tastes   I was not sure about this book at first  I found the main character  Rachel  frustrating and irritating  At times  I wasn t even sure I wanted to finish it  However  I stuck with it and I m really glad As unlikable as Rachel is  I did feel compassion for her at times  so kudos to the author for that  I did have a suspicion of the killer at the beginning  but I think I was in that  suspecting everybody  stage of reading   view spoiler  I think I started figuring out everything at the time the author wanted it to happen  I was not shocked at finding out that Tom was the killer  but I was surprised that he had manipulated Rachel so much and was such a sociopath  I did not see that coming  and I usually do see twists  so that added to my enjoyment of the book   hide spoiler  If you like psychological thrillers  you will probably like this one  It s probably not the very best example of one  but it s definitely worth a read  Enjoyed it but felt it was a bit predictable I must admit  I have not read Gone Girl and I haven t seen the movie  so I wasn t looking for a comparison going in  I really liked this book  though parts were hard to deal with  it made me re examine re visit personal situations that weren t very pleasant  I did like that the characters seemed real and sometimes even very unlikeable  Very well written  I was afraid when I started reading  TGOTT  that it was going to be predictable b c of the comparisons to  Gone Girl   liked  but didn t want same book w  different characters   So I didn t have real big hopes of liking it  It starts out kind of slow  but I wasn t bored to tears so I kept going wondering where this was going to lead   Where as reading  GG   I almost stopped reading 50 pages into it because I was bored  Glad I didn t   When I got to around page 55  I noticed the dates of the entries were jumping back   forth over a six month period which I found confusing   annoying  However  when I started paying closer attention  I realized that Hawkins was probably doing this deliberately to keep the train of thought slightly muddled so that it may be harder to determine the outcome  I actually appreciate the technique now that I have finished the book The characters were realistic even though for the most part they were all unlikable  some more than others  but I think they were meant to be  Meaning  I probably wouldn t want any of them as a close friend  It could be repetitive   drag at times  but not enough to slow the reading or made me want to put it down I really like  TGOTT   I would definably recommend this book  As a matter of fact  I will have to go back   reread  at least certain entries again soon  soon so that I can see where I went wrong  When I got to the revelation   had to stop   think  Wow  she got me  I would love to elaborate  but I don t want to give away any spoilers  Once you read it though  you ll know what I m talking about  I was pleasantly surprised with the book as a whole  Don t give up on it  I could not put this book down  and that is high praise indeed  After I was finished with it  in an all night marathon reading   I began to think  Was the plot plausible  Were the characters realistic  Could any of the events truly happen in real life   I began to doubt my self  Perhaps the conductor of this train was taking me for a ride like a deceitful lover  And I enjoyed every minute of it  Rounding up to 4 stars for the lovely British accents  Last night I made the mistake of reading some Goodreads reviews and came across one without a spoiler alert  Thanks a lot for telling me whodunit      4 5 stars  really great thriller  full review to come I liked this one better than Gone Girl  but I still had the same problem with this one as I did with Gone Girl  I didn t like any of the characters  This one has some good twists and turns  though  and the train is a clever device  I didn t see the ending coming  and it was a good one  It s definitely compelling   I finished it quickly  and I won t be surprised if it s turned into a movie some day  Riveting  Taut  I really enjoyed this  the mystery  the perspectives  the twists  Highly recommend  could barely put it down  And in the time between when I put it down and could pick it up again  I mulled it over  Great example of how reality may be different from perception  and of how our lusts can be not just our downfall  but others  as well  I haven t read a book like this in a long time  One where I wasn t really attached to any of the characters  but I literally could not put it down  I couldn t wait to get back to it and see what happened next  It had me guessing for 3 4 s of the way  and after that I was still interested right up to the end  Good reading  This book sucked me in from the very beginning  As much as I found the mystery interesting  I was much more taken by Rachel and her sad  lonely existence  Every morning Rachel wakes up with a feeling of dread and tries to piece together what she did while drunk the night before  Her shame and self loathing are palpable and they put a knot in my stomach  The actual mystery was sort of secondary to me I guess  I quickly suspected how things were going to turn out so that part wasn t quite as exciting but I was totally taken in by the characters  as unlikable as they were  This suspenseful thriller could also be entitled  The Shadow People   because there was always someone lurking in the shadows and I never quite knew who was the lurker and who was the lurkee  I just made up that word   Rachel views her old neighborhood daily from the seat of the London commuter train  As she passes by  she grieves for her her former life and home now occupied by her ex  his second wife and their baby  She also dreams up scenarios about a couple in a house not far from her ex s  A mysterious disappearance sets things in motion  Twists and turns kept me guessing about the potential for good or evil in the main characters  This story gained momentum towards a powerful ending  I loved this book  I really really enjoyed it it was a bit slow in the beginning  but it got better It s a well woven and very interesting story about three women and how they re interconnected You don t see the end coming until you re almost at the end A great read and I d recommend to anyone who likes mystery and suspense   Apparently  this is Paula Hawkins first book of this genre  Very hard to believe as it s very awesome  I thought this book was great  It was intriguing from the very beginning  it caught your attention and never let go  I liked how it was told from different POV s and you never had an inkling of who took Megan  I liked Rachel as a character  she had real everyday problems and just got sucked into everything by harmlessly watching people from a train window  The reason I took one star away is because I got tired of reading about how fat and ugly Rachel was  it had no bearing on the story at all  It was interesting reading Anna s parts of the story to see Tom through her eyes but for her to constantly remind us of how much better she was than Rachel because Rachel was fat got a little old  I m not the first person to say this  and I certainly won t be the last  The Girl On the Train is this year s Gone Girl  A domestic noir  it has a similar premise  a story told from various perspectives    but instead of one unreliable narrator  it foists multiple ones on us  Regardless of how you feel about the denoeument    it s a little too deliberate and ingeniously constructed    you won t be able to put this book down  It s gripping  it s cinematic  it s a page turner that had me ignoring chores and ate up the better part of my Sunday  The premise  A girl on a train passes by the same house during her daily commute and  possessed of a vivid imagination  she dreams up a life for the couple who live there  That girl is Rachel  She s a self pitying wreck    unemployed  perpetually drunk and hung up over her ex husband  She s prone to blackouts and drunk dialing  She s needy and irrational  And she s the main narrator To her  the couple who live in the house possess the perfect relationship she once had    or  thinks  she once had  The others who keep the story moving along are Megan  the woman who lives in the house    complicated  manic  and with an outsized secret that s eating away at her  and Anna  who s now married to Rachel s ex    passive  oblivious and desperate to build a drama free life for her and her family When Megan goes missing  the lives of the three women intersect in strange and arresting ways  Saying any more would spoil the many surprises Hawkins has packed into the book Don t go into The Girl on the Train expecting great writing  No one ever should when it comes to thrillers  But Hawkins  a journalist by training  has pacing down pat  She does a beautiful job of withholding key pieces of information  drip feeding them to us at just the right moments  She switches narrators right when tensions climax  And like the train  she keeps the story barrelling along   I read this book months ago and totally forgot to do a review  Shame on me  But the book was so good to the point where months can go by and I still remember exactly how the book made me feel and why I liked it so much Surprisingly enough  this might be my favorite book of the year  And not necessarily because the book lived up to the hype  but because of the way the book made me feel while reading it  I realize that the book s  evil twin  is Gone Girl  But  I didn t think of Gone Girl at all while reading this  The book stood alone in my mind  which I recommend trying while reading Now  I m not a huge fan of multiple POV s type reads  The plot can get messy and parts of the book can become cloudy  It s easy to hate characters when their POV comes up then goes away  But with this book    I didn t feel that way  Actually  I was reluctant to even start the book because it was such a popular book and I hate hype  loathe is probably a more appropriate word   Nothing EVER lives up to its hype    ever  So I was about to just return it to the library and convince myself it s the book  not me Additionally  I read the reviews on Goodreads reviews prior to reading  not always the best idea either  and a lot of people were saying that the book is incredibly slow and has an unremarkable ending that falls completely flat  I have to disagree completely  I was hanging on each character s every word and phrase  I was so intrigued with each character and how their voice contributed to the overarching story  The story was surprisingly dense  The characters were unlikable  yes  But the way the author constructed the character s interactions was seamless  I was absolutely sucked into their sick  obscure and whiny lives  The book practically read like a movie  I vividly imagined everything each character experienced  scene by scene  The author successfully set the scene and tone through the voice of each character  Quite frankly  I would have enjoyed a male POV  and you would understand why after reading the entire novel   That would have opened a completely different perspective and changed the flow of dialogue The ending was great in my opinion  I never saw it coming  Once everything played out and everyone s POV timeline lined up  I binged to the end  This is probably one I wouldn t mind reading again in book form rather than ebook  And that s saying a lot because I am not a re reader  It would probably benefit me to re read it because I read it so quickly due to its  thriller  qualities and I m sure I missed some things  I would definitely read much slower the second time around and really absorb what is happening around each character I kinda hate that I even remotely liked this book    because everyone liked this book  But I have to give credit where credit is due  This book is a good one  I found  The Girl on the Train  to be a very enjoyable read  This book had me constantly putting together different scenarios in my head of where the author was going and every time I was wrong  The suspense was just enough to keep me enthralled but not too over the top  Paula Hawkins creates an assortment of characters that are equally complex as they are unlikeable  I found the most difficult part of the book for me was that I didn t really like the characters and found myself not really caring what happened to them in the long run  I would definitely recommend this to others to read  It is fun  fast  interesting and entertaining  Not quite as good as Gone Girl but in the ball park  Keeps you guessing  well written  but it s NOT the next Gone Girl I read this for a book club  I wasn t sure if I would like it because the last two whodunit books I didn t like and figured out things before the end  This book was good  It wasn t amazing and most of the characters annoyed me  but it was very intriguing and I didn t really figure it out until it was brought to light  I suspected everyone at one point lol because I just figure if I do I will get it right eventually  but I didn t really truly believe that the person behind it was the one it was going to be  It was a quick read and I enjoyed it   We meet Rachel in chapter one and she s a bit of a mess  drinks too much and full of self pity  It seems the best part of her day is on the train to work in London and back home again  The train usually makes a short stop so she can see the house she once lived in with ex husband Tom  She misses him terribly and wants to get back with him but he s remarried and having none of it  During the train s pauses  she takes time to notice the couple who live just four houses away from her former home  She calls them Jason and Jess and is jealous of the life and love she imagines they have together  In chapter two we meet Megan  the woman who lives in a house next to the railway and is the person Rachel imagines to be Jess  She s married to Scott  aka Jason  who seems more interested in his business than his wife  Megan would like to have a lengthy vacation on some tropical paradise but that s not in the cards  Megan has a part time job as a nanny  taking care of Anna and Tom s baby  of the family living four homes away  Yep  Tom is THAT Tom  Rachel s former husband   Each chapter is marked with the name of the woman character who is narrating her story and a date  In Rachel s case the date is  current time  but for Megan  it s several months earlier  I wasn t confused by this technique for it serves to tell Megan s back story while Rachel tells her daily sad tale  So now the stage is set for something sinister to happen  And you know that somehow  some way  Rachel is going to inject herself into the lives of these people who live next to the railroad tracks  When she sees a strange man fondling Megan  Rachel believes she has justification to get involved  The story builds steadily and leads to a dramatic ending with all the loose ends neatly tied  The only negative in the book for me was the five major characters  Each one had significant defects  they were often irritating to read about  and it was hard to feel much sympathy for them  Great book especially for a debut  Lots of twists and turns  I did figure it out before the end  but it was still well put together and had me guessing for a long time   I heard a lot about this book  and requested it quite awhile ago  I got it this week and it only took me a few days to read it  Definitely a page turner I heard this book compared to Gone Girl  but honestly  I liked this book more  I thought the main three female characters were more complex than any of the characters in Gone Girl  I thought the writing was very good  and I liked how the central mysteries of the story revolved around missing memories in the main character  Rachel s  mind Overall  a satisfying thriller   Going into this book  I will admit I had very low expectations  It just seemed that it was one of those books that was harping on the popularity of Crime Fiction due to GONE GIRL by Gillian Flynn  However  I found myself devouring three quarters of this fantastic mystery crime in less then three hours I was engrossed into the characters and they destructive personalities  the ways in which they chose to deal with their own lives and relive awful pasts  I couldn t take my eyes off the the  who dun it    mystery  even better  until the last twenty pages I literally had no idea who had done it  The writing was intensely personal  to the point where I felt as though I was reading the diary of people that really existed in a tragic even I ve previously seen on the news Overall  and surprisingly to myself  I utterly loved this book  Makes me want to more Crime Fiction  4 5this was slow moving  ya ll  it was a good slow burn  when it did get fast  it got very fast paced  when it got overhyped  it got very overhyped  people say this is the next gone girl  but my body is still waiting on that thriller novel that can satisfy me the way that Gillian Flynn did  I don t think this is fair being compared to gone girl  but I really recommend it  the story takes a little effort to get into  but when you do  then you will really enjoy it   Take a rainy afternoon and read this thriller  I enjoyed the writing style and the way the stray is told by three different characters  Some are worse than others  but all are flawed  Add to your must read list   WHOA First of all  if anyone compares this book to Gone Girl in their pitch to you  DO NOT LISTEN  Sure  it s similar in the fact that it s an adult mystery thriller in which a woman goes missing  but if you read it looking for another Amy Dunne  you ll miss the story actually unfolding Parts of this story dragged for me  At times it felt very wash  rinse  repeat  Our main character rides the train  gets drunk  passes out  wakes up the next day and discovers approximately 348 phone calls from the various A holes in her life  and then she drinks some more  gets back on the train    on and on  Drink  pass out  repeat  I had mixed feelings about the truth of the mystery  It wasn t obvious from page one  and I did enjoy watching the characters put it together  But I didn t enjoy the way the book pointed you right at the answer a little bit before it was actually revealed  I felt like we knew for several chapters what had happened  but it kept being drawn out as the characters figured it out  I wished there had been one last twist  or at least that it had wrapped up a little quicker after it became obvious Overall  this was a gripping mystery that keeps you in the dark long enough to let you come up with your own theories  which made it very enjoyable  My top theory was incorrect  so I liked being surprised  I also really enjoyed how some of the scenes were very sneaky  and how a lot of the answers were there from the start  Even though the reveal came about more slowly than I wanted  it still amped me up  and ultimately left me satisfied  Napisala sam osvrt na knjigu na http   citajme com cyber bosanka 1512    Well   for the first hslf of the book  I was a confusion  i kept rereading parts of chapters trying to keep the chsracters and the plot straight  Normally  I would not have had this amount of patience but something kept nsgging at me and telling me not to give up   and I had not even read any of the Goodreads reviews  I m glad I stuck with it  but was more like a rollrr cosster ride than a train ride No spoilers here but it s suspensful with less than honorable characters that you find yourself thinking quite dispicable but rooting  for some of them  despite yourself  I listened to  The Girl on the Train   by Paula Hawkins as I have been repeatedly told to give it a try  Set in the London suburban outskirts  and propelled through the story by way of a commuter train  this psychological thriller jumps forwards and backwards  interspersing points of view  Three women tell one story   a whodunit  Rachel is the broken woman on the train who is forced to roll by her old life every day  She s an alcoholic and still obsessing on her ex husband Anna is the young wife and mother who stole herself a husband  and now misses her days as a mistress  Megan is the seemingly perfect wife on the balcony with the carefree appearance and the handsome husband  but she hides secrets and yearns to run away  It was a fresh story  quite a feat in the age of  Gone Girl   with remarkable pacing and tension  but also an amazing audiobook with fantastic narrators I highly recommend the story  and will add   listen to it if you can As far as debut authors go  Paula Hawkins is one to watch  This was the first book I ve read in awhile that made me really excited about reading  I mean the kind of excited where I went home from work  made dinner and then just read until I fell asleep  late  because I wanted to stay up reading   This book was fantastic   Hawkins does an incredible job of creating suspense  of building the characters  of keeping you guessing  I went back and forth between my thoughts on Rachel  the main character  but that just made it more interesting to read   I genuinely wanted to know what had happened and I found myself actually getting angry at her for not remembering  That love hate relationship with her was what I found pushed the story forward Read this book if  You enjoyed Gone Girl You re a sucker for a good suspense thriller You re looking for an intense  enjoyable book to devour in one setting I was recommended this book by a friend and am glad I read it  I would class it as Gillian Flynn meets Emily Barr  The unusual main character being an alcoholic who experiences black holes in her memory works well and brings everything into question  What s real and what s up for debate  I kind of guessed about 70  through the novel who the villain was  but it didn t detract from my enjoyment of this excellent thriller  There were a few pretty good red herrings along the way and some very disturbing characters who would easily have fitted the bill  The protagonist  Rachel s self loathing and her history as a woman scorned and her stalker like tendencies  as well as her finding solace in alcohol all make for a gripping read  That  combined with an ex who is understanding  an ex s new wife who is overwrought and demanding  as well as protective of her child ensure the reader gets pulled into the tangled web which is Rachel s life  The daily train journey which she makes and the fantasies Rachel builds in her head on viewing occupants of the houses she sees on that journey are the basis for the story  Those fantasies and the realities of course differ dramatically  Rachel involves herself directly with the occupants of some of those houses with life changing results  Would definitely recommend and will happily read the next book by this author  I really liked this thriller book  it gets more intense as you keep reading and has a good plot and story  in spite of the fact that I already  knew  who was the guilty one even before reaching the middle of the book but that maybe it s just because of my unsettling and instinctive mind that always look for clues on places people that people often tend to forget about  A thriller it is  Three young women  Rachel  Megan and Anne  deal with their pasts and their relationships in three different ways  Each one of them has a story to tell when detectives must try to solve the case of a missing member of this group Rachel commutes on the train twice a day to London and passes the homes of Anne and Megan  witnessing their happiness  she was denied  Her alcoholism prevents her from thinking rationally  It results in her being declared an unreliable witness to the police  Apart from obsessively looking out the window of the train onto the other two women s houses  she was also once an inhabitant of the same street  before her life was turned upside down and her marriage went up in an adultery haze  Rachel has flashbacks of events which confuses her  and the police are not in a hurry to believe anything she says when she tries to explain what she witnessed and experienced I am not caught up in the hype around the Gone Girl craze  since I have not read the book yet  and won t do so soon   by choice  I m judging this book  The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  on its own merit and it is passing with flying colors as a  psychological  thriller  An excellent one  And a very well written debut novel to boot  The ending was a bit drawn out for my taste  but it doesn t cause the story to be less dramatic or enthralling  I have read similar books that was even better  but they somehow have all slit through the grid of attention  I identified the culprit since the first appearance of his name in the book  and that s not a good sign  I actually prefer to be proven wrong      Although I must add that the unexpected denouement caught me totally off guard and had me catching my breath in surprise If you are in the mood for a really good thriller  or a whodunit  this will be a superb choice  A riveting tale of dysfunction covered by a pretentious roof of happiness  What an enjoyable read   I am a  lightweight   I get freaked out easily and psycho thrillers usually disturb me to the point of losing sleep  The Girl on the Train was a good match for me  I thought Hawkins wrote a great debut novel  I liked the varying viewpoints and the gloomy mood  I couldn t put it down  waking up and telling my family over breakfast that I had to find out who the killer was in my book  I wasn t disturbed  just impressed with a psychologically thrilling tale that kept me on the edge of my seat until the end  This was a 5 star read for me up until the end which seemed to labor on in such a way that made me a bit impatient  Overall  a really great read  I had this book on my tablet for months without touching it despite all the praise and recommendations  I wanted to read it but just never got to it so I finally decided to make it my first book of 2016  The Girl on the Train is definitely similar to Gone Girl in several ways  One is how quick of a read it is and how easily engrossed I became with it  Another is the obvious  the twists the story takes and the reveals that happen throughout  Then there s the fact that in both books  I didn t particular like any of the characters while still enjoying the book  Hawkins did a really good job with this story and she kept me guessing  not all the way to the end  I don t remember the exact moment I figured it out  but it was before the reveal in the narrative  but long enough  I found myself looking for clues so I could figure out everything on my own  While I did figure out the major plot point  there were details revealed that still surprised me  and I was glad for that  I don t like predictability in mysteries and I appreciated that this wasn t like that at all One other thing to note is that I liked that each of our three narratives were not only all unreliable for various reasons but also that they were each distinct in voice  That s something I look for when I m reading a book that has multiple points of view  and I think that Hawkins did really well with that Overall  I m glad I read this and I enjoyed it and was glad for the suspenseful  twisting ride the book took me on  Muy buen libro  Engancha desde la primera pagina  y es muy recomendable   The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a fictional story and wasn t what I had expected it to be  Three different narrator stories merge into one large conflict  The main narrator  Rachel  is an alcoholic and an unconventional hero  The second narrator introduced  Anna  has a seemingly good at home life  the final narrator Megan it made out to seem like she has the desired life  Soon everything that is portrayed by these characters is shown to be untrue  The story is well written and all loose ends are brought together in the end as wanted in a book  However  some things the main character  Rachel  does may make you aggravated  She at times makes such stupid decisions you may want to yell at her  Other than this there isn t much bad about the book  There are surprises and plot twists and there is a mystery factor that makes you want to continue reading  In my opinion the book is worth a read  and someone who enjoys a mystery or a character with a lot of challenges would enjoy this book  Loved it  It was an easy fast read because I wanted to know what happened and who did it   This book is a compelling  can t put down read  Paula Hawkins deserves all the success this book brought  I didn t intend to read this book in the first place  There was a customer at my work that left it after finishing and responded very positively on it  And it also happened so that I had to take a long train ride just the following morning  so  perfect condition  The narration is thrilling  I was struggling to put the book aside  I finished it just while being on the train   there and back  If you have the same problem as me   I can t continue reading a book if the beginning is not exciting   then this is a total saviour  I love reading  but lately couldn t find a proper book  And this was it  out of nowhere  so unexpected The story is super depressing indeed  I could project some of its parts to my life and even found answers to my own problems  so to me it was even inspiring in a way  In a certain way  I was quiet shocked about the ending  so I may not be a Sherlock  but I don t think that the outcome is that obvious A really nice book  gave me back the taste to reading  It started a little slowly  with a pitiful and depressing character  It jumps from the perspective of one character to another s and jumps a bit in time  Once I figured that out  I was hooked  It was a great  thrilling read  I went into this thinking it would be more of a mystery novel  with a focus on finding clues and solving a puzzle  but it s definitely a thriller  It s fast paced and filled with twists that make it a hard book to put down  I liked the use of three different narrators in theory  but I don t think it was very effective  Rachel and Megan s voices were too similar  and Anna s sections made her more of a stereotype than a character  Still  this was an engrossing read with an interesting premise  Honestly  I don t even know if I liked this book or not  but I could NOT put it down  I turned pages so fast  I seem to be alone in my love of unlikable characters  but these folks were all terrible  and I couldn t get enough of it  At a few points  the story did seem to sag  but I was so eager to know what happened that I quickly plowed on  I found this a very satisfying read and I m glad I finally got around to it  Solidly good thriller  I enjoyed piecing this together with the character   even if it at times was as difficult for the reader to separate fact from illusion as it was for Rachel  Well written  tightly structured    just a good fun read I liked it  Did not at all think it was like GONE GIRL    I guess there s GIRL in the title   shrug  Maybe the comparison comes from unlikeable characters   shrug again  But  I did like it  The not knowing and trusting that comes with relationships  the alcoholism  although that went on a little longer than I d like   But Paula did an incredible job  I d recommend it  No sabia que esperarme de este libro despues de todas las opiniones que habia leido  pero la verdad es que me ha gustado mas de lo que esperaba  Al principio la lectura se me ha hecho un tanto pesada  pero ha sido pasar la mitad y no poder parar de leer Resena completa en mi blog  http   los mundos de caroline blogspo    Rachael is The Girl on the Train  She is an alcoholic  grieving about being childless  obsessing over and harassing her former husband Tom and his new wife Annie with late night  drunken phone calls  She fantasizes about a couple whose house she passes every day on the train  In her fantasy they are perfectly happy Jess and Jason  In real life they are Megan and Scott  One day  she sees something that suggest they are not as happily married as she imagines  The next day  Megan goes missing and the suspense ramps up  The story was slow for me until that point  Some have compared the twisted infidelity and suspicious spouse to Gone Girl  I saw those similarities  I found the characters in The Girl on the Train much more sympathetic   not exactly likable but not despicable either  It took me awhile to figure out who did it  The author used a device of referring to a character as just him he  implying it was one character when it might be another  I found that very well done and it added to the suspense   Creepy and fast paced  Certain parts were reminiscent of  Rear Window   which gave it the Hitchcock feel  I couldn t put the book down  I can t wait to see the movie adaptation  Me ha pillado en una epoca lectora en que me costaba mucho concentrarme y pese a ello no he abandonado este libro  Destacaria sobre todo a su protagonista y pese a que hay elementos que no son novedad es una lectura que te mantiene leyendo la mar de ocupada   Woah  Intense  This book totally plays with your mind  Clever twists and turns makes it a real page tunerI struggled to connect with the main character  which meant although I wanted to keep reading  I didn t enjoy the book as much as I d hoped  I felt similarly about We Need To Talk About Kevin  Great book  challenging characters  Definitely worth a read   OMG what a book  I refuse to give it five stars  I did not like the characters  except maybe Abdic a little  but it was a good story  The story is about Rachel who is divorced  a drunk  unemployed and just out of it really  Everyday she takes the same train to and fro the city and during these journeys she always watches out for a couple who live along the way  She fantasizes about them and I think she sees in them what she wish she had  One day something horrible happens  it coincides with something Rachel saw at the couple s place  add to that her almost constant drunken state and everything goes haywire  The story is told from three POV  Rachel s  Anne s and Meagan s  And all three ladies are sick really  I could not relate to any of them and honestly would not like to know any of them  The story flowed well and it kept me interested all the way to the end  The author is good  I feel it would be unfair to give lower than four stars  But I did not like it enough for five either lol   It s a very sad story  the right word is  depressing  Although I m not a fan of this kind of story  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book  it s well written and kept me involved And no  I didn t read  Gone Girl  so I can t say if they are similar It reminds me a little bit the book by Elizabeth Haynes  Into the Darkest Corner   This was a book club book  I couldn t put it down  Wow Don t read anything about it just read the book  Not at all a GONE GIRL copy  Just a good old whodunit  A page turner  Can t wait for the movie   I do not think this book is a great piece of literature  I don t think it has enough discussion points to work for a book club  There was nothing to highlight and read again  BUT it was wonderful escapist reading and sometimes that s just what I need  There was a compelling narrative which kept me going back for more  It s not a book that I was willing to let lie untouched for more than a few hours   a luxury of the retired  Every book that even resembles a psychological thriller has to be compared to Gone Girl so let me say that for me they were about equal  There was a little more suspense in GG but the ending was better on the train  The two main female narrators are quite unreliable  especially Rachel who drinks an incredible amount of alcohol  Anna s shallowness verged on the absurd  Yet  somehow she redeemed herself a little at the end  Tom  the main man  was interesting only as a plot tool  pun intended  to let us gain insights into the girls  I never liked his attitude but can t say much as I don t want to spoil anyone s plot  It s worth reading as long as your expectations are properly set  I gave it a 4 for its genre  It certainly isn t a 4 compared to a piece of literary fiction that someone like Peter Heller would write   J avais hate de lire le ce roman qui a suscite tant d engouement et je ne suis pas decue  C est bien ecrit  tres oppressant et assez addictif quand meme  La fin ne m a pas tellement surprise  mais tout au long du livre  je me suis possee des questions  j ai revu mes theories   C est un peu etrange d avoir pour personnage principal une alcoolique tres depressive  mais on voit l interet assez rapidement  Bref  j ai aime  D  Well this was the first book of 2016 for me  After going by the reviews shared by readers I decided to start my year with this book and I must say I am not disappointed Paula Hawkins certainly knows how to engage readers and build suspense What I like most about this one is the style of narration  The way most of the story is covered while traveling on the train by the main protagonist it was easy for me to relate with the characters as I used to take metro for work as well The only thing which could have been better was the ending   I thought it was a bit overstretched having said that I do feel that this is a great suspense thriller and a must read   Being touted as this years  Gone Girl  and as much as I liked Gone Girl  I think readers will be more even more engaged with this book  Good writing  for a debut thriller  great writing   interesting scenarios  Engrossing  I was really impressed overall  I found the main character easy to relate too  not so much in how she reacted to her circumstances  but how she felt about what she d been through  I finished it last night and haven t stopped thinking about it today  Definitely worth reading   HOLY CRAP    Totaly worth the monotonous middle bits Disclaimer  people keep comparing this to Gone Girl  Obviously this is not as good as Gone Girl  Why is that even a question    Since the one with the tattoo we ve had lots of girls pop up in titles but  like Salander  they re not actually girls  Books used to be called  The Woman In White  so why are they now jumping on the  girl  bandwagon or should that be train  Gone Girl  Girl Friday  Hard Girls  etc have a patronising  exploitative angle that doesn t sit well with me  Rant over  this book is a suspenseful story in the style of Strangers on a Train  The Lady Vanishes or some other Hitchcockian yarn  It certainly grips  compelling the reader to keep the pages turning Unreliable narrator Rachel is the unusual central character  Different in that she s relatively unattractive  a little overweight  depressed  unemployed and an alcoholic  perhaps more real than many a lead then  The other two women  Megan and Anna  have their own problems  the cause and results of which merge with Rachel s as the stories come together  Rachel still bothers her ex which in turn bothers his new partner  Bordering on a stalker she had unlikable qualities and yet I liked her  Her vulnerability and neurosis make her intriguing  and her behaviour entertaining  just so long as you don t have to live with her  It s a good ploy to have her make up the lives of the couple she watches from the train  Then  when Megan goes missing  she has info for the police  info that they  and the reader  doubt to be true  Clever  The book s perspectives and timescales constantly shift and the novel s strength is in its telling  Domestic noir and poisonous relationships are filling the shelves at the moment  Not sure I like the trend but this is a good example of the subgenre  Hawkins manipulates the reader with skill in a novel populated by dark secrets and selfish characters  I knocked a star off for the convenient  returning memory  after blackout  Oh and the title  I actually enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I was going to  The characters are all pretty messed up  The three females that tell the story all have problems  and the males are certainly not out done on that front  I can t make my mind up as to whether the characters are cliche are not  but I don t think it matters  It delivered a very fast read with heart pounding moments and a great ending  even though I worked it out   Overall I d say to read this book if you re in the mood for a psychological thriller with a slightly different format   The book is split into little Morning and Evening sections    This was a very enjoyable read  I saw it advertised with the slogan  if you liked Gone Girl you ll love this   And I fully agree  It was somewhat better than gone girl actually  A good thriller that reads fairly quickly  I would recommend  I loved how this story was told through narrators with such  weak  self biased perspectives that it was difficult to tell what was real  I also loved how the different points of views were shared along a timeline that went forwards and backwards almost at random   yet this random timeline seemed quite perfect and very natural  Very well done psychological thriller  and not surprising that the book is currently  1 on the bestseller list Hard to give this book five stars  though  since all the characters were very flawed   on many levels  The characters were so annoying that they really could drive you to drink   It s nothing like Gone Girl  at all  This is a British thriller mystery type deal  The main female character is a well conceived character that isn t perfect that s about as close a reason I can find to a GG comparison  She s a fairly delusional drunk but much more sympathetic relatable than Flynn s protags  Her POV is consistent and maddening to most sane people  I ve seen other reviews that criticize her behavior like characters in a book should conform to some boring standards  If the character is a borderline stalker  then you shouldn t complain when she acts like a stalker  If you guess who it is  then good for you  There s about 8 characters in the book so you would ve had a pretty decent shot without even reading the book  The whole idea of figuring it out who did it really isn t that obvious and it s not really the point of the book  I don t try to find out who did it as any reader should know the author can contrive any situation to make it any character so there s no point it didn t really happen folks  Entertaining read once it gets going   I liked it  it kept my interest The ending was a bit like all the suspense movie endings  Se avete visto  Gone Girl  avrete notato che la storia e molto simile  Comunque devo dire che il libro mi e piaciuto molto  i personaggi sono ben caratterizzati  anche se la protagonista e ovviamente quella con piu spessore  La storia scorre bene e intrigante e dato che la letteratura contemporanea e quella che e forse e il miglior libro di questa estate 2015  Rachel pendelt taglich mit dem Zug nach London  Auf Grund einer Signalstorung halt der Zug jeden Morgen an der gleichen Stelle an und gewahrt Rachel einen Blick in fremde Hauser  Rachel beobachtet die darin lebenden Menschen  gibt ihnen Namen und baut in ihrer Vorstellung ein perfektes Bild von ihnen auf  Doch eines Tages geschieht etwas  was nicht in Rachels Bild passt  Als kurz darauf auch noch eine Bewohnerin der Hauser verschwindet  wendet Rachel sich an die Polizei und wird immer tiefer in die Geschichte hineingezogen Die Geschichte wird aus der Ich Perspektive von Rachel  Anna und Megan erzahlt Rachel  welche die Hauptfigur ist  ist eine Alkoholikerin und lebt fernab der Realitat in ihrer eigenen Blase  Ich habe Rachel immer wieder als abstossend empfunden  Gleichzeitig hat sie mir sehr Leid getan  Im Laufe der Geschichte erzahlt die Autorin warum Rachel angefangen hat zu trinken  man erfahrt welcher Leidensdruck hinter einer Alkoholsucht steckt und sieht zu welchen Problemen sie fuhren kann  Anna hat mich sehr genervt und ich habe sie als extrem uberheblich empfunden  Ich verstehe zwar viele ihrer Sorgen und Probleme  dennoch habe ich ihr nicht getraut  dafur hat sie sich fur mich zu sehr hinter einer Maske aus  Ich bin ja so eine tolle Mutter und Ehefrau  versteckt  Auch mit Megan bin ich nicht wirklich warm geworden  Sie war mir einfach zu flatterhaft und unbestandig Wirklich sympathisch ist mir also keine der drei Figuren gewesen  Figuren  die mir nicht sympathisch sind oder mich gar so abstossen  wie Rachel es stellenweise tut  fuhren oft dazu  dass ich ein Buch abbreche  Bei dieser Geschichte hat mich das jedoch nicht gestort  denn die Figuren sind fur diese Geschichte genau richtig so wie sie sind Die Geschichte hat mich gepackt  ich wollte immer wissen was passiert ist  was aus der Vermissten geworden ist und ob sie nicht vielleicht doch wieder auftaucht  Daruber habe ich auch nachgedacht  wenn ich nicht gelesen habe  Ein bisschen ist das Buch so  wie wenn man von einem solchen Vermisstenfall in der Zeitung liest und in den Tagen danach noch haufiger an die verschwundene Person denkt Im Laufe der Zeit entsteht ein immer komplexeres Gesamtbild  Dadurch  dass man erst einmal wenig weiss  baut sich schnell Spannung auf  In der Mitte zieht sich die Geschichte etwas und ich habe immer darauf gewartet  dass etwas passiert  Auf den letzten 150 Seiten nimmt die Spannung dann aber wieder zu  Ich konnte keiner der Figuren trauen  hatte zwar immer wieder einmal eine Vermutung  was denn geschehen ist  richtig aufgeklart hat sich aber alles erst gegen Ende  Auch werden gegen Ende einige noch offene Fragen beantwortet  so dass sich das Ende rund und richtig anfuhlt Insgesamt hat mich  Girl on the train  von Paula Hawkins wirklich sehr gut unterhalten  Die Figuren fand ich interessant  denn jede der drei Ich Erzahlerinnen bricht auf ihre ganz eigene Art mit den gesellschaftlichen Normen in der Hoffnung  ihr Gluck zu finden  In der Mitte war die Story ein klein wenig langatmig  davon abgesehen fand ich sie aber spannend  Und auch mit dem Ende bin ich zufrieden  Suspenseful  but reminds me of a lifetime or made for TV movie  Female character development strong  but male characters were far less developed  Created an imbalance in the story  especially at the end   4 5 stars Everyone in this book is absolutely terrible  and as a result  this book is a masterpiece in character study and development  It s also a well written  precisely plotted psychological thriller  and deftly sketches one unreliable narrator after another  I guessed the culprit not too far into the book  but that didn t spoil my reading experience at all  particularly because the author drops so many diverting and convincing red herrings into the story  I think it s also interesting that the central character  Rachel  challenges readers to think about how much we assume about  and pre judge  other people based on our limited knowledge of them  To feel pity  disgust  frustration  compassion  and so much more for one character is a rare thing  Recommended to fans of Before I Go To Sleep  and for YA readers  fans of Dangerous Girls and Nova Ren Suma   This is not bad  It is quite well written and very readable  The story is good  albeit a bit forced at times  The style works well  switching between the different women involved  usually as a look back at what has just happened  It does jump about in time a bit but this does just about work ok  I did find the main character a bit stupid and found it hard too empathise with her  In fact there was nothing about any of the characters which was likeable  I didn t mind what happened to any of them  It s not quite as good as some of the books it is compared to i e  Gone Girl  but it s quality of writing does raise it above many  I would recommend it  Had me hooked from the beginning and kept me on the edge till the very end  When all the pieces of the puzzle started fitting into place  I found myself shocked    I really wasn t expecting that twist  The Girl on The Train was a suspenseful page turner  Okay  I gotta admit that it was kind of hard to get into but by the time the actual crime took place I was super hooked  All I wanted to do was read and find out more and more  I m not really a fan of thrillers and or crime books but I did enjoy the writing style of this book  I didn t think the plot was so complex or intense but the characters  how complex their stories and their personalities are  especially Megan  kept me interested in finding out the real criminal  The ending was a satisfying one  It was fitting and I think it did justice for all of the characters although I d liked to read more about Scott and Abdic  Still a great read   There has been much hype about this book  so I was glad when my e book came in so that I could read it  I was not disappointed with the book and  in fact  I enjoyed it more than Gone Girl and The Paying Guests  which are the two most recent books I ve read of this genre  I think the three female viewpoints help to keep the book interesting and it certainly helps to maintain the tension  All three women are strong characters  and the three main male characters are realistic and strong too  Rachel is the main character  and when we meet her  she is a train wreck  She s lost her husband and her job  and she drowns her sorrows in alcohol  All the time I was reading about her blackout drunks  I felt that there was a lot more behind the drinking than even she admits to herself  Megan is another woman who has lost her job  Even though she has a husband who loves her  she is profoundly unhappy  Her sorrow is as a result of a past event that happened to her years ago  and it causes her to make many bad choices that will eventually come to a catastrophic conclusion  Anna appears to be the most normal one  but even she has personal crises that cause her distress and her  perfect  life is really not what it appears  The males that are involved with these women  both past and present  have their own demons that will have a profound impact on these women and on their lives  The thing that ties up all the loose threads in the story and all the lives of these characters is the commuter train that runs by their houses at many different times of the day  The train is the one constant thing that never changes and it s what brings all these people into proximity  As the tension builds  masks are removed and the three women finally begin to see things clearly  For some it is too late  For others a long overdue redemption finally comes to them  Nothing really is as it seems in this little community  The book is a very good psychological thriller and I enjoyed it  Great book with lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing right until the end  A murder mystery  suspense thriller Felt it was a little hurried at the end and enjoyed the tension and build up better Centres on the lives of three women Rachel  Anna and Megan  Although Rachel  the girl on the train  is the main character the story moves along hearing from each woman Interesting to have Rachel as a drunk  added another dimension as you didn t know whether her account was reliable  La verdad    Lo logro  no pude dejar de leer a pesar que no lo pude leer seguido pero me gusto mucho  el principio es un poco lento y raramente redactado y el final creo tambien le falto algo peeeeero para ser su primera novela creo que lo logro bastante bien y a pesar de que mi primera sospecha resulto ser el mero mero  si me hizo dudar de mi suposicion casi todo el libro    La verdad si me gusto y mucho  D Buku ini rasa misterinya kuat banget  jauh lebih gelap dari Gone Girl ataupun Dark Place  Ada permainan emosi yang membuat kita merasakan ketidaktenangan para tokohnya  kemarahan  rasa sakit  kesedihan  ketakutan  bahkan kegilaan  Rachel si pecandu minuman keras  jelas kesulitan membedakan antara realitas dan khayalan  Ketidakstabilan emosinya membuatnya melakukan hal hal buruk yg bahkan tidak dapat diyakini oleh dirinya sendiri  Aku merasa sedikit kasihan padanya karena semua orang melimpahkan kesalahan kepadanya dengan alasan dia pemabuk dan tidak stabil  Megan yang cantik  cacat secara emosi  Karakter seperti Megan sering kita jumpai dibanyak buku  Cantik  cerdas  periang dan menarik tapi memiliki sisi gelap dalam dirinya  masa lalu yang membuatnya tidak pernah benar benar menjadi dirinya sendiri  Dia bisa menjadi siapapun  tapi tidak bisa menjadi dirinya sendiri  Seorang artis  seorang pembohong  Sedangkan Anna  ada yg salah dengannya  Rasanya susah untuk percaya bahwa dia wanita  istri dan ibu yg benar benar baik   susah untuk menyukainya  ada kemunafikkan dalam dirinya  Sama seperti Megan  dia seorang artis yang hebat  seorang pembohong dan penipu  Pada akhirnya  setiap orang harus berdamai dengan dirinya sendiri  dengan masalahnya  dengan masa lalunya  dengan hidupnya   The movie will be interesting     Skillful writing     Rachael s unreliably provides enough questions so as to keep this reader uncertain as to what s real  what s imagined       4 5 stars  So suspenseful  I had to keep reading these past 2 days to see how things end  I m sure it will be a movie real soon  Ever wondered what goes on in the houses you come across on your daily commute  Do you invent stories for the people who live in them  Reality is often far different from the one created by our imagination  Paula Hawkins has written a page turner  despite the ending that  for me  was a bit overdone and predictable  I enjoyed very much reading this book  A great debut novel  will be looking forward to her next book   originally reviewed at  elphareads tumblr com  I was super late to the GONE GIRL party  I don t know what happened  but it took me forever to get on that  When I got to the party  let s continue the metaphor   I was like  woo  yes  Here I am let s party    But then when I left I was like  that was awful I should have stayed home   I really didn t like that book   It Book  status and everything  So recently  it became pretty clear that THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN by Paula Hawkins was going to be the next It Book at my library  In that there were already 200  requests on it after it got my attention  I put myself on the list  figuring I d have a long wait  Serendipity intervened  and I got my hands on a copy  Rachel rides the train every day  It s really the only thing that gives her solace  Her marriage fell apart  she has a drinking problem  she lost her job  her life is a mess  On top of all that  her ex  whom she is still hung up on  married his mistress and had a baby with her  Rachel s infertility was one of the driving factors of her drinking problem  and knowing he had a baby with his mistress just twists the knife   Every day she rides the train  living her life vicariously through two strangers she sees in their home by the tracks  She calls them Jason and Jess  and they seem sublimely happy  She cherishes the peeks into their relationship she gets each day on her ride  and feels like she knows them  But one day she sees something that breaks her illusion of their happiness  And shortly thereafter  Jess  or Megan  as her real name is  goes missing  Rachel wants to help figure out what happened to her  but is seen as an unreliable witness  even though she thinks she saw something that could break the case wide open  As Rachel starts her own personal investigation  she starts to uncover truths about not only Megan  but about herself as well  And all of these truths could be quite dangerous Well I liked it better than GONE GIRL  so it has that going for it  Though at times it was very hard to read because Rachel is SUCH a mess  I found THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN very hard to put down  Told in multiple perspectives  Rachel s  Megan s  and Anna s  the mistress of Rachel s ex   this book is one big jumble of unreliable narrators  But what I liked about it was that while you thought you were solving one mystery  there were other things to be solved  things that it took me awhile to see coming  I can t say anymore because that would ruin the fun  I found Rachel to be absolutely pathetic and hard to read about  but as I got to know her more my initial vague disgust turned into some serious pity  The girl is messed up  Really  none of the voices were easy to read  Rachel is an unstable mess  Megan is a vain flibbertigibbet  and Anna is a flat out bitch  Yeah  I said it  But they were all very real in their own ways and they were all very interesting in their own ways as well  I kind of had a feeling I knew where it was going  but it still had a fair number of revelations that I found surprising  It definitely kept me guessing in a lot of ways  I actually stayed up far too late last night just so I could finish it  so it has that going for it  And unlike GONE GIRL  while the characters were all messes in their own right  at least I could find people to root for  and had an understanding of why they were such messes  I think that if this book keeps up it s momentum we will see a movie based on it  Whether that movie will give us a glimpse of Ben Affleck butt remains to be seen  but THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN was a tense read that hooked me in  Very gripping right to the end  Would make a good film adaptation   Quello che mi e piaciuto di questo libro e quello che tanti potrebbero benissimo odiare  I personaggi sono TUTTI imperfetti  la protagonista principale e essenzialmente un inetta ma nonostante tutto riesci comunque ad immedesimarti in lei  I personaggi sono estremamente reali e per la maggior parte anche squallidi  Soprattutto Anna che non ho potuto vedere dall inizio alla fine  Non e un romanzo positivo  anzi  A me ha appassionato molto anche il mistero  che si risolve tutto nelle ultime pagine  ma mi hanno appassionato anche i rapporti fra i personaggi  il loro evolversi e il generale senso di catastrofe che aleggia in tutta la storia  What a great read  It went so quickly for me and once I started it I didn t want to stop Rachel rides the train every day and sees the same couple in their backyard  eventually  she creates names and personas for them  But one day  she sees something in that backyard that changes everything  What she sees is not what you think and while the ending wasn t mind blowing  it kept me wanting to pick up the book to know what happened next  In my book  that s pretty highly rated  Psychological thrillers in the vein of Gone Girl are becoming mighty popular right now  which may be why some people will pick up Girl on the Train  The similarities are there for sure   flawed characters who you can t help but love to hate  a twisty plot that keeps you guessing and an ending that leaves you feeling just slightly uncomfortable  And this formula  It works  I was hooked on this book almost from the very first page and overwhelmed with a need to know just what happened  unlike Gone Girl though  I figured this one out pretty soon   Girl on the Train is highly entertaining and definitely worth picking up if this genre is your thing   A nice quick read  l kept thinking l knew who it was but was surprised at the end  Not what l was expecting when l picked up the book   People compare the book with Gone Girl as it deals with the  sinister sides  of women  Well  to some extent  it does remind me of Gone Girl  but for me  it s still two different things  The book is an easy read  I could finish it in just a day  The story starts when Rachel Watson is on the train  commutes from her home to London  Between the places  the train will stop for a while  and she will observe the live of others in the track side house  Everyday she ll see her favorite couple whom she named as  Jason and Jess  and she ll construct and deconstruct their lives in her head  She thinks they re perfect until something happened to  Jess  The book has three PoVs  all of them are women  Each PoV is from the first person  so when it comes to Rachel s PoV  things are quite blurry  as she is an alcoholic and has problems on remembering things  Compared to my hating towards Amy from Gone Girl  I find myself not hating Rachel  Rachel is perhaps unlikeable as she is alcoholic and unable to keep her life straight  But  I think I have same position with Rachel s flatmate  Cathy  I am unable to hate her  I feel sorry for her instead  For the plot itself  it s smooth and engaging  The clues are here and there and can be easily picked up  As for me  I was able to suspect the villain from the second half of the book  but I still didn t see the real  monster  coming in the end  It kinda surprised me how the final chapters going and somehow I like how it finally ends for Rachel  Last verdict  4 stars   Gloomy  immersive  and addictive   This appealed very much to the Investigation Discovery fan in me  It is creepy and interesting in a downcast  cry in the shower  duck under the covers kind of way  The depression and alcoholism fairly jumps off the pages  This story sucks you in with a vise grip as you  the reader  loftily think you have the moral high ground on these women  only  by the middle pages  you re not too sure  Our main protagonist  Rachel  is a hot mess but I couldn t help rooting for her to get sober and get her act together and be less unreliable  Perhaps  it s the shared interest in looking out train windows and imagining the lives of the people who live in the houses that pass by  Perhaps  it s because we re all just a wobbly inch away from being hot messes ourselves  I have heard this book compared to Gone Girl a lot   which was obvious given the crazy female protagonists  But this book has not one but three of them  And though I will give Gone Girl the stealth and the artistry in the reveal  The Girl on the Train has the advantage of being captivating right away and sustaining that mood through out  Plus  it ties itself up in a neat little bow at the end  sometimes  the reader deserves a full  unmitigated  absolute conclusion  Interesting mystery  unreliable narrator  which makes things confusing at times  Worth reading through to the end  It didn t blow me away but it was consistently good   Definitely a page turner Rachel  an alcoholic  is struggling to come to terms with how her life currently is and reconciling that with how her life was  She then involves herself into the murder investigation of a woman who she has seen daily from the window of her train commute to and from London  As usual  things imagined are never how they turn out to be  which Rachel painfully discovers I felt manipulated while reading this book yet  it s a good representation of reality  first impressions mean a lot  but things are not always what they seem  Amazing and gripping till the very end   very original story line  edge of the seat type stuff   I really liked this book  couldn t put it down  I liked the hot mess cast of characters  there s no  good guy  in this book  But then the ending really let me down  With so many despicable characters in the book I was expecting something more sinister  Seems to me the author choose the easy way out in an effort to validate her main character  Definitely knocked it down a star for me  I enjoyed this book  It took me a while to get into it  I couldn t really relate to the characters at first but by a third in I couldn t put it down  Love trying to figure out whodunnit   04   A book published this yearWell  here s a book that I never thought I d end up enjoying but actually did  Since I had to pick a book that was published this year  2015   and had no idea whatsoever of what was out there  I decided to grab my Kindle and check the reviews for all releases within the year  This one was at the top and I know what you re thinking  how can you pick a book based solely on its reviews  Well  I didn t    mostly  I downloaded a sample chapter and investigated what the book was about before actually making the purchase  I liked that it was a mystery  and that the main character was a girl  which contrasted with Fight Club  my previous read  which is a story that features mostly guys  Little did I know there were a few surprises The story itself was kind of slow at first  though not un interesting  It took time for me to get used to it and how it developed  It was surprising to find out it was not written from one girl s point of view  but three actually  And all in first person  This allowed me as a reader to get to know the characters and their feelings much better  You get to know what they think and experience  which can be both satisfying and unnerving when getting to know them  But it was great to see how Rachel  the main character  untied the knot and finally resolved her biggest concern  thus proving that being a drunk was not the biggest of her problems  And you can actually relate to all characters  as they are very real and very human  filled with flaws and insecurities I would have liked for some more diversity in the characters  It s a book that is very girly  in a way  but without being overly     pink  I guess could be the word  These are full on  violent bitches when they have to be  but there isn t a lot of male presence within the characters  So  again  I was surprised  I wasn t expecting to like the book  it was very modern  but Brits still got it  I m happy I followed my instincts  I d totally recommend it if you re not looking for anything too serious to read and just want to entertain yourself to a good mystery  Did not predict the ending  Would ve been better to read in book instead of Kindle  so I could follow dates as they jumped around  I keep hearing this book called  this year s Gone Girl   The two novels share a missing woman  is she dead    a sociopath  an unreliable narrator  and a swift cutting plot device with chapters narrated by different characters  Both are page turners  Can t wait to read  Gone Girl of late 2015 or 2016  next  once a novel is so anointed  Di chi ti puoi veramente fidare Ho  divorato  questo libro Mi e piaciuta molto la tecnica di narrazione  3 donne  3 punti di vista differenti Nulla e come sembra  ce lo insegna  La ragazza del treno  Rachel e una ragazza come tante  insoddisfatta della sua vita  che si perde in quella di altri ogni volta che prende QUEL treno  Il suo interesse e la sua curiosita sono rivolti  in particolar modo  a Jess e Jason  la coppia perfetta a cui Rach guarda con un pizzico di  invidia   La verita e che nessuno di noi puo realmente sapere com e la vita di chi lo circonda Cosa si cela dietro il sorriso della nostra vicina di casa  Il matrimonio idilliaco dei nostri amici e cosi meraviglioso come appare Tutti nascondono dei segreti  Alcuni segreti sono peggiori di altri e possono davvero cambiare la vita di una persona Rachel lo sperimentera sulla propria pelle  probabilmente pentendosi di non essere rimasta una semplice spettatrice  nascosta dietro il finestrino di un treno  4 5Super adictivo  con personajes muy interesantes ya que todos eran problematicos  Para la gente que disfruta un buen thriller THIS IS THE BOOK  I actually think this book is worth the hype   it s an incredibly strong debut  It s kind of obvious why it s compared to  Gone Girl  so much  but it s a much better book  In  Gone Girl  you also have an unreliable narrator  and a missing person  The big difference for me was that in GG I could barely tolerate the main characters at the start and wound up hating them   by the end I felt they deserved each other  In this book  Rachel starts out as pretty unsympathetic and by the end of the book I was totally in her corner  Meagan and Anna also began as  and could have remained  stereotypes  The way the author changes your perspective on pretty much every character is incredible Not all of the twists in this thriller are that surprising  But the end was strong and it was a fast  really compelling read The story is told from the perspective of different characters at different points in time  Since the voices can be similar  it was a little hard to tell them apart at times   you had to remember when the speaker was talking  But that was really the only problem I had with this book  A crazy psychological thriller  thank you Hitessh for the recommendation   It s crazy how your life can get tied to people you don t even know  Rachel  mid thirty woman  alcoholic  has a messy life  after being unable to have a child  she goes through a painful divorce  can t move on with her life and can t get herself together  her only escape is alcohol and those moments she imagines the life of  Jess and Jason   a couple she picures perfect  who lives on the same street she used to and where her ex and his new wife are living now  and whom she observes from her train every day  a murder happens  she was too drunk to remember  she thinks she s done something bad  some scraps of memory get back to her but she can t tell if it s her brain or what s really happened  Anna  the new wife  the one who s known all about it and who didn t bother to clarify  mother of a child  Evy   thinks she s better than Rachel and that she s having a perfect little life until the truth strikes her and she realises that she s nothing like Rachel  she s much worse if I allow myself to compare both of them  Megan  Jess   a broken soul I guess  sometimes a mindless young woman  the secret she s keeping deprives her life from sens  married to Scott  Jason   a jealous man who tries to please her  once a galery owner  she doesn t know what to do with herself when she no longer works  so she starts a series of affairs  one of them s gonna lead her to her end  These are the three main characters the story revolves around  three women  totally different but tied together by some kind of destiny   Rachel  the girl on the train  has a life that has fallen apart and is headed nowhere fast  along with a serious drinking problem  She becomes involved in the disappearance of Anna when she witnesses a scene from the train that she thinks is crucial to the investigation  The Girl on the Train read like a Lifetime movie  a good one  but still  a Lifetime movie  Plot 3 stars  Character development and writing  4 stars  Sorry we never got a chance to talk about it  Paul   I will remember this book  not so much because it was memorable  but because of you    I have lost control over everything  even the places in my head   Rachel Lo que vamos a hacer es que les voy a hacer una lista de 4 cosas que me gustaron y 4 que no sobre este libro Primero lo que NO ME GUSTO 1  Es algo predecible 2  Los personajes masculinos me parecieron algo  Meh  cuando los comparabas con lo profundo que podrian llegar a ser los femeninos 3  Fue no tan emocionante como creido seria  Y es un libro chulo  pero no es para tanto 4  Rachel  el personaje principal  mas que simpatia lo que me daba era una pena y a veces hasta risa  al menos hasta casi el final  Lo que pasa es que estaba loquita Ahora lo que SI ME GUSTO 1  Es predecible  pero al menos es entretenido  Sabia el final hace un ratico  pero aun asi lo disfrute 2  Las mujeres son preciosas en este libro  Son personajes tan  rotos  que los sientes super reales  Me cayeron bien ellas  3  Me gusto la narracion  Eso de que se contaba todo desde las perspectiva de 3 mujeres que  al principio no parecen tener tanto en comun y luego te das cuenta de que si  y lo de las fechas y manana y tarde  aunque no es que sea lo mas original del mundo  estuvo chevere 4  Gracias a ese libro aprendi que cuando me enamore de alguien tendre cuidado  A veces hacemos muchos disparates cuando queremos a alguien e ignoramos la verdad estando delante de nosotros  pero no negare esta gente se pasaban  Twisted  fast paced and totally believable  My take away is that this is a worthy read with some thrills and chills thrown in for good measure   Girl on the Train  gehort zu den Buchern  die in diesem Sommer besonders gehypt werden  Kaum eine Buchhandlung  die nicht einen riesengrossen Buchstapel davon bereits am Eingang stehen hat  sodass man an diesem Buch nur schwer vorbeigehen kann  Da ich eigentlich bei solchen Hype Buchern sehr skeptisch bin  hatte ich dementsprechend nur geringe Erwartungen an diese Geschichte  allerdings konnte mich die Autorin sehr uberraschen  denn dieses Buch hat den Hype durchaus verdient Ich muss zwar gestehen  dass ich am Anfang etwas Probleme mit der Geschichte hatte  weil auf den ersten Seiten nicht wirklich passiert und man lediglich erfahrt  dass Rachel jeden Tag pendelt und dabei die Hauser beobachtet und sich zu den einzelnen Menschen Geschichten ausdenkt  Dies kann naturlich interessant sein  allerdings hatte die Autorin hier einiges etwas interessanter gestalten konnen  Danach wurde die Geschichte aber zusehends besser  Die Handlung nimmt an Fahrt auf  wird immer spannender und am Ende habe ich mit Rachel mitgefiebert und wollte unbedingt mehr uber alles erfahren  sodass ich das Buch nur noch schwer aus den Handen nehmen konnte  Rachel ist zwar an sich nicht unbedingt die grosste Sympathietragerin aller Zeiten  weil sie sich selbst standig belugt und sich gewisse Dinge nicht eingestehen mochte  allerdings fand ich ihre Geschichte dennoch sehr interessant  Auch die anderen Figuren  wie z B  Megan sind interessant und gut ausgearbeitet  Da die Geschichte auch aus der Sicht von Megan erzahlt wird  bekommt man einen sehr guten und authentischen Einblick in ihr Leben und die Gewissheit  dass nicht alles immer so ist  wie es scheint  Wahrend Rachel sich immer wieder das Leben anderer Menschen vorstellt und diese fur das von ihr erfundene Leben beneidet  bemerkt sie nicht  was sie damit sich und anderen anrichtet und somit ist es kein Wunder  dass sie sich viel zu sehr fur Megan interessiert  die fur sie in der Kurzbeschreibung jedoch nur Jess ist  da sie sich deren Leben immer wieder ausgemalt hat  Ausserdem kommt hier noch Anna zu Wort  die ich trotz ihrer interessanten Geschichte leider absolut nicht sympathisch fand  denn diese ist jetzt mit Rachels Ex Partner zusammen  den sie ihr ausgespannt hat  Es war von daher manchmal schwierig  ihrer Geschichte mit diesem Wissen im Hinterkopf zu folgen Dabei wird hierbei oft die Geschichte aus der Gegenwart  aber auch aus der Vergangenheit erzahlt  sodass man als Leser viele Momente hautnah erleben darf  die von der Autorin sehr detailliert und lebhaft beschrieben werden  Dabei ist auch klar  wie schlecht es den drei jungen Frau oftmals geht  bzw  ergangen ist  So sehr ich stellenweise auch mit ihnen mitgelitten habe  blieb jedoch immer eine gewisse Distanz  was ich jedoch vollkommen in Ordnung finde  da dies bei einem Thriller dieser Art manchmal ganz gut so ist Das Ende hat mir unglaublich gut gefallen  Die Auflosung war nur minimal vorhersehbar und ich habe mich dabei erwischt  wie ich beim Schliessen des Buches anerkennend genickt hat  was bei einem Thriller bei mir nicht haufig vorkommt  Die Autorin beantwortet hierbei noch sehr viele offene Fragen und nach und nach ergibt alles ein Ganzes  mit dem ich sehr gut leben kann Das Cover ist schlicht  gefallt mir aber fur einen Thriller sehr gut  besonders die Farbverlaufe sind gut gewahlt  Die Kurzbeschreibung ist ebenfalls gelungen und hat mich direkt angesprochen  sodass ich diesem Bestseller unbedingt eine Chance geben wollte  Insgesamt konnte mich  Girl On The Train  aufgrund seiner gut ausgearbeiteten Figuren  einem interessanten Plot und vielen spannenden Momenten begeistern  sodass ich das Buch nur sehr schwer aus den Handen legen konnte  Ich kann es demnach nur empfehlen und freue mich auf weitere Bucher von der talentierten Autorin  I really enjoyed this book  It was a well written story  and I do in particular  really love when books are written in the first person  and also when there are then more than one person so you get a broad perspective  I like the way the chapters flow from one person to the next     Beyond that  the story itself was well told  I like how the details that one person observed were then later seen in a later chapter in a different persons version of the story    For example  Rachel witnesses something from the train     then later on  Megan describes that same situation and mentions the passing train  Very clever and well thought out I did think it ran a little slow in the middle  At one point  I was tempted to just google what happens  lol     But I didn t  and I stuck with it  and I am glad that I did  The story does unfold and then pulls itself back together in a solid fashion It did leave me thinking though    I thought the very end might have been better  but it was still good    And it did have me questioning thing about life  which hey  is why we read  right  But issues like love  friendship  how well we really know anybody  what is real and what is not    these themes are all in this book  and if you like books that make you think about it afterwards  you will be happy with this one    The story line of this book was a solid one  but it was slow to start for me  I had a tough time figuring out what was really going on with the main character  and then when I did figure it out  she stressed me out  After the story started to develop I really loved how the characters seemed to be so intertwined  and their personalities seemed to mirror each other  Their struggles were real and the emotions were portrayed very well  The part of this book that I liked the most was that it kept me guessing until about the last 20 pages and I loved that I didn t know what was going on right away  One more note  I often saw this book compared to Gone Girl  and I loved Gone Girl  And I can see some similar themes like crazy  train wreck women and a murder mystery  but I wouldn t compare the two  With that said  I did really enjoy this book   was definitely a good book  confusion at 1st with the seperate time lines  but as you got further into the book everything tied in great  i am glad that Holly recommended this read  i definitely wasnt disappointed  haunting  heart breaking  fascinating  I gave it a 4 not cuz it is a great novel  but it was a fun thriller with a damaged anti heroine  and kept you reading  I once read a book by a former alcoholic where she described giving oral sex to two different men  men she d just met in a restaurant on a busy London high street  I read it and I thought  I m not that bad  This is where the bar is set oh  yeah   this one is going to be a must read for those people looking to find their next Gone Girl experience  it s an incredibly fast paced and engrossing psychological thriller  and i was on board as soon as i read the editor s bit of ARC copy  even though i know that writing those things is part of the job and not at all unbiased  but it s hard not to be swayed when you read Within days of my introducing the manuscript in March  people from every department were regularly pulling me aside to testify to how much they loved the read  how they couldn t put it down  At a recent meeting  a colleague who was twelve pages from the end was secretly reading them under the table because she could not stop  Another had the manuscript propped up next to her phone so she could read between calls  and last week in the elevator  people around me suddenly started competing over who d read it fastest  and who was more surprised by the ending  You know you have something special when it becomes watercooler talk for months on end it would take a very stubbornly cynical person to see that as anything other than genuine enthusiasm  and the book definitely delivers  it is an absolute page turner with a number of unreliable narrators ranging from the self deluded to the spotty memory of the blackout drunk  i am too busy reading on my daily commute to notice my fellow passengers unless they are smelly behaving in an unstable manner  frequently   or exceptionally attractive  MUCH less frequently   but apparently this is a thing that commuters do   notice their fellow travelers  making up stories about their lives  speculating about what they do when they re not in the in between moments of their day  and rachel does it more than most  rachel is blisteringly lonely  drowning the sorrows of her failed marriage with grim determination and canned gin and tonics and endless bottles of wine  she has lost her job because of her perpetual drunkenness  but rather than tell her flatmate  she keeps taking the train into london every day  pretending to go to work  but actually just getting drunk in various places  and happily fantasizing about the young couple she watches every day from her train window  a couple who live a few doors down from her old house  where her ex husband tom still resides with his new wife and baby girl  still reeling from tom s infidelity to her  she nonetheless would love to be back with him  and in this golden couple she observes and imagines  calling them  jess and jason   she sees the life she could have had with tom  one day  while commuting gazing voyeuristically  she witnesses  jess  on her front lawn with another man  in what appears to be a romantic clinch  she is outraged at this display  as personally offended as if the infidelity were being committed against herself  shortly after this episode  she learns that  jess   actually named megan  has disappeared  and feeling connected to this couple she has never actually met  she insinuates herself into the investigation  meeting with both the police and megan s husband  actual name scott  the story is told from three perspectives  rachel s  megan s  and tom s new wife anna  and covers all the traditional viewpoints of the typical domestic drama  the jilted lover  the other woman  the cheating wife  all three of these women are simultaneously sympathetic and repellent  which is tricky to pull off  and as for the mystery of megan s disappearance itself  well that path splits and splits again in a wonderful head spinning journey where not a single character avoids suspicion  except MAYBE tom and anna s infant daughter   i think there are seven characters in total who appear to be the culprit at one point or another  and each seems as plausible as the next  it is a fantastic ride  and hawkins does a great job with both the mystery elements and the character development  with great attention to detail  and fully established backstories and motivations  even when you cringe at some of the choices  they completely make sense for the character  it is a lot of fun  and terribly addictive  much better than a meeting  i kid you not  A psychological thriller that is a wonderful read  It is fascinating  gripping and a little creepy  Think Hitchcock film in a book   I really find myself liking this novel  mainly because it s like something I would write  As a young  trying to get out there  but simplistically having difficulty actually finishing a novel  author writer that may seem difficult to imagine but I am very much engrossed in the adult novel shelf and have been in the process of writing my own  The Girl on the Train is a witty portrayal of the lifestyle of three dishonest narrators  Though of course  The Girl on The Train centre character is Rachel  The girl on the train who observes the couple who she admires  and wants to be basically   Jess and Jason   Now Jess and Jason are seemingly perfect  which is what this woman wants to believe  and then when she see s the dark side of their lives there is no turning back  She is now involved  I love the story  and it is well written for the most part  excusing the fact I did find a few spelling grammatical errors but they were only minor and that could have just been me who spotted those  I don t mean to come off as someone looking for the  mistakes  because I am not  I very much liked this novel   My only problem is that Paula Hawkins  alike A S A Harrison both are inspired by  Gone Girl    Yes  I know  I KNOW  every review on a thriller mystery novel  has  to be compared to Gone Girl  Though I am getting tired of the  new Gone Girl s   Am I alone in this   Well don t get me wrong because I love both Girl on The Train and Gone Girl but I felt Girl on The Train was very much influenced by Flynn s work  I feel like Hawkins really did well in writing the perspectives of all her narrators and her ability to change tone is very good in her writing though there were a lot of the same kind of themes that are in all of the new thrillers right now  Someone has gone missing  Someone has had an affair  The husband wife   for the most part the husband   is the one with the finger being pointed at   A lot of work in new literacy has been heavily influenced by Gone Girl  but what I wonder is if people are writing like  Gone Girl  due to actual inspiration or to see if they can benefit from the same success Flynn has   Aside from all this  new Gone Girl  stuff  I did really like the novel  I could even connect to Rachel which I didn t see myself doing from the first page  There is something I love about her accounts in the story  The girl on the train  The person trying to escape her own life  I understand a lot because we ve all been there at one point  Admiring wishing to be another  I find myself commonly in malls  staring out at the atmosphere and examining others around me   sometimes I want to be YOU   I think when seeing the assumable  rich  people walk past with many bags from Chanel  or when I see the happy content family all smiles and giggles  There are times when we want to escape the world we live in  Rachel is shown to have these thoughts but on a more so intense level  having been very attached to her idea of Jess and Jason  And when finding out what  Jess  has been  doing  she even states that she would  scratch her eyes out  in the early pages   The Girl on the Train  while I believe to be  yes  another novel which is written from the inspiration of Gone Girl  is a very clever novel  I would like to see in the thriller department something more out of the norm because I think this book came out at just the right time  It came out at the period where people wanted more of this Gone Girl alike shock  and it came out just before  at least I think  people had had enough   Hawkins would be on my list for  thriller authors to watch out for  because this work is truly memorable but I do feel like authors should not write due to what they believe will make them successful but to what they are actually thinking and  wanting  to write due to the fact they want to write it  for it to be read  Whether Hawkins does abide to this I do not know  but either way she has written a very clever  very interesting piece of fiction and I wish her all the best as an author  Even though this is the first of her  thriller debuts  I would like to see a more diverse novel next time because as I said before   readers are starting to want more from the thriller norm   and due to what we have seen from Hawkins thus far she could be a great contender to write the next big thing in the thriller sector  hopefully a little more out of the blue and less influenced on other work  Who knows  Would I recommend personally though Yes I just have to say yes because it is such a good novel  and the idea and plot is perfect  If you are getting bored of  seemingly perfect marriage  turns out to not be  than maybe put off the book for a bit and find something else but make sure to come back to it once you have filled your reading palette with something a little more different  I may be wrong in thinking the work is heavily influenced by GG and I may be harsh to say that authors these days are looking to benefit of the same success Flynn has had but personally  if it s me reading the signs  the novels are all being at least slightly based on Flynn s masterpiece  Maybe I am very biased as I just love Gone Girl  and Girl on the Train is more than just a two person account of marriage  It s through a stranger s perspective  it s through  Jess s  perspective   I mean  the story is very good and has looked to pace up and make a more creepy story than GG but ultimately I did find myself sighing at what comparisons I could make while reading between the two books  Still  that is not me saying that it is not good enough because you just have to read it  It s a chilling portrayal of everyday life  and I can very much connect to the most part of the narrators and I can simultaneously love and hate them  If you like books like that  make sure you pick this one of the shelf because it is worth the read   Chilling  This book has been compared to Gone Girl and I can see why  mystery  told from multiple perspectives with different timelines    Loved the British setting and the role of the commuter train   view spoiler  This is also almost a textbook depiction of domestic violence  The author really got to the power and control that the abuser had through manipulation  lying  and isolation  in both Rachel and Anna s lives  Particularly in the way she wrote about alcoholism  and the way that the abuser used Rachel s drinking against her  to spread lies and further isolate  control her  and tear her down    hide spoiler   While this book does not rise to the level of great literature in my mind  it most definitely is engrossing and well written  with characters who  though flawed  you can really care about  and enough plot twists to keep the reader guessing until the very end  I would have rated it 4 5 stars if I knew how  One of those rare books that lived up to all the advance hype  for me  So glad I was finally able to get this at the library  I enjoyed the way the book was written   from three different points of view  It had me guessing up until the last 50 pages and then it hit me like a train  pun intended    I think there s been a little too much hype about this book but it is a good mystery  It s written in the first person from the view point of three different women  It s well written  moves at a good pace and was a real page turner at times   Well  this is strange  I quite nearly didn t even read this book  because everyone has been comparing it to Gone Girl  Frankly  that book was not great for me  This book  though   the character development of the three central women was excellent  and I found as I read that I could tell whose perspective it was without having looked at the chapter heading  which is not at all something common to all books written in this style  though of course it should be   As far as the whodunnit itself  well  I was pretty sure who the culprit would be well before the big reveal  That said  I remained engrossed  This is a real page  or screen  turner  This was non stop  deliver the drama goods with a big handful of pathetic and in some cases despicable characters who make a constant parade of poor life decisions  This leaves their mixed up lives in a 40 car pileup of a story that you cannot stop rubbernecking your way through  Just when you pause long enough to shake your head there s another totally preventable scenario  and you just can t stop until it s over  I did not love it  but I honestly couldn t put it down either  A good read  indeed if you can settle for some gross entertainment  Gripping  well written  and well organized psychological thriller that I found very difficult to turn off  I loved the voices of the British women reading it  Their voices really fit the characters  I can still hear them narrating in my head This is also a fascinating look into the life of an alcoholic  though I can t say more about that without giving away plot points  It certainly also gets you looking at your routine surroundings a bit more carefully I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because there is some  though not a gratuitous amount of profane language  particularly using God s name in vain  which  as a Christian  I don t appreciate  I do think she could have used other words and gotten the same effect  though maybe it does say something about the character who uses the most profanity Overall  an entertaining read with well defined and interesting characters Some have compared this book to  Gone Girl   I have read both and there certainly are similarities as both books unfold the plot as you go along  but there is certainly less profanity in this book than in  Gone Girl   which I appreciated and it s perhaps a bit less disturbing and ends more satisfactorily  I would almost give this a 4 5 since the story was unique and exciting  The characters are well developed  Every character seemed to have some sort of psychological problem that in the last 50 pages told the whole story  We find out the details of everyone s craziness in the end and learn who did what to whom  Hawkins has definitely written a top selling novel and it s a book I d recommend if you like suspense and fingernail biting sequences  It wasn t a perfect book  but very close to it  Couldn t put this one down  A great weekend read  I read this book in a day and I rarely do this  It is very captivating  you get the feeling it gets a bit boring towards the middle and then it picks up the pace again The book follows mostly Rachel  a divorced alcoholic  and her struggle to get over her failed marriage and find a new purpose for herself  Most of the action revolves around the train trips she takes from a small suburb of London to the city and back  On her journeys  she imagines various scenarios about the lives of the people living in house by the train track and she ends up becoming a part of one of those stories The style  the theme and the ending  all reminded me of  This Charming Man  I end up thinking about what it takes for a relationship to work and how important trust is  This is the first book of this genre that I read  First glance at the cover  I knew it was mysterious  yes  but i had no idea it would be so heavy  It deals with some very serious subjects  you get to plunge into what it s like to live the life of a very unstable woman  surrounded by also very troubled people Rachel has connections with  Alcoholic  heartbroken  financially challenged  not sure who to turn to  living her life with lies and betrayal    these pages have brought me to really realize what it must be like for many people today who actually live with such difficult lives  I never see murder in the news the same way again  I feel as if everything has a backstory now  no matter how simple  These characters are so complicated  the way they act  the unexplainable things they do    yet somehow I m given the chance to analyze their behaviour and understand them  You never meet much joy in this novel  and it makes you realize how things aren t always as they seem  Details in life matter  and we are all connected  Facts  lies  truths    they re all connected by threads  I don t know if I liked this book  It impacted me and the mystery and uneasiness hit me hard and hooked me on  I had very high expectations  and they kind of fell a bit  I think all I have to really say is that this story didn t really make me feel good  but it made me feel something  and after all  isn t that what a book is suppose to do  I disliked this story in the extreme  I felt like I was trapped in the head of a disturbed person who had no prospect of help  no hope  and the only certainty in her days was the prospect of one  self inflicted  disaster after another  It s compelling  well paced  and well edited  unfortunately  so I m stuck giving it 4 stars  I read it because I needed to know if anything good happened  to anybody  by the end  and also  because it was my book club s selection and I didn t want to let them down  But ugh   Everyone in this book is pitiful and disturbing  Everything that happens in this book makes you want to personally reach through the pages and wring all of the character s necks  What a bunch of drunken  idiotic morons    Of course that means this giant hot mess of a story was SO much fun that I finished it in 2 sittings  I never  ever read books like this but for some reason  I was tempted and made my husband stop at Barnes and Noble for it  There is a first time for everything  a physiological murder mystery and him buying a book   Ha  When he deposited The Girl on the Train into my hands  he said all the girls at the store loved it so maybe it would be entertaining  It was and I couldn t put it down I was a little worried about content seeing how it was based on an alcoholics instabilities and her coping mechanisms whilst trying to figure out the mystery of a woman who vanished and her own possible role in the events surrounding her disappearance  All the while  she is stalking her ex  who also happens to be a lying  cheating pos  While there was definitely some profanity  and the content is very mature  talk of some drug abuse  an abortion  affairs  physical abuse  mental instability and of course murder  surprisingly  this was not an uncomfortable read  I would have hated tossing an expensive book into the trash   the author did a great job of delivering twists and turns and keeping a book of this nature on the up and up as much as possible I stepped outside my box on this one and I think I may do it again sometime    Drie voor het verhaal  vier voor de spanning waarmee het boek me toch vasthield  Niemand is te vertrouwen en iedereen kan het gedaaan hebben  Had het op een bepaald moment door  maar dat is natuurlijk ook de bedoeling  zonder dat ik het gevoel had dat het voorspelbaar was  Ik heb er kostbare uren slaap voor opgepofferd     pageturner  A 4 5 rating The book is written in self narrative of three women in form of their diary entries  It is an interesting format  but makes it a little bit difficult to grasp what is happening in the beginning when the time stamps of the three women is drastically different  It truly confuses the reader   I myself went forwards and backwards a several times  But once you get the hang of the events and their occurrence  you will manage to sail through easy So  once you re into the story   it s a fast paced  nail biting mystery  Towards the middle of the book  I felt like I am not reading fast enough   as the suspense build up was so strong that you just wanted to know who killed the lady  but there were too many loose ends to be tied before you could get to the centre of the whole mystery It s a very nicely woven plot  the way the lives of the three women has been interlinked is so smooth  The suspense factor is great too as you cannot nail down one person   who is the murderer  you keep jumping the suspicion from one person to another as the story moves ahead and then back But once the culprit is revealed  the story doesn t end quickly making it a bit of a drag towards the end  Despite that  the end is quiet unexpected Leaving aside the two factors of the story  it being confusing in the beginning and a drag at the end  the reason for a 4 5 rating and not a 5 0 rating   it is a great read  A complete page turner which won t leave you disappointed rather wanting to know   what next  So pick it up and get ready for a roller coaster ride as you move through the lives of the three women  There s a very delicious underlying tension to Paula Hawkins  debut  The Girl on the Train  In a way  it s very subtle that it makes everything mysterious I think the novel s strength isn t really the twists and turns of its plot  but just that underlying intensity  that psychological battle illustrated by the three completely unreliable narrators  The intensity  the uncertainty all translate from the pages and provide you with this tiny feeling of anxiety and curiosity  where you want to know what s exactly going on  I think it also helps that the characters are in a way unlikable  they re all morally wrong in certain aspects  Their undiluted immoral thoughts and actions present you with lots of doubts about their roles in the story  It presents the question of how exactly can you trust the judgement of a character when you know that they re morally corrupt  Basically  how well can I trust you if you re always lying or cheating or doing something that s clearly wrong  view spoiler  and you see this clearly illustrated with how the police take Rachel s testimonies  hide spoiler    So what does Hawkins really invite us to do with this novel  She lets us be the judge  jury and the executioner  as only we know what exactly goes on in the minds of these three protagonists  She weaves her tale in a slow pace  building up anxiety  allowing the reader to come up with their own decisions  conclusions on the outcome of the plot  She gives you unfettered access to the minds of her characters  You know their thoughts  and though the timelines and incomplete pieces of the plot are there to deter you from your path of judgement  you can start to decide exactly what kind of characters she creates  Are they good  Are they bad  What makes them the way they are  Is it their desires  Speaking of desires  can one truly go after what they want without taking into account the consequences it might have on others  Most importantly do your desires shape and mould you  Who are you really  What makes you  The Girl on the Train is a delicious gripping thriller that keeps your mind active and guessing on where exactly the train story is going to turn   Five star story  four star writingOne of these  can t put down  books  the only reason for four star rating is that it can be a bit disjointed between the three women s stories  Perhaps a plot device  to keep the reader frenzied and confused  but it borders on distracting  i wasn t sure i d like this but i ripped through 90  of it in a day  very good  I know others have made comparisons to gone girl but I m sick of those comparisons so I wont do that   Rachel is an alcoholic  She has lost her job because of her drinking but she still takes the same train every morning and evening because she doesn t want anyone to know  Every day the train stops at the same spot beside a row of houses  From there she observes the same couple everyday  Jess and Jason  She imagines scenarios between the two  They are the perfect couple  Jess and Jason Except Jason and Jess are not their real names and their lives are far from perfect  One day she witnesses  Jason  with a woman who is not  Jess   Her perfect vision is shattered  A vision which she relied upon after the breakdown of her own marriage Shorty after this incident she finds out that Jess   whose real name is Megan  is now missing  She becomes obsessed with the investigation as she feels connected to the two  The story moves between several different characters but its held together well and it certainly kept me guessing  Almost all of the characters are suspects and honestly couldn t hazard a guess at who actually committed the crime  Overall its a well thought out and very believable story  The writing is convincing and gripping enough to make you keep turning the pages  I have a feeling we will see this on the big screen in a few years   Great  quick readThis was a great read  finished in a couple days as it really kept my attention  It felt a bit obvious but it was still enjoyable   4 5 stars  really  This was one of those books that sucks you in  This  along with Big Little Lies  has broken my reading dry spell  great writing  couldn t put it down  but I the characters are all so unlikable  khoroshii povil nii britans kii detektiv  z psikhologichnimi niuansami  Vsim zhinochim geroiam   z perspektivi iakikh i

version of Gone Girl with sections that bored me and went on for too long   This is a 4 1 2 for me  I loved this book and found it annoying  all at the same time  I love how the narrator is portrayed  wonderful twist on my old favorite of the unreliable narrator  or is she  or hmmm  I did figure out quite early who the murderer was  and that is OK   and I did figure out quite early another one of the twists  part of the how unreliable is she part  but again that is fine  Nicely done shifts in POV  and I am not certain I ve ever observed another book organized in this style  The author has each section marked with not only dates but morning and evening  Every section marked with name of character  date  and morning and then a section for evening  Clever  I highly rec this book  3 5 StarsTL DR  I couldn t put it down  One of those had to know what was going to happen next kind of books  Everyone in book club liked it  This book is definitely this year s version of  Gone Girl   It was a fun fast read  and I liked it   but it s not something that has any re read value  The  who done it  reveal at the end was obvious from midway through  But still   it was a decent entertaining read   Decent book  A bit too much at some points  but still pretty good   I enjoyed this one  What a relief  I expected to hate it as much as I did Gone Girl  Here although the main narrator was unreliable in that she drank very much to excess and couldn t remember things  I liked her and hoped things turned out well for her  Again  unlike GG  I didn t figure out until relatively late in the book who the bad person was  There was a fairly high level of tension as things began to be discovered and also tension revolving around Rachel s continual back sliding with the drink  I felt like the plot was reasonable and the writing was clear and the characterization was well done  You really routed for Rachel to dry out and figure out what was going on and eventually move on with her life  I don t know if it really deserves all the hype it s recieved  It s not another Gone Girl  as has been implied by other reviews  but I thought the story was intriguing and entertaining  I don t want to be an alcoholic  I m giving this 4 stars  but I m rounding up   I really think it deserves 3 8 stars  It was such a page turner  and very exciting  Also  I am the type of person who sometimes sees strangers pass and thinks about the lives they live  so I enjoyed that aspect of this story as well  Idid figure out the mystery by about page 250   but I kept on wanting to read to confirm my idea  which was 100  correct   and because I enjoyed the writer s style of writing very much  I did feel a little like shouting at the characters by the end of the book   you know the way you do to horror movie characters  Don t go in there   or  Run Away  NOW   but of course they couldn t hear me  and so the ending scenes identify the book as a thriller  I would recommend the book because I didn t skim any of it  I liked the style and enjoyed the plot  Not the best book I ve ever read  but still good  I would definitely read another book by the same author in the future   I m blown away by this debut novel  It s was intriguing and suspenseful and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end  I was utterly confused at the very beginning but this author does a beautiful job at building the layers of this story and piecing it all together as the story progresses  As I got deeper and deeper into the book  slowly each detail and the meaning behind it  clicks into place  But just when you think you have it all figured out  you realize you don t  It s not an explosive conclusion but one that will have you affirming your suspicions no matter how fleeting they were  If you liked Gone Girl  you will love this book   The Review  http   thefictionalhangout blogspot c     Rachel catches the same commuter train every morning  She knows it will wait at the same signal each time  overlooking a row of back gardens  She s even started to feel like she knows the people who live in one of the houses   Jess and Jason   she calls them  Their life   as she sees it   is perfect  If only Rachel could be that happy And then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough Now everything s changed  Now Rachel has a chance to become a part of the lives she s only watched from afar Now they ll see  she s much more than just the girl on the train    One of my favourite movies of 2014 was David Fincher s Gone Girl  a superb thriller that I d recommend to anyone  Whilst I still haven t yet read the book  something that I intend to remedy this year   when I saw that The Girl on the Train was being compared to Gone Girl  I leapt at the chance to request it when it appeared on NetGalley and as it turned out  it did not disappoint  turning out to be an excellent start to 2015 releases and something that rightly deserves the label as the next Gone Girl  It s that good The Girl on the Train is an interesting thriller that will grab ahold of you and not let you go  Whilst Gone Girl raises the question that your other half might not be who you think they are  The Girl on the Train looks at your fellow human beings  At a passing glance  they look average  ordinary  mundane  People living normal lives and doing normal things  But what if they re not  What if there s something that they re just not telling you  The Girl on the Train explores this concept in great detail and will make you look twice at the people on your regular commute to work school wherever This was one of those books that when I got stuck into it  I could not put it down  It s a definition of a page turner with that one more chapter feel lingering on the book  If you read one  you ll want to read another  Mixed with its three unreliable narrators   all female  all flawed   the book balances the aspect of the thriller with its developed cast  There s Rachel  an alcoholic  and then there s Anna and Megan  who both have interesting perks of their own  They re certainly a welcome change of narrator to those thrillers that feature a sole male lead Detective hunting after a serial killer  and that s in part why The Girl on the Train  despite the obvious Gone Girl comparisons  feels fresh and exciting  And above all  unpredictable  with several enthralling twists and turns Rachel is the main narrator of the three and the only one mentioned on the blurb  so as expected  she gets the main portion of the book  although that said it is all written in first person with plenty of time spent between her  Anna and Megan  She s picturing the lives of these two people who she sees on the train each morning  imagining out to be better than hers  Giving them names that she knows that they can t be their real ones and letting the story play out from there  Until something bad happens  and that s when the book really kicks in Even though the ending may not be the strongest moment of the book  everything leading up to it is great  The small amount of characters works in the book s favour and the first person narrative for all of them won t really be confusing because the personalities are enough to distinguish who is who  also  the chapter titles are listed for each character   The blend in pace between each narrator also works  with Rachel s moving a lot quicker than Megan s story does  In another book  it would feel jarring and out of place  but with The Girl in the Train  Hawkins uses it to her advantage The Girl on the Train is a very good way to start a year  I think  Whether it remains being one of the best novels of 2015 at the year s end remains to be seen  but it certainly delivers a good impression right out of the gate as the first novel from this year that I ve read  Also as a word of advice  you ll probably get the most out of this book if you read it on the train  VERDICT  8 5 10 This was a captivating mystery which all begins with the presumptions of  you guessed it  a girl on a train  It has all the elements of a good mystery  Lovers  murder  plot twists and a train  but it s genius is in the lesson that nothing is ever as it seems when viewing a story from only one angle  Perspective is everything  As I read  I was reminded of the importance of due process in our judicial system  and why current trends in  rush to judgement  sentencing via the internet are so dangerous  The omniscient perspective also gave pause as how perhaps God views our twisted interconnectedness with universal sorrow  Well damn  In the short ish time it took me to finish this book I think I became and now am a recovering alcoholic with a new taste for canned gin and tonic  This is really fast paced and really well written  I don t typically like multi perspective novels but this one had a way of keeping the chapter book feel  I don t think of gone girl much other than infidelity but I will say if I had to relate it to a gillian Flynn novel it would be dark places  multi perspective and a character named Libby   there were a few unanswered questions  or perhaps they were answered but not to my satisfaction you can t win them all really  I look forward to reading more from hawkins and I will be recommending and talking about this book for a very long time  First part of the book was a very boring to get through but the last 60ish pages were well worth it  The characters were not very good  and slightly predictable in a way  The ending definitely makes up for it though   I loved the writing style and chronology of the unfolding story  It was an addictive read  I was so engrossed one day on the tram I didn t notice the ticket inspector until a hand waved across my kindle  Having said that or perhaps because of this I was left disappointed with the end  Having so cleverly woven the threads of the story I felt the ending was clumsy not necessarily the outcome but its execution  probably leaning more towards 3 5 starsreally liked how flawed the characters were    this book was great but i think its inevitably forgettable  Thanks to e books allowing multiple readers of a publication  decided to read this at the same time as my wife where normally I would have to wait until she was done  or vice versa   Good story and would generally agree that it had a Hitchcock ian feel to it  Great set of characters and you see them in deep texture thanks to the 1st person narrative style used by the author  She switches from one voice to another so pay attention to whom is the narrator for each chapter  I was little careless initially and had to back up when I didn t catch the narrator switch   First  thriller  by the author and she does the genre justice  She s got a background writing  chick lit  and you sense a little of it here  but hope she can duplicate this effort  Utterly gripping  I raced through this in a couple of days  if I d had a weekend I probably wouldn t have stopped  The characters are all terrible  Well written  realistic  but terrrible  Drunks  homewreckers and just plain mean  However this didn t lessen my enjoyment of the book  I don t read a lot of thrillers  but I thoroughly enjoyed this and didn t guess the ending until I was meant to  Highly recommended  Predictable ending didn t spoil my enjoyment of this book  I couldn t put it down   Rachel is het meisje in de trein en zij reist ieder ochtend naar haar werk in Londen en  s avonds weer terug   Iedere dag hetzelfde saaie ritje met dezelfde saaie mensen  Iedere dag stopt de trein op welke reden dan ook bij een rijtje huizen in de buitenwijk van Londen  Hier heeft ze dan iedere dag een kijkje in andermans leven  Op een dag ziet ze in de tuin van Jason en Jesse  ze noemt het stel zo omdat ze de echte namen niet weet iets liggen  Ze gaat met dit gegeven naar de politie en dan komt ze in een zaak terecht waar ze niet in betrokken wilt en mag zijn Dit boek is het debuut van Paula Hawkins en heeft veel media aandacht gekregen  Het boek bleef me aandacht vasthouden ondanks al deze aandacht en van A W Bruna kreeg ik het boek toegestuurd  Ondertussen had ik me wel al voor genomen om me niet te laten beinvloeden door alle aandacht die het kreeg In het begin moest ik wel erg wennen aan de vrouwelijke personages en haalde ze ook nog weleens door elkaar  Ondanks dat er bovenaan het hoofdstuk vermeld stond om welke personage het gaat  Megan het tweede verhaallijn in dit boek speelt zich af in het verleden maar wat hebben die twee verhaallijnen met elkaar gemeen     Paula heeft de vrouwelijke personages ieder een eigen stijl gegeven en dit is ook te merken aan de schrijfstijl tussen de personages  Zeker in het begin had ik totaal geen idee welke kant het verhaal op zou gaan  Ik vond dat het zeker in het begin wat duister en wazig  Maar gaande weg het verhaal werd het verhaal duidelijker maar toch werd ik menigmaal verrast door een wending in het verhaal die het steeds boeiender maakte om te weten hoe het eigenlijk allemaal in elkaar zou steken en wat nu de waarheid is     Niets wordt er te vroeg prijsgegeven van het plot integendeel zelfs  Spanning wordt opgevoerd en dit is ook te danken aan de personages die allemaal zo hun eigen stempel op het verhaal weten te drukken en te behouden Het boek leest vlot en is boeiend tot op het einde Het heeft me enorm verbaasd dat dit een debuut is   Kwaliteit straalt het uit en ben zeer benieuwd naar haar volgende thriller en naar de groei van haar schrijfkunsten  There was more than one moment in this book that had me on the edge of my seat or saying  What     The main character was a train wreck and I was determined not to like her  The only reason I didn t give the book five stars was that I had a hard time determining who was talking at times  There was quite a bit of date jumping and so I found that annoying difficult on an e reader  Overall   Great Story  Really happy that I read it as a book club selection   we had super discussion about it   There is a girl on the train  Same train  every morning  Watching out the window  inspecting the scenery  looking at unknown people  Every day  Until she starts noticing a couple  The same couple on their deck  drinking coffee  kissing or just sitting  Then what is unknown becomes familiar and when the woman goes missing  Rachel  just has to help the police because what she saw from the train may be the answer they re seeking A girl on a train  How many times have you got on a bus or a train  following the same route to work or to school  Don t tell me that you haven t noticed those who are around you  don t tell me that you haven t took a peek out of the window A woman buried by the train tracks  old clothes tossed aside  Rachel s story drew me in from the moment I started reading  Her recounting was so vibrant  emanating pain  misery and I knew before she told me that she was a troubled woman  So I was more than excited to meet her and Megan  the woman on the deck  even if I knew she would go missing  I was longing for her story too To my surprise the story is told by different POVs  We see Rachel  her complicated life and her obsession about Megan  But we also see Megan s POV  but a year earlier  So you understand how tension builds up  We follow the events  unfolding back and forth in time which is exciting  Later in the book there is another female narrator adding her parts of reality to the story  And the thing is that everybody lies There are secrets  hidden secrets  some known only to certain people and others we have to figure out ourselves  So the image we get while reading the book is as fuzzy as the scenery before us while the train moves fast and away  Blurry letters on the page  that s how it is  And I absolutely loved it There is a certain appeal in damaged characters that I can t really put a name on it  They emanate a mystery waiting to be solved  but mostly  I believe  is the promise of salvation  Can we really get close to the edge and don t fall  That s the human nature  pushing ourselves to the limits and if we survive  then it s another projection of ourselves we pull back from the emptiness Enjoy the quotes  And read the book  One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl  four for a boy  five for silver  six for gold  seven for a secret never to be told I ve got a few of those   Hollowness  that I understand  I m starting to believe that there isn t anything you can do to fix it  That s what I ve taken from therapy sessions  the holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mould yourself through the gaps  All these things I know  but I don t say them aloud  not now   I don t want to give anything away  The story is compelling  but hard to read  I kept going  but didn t want to  I knew early on how it would play out because of the character so thinly developed  and I wondered why  My favorite part of the writing  the voices  Oh those voices  those women that I wanted to yell at and hug all at the same time  Others have disliked it  others have praised it  Haven t you always imagined things going on behind a window as you walk in the evening  The story of Rachel begins with her view as she sits on the commuter train  watching as her old neighborhood goes by  Her state of mind makes things imaginary become real  and so the story begins  with Jess and Jason  a love Rachel sees as something she s lost  something to gain back  Paula Hawkins has had Rachel throw that pebble into the pond  and the ripples widen and widen  It s quite a story  Excellent   The reviews on this book are mixed  And it is very similar indeed to Gone Girl  even if the author did start writing it before that book was published  So that sort of bothered me However  I could not put this one down  I read it in two days flat  This is a real page turner  Rachel lives a sad broken life  taking the train every day into and out of London  Living vicariously through the lives of the people she spys out the train window  one day she sees something that she cannot forget  She decides to get involved And then the trouble begins In part a treatise on alcoholism and personal responsibility and partly a glimpse into all sorts of behavioral illnesses and memory  this book goes in many different directions at once and seems chaotic until all the parts suddenly converge with devastating results  Some beautiful commentary on what it means to be a woman and what we use to define our worth   both from men and regarding motherhood   makes this a killer of a book     Unreliable narrator done well  Can t tell you much without spoilers  So you are going to have to believe me when I tell you that although substantially different from  Gone Girl  this thriller will have you just as caught up in it s intricately woven web  I don t read a lot of thrillers  but a good one is a great bit of escape reading for me  Alcohol and memory are important elements in this story  If you like psychological thrillers  I would say this one is for you  Schon lange wollte ich dieses Buch lesen  allerdings auf Englisch   und war mir dann doch nie ganz sicher  ob es mir wirklich gefallen wurde  Als ich dann schliesslich sah  dass  Girl On The Train   hurra ubrigens  dass der Titel beibehalten wurde   auch auf Deutsch erscheint  KONNTE ich nicht mehr widerstehen  Und ich wurde nicht enttauscht Man muss gestehen  dass dieser Roman  und ich mochte deutlich darauf hinweisen  dass es ein Roman ist und kein Thriller  vermutlich nicht Jedermanns Sache ware  Denn der Erzahlstil ist eher nuchtern und ruhig  Man spurt  dass die Geschehnisse auf eine Katastrophe zulaufen  nahert sich dieser jedoch in langsamen Schritten  Denn  und das macht in diesem Fall den Unterschied zu einem Thriller aus  es geht darum  die kaputten Personlichkeiten der Charaktere kennenzulernen und weniger um atemberaubende Spannungsmomente  Die Charakteristika eines Thrillers sind teilweise durchaus vorhanden  doch ich fand es auch sehr interessant zu beobachten  in welche  abgrundige  Richtung das Leben sich manchmal entwickeln kann   ob man nun will oder nicht  Schade fand ich ein wenig  dass ich ab einem gewissen Zeitpunkt zu grossen Teilen ahnte  was hinter den Geschehnissen steckte  doch das konnte meinem positiven Gesamteindruck keinen grossen Schaden zufugen Ich bin froh  dass ich mich endlich dafur entschieden habe  dieses Buch zu lesen  This is a good thriller  The next Gone Girl  Not quite  in my opinion    This book was so good  The writing was amazing  and though I had some trouble getting into the story  I enjoyed every minute of reading   nao foi o que esperava  a escrita e a forma como estava escrito relembrou me do Dark Places da Gillian Flynn  que nao foi exatamente o meu livro favorito  gostei deste livro  mas achei um bocado meh  tho nao tenha previsto logo o plot  acho que demorou muito e continha muitas coisas que nao eram necessarias  gostei da Rachel e do percurso dela como personagem  percebo a hype  mas para mim nao foi extraordinario tho tenha gostado da historia em si e me tenha relacionado um pouco visto que devido a universidade  ando muito de comboio  Great mystery  I had not read any fiction in a while and I was not disappointed  Some language and inappropriate content for young readers  but other than that a really good book   This was the first book I ve read where there are three lead female characters and all are flawed and messy in every way possible  Each monologue felt so real  so raw and  un pretty   The story itself kept me laying in bed at night wondering where Megan was and if this was going to be another Gone Girl  in London  However  it was not like Gone Girl  instead it was this unique story  with characters intertwined in a cluster fuck of everyday struggles to be human  Lies  deceit  murder  babies  alcoholism  and love  Paula Hawkins executes these intriguing theme with time jumps  perspective variation and plot twists  I recommend this book to anyone seeking a thrill and some truly screwed up people to invest your life in  I  of course mean this in the most enticing way possible   This was a gripping page turner that kept me up late into the night to finish it  Set outside of London  Rachel takes the train to and from work every morning  Rachel is a heavy drinker and as she spirals into uncontrollable alcoholism  her world unravels  She is newly divorced  Rachel becomes obsessed with a  perfect  couple whose garden backs up to the train track  Twice a day  when the train stops at that particular stop  she sees this perfect couple and imagines what their lives may be like  Then she witnesses something tragic and becomes obsessed with finding answers  But her alcoholic brain gets in the way  What really happened   Like a train wreck you can t take your eyes away from  Pun intended  I completely ignored my children in favor of reading this and finished it in 24 hours  Thought I had it figured out too  but no   You see so much riding on a train everyday  Familiar faces  Familiar places  People s homes  You catch a glimpse of their lives  The lives of those just off the tracks  Like Rachel  Rachel drinks too much and too often  She s ashamed of what she s done but even more ashamed of what she can t remember  Then there s Anne  Anne has taken Rachel s place in life  literally  She s taken her husband and her home  Down the street you ll find Megan  who tries to maintain as normal a life as possible  But she just can t seem to shake her demons  Hawkins does a really good job formatting the stories  the way they are set and intertwine is really good  It tends to get a bit confusing when it starts unravelling  but overall  very good  Lo he acabado y OMG     Debo reconocer que me costo muchisimo engancharme porque las primeras 20 paginas estaba totalmente perdida en la historia  pero conforme todo va avanzando vamos conociendo a Rachel y a los demas protagonistas  Nos vamos metiendo en su cabeza y vamos entendiendo  o no  sus acciones  El final fue buenisimo y a pocas hojas de acabar estaba ansiosa por saber como terminaria esta historia  Definitivamente esta super recomendada  This book was a very thrilling tale  It totally had me enthralled with the curiousity of this intising mysterious web that Paula Hawkins weaved  This is the first novel I ve read of Hawkins  I really enjoyed it until the ending  as the ending of the book I though it could ve been better  The plot was good   the characters I got mixed feelings about them throughout the story  I can t quite say that they re relatable or at least in my opinion  I would recommend anyone to

because its the best thriller which is released in this year  In the first few chapters the author s writing is inspired me a lots  I read the book which have the similar writing style GOT   still I m inspired This book evolves around 2 pair s life  sometimes feels like very complicated too  Rachel  Tom s ex wife travels in the same route in train which stops in a same place for a signal  There  she used to see a happy couple Scott and Megan  who are living near to tracks  They are happy  always together sitting in the balcony  Rachel admired them  wanted to live with her ex like them Rachel s ex  Tom lives near to the Scott family  Tom is very happy with his wife Anna  child Evie  Rach is alcoholic  always drinks whenever she is free  Once she drinks  she won t remember anything  One day  when the train stops  Rachel saw Anna is kissing passionately a guy  not Scott  Rachel is shocked  broken on seeing this  On the same day s night  Anna is missing  The day she went missing  Anna drinks and came to meet his ex  In the next day  Anna was in her flat  with lot of wounds  The police tries to frame Scott for Anna s disappearance  Rachel alone knew that they are happy and she had relation with someone else  Rachel is desperately trying to help Scott by remembering what happens when she visited near their place This book never lay the clues to find the criminal  Until last few chapters  It never unveils the truth  Coming to the characters  Rachel is framed as very pitiful one  The love failure people can relate lot of their thinking with Rachel Totally  Its not a feel good book  but an entertaining thriller  Kesinlikle diyebilecegim ilk sey bu kitabin  talihsiz  oldugudur  Bir kere karsisinda tapindigim Gone Girl gibi bir rakibi vardi  Ben de bunu frsat bilip tum kitap boyunca surekli ikisini karsilastirdim ve bunu yaparken buyuk bir keyif aldim  hatta kendimi durduramadim  Argh  Gercekten buyuk talihsizlik  Yine de kesinlikle hakkini vermek lazim  Karanlik atmosfer  kusursuz cinayet  creepy karakterler zinciri ve elbette sonu tam olmasi gerektigi gibiydi  Bir ara bu yazar cildirmis olmali diye bile dusunmustum  Okurken buyuk keyif aldim  Simdi filmini bekliyorum anacim  galp Ayrica neden 1 puan kirdigimi anlatmaliyim ve bunu yaparken Gone Girl ile kiyaslayacagim  Elbette  ESSEK KADAR SPOILER BUNDAN SONRASI xD  Gone Girl de suclu    bize yazar tarafindan kitabin daha yarisindayken verilmisti  Bu nasil olabilirdi  Bizim merak etmemiz gereken sey bu degil miydi zaten  Bundan sonrasini  yani her seyi  bilirken nasil kitaptan keyif alabilirdik ki  Degilmis iste    Yazar mindfucklarin kralini yasatti  Bu kitap hala benim biricigim  3  Trendeki Kiz da ise yazar gecmiste okudugum turdas kitaplarin izinden giderek sucluyu son bilmem kac sayfada bize imalarla buldurtmaya calisti  Ama asil amaci  Vuaaaaa demek suclu oymus   nidalari attirmakti  Gel gor ki daha kitabin basinda suphelendigim tek insanin suclu cikmasi canimi sikmisti  Bir puan kirdim ben de canim  O kadarcik da olsun hani  3 The very last scene of the book left me with chills  This book was a nail biter  I mean even though I figured out the culprit early on  but it didn t diminish the experience for me  The author had me second guessing myself  The characters are unbelievably flawed  There s nothing to love about any of them  They would make great character case study  You think you know them  but then a couple pages later  you re like wtf   If you re a fan of Gone Girl  I highly recommend this book  It s not too drawn out as Gone Girl so that s always a plus      If you re looking for romance  look elsewhere  Happy reading  The concept of a girl who commutes to London daily on a train  and who gets a vicarious thrill of watching the lives of people inside these houses  is quite creative  We learn soon enough that she actually has an agenda when she becomes embroiled in their lives and sets in motion a series of events that lead to dire consequences  I thought the story line to be very strong  however the interior dialogue written for three of the women players in this drama is identical  I had to check back as I was reading to remind myself whose head I was in  That said  the book held my interest to the very end   I won t be the first nor the last to say so  but of all the books that have purported to be the next Gone Girl  this is the one that best taps into the varied appeals of that story  The bits of history that are strategically revealed  the characters that treat themselves almost as badly as they do each other  the competing unreliable perspectives  the red herrings  the staccato pacing  the compounding of conflict  and the collateral damage    all are represented here  and not in a copycat way  As a longtime commuter  I was ripe for the premise  and though the themes were dispiriting  to say the least   it is an exciting ride My next book needs to be one in which not all people are horrible audiobook note  It is the high quality narration which tips this review to a fourth star  In print  it would still have the tense  can t look away  twisty qualities  but the talented readers bring out the touches of humanity  flawed as the characters indisputably are  in the three points of view  I was especially taken with Clare Corbett as Rachel and Louise Brealey  Sherlock s Molly Hooper   as Megan  who are equally excellent  India Fisher s Anna was a bit grating  but that may actually be to the narrator s credit  given the character beats with which she had to work  All in all  a riveting listen   Really Good easy book to read  I enjoyed it 4 5 Trust no one  Stars     Life is not a paragraph  and death is no parenthesis    If you want to read a gripping mystery psychological thriller that will blow your mind  this is the book for you  Well written with a very well done plot   The Girl on the Train  is told from multiple  three  POVS  I love a dual POV and I also love a multiple POV if it s well done and necessary  And here it really was  I liked to be in these characters  minds  In my opinion the author did a really great job with the three character s voices  All three of them felt unique and like me you will experience so  so many feelings reading their story  While they were interesting  I can t say I liked any of them  But it was ok  I don t expect to like all the characters I read about and here the reader is not meant to like them  All of them are flawed  all of them have insecurities and fears and because of that all of them felt real and in some way even relatable  I liked the pace of the story  At times the story was slow paced and I think for some readers it will be a little boring  but sometimes the story was so fast paced and intriguing  Needless to say  the pace of the story really worked for me  Rachel the main character of the story is very well developed and even if I didn t like her too much I sympathize with her  As for the other two important women in this story  I really liked how they are portrayed  For me the most intriguing character was  view spoiler  Tom  if you read the book you will figure out why   hide spoiler   The plot is complex  layered and the suspense is fantastically done  The story is told from first pov and IMO the author did a great choice writing this novel in this way  Obviously since this is a mystery psychological thriller there are many twists and turns and most of them I didn t see them coming  I really don t want to give too much away  because this is a book you need to experience for yourself  but I will tell you this   the story will keep you guessing and I m pretty sure you will not be able to put it down All in all   The Girl on the Train  was a great engaging suspenseful read that for sure will keep you at the edge of your seat  Recommended read     One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl  four for a boy  five for silver  six for gold  seven for a secret never to be told  I ve got a few of those       I hesitated buying this book due to all the hype it has received and the comparisons to Hitchcock as well as comparing it to a Gillian Flynn book  Books with this much hype  rarely live up to it  and I figured this book would be no different  but when I was at Barnes   Noble and between it being on sale  my member discount  and a coupon I think I got 60  off and figured at that price it was worth it  It turns out it was well worth it For a first time book it was very good  The story flows well the only similarity to Gillian Flynn is that this book is also told in the past and present and from multiple viewpoints  The outline on the book flap is accurate a girl on a train sees something out of the ordinary and that unleashes a number of events  The reason the book doesn t get five stars is that it is really hard to sympathize or want to root for any of the main characters  each is morally  emotionally  or psychologically bankrupt in one way or another  but for a first book it kept my attention  kept me wanting to Finnish the story  even though the reader will likely figure out the perpetrator of all that goes wrong  at least by half way through the book  but it is doubtful the reader will understand the why until the very end which is why the book works It will be interesting to see what this author does next  I had to marinate on this one a few days  I liked it  I really did  Good storytelling  good narrative writing  characters I both loathed and sympathized with at the same time  which is tough to do   and an excellent sense of place and atmosphere  A solid mystery with a bow that tied a little too neatly for my liking And that s where it misses on that  5 star  element for me  I want to finish a thriller feeling a bit gobsmacked by what just happened  I want a little messiness  a feeling of WTF  I don t even mind a few loose ends  things to think about when it s over  that sense of  what would be on the next page if this hadn t ended   I felt that with Gone Girl  Kind of like  oh man  what is going to happen NOW   and I thought about the characters for days  Note I didn t say I LIKED the characters  In  Girl     it was difficult to find a character to root for  By the time Rachel got some chutzpah  she had already annoyed me for 300 pages  Here  within the last 50 or so pages  the whole story became clear  and what I didn t already guess  the killer handed over on a silver platter  Those sociopaths sure like to talk  Rather than there being some huge revelation of OMG  at the end  I realized a bunch of whiny  self absorbed boring people had all basically screwed each other  Again  that isn t necessarily a negative review  just an expectations v  reality observation So I don t know   I recommend it as a good read  But don t go into it hoping for a hero or a heart pounding thrill ride of a roller coaster  It ended up for me feeling just like a commuter train trudging along  filled with crazy people and people who would rather be anywhere else  back and forth  same route  same mistakes  same view  over and over and over      The Girl on the Train  is one of 2015 s most popular books  Sometimes I feel the need to seek out the biggest bestsellers not because they sound particularly interesting to me but rather because I want to know what everybody s reading and why  So  why did Paula Hawkins  debut novel  The Girl on the Train  become such a huge success  Well  I don t know  exactly  As much as we d like to think there s a science to these things  there really isn t  But it helps that the book is good Rachel is a depressed alcoholic with holes in her memory  She rides the train every day to create the illusion that she still has a job  On one of the stops that brings her close to her ex husband s home  Rachel stares out the train s window at a happy couple  She has named them Jason and Jess and she dreams up all sorts of scenarios of their happy life  Rachel lives in fantasies  dreaming about other people s joy because she has none of her own  One day  she spots Jess with another man  and all those fantasies fall apart  When Jess   real name Megan   soon goes missing and is presumed dead  Rachel takes it upon herself to investigate  because she knows about the other man  But Rachel s not looking to help so much as she is looking for something to do  She wants   needs   to be a part of something bigger  something more  So  she weasels her way into other people s lives  creating lies about how she knew the missing Jess Megan  in an attempt to feel useful again The book is told in first person from three different points of view  Rachel  Megan  and Anna the woman who stole away Rachel s husband and lives the happy life she always wanted  Every character s voice is different from the last and one never feels lost with the shifting first person POV  It s really well written  Perhaps most interestingly is that these different narratives are nonlinear  making the story into puzzle with a few pieces missing until the most opportune moment  This format is especially useful for creating tension as we come to the end and certain secrets are revealed  In fact  I d say that the book s finale is the best part  as the truth of the past comes to light at the same time that the characters in the present teeter on the edge of life and death I was struggling with something for most of the book but by the end I was sure of it  I don t like anyone in this story  Not really  Everyone s a liar  a cheat  and in some cases violent and malicious  Megan s cheating on  Jason   Rachel says she s trying to do the right thing but she s doing it for all the wrong reasons  Anna is mean spirited and ugly  and almost all the men are controlling or potentially violent  I liked Rachel most out of the group because it s clear she has issues and can t always help herself  But I wouldn t ever want to know these people My Goodreads friend Alejandro compared  The Girl on the Train  to Alfred Hitchcock s  Rear Window  and  The Lady Vanishes   I had the exact same thought while reading the book  Like  Rear Window   our Rachel views something from afar and only has a few of the necessary pieces to the mystery  but she can t stop herself from getting involved  And like  The Lady Vanishes     there s a train and a lady vanishes  In a lot of ways  I think  The Girl on the Train  would ve made a good Hitchcock film  I think it works better as a mystery than it does as a thriller  personally   Perhaps it s worth noting that I read more thrillers than I do mysteries   The twists in the mystery are unpredictable and I can honestly say that I didn t see the end coming  If you want to call it a thriller  then I d say that the tension could ve been ramped up a bit  But as a whodunit   The Girl on the Train  is solid  The Girl on the Train  is an impressive debut  It ll be interesting to see where Hawkins goes next  What happens when you put the thoughts of three detestable women in a book  and add a crime to the mix  If you are thinking disaster you would be wrong  It s like the bad accident that you can t look away from  It made me feel bad about myself because I have to admit  it brought out the worst in me  I felt like someone who is peaking into another person s life  to see their misery and secretly feel good about himself  I feel like the slime won t go of   This one had me at the edge of my seat and I could not wait to find out what happened at the end  This fast paced mystery  set in England  was a great first read for 2016  Although  the plot became pretty predictable  it was engaging to the end and makes one wonder if they ever really  know another person   Rachel ist eine unter Tausenden von Pendlern  die taglich im Grossraum London mit dem Zug unterwegs sind  Jeden Morgen und jeden Abend fahrt sie dabei an einem Haus vorbei  in dem ein junges Parchen wohnt  das sie gerne beobachtet und um sein scheinbar gluckliches  sorgloses Leben beneidet  Rachel hatte auch gerne einen Mann  der sie liebt  und ein schones Zuhause  Stattdessen lebt sie  mehr geduldet als alles andere  seit ihrer Scheidung im Haus einer Freundin und ist zu einem ubergewichtigen Trauerkloss mutiert   wobei Ubergewicht und Niedergeschlagenheit bis an den Rand der Depression nicht einmal ihre einzigen Probleme sind  Den liebenden Mann und das schone Zuhause hat ihr Anna weggeschnappt  Anna  die schlanker  hubscher und erfolgreicher ist als Rachel und ihr den Ehemann ausgespannt hat Eines Tages ist die junge Frau  die sie so haufig auf der Terrasse oder im Garten gesehen hat  spurlos verschwunden  Die Polizei geht von einem Verbrechen aus  die Presse sturzt sich auf das merkwurdige Verschwinden der attraktiven Megan     und Rachel weiss etwas uber den Fall  doch die Ermittler nehmen sie nicht wirklich ernst An  Girl on the Train  kommt man diesen Sommer kaum vorbei  Und das zu Recht Dieser Thriller Bestseller ist kein blosser Marketing Hype  sondern in der Tat clever konstruiert und mitreissend geschrieben  Auf zwei Zeitebenen und aus drei Sichtweisen   Rachel  Megan und Anna   wirft die Autorin nach und nach diverse Puzzleteile des grossen Ganzen in den Raum und spielt dabei sehr geschickt mit Perspektivwechseln  die immer wieder dazu fuhren  dass man das  was man vermeintlich uber eine Figur oder ein Geschehnis zu wissen glaubte  vollig neu bewerten muss Die drei Hauptfiguren haben allesamt ihre charakterlichen Abgrunde und kommen beileibe nicht immer angenehm ruber  vor allem Anna war mir oft herzlich unsympathisch   doch ich fand sie bei allen Absonderlichkeiten  die zum Vorschein kamen  glaubwurdig  als konne man ihnen genau so in der Londoner U Bahn begegnen Das Buch ist kein klassischer Krimi und auch kein Thriller nach dem ublichen Schema  Um die polizeilichen Ermittlungen geht es nur am Rande  vielmehr stehen die Lebenswirklichkeiten und Gedankenwelten der Protagonistinnen im Mittelpunkt und immer wieder die Entdeckung  dass nichts ist  wie es scheint  und man niemand wirklich trauen kann Lobend erwahnen mochte ich zum Schluss noch die ausgezeichnete Ubersetzung von Christoph Gohler  Sehr gelungen  Wanted to see what all the fuss was about  and flew through it  It s a long time since I read so I didn t even notice the train had stopped and emptied   It was emotionally exhausting being in the minds of these women and their sufferings  and the varying mental states of the main character were really well drawn  I was quite willing to leave them all behind at the end  Just an aside about reading it on the Kobo  I couldn t  flick back  easily to compare the non linear dates of the entries which was a bit frustrating sometimes  After a while it didn t matter so much  I kept putting this off because of all the comparisons to Gone Girl  This was SO much better    Megan is still missing  and I have lied   repeatedly   to the police  It had to be something to do with Saturday night  I must have done something  I must have committed some terrible act and blacked it out Paula Hawkins  The Girl on the Train is a rare read  One to be obsessed about and contemplated when not in hand  and mourned on its completion  It is like a trip on the Express Line  fast and jolting  with an abrupt stop at the ride s end  Both exhilarating and infuriating in their actions  Hawkins  multiple narrators are unreliable  unlikeable  and yet somehow empathetic  You will not know who you are cheering for  or why  until the back cover closes  Rachel  a divorced alcoholic  takes the 8 04 commuter train to London every weekday  Only  Rachel isn t going to work  She hasn t worked in two months  Part cover so her roommate landlady won t learn of her unemployment  part obsession so that she can peer into the home along the line that she once shared with ex husband  Tom  and a desperate grasp at the normalcy that her alcoholic lifestyle is slowly stealing from her  Rachel s commute is a daily trip closer to utter disaster As Tom s life with his new wife  Anna  and their baby girl moves forward  Rachel s life moves backwards  She shifts her train window gaze from Tom and Anna s house to that of a  happy couple  four doors away  Rachel gives them imaginary names and projects all the hopes and dreams of her unfulfilled life onto these two complete strangers  However  when the  happy wife   whose real name is Megan  goes missing  Rachel may be the only one with a clue as to what may have happened to her Reminiscent of E  Lockhart s brilliant We Were Liars  and Christopher Nolan s movie  Memento  The Girl on the Train compels the reader to constantly question the truth  motivation and actions behind each and every character  And like it s often compared to predecessor  Gone Girl  it is a book whose characters and story you will not easily shake I m actually giving it a 4 5 out of 5 stars  After all the twists and turns of this wild ride  I found the ending rather predictable and lacking one last shock The Girl on the Train This book took me a little while to really get in to the story  Told from multiple points of view  the story is a little confusing to start  Rachel views the world from the windows of the commuter train she rides to and from work  She makes up lives for the people she sees  When a woman goes missing  Rachel becomes a very unreliable witness  even in her own eyes  How do past events change when viewed through a different lens  Lots of twists and turns as both the reader and Rachel realize the past isn t always what it looks like  The only reason I m giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is its slooooooooowness  justgetonwithit Seriously I really like a good mystery and a good build up with character development  but this dragged a bit too much Also  it was quite refreshing to read a story where you re not meant to like any of the characters  Megan was damaged and obsessive  Anna was a complete d    who I d just punch in the face  and Rachael just didn t do herself any favours   view spoiler  And Tom  I listened to this book  so as Tom was confessing his affair with Megan I was walking home from the train  LOL  and my face constantly looked like this  I would seriously like to spit on his face  His fictional character face    hide spoiler  The story was interesting though  even though I only got really hooked towards the final third  when things ACTUALLY happened   Foi bom  nao foi espectacular  E viciante e prende o leitor e as paginas desapareceram rapidamente  mas o final nao foi surpreendente  Nao foi previsivel tambem  foi apenas  adivinhavel   Teria recebido as cinco estrelas se me tivesse apanhado desprevenida  que e a melhor parte de um bom thriller  Para melhor livro de 2015 e explosao de vendas  confesso que esperava um pouco mais  E um livro facil de ler e diferente  no sentido que foge a cliches  e definitivamente um optimo livro para ler em comboio ou metro pelos capitulos curtos  mas nao e inovador  Consigo apontar um par de thrillers tao bons ou mais que nao sao records de vendas  Porque  Nao faco a menor ideia  Os melhores livros raramente estao nos tops  Ou entao talvez seja realmente dificil inovar e surpreender os leitores nos dias que correm Estamos a assistir a continuacao do fenomeno que Gillian Flynn mediatificou  que sao os herois com perfil anti heroico  com claros defeitos e vicios e as vezes repulsivos  mas que  nao obstante  conquistam o carinho dos leitores  E isso e bom  E bom ter novas vozes a contar historias  Ainda assim  confesso que na minha opiniao nao superou Flynn  Nao obstante  e um must read  mais nao seja para podermos opinar sobre o livro que toda a gente leu  I rounded up from 3 5 stars  I did enjoy this book  It may not have been the most riveting and complex thriller but it definitely kept me wanting to turn to the next page  I liked how Hawkins gradually provided several interesting and in some cases dramatic personal experiences in several of the main characters  pasts that helped me understand  while not necessarily justifying  the reckless  irresponsible  selfish things they did during the course of the story  SPOILER ALERTI m wondering a couple of things  For those who determined  who d done it  too early on   how early was it that you saw it coming  For me  the DNA not matching Scott or Kamal basically pointed to the only other possible male character in the book   Tom  I didn t think anything prior to that tipped me off at all and I didn t feel that was too early for the  reveal   I was still interested to find out how the whole story and especially the night of Megan s disappearance unfolded  My second question is this   did Megan also sleep with the psychiatrist  Hawkins dupes us into thinking that several of the events  attempted phone calls  conversations  trysts at the Swan  etc   were with Kamal  We come to find out that they were actually with Tom  But what about the passage  that is definitely Megan with Kamal  which says  I step forward  closing the gap between our bodies  stand on tiptoe and kiss his lips  He doesn t pull away from me    That led me to believe that Megan did also sleep with Kamal  But then later it seems that Megan is pretty certain that there are only two potential fathers of her baby   Scott and Tom  Without getting into a discussion about birth control   does Hawkins leave it to our own imaginations or did Megan and Kamal have sex  I m sure I could have missed something  so I m hoping to get some input  Very Gone Girl ish in the telling  a very good read  highly recommended  If this is just the author s debut novel  wow  I expect more fascinating thrillers down the road The characters are exceptionally believable  the storyline is plausible as well  For me  this was one of those books that you start to read faster and faster towards the end because you can t wait to see what s going to happen next This should be your next read   ktb rw dwst dshtm  dstn khyl   jyb w tzh nys wl  sbk nwshtn w twDyH dstn brm jdhb bwd  fqT yh dstn jny  w plys  nbwd  dr knrsh dsht bh mrzh  nsn hm shrh mykrd kh chTwr mytwnh  wD

continue the reading because it was such a page turner  Well  maybe it s the characters  There s no characters to root for  Rachel was not an easy to like character  She s a heavy drunker  have no self willpower  I m constantly want to slap her on the back  But then  maybe how the characters crafted was part of the charms Then I realized that I felt the ending was a bit off and sort of anti climax  In the end  there s not clear whether a certain person was convicted as murderer of Megan And to describe this story  there s Indonesian proverb says  the neighbor s grass always looks greener RECOMMENDED  nevertheless   Sucked me in from the start  Excellent characters  but Rachel wore on me  Biggest complaint is that at the beginning  Rachel and Megan had the same voice  So glad I didn t figure out what was what before the main character  Well played  Ms  Hawkins  Definitely worth another read  Soon  I HATE mysteries  Why  Because I have this need to know the ending now  and end up reading the book in one setting   The Girl on the Train  by Paula Hawkins was no different It has been classified in the same category as  Gone Girl  and I wouldn t put it there except to say you have an unreliable narrator  really three unreliable narrators   Hawkins created a fast paced narrative but did not have the  Wow Factor  of  Gone Girl   Rachel  an alcoholic takes the train into downtown London each day and in doing so passes the neighborhood in which she lived with her former husband  Her view of this place allows Rachel to see into what she perceives is a fantasy couple  that she calls Jason and Jess  They seem to have everything that Rachel does not One day Rachel discovers the identify of her fantasy heroine  Megan  Megan has gone missing  Rachel realizes that on her daily train ride she may have seen something that will provide a clue to Megan s whereabouts  The only problem  though is that Rachel s drinking often leads to black outs with large pieces of time missing In addition to Rachel  the reader is treated to the ideas of two more ladies who are also unreliable given to episodes of lying and cheating  So where is Megan  Hawkins treats the reader with a narrative that flows with action and characters that resemble real people  They are all flawed which makes guessing who done it that more difficult  This is a first novel for the author and I look forward to more to come  Do you ever think about the people around you  Sometimes  when I m out walking I make up stories about the people I see  I try to read their body language  to interpret what the little looks and pauses in their speech might mean  It s a more overt reading between the lines  I think everyone does it to some degree  especially on commutes where you re going to be seeing the same people every day  Most of us don t start to believe our fantasies  however  Most of us don t end up injecting ourselves into the other people s lives Rachel Watson  on the other hand  does just that Rachel s daily commute takes her past a certain house where she often sees the inhabitants out in the garden  She watches them  and the affection they show for one another  She makes up stories about what a wonderful life they must lead  All of her own wants and dreams are soon pinned on this ideal couple  until one day she sees the woman out with another man What on earth happened When the next day the woman goes missing  and Rachel can t remember just what she did the night before  the stage is set  The Girl on the Train has been touted as an answer to  Gillian Flynn s  Gone Girl  It s easy to see why the comparison exists  Both books play with time and perspective to further the mystery  Both books play  to some extent  with unreliable narration although I believe that  Paula Hawkins did a much better job of it  Both books deal with missing people  and deeply flawed individuals  I believe that where  The Girl on the Train succeeds is often where  Gone Girl failed   The Girl on the Train was  ultimately  more believable if only because it dealt with less manipulation and more flawed  normal  characters attempting to do what they believe to be the right thing The action starts from page one  as does the intrigue  If you can put the book down after hitting page 40 I d be deeply surprised  The writing style reminded me a great deal of  Patricia Highsmith  and I don t say that lightly  The book kept me guessing  turning back through the pages to double check dates  rushing forward to get to the conclusion  Right up until the final page the action didn t stop  It was an electric  riveting  train crash of a book I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to scratch that mystery itch  This is one of the good ones  This was a very well told mystery  using three different narrators in three different women  Solid recommendation to anyone who likes a good mystery novel  I could not put this down  Perfect pool side weekend read   Ah   Denne er  latterlig  lettlest  Jeg leste den norske versjonen  Ordene bare flyter avgarde og der er godt a bare vaere med pa mysteriet  Rachel tar samme toget til London hver dag og pa et fast stopp ser hun huset til Scott og Megan  Lager seg historier om livet dems  Sa ser hun noe som kan forandre alt  i bare de sekundene hvor toger star i ro  sa forandres alt  Ja  dette er virkelig en god bok  Spraket veier opp for historien  som har sine svakheter  Den fortelles av tre forskjellige kvinner i historien  enkelt a holde folge Definitivt en bok jeg kan anbefale  The unreliable narrator   witness is a mainstay of literary fiction  so a bitter alcoholic quasi stalker who drinks herself to blissful oblivion on an almost daily basis is probably not the most believable of witnesses turned investigators  However  as it turns out  the  heroine  of this tale  Rachel  turns out to be far more astute than you d first give her credit for She proves to be a very frustrating heroine  as her lapses as she tries to get sober are infuriating  however very real in the world of a recovering addict  It just makes it harder for other people to take her seriously  especially when you  the reader  know she s right There are some unnecessary deviations from the main plot  but on the whole  this is a real page turner as you follow Rachel into the recesses of her memory to try and find out what happened  formulating theories as crazy as her own along the way  I suspected several of the main characters at some point or other during the book  but as the pieces fall into place and the denouement reveals itself  it s a satisfyingly tense end to proceedings  A great thriller that will keep you guessing   Great twisted story  A suspenseful read  I could not put it down  Every time I thought I knew what was happening  I was wrong and another twist in the plot occurred  I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller  What a train wreck  My friends and I were out on a road trip when we decided to stay in a mall for a few hours  Of course  I had to go to the nearest bookstore and buy a book  this has become a habit   When I found this one  I thought   How expensive   and almost turned my back  Fortunately  I was pretty desperate to come home with a new book with me  and because I couldn t find one that I wanted to give a try  I bought my own copy of George Orwell s Animal Farm  though  but I kept thinking to myself that it wasn t enough   I picked this up  quite reluctant but happy For the next two days I committed myself to reading  It was a busy week  we had to catch up on countless projects before the screaming deadline lay its body upon our shoulders and mock us until even our own nightmares wish to leave  And indeed it slapped me on the face  non stop  telling me how stupid I was for reading such a useless book while my school work lay underneath my nose  utterly unnoticed But it s been quite a while since I read a book that s incredibly gripping and disturbing  It just happened that I had read online what would happen in the end so the entire journey was pretty lame  But that somehow didn t make the entire story less terrible  Terrible characters  terrible writing  I don t write good stuff myself  but I don t think I have to be an all time writer to know how excruciating it was to go through Hawkins  writing   and a terrible  oh  terrible  plot  What is there to ask for  The terrible stuff placed in this book is enough  I had sleepless nights and less conversations with people  These  I have proven  are just some of those happenings that imply that I am completely in love with a book I do not highly recommend this  But this surely is one hell of an entertainment  Two thumbs up for that  Devia ter escrito sobre este livro quando o acabei de ler  Nem sei porque nunca aconteceu porque o devorei e uso este termo de uma forma literal  Todas as minhas entranhas se revolveram a medida que o fui lendo e  como e evidente  o meu lado de fan boy de thrillers esteve sempre presente  Li o em Agosto  na minha semana de ferias no Verao  e nao podia ter escolhido melhor epoca  No momento em que estava mais descansado  a relaxar de todo o trabalho de escritorio Nao foi a toa que o burburinho sobre  A Rapariga no Comboio  comecou a espalhar se  Nao sei ate que ponto a escritora  a talentosa Paula Hawkins  estudou todos os classicos do genero policial mas conseguiu fazer um bom trabalho  Por puxar pelo quotidiano de grande parte dos leitores   as pessoas que encontram muito tempo para ler nos comboios  identificando se instantaneamente com o cenario do enredo   e saber criar um enredo tenso  de certa forma muito negro  Rachel  a protagonista  apanha todos os dias o comboio para disfarcar a tragedia e a miseria em que a sua vida se transformou  Com um divorcio nunca esquecido e sinais de depressao  observa as mesmas casas e os mesmos passageiros nas suas viagens  Mas  aos poucos  observa que algo de errado se passa com um casal que observa todos os dias  a janela do seu lugar no comboio  Todo o misterio comeca ai e agarra o leitor de uma maneira incrivel Espero que a Paula Hawkins regresse com algo tao aterrador como este livro  Sabe tao bem ler policiais bem escritos   I didn t like this book quite as much as many people seemed to  I felt like I was on to what was going on too soon and the ending wasn t a big shocker to me  That being said  I did finish it in a few days so that says something  An easy read that doesn t require a great amount of thought    A great book for reading with four kids as background noise   Reading through the reviews on Goodreads  you would think only women have read this book  Well  I ve read it too and it s a good one  It s true  women might find this more appealing a story than a man  the three protagonists are all women as well as the author  The plot alternates between their points of view  unwrapping the mystery of how the three characters are connected  This Rashomon  like device is a pretty effective way to tell this kind of well crafted thriller  It s riveting and suspenseful and in the end that s all one really wants from a book like this  an entertaining diversion  Actual Rating  4 75 5  Terrific  Review to follow  The character build up and the description of addiction is one of the best I have come across  She describes even the most normal of events with such detail that they are riveting and you can t put the book down  A well written psychological thriller that delves deep into three female characters dysfunctional situations and how their lives are truly connected  The novel started out a bit slow  but began to steam roll about half way through as the author started connecting the dots of Rachel  Megan and Anna and the continual lying  cheating and distrust from the people in their lives  Fast read  with a  Gone Girl  type ending that makes the reader keep guessing and wanting more   WARNING  This review may contain indirect spoilers Wow  what a whirlwind this book was  The entire book up until the last 5 7 chapters I was positive that it was Dr Abdic  But no  no  no that was the simple answer to the crime but the real answer was hidden away until I finally realized in the end who the killer was  There were points in the book that were gripping and held me on the edge of my seat so I would read a lot at a time  Yet  other times were extremely boring and repetitive especially when she was going through her alcoholic cycle of drinking and hangover day after day  I gave this book four stars because I thought it was great apart from the repetitiveness during the beginning before things started heating up  But once things did heat up  I was pretty hooked In regards to the movie that is coming out based on Girl on the Train  which comes out later this year I feel like it is going to be terrible  I am looking forward to watching the movie but I know that they will never be able to put in all of the twists and turns that this book has which makes it so interesting  Nevertheless  I know I will be going to see it anyway   _  I m hoping that Gone Girl hasn t become a new formula for debut thriller authors  I loved Gone Girl  but jeez   find your own style  This is similar to Gone Girl in many ways  It s written in the first person  is told by multiple characters  someone disappears  e v e r y o n e  in the book is F  d up some to the point of being mentally ill  no one is likable and the author doles out a little at a time to reel you in   people seem normal to begin with and then she reveals slowly they re seriously twisted  All of them  Hawkins leads you from character to character thinking  this is the culprit   only to lead you on to the next character  It wasn t a little like Gone Girl  it was A LOT like Gone Girl But I m giving it four stars for the pure entertainment value  It s cleverly written and while the first 100 pages were slow for me  I flew through the last 2 3  It s like one of those guilty pleasures you don t want to admit to having   like not being able to look away from a train wreck  heh   One thing this book DID do for me is  the next time I hear  it s the new Gone Girl    I ll probably steer clear  I ve done Gone Girl TWICE now  Time to move on  Maria e Vanita  aqui vai a minha opiniao  Tenham medo    tenham muito medo  Foram voces as grandes culpadas de eu ler este livro e por isso havera consequencias   Nao sou  por norma  pessoa de ler o livro da moda  E confesso que este livro  alem de ter sido moda no verao  as opinioes iam do excepcional ao lixo  o que me fazia alguma confusao  Tinha  por isso  previsto nao ler o livro  pelo menos nos proximos tempos  Mais tarde  depois da poeira assentar logo leio  pensava eu  Mas depois veio a opiniao da Vanita e a seguir a Maria a tentar me  que ate me emprestava o livro e tudo para eu nao ser expulsa de casa e pronto  li o livro Comecei na segunda feira e aproveitei a espera ontem enquanto decorriam os bypass coronarios do maridao para o acabar Rachel viaja  todos os dias  para Londres de comboio  O seu entretem e observar as pessoas que vivem nas casas  especialmente um casal a quem ela chama de Jason e Jess  Sem que os conheca  Rachel imagina que a vida deles e perfeita  Tal como era a sua com Tom  antes de ele a trair com Anne Megan e casada com Scott e e tudo menos a esposa perfeita Contado a tres vozes e a dois tempos  nem sempre conseguimos saber exactamente o que se passa porque Rachel  a rapariga no comboio  bebe em excesso e nao se consegue recordar do que se passou ou do que viu  Recorda se duma coisa aqui  doutra ali e  acima de tudo  tem a sensacao que algo se passou sem saber exactamente o que Confesso que  de inicio  estranhei o facto de Megan contar a sua versao da historia comecando uns meses antes da narrativa de Rachel  Mas passando a estranheza inicial  e um livro que se le bem  Podia  talvez  ter mais  sumo  e  talvez  ser menos previsivel   ou entao sou eu que  depois d A Verdade Sobre o Caso Harry Quebert de Joel Dicker fiquei mais exigente   Tambem confesso que acho que chamar este livro de thriller arrepiante e capaz de ser um bocadinho de exagero  Confesso ainda que nao senti aquela ansia de ter de largar o livro mas nao querer faze lo  Mas esta parte pode ser porque foi o livro perfeito para o dia de ontem   quando me chamaram a avisar que a operacao tinha terminado eu tinha acabado de ler a ultima pagina No geral direi que foi uma excelente leitura e que valeu a pena ler este livro  Recomendo  I don t know if I have ever read a book before where I felt sorry for every character  from the beginning  it keeps you intrigued  Finishing this book at 2 00 am was well worth it  I tend not to read thrillers and I stared this book knowing absolutely nothing about it except for the fact that a lot of people seemed to enjoy it  I can now say that I am also one of those people  The story started out a little slow  and yet I still found myself captivated from the beginning and as the plot moved forward  things only became more intriguing  I honestly found myself feeling super tense as I read the last half of the book  However  I was a little bit unsatisfied with the ending  Overall  I really enjoyed it  though Definitely recommending this novel   I had very high expectations of this book  It is the winner of the Goodreads Choice Award 2015 in the Mystery   Thriller category and a lot of my friends had praised it highly in their reviews The story is narrated by three characters   Rachel  Megan and Anna  Rachel is the   the girl on the train   She is a an alcoholic whose cheating husband  Tom  had divorced her for Anna  Still she is unable to let go of Tom and keeps calling  texting him and has even retain s Tom s surname  For her drinking problems Rachel has been fired from her job and just takes the train to London to keep up the pretense of still having the job  She wallows in self pity and even though she senses contempt not only from her landlady   her boyfriend  random stranger in the train etc  she can not clean up her act  While taking the train she observes a couple whom she has named Jason and Jess every day and one day she observes some thing about the couple and it gives her a jolt  Later it is found that the Jess  whose real name is Megan has gone missing and Rachel decides to play detective The three narrators of the story are flawed in some way or the other  Rachel with her substance abuse issues which her destroyed her confidence and self esteem  Megan fighting her own demons from the past and present and Anna is also shown indulging in to activities  which by her own admission  reminds her of Rachel The mystery is decent but at times Rachel s behaviour is a bit annoying  I know she is playing the part of a damaged human being but still  The identity of the culprit was a bit too easy to guess also  But overall  it is a good book to read and I would recommend it to people who enjoy psychological mysteries   One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl  Three for a girl  I m stuck on three  I just can t get any further  I started reading The Girl on the Train  thinking that it would be similar to Gone Girl  implied by the book s blurb  I was happily relieved to find that it was much better in fact  since I wasn t a big fan of Gone Girl Right away  I was drawn to Rachel  the initial narrator and main character of this book  We meet her while she is riding the train into London  a bottle of pre mixed Gin and Tonic in hand  Not sure what her purpose each day is  but I got the sense that she liked to drink from the start  She seems beaten down and depressed  and I was curious about what got her to this point  Everyday it seems  she rides the train and at the broken signal  gets a glimpse into a row of Victorian houses that sit close to the train track  It s in one of these homes that Rachel catches the site of an attractive couple  and she is attracted to their seemingly perfect  happy life  But things aren t always as they seem  are they  Twice a day  I am offered a view into other lives  just for a moment  There s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home  I don t want to say too much  since this book keeps you guessing  but it was a gripping page turner that I thoroughly enjoyed  There is so much I want to say  but I don t want to spoil anything  Let me think what is  safe  to say   Ok  first off  my jaw dropped a couple times  literally  which is always a good sign  I haven t read Gone Girl  so I can t compare them  as everyone seems to be doing  but I definitely think this book was sufficiently filled with mystery to make it interesting  but not to the point where it would seem completely unrealistic  Also  I loved the different perspectives  and how they juxtaposed each other so well  Although I really enjoyed this book  I had some problems with it  one of those being that the start was kind of slow  Also  I thought some of the characters were a bit two dimensional  and this prevented a lot of the character development I was hoping for  But  needless to say  this book was definitely worth reading  or listening to   I would really recommend someone to listen to this book on audiobook  because the narrators were really good   Not quite as intense as Gone Girl  but still along the same lines of psycho thriller craziness  I don t know why I keep reading these anxiety invoking books  I liked it  but don t really recommend it to my friends on goodreads   I listen to books  so I can t say it was hard to put down  Instead  it was hard to stop listening to it  I liked the way the perspectives of the different women narrators were woven together  I liked the whole fantasy of being on public transit and imagining the lives of people in the buildings regularly passed  It s sort of what I did in my youth on MARTA buses when I was miserable living with my mother and fantasizing about living in the various houses and apartment buildings that I passed on the way to school or work  There is an interesting discussion of this book in the Slate com Audio Book Club  I think I liked it better than they did  I ll be interested in what my own book club thinks about it when it comes up in our Fall rotation  Four stars given grudgingly for this much touted British thriller  Rachel watches the backyard of a particular house on her morning commute as the train sits at a stop on its way into London  She sees the couple who live there  imagines their lives  even assigns them names  When the news announces a missing person  Rachel realizes it is the woman from the house and finds herself involved in the case  What started out as an intriguing premise with its unreliable  unlikable narrator became disappointingly pedestrian  the plot a perfect fit for a Lifetime movie  Bumped up a star in my rating  due to the way it kept me reading to see how it would all resolve  similar books usually leave me increasingly bored through the second half  I just don t understand the hubbub and acclaim for this one  though  A fun  fast read with plenty of interesting twists and turns  Not deep  not complex characters  but an action plot whose characters often had mystifying motivations  I enjoyed the opening concept of the young woman creating lives for people she sees each day from the window of her commuter train  I think it is something many of do   create stories of the lives of people we see often in passing  Of course we are often quite wrong but luckily don t have to deal w the consequences as the girl on the train does  I really enjoyed this book  which is strange  given that I didn t like any of the main characters to start with  First there s Rachel  the main narrator  who although you at first feel pity for  you soon come to despise  Then there is Megan and Anna  both of whom appear to have it all  but are disatisfied  The author has been very clever with the narrative of this story  she introduces a character who seems perfectly rational  then allows you to get to know them  gradually revealing the truth about their character  This is a story that is very well written  cleverly it weaves the lives of the three women in and out of the narrative  by linking them closely with each other s lives  I couldn t put the book down  I just wanted to keep going until I knew truth  Definitely a must read  None of the characters in this runaway best seller are likable  There s Rachel Watson  the protagonist  who is a bitter  unemployed thirty something woman who is obsessed with her ex husband and rides the train to London each day as if she is still working  When a young woman goes missing  Rachel makes a series of incredibly dumb decisions in an effort to find out what happened to her  And she s the best of the lot Then there is Megan Hipwell  the woman who disappeared  Rachel observes Megan and her husband  whom she has dubbed Jess and Jason  on the terrace as a loving couple during a signal stop each day  and she fantasizes about them as the ideal couple  They are anything but  Megan is a drifter who got into prostitution and drugs as a youth and has a dark secret  And finally there is Anna Boyd  a cold seductress who stole Rachel s husband  Tom Watson  I couldn t help but think of the professional golfer   Anna is calculating and hateful toward Rachel  though with good reason as Rachel is prone to stalking her and showing up drunk at the house where she and Tom once lived Suspects abound as the hunt for Megan progresses  There is her husband  Scott  who is jealous and occasionally violent  There is her therapist  with whom she had a fling  And there is somebody else in her life Paula Hawkins has crafted a tightly woven mystery that gains steam as it progresses  The reader won t want to put this one down  She leaves little clues along the way  inviting the reader to guess who the real killer is after Megan s body is discovered  I had it all wrong  which is the sign of a skillful mystery writer I would recommend this book  though the writer didn t make me care enough about any of the characters  save for Rachel  I did not see that   But then again  I really suck at figuring out who did things in mysteries and thrillers       OH WELL  I still thought it was good  the writing was quite addictive  I totally see why people are comparing it to Gone Girl  If you liked Gone Girl this is definitely for you Oh goodness    I just finished this one and to be honest  I feel exhausted  It was complex  well thought out  and had tons of twists and turns  I really enjoyed the story  but it took me a few days to finish it because you had to pay attention to the simple parts  Each and every word played an intricate part in the story as a whole  The Girl on The Train pulled me in with the creep factor and tangled me up in a web of lies  My mind was working double time trying to figure out what in the world was going on  The characters were so complex and weird    I started off thinking that Rachel was disgusting and hopeless  but then with a faint of heart  I started to feel really bad for her  She wasn t right in the head and I knew the secrets would slowly reveal themselves They compared this story to Gone Girl and I would say that s an accurate comparison  If you are looking for a book with sexy scenes though  this book probably isn t for you    Yes  there were intimate interactions  but the Author just grazed the surface by mentioning and moving along I would definitely recommend this book to readers looking for a good book that leaves you thinking     What in the heck just happened  Please remember though  it is slow at times because in order to follow the story you need lots of details and the Author gives us LOTS of descriptions and little points you think are non sense at the time  They do play a crucial part in the end though  Great book  Once you get past the first couple chapters and get used to the writer  it s an easy read  You never know where this story is going until the end  Very suspenseful  As entertaining a read as Gone Girl made all the more real as I know the places in the story having travelled up and down the same railway line for years  I like the story from different voices technique  Rachel is the kind of character that makes you pity her but also want to shake by the shoulders and say sort yourself out woman  I hope if it does get filmed it s not  Americanised  as I think it s English setting adds to the  behind closed doors  tension  If you read and liked Gone Girl you ll like this  Davam 4 zvezi s ugovorkata  che sa tolkova  a ne 3  zaradi

olmadigini soyluyorlardi   Cinayet dedigin islenir  yapilmaz ki    Bir de elimdeki 12  baskisi  Rachel is an alcoholic who is struggling to keep herself together after a messy divorce  Riding the same train every day  she finds herself making up stories about the people and houses she sees along her route  When she sees something unusual  she becomes a part of a missing persons investigation that changes her entire life  I compulsively read this book in about five or six hours  with just a couple of breaks  It s not perfect by any standard  but it was definitely a page turner for me  The book  as everyone knows  has been compared endlessly to  Gone Girl   I actually probably enjoyed this more than  Gone Girl   which like  but not as much as some of Flynn s other books  Oddly enough  I did read  The Girl on the Train  the day after watching  Gone Girl  on film for the first time  so all of that was swirling in my head No one in this novel is particularly likeable  though Rachel has her moments  The book is told from the viewpoint of three different women and each has their own personality and character flaws  Hawkins is adept at drawing you into their worlds and their feelings  I found myself somewhat mesmerized by Rachel and the mess she seemed to consistently get herself in  About three fourths of the way through  I though the story lagged a bit  and then picked up at the end  There s a point where I found myself rooting for Rachel  despite all of her flaws  and that s pretty impressive  All in all  the book wasn t as much of a deep psychological thriller as some  but it was an oddly intriguing portrait of several individuals  I m glad I picked it up  even if for a few hours   Great story about damaged goods  Perhaps that s why I could relate  Perhaps that s why anyone could  We re all such a mess of bad and good  of secrets and pain  of the capacity for compassion and joy and hatred and addiction  aren t we  I loooooved having an unreliable narrator  Get it together  Rachel  I also have a thing for books where you hate most of the characters so this was right up my alley  I raved about this book while reading and was shocked that members of my book club who already read it said it would not make a good discussion  That is  until I got to the end and was quite literally like  oh   There s really nothing substantial to discuss  I wanted jaw dropping twists and turns and instead was left feeling hungover  But in all  it s a fun read   This one kept me on my toes  I really enjoyed the mystery  even though some of it was a bit obvious   I love a good twisty turny mystery  and that is what Paula Hawkins has presented here  While the three women whose stories comprise this book are not the most likable  they are fascinatingly flawed  I was completely intrigued by them  and the only one whom I couldn t get behind despite those flaws was Anna  She really struck me as a total witch until the end  Regardless  I loved the unreliable narratives that make the reader question what parts of each story are real and what parts are exaggerated or imagined due to the characters  paranoia and neuroses  It made me question a couple of times my own hypotheses on what actually happened to the victim  I did finally deduce the truth  but when it was revealed in the story  my blood still ran cold  and I think that is the mark of a really well written thriller  There were a few times when the characters were a little too over the top or cringe worthy in their various neuroses and I did have to wrinkle my nose at those  but in the end  it didn t stop me from turning the pages and wanting to know what was next  It was a very noir type story  a style which I adore  and I ended up blowing right through this novel  I have trouble reading thrillers  as the predictability and ridiculousness of many of the situations is just too much for my eye roll reflex to handle  This book was different  Yes  what I guessed would happen about 1 2 way through did end up happening at the end  but I was not 100  sure   I was kept guessing what the specifics of the situation were until almost the very end  I hated having to putting this book down when my 45 minute trip to and from work concluded each day   I always wanted more  Rachel s blackouts  and switching between three different narrators made the story really intriguing and kept the book moving at a really high pace  As a bookseller  you often hear  this book is the next Fifty Shades Harry Potter Rosie Project   but in this case  the  next Gone Girl  label is actually fitting  Looking forward to seeing this book take off  and let the  next Girl On The Train  comparisons begin  I read this in one day  I wanted to know about the characters and their stories  I loved the writing  I really enjoyed the narrative and how the author slowly merged the timelines  I loved the idea of the protagonist not being terribly likable  Truly I got rather frustrated and disgusted by her but wanted her to seek help  I felt like I would like the person behind the alcohol  If you liked Gone Girl and stories like that you will like this   This was an extremely intense and heart breaking audio book  but the exploration of what it means to be a woman these days is very different from what Gone Girl is doing  First I want to say that I listened to this as an audible audiobook  partly during a long drive but then had to keep listening after because it absorbed me so much  It uses different first person narration  all female and that can sometimes be confusing in an audiobook but not in this case  Also I sometimes find it distracting in audiobooks when a male voice reads a female characters lines or vice versa but that wasn t the case here  maybe because when it happened it was meant to be a first person female narrator saying the males lines  if that makes sense   So I recommend the audiobook version of this  which hasn t been rue for several audiobooks I listen to   Next I have to say I really loved this book  perhaps because I was a train commuter for a year or two in my twenties and was always curious about the glimpsed backyard lives I would go past  I also loved that even though the main protagonist is a blacking out alcoholic with a life in crisis  I found her highly sympathetic and in particular her descriptions of the grief of still feeling love for an ex after they have moved on  BTDT as they say though thankfully I didn t deal with it the same way   I m surprised so many reviewers here said no one was a sympathetic character  It s true every person in this book is behaving badly in one way or another  but I felt a great deal of empathy for her as well as for the victim  Won t say more to not give spoilers  I do agree with others that the who done it wasn t that surprising by the time it was revealed but I didn t find that took away from the story since I was more curious about how it would be revealed   in general highly recommend this book as long as you can feel empathy for highly flawed people struggling to be better  which apparently some other reviewers here found difficult  I can definitely see the similarities between this book and Gillian Flynn s book Gone Girl  Both are about the disappearance of a married woman  In this book  the married woman is found dead  Of course  the police suspect that her husband murdered her  In Gone Girl  Amy Dunne disappears  and her husband Nick is accused of her murder  Amy turns out to have faked her death and run away  she also happens to be crazy  Both of these novels deal with marriages  infidelity  and lies  I like how in The Girl on the Train  the main character is an unreliable witness  Rachel is a drunk whose husband Tom cheated on her with a woman named Anna  whom he s now married to  Rachel lost her job and won t leave Tom and Anna alone  She calls Tom constantly because she wants to talk to him  she stops by Tom and Anna s house uninvited  Rachel takes the train to work everyday  after she loses her job for being drunk at work  she continues to ride the train on a daily basis  She becomes obsessed with watching Tom and Anna s neighbors Megan and Scott while she s on the train  One day  she sees something out of the ordinary which gives her a reason for living  She tries to become sober  I thought it was really interesting how Rachel had blackouts and couldn t remember the things she did and said when she was really drunk  She tries her hardest to remember if she saw Megan on the day of her disappearance  Like Gone Girl  the characters in The Girl on the Train are rather despicable human beings  The only ones who are slightly likable are Rachel s roommate and Rachel s mom  Complete Review  http   mislibrosyresenas blogspot com   Me gusto  Aunque Rachel ha sido una de las protagonistas mas molestas que he leido  el libro me tuvo curiosa todo el tiempo y me llego un momento en que de verdad queria saber que era lo que habia pasado  Lo que si es que yo me sospechaba al culpable desde mucho antes  Resena Completa  http   mislibrosyresenas blogspot com    The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins4 stars     Life is not a paragraph  and death is no parenthesis    So  I had been on a run of emotional reads and needed something different to brush away those proverbial emotional cobwebs   nothing better than a suspense type read  This is one of those books that gets the old grey matter working as you try and become Sherlock Holmes  reading between the lines and putting two and two together and coming up with five  I have to admit I was pretty useless in trying to work out whodunit in this one  although I did work it out before it was revealed  but not long before    One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl  four for a boy  five for silver  six for gold  seven for a secret never to be told  I ve got a few of those    This is a book where I found it hard to like any of the characters  which actually amazes me considering I could not put the book down  I was sympathetic towards Rachel at times  but even her I wanted to throttle at various points  So how can a book full of characters that you hate be so all consuming  This is the genius part  the plot was unique  the writing suspenseful and addictive and not one character in this book turns out who what you perceive them to be    The holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mould yourself through the gaps    This book was like a charade party  at the beginning you knew who everyone was pretending to be and then when they took of their mask  bam  totally somebody else   you get my drift  Everyone in this book wears a mask  whether it be for good or evil  Who to trust  Who to believe     Nobody warned me it would break us  But it did  Or rather  it broke me  and then I broke us    We have all had that daily  monotonous commute whereby you sit down on the train and look aimlessly out the window as the scenery passes you by  the same shit  different day scenario  Rachel s train stops at the same stop light every day and this stop light is right outside a little row of houses and Rachel has dreamt up who lives there  what they do  where they work etc  She has created this little fictional village in her head to pass the time  One day she sees something away from the norm  she knows she shouldn t have seen it  but it just adds a bit more spice to the little story that she has going on in her head  When the woman later turns up missing is what Rachel saw pertinent to the investigation    I want to drag knives over my skin  just to feel something other than shame  but I m not even brave enough for that   I have to say  I did start out listening to this one but found that I had to jump back to actually reading it because the switches in POV and timeline jumps got really confusing at times when you are playing it by ear  This is a book that is continually moving  hurtling you around in the process  especially your brain as you struggle to keep a mental note of all the who  what s  where s and why s  Rachel has had a tough few years  she has just lost her job  just got divorced from her husband who left her for another woman and she walks around in a permanent state of drunkenness   she is a wallower  She wallows in self pity for the majority of this book but finally when she is sober you begin to see the real Rachel underneath  The trouble with being a drunk is you become an unreliable witness and when her past and present begin to collide the mess only gets messier    I felt isolated in my misery  I became lonely  so I drank a bit  and then a bit more  and then I became lonelier  because no one likes being around a drunk  I lost and I drank and I drank and I lost    For a debut novel this was a fantastic read  Paula Hawkins truly delivered a book that confused  befuddled and totally messed with your mind  With many a red herring thrown in to throw you off the scent you will find yourself constantly second guessing everything you read  It was like Cluedo   it was Mr Black  in the drawing room with a rope   oh no it was Mrs Red  in the garden with a hammer  oh no it wasn t it was   and it goes on   and on   until finally EUREKA     They re what I lost  they re everything I want to be    If you love suspense then this is a great read and if you can get past some irritating characters that make stupid choices then you will definitely love it  I can t wait to see what else Paula Hawkins pens  because if this is anything to go by she has an extremely bright future ahead of her www theromancecover com A very juicy book that reads more like a screenplay than a novel  This book was written for the screen  A great mystery compelling characters  a twist  and an ending that leaves absolutely no loose ends  some people may find this annoying   Oh  and Emily Blunt is  notmyrachel  Do better Hollywood  Told by three very unreliable narrators in limited omniscient first person points of view   The Girl on the Train  is just so fascinating and full of intrigues that once starting it  one just has to go all the way to the end  Now I get why this book has been staying a best selling for so long  What a convoluted page turner it turns out to be  Seriously  it s the kind of book that can t be put down mid way I did get a lot of things right though  particularly the answers to  who did it  and  what went down    Feeling like a detective  and so very mentally exhausted as well        Everything is not just what it seems   4 5 Thrilling Stars       audiobook   spoiler freeThe audio production Three very distinct English narrators gives us a compelling insight into the lives of Rachel  Megan  and Anna  The audio narrations were amazing  The 3 different voices allowed for a smoother transition between the different characters as oppose to just allowing one narrator to read the whole book with prefacing it with just a verbal naming of who s POV is being read  The story Told in 3 different POVs  this thriller weaves the tale of how all three women s lives are somehow connected  It starts with Rachel seeing something while riding the train  That starts the domino of events that intertwine the stories of Rachel  Megan  and Anna  The storytelling is phenomenal  allowing us readers into the psyche of these women before the event  keeping this spoiler free  and after  It messes with your sympathy and dislike for the characters and when you think you are going down one pathway of feelings and thoughts  it diverts you to another  I constantly had to keep changing my theories of how I think this story would end  A great thriller   Enormously entertaining  This tale  told by the most unreliable of narrators is chock full of interesting and wonderfully drawn characters  a tremendous and propulsive story and an endearing and compelling alcoholic protagonist  The story is interesting and entirely credible  The writing seamless and crystalline and the characters motives relatable  at least to me   This book is very difficult to put down and it at no point disappoints  I can hardly wait for what she writes next  This is an author to be reckoned with  I might be the last one to review this book  but then  this book came out around the same time as my book  and I just couldn t get to it  The book is Paula Hawkins s debut thriller and I haven t read her previous novels  but I can definitely say  she has arrived  The book is definitely super engaging and sort of unputdownable  And no  it s not like Gone Girl  though  the style of writing maybe a bit similar  Gone Girl was different  This is different  For starters  Gone Girl was about one conceited troubled woman  this is about three  if you know what I mean   The story revolves around the life of three women  like I just mentioned  at least one of them pretty miserable in her life and a maniac depressive of sorts  This is Rachel  who in a way is the main protagonist of the story because it s her voice we read 60  of the time  She drinks and has frequent spells of complete  black outs   That aside  she is pretty exhausting at times and yet she is somebody you could totally relate to  I have made those same train journeys that she emphatically talks about and the way she describes all the people she sees  it s almost like  That s Me  I Saw Those Very Same People From The Train All The Time  The narration then progresses on to focus on the lives of two other women  Anna is married to Rachel s ex husband  and Megan is another crazy woman  by all means a  psycho bitch   The characters are all really flawed   unreliable  and full of conceit  Imagine what would happen if somehow destiny was to bring them all close together  like intertwine their lives  and leave them to resolve it  huh  If I say anything more  I will be giving out the story and I don t want to do that  I just want to say that I loved reading this novel and truly wish to see a movie adaptation of it very soon  The writing is mature and quite in keeping with the requirements of the genre  Overall  a splendid clap worthy praise worthy debut  Spoiler alert     I approached this book somewhat differently  I expected to hate everybody in it  because that was the top complaint from my fellow readers  I did not care for the characters  but I did see that at least Megan and Rachel had some background as to why they should behave the way they did  It was not too surprising that Megan was a little out of her mind considering what happened with the baby  and what happened with her brother  For Rachel  I could also see that not being able to have a baby have a could throw someone over the edge  Of course  there are more productive ways to deal with that situation  but then there would ve been no thriller  I figured out who the killer was somewhat early  I was interested to see how it s all going to transpire in the end  Rachel is clearly off her rocker  I can t believe it took me long to figure out who she was riding the train every day to spy on her old house and life  I gave the book four stars because it kept me turning the pages and I m so curious to see what would happen  The last sentence really super creeped me out  As far as the Gone Girl comparisons  it definitely felt very similar  But it was pretty similar in that at the end of Gone Girl  I hated the two of them too  I just didn t hit them throughout the entire book  Also  kind of oddly Anna and Tom reminded me a little bit of the characters Lamb to the Slaughter  The short story by Roald Dahl  This book really messed with my mind  I kind of had a feeling that certain things were going to happen  but with an unreliable main character  it was hard to figure out  Loved it  I can see why everyone compares it to Gone Girl  If you liked Gone Girl  you ll probably like The Girl on the Train  If you hated Gone Girl  still give this one a try Rachel is a complex character  She is kind of like a good friend who makes some really bad choices   I wanted to smack her and tell her to get it together  but I couldn t ever hate her  The premise is intriguing   seeing the same people every day when riding the train  It almost feels like you know them    However  the plot ends up being very predictable  Although I knew early on how the book would end  I enjoyed the ride getting there  Very quick read   took me one morning to finish it  in between loads of laundry   While not an earth shattering read for me  I ll pick up Hawkins s next book  What can I say I m really on a women s thrillers kick as of late  Holy wow  were none of the characters in this likable  Still  I did become attached to our primary protagonist  an unemployed alcoholic peeping Tom  The twist was not a surprise  You kind of figure it out given who the narrators are and how few characters are introduced  but still I was sucked in  Very well written and great characterization  I enjoyed it  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is my preference for less language  The book in its entirety was a great  intense read  I found it hard to put it down and when I did  I found myself pondering the possible future outcomes  You cant get the book out of your head  It s a roller coaster ride from the very beginning to the end  Did not disappoint   I almost didn t finish this book as I found the characters so unlikeable they were irritating  I m glad I persevered  The narrative is driven by each chapter belonging to an individual character and written in the first person The storyline is excellent original and fast paced  A real who done it until almost the last chapter   I liked the beginning a lot  the set up of characters  I liked the continuous guessing of what happened  I kept changing my mind a lot which is fun  I didn t like the evil twirling mustache monolog of the killer at the end  Great book though  Megan  Rachel and Anna will forever be bonded  Rachel was first married to Tom but he left her due to her drinking  had an affair with Anna and married her  While married to Anna  he has an affair with Megan  she s married to Scott   She gets pregnant and threatens to tell Anna which makes Tom kill her  Rachel whose become a severe alcoholic  has suppressed memories of the night Megan disappeared but it s foggy due to her inebriated state on a normal basis  By the time she figures out what truly happened  she s on her way to save Anna and what happens next is what the book is all about  mis perceptions  I was confused at first in the way the author kept bringing each woman s storyline into the book but it was well written and showed each woman s point of view  Ket cau trinh tham cua truyen khong co ve an tuong lam  Nhung cam xuc cua nhan vat chinh qua la am anh manh  ma cung that gan de hieu    Tom lai  vi theo quang cao phim   xep hang truyen tren truyen thong loi keo thi mua quyen nay cung khong uong     Book had me hooked  I read this very fast on vacation one afternoon  I needed to know what happened   I m giving this book 3 5 Stars  Alot of readers compare this book to Gone Girl and I see the similarities  especially in the tone but I believe this book is not in the same standard  If I m using Gone Girl as the measuring stick for this book then my review is as follows  1  Gone Girl had a unexpected  smart twist in the mid point but The Girl on the Train was not as successful in the twist  I did guess it  2  Gone Girl s ending is one of my favourites  the open ended  unsatisfactory  the no nicely packaged  the bad guy gets justice happy ending  This book was the opposite  3  The quality of writing of Gone Girl was better 4  Like Gone Girl I didn t like any of the characters in the book  I know I will never re read Gone Girl or The Girl on the Train  I want to like my fictional characters  5  A page turner read so I expect anyone who picks up the book to have a good time  From www pingwings ca Cover image and summary from Goodreads A debut psychological thriller that will forever change the way you look at other people s lives Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning  Every day she rattles down the track  flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes  and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck  She s even started to feel like she knows them   Jess and Jason   she calls them  Their life  as she sees it  is perfect  Not unlike the life she recently lost And then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough  Now everything s changed  Unable to keep it to herself  Rachel offers what she knows to the police  and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next  as well as in the lives of everyone involved  Has she done more harm than good A compulsively readable  emotionally immersive  Hitchcockian thriller that draws comparisons to Gone Girl  The Silent Wife  or Before I Go to Sleep  this is an electrifying debut embraced by readers across markets and categories VERY MINOR SPOILERSThis book had so much buzz and I ended up preordering a copy for myself and for my mom  She read the book in a single sitting  which I took as a really good sign  Then I ended up reading the whole book in one sitting  Once I started  I knew I couldn t put it down until I d read the entire thing Part of the buzz I kept hearing about The Girl on the Train was calling it the next Gone Girl  Now  Gone Girl is one of my favourite books  and I am a total sucker for any book that gets compared to it  Even though I feel like those kinds of comparisons are more of a marketing tool  and are not very accurate  I still find myself drawn in  Anyway  all that is to say that this is not  to me   the next Gone Girl   but I can perhaps see why it s being marketed as such There are three different narrators in this book  and I enjoyed how different their voices were from each other  They definitely felt like distinct voices  which isn t always the case for me when reading a book with multiple narrators Rachel  who I think of as the  main  narrator  was a really interesting character  and due to her alcohol induced blackouts  not the most reliable narrator  I LOVE the use of an unreliable narrator  because it keeps me on my toes  paying more attention to the story and details than I otherwise might  At the same time  since I knew going in that this book employed the unreliable narrator  I wonder if maybe I was paying more attention because I was looking for things to make me distrust or not believe Rachel Rachel was someone I kind of pitied at the beginning of the story  Her life was a mess  and she kept doing things that I wanted to yell at her not to do  But over the course of the story  as Megan s disappearance stretched on  it seemed that Rachel found some sort of purpose that made her want to stay sober  and I liked her so much by the end of the book  Details of Rachel s life   and Megan s   are revealed over the course of the book  and by the end  I felt like I knew them and understood why they made some of the choices they did I loved the way the mystery unraveled  because basically all of my suspicions were addressed throughout the book in some way  And even though I  solved  the mystery early on  I wound up second guessing myself right up until the end  But figuring out  whodunnit  doesn t mean the mystery wasn t well done  This book was tense  suspenseful  twisty  and really satisfying Definitely recommended  Primero lo primero  no se crean las comparaciones con  Gone Girl   Quizas lo que tengan en comun es el formato  en ambos libros cada capitulo tiene un narrador distinto  Y hasta ahi llegamos  No empecemos a decir que todos los libros con un twist son  Gone Girl  porque entonces  Sexto sentido  es  Gone Girl  con muertos  y tampoco la boludez El libro es un muy buen policial  sin policias  Hay una desaparicion y el lector juega a adivinar que paso en realidad  Eso esta barbaro  cuando uno lee a Agatha Christie lo que quiere es descubrir al asesino antes que te lo diga la autora  no es cierto  Y si no ocurre  entonces el libro esta bien  Bueno  la verdad es que uno mas o menos se imagina como termina todo  Pero Hawkins se las arregla bien para que no sea evidente y te hace dudar de cada hipotesis que se te va ocurriendo  Incluso de las que resultan ser ciertas Sin embargo  hay dos cosas en las que falla  y que  Gone Girl  lo hace maravillosamente   Primero  las tres narradoras de la historia hablan exactamente igual  Hasta tienen los mismos modismos los tres  las tres  suben al piso de arriba   como si pudieran subir al piso de abajo  aunque culpo a la traduccion por eso   Te das cuenta cual de las tres habla porque las tres tienen una historia personal distinta y las referencias cambian  pero como hablan es identico en las tres  Y el otro punto flaco es que no me generaron ni un pito de empatia ninguna de las tres  Hay un personaje  Scott  que me parecia el mas interesante de todos  pero las tres minas no me generaban nada  Al menos a la mina de  Gone Girl  la putee en todos los idiomas Cuando hagan la pelicula  espero que Dylan Bruce haga de Scott  Toda la novela me lo imagine como el  I did enjoy the journey that was reading this book  While it was not as amazing as Gone Girl  which the book is constantly compared to  I still enjoyed it  Can t wait to read what the author comes up with next     Bitches be crazy  Men are pigs  A story best read by Gaslight  I really enjoyed this book for the most part but the ending let it down a bit  I would definitely recommend reading it though  Similar to Gone  Girl  except I liked the book rather than hating it  The characters are complex and the story is well woven  I had a hard time putting it down  Great read  Hooks you from the start  thought the ending could have been a little more climatic  but overall great author  Something bad happenedSi parla moltissimo di questo libro ultimamente e  dopo aver letto che lo si puo paragonare a Gone Girl  ho capito che dovevo leggero E  un buon thriller  in cui si alternano i punti di vista di tre donne diversissime tra loro  chi dira la verita  Rachel che ogni giorno osserva la vita degli altri attraverso il finestrino di un treno ma che si consola con l alcol  Anna che ha  rubato  il marito a Rachel  O Megan che scappa dal suo passato  Intrigante e coinvolgente  non un capolavoro e non all altezza di Gone Girl  ma indubbiamente ti mette la smania di sapere come andra a finire  tanto da non riuscire a poggiarlo sul comodino  Not a totally new concept  but kept me interested  the plot turned out to be gripping  the story skilfully delivered  I really liked the train like rhythm of the narration   and the ending not that predictable  Highly recommended for those seeking not online a good thriller  but also some sociological and psychological depth  There has been a lot of hype about this book and I usually tend to stay away from books where there is this much hype  I know that I can be influenced one way or another  Generally in the negative towards a book  Don t ask me why  it s just something that happens  Or I believe it happens   As well as the hype   mostly on Twitter  I ve read a couple of reviews of the book and it seems to be a bit of a Marmite book because the protagonist isn t all sweetness and light  She has her flaws and this doesn t seem to be something readers are used to Anyway  this was the third book I read on holiday  Rachel our protagonist is recovering from a divorce and has a problem with alcohol  She likes to look out of the train window on her daily commute and particularly at a certain house  She sees a couple living there  they are often on the veranda area of their home  Rachel has made up names for the couple and by the affection they show each other she has also written their lives out   in her head  This seems to be a form of vicarious living on Rachel s part I see that Rachel has a problem with alcohol  but it doesn t make me want to stop reading  I m not irritated by her  I like Hawkins style of writing  It s clean  uncluttered and factual  for the fictional needs  The story really starts when Rachel sees something she s not expecting to see on that veranda  something that shocks her  It s not enough that we as readers know the whole story  but it s enough for Rachel to want to do the right thing  but because of her troubled life this isn t easy  The story follows her trying to do what she thinks will help but often ends up not doing much to help at all and causing more harm to her fragile self esteem which exacerbates the drinking cycle We also have chapters from the viewpoint of other important characters in the story  mixed in with Rachel s  We have chapters from Megan  the missing woman  from before and leading up to her going missing  and we have chapters from the viewpoint of Rachel s ex husband s new wife  who is not amused by the drunken ex wife still in their lives So  I m sitting in the middle ground area  I m not raving about it or hating it  but I will say it s a really enjoyable crime read and I did want to keep picking it back up to see what happened next  I enjoyed it  I think flawed protagonists are great  Hard work for an author to work with because you need to keep the reader interested but I personally love them   Note my recent penchant for serial killer novels   The pace of this book was wonderful  I love alternating chapters  they really work for me and I liked that Rachel wasn t a do gooder on a train who wanted to solve the crime like a member of the Scooby Doo gang With thanks to the author  publisher and NetGalley for my copy  I enjoyed listening to the audio of this book and found it very intriguing  It had a great plot and believable characters  It is told by different perspectives from the different characters and is hard to figure out exactly what is actually happening until the very end  It held my interest throughout and I actually liked it better than Gone Girl   Now I see what all the fuss is about  This is a tale of human tragedy with a title character  Rachel Watson  who seeks both solitude and attention  her life ruined by circumstance and smashed dreams  She is an alcoholic who is completely broken and living as a ghost in her new life  pining for the old one  In short  she herself is a trainwreck  She fantasizes on her commute to the city  about the lives of strangers she sees  and that  with her booze  is her escape from reality  What she witnesses on her commute one day from the window of the train pulls her into the lives of others who she may be able to help when a horrible tragedy occurs  But is she capable and coherent enough to be of any help This story masterfully plays on the reader s perception of the characters and their perception of each other  It is successful in painting a portrait of human misery  filled with conflict  paranoia  jealousy and fear  The characters are frail and broken and Rachel among them is what society would consider the weakest  a social liability as it were  This is not entirely untrue and she drives events from her own selfishness and neediness rather than a clear sense of duty  But her actions have a domino effect that open up truths and reveal  for better or worse  what real tragedy lies underneath  A multilayered  nuanced portrayal of human existence is played out here and it shows the depth of deception in both men and women  It shows the frailty  but also the strength of the human spirit and the desire to go good  no matter how misguided  Spoilers 3   2    1    Really  stop reading this and read the book  SPOILERS  What   Seriously        A freaking sociopath  The ending wreaks of deus ex machina  but it s oh so clever in its execution  ha  pun   I ve never met a pathological liar  an alcoholic  or a repeat adulterer  Stay away from this crowd  I enjoyed the book overall  Some parts of the book were a bit dry and dragged  but the ending took me for a total loop  I recommend it   One of the most gripping thrillers I ve ever read  It really messed with my mind and I was jumpy and a bit paranoid  So it was very believeable  At first I was like  um  why is she on the train so much   but then it was Aaaah  who did it  where  how    These were not very good characters   you would never want them to be your friends  neighbors  family  That said  I loved reading about them and as much as Rachel would frustrate me  I was still kind of rooting for her to stop drinking and move on I didn t guess the plot  which always makes me happy  but I could see where others were able to identify the crime a little quicker And again  I wish Alfred Hitchcock were still alive   he would have done an excellent movie for this book  Con este libro me ha pasado algo curioso  odie a todos los personajes pero no podia dejar de leerlo  Ni siquiera puedo decir que me desconcertara  ni me sorprendiera mucho  pero si que me volvi viciosa con esta lectura  necesitaba terminar de conocer como se desarrollarian los personajes y la historia  Por eso considero que merece las 4 estrellas aunque me desagraden Rachel  Tom  Scott  Anna  Megan y hasta la oficial     todos los personajes eran deprimentes  enfermos y grises  The ending was kinda obvious  but the book is so well written  I couldn t stop reading until I finished   After watching the movie and then reading the book  Gone Girl   I really wanted to get more of the same and somehow  The Girl on the Train  seemed like a perfect  sequel   And it didn t disappoint  Not to reveal any plot lines  I ll just say that it has some good characters  plot twists and a lot of suspense  This is the type of books that make me fall in love with reading over and over again  Awful people doing awful things to themselves and to others It s good  very good  really  if you like mysteries with unreliable narrators  tangles of lies  and creepiness  It seems that I do  When I finished  I went back and re read one of the three PoVs because I knew the author had left many clues there and I just didn t see them the first time around  Well done   This book reminded me a lot of Gone Girl  It took a minute to get into but couldn t put it down after  This book is what many would describe as a slow burner  After all  there are no explosions  set pieces  or car chases  When reading the title  I thought it was a wink at being deliberately unassuming and untheatrical  an ironic contrast to the action that lies within But no  for a good portion of the book  The Girl On The Train literally is about a girl on a train The train does not derail  it does not get invaded by ninjas  and it is not in fact a time machine disguised as a train  The setting  a London suburb  does not come across as attractive  and to be honest  neither do the characters   in looks or personality In the first few chapters  you re dying for something to happen   for the main character to have to stand up and let an old person sit down  for the train to get delayed due to leaves on the track  for the train conductor to come and check the tickets   SOMETHING Many have compared the book to Gone Girl because of its shared  domestic noir  genre  but in Gone Girl we are hooked in by a missing person story in the opening chapter  The Girl On The Train doesn t even have this Probably the most exciting part of the first chapter is  I sliced through the top of my finger while chopping the onions  But what it lacks in pizazz  The Girl On The Train delivers in character and intrigue  You can t help but be sucked in to the characters  worlds Hawkins  first thriller is extraordinary in its ordinariness  Strip all of the glamour away  and you are left with characters that feel desperate  broken  and real  Hawkins recognises that it is the characters that make the page turn Rachel is something of an anti hero  and I often struggled to get on with her  as does Cathy  her friend  who I feel deserves a bigger part in the mystery   Rachel is selfish  needy  unstable  and nearly always drunk  like the Hunger Games  Haymitch  but without the wit and charm to pull it off While this makes the novel  which is mostly narrated by her  an often frustrating read  it also makes for the perfect plot device  Because Rachel never knows what s going on  we as readers are also never sure of what s going on  But when Rachel unravels secret after secret  we share in both her shock and disorientation The book teaches you not to make snap judgements  because every character is hiding something It begins with Rachel s fantasised version of characters who she has never met  who she can see through the train window  But even when these characters are introduced and their lives overlap  we re still not sure how to separate the fact from the fiction The Girl On The Train is a minimalist s dream  and shows how the withholding of secrets and good storytelling can compel and captivate in even the most mundane of set ups Yes  I did find it slow to begin with But  like a train pulling away from a station  I found myself building more and more momentum the further I got  until soon I was unstoppable Enjoy the dark tunnels  the turns  and the gripping character landscapes   you don t want to miss them  First of all  I really wish the comparisons of The Girl on the Train to Gone Girl would stop  as I actually thought this book was better  Other than being a psychological thriller  I didn t really see many similarities between the two  I agree with the statement in a review in The Guardian   Hawkins s Girl is a less flashy  but altogether more solid creation   I listened to the audio version of the book  and it definitely held my interest  however  I actually think I should have avoided reading most reviews  as some gave away too many plot details  The part of the story line that I most tired of was that of Rachel s drinking   I honestly just wanted to shake her at times and tell her to get on with her life  Obviously  her drinking was central to the plot though  so rather than saying more and risk giving anything away  I would recommend simply reading the book and avoiding reviews   Psychological thriller set in London   The Home Counties   the village on the edge of London  A hugely hyped thriller  so what is it that makes it so suspenseful Rachel is a commuter travelling into Euston  London  from the Northwestern Home Counties  who idles away her time on the train into London by peering into the lives of others in the houses abutting the railway lines  And the serried ranks of urban housing certainly feed her fertile imagination  notwithstanding that one of the houses she passes everyday is the house in which she lived with her former husband Tom  He has moved Anna in  and together they now have a daughter  Evie  It is a daily reminder to Rachel of the relationship she has lost  Five houses down from her earlier home  in the very same row on Blenheim Street  she regularly observes a couple interacting in their garden  and she personalises them by inventing names for them  Jess and Jason  in actual fact Megan and Scott Hipwell  But Rachel has alcohol problems  and although she continues the commute into and out of London  she no longer has a job to go to  She was fired for being drunk  But one day she sees Jess being caressed by someone in the garden who isn t Jason  and shortly thereafter  Jess goes missing  Rachel is desperate to get involved in the search for the missing woman  at last she has a mission  at last she can be of some use to someone   Tom planted the notion with her that she is fat  a drunkard and pretty useless  But because of these alcohol excesses she seems to be a rather unreliable witness and finds herself sidelined by most of the people who are at the centre of this drama  However  the more she is rejected  the more she is driven to insinuate herself into the vagaries of the investigation It is a gripping read and generally deserving of the fulsome praise  The short sentences and short chapters often feel clipped  which on the one hand can feel limiting  but on the other mirrors the stop start of a typical commuter train s progress into a congested London station  The train compartments are hot  they are steamy when it rains  there is little standing room    it is life writ large of the London bound commuter But for me the book comes with a proviso  The main female players all essentially come from a similar mould  they are all seem to be  as Anna says of Megan   absent and self involved   and not distinctively fleshed out to really stand out as individuals  They all have the capacity to dissociate from their lives  which then ripples back to the reader  I found it a struggle to really connect with the characters  I am also not overly keen on endings where characters gather together to reflect on what has been going on and then drop the final clues into place to make a cohesive ending This book comes with a warning if you are going to read it on a train  Enjoy  Primer libro del ano 2016 y vaya que necesitaba una lectura que me atrapara y de esas que no las puedes soltar  Es verdad que las primeras paginas son un poco introductoras lo que lo hace un poco flojito pero a pesar de eso no te da motivos para soltarlo  Una vez que conoci a la protagonista  Rachel  me encanto  Me encanto que fuera tan realista con problemas que podria tener cualquier persona  me encanto que no fuera la tipica protagonista perfecta que a menudo se nos presenta en una novela  El libro en si me gusto bastante  el hecho que fuera de misterio me engancho  la forma en que la autora escribio el genero fue genial y es que tenia todo lo que uno suele esperar y al final siempre en estos casos los escritores les dan ese vuelco que no esperas y nada es como lo preves  bueno todo eso pasa aqui  Tambien me encanto que nos hablaran del pasado de los personajes y no nos centraramos solo en el presente  Puntos en contra  hay capitulos bastante aburridos y monotonos  algunos son bien parecidos sin muchas variantes lo que por momentos lo hace decaer  Tambien que la primera parte transcurriera todo en el tren me tenia histerica  una vez que cambio de escenarios ya pude engancharme mas  Los personajes en general todos me han gustado  Pero sin duda lo que mas me ha gustado a sido que Rachel estaba tan perdida en este misterio como nosotros y que ni ella supiera que hacer o que fue lo que paso te hacia mezclarte con ella y comenzar juntas a descubrir la resolucion  Sin embargo el final no si era lo que esperaba o lo que me hubiese gustado que fuera o como fuera  A pesar de todo me gusto bastante y agradesco que haya sido mi primera lectura de este ano   I m thinking this is more of a 3 5  but I rounded up because it definitely was a page turner  I consider this a good thing    I can understand the comparisons to Gone Girl  but for me  the characters weren t as distinctive in this novel as they were in Gone Girl  The voices of the three main characters sounded a lot alike   a little more variation in speech  delivery  etc  might have helped make them sound a bit more distinctive  That said  I do think this is a strong debut  and I look forward to what this author brings into the world next  This book has enjoyed much success since its publication  Any time a book gets that much hype  I have some concern about whether any book can measure up to the expectations of a hype  This one actually does Rachel once had a life that offered all the advantages  She had the good marriage  a decent job  and she was very much in control of her life  But that was the Rachel who existed before this book opens  The Rachel we meet is a woman who is jobless but who pretends to go to work each day on the train  She s living off what s left of a savings account and living on booze and very little else  She drinks to the point at which she has blackouts and can t remember significant pieces of her life  It is the alcohol that makes her completely unreliable  and the author writes the character such that her unreliability leaves the reader guessing While commuting on the train  she travels through the neigrhood where she and her former husband lived  He still lives there with his new wife  and when Rachel is particularly boozed up  she frequently makes contact with him  The train always stops briefly in front of a house near where she once lived  and Rachel gets glimpses of the couple who live there  Based on those glimpses  she makes up names and lives for the couple  She romanticizes their lives  and one day she is shocked when she sees the woman kissing someone else  Within days of the elicit kiss  the woman goes missing  and Rachel has vague memories of what happened  but they won t surface This is a book about obsession and lies  It is excellently narrated by three narrators who take the points of view of each of three women  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  the current wife of Rachel s former husband This is a twisty tangled swooping diving plot that is highly readable  I certainly didn t expect the ending  and I finished it the same day I began it  Really quick page turner  A good psychological thriller that will appeal to a mass market  If you like to be part of the conversation read this  I think everyone else is or will be too   Better than Gone Girl  At least kept me unsure for a good portion of the book  although it became a little  hoping for a screenplay  esque towards the end  Rachel  still raw after her divorce  travels past her former home twice a day on the commuter train  She becomes interested in an ideal couple living in a house a few doors down from where she used to live  concocting an idyllic life for the two  Then the wife disappears  and Rachel finds herself obsessed with the mystery    where has she gone  What has happened  Can she help the grieving husband find answers and deflect suspicion away from him  Convinced she has seen things from the train that give her extra insight into the couple  she inserts herself into the investigation  Meanwhile Anna  Rachel s ex husband s new wife  contributes to the narrative  giving us a different view of Rachel and her motives  and making no bones about the fact that she views Rachel s intervention as an attempt to stalk her family  In chapters alternating between Anna  Rachel  and Megan  the woman who has disappeared from her perfect life  the book gives us 3 different points of view of the story    none of which prepares us for the book s shocking finale  This one started slow for me  It sort of made me  sad  because none of the characters are all that likable  I kept going and it did get better  It feels redundant at times  but perhaps that s the point  routine and memory and what it does to us   I felt weird at the end    maybe as a result of reading too much chick lit that ends on a happy note  If you like mysteries and compelling storytelling  this is a great book  it isn t a light read by any means  but it draws you in  I m glad I stuck with it  Twisted bizarre crazy good read but difficult to follow characters and keep them straight Un bel giallo  ben scritto e ben costruito  Un po  prevedibile sul finale e forse con una serie di protagonisti dalle  improbabili  vicissitudini  tutti radunati nella stessa strada   Na Divku ve vlaku jsem byla hodne zvedava  reklama byla obrovska  Nemam rada prirovnavani  tady se neustale mluvilo o nove Zmizele  od

u me nedoslo k uplnemu zhltnuti konce  protoze to pro me bylo uz jen dovysvetleni a ne sokovani a myslim  ze to tak bude mit vetsina lidi  Motiv vlaku  sledovani  fantazirovani a samotna ctivost je ale urcite plusem  Pribeh se vsak nevyhne jistym klise  popr  temat a motivu pro tyto knihy tak typicke  ktere nic noveho neprinesou Jako celek hodnotim slabsimi 4 hvezdickami  ale jsem rada  ze jsem si to precetla   Come on ride the train   ride it  Such a good mystery  I probably would have finished it in a couple of days if I had not been sick  I recommend this page turner   Well done  I did get a little tired of Rachel s whining  but I couldn t decide who d  done it  until the end   Rear Window  meets  Gone Girl  in a really interesting who dunnit  I loved the intricate web of connections and trying to figure out who committed the crime  My only complaint is that I have trouble abiding by a main character that can t get on with life because they can t stop drinking  Argh  I felt like launching my own intervention  I adored this book  Maybe it s because I haven t read a lot of crime fiction lately  and I miss it  Perhaps it s my deep and abiding love for English murder mysteries  Or maybe I was just in the mood for exactly this book  Whatever the reason  I devoured Paula Hawkins   The Girl on the Train  in a few days  First thing you need to know  it takes Hawkins a while to hit her stride  The first quarter of the book is a little slow and disjointed  mostly because of the plot structure  Hawkins moves between Rachel and Megan s points of view and  in the beginning  there s no real link between the two women  I found myself entertained  but less than engaged  and occasionally bored   by the beginning Then  Hawkins brings the narrative threads together and adds another  Anna  specifically   Suddenly  there s a purpose and direction to the story that coalesces into a gathering dread as Rachel   and we   slowly come to understand the truth  Now  none of the characters are particularly likeable  Rachel is pathetic  but that s as close as it gets  Megan is a charming  selfish adolescent  and Anna is conventional and boring  Yet we want to know what happens to them  We want them to be okay  That s a testament to Hawkins  talent  She never shies away from her characters  flaws   in fact  she inflates them   but she doesn t define them by their flaws  either  They are fully realized people  The shifting perspectives also allow us to experience what each character experiences  We re more sympathetic than perhaps we should be because we see through their eyes  My only complaint  really  is that the voices are too similar  Hawkins does a respectable job of differentiating tone and texture  but she could have done more  Clearer linguistics quirks  patterns of speech  cadences  would have been appreciated Overall  though   The Girl on the Train  is a very satisfying read  Fans of crime fiction  and particularly English murder mysteries  are in for a treat   I really liked this book  I read it over two days and it really kept me guessing   A well constructed thriller  combining unreliable narrators  a complicated series of jumps through time and perspective and a slightly too obvious twist  Immensely readable and hard to put down  What a wonderful  moving grip taking story that pulls you in   You know  to be honest  I don t know exactly how I feel about this book  Was it good  Yes  Did it become slightly predictable  Yes  I struggled with the protagonist s persistent self pity and immaturity  I kept thinking about those horror movies when you yell at the girl  don t go in there   and she does anyway  But  I guess all of that was 100  necessary to make the plot successful  So  like I said    In not sure how I feel about this one  I can  however  understand the popularity after Gone Girl  Het boek mag dan een hype zijn dit moment  en hier komt nog eens een cliche  het leest als een trein  In twee dagen had ik het uit  Vakantielectuur  spannend  behoorlijk uitgewerkte personages  al is de plot niet bijster origineel  Goed geschreven  dus toch vier sterren   This is what i call a terrific book  You get drawn into the lives of the characters  and are left wondering whether things are indeed as they seem  Artfully crafted  One feels for the protagonist from the first chapter onward  The book piques your interest  The ending could have been less facile than it is  Except that  it is an eminently good read and connoisseurs of crime  thrillers would get a bang out of this one  Great job Paula   A psychological thriller that is addictive  I could not put it done until I knew what happened  Kept me guessing until the end  Despues de haber leido y escuchado tantas criticas  la mayoria no tan buenas  me daba un poco de miedo comenzar con esta historia  Creia que me costaria avanzar y que la lectura me resultaria muy tediosa pero fue todo lo contrario  Me encanto de principio a fin  el progreso que hace la protagonista  no solamente en el asesinato de Megan sino tambien en su vida es impresionante  Mientras lo leia me iba formando algunas ideas en la cabeza de quien podia ser el asesino pero la autora logro que sospechara de absolutamente todos los personajes  No me sorprendio totalmente cuando supe quien habia sido pero me gusto que se haya desarrollado de esa forma Fue una lectura bastante ligera y atrapante  no podia dejar de leer porque cada pagina era mas y mas interesante Otra cosa que me gusto mucho fue que la historia estuviera narrada desde el punto de vista de tres personajes  eso hizo que no solo se viera la evolucion del personaje de Rachel sino tambien de la victima  Megan  Con este personaje me paso de que cuanto mas conocia su historia mas pensaba que todo lo que le habia pasado se lo habia buscado porque de cierta manera no habia sido una buena persona  pero el cambio que tiene y que haya terminado como termino si me llego a dar bastante lastima  Todos los personajes tuvieron un final acorde a lo que habia sucedido anteriormente Un libro muy recomendable  First read by this author  I can see why they compare it to Gone Girl  I think it was a bit better than gone girl  The 3 ladies  telling the story  which took awhile to get  were interesting  I will definitely be looking for more books by Paula Hawkins  Kept me interested and going back for more  I really enjoyed reading this book  however  the character development of the main character didn t seem realistic to me  Though I thought it would  the story didn t challenge me or make me question things  I rated this book a 4 because I never got bored and was forced to turn the page by the gripping details and surprises  It s a good read for a vacation   This is a page turner  I read it in one day because I couldn t put it down  Rachel is an unreliable narrator who rides the same train day after day  she also sees the same people day after day and starts to make up stories about their lives  Then one day she witnesses something and becomes involved in the people s lives she has been fantasizing about for years  This is one you won t want to miss  Very nice whodunit with Hawkins doing an excellent job of spinning and turning and weaving the storytelling through the eyes of a few differentcharacters  so the reader is constantly given new info and constantly being caught off guard          in my opinion author Hawkins pays wonderful homage to both Hitchcock s STRANGERS ON A TRAIN and REAR WINDOW  beautifully describing what heroine Rachel thinks she is witnessing  and many timesplacing the reader on a commuter train ride that  like the plot  takes unpredictable  tension filled sharp turns   Bravo Paula        This book has been heralded as the new Gone Girl and I can see why  Rachel is a lost soul  a woman who pretends to take the train to work every day so she doesn t have to tell her flatmate she got sacked for being drunk  On the way she goes past her former street  where her ex husband  Tom  is now living with the woman he cheated on her with  Anna  She also regularly sees a happy couple and imagines their lovely life but things take a turn when he sees the woman  Megan  with another man  Next thing Rachel knows Megan has gone missing and her husband Scott is in the frame for her murder  So it starts pretty much like Gone Girl then  What follows is a narrative from three not quite mentally stable women  Rachel  Megan and Anna  The police investigation gathers pace and Rachel can t help but get involved  despite the fact the case doesn t really have anything to do with her  Except there s a hint it might  On the night Megan disappeared Rachel was nearby  drunkenly heading to see her ex husband  But when drinking she often suffers from blackouts and can t remember what happened  It very much has an element of Before I Go to Sleep About It  The best thing about this book is the mystery and the fact it could be any of the characters  Gone Girl is really about whether Nick is responsible or not but this really asks the question of who it could be  I think I suspected every single character of the book at some point and I still wasn t certain who it was even when it was revealed  It has an interesting narrative structure  telling the story from either the morning or evening train journeys  It s a decent idea but I m not overly convinced it worked  mainly because most of the book is set before or after these times  I enjoyed the book but I couldn t help thinking about Gone Girl the whole time  Yes  it s a different story but I feel like Hawkins meant to write a Gone Girl type book when she started this  It starts with a missing woman and sees characters looking suspicious about her disappearance  Plus there s a hint of Before I Go to Sleep for good measure  as well as the blackouts there s a character who is a therapist which feels oddly familiar   It has the tension and the great characters of Gone Girl but for me it didn t have the originality that Gone Girl had  It s a writing exercise where the authors starts with the premise of Gone Girl and tells a different story  A good story though and one that will really keep you guessing  Naik kereta api     tut     tut     tutSiapa hendak turutKe Bandung     SurabayaBolehlah naik dengan percumaAyo temanku lekas naikKeretaku tak berhenti lama

yang telah ia perbuat  Ternyata ia juga memiliki andil dalam hilangnya Megan meski tidak langsung  Ups     ini dari sisi pandang saya lho  Love this book  Amazing   worth the read  very twisted and dark characters you really can t feel for and yet you feel for the sadness in them  the book surprised me  not for the dark tone but for the gritty realism of Rachel and her sad life  it was just real and easy to see how someone so lost could get so caught up and confused in the world around her  I don t want to share much about the plot so not to spoil but a good story if you re looking for something to catch you  I loved the first three quarters of the book and couldn t wait to pick it up  It s clear why this is the book that everyone is reading  However  I found the ending to be a let down  I honestly felt like I was reading the screen play for a made for TV movie the way the villain explains everything he did and the way the climax all comes together  It just felt a little too contrived after what was a great psychological thriller for most of the book  On the fence between 3 5 and 4 stars   Well  after all the hype  it turned out to be just the twisty  turny thriller I hoped it would be  Heartbreaking at times  there are some very messed   up people in this story  Very difficult to put down  Another offering in the rather new genre of Chick Noir  a k a  Domestic Noir or Amnesia Thrillers   in which domestic life is no longer the safe place everyone assumes it will be  Unreliable women as narrators are hot right now  think Gone Girl  The Silent Wife  The Devil You Know  as well as The Girl on the Train   Chick Noir is aimed at women  mirroring Chick Lit   but there is no happily ever after and husbands are not necessarily people whom women are able to trust The novel is told from the points of view of 3 women  Rachel  the alcoholic ex wife   Anna  the irritated current wife   and Megan  the woman next door   Along with the differing interpretations of events that you would expect from three different people  we also learn that there is truth to the old saying that those outside a marriage really have no idea what is going on within that marriage  this proves true for all three women It s difficult to say anything substantial about the plot without giving away the fun bits  so I will resist the temptation to say too much  This is a 4 star read instead of 5 for me because I guessed the who dunnit about 2 3 of the way through the book  I really like to be kept guessing  The Girl on the Train  really  couldn t it have been The Woman on the Train  Rachel is well over 16   puts the fun in dysfunctional  The whole time I read this book  I was thinking  this would be so much better if I was stuck on an 8 hour flight   It s like when we order Big Star tacos at work sometimes for lunch  They re great tacos  but I can t help but think  these would be so much better if I was drunk and it was nighttime   I suppose my point is that this book is great for what it is  an airport read  and beyond that  it has little to offer  I m never going to give it a re read  I mean  I d say it s a little long  at a certain point I was like  okay I get it already  move the story along FFS   But to Hawkins s credit  I kept on keeping on  and sincerely wanted to know whodunnit  Good airport book  There is a creeper Girl on the Train who makes it a habit to follow the lives of people she sees from her vantage point on her daily commute  all of whom are just minding their own business in their own homes which are unfortunately situated within viewing distance from the train tracks  Over time  she has become all wrapped up in the stories she has created for them in her increasingly muddled psyche Read my full review here  http   bit ly 1AXeu6z Whoa  first  I don t typically read books focused on affairs  alcoholism  or murder  This one  though  grabbed me at 9 00 this morning and held me captive until I finished the novel tonight  Twice a day  I am offered a view into other lives  just for a moment  There s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home   Life is not a paragraph  and death is no parenthesis   have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts  Who was it said that following your heart is a good thing  It is pure egotism  a selfishness to conquer all   This book just totally kicked me in the face  I was in such a reading slump  have been for the last few weeks  but then my library dropped me a message saying this book was in  Thank God  There is nothing quite like a Mystery or Thriller to drag you out of a slump  It was just what I need  Such a fun story  seeing all the different perspectives and timelines  trying as I always do to figure it out before the end  loving the game  All the little twists and reveals along the way were wonderful  I stayed up all night to finish it and I don t regret a single minute  4 5 stars  What a great mystery  I understand that a lot of people are disappointed that it was compared to Gone Girl but ended up not being like it  Shouldn t that be a good thing  I don t want to read the same story twice Paula Hawkins did a nice job leading the reader down several different thought trails in this book  the writing was spot on and the way the story unfolded was excellent  It is the type of book that makes you want to pick up more mysteries and get your detective on Read it before the movie comes out  y all   Reviewed by Helen Goltz for The Reviewers This was an entertaining read with enough twists and turns to engage the reader  I wish I had read the book before the hype so I could judge it on its merits and not be influenced by its accolades  For me  it doesn t live up to the hype  it s no Gone Girl  but that s not to say I didn t enjoy it I wonder how big an impact the catchy title has attributed to its success  I picked it up expecting it to be in the mould of a  Hitchcock  Rear Window story The characters are believable  and even though Rachel s personal decline in health and self esteem is understandable  I still wanted to grab her by the shoulders and give her a good shake  If you are craving a good character driven novel with plenty of intrigue  then definitely read The Girl on the Train  Your thoughts  De inicio a final  pura intriga en este libro  Muy bueno  Quickshot ReviewI enjoyed it  Unreliable narrators certainly make it more interesting to figure out what is the truth and it is a fascinating study on a person s perception of their lives vs other people s view of them  The prose is solid  there is an excitement to find out what happens  but in the end I didn t care that much about two cheating hos and a sad  sad drunk  If you re into thrillers though  I d recommend it  from kalireads com Beautiful sunshine  cloudless skies  no one to play with  nothing to do  Living like this  the way I m living at the moment  is harder in the summer when there is so much daylight  so little cover of darkness  when everyone is out and about  being flagrantly  aggressively happy  It s exhausting  and it makes you feel bad if you re not joining in  The Girl on the Train  Paula Hawkins That s Rachel  the main character in Paula Hawkins  hit thriller The Girl on the Train  lamenting her alcoholism  her early morning drinking habits  She likes to drink on the train on the way into the city  she likes to drink on the way home  This isn t working well for Rachel her life  you could say  is in shambles When the train stops  she peers through the windows at a beautiful home  number fifteen  her favorite  A bit of a peeping tom  or just a harmless fantasist  Rachel gazes upon the beautiful couple within  She admires them  their perfect lives  She glances at the wife on the balcony  the husband getting ready for work When the woman from number fifteen appears on the news as Meagan  gone missing  Rachel s fantasist ways kick into action  She inserts herself in the investigation  becoming miraculously  eerily close to Scott  the missing woman s desperate husband  Rachel s own troubles  bumps and bruises she can t remember receiving  evenings lost to drink that she knows didn t go well  hang heavy over her desire to help  She hopes those blanks don t somehow coincide with Megan s disappearance The Girl on the Train alternates with each of the female characters narrating  Rachel at the center  and Megan and her neighbor  Anna  coming into and out of focus  I found this confusing at the start  I was listening on audiobook  and all the pert names blurred together  Jess  Rachel  Anna  Kathy  Megan   Once I attached a name to a character in the story  I was off and running Comparisons to Gone Girl are coming hot and heavy  but where Gone Girl is twisty  The Girl on the Train is slow and stabbing  with Rachel desperately flailing to fill in her own blank spaces  The endless fans of Gone Girl will surely enjoy The Girl on the Train  But as this awesome Irish Times article points out  this isn t just the era of Gillian Flynn  This is an era of women writing women driven thrillers  Gillian Flynn  Tana French  Megan Abbott  Samantha Hayes  And now  Paula Hawkins   A tiding of magpies  One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl  four for a boy  five for silver  six for gold  seven for a secret never to be told  I completed the last quarter of this book while I was in a train myself  I finished the book and I sighed  It was past midnight  For a long time after that  I stared at the trees and fields and the glittering houses that rushed past  The wind soothed my face and I found myself wondering what stories unravel in these homes  None as convoluted and unnerving as the one I just read  I suppose This book is exactly what it says in the blurbs  This changes the way you look at people Rachel takes the same train everyday  She creates a story about one of the houses which she comes across on the way  That is a way of life for her  She does not have a job  Her marraige has been dissolved  She is a hopeless alcoholic  or hopeless she seems  She sees something someday  and that changes her past  her present  and her future  And of those around her  What follows is an amazing tale of suspense  mystery  and intrigue  A very satisfying psychological thriller  It has all the elements  and in perfect balance  It is a very fine psychological study with messed up characters  A very pacy read  I loved the character sketches  One of the finest in a while  The climax was engaging  The comparison to Gone Girl is not baseless  I would have been so disappointed if it was an overrated read  I had to read three fourths of the book before I figured out THE person  And that is saying something  Go on  read this one  if psychological thrillers are your thing  Prvych asi 40 stran trosku slabsich  ale potom to zacalo byt lepsie az na koniec som to nechcel pustit z ruky  Ani sa nenazdate a otacate poslednu stranku Rozhodne odporucam 18 z 20 prstov  Tie dva ostatne sa pridali na stranu rebelov      This book was really good  for most of it  I m sad to report that the ending was a bit of a letdown  I don t know why Hawkins chose to go for the cliche ending but she did and so I left the book feeling slightly disappointed  There s so many other ways that Hawkins could have chosen to take this story  For most of the book  she does a great job of crafting a suspenseful  Hitchcockian thriller  That s why I am so sad that she lost steam at the end  This book has been compared to Gone Girl and I think that s a rather apt comparison  In fact  it felt a little too similar to Gone Girl which makes me wonder if Gillian Flynn should sue  Regardless  this is still a well written thriller with plenty of twists  Just don t expect to be that shocked by the ending     4 5 stars   I LOVED THIS  I generally don t read many crime mystery books  in fact Gone Girl is the only one I ve read recently   but I hands down think this is my new favourite genre  I loved how the characters in this novel were just so real and flawed and so IMperfect  that they were perfect  In fact  the repulsion that we feel when we meet the majority of characters in this book  in my opinion  makes them that much more interesting and wholesome  I think personally I related to this book a lot more than other books  like GG   because it was set in England and the characters were so British and therefore more believable  for me  anyway   The story may have seemed a bit drab at times  likeEnglish weather   but it kept me hooked and I thoroughly enjoyed it  The ending was actually a shocker  even though I kinda figured it out before it was made glaringly obvious  I ve seen so many negative reviews and 1 2 stars for this but I think people need to chill out and stop saying its a complete gone girl rip off  it has its similarities but ultimately it s completely different   but whatevs  I personally loved it and I defo want to read more books like this  This was a really well written book  The characters  especially Rachel  were written very strong  I would have been content just to hear all of the book from Rachel s perspective  rather than having the narration jump around a bit  My only concern was it felt like the author threw too many curveballs to try to get you to guess who dun it  Although  that could also be because this book was billed as the next Gone Girl  so I was looking for the hook  the catch  And I guessed the ending before it was literally spelt out for me  but I was still satisfied  Any book that keeps you reading when you re in the middle is a winner to me  The back of this book made me think it was a horrorstory or something  but the title made me think was some deep story about a girl  It was kinda both  It is a  psychological   thriller  You get to follow Rachel who has a pretty sad life and kinda just makes herself the detective of a crime  You also get to read the story of two other women who also suffers in some ways    But i did like that  I did feel the characters were interesting  even though a bit similar  I just liked that besides the mysterycrime  you got a deeper story of the actual people involved  Also i did not figure out who the bad guy was until the end  I had my theories  and i argued with Rachels theories underway  I did not really like that i was set up like a diary  that was clearly not a diary  I just feel like it was little point in the morning evening parting  I get that it s because of the train rides  but after a while it just gets pointless  She even talks about the day before in the current day  so    And maybe a little cliche dialoge some places  But overall i really liked it  I got worked up at the end      Girl on a Train  was totally not what I expected it to be  but I really enjoyed reading it  It turned out to be a little along the lines of  The Rear Window  with a lot of the same undertones as  Gone Girl   Ultimately  it ended up to be about marriages gone wrong  and how lies and deception can lead to the unthinkable  While I didn t find any of the characters to be likable  it was very well written and engaging  this is a good book if you like reading psychological thrillers or crime novels  Good suspense storyFun page turner  Reminiscent of  Gone Girl  as many reviewers have noted  Insightful portrayal of the nature of alcoholism and the insidiousness of abusive relationships  Auto einai to proto biblio tes Pola Khokins  to opoio kuklophorese se Amerike kai Agglia ton Ianouario tou 2015

woman commuting to and from her work passes the time making up lives to the people that she sees in the houses lining the railway  During one of those trips she sees something odd  the next day the woman of that house goes missing  Of course she feels she should report this but in doing so it places her into the glaring eyes of the police and in the middle of the investigation ReviewAt first I was wondered if this book was aimed more to women as it was told from the mind set of three different female perspectives  It took till about halfway before I could really begin to associate myself with the characters but from there the pacing was nicely done and jumping from narrator to narrator only sets up several mini cliffhangers all the way till the satisfying end I have recommended it to a few friends  first time in a long time  as I feel it would span quite a few different genres  Its a satisfying ending worth sticking around for  I am also looking forward to seeing what they do with the movie  although I will always be glad I read the book first The Girl on the TrainPaula Hawkins Rachel was definitely me at one point in my life  sad and wishing I had another womans life  I still do that sometimes  but Rachel had such a warmness about her even when she was going a little stalkerish about her ex husband  Needless to say she was a very loveable character  Her story starts on the train into London which stops at a red light at the same time every day  allowing her to glimpse into the lives of the houses opposite  She even goes as far as naming the people she sees there but there is one house she refuses to look at  It flips between the train there  the train back and her walk in through a friends flat  As it starts to move on she sees something that makes her mind whirl  Rachel becomes obsessed with finding out who what where and when  she even gets caught up with the police but one thing I never expected was the horrific  although pleasantly surprising ending  The story really takes off when she wakes up one morning  brushed and bloody with no recollection of anything  Not even how she got home  She then discovers one of the people living in the house a few doors down from her ex husbands had been murdered on the night she lost her memory  Rachel is unable to keep her obsessive nature from finding out the truth  We meet Rachels ex husband  Tom s wife Anna and these three women all get entangled together as the sporty goes on  however their ability to get through the terrifying ordeal is remarkable  I have to say the ending to this book took me by surprise it was written so well  and it s definitely worth the read  I m usually pretty good at guessing the endings to book but this one  blew my mind  I loved it  Also published on redlittleboots blogspot co uk Rachel is disturbed on many levels  She became broken years ago when she realized she couldn t conceive a baby and become a mother  Instead of seeking psychological help  she turned to the bottle  And like one domino knocking down another  the booze caused her relationship with her husband  Tom  to dissolve  Frustrated by her constant drinking  he turned to Anna  Now he is married to Anna and they have a baby daughter  but Rachel has a difficult time leaving them alone  She still thinks of Tom as her husband  Her drinking also caused her to lose her job  Now  she goes on the train to London every morning as if she is still employed so that her landlady  Cathy  won t be concerned about the rent Rachel lives more in her thoughts about other people than in her own life  On the train  she makes up stories about the people in the houses in Corly Wood as the train passes through  In fact  she used to live in one of those houses with Tom  He s still there with his new family  Five houses down from there  she envisions the life of Jason and Jess  They are so much in love  she can just tell  Then  one Friday  she sees Jess kissing someone other than Jason  The next morning  the woman disappears  From the news  she finds their real names are Scott and Megan Hipwell  On that same morning  Rachel has injuries for which she can t remember the cause  She has only fragmented memories of Friday evening  She was in Corly Wood Our protagonist is not a young  beautiful  and near perfect person  In fact  she s let herself go  She s overweight  she wears no makeup  and she practically stays drunk  Most of the chapters are told from Rachel s perspective  but there are chapters from Megan and Anna s perspective as well  Everyone has their fair share of secrets and it all comes pleasantly to a surprising ending  I liked the character of Rachel  only because I got to know her through the chapters devoted to her  I can understand why she frustrated so many people  She appeared to be in everybody s business and wouldn t seek help for her alcohol abuse  Rating  4 out of 5  This psychological thriller is full of twist and turns  It will make you want more  Highly recommended  Perfect for a stay home weekend  Great writing by Paula Hawkins  Great mystery  Interesting characters   I don t usually think of novels as page turners  but  The Girl on the Train  is a page turner of the first rank  It was difficult to put down  The author  Paula Hawkins  uses three female narrators  each deeply flawed  to spin a yarn of unhealthy relationships  self destructive behavior  deception  and murder  By jumping back and forth between the present and the past  she forces the reader to pay close attention or become lost as events play out  I finished the book about 30 minutes before yesterday s Super Bowl kickoff  I m glad I didn t have to make a choice between the book and the game  This was a good  quick read  The chapters alternate between two characters perspectives throughout much of the book  which makes it interesting to try to piece the story together  The author s depiction of Rachel and her alcoholism is really well done  The way she explains the yearning  shame  guilt and downward spiral of her feelings is great  The story has plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing and although the story is wrapped up in the end  it definitely keeps you thinking  Highly recommend this book  Gone Girl und The Girl on the Train haben beide  Girl  im Titel und legen ihren Fokus auf  komplexe Thrillerfrauen   Demnach MUSS es ja ein Plagiat sein  Sind schliesslich zwei vom Leben gebeutelte Frauen die ein bisschen trinken  einige Tobsuchtanfalle haben und eben alles besitzen  was eine Frau erst komplex macht    Also manchmal konnte ich einigen 40  Redakteuren die Bucher um die Ohren hauen  Bin jetzt nicht abnormal engagiert fur Frauenrechte  aber wieso kann eine Frau denn nur aufregend sein wenn sie ein American Psycho ist Wer GOOT namlich mal wirklich gelesen hat  der wird schnell merken  dass unsere Protagonistin Rachel ganz anders ist als Amy  Naturlich ist sie kriminell verwegen  aber vorallem ihre Verletztheit  ist das uberhaupt ein Wort   macht Rachel zu schaffen GOOT erzahlt  warum Rachel sich von Filmriss zu Filmriss bewegt  warum sie in einem Zug sitzt um ihren Ex   die Neue zu beobachten  warum sie sich zur Dauerlugnerin gewandelt hat und wie das alles mit dem Verschwinden der jungen Megan zu tun hat  Dieses Zug Stalking entwickelt sich zunehmend zum perfiden Beziehungsterror  und deswegen hat selbstverstandlich jemand Tode hinzunehmen  Alles was dazwischen kommt wird halbwegs nuchtern preisgegeben und thematisiert Dinge die eigentlich ganz topaktuell sind  Bei den 3 verschiedenen POVs weiss man ganz ehrlich nicht wie man denken soll  Man fuhlt sich generell dauerverarscht  weil so viele im Buch so egoistisch sind und irgendwie nur einen ganz kleinen Horizont haben  Jeder lugt  aber wirklich  jeder  Dabei ist Rachel zum Beispiel so herzzereissend abgefuckt  dass es schonwieder     ja  sympathisch ist  Trotz ihrem Versagen und ihrer Unperfektheiten tragt sie ihre eigenen Massstabe und Stolz  Es ist wirklich traurig zu lesen  wie sie noch tiefer rutscht und aus Lust und Laune von xy beleidigt wird  Mag sie schrag sein wie sie will  sie tat mir echt leid und ich hoffe ja dass sie s schafft  _ Allein weil ich wissen wollte wie es mit ihr ausgeht hab ich die Story binnen 2 Tagen verschlungen  Schnell hat mans durch  weil Hawkins nicht viel Zeit in ihrer Erzahlung verschwendet  Bis zum Ende fiebert der Leser mit  fuhlt ALLE Fuhle und ist glucklich oder frustriert  weil man am Anfang schon die richtige Vermutung hatte  Wie sagen die Deutschen das immer so eklig   Ganz grosses Kino    und hey  das wars auch ohne ein Gone Girl2 zu sein An der Stelle mochte ich nur als einziges Manko kritisieren  dass die Manner vergleichsweise unkomplex waren  Manche Tode muss man wohl sterben    This  Is  Good This  Is  Great I mean I can t put this novel down  I keep reading and read  except when the customers came and I just think   fast    faster    Thank you so much  now I ll have to go back to my novel  AH  But why I give this 4 stars  Well it actually 4 5 stars  Cause when it come to the climax  one customers came and sit  SIT and TALKING TO ME   I mean  I like being accompany but WHY WHEN THAT TIME LIKE THIS    like that  when I just want read  finish this  and close the Expo And before she left  came another customers  and another either   I have to happy  right  That the books sold  But     Well  after that I have to closing the Expo and some regulation that have done before I closed it  It was 5 30 pm  Time to go home So I gone home  and wait for some hours  you know  the best time to read and not getting for any interference  and read it just for a half hour  the longest is one hour So I get the conflict but it became more like anti climax for me  Er  He died  Then    a month later                     Well  just see the blurb itself or synopsis from another goodreaders who more diligent to write the synopsis                      But I finished this in two days  400 pages  Proud of You have to read this And I kinda interested how this novel become a movie  Well  I guess  I can see how it going    view spoiler   view spoiler   view spoiler  But  Paula  why Gaskill not you give more roles in here   I already like him  you know  and he not getting any more important role after Anna more trust Riley than G  And I always said   stupid Anna    stupid Megan  And why you didn t give more explanation for Kamal  And actually I know with who Megan Jess get  shared   and who s the murderer  Paula have give you so many hints  So I became   Ah  I knew it    hide spoiler    hide spoiler    hide spoiler   Wow  that was quite a ride  Well done mystery  although I maintain that the omniscient POV is not one I like  In thinking through this whole crazy plot  though  there didn t seem to be another effective way to tell the story  I must admit  I had to keep reading  keep reading to find out just what happened that night with Megan  And I certainly didn t come close to figuring it out  At times  I believed anyone could have killed her  Except Kathy  ha Tight and vivid writing that keeps you on the edge of your seat  Sorry  cliqued  Thx to M  Lynn for the recommendation  Recensione completa su On Rainy DaysUn thriller fenomenale dalla prima all ultima pagina  che conquista nel mettere perennemente in scacco le certezze del lettore      Il thriller di Paula Hawkins sconvolge e intriga per la semplicita del pretesto narrativo  per la sorprendente e disarmante umanita delle tre voci narranti e per la costante fame di sapere che attanaglia leggendo le 308 pagine del romanzo Dico semplicita per descrivere il fatto che mette in moto e intreccia le vite di Rachel  Megan  Scott  Anna e Tom perche una delle azioni piu comuni e semplici per raggiungere Londra dalle citta in periferia e usare il treno  ed e proprio attorno alla vecchia linea che passa accanto alle case di Witney che la storia prende forma e si sviluppa  diventando poco a poco sempre piu complessa  meno lineare e meno scontata      L avere tre punti di vista diversi incastrati attorno a una misteriosa scomparsa non fa che mettere in dubbio le certezze che si crede di aver conquistato poche pagine indietro  Ci si rimette in discussione capitolo dopo capitolo e si perde la cognizione del tempo  Volete sapere  dovete assolutamente sapere cosa e accaduto davvero perche leggendo ci si sente un po  come Rachel  l immagine e sfocata  sembra quasi un sogno  ma sappiamo di aver intravisto qualcosa  la soluzione e a portata di mano ma non riusciamo ad afferrarla  This book manages to create a sinister mood without stating that the characters are ever in any danger  at least until the climax  when the danger is definitely present   It s something about having an incredibly vulnerable yet untrustworthy narrator that makes this quite unique  It s very difficult to like any of the characters  and finishing the book left me feeling quite empty  but it s still an incredibly interesting and well written book  Maybe don t read before bed time though   I  read  this on audiobook  My first attempt at listening to fiction  For the longest time I viewed audiobooks with an heir of snobbery that I couldn t possibly enjoy or get into a book by listening  However I have a friend who swears by them so I figured I couldn t decide I didn t like them without even trying  I think that had I tried to read this text  the first part would have been boring and difficult to get through  However I put this on during my long walks and found the narrators voices pulling me into the story  It took much longer to finish than when I physically read book  and by the end I really found myself wanting to put in my earbuds and hear what happened next  I recommend getting the audio version and setting out for a long walk  Girl on the train by Paula Hawkins is one of those books you would love to have on your bookshelf  The biggest reason why is that you cannot call yourself a book nerd if you have not read this one  Now  most authors would want their protagonists to be interesting people with interesting lives  Paula Hawkins  however  went for Rachel  an alcoholic with the most mechanical life you could possibly imagine  What is most ironic here is that this book is a top notch thriller with the first few chapters being quite dull and grey  it successfully creates an illusion of normalcy  of nothing seeming to be out of place  Just when you are being lulled into monotony  you come face to face with the turning point of the plot and suddenly everything becomes ten times more interesting  The reader s curiosity deepens with every page he turns  he quickly reaches the point where the book becomes  unputdownable   Explaining the plot would most definitely ruin the read  and hence  I ve decided to explain the character of Rachel  our Girl on the Train  As mentioned earlier she is not built of the usual protagonist material  A person with some serious flaws  Rachel is a divorcee who has sought refuge in alcohol  She drinks excessively and this costs her  her job  Afraid that her apartment owner would not want to have a jobless tenant  Rachel takes a train to London every day pretending that she goes to work  On one of those routine journeys  she sees something from the carriage window that shatters the monotony of her life  It s only for a brief moment  not even a paragraph but a mere sentence that forms the turning point in the plot  What is most interesting about the book is the writing style  The reader is compelled to see the picture through the eyes of three different women  Rachel  Anna and Megan  and is compelled to adapt himself to the constantly changing time frame of the plot  Towards the end of the book  the reader is left with random pieces of a puzzle with ABSOLUTELY no idea where each piece fits in the bigger picture  Only when the reader completely finishes the book  can he enjoy the satisfaction of having solved the puzzle  And this is what sets a true thriller apart from the rest  Reading this book is like sitting on a roller coaster ride  you can resume breathing normally only when you finish reading it  By that time  Rachel would have easily gotten herself a place on your  Unforgettable Fictional Characters  list  enough to show that she is more than just a girl on the train  Just my kind of book  Twists   turns that make you pop life on hold  til you ve finished it  Fab  Do recommend it but not if you ve got anything that you actually need to do   Es una novela que me ha mantenido en tension en todos y cada uno de sus capitulos  A pesar del inesperado final  creo que le ha faltado algo  quizas deberia haber terminado de otra forma  extenderse un poco mas  creo que podria haber sido mas currado  En mi opinion fue a un final hecho a toda prisa  Aun asi lo recomiendo  mucho ademas  al ser un Thriller que te deja con la boca abierta y con el corazon latiendo a toda prisa     I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts  Who was it said that following your heart is a good thing  It is pure egotism  a selfishness to conquer all   I am a peaceful person  I ve never punched anyone  For all my colorful language  I am pretty fucking nice  Rarely angry  I like to think I am a good person The Girl on the Train is about the worst parts of people  It s a complex  exciting thriller that isn t afraid to showcase the characters in the worst possible light  Also all three of the narrators are woman  wonderfully complex and deeply difficult to like  That s so rare So  to get to my main point  I liked Rachel  And I fucking hated her My dad s an alcoholic  My worst fear  worse than snakes and rejection is becoming a lonely  rage filled alcoholic  I love my dad  He is an amazing person  But I don t want that  I don t like who I am when I drink too much  I don t think Rachel did either  Was Rachel a good person  I don t know  I m not sure if she knew  I hate her because I don t ever want to be her  but damn if I wasn t rooting for her too This book has a great plot  stellar pacing  and it was exciting and twisty and everything a good thriller should be  But the characters  they are the kind of characters that leave me wondering if I m truly a good person deep down in the pit of my innards  or my soul  or where ever Okay  second point  A happy point  I FIGURED OUT THE ENDING  Y all  this is monumental for me  I never  ever guess the ending to anything  I don t usually mind  I like surprises  But I also like being right  So  way to go self  You solved the mystery  Calm down self  You solved a fictional mystery 75  of the way through  It s not the achievement of the century  So  to the fifty bazillion people who said   You like to read right  Have you read The Girl on the Train yet    Oh  you haven t  Well  can I borrow it when you re done   Yes  it was awesome and thanks for suggesting it and no you can t borrow it because last time you borrowed Gone Girl it disappeared for 6 months Now I ll go back to being irrationally proud of myself for my mystery solving skills and start planning my Nancy Drew Halloween costume  Una storia che e partita confusa su un treno  attraverso un finestrino  ha pian piano preso colore attraverso tre punti di vista di donne apparentemente diverse  ma con in comune piu di quanto si possa immaginare  Rachel  Megan  Anna Ampio spazio narrativo viene dato alla Ragazza del treno  Rachel  che ogni giorno prende lo stesso treno per Londra e si perde attraverso i colori e le sfumature che le appaiono agli occhi sul finestrino  alla stessa poltrona  Fin quando poi il treno non rallenta al semaforo  ed eccola li la casa perfetta con Jason e Jess  coppia romantica  amorevole  che attraverso carezze e baci le ricordano il suo  di amore  Al passato  vicino  Sempre li  accanto alla casa che guarda  osserva e in cui si perde  sentendosi meglio un po  alla volta nel vedere i due personaggi fittizi felici  Perche lei felice non lo e piu  non dopo che Anna le ha rubato il suo Tom  con cui si e creata la vita che sognava  L alcool le tiene compagnia costante  allo stesso tempo le toglie ancora una volta tutto cio che ha  il lavoro  i soldi  una vita  i ricordi Perfino i suoi Jason e Jess che osserva ogni giorno non si chiamano realmente cosi  lei nemmeno sa  i loro nomi o i loro impieghi  non li conosce  Ma per lei  sono quello che immagina che siano  Finche un giorno durante la solita routine al finestrino le appare uno scenario diverso  Da li il tutto cambia Una corsa contro la verita  cosi vicina ma poi cosi lontana  Credere o non credere  Pazzia o realta  Un assassino che e stato davvero impossibile identificare Un thriller ben studiato  che sa coinvolgere il lettore  dopo l attimo di confusione iniziale  per la poca confidenza con i personaggi e la somiglianza nella narrazione seppur con i diversi personaggi  unica pecca a tratti trascurabile  Le ultime pagine sono una corsa  un po  come in treno  Lasciando finalmente vedere chiaramente al lettore i fatti  seppur attraverso un finestrino Una lettura che consiglio caldamente agli appassionati del genere       MINOR SPOILERS     Ahhhhhh  That book took my mood from slightly happy to pissed  depressed  annoyed and just dread  BUT        It was good  1  The writing was A1  Again  thumbs up for great writing skills  2  The suspense  I mean I couldn t figure out anything  One moment I swear it was Rach who d kill Megan  Like fr  fr  3  I was given a detailed look of the characters lives  How everything   fault  was because of some past experience disappointment It was a really good decent read  Plus it really did a number on me  I must say  I will definitely start looking at people much more differently  You just don t know who is who  And what one s been through My favourite quote  I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their heart   Paula Hawkins first novel kept my interest and kept me guessing  While it was billed as a thriller  I have read other thrillers that kept me holding my breath more and causing my heartbeat to rise even higher  What this book did accomplish that many primarily plot driven and plot focused thrillers do not is to develop well fleshed out characters that invoked a lot of empathy Hawkins used alcoholism  fantasy  thrill and sex addiction  physical and psychological abuse and the resulting low self esteem to add much more character depth than is often offered in the usual novel  particularly those of the thriller genre I had an idea of who was responsible fairly early on  but Hawkin s story and the options she presented  continued to keep me wondering  Blackouts caused by alcohol binging were used effectively to keep me guessing as did the fantasies and obsessions of a number of principle characters keep opening up all kinds of possibilities and cause even more uncertainties about the who s  how s and why s The Girl on the Train was well written and engaging  particularly considering this was a debut novel by Paula Hawkins  an author from London  England who was born and raised in Zimbabwe I had figured out the doer of the evil deed towards the end so I the ending wasn t totally surprising but it was quite satisfactory  I really enjoyed the combination of strong character development in a plot that offered lots of twists and turns  I think I d consider it in the psychological fiction genre rather than a thriller due to the strength of the issues brought up and the characters involved in the novel  And that s a good thing   4 stars for me which is a terrific start for a new author that I hope to read more of   Read this awhile back  Surprisingly  I still remember the plot quite well   Actual rating 3 5 starsSynopsis Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning  Every day she rattles down the track  flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes  and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck  She s even started to feel like she knows them   Jess and Jason   she calls them  Their life  as she sees it  is perfect  Not unlike the life she recently lost And then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough  Now everything s changed  Unable to keep it to herself  Rachel offers what she knows to the police  and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next  as well as in the lives of everyone involved  Has she done more harm than good My ReviewA shocking  fast paced thriller that can t be missed The girl on the train follows a young woman called Rachel  every day she takes the same train and observes the same couple  sometimes she even feels like she knows them personally  However one day she sees something shocking and everything is turned upside down This psychological thriller is different than every book I have read before  most of the time there is at least one person in a book that you like  here this is not the case  every character is absolutely terrible  no one can be trusted  In this case  it actually worked in advantage of the story  Every tiny part of the story was well plotted  as well as the character development was very well done The story worked very addictive  I wasn t able to put it down  However after I read approximately half of the book I started to expect the ending  the ending itself felt a little flat and cut short in my opinion  Which is too bad because it did disappoint me a little bit after such a great story All in all  I think the plot is great  original and very addictive  The story itself is amazingly written  the twists and turns fit exactly  Only the ending didn t fully satisfy me  which doesn t mean that I didn t like it at all  I would love to read more from this author   I couldn t put this one down  I will be on the lookout for any book written by Paula Hawkins  There are so many twists and turns that keep you reading well past bedtime   I enjoyed this book  I am drawn to dark characters so these folks were right up my ally  I think it held together well and the pace of tension building was spot on  I wasn t let down at the end at all and while it was a little over the top with personality disorders  I thoroughly enjoyed it  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fun  quick read  Ruh halimi tepetaklak ettin kitap   ___  Bunu basaracak kadar guclu bir kurgusu ve karakterleri oldugu icin verdim bu puani yoksa bilsem yanina yaklasmam  Ardindan bir kac romans devirdim zaten  Iyi geldi  A good  breezy suspense thriller kind of book   maybe a little under deserving of the hype it is getting  I didn t have the same strong reaction to the characters that some other readers did  although i think Rachel s drinking was realistically frustrating   get your shit together girl  you could have figured this out ages ago   i wanted to scream in a really uphelpful but true feeling way  I would recommend it  but not with the same level of passion i would many other books  including  Gone Girl  which this keeps getting compared to for some reason that is beyond me  I recently read an essay extolling the value of reading books featuring unlikeable characters  The writer argued that in fiction  characters shouldn t have to be likable  That essay kept popping into my mind as I read this mystery thriller because all three of the narrators are challenging flawed people that are nearly impossible to like  I was still engaged in the story  and couldn t wait to see how the story was resolved  This book has been called this year s Gone Girl  which I think is an incorrect comparison that made me expect certain things to happen that did not  The premise    watching people from the train and imagining lives for them before finding out their realities were much different    is intriguing  And even though the narrators were hard to like  I found myself wanting better things to happen  at least for two of them Read for PopSugar reading challenge task 4 Book Riot Challenge task 23  Read a book published this year This was really good  I kept hearing it was  the next Gone Girl  so I was really intrigued and went into it with pretty high expectations  I can definitely see why people are comparing it to Gone Girl as there were quite a few similarities  One of the biggest differences though  to me  was that Gone Girl was MUCH more twisted  I finished Gone Girl thinking  how in the world did the author even come up with that story     However  that was not the case with this book  It is a psychological thriller so yes  it was incredibly creepy and mysterious but the twists and the big reveal didn t impress or shock me that much  I think the story itself was great  The writing was wonderful  And the characters were written extremely well  Overall  a really good read and I would definitely recommend it to fans of psychological thrillers such as Gone Girl  So this book is very similar to gone girl in a lot of ways  Normally  that would turn me off to it because i would just feel like I was reading the same things in a different setting  But  I surprised myself by not feeling that way  I did have the moments several times upon reading it of deja vu to the Dunnes  don t get me wrong  But this story really took on a life of its own  I could envision it all so well  and the setting  felt like an awesome eerie black and white movie from the 50 s  If gaslight  gone girl and stand by me had a baby  I would name it  girl on a train     3 5 stars  Though hailed as the next Gone Girl  I can t say that I liked this book as much as Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl  Yes the double lives and psychotic antics of the main characters give you that Gone Girl appeal  I would say this novel is more reminiscent of a Alfred Hitchcock flim  I did enjoy the read  and when I wasn t distracted by life s chores it was very captivating and hard to put down  With Girl on the train there wasn t one character that I liked  I found myself loathing not only the main characters but the secondary characters as well  I am not sure if this was the intention of Paula Hawkins  if it was good job  Girl on the Train is full of plot twits and a who done it mystery with a ending that leaves the reader satisfied just not as satisfied and shocked as Gone Girl  So for that Girl on the Train comes in second to Gone Girl   Uparkhoun anthropoi pou zoun monakhoi    Auto

good time  I started slow with this book  but ultimately was glued to it and the story revealed itself in a constant swirl  I really enjoyed this book  Worthy of all the praise it is receiving   consider it a must read  I finished it in 2 days because I never wanted to put it down  This is a GREAT  who done it  novel told by 3 different narrators   an alcoholic that has missing and disjointed memories  a woman with a past that haunts her  and the woman who stole the alcoholic s husband  All 3 are dysfunctional in their own way and draw you further into the story  When one goes missing   is it foul play  If so  who is to blame  You will change your opinion multiple times throughout the book  I can t tell you more without giving it away so you ll need to read it and figure it out on your own  Just be ready for a roller coaster ride when you do   Highly riveting  Un putdown able     Non mi basta fare soltanto la moglie  Non so come facciano le altre  il tutto si riduce ad  aspettare   Aspetti che un uomo torni a casa e ti dia il suo amore  E se non ci riesci  ti guardi intorno e cerchi distrazioni     Ai genitori interessano soltanto i propri figli  sono loro il centro dell universo  l unica cosa che conti davvero  Nessun altro e importante  la gioia e il dolore degli altri non hanno senso  non esistono   Non sono solita leggere libri gialli o thriller ma la trama di questo libro mi attirava  E  stata una bella scoperta  una lettura emozionante  una galleria di personaggi apparentemente normali ma che celano tutti un altra verita  un po come nella vita reale  La storia e raccontata principalmente attraverso il punto di vista di Rachel  la protagonista piena di problemi che dice tante verita  ma anche da quello di Anna e di Megan  donne apparentemente perfette o felici  La storia si evolve ad un ritmo serrato e prende continuamente una piega diversa  i ruoli si ribaltano continuamente e il finale arriva sicuramente inaspettato http   tiserveunlibro blogspot it In my quest for a psychological thriller that could keep me as enthralled as Gone Girl  I stumbled across Girl on the Train  The book didn t fail   I really did struggle to put it down  craving the knowledge of  what happens next   I despised almost every character in the book  Not only were they unreliable narrators  they were exaggerated beyond real life  which meant that I did feel at times like I was being swamped in melodrama  My immature imagination raged every time Rachel bought another gin and tonic  my naive mind willing her to stay away from the alcohol  At the time  I thought it was awfully repetitive   this cycle of Rachel s drunken episodes   but then I realised the reality of being an alcoholic   it doesn t just disappear over night  I then appreciated this more realistic approach to a character  rather than a fairy take like  magic vanishment of all addiction  I figured out the killer too early on for my liking  I missed that last gasp  horrifying resolution of Gillian Flynn s trilogy of thrillers  Nonetheless  I cannot award the book any less than 4 stars because it really was a thriller   it gripped me from beginning to end  Despising the characters does not take away from the story  they are not supposed to be likeable  Similarly  working out who was responsible for the murder earlier on than my liking did not ruin my experience of the book   I had to keep reading  waiting for any possible last minute revelations that would reveal an alternative killer   This was a completely immersive thriller  The interplay of multiple points of view made the story bigger and richer  I dare you to not feel any emotion while reading this  The characters and their issues felt very real  and the way each one related to the story was poignant and heartbreaking Slowly  new information is leaked to the reader  making for an extremely suspenseful novel  After about the halfway mark  it was like torture having to put this book down  Fast paced and jarring  this book is sure to grip you from the very start  This one is a bit of a dark read  I enjoyed jumping between perspectives although I found it hard to keep track of the time line  The last half of the book was really captivating and I could not put it down   What happens when an alcoholic  drug addict  and psychopath collide  As you can imagine nothing good  This book is already being hailed as the next Gone Girl because it strips away the happy veneer off of seemingly domestic bliss  The thing about Gone Girl was Amy and Nick were such likable people  They both presented so well and you happily bounced back and forth through the story not knowing exactly who to believe  In this book I couldn t stand anybody  The reader is forced to view the events primarily through the muddled  alcoholic thoughts of Rachel  Rachel is truly one of the most pathetic characters I can remember reading about in a long time  She is divorced from her husband Tom and obsessed with his new family  Every day on her train ride she views a couple living in the house a few doors down from her former residence  She imagines a life for them and then one day the woman goes missing  Rachel inserts herself into the investigation and a lot of ugly truths get revealed  I could see which way the plot was going way ahead of the curve but it was a quick read and it kept my interest  Although not as twisty as it s much compared to cousin Gone Girl  this book is still a fun little thriller to kick off the New Year  Sebelum aku membaca buku ini  banyak yang mengatakan bahwa buku ini merupakan gabungan antara Before I Go To Sleep dan Gone Girl  Dan setelah membacanya sendiri  aku setuju dengan pendapat tersebut Awalnya aku bosan dengan jalan ceritanya  Beberapa halaman awal hanya menceritakan tentang kehidupan keluarga Watson dan Hipwell  dan tentu saja Rachel  Lebih banyak mengarah ke romance  Dan ketika di halaman tersebut aku masih belum menemukan dimana letak thriller nya sehingga membuat aku berpikir apakah ini novel romance   D Hingga ketika menghilangnya Megan  aku baru merasakan aura thriller  pBaca selengkapnya di http   anisaoktariani blogspot co id     This was a very good mystery read  The only thing I did not enjoy were the different PoVs  They were a nive resource for telling the story  but it didn t seem like they were diverse characters  All three girls sounded the same Apart from that  which is why a took away one star  i think it s an amazing book  The tension builds up nicely and the solution to the  thingie  was a great twist  Fun fast clever whodunnit  The Girl on the Train was described to me as a literary psychological thriller  I m not sure what that means but I do know that was a terrific read  It had a classic Hitchcock vibe  It was like Vertigo  Suspicion  and Spellbound all rolled together  I would love to see this as a film but given the Hitchcock treatment  Rachel is an alcoholic  She has lost her job  her marriage  her self esteem  She rides the train into London every day in a face saving charade of normalcy  The train slows at the same spot on her route  She sees a nice residential neighborhood where her ex husband lives with his new wife and baby  She also sees the home of another young couple  a beautiful couple  She thinks of them as the perfect couple  Perhaps she thinks of them as how she and her ex husband used to be  She watches the beautiful couple in their garden  sitting on their patio  laughing  smiling  and affectionate  Then one day Rachel sees something disturbing   or did she  With Rachel s alcoholic blackouts  she isn t sure  And now the woman in this beautiful couple is missing  Is her memory true  What does it mean  Rachel is a damaged woman who is a  stinking filthy drunk  who has absolutely no credibility with anyone  including herself  This was a fascinating read  I was aggravated and impatient with Rachel and her drunkenness  But I sympathized with her desperate need to reconstruct her memories and to determine what was true  Excellent   I think this is my new favorite I m just so  so in love with the writing  Paula Hawkins is working actually on another thriller  and I m really excited for this  after reading The Girl on the Train The book made me suspect everyone and yell  what the hell     Oh  do you see what I did there    actually for the last 150 pages  The feels I had while reading this book were soo strong Though the ending wasn t as good as the rest of the book   I suspected that person all the time  but  as I said  I suspected everyone   it s a pretty amazing book  I still can t stop thinking about it and when I got out of the bus this morning and hid the book in my bag  I was wondering about the characters  about the actions  why  when  what  And this is what I call a good thriller For a moment  just a few seconds  because of that one part that I m still not sure I understand  view spoiler   Megan had her hand and something else stained with blood  and Rachel did to   hide spoiler   I thought that Megan and Rachel were really just one person  I immediately came back to mind that this is just impossible  but you don t know what other crazy explanations I had in mind  I was looking for so many strange reasons for all the actions that now I m laughing at myself The book was fantastic  blew my mind away  One star off because of the ending   it didn t fulfill me as much as I hoped  Someone referred to this book as the new  gone girl  and I can see that is the case  it is difficult to like any of the main characters  Narrated by three different women at different time lines tells the story of a missing person  First observed by Rachel from the train she watches a couple and even gives them names  the reader figures out that it is her old neighborhood that she is observing from the train  The house she lived in with her ex husband is only a couple of doors down the street  He lives their now with his new wife and their newborn baby When Rachel observes the woman of this couple with a stranger at her house  she drinks even more and becomes obsessive  The other narrator is the  new  wife  Anna  This gives you a different look at the situations that involve Rachel who is an alcoholic  The third narrator is the missing person  Megan  She tells her story a year before she is going missing  The other two start when Megan is going missing  A fast read but not necessarily fun Told from the perspectives of the three main female characters of the book  this story is a page turner about the disappearance of one of the women and how the attempt of another to solve the mystery uncovers deadly secrets in the lives of the women and their husbands This book has been touted as the next Gone Girl  but to my mind  Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl is just a notch higher  The prose in Gone Girl is more beautiful  whereas that in The Girl on the Train is more functional and the book relies almost exclusively on the plot to engage the reader  And while Flynn manages to give her characters distinct individualities  the voices of the characters in The Girl on the Train seem to run together  The viewpoints alternate between the three female characters  but all the three women sound the same  At the beginning  before I had gotten a grasp of who is who  the frequent changes in point of view confused me  and several times I mistook one character for another  especially Anna and Rachel  The two main male characters are also portrayed very similarly   view spoiler  Both are violent  abusive and possessive  and one gets the sense that given more time  Scott would turn out to be another Tom   hide spoiler  For most of the book  the intrigue and twists made for a very satisfying read   view spoiler  I was surprised though that the truth is made quite explicit to the reader with more than a hundred pages to go  The rest of the book just plays out that denouement to its natural conclusion  I guess I d expected further twists right to the end  given the nature of the book as a thriller   hide spoiler   Anthropoi pou koubaloun problemata apo ten paidike tous elikia  anthropoi pou ekhoun mathei na kruboun ta pragmatika tous

if we want them bad enough    T S  Eliot This book was SO good  It really surprised me too  because I thought it was going to be taken in a different direction  When I read the synopsis  I thought that it was going to be like Alfred Hitchhock s Rear Window  You know  the main character see s something from outside  makes up her interpretation  and sets out to find out the truth While some of those things did happen  the plot was different  it was completely the author s  The story is mostly told from Rachel s perspective  She s a divorced woman who s become an alcoholic since then  drinking any chance she can get  Everyday  she takes a train into London and she always passes by the street she used to live on  But that s not where her attention falls  Rather  she always looks to the house that s a couple doors down from her old one  In this house  there seem to be a loving  perfect couple  Rachel nicknames them Jason and Jess and it makes her day when she can see them being affectionate Imagine her surprise when the woman she calls Jess ends up missing  Obviously the police think that the husband did it  Only Rachel doubts this  After all  she s watched them everyday  He s perfect  Jess was perfect  they were perfect  There s no way he could have killed his wife   right    Oh what a tangled web we weave When first we practice to deceive    Rachel s character was brilliantly done  You feel empathy for her  for all that she s endured  A cheating husband  who divorced her for the other woman  The inability to have a child  especially when the mistress was able to give her ex husband  Tom  one  So you understand why she s taken refuge in alcohol  Plus  she admits it  She knows she has a problem  But while all this is going on  you can t help but feel as if she s an unreliable character  Rachel has blackouts  sometimes even at key parts  and you re left wanting to know just what the hell happened at those parts  Also  you re totally rooting for her  the amateur detective trying to balance the mystery and her own messy life  which becomes harder as the plot starts to thicken and those two parts start to merge Aside from Rachel  the characters of Megan  the missing wife  and Anna  the mistress  were also very well done  You really get a sense of who all these women are  Megan  the free spirited woman trying so hard to stay in her nest with her husband Scott  Scott  who loved her with all his heart  who thought she was the perfect girl  Trying to let go of all the memories that haunt her  refusing to leave her  making her want to run  run  run away   But you can t give your heart to a wild thing  the more you do  the stronger they get  Until they re strong enough to run into the woods  Or fly into a tree  Then a taller tree  Then the sky  That s how you ll end up  Mr  Bell  If you let yourself love a wild thing  You ll end up looking at the sky    Truman Capote  Breakfast at Tiffany s Anna  who loved being the other woman   maybe even more than she loves being a wife  Who loves her child very much  but misses the days when she was carefree and gorgeous  To be honest  I didn t like Anna  Megan  while not being perfect  I still liked more than Anna  My problem with Anna was that she seemed like a b tch  Plus  I tend to be judgmental toward mistresses  especially when they feel no remorse for being the cause of a divorce  There  I said it As for the plot  it was executed perfectly  The mystery was real  it was great  and you couldn t really cross out any of the main suspects until the end  I admit  I had a hunch about the real killer  oh  probably 60  of the way in  But I only thought that because I m a fabulous detective and because  view spoiler  I always think abut who would be the most shocking person to have done it   hide spoiler  I HIGHLY recommend this book  It s amazingly real  with none of the messiness of life glossed over  And with a great mystery  Wow  I started reading this book last night and it was one of those books where you find yourself going back and reading more at every spare moment  even if it s just a page  Hawkins creates three very interesting flawed women and three very interesting troubling perspectives  At times it is painful to read this book just because of how damaged these women are and how little they truly value themselves  It s been a while since I read a book that executed a twist well  When the twist hits it s not totally unexpected because the clues have been there all along cleverly hidden  however  it s still a twist   it s not where you thought the book was leading you  My parting bit of advice is don t read this book if you are looking to have your faith in humanity restored  Kept me reading  And it was so interesting to have a character struggling with alcoholism narrating  However  I don t feel like I learned anything interesting or deep from it  it s a lighter read  I also find it not believable that Rachel eventually remembers things from when she was blacked out    If her brain was not making memories then she would not be able to just remember them later The intertwining stories of three women squirming beneath the skin of their airless lives   Please see the rest of my review at  http   www bostonglobe com arts books    Hmmm  Debating on the stars  I think it had way too many F words for 4 stars  but 3 stars doesn t seem like enough  I never really read psychological thrillers or murder mysteries because I m a wuss and I hate scary movies and I get freaked out easily  But this was  assigned  to me for book club  and I totally enjoyed it  surprising myself  All the people in this book are so messed up that I couldn t decide who the bad guy girl was the entire book  because it could have been any of them  Which made it super fun to read  The chapters jumped around chronologically and that was a bit tough when listening on audio  but I figured it out  I could totally see this as a movie too   the next Gone Girl  Fun  addicting read   Great thriller  interesting premise which at times can feel far fetched but Hawkins manages to reign it in and keep it fairly believable  Very easy and quick read  writing style was ok  Couldn t get interested at 1st  But it finally took off   I couldn t put it down   Yorumun asli ve devami Yorum Cadisi nda Trendeki Kiz tahmin edilebilirligi yuksek olmasina ragmen

Landing on the bestseller shelves in multiple bookstores  I knew I wanted to check out The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  It s been compared to Gone Girl   which I admittedly have not read   but if it s being compared to a popular thriller  I m in  I didn t read the synopsis at all  simply because the title is vague and peaks my interest already  I wanted to go into this story with no idea what the story is about   that s the best part about psychological thrillers Without spoiling anything at all  I have to say that The Girl on the Train is an addictive read  Hawkins sets the mystery up really well  with multiple components  but clear nonetheless  There are three perspectives  but I feel that the voices are distinct enough to keep straight in your head  I completely did not guess the killer at all  which is also a huge bonus  The one thing I didn t like about this story is that none of the characters are likeable  They are all incredibly flawed  and not redeemable in any case  The main character simply gets involved because she is bored and lonely  and a bit desperate for attention from her ex  This is strangely one of those stories where I was fully invested in the story without any connection to the characters I highly recommend The Girl on the Train if you re in for a thrilling ride  ahah  get it  RIDE   even if the characters are difficult to like  I got the creeps throughout the entire time I read this book  simply because Hawkins  writing style is blunt and to the point  not distracting the reader from the plot at hand Check out this review and more at Books and Other Happy Ever Afters I enjoyed this book because everyone is full of secrets  and it keeps you interested and guessing  However  I felt it was a long build up to the end where all secrets are unveiled and you learn of the murderer  although I rightly suspected from the beginning   The characters were well developed  but overall  there was a lot of unnecessary middle filler  Highly recommended  though  This one was a page turner for me  especially the last 50 pages or so  I like that it was told from the female characters  point of view  Good read  I really enjoyed this as it was told from multiple characters  perspectives and highlighted their connectedness  even though some of the characters did not know one another in real life  I also enjoy unreliable narrators  so this hit the spot  A nice mystery that kept me guessing for quite some time and then had me kicking myself for not figuring out the killer sooner   I predicted the ending but I still loved reading this book  It s everything you want from a thriller  fast paced  intriguing plot development  and train wreck characters that keep you fascinated   How did I not know this was a mystery thriller    I mean seriously   I was expecting a happy story  Then when I started to read and it wasn t happy  I figured  oh chick lit  She ll get her poop together and then we ll all be happy I d classify this as a thriller Rachel rides the train into London every day  Not to work  but to hide that she no longer has a job  When she looks out where she used to live   she focuses on a few houses before her old place  In a way to avoid looking at her old life that she just can t seem to get over  She makes up this whole story of the couple that lives there  Then one day  she sees the woman she has named Jess with another man  Rachel is furious  how could Jess do that to her wonderful husband  When Jess ends up missing  Rachel feels it is her duty to come forward with what she knows The story also follows Meagan  the missing woman and Anna the new wife of Rachel s ex husband  But I feel  after reading it all  that really Rachel is the key figure  Maybe I just like her the best   lol  Oh did I mention Rachel drinks way too much and Anna is about ready to get a restraining order on her  And yet  I still like her better   This book just whipped by keeping me on the edge of my seat until the very end  In the beginning it s not real exciting  more of laying the groundwork for the true ride at the end  Like Gone Girl  this story just grabbed me and kept me guessing until the very end   Book ReviewThe Girl on the Train by Paula HawkinsTransworld BooksRachel is having a hard time of it  Her marriage has broken down  and her husband Tom has moved on to Anna  They have started the family that Anna and Tom never could have  Rachel travels on the same train everyday to a job that she lost nine months earlier  due to her problems with Alcohol  She wants to keep the pretence of a job and a good income to her land lady  but she drinks on the train  has moments of blacking out  and is soon shown to be both unreliable and deceitful She looks into the houses she passes and fixes on the seemingly perfect lives of  Jess and Jason  However  their lives are not perfect  and when  Jess  or Megan in reality goes missing  Rachel has to make a life changing decision about what she has seen  and what she thinks she knows The Girl on the Train is Paula Hawkins debut novel  and has spent many weeks at the top of best seller lists  Her background is in Journalism means that she can write in a way that is both literary  but also deals with the small details and grubby little faults that exist within all of our lives Rachel is show to be an unreliable narrator  and the story is also told by Anna  who dislikes Rachel for the past she has with Tom  and it is also told in flashback  from the perspective of Megan  When the Police arrive their investigation is hampered by Rachel  who the police dismiss  but as the story unfolds  we realise that the murderer is a lot closer to home and that the main character are all in danger The Girl on the Train is both a thriller  but it is also a novel about humanity  about the problems that we all face  and the issues that colour our everyday lives Hawkins is a name and a talent to watch  The only book that I have really liked while simultaneously hating every character   This book was fifty shades of psycho   Extremely dysfunctional characters  can t put it down suspense  I had the feeling I was being watched a great thriller  Wow  I enjoyed this a lot more than Gone Girl  I ve seen so many similarities between the two  but this book has more depth ____________________Favorite character  RachelFirst sentence   There is a pile of clothing on the side of the train tracks  Important quote   Hollowness  that I understand  I m starting to believe that there isn t anything you can do to fix it  That s what I ve taken from the therapy sessions  the holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mold yourself through the gaps   A lo largo de toda la historia fue cambiando mi percepcion acerca de cada personaje que aparecia en la misma  excepto de Cathy  ella siempre fue igual jajaja  sin duda alguna recomiendo esta novela  que te llenara de intriga y querras seguir leyendo hasta saber el final  Sobre todo ya en las ultimas 100  Paginas  donde ya no pude detenerme  El final ha estado bien  aunque me falta aclarar un poco todo  pero en general  ha esta muy bien todo     My favourite crime writer  Karin Slaughter wrote about this book  Good thriller  but no Gone Girl  Everyone wants to be the next Gillian Flynn  but Gillian Flynn isn t finished being Gillian Flynn  I completely agree  It irritates me that every book that has an unreliable narrator  or an unexpected violent streak is touted as the next Gone Girl  Those were not the only good things about Gone Girl  Also  isn t it a bit pretentious  comparing your first novel to a really successful one  with a movie That is my rant  now about this book  It s jolly good  I liked the premise  I really enjoyed the characters   a lot of research is evident  and the prose is excellent  Highly recommended  Couldn t stop listening reading http   bevbouwer blogspot com 2015 04    This will be one of the stand out novels of 2015 I believe  I am sick of it being yet another book that is being compared to Gone Girl  Pfft to that  I think this is way better anyway  but can we stop the comparisons now  I really enjoyed every minute of The Girl on the Train The Girl on the Train just swept me away into a reading world where from the second half of the book on I did not do anything but let my eyes absorb and my imagination do it s thing  It was brilliant  I will admit it was a little bit confusing at first as I tried to piece together who was who and who was talking in the chapter but that soon subsided until I was totally enthralled and hooked  Rachel catches the same commuter train every morning  She knows it will wait at the same signal each time  overlooking a row of back gardens  She s even started to feel like she knows the people who live in one of the houses   Jess and Jason   she calls them  Their life   as she sees it   is perfect  If only Rachel could be that happy And then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough Now everything s changed  Now Rachel has a chance to become a part of the lives she s only watched from afar Now they ll see  she s much more than just the girl on the train   This book is full of psychological twists and turns  just when you think you have it all worked out it shifts gears and direction  then again  then again until you are resigned to the fact you may truly not know until the end  With an undercurrent of tension and creepy factor it s a great book  it really knows how to suck you in  The plot builds cleverly until you are desperate to know the truth and by the time you get it you are exhausted from being on edge for it  The characters are all really interesting with light and shade in all  not everybody is who they seem to be  who can you trust  What is the truth  Take my advice and try to not work it out as you will get brain fuddle A fantastic 2015 release  put this one on your list for sure this year  It s a winner  4 5 stars from me  It did not reach 5 stars only due to me being a touch confused as to what was going on in the first few chapters  but maybe I am just a bit stoooopid  Enjoy this one I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review  Many thanks  One of the senior librarians at work was raving about this title one day  how it was the next Gone Girl and the waitlist was growing exponentially  and exhorting our colleagues to get on the waitlist ASAP  Suspense was never my genre  but I put on my big girl pants  told myself that I needed to broaden my reading  and added my name  My copy came in sooner than I expected  and I have spent the last week using lunch breaks and wait times to read  Every time I would find myself out of time and wishing I had just a little bit more   and finally one snowy night I went to bed early and finished it in one sitting The story s protagonist is truly human  and I cheered for her as she struggled with her demons and tried to find answers for the huge questions the story posed  I was surprised at the revelation of the multiple layered plot s missing piece at the end  The fast pace and compelling journey made for an enjoyable reading experience I am glad I gave this title a try  Placed on wait list at Owings Mills on staff recommendation  Review originally published on my website

 the new Gone Girl   I loved Gone Girl  I couldn t wait to read it  so I bought it almost as soon as it came out  and did not regret that for one minute  I also enjoyed the movie made from it  With this one  I was very anxious to read it  I love psychological thrillers   but now that I have  I m glad I waited for the library s copy to be available to me Don t get me wrong  I liked this one a lot  But for all the talk of all the twists in it  I just didn t see that many  I liked the basic story  and the beginning was probably the most interesting part for me  when the woman on the train is imagining the lives of the people in the houses she peers into as the train passes them every day  But while I can still remember big parts of Gone Girl  and could  even before the movie came out   with this one I really think what I ll remember most is the part I just mentioned  and then the fact that the main character was so stinkin  drunk all the time that she often didn t know what was going on  Every time something happened she d swear she was going to stop drinking  while that same thing that happened drove her right to it  That got a little tiresome for me   If you liked Gone Girl  this is better  Take three unreliable narrators  a couple of nasty men and twist  First off  a pet peeve  why is it so often in British fiction that the main character tells SO MANY senseless lies  I noticed it first in Brit chick lit  but it s here too  I LOATHE this  It makes me cringe through the entire book  I mean  I get why you might not tell the truth about a lot of these things  but there s a difference between just denying or a little lying to cover up what you don t want people to know  but these are MASSIVE lies these people tell  Gah Okay  on with the review  The first part of this book bored me  Nothing much was happening except we read about this pathetic girl who s obsessed with riding the train  I was so bored  But then it picked up  I enjoyed the ride with this one despite the fact that every single characters in this book was incredibly flawed and unlikable  I also found that I kept forgetting exactly who was who  Even near the end of the book  I d look at the chapter name and have to actually sit and think about who it was we were talking about  I m not sure why that is since there really is only 6 characters in this book   yes  the roommate and the red haired guy  but I mean anyone who matters   There s no one at all to root for in this book  Maybe  if you re reading this  you can help me  So  did Megan  Yep  I totally had to pause and try and remember her name  actually have an affair with the psychologist or did she just come on to him and we only THOUGHT she did because of the way it was written  I liked the book and am curious  but I m not curious enough to go back and see if she actually named him when we read those chapters  If it wasn t him  that s a nifty bit of subterfuge there  Also  what was the deal with the ginger  That went absolutely nowhere   Super book for reading group discussion  Made me super glad I did not live in an area where commuting by train was required  It was easy to see how daily commuters could become familiar enough with homes and their occupants to the extent they felt as if they know them  But when taken to the next step of making up names for the occupants or going to those homes acting as if you do know them  that is freaky Having a friend that would allow you to move into a second bedroom  until you can get back on your feet  is truely a good friend  To take advantage of that and not work  spend money on alcohol and not help with the rent AND lie to your friend making her think you are taking the train to work every day is inexcusable  There is only so much a  friend  can take     I was fed up LONG before the eviction note was written The Girl on the Train had some serious mental issues  It was difficult to tell if she caused her problems due to self pity and low self esteem or if she truely was a few cards short of a deck  She surely made all of her problems worse by self medicating with alcohol and pills  It seems like every book club I m in picked this to read either last month  this month  or next month  It s got a huge waiting list at my library but I finally got it and it was definitely worth the wait My house back up against a gully  small canyon  and you can see and hear the people on the other side   It has great acoustics  A couple of summers back  I heard a belching contest from the other side  Gross   I have caught myself fantasizing what would happen if I heard or saw something salacious or criminal happening over there  This book brings that to mind  This debut       novel is a compulsive page turner  When I first read the blurb  I thought that Rachel actually saw a criminal act  but it s more subtle than that  It s the book Gone Girl should have been The story is told in a wonderful way from the pov of three different women  It was very effective and it kept me guessing  At times I was sympathetic towards Rachel and other times I distrusted her  This was very adept of the author  It made one of our narrators unreliable  I really enjoyed this read and hope Ms Hawkins follows it up soon   Review in Russian to follow below  Over the years  married life was represented in literature as safe harbour full of love  calmness and joy  All the fun was happening with singles  Well  not anymore  Paula Hawkins seems to pick up from the Australian Liane Moriarty on showing family as set of troubled wives  evil husbands  dead end relationships rather than as ideal couples  Guess what  Such families poise ideal setting for a murder or two Quite unusually the story is being told not by a traditional  ideal wife mother  but by a divorcee with alcohol issues  no job and very few friends left  actually just one  dreaming of perfect family life  This adds to overall perception of reality of this book  You can recognize some people in characters  and sometimes  with awe  you recognize yourself I just quickly guessed who the murderer is  that is why a 4 star Semeinaia zhizn  v populiarnoi sovremennoi literature uzhe dolgo

give it 5 stars is because I could not like any of the characters  In fact  they annoyed me  The main character  Rachel  is seriously flawed  That in itself does not make her unlikeable  but the way she dealt with what she witnessed was  in my opinion  messed up  I also did not like the way she kept her patient  long suffering roommate  Cathy  in the dark  No explanation is needed to understand why I found Anna and Megan unlikeable  As for Tom and Scott  well  I will let them speak for themselves  If you are getting the sense that there were a lot of characters in this story  you would be right  This is another reason I cannot give this book 5 stars  It keeps jumping back and forth between characters  without fully developing any one character  To add to the confusion two of these characters  Anna and Scott  are sometimes referred to as Jess and Jason  Hoping this author will provide more background information on characters in future books  She definitely has a talent for suspense  I liked this multi pov thriller a lot and the narrators did a great job imho  While I felt sad most of the time for most of the people involved I thought the author succeeded very well in conveying the mindset and struggles of trauma victims and addicts as well as the complexity of their seemingly normal relationships   Life is not a paragraph  and death is no parenthesis   Loved this line and this book was a compelling summer escape  Sure  the characters were all flawed  but who doesn t love to read about folks who are more screwed up than you are every now and again  Plenty  if you go by the 36 550 ish Goodreads reviews anyway  Even at her worst  Rachel  the alcoholic protagonist  still has some lovable and wise moments such as this   I d never realized  not until the last year or two of my life  how shaming it is to be pitied   A sober thought indeed  Sister  I thought since one of the many facets of being a bereaved parent is learning to be the object of unwanted pity  I also agreed with her thoughts about her inability to conceive   The thing about being barren is that you re not allowed to get away from it   and about her Ex   He never understood that it s possible to miss what you ve never had  to mourn for it   It was also refreshing to read a book written in the Queen s own English complete with words like  quieten  and all those extra u s and I was happy that  unlike Harry Potter  they didn t feel the need to translate it for us dumb Americans   A 1960 s new town  spreading like a tumour over the heart of Buckinghamshire   Maybe it s me  but somehow tumour seems a bit gentler than our u less version  And if I ever do get one  regardless of how it s spelled  now I know that I can buy gin and tonic in a can  Good story  but character development was a bit cumbersome at times  Still enjoyed it  despite some slow points  Great mystery   The book is kind of like a train  If you give it a little time  you ll find that it starts moving really fast  This isn t a book for everyone  It s a book with 3 female narrators  none of whom are terribly likeable  Especially Rachel  the titular center of the book  a woman who has lost her job and her husband due to her destructive alcoholic tendencies  Still  Hawkins knows how to build a riveting story and keep it moving  I know a good thriller because I ll feel like we re moving so quickly we must be near the end only to look down at my Kindle and see I m only 40  of the way through  This was definitely one of those   I started this book on Audible  facing an 8 hour drive  Within ten minutes I was completely engrossed  not so that I didn t watch the road though   Sometimes when you listen to a book rather than read it  you can get confused about the action  Not with this one  although it is quite complicated  switching voices between three different characters  at three different times  We first meet Rachel  who we quickly realize is an unemployed alcoholic  living vicariously through other people  assuming a complete life story for a couple she sees out of a train window  Then she sees something that disturbs her so much that she becomes involved in their lives  And in the lives of her ex husband and his new wife and child As the words tumble from her  and from Megan  the young woman that Rachel has seen from a train and finally from Anna  Rachel s ex husband s new wife  we see that the first assumptions we made about Rachel  that she is crazy  lives in an alcohol indused fog   may have been wrong  Or at least the situation is far more complicated than we first thought  Rather like we ourselves are people in a train  gazing at Rachel s puffy face  crazy mutterings  so embarrassed that we turn to look out of the train and see a couple in a yard living an idyllic life and think  That s what happiness is   Maybe  Maybe not  I read the last two hours of the book on my Kindle  straight through  I couldn t let go of Rachel s  Meg s and Anna s story  Although when you use a long lens after reading the book  the plot was simple  Hawkins has managed to put so many nuances into it that never once did I say  as I sometimes do with mystery thrillers   Oh that was a cheat   This is no cheat  This is a great book  I enjoyed this a lot  Quite a beach read  and better than Gone Girl  for me  because Rachel is SUCH an unreliable narrator that there s no way of knowing what s what  I figured out  who did it  somewhat earlier than I d like to have  but it didn t stop it from being a good  well written yearn  The most depressing book I can remember reading  Still a good story  Uitgelezen op nog geen 24 uur tijd  Aanrader  I didn t think I was going to like this book after reading the first few chapters  mostly due to the main character s repeated behavior  It was getting old  Then  the other characters started to develop and the plot started to thicken  I definitely didn t see then ending happening the way it did  but it was great  I enjoyed the suspense and thrill of the story   La chica del tren es un interesante y adictivo thriller de accion que busca algo mas que proporcionar al lector un mero entretenimiento  Hawkins nos abre las puertas de la mente de una protagonista que  superada por su propia vida  se ve involucrada en turbios asuntos de secretos  mentiras y muerte  A pesar de que el resto del elenco no esta a la altura del personaje principal  se trata de una novela que vale la pena leer gracias a su bien construida trama donde no faltan las escenas de misterio  Lee nuestra resena completa aqui  Much in the vain of Gone Girl  this book deals with the intricacies of relationships and the lies that bind us  I really enjoyed this book  the plot and pace were gripping and the author even managed to place some empathy with highly unlikeable characters  It is the plot that makes the book so strong in its delivery  it s intrigue as the tangled lives of the three main characters  surrounding the tragic death of a young woman  become clearer A great novel and well worth a read if you re a crime suspense fan   Pfffiou    I feel like I ve been holding my breath for 325 pages and only now finally exhaled  Picked it up after reading some rave reviews that compared it to Gone Girl  some calling it better than that and others calling it the book of the year so far  I quite enjoyed reading it and it s one of those books you want to keep turning the pages of  telling yourself   ok one more chapter before I sleep  What I liked about the book were two things   first  that every chapter was a narrative from a character s perspective mapped to dates and times that sometimes had to be cross referenced to understand the sequence of events  and second  the very indirect way of tying disjointed lives together with a single event and weaving in the psychology of each person  Also really liked the way the author depicts the helplessness of an out of control alcoholic and the vicious circle of weakness she is stuck in What I missed was that  oh my god no    moment      which isn t necessarily a negative  since everything unfurls slowly and is constantly in a state of un clarity until it finally comes to the fore  All in all  one of the  must reads  this year  especially all afternoon  tucked in bed on a stormy day like I did     This was a great thriller  It reminded me a bit of  Before I Go to Sleep  in that you re trying to figure out what happened right along with the characters  I definitely recommend this one   Rachel is a strange kind of narrator  She s not entirely reliable  likable enough  but at the same time   pathetic  Her marriage disintegrated and she let herself loose  falling as low as a woman possibly can  Tom  the husband  married the mistress  they had a child together and still  Rachel was stubbornly drawn to man that wasn t hers for years  She became an alcoholic  her behavior was erratic and borderline insane  Every day she rides the train to work she no loner has and daydreams about imaginary lives of families living along the train tracks  Rachel is the girl on the train  finding a form of comfort in the lives of strangers safe at home  Her overactive imagination leads her into a murder web  An interesting note about the other characters   they all are guilty of something   liars  adulterers  emotional abusers  obsessed    They are human  but they also are flawed  very much so   Ultimately  The Girl on the Train is a first class debut thriller  well written  entertaining and keeping you guessing whodunit till the very last chapters I would definitely be looking forward to the adaptation  Overall the book was good  but the characters were under developed  it was quite slow to start  I barely read the first 1 4 of the book in 2 days  but after that  it became very addicting and I couldn t let it down Even though the ending caught me off guard  I still was expecting a bigger plot twist  And the ending was really abrupt  I was expecting probably something else  something more elaborate  thrilling  perhaps another plot twist If I d analyze the book and see everything I didn t like  the review would probably be 3 stars  but since I enjoyed reading it  I ll try to see the positive part and give it 4   El ano pasado fue Gone Girl  pero este ano este libro me ha conquistado  Una historia de esas que te hacen pensar y darle mil vueltas a la trama  Este tipo de novelas son las que enganchan hasta el final  Muy recomendable  I really enjoyed this psychological thriller  Many unexpected twists and turns made this murder mystery right up my alley  4 5  but dammit I wish I could give it 5  StarsI ve heard so much from friends regarding this book  both good and bad  that I felt compelled to read it and see what all the commotion was about  First off  this book is engaging  The first few pages started off slow but when it picked up pace  I found myself consuming each word to the point that I became frustrated when I had to put the book down to  you know  live my life  A part of what made this so engaging and entertaining is that the author takes unreliable narration to another level with the main character Rachel  Rachel  who is dealing with alcohol addiction  and a host of other issues   spends most of the book either drinking or intoxicated or struggling to recover from one of her many blackouts that you never can be sure if what she s seeing  saying  or remembering is real and thusly if what you re reading ever happened or the puzzle pieces you re holding even exist   Admittedly I initially questioned if Megan had even disappeared  view spoiler  but quickly let go of that denial when I noticed the chapters from Megan s POV were set in the past  hide spoiler     In addition to her alcohol addiction  there are times when Rachel spends the book holding on to child like fantasies about the other characters and the world around her or just flat out lying that teasing out what parts are reality and truthful  respectively  become challenging  With these qualities for the main person narrating  there was never a dull moment  I found myself experiencing so many different emotions when it came to Rachel  Overall  I was sympathetic towards her character because it was clear that she d experienced trauma that was unbearable for her and influenced her need to exist within a fantasy  On the other hand  there were many times when I got frustrated and angry with her  Rachel appeared intent on unraveling this mystery of Megan s disappearance and I felt as if I was sitting in the train seat right next to her  seeing the mystery through her eyes and rooting for her to figure it out  Each time she looked as if she had another crucial puzzle piece put together  or maybe not  but it seemed like it  and would then take a drink  I about lost it  It was like  Rachel  can you seriously not stay sober for just two fucking more minutes so you can figure this damn thing out    As much as this pissed me off  I have to say  it generated so much suspense as you realize there is something so sinister in those memories hidden within the haze of her blackouts and by not uncovering those memories it keeps that threat of  who did what  and  who can you trust  looming throughout the story   Much respect to the author on the precision given to the editing of this book  Secondly  this book is told solely from the perspective of women and the author does an interesting job of spotlighting and then pulling apart certain gender stereotypes  There s Rachel who is repeatedly dismissed throughout the book and labeled as crazy  a drunk  and  a rubbernecker  when she displays anger  panic  fear or confusion regarding what is occurring around her  At first glance  you could point to her alcohol abuse as the factor but it goes beyond that  In a scene with the detectives  she is questioned regarding how she reacted to her husband cheating on her and starting a family with the woman he cheated with and when she was deemed as having not dealt with that betrayal in an  acceptable  manner  she was labeled by the detectives as erratic and unstable  meaning  too emotional   and then ultimately dismissed  As a reader  I noticed times where I questioned her credibility and then had to stop to question why I was doing this  especially considering I was experiencing similar feelings of fear and anxiety in response to the perceived threat during certain scenes  Then there is Megan who through the eyes of Rachel  and others  appears to personify the  perfect  woman  pretty  dutiful wife  and cares for the household  Yet on closer inspection she s suffocating within the confines of her marriage and battling her own trauma history  which brings complexity to her character   view spoiler   The moment when it s revealed in the news that she does not fit the perfect  nurturer caregiver  role  she s dismissed as deserving of whatever has happened to her   hide spoiler   And lastly there s Anna who engaged in a sexual relationship with Tom while he was married to Rachel  Anna comes across as entitled  smug  self important  and self centered  which is a far cry from the warm and submissive gender expectations for women  I noticed in reviews that Anna seems to get the most vitriol  labeled in sexist means as a  homewrecker  or demonized for her attitude towards Rachel and her relationship with Tom  which is fascinating since I found her to have a mindset similar to most  alpha male  characters I come across in romance fiction  Anna is equally compelling as Rachel and Megan  albeit not quite as fleshed out character wise  in that Anna plays into some stereotypes of women as flirts and needing to be desired to get what she wants but then acts and thinks in ways that are so outside of our assumptions for the way women should behave that leaves her unpredictable  Lastly  the book has enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing   view spoiler  I thought at one point that maybe Megan and Anna didn t exist  then I questioned if they were different personalities within Rachel  then I trusted that they were three separate people but maybe Rachel was responsible for Megan s disappearance   but then I thought it was Anna    hide spoiler   My only issue was this book was anti climatic and a bit of a letdown when the final mystery is revealed  Typically  I d downgrade like crazy because of that but due to how engaging the rest of the story is  I m willing to overlook it   slightly  Gostei muito  Ja tinha ouvido falar muito deste livro e finalmente li o    Achei particularmente interessante a forma como esta escrito  nao como uma narrativa convencional  mas sim como uma sucessao de textos escritos na primeira pessoa  como se fossem entradas de um diario  ou blog  das principais personagens  permitindo um ponto de vista unico e muito pessoal sobre o desenrolar da historia    O ponto de partida e extremamente simples e eficaz  uma rapariga a atravessar um mau momento da sua vida  nas suas deslocacoes diarias de comboio entre os suburbios o centro de Londres observa o que a rodeia a partir da janela da carruagem  particularmente quando este para num semaforo que fica mesmo em frente as traseiras de uma casa num bairro onde ela ja morou e onde um jovem casal parece muito feliz a tomar o seu cafe matjnal    os problemas comecam quando ela se decide envolver na vida das pessoas que observa  A autora desenvolve um trabalho notavel na construcao dos varios personagens e na sua desconstrucao    sim  pq nem tudo e tao simples e linear como parece e os acontecimentos vao rasteirando o leitor  fazendo o mudar de opiniao sobre cada um dos intervenientes ao longo da historia  Apesar da reviravolta final nao me ter surpreendido muito  ja vi muito filme e ja li muito livro policial e consegui prever muita coisa  o livro prendeu me e manteve me acordado este sabado ate o acabar  Uma estreia muito promissora desta autora  fico curioso quanto ao seu proximo trabalho  Excellent thriller  Rachel gets involved with two families whom she watched while riding into London daily  All characters are richly developed  The plot just got better and better  The twists are unexpected  Didn t see the ending coming   I read my first  and only  thriller back in 2012  It came in the form of The Poison Tree by Erin Kelly and although it still remains one of my favourite stories  I had already watched the ITV adaptation prior to reading the book  so it wasn t as  thrilling  as a thriller should be  3 years later  I have read my second thriller and although it will never be my favourite genre  I thoroughly enjoyed the exciting  suspenseful plot of The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  As this book is still making it s rounds through endless cafes  beaches  living rooms  busses and trains around the world  I don t want to give anything away that may spoil the unexpected ending  The important thing about reading a book is that you can put yourself in the position of the characters  That you can put yourself in this persons shoes and think  Yeah  I can see why you re doing this    I can understand why you re acting this way   and I definitely felt this way towards Rachel  Her actions may have been drastic and most of the time I was worried sick about her  but it wasn t difficult for me to put myself in her position and I quickly came to the realisation that I could easily become a Rachel myself under those circumstances It s also important for an author to write characters that you trust and Paula has expertly written Anna  Megan  Tom and Scott  Again  I don t want to give anything away but Paula has managed to write the perfect mix of characters that you wouldn t trust one bit only to realise that they were innocent people alongside characters that you would trust with your life only to realise that they would stab you right in the back  I trusted certain characters so much that I felt like I knew them  just as Rachel felt about  Jess and Jason   and I felt cheated to find out I had trusted the wrong people all along  The Girl on the Train itself is a thrill ride but I did find that the suspense of what was going to happen in the end was more exciting than the conclusion itself  Although  the suspense itself is enough to read this book whether you were satisfied with the ending or not  But all I can say is  if you re a fan of this genre and think you ve solved hundreds of fictional murders before  don t try and solve Megan s murder because you just won t see it coming  Ik heb getwijfeld tussen vijf en vier sterren  Vijf omdat het boek enorm vlot leest  Het opzet en de vertelstijl grijpen je onmiddellijk bij je kraag  Vier omdat het einde niet de ommezwaai had die ik hoopte  Maar zoek je naar een spannende en vlotte pageturner  die echt wel even blijft hangen  Dan is dit je boek   From the beginning this story touched my heart as I was able to relate to the beginning of the story    it wasn t until towards the end that this story truly shifted    I felt so bad for Rachel all throughout her ordeal and at the same time anna surprised me at how she defended Rachel even though anna hated her   It was a very sad ending for Meghan but life has a way of cashing in before you move on   over all it was well written and relayed    Erg spannend boek  Goed opgebouwd en gelijk meeslepend  Het middenstuk was iets te langdradig naar mijn mening en hier en daar kwam ik in de war met de namen  Maar dat is gewoon iets van mij denk ik  Zeker vier sterren waard  al denk ik niet dat het een boek is dat me eeuwig bij zal blijven  It s no surprise that this book keeps being referred to as  this year s  Gone Girl   A whole cast of despicable characters  Check  Shifting narrators and timelines  Check  Murder  mystery  mayhem  Check  check  check  And while The Girl on the Train was a thrilling page turner  I ultimately found the hype and GG comparisons to work to its detriment  The middle of the story was a little underbaked and repetitive  when all I really wanted to do was get to the exciting  pulpy conclusion  I still definitely recommend this book  but would perhaps suggest leaving the Gillian Flynn comparisons at the door  Couldn t put it down   I hated all 3 of the narrators  Rachel  the girl on the train  is an alcoholic and lives a pathetic existence  Megan is a slut  then you ve got the husband stealing Anna    I hated them all but I still loved the book  It s a quick read  interesting and while I don t have much experience with this genre I know this was a great enjoyable read   Couldn t put this book down  Thriller from start to finish as the characters develop  4 5 stars This book was disturbing in so many ways  Really  really good  awesome actually but it shook me a little  The first 30 40 pages depressed me so much  I wanted to give up the reading  Everything was so hopeless  grey  sad   it really ruined my happy mood  It drained all my positivism  But after that  I couldn t stay away  This book is dark  The characters are dark  very intense and troubled  Everyone here would probably go to Hell if such a thing existed in this book  I reacted very strongly to every character in this book  These people terrified me and fascinated me at once  Rachel disgusted me sometimes although she makes a very interesting and also very improbable detective  She challenged my feelings for her every step of the way The mystery is interesting  not the best I ve read  but it keeps you going and it keeps you interested in the development of the story  I found out who the killer was more or less in the middle of the book but there are a few convincing red herrings throughout  Anyway  what really got me in this reading was the human factor   everybody is so disturbed  This book is really interesting to analyse in a psychological perspective   The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a fast paced murder mystery with lots of twists and turns throughout  It is July 2013 and Rachel  a middle aged single woman  commutes by train to London every day  She has memorized everything about the trip  from the stops to the landscape  and has become particularly fascinated by a happy couple she sees almost everyday  But then one day she sees something new and she cannot let it go  And then the rug is pulled out from underneath her when her dreamy couple becomes one of London s most intriguing headlines The similarities between this novel to Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl are uncanny  This story is told from multiple perspectives  people s  truths  are never really as they seem  and there is even a male female police duo  This story is also told in alternating viewpoints and flashes backward and forward in time  Readers will follow Rachel and two other female characters as the search for answers in all of their lives unfolds  This book was easy to read and intriguing but the ending left me with a little longing for something more  I enjoyed the development of the lead character  Rachel  but honestly felt this was too similar to Gone Girl  Readers who enjoy murder mysteries  thrillers  and dysfunctional female characters will enjoy this book  Tak diky docela zvlastnimu zacatku to na plny pocet bodu neni  Musim priznat  ze chvilemi mne stvala Rachel  nemam rada az tak  bezradne  zeny  ktere se vrhaji do sebezkazy   Ale jinak pribeh byl skvely  od ste stranky jsem se opravdu bavila a knihu nechtela dat z ruky  Vice napisu v recenzi na blogu  ale to az casem     ted nad tim musim jeste popremyslet    If you like thrillers  this one s a fast and fun read  I was hooked from ride one  It would be great to see as an Alfred Hitchcock movie  As always  I get tired of seeing the F bomb tossed around FYI  Lots of reviews are comparing this to Gone Girl  which I have to say that I bought and put down because of the nastiness  Yuck  My husband and I then bought it on audio to listen to on a drive    you d think I would ve learned the first time  but hearing it out loud was even worse than reading it  Nasty  Nasty  Nasty  Didn t even try for a 3rd time with the movie   I started listening to the audio of this two days ago during my commute  Yesterday  I swung by the library on my way home to snag the book because I didn t really plan on leaving my house too much over the weekend  but couldn t wait until Monday to continue listening  I finished it this afternoon  and really enjoyed it  I felt sorry for Rachel  and am always intrigued by unreliable narrators  I hated Anna and Tom  her ex husband and the woman he left her for   and was curious to find out what had happened to Jess Megan  I had my theories  but was still managed to be surprised by the ending  Full blog review to come   Vanochtend vroeg heb ik deze spannende psychologische thriller uitgelezen  De karakters zijn allemaal zo prachtig uitgewerkt  Ik moet bekennen met iedereen is wel wat mis  Maar dat zorgde ervoor dat ik niet kon stoppen met lezen  Een eind wat ik zeker het overgrote deel van het boek niet heb zien aankomen  Absoluut een aanrader  i

like Gone girl  the story moves fast and is compelling  Rachel  the main character of the book  becomes obsessed with a couple she observes on her daily train ride  Divorced for two years  she s never gotten over this loss  so she creates a fantasy world around the couple whom she calls  Jason and Jess   transferring the perfect married life she delusionally thinks she had onto them 13460996As fate would have it  Jess and Jason  whose names are really Megan and Scott  live a few doors down from the house Rachel once shared with her husband Tom  An alcoholic  Rachel also obsesses about Tom and his new Anna and their baby girl  During drunken stupors  she inserts herself into their lives on a regular basis and her compulsions set off a chain of tragic events Paula Hawkins has written a gripping novel about memories  imagination  fantasy  truth and lies  Told in the alternating voices of Rachel  Megan and Anna  the story is revealed layer by layer as each character speaks what is her own truth Like a Hitchcock thriller  The girl on the train grabs you from the first page  It has a believable surprise ending that won t disappoint  It s a fast  exciting read that you won t want to put it down until you re finished  Recommended Review by Helen The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  My mother used to tell me that I had an overactive imagination  Tom said that too  I can t help it  I catch sight of these discarded scraps  a dirty T shirt or a lonesome shoe  and all I can think of is the other shoe  and the feet that fitted into them    On the outside  Rachel is a perfectly normal woman  but her life is profoundly messy   tangled in the muddle of her ex husband who married off to another woman and stressing over the daily struggles of her insecurities  Everyday  Rachel takes the commuter train and scrutinizes her favorite track sick house  number fifteen for  in this house  dwells  the perfect  golden couple   Page 14   As time passes  she repeatedly sees the couple  or as she refers to as  Jess and Jason   and becomes obsessive towards their relationship  She knows every intricate detail of the house  but more about the people inside it  She thought they were the perfect pair  or at least she did  until one day Jess  whose real name is Megan  goes missing  When Megan goes missing  Rachel couldn t have been more a wreck  Rachel underwent a memory lapse due to the addiction of alcohol on the night that Megan went missing  In the beginning  Rachel convinces herself that her blackout is not tied to the disappearing of Megan  she believes that she is innocent  But is she  How can she be certainly sure of something that she has no memory of  The thriller is astoundingly developed  with numerous red herrings  twists  and turns   Seeing that as the novel is written in first person point of view  the readers have a reliable sense of what the characters are feeling which allows the readers to get lost and be part of the story itself  Refining the format of the novel  Paula Hawkins switches between the three characters  points of view  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  the current wife of Rachel s ex husband  This enables the readers to distinguish the contrasting lives of these three women and how one sees the other as because they re all acquaintances of one another  Paul Hawkins slowly intensifies the disappearance of Megan at a great pace as the story goes on  She turns Rachel  the obsessive stalker  to become seemingly involved in the case and gradually puts the pieces together  The way Rachel was described was fascinating  From the pathetic woman who lost her husband to another woman  she ends up showing persistence  and courage   This was a compulsively readable novel about a woman who watches a married couple through the windows of her commuter train every day  She imagines their lives  as a way of taking her mind off her troubles  she has endured a painful divorce  lost her job and is drinking heavily  But her  Rear Window  obsession becomes real when the wife of the couple she fantasizes about is murdered  I wonder if I would have given this five stars if I hadn t been told by reviewers  JUST LIKE GILLIAN FLYNN   Really NOT just like  Much more straightforward Voyeurism  alcoholism  jealousy  guilt  And three women s perspectives  I went into this book with a lot of cynicism  I guess   because I d read that it is comparable to Gone Girl and I actually never finished that book  I got to about 85  of the way through it and just    didn t finish it   However  I don t really have any particular reason I didn t finish Gone Girl    I didn t like the characters but you re not supposed to like them Anyway  Back to The Girl on the Train  I m going to give you a one word spoiler  view spoiler  GASLIGHTING   hide spoiler  Or at least  that was the main thought in my head  about 75  through the book I can t really express why this book was so enjoyable to me  I think that for me  I liked Rachel a little more than I liked any of the characters in Gone Girl  and having that tiny bit of sympathy for her made reading the book easier  although there were still some cringeworthy parts in terms of her actions  It really is interesting  though  because it really does totally change your perception of people  I did guess the  whodunit  about 65 or 70  through it  but for me  it didn t ruin the story The ending was pretty amazing in a creepy as shit way The one thing I didn t really like was that at the beginning I got confused about who each of the 3 women were  Rachel  Anna  and Megan  although Anna didn t come into the story  in terms of having her own chapters  til later   But once that straightened itself out  the book sped along  I finished it in only a couple of days once I got started  and if I had had the time  it would ve been finished in a few hours  As a thriller mystery  this book is fantastic  The way Hawkins weaves the three women s different stories  perspectives  and timelines together to steadily march the reader through the plot is almost mind boggling in its complexities  I couldn t put the stinking thing down  It wasn t the most comfortable read for my tastes  I was a bit stressed  but I think that s just the nature of the genre  right  I enjoyed how Hawkins linked all the women to bearing life  to babies  That was a good thread  The train as a frame was a bit clunky and obvious  unless I m missing some deeper meaning there  I suppose it did serve to show you how the women were different from each other   I really enjoyed this book more than Gone Girl  which it is constantly compared to  I hate the way Gone girl ends  This ending was better  I somehow did not see the twist coming at the end  The main character narrator is constantly becoming hammered and ruining her life with embarrassing situations or lies  It s often uncomfortable and depressing  but you also find yourself relating to her  thinking of your most embarrassing nights out  and wanting her to have a victory  wanting her to solve this crime  no matter how Unhealthy her obsession is  When the crime is solved  you are still Unsatisfied at what a mess was made to everyone s life  but fulfilled by a good mystery solved  and resolution  so you def get mixed feelings  a good drunk buzz and a hangover  Crime mystery lovers will enjoy this novel  People that have never been black out drunk before might not  Can t wait to see the film   y asi sin mas llego    lo comence a leer  segui leyendo  continue y no se en que momento me percate que ya estaba por el final  Si bien no me sorprendio del todo  si fue mi cara de odio hacia Anna en un principio y mi cara de pobre chica a Rachel  Aun sigo sin comprender un poco la conducta de Anna  creo que la historia esta bien fundamentada y que mas que el hecho simple de una muerte  no es eso lo que te agarra al libro y te sostiene leyendolo  no  creo que es el hecho de como carajos no recuerdas       creo que a todos nos ha pasado  es verdad  un suceso en la vida que tiene lagunas  esas lagunas son las que te aferran a el  te hacen devorarlo  estrujarlo y al final decir  BAM  AHI ESTA   Muy buena estructura del libro a mi humilde punto de vista  recomendable para leer  pasar una tarde linda diciendote a ti misma no es capaz y terminando por decir ahora entiendo por que es un numero uno del New York Times Yo hubiera hecho lo mismo  aun no se si lo haria por defensa o por enojo   y tu  Because I start this review way off track  pun intended   I want to first say  The Girl on the Train is great  If you liked Gone Girl  read it  If you didn t like Gone Girl  read it  If you never read Gone Girl    well  you probably don t care about this subgenre of suspense novel  and this book won t change your mind  Now for a temporarily derailment  not sorry  before getting this train of thought going full speed ahead   Still not sorry  The Girl on the Train is part of a disturbing trend in fiction  No  not the trend of terrible people doing terrible things while we re compelled to read their terrible actions  and  somewhat terribly  root for them  Yes  The Girl on the Train is exactly one of those books  but the trend I mean is the one in which these terrible women aren t women  They re  girls   Think Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  Gone Girl  Lena Dunham s Not That Kind of Girl   j k  Lena  I love you  I blame Stieg Larsson for popularizing this type of title  Or maybe it was Anne Frank  Anyway  it must be said  the fault of Larsson s title lies with his American translator  The American translator came up with the offensive English title that has been oft copied  I found the sequel to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo insanely problematic  but the initial book had its strengths  namely the character of Lisbeth Salander  The title demeans her  even before Larsson does in future books  by calling her a  girl   Since then  it seems like dozens of fictional women have been girled  It s disturbing  and not necessarily what the authors may have in mind  However  this review isn t about Stieg Larsson  Shame on me  taking a book about a  girl  and making it into a story about a man  The Girl on the Train makes you think it s going to do that too  but it doesn t  As I first read the book  I thought the title might be the result of the publisher  not necessarily author Paula Hawkins  fault  But then she has her main character  Rachel  refer to herself as  the girl on the train   Ugh  I thought  But then I realized that Rachel doesn t want to just be  the girl  on the train  She wants to matter  She s not sure how to do it  who among us is    but she wants to make a difference somehow  to redeem herself and reclaim her agency  agency that a  girl  doesn t have  Hawkins doesn t use the same girl vs  woman language I used in my intro  but Rachel doesn t want to be a  girl  anymore  and the book explores what it means to be girled by    surprise surprise    emotionally abusive men   Vague spoilery stuff ahead in my plot synopsis analysis  synoplysis   but I never explicitly reveal who does what  Rachel is our main character  She is also a drunk   I d be a drunk too if we had GIN AND TONIC IN A CAN in the U S   Rachel is a terrible  violent  black out drunk  She is what you might call an  unreliable narrator   But you would be wrong  Rachel is actually flat out honest with everyone  The problem is that her memories  because of her blackouts  are unreliable  It s a fine distinction  Many books mislead their readers with the lazy conceit of having a liar for a narrator  I m looking at you  Gone Girl    Rachel desperately wants to be honest  but she doesn t know how  Yes  unreliable memory is a conceit too  but the book actually addresses this  and the complex cause and effect of Rachel s alcoholism  directly  making it one of its themes  Like Rachel  Hawkins does it in a frank and honest way  When many of the  girls  in recent memory are manipulative liars  it s refreshing to see a woman struggling to be the opposite  Our other two narrators are Megan and Anna  I won t say too much about them  or their respective husband characters  Identities of all characters twist and swirl in a fascinating  organic way  We all make up stories about people  and what we make up is almost always wrong  Although Rachel is the most explicit one    imagining a life of two complete strangers she sees from her train every day    all the characters do it  They make assumptions  and more often than not they are way off base  Only when you stop speeding by  as if on a train  do you get to know someone    and you might regret that you did As for technical stuff  the pacing is good  The symbolism is good and consistent  so many books I ve recently read bring up an image or symbol only to drop it   but complicated enough to not grow stale  We flip between the three narrators  with Rachel being almost ever odd numbered chapter  The chapters get shorter and shorter as the book ramps up the pace toward the conclusion  Just when you re getting tired of all the sulking and confusion  the dominoes start to fall faster and faster  The three narrators are each interesting in their own way  and each one evokes different feelings  There is one brief segment at the end which is forced  in order to forward the plot  Two characters argue for two solid pages while a third watches  Then  the third is like   okay  distract so and so and I ll call the police   when s he should have just called the police while they were arguing  But I forgive this because I like the writing style  Hawkins has a way of repeating herself that isn t repetition  it s parallelism  Her three narrators often have very similar thoughts  but from a slightly different angle  This isn t a first time author mistake  making all of her characters sound the same  They sound the same  and think similar ways  because they are all very similar people  It makes sense    because they are all being taken advantage of by the same man  a man who preys on this specific type of person  Only by seeing how similar they are  not how different they are  do we see the puzzle pieces fit together The title  concept  and timing invite comparisons to Gone Girl  so  dammit  I m going to compare it to Gone Girl  a book I thoroughly enjoyed  Train is mercifully shorter than Gone Girl  Train needs to be shorter because it doesn t have the same spark and wit and fun that Gone Girl does  But where Gillian Flynn spends most of her pages trying to trick her readers  Paula Hawkins is trying to trick her characters  thereby tricking us in the process  although early on she does get a little tricky with pronouns to build suspense in an annoying way   It s a subtle difference  but one that makes The Girl on the Train ultimately stronger than Gone Girl  Gone Girl may have the sizzle  but The Girl on the Train has more steak  Edit  I got a little over zealous with this one  I blame allergies   so I m bringing it down to four stars  Still a good book  but only if you barrel through it to the end  which is an enjoyable fun ride  But going back through it  I don t find it as compelling   Un libro con el que todos nos podemos sentir un poco identificados  a todos nos gusta en mayor o menor medida cotillear la vida de los demas A nuestra protagonista demasiado     sus buenas intenciones la meteran en mas de un lio del que saldra escaldada Un buen final  consigue que todos conjeturemos el posible desenlace  Woww   Unpredictable    Ga nyangka dengan endingnya   Baru  ngeh  ketika mendekati ending   Deritakan dengan 3 sudut pandang yang berbeda  Rachel  Megan dan Anna   dan 3 orang ini adalah orang yang paling dekat dengan pelakunya   Rekomen    Ga sabar tunggu filmnya   Esta foi  sem a menor duvida  uma leitura compulsiva  Consigo compreender o porque de este thriller se ter tornado um fenomeno mundial  e rapido  viciante e surpreendente  Relativamente as personagens  sao um  bando de gente doida   mas isso ate contribui para tornar o livro mais perturbador  A historia e contada a partir da visao de tres personagens  que nos vao dando perspectivas distintas das mesmas situacoes  A partir de determinada altura comeca se a deslindar o que vai suceder  mas nao deixa de ser cativante a quantidade de voltas que o enredo da ate ao final  E um livro simples  que se le num apice e que me manteve em pulgas pagina atras de pagina  sempre com vontade de saber mais e ver ate onde toda aquela loucura ia dar  O tom psicotico do livro fez me lembrar ligeiramente a obra  Gone Girl  de Gillian Flynn  com a diferenca que nao fiquei com um sentimento de amor odio no final do livro de Paula Hawkins  Pontuacao  4 5 5 This was an uniquely done murder suspense story  What was different in this was that all three of the narrators are really unlikable people  Rachael is the primary narrator and she s a blackout alcoholic who lives in her own world making up stories as she goes along  She lies constantly and you re not always sure what the truth is in her part of the narration  The other two women have lesser narration time but they are not any better  They re selfish and unkind and one is an adultress  I know some people did not like this book because of the MC s but that s exactly why I liked it  It strayed from the traditional narrator being the  good guy   I thought it was creatively done and I enjoyed everything about the story   I listened to this on audio and it was really well done but it takes a bit of getting used to as there are three different women telling the story   When was the last time I d read a novel in two days  Fast paced  twists  red herrings  Not Gone Girl but with a lot of its devices  the casual releasing of information that jolts the reader  Someone lent this to me  I doubted I d find it interesting  Wrong  But there are some messed up characters in this one  neurotic is a milder term I would use  I m normally not a suspense reader or a reader of books that are overly hyped up  I haven t read Gone Girl which I ve often seen it compared to  Now     with that said  I couldn t wait to get to the end  I actually set the book down and paced around my living room a few times trying to wrap my head around some things  Poor  poor Rachel  My heart hurt for her  To be so broken  so sad and for everyone to think you re crazy   semi spoiler  Anna was a BITCH  Even until the end  She seemed like a psychopath too  just ugh  I guessed it before I was half way through the book  At first I had a few theories but then I a few things kept pointing to  it   I don t like feeling scared when I read and this book allowed me to be pulled to the edge of my seat and intrigued  Do I think this is a literary work of art  Nah  but the ability to switch character POV that often and not leave the reader confused is worth 3 stars alone in my book  The believability in the characters added another star for me for a 4 star review  This one kept me guessing  Great twists  unreliable narrators  and things that aren t what they appear to be  Switching between the characters needed some attention so as not to wander down the wrong path  Great read  Britanska pisateljica je do leta 2015  ko ji je uspel veliki met z Dekletom na vlaku  pisala romance pod psevdonimom Amy Silver  vendar brez vidnega

kar je zena sprejemala z odprtimi rokami  Rachel je s svojimi mislimi vstopila v njun osebni prostor in jima izrisovala pot  po kateri sta stopala  Pot brez ovir  zavojev  klancev  Imela sta vse  kar je bilo njej vzeto  Bila sta njena sreca Vsaj tako je bila trdno prepricana  dokler nekega dne ni opazila necesa  kar jo je vrglo iz tira  Milni mehurcek se je v hipu razblinil  tako hitro ji je spodneslo tla  da se je lahko oklenila edinega prijatelja  ki ga je se imela   alkohol  V casopisu je prebrala  da je Megan   zenska iz hise  ki jo je tako rada opazovala   izginila  Ker se je v pijanskem deliriju na vecer njenega izginotja motala prav v tem okolisu  saj je tu zivel tudi njen bivsi moz  je z grozo  ki jo je podzgalo se skelece zavedanje  da se ne spominja prav nicesar  kar se je dogajalo tistega vecera  pomislila  da je povezana z izginotjem  Kaj se je pravzaprav zgodilo  In kaj  za vraga  je storila Ze na uvodnih straneh je zgodba zakolicena s stevilnimi vprasanji in zapleti  ki se z ravno prav odmerjenim tempom odmotajo do zadnje strani  Dogodek  ki sprozi nov dogodek  se kot snezna kepa odvali po zivljenjih vpletenih in nase lepi grozljive spomine  potlacene travme in zbije maske z ljudi  ki so se do vceraj poosebljali zaupanje  Snezno bela kepa slej ko prej pride do umazane  razmocene  blatne zemlje  In ko enkrat izruva tudi korenine  ni poti nazaj Na povrsju gre za klasicni kriminalni triler  ki se v svojem drobovju loti temeljnega vprasanja iskrenosti in lazi  Incident  ki na zunaj zamaje druzbo  dalec od naslovnic in javnih polemik razcepi bistvo zakonskih odnosov  Prvoosebna pripoved treh zensk je ves cas subjektivna ter prav zaradi tega neposredna  brutalna  kruta  na trenutke ze kar odbijajoca  saj avtorica predstavi enosmerni in dvodimenzionalni pogled na zensko vlogo v odnosu  kar bi znalo razkaciti marsikaterega bralca  V pisateljicini domisljiji zenski prostor v druzbi namrec dolocajo samozavestni  krepostni moski  ki se brez vecjih tezav polastijo zenskih misli in jih usmerijo proti njim samim  Ideal ljubezni  ki si ga trije glavni zenski liki pricarajo na izkrivljenih podobah  pa se razbije na lastnih dvomih in razklanih sanjah iz preteklosti  Iz tega pa se ne more roditi nic prijetnega  Kljub tehtnim pomislekom  da se avtorica teme loti prevec lahkotno in da vzbuja vtis  kot da globoko v sebi sovrazi zenske  pa je bil njen namen vendarle prikazati svet  ki se odvija za zaprtimi vrati  stran od oci  ki vidijo samo popolno zunanjost brez razpok  In ravno iz tega je mogoce razbrati kritiko druzbe  v kateri je ultimativni cilj vzdrzevanje neizmerne  vseobsegajoce srece  Vedno in povsod  Ne glede na vse  Konec koncev pa ne gre pozabiti  da gre v prvi vrsti za zanrski roman  ki vendarle doseze svoj cilj Vsi ljubitelji zanra bodo prisli na svoj racun  saj zgodba vlece in se bere hitro  Ceprav so v njej vidne jasne sledi avtorice  ki je svoj slog brusila z ljubezenskimi romani  in kljub temu  da je glavnega negativca mogoce uganiti precej pred zadnjo stranjo  zaradi cesar konec izgubi nekaj smrtonosnega naboja  knjiga ne razocara  Samo ne smes imeti previsokih pricakovanj  Zgodba je temacna  vendar kljub temu zabava Objavljeno na damjanzorc net  Highly recommend this book if you liked Gone Girl  not as good  but pretty close   It has similar concepts and definitely keep you guessing  First of all   Rachel  Girl  There are many apps that won t let you drunk text or email  Why your friends   well  acquaintances  really  didn t tell you about them is a mystery unto itself  Now on to the actual review  This was an online book club read for September that I breezed through   it s an easy read  and I spent quite a bit of time at the airport and on planes for the holiday weekend  so I finished this a lot faster than I expected  I haven t read Gone Girl  so I wasn t familiar with the narration style  but that made it all the more interesting to me  In fact  I would argue that one of the things I loved about this book was the narration and plot style  See  I m the type of person who reads the final conclusion of a mystery  because to me  the final conclusion itself isn t the most interesting part   it s how you get to that point  So  this was especially interesting to me because we knew  for the most part  how the story ended   a lot of the book was really about piecing together how the story got to that point in the first place  both by revealing what happened in the past as well as the current events that reflected what happened in the past I do have to say that the last twist wasn t as shocking as the book jacket made it out to be  IMO  An interesting twist  maybe  but I think there was more than enough foreshadowing to keep it from being completely shocking  Your mileage may vary though But yeah  this is a good read  Recommend it to anyone that likes a good mystery and or is maybe a little bit nosy  Whew   what a heart pounding suspense story   This novel is pure  thriller entertainment that kept me guessing at the end of nearly every chapter  The plot centers on Rachel  a divorced alcoholic who refuses to accept that her marriage is over  While riding the London commuter train daily she spies on a couple in her former neighborhood  she fantasizes that they lead the ideal life she has lost  Another neighbor  Megan  goes missing and Rachel  in a drunken stupor  thinks she may have witnessed or participated somehow in the disappearance  I found the telling of the story from the viewpoints of the three women  Rachel  Megan and Anna  a bit confusing at times  but the technique enables the reader to get inside the heads of these women as they find that appearances and reality are rarely the same  A great summer read  be sure you have nothing pressing to do because you will have a tough time putting this book down  Gostei da forma como livro esta escrito  Mas e um tanto previsivel  This is my first crime thriller of the year and it blew me away  I had no idea what the book is about when I had picked it up and until about half the book I was still at loss as to where exactly is the story heading  But was it a ride after  I loved all the characters mainly because everyone in the book has shades of gray and that is how real characters are supposed to be  The emotions were real and took their time to settle in and yet the story was fast paced  Definitely recommend  Hsnan Hn wqt  n  ltqT  nfsy w  yd lhdw l Wan b d tlk lrHl  lmt b  lmlyy   blGmwD wlbHth wlshkwk   fy lbdy     lyk  zyzy lqry lntbh qbl qr  tlk lrwy  l   d   shy

vendas    It seems like every psychological thriller book involved disturbed women nowadays is grouped as  the next Gone Girl   Is Gone Girl has become a genre instead a book  I set my expectation high in The Girl on the Train with hoping that this book would be twisted and mindfuck as Gone Girl  Apparently  the only same with Gone Girl is  Megan is the missing wife and Scott  the husband is the suspect of Megan disappearing  Other than that  nothing can be compared to Gone Girl  This book is written in a diary form  It feels like you are reading someone s diary that you found from behind the closet  The characters in this book are totally hot mess and very terrible person  I do not feel pity to any of the characters  I can bet you won t be able to find your favorite character in this book at all  This book is written in 3 different POVs from 3 different women and somehow they are actually connected with each other  How many of us actually can tell lies without being caught  I bet most of us know how to tell a good lies  Everyone is lying in this book  Even the memory inside the head can tell lies  Indeed  The Girl on the Train brought out a lot of women s issues in relationship such as infidelity  unhappy marriage  insecurity  vulnerability and etc related to women and relationship  And men are the starter  Women are traditionally to be blamed for everything when a relationship goes wrong  The ending is good because it gives the readers a closure like what women need when a relationship ended is a closure so they can move on with their life  I do enjoy this book because of the suspense elements and the darkness vibe I feel throughout the book  3 5 stars   4 5 starsI hated every character in this book  Every single character was detestable for their own significant reasons from Scott to all three of our main character s  But that s also the reason I so throughly enjoyed this book  The hatred I had towards a lot of these characters wasn t because they were badly written characters  it was because they were characters that did terrible things and Paula Hawkins had created them in a way that meant I had to hate them  Every character has a complex backstory and the way the story unfolds is so applaudable as we slowly get little pieces of information about each character along the way  Emotions play a big part of this book and the manipulation of them  Rachel is an alcoholic and even though watching her relapse time and time again was frustrating it was also completely immersing and interesting  these scenes were so insightful into her reactions and how she acted during these time periods  The twisted nature of every character s emotions had me completely hooked and I adored every part of being inside Rachel s insane mind   view spoiler  Okay  here goes what I thought of the actual plot  I didn t guess the murderer at all  In fact  I guessed everyone BUT Tom and I guess that was because we didn t know how well Tom and Megan knew each other until the final mystery unfolding chapters of the book  I KNEW for sure that Kamal wasn t the killer though but I was totally second guessing myself on Scott when he went psycho and locked up Rachel  The way the plot unravelled with switching dates and narratives was clever  complex and smooth that it almost makes me want to pick up Gone Girl despite the fact I ve already been spoiled  I adored the way this was setup and planned by the author and I can see how well constructed this has been  I ll most assuredly be reading anything else Paula Hawkins comes out with in the future    hide spoiler   It took a while at the beginning to get me really interested but once it did I could not put it down  I finished this in one day and would probably read it again just to see if I missed anything  Definitely read this book if you like a good psychological thriller and mystery  it will keep you guessing about what happened to Rachel and Megan  I must have had at least five theories until I figured it out  I won t spoil anything  just pick up the book and read it  it s worth it  While deciding whether I should purchase this book or not I came very close to giving it pass mainly due to the fact that I was seeing a large number of people giving the book a bad rating  citing reasons such as the fact that the characters are unlikable and the story line dull  I couldn t be happier that I decided to give it a go   The characters are in my opinion what makes this book great  the book revolves mainly around the lives of Megan  Rachel and Anna  all of them being a special kind of messed up and definitely not the type of people that you would like to have in your life  While theses characters might not be your run of the mill  good guy    bad guy   or girl in this instance  together with a person that gets thrown into the mix to be a bit of a diversion  they feel real  we all have problems and secrets and some of us handle or suppress it better than others  The story line evolves quick enough to ensure that you are not bored for a single moment and while it lets slip a few clues which suggest what is actually going on you can never be certain until the end when things unravel fairly rapidly and even though you might have figured one or two things out along the way there will be a surprise or two waiting for you  albeit dark ones  I haven t read  Gone Girl  so I can unfortunately not draw that analogy but what I can tell you is that this is a spectacular read that will keep you tapping your kindle s screen without the slightest feeling of duress   This is a quick read  and thoroughly engrossing  Hawkins does an excellent job of portraying an alcoholic in a sympathetic but unsparing way  and a brilliant job of using the unreliable narrator  It s all too easy to lose the reader with a narrator so unbelievable in chronicling the events that the reader has no idea what to believe  if anything  but Hawkins manages to reel us in nonetheless  as we struggle along with Rachel to sort out truth from alcoholic hallucinations and blackouts  in this captivating page turner  I don t even like mysteries usually  but it was painful to put this one down  A good job  also  of showing the gradual healing of the main character  I have to admit  though  that much as I was rooting for Rachel to heal  she was much less interesting a character sober than drunk  and as her narration of events became more sober  and therefore more reliable  the intrigue subsided  I knew the ending well ahead  it was no revelation  hence the 4 stars rather than 5  but it was a believable ending  Well done  This seemed to be an upcoming hot book and was pushed on me by some combination of the NYT and HuffPo  While it was compared in some of the blurbs I read to Gone Girl  it really has a different feel  and different resolution  than that book    it s more of a straightforward mystery suspense novel  It is told from three perspectives    Rachel  the central narrator  who is a divorced alcoholic living a frustrating life  Anna  the woman her husband left her for  who is now the mother of his child  and Megan  who Rachel has been seeing from the train every day as she comes home to her London suburb  whom Rachel has dubbed  Jess  and who goes missing early in the book  What Rachel knows about Jess and about her disappearance is unclear to Rachel  as her alcoholism blanks her memory  how these characters fit together is revealed a decent distance through the book  although I found the twists related to those revelations to be foreseeable  I enjoyed this as a read    Rachel is interesting  and the ways in which her alcoholism alter her perceptions make it so that it isn t clear throughout what has really happened to her    even if the cause of Megan s disappearance is one you may see coming  Gosto de ir as escuras para os livros  mas neste soube me ainda melhor  A historia e nos contada atraves de tres pontos de vista  mas e dificil confiar neles  pois as tres personagens tem problemas  ainda que cada uma a sua maneira  O facto de estarmos constantemente a alterar entre narrativas e personagens torna a historia dinamica  mas para mim  e a escrita da autora o ponto forte do livro  Muito misteriosa  objetiva e simples  da nos informacoes e descreve detalhes de forma realista  como se fossemos nos proprios a personagem desta historia  Conta nos pormenores que nos fazem por em causa tudo e todos  Neste livro  nada nem ninguem e o que aparenta ser  O final nao foi surpreendente e por isso perdeu uma estrela  Ja a meio do livro tinha algumas desconfiancas sobre certa personagem  mas ainda assim acho que a autora conseguiu criar um desfecho plausivel  Um livro nao e so o final  e muito mais do que isso  e este livro prendeu me do inicio ao fim  sempre na tentativa de tentar perceber afinal o que se estava a passar  Recomendo imenso e e  sem duvida  um dos melhores livros que li este ano  My recent selection of books has tended to be non fictional stories set in various war periods  As you would expect  they have been  heavy  books that  while I enjoyed very much  will elicit many emotional responses and empathy towards those less fortunate described both in the book as well as others who lived through these times  Girl on The Train was a nice break from that  But don t let that fool you  This easy to read story of a girl on a train immersing herself into a murder investigation yet finding herself to have been already immersed can still elicit many emotional responses although they are much more inward facing On some level we all can relate to Rachel  whether we admit it or not  Rachel  a young divorced woman finds herself dealt a bad hand over the past few years and is in a state of sorrow and depression  whether she realizes it or not  She takes the train to and from  work  every day looking out the window and at the houses she passes  Throughout her many trips past the same houses each morning and evening  she invents her own story of the people who live in the houses even naming them  This is one of the areas that I think that we can all relate to on some level but may not be eager to admit it  I daydream  Often  I don t daydream about ways that my life can necessarily be different nor do I long for that  but just an alternate world that I made up  Like Rachel  Doesn t everyone  Well if not everyone  at least avid readers who are probably reading this   living  at times  in an outside reality  or at least imagining living in an outside reality  I like my life but I also like my outside reality  It s just a parallel  I m not giving too much away with the next topic but the entire subject of divorce is one that I just cannot understand  I grew up in a Catholic family where people just didn t get divorced  Grandparents  aunts  uncles  my parents   none divorced  It shocks me not simply that people get divorced or how many people get divorced but that at one point in time you married that person  At one point in time you were head over heels in love with that person  missed him  trusted him  saw yourself spending the rest of your life with him  How can a couple go from this to  yes  divorce  but what about bitter divorce  Rachel says it best  He smiles   that wide  beautiful smile that used to make me melt   and I start to sob  I can t believe it  can t believe we are brought to this  that the greatest happiness I have ever known   my life with him   was an illusion  If you read the book you know what  illusion  she is talking about but is this  illusion  true for all couples who end in that bitter divorce  Well  that scares me  I have a perfect and happy marriage going on 5 years and can never ever imagine hating my dear husband as many divorcees do  But they probably did not think that either until  well  they did  Those were just two things that stuck with me from this book  It is a quick read and a good story  The characters are developed well and enough for the short length of the book  Being a huge fan of Gone Girl  I have to say it doesn t compare  but it s still good  Give it a read    Spoiler  When did you realize who the killer was  I tend to be very gullible in books so wonder when others catch on  I realized in the chapter when Anna found the cell phone  The first 100 pages were a little slow and at one point I wanted to give the main character a quick kick in the pants and tell her to just get herself to AA  But I kept reading and I m glad I did  Like the perfect summer blockbuster movie this book will not win any awards but that does not make it unworthy of the praise and it s position on the top of the bestseller list  I try not to think ahead too much when reading mysteries or thrillers and just enjoy the ride and it was definitely a good one  I listened to this book on a short road trip  Full of suspense  Paula Hawkins kept me enthralled during the 11 hour journey  Read it  An exciting journey with the girl on the trainVery well composed  creative and far way the dominant easy plots we come across in most best seller  The story  told by 3 women  unfolds with a lot of twists and surprises  and after the middle of the book I doubt if anyone can drop it before reaching the end of the story  Acabei de ler The Girl on the Train  A Novel e o pontuei com 4 estrelas  Nao conhecia a autora  Uma grata surpresa  Recomendo fortemente para quem gosta de um bom thriller psicologico  Os personagens tem conteudo  sao bem delineados e pensam  O plot e rico  complexo  claro e muito bem construido e costurado  This really kept my interest  I liked the multitude of perspectives and the psychological layers   This has gotten a lot of comparisons to Gone Girl  It s kind of like Gone Girl in the respect that it has nothing good to say about marriage and that every single character is completely unlikeable  That said  I did end up liking this quite a bit but am really happy I listened to it on audio  I prefer my suspense novels to be  fast paced  and the early chapters were slow going for me  Narration was very good  three narrators    and the slow build to the suspense had me riveted by the time I got to the final couple of CDs  How this book isn t like Gone Girl  The ending of this one doesn t suck  I did see the whodunit coming  but the dramatic denouement was great  Enjoyable listen  Loved it as I knew I would  Did not see  who done it  at all   Great ending     Almost could not put it down  A hint of Hitchcock in this book  It was pretty good  I liked the ending  I didn t see it coming  But I did think it had some slow parts  And in the beginning it was a bit confusing who was talking  I didn t realize each chapter was a different person  Maybe that was just me     Lives up to the hype  4 5 stars   HauntingI had read a couple of bad reviews  so I avoided this book  Do yourself a favor  ignore the bad reviews and read it  The Girl on the Train is a thriller  which will leave you breathless in the final moments   I really didn t want to like this  and I didn t    I loved it By rule  I read books that fly under the radar somewhat  and because this book has been so in your face it actually put me off wanting to read it But succumb I did  and I am glad I did  Firstly I think a huge plus was that I have been in London  I ve sat on the trains  I ve looked out the windows and seen snippets of people s lives    so it was easy to visualise the train  the houses  even the streets and the people The characters were really well formed  I m a fan of an author who uses the the right amount of characters and uses them all  rather than you wondering  what the hell is he doing in here  with regards to under formed characters The prize for cliff hangers  this author is a serious contender  Totally left hanging at the end of each chapter I just really really enjoyed it  Great debut and I look forward to more from this author as I am sure she has received a heafty advance already for a second novel Could you spot the twist with a 100 pages to go  Yes you could  But you were never too sure were you  After a short period of not reading because I ve been so busy  I felt practically malnourished and starved of wordy garnishments  I was in need of something quick and meaty and bad for you  like the morning after the night before when you crave macdonalds  Girl on a train over delivered  More like a gourmet burger  It oozed with calorific characters which I could not gobble up quick enough  The story kicked along at a pace of an inter city and the rumble on the tracks was palpable too  To get an undiluted taste of the real and disturbed lives and minds of those visually  Normalish  people was refeshing  To be honest I can t decide if the disappointment I felt towards the too cheesy final line was due to the malfitting flavour or just that I realised the meal was over  Yes there were a couple of extra gherkins hidden under the bun which were unneeded and unasked for like the authors over obsession with the term intolerable but over all it was well written and kept me well satiated throughout  So often I find a good thriller is spoilt by the logical sleuth thought processes of the narrating investigating plod  I greedily slumped down the thick milkshake of the irrational idiosyncratic viewpoint of Rachel  quenched my misery quota from Megan and frothed at the mouth with Tom  Scott and Anna  It might not be Michelin starred but still I felt it was a masticatory masterpiece which hit the spot as a sumptuous snack between meals  This book was absolutely 100  realistic fiction  There was nothing about the plot that wasn t unimaginable  everything makes sense and fits right into place  The main character  Rachel  doesn t have a fairytale like life  with love and beauty and all of the cliches of a romance book  She has faced so many hardships  and even the end  though happy  leaves her scarred  I recommend this to anyone who is sick and tired of books that are too sweet and want to read something that will make their throats dry and their heartbeats accelerate   Not going to lie  I got really wrapped up in this book and had trouble sleeping in my apartment alone  It s a goodie   I enjoyed this audiobook  but if you are a multi task listener then either read the book or save this one for when you can concentrate  maybe driving or resting vs  cleaning  being online  paying bills  etc    Also  many people have compared it to Gone Girl  for me it had some style similarities  but it really ended there  I only so so liked GG but liked this one so much more  possibly b c  1  I liked the ending   resolution  and that there even was one  and  2  I could relate to Rachel  addiction recovery  ex issues  not same as hers   I have 2   and rode the train to fr work for 16 yrs  The characters are realistic  I ve come across ppl like most of the characters   I m sure many others have too and  yes like some ppl have noted   a hot mess   but there are a lot of hot messes out there   I used to be one on a tamer level   but that s what makes it   idk what   maybe creepy  troublesome  relatable  Not to mention it s a debut book  can only imagine what else she has in store  unless a one hit wonder  As for describing it  can t add much more than description above other than maybe to say  that I don t think it mentions  the  girl  riding the train is trying to stop drinking   her flashbacks include drunkenness   blackouts AND she used to live on the street where the couple she watches does  but I don t think they lived there at the time  It s worth a try and if it s not your thing then don t finish it or finish it and then you have one more thing to complain about     Loved the book  I didn t want it to end   I would award this book 3 5 stars  if the system would allow it   You don t know her  But she knows you   Rachel is having a tough time  she s lost her marriage and her job and is a very heavy drinker  Her ex husband Tom now lives in their old marital home with his new wife  Anna and their daughter  Rachel is living with an old friend from university  but has not told her she is unemployed and keeps up the ruse of commuting to work  Her commute is where this story starts as Rachel passes her old home every day on the train she becomes a voyeur and feels she knows something  hurried in her memory when a local woman goes missing I cannot fault the way this story was told the narrative and characterisation were exemplary  I did find it somewhat predictable and so the conclusion lacked the wow factor for me  The Story is told very cleverly from the point of view of three female characters  Anna  Rachel and Megan  I loved how the story slotted together when told from these three different points of view  However  there was one thing that kept bothering me about the story and it was simply this  Rachel s inebriated memory  blackouts  leave her clueless  however after an extended period of time those memories become more prominent and real to her  This simple premise made no sense to me  None of us remember better later  memories do not work that way  A good thriller  but predictable and spoilt  for me personally  due to a big plot hole  This is a difficult book to review  I found it fascinating but very depressing  This must be the first book I ve read where there is not a single pleasant  sympathique in French  character  I had to keep reminding myself that this is fiction and that although people like this probably  certainly  exist in real life they are few and far between and do not make up 100  of the population as in this book  I found the book difficult to read with the alternating multiple first person accounts and a mixed up chronology  Nevertheless I couldn t put it down  I m ashamed to say that I had this morbid fascination for these self destructive psychotic characters  hoping against hope that one of them would show someIt is a not book I would recommend to anyone who is feeling down  It should in fact have a  black box warning  on it as do dangerous drugs and those that can lead to suicidal thought and actions I ve heard that Spielberg has bought the film rights   I am certainly not going to see the film although I am curious to see if he can resist making any of the characters just a bit  sympathique   Very much enjoyed this book  some parts could have went a bit faster but there was a great plot twists  I listened via Audible so I think hearing it made the main character even more annoying but I am sure anyone that you listen to that has an addiction would be equally annoying  Overall a great listen read  I would recommend to anyone who wants a story that has mystery  murder  mayhem and some drama  Un thriller para cautivar a cualquiera  Fantastica trama  dificil de descifrar hasta mas de la mitad del libro  al menos para mi  Suena un poco raro que sea una mujer la autora de un libro tan  masculino   Esto demuestra el potencial de las personas  capaces de realizar todo aquello que se propongan  entre ellas  Rachel  I read this in one sitting  While I was worried that the premise was too much like Gone Girl  there were enough twists and turns to keep me hooked  Great read  fast and entertaining   Iedere werkdag is het hetzelfde

depressie raakte  Elke dag hetzelfde beeld dat aan haar ogen voorbijtrekt  Tot op een gegeven moment er iets merkwaardigs plaatsvindt  De buurvrouw Jess van een aantal huizen verder kust  s morgens niet haar man gedag om hem een leuke dag te wensen  maar is een innige omhelzing met iemand anders  Is Rachel hier getuige van een geheime liefdesaffaire Helemaal spannend wordt het als deze zelfde vrouw ineens van de aardbodem verdwenen is  Het ergste wordt gevreesd  maar zolang deze vrouw niet gevonden wordt blijft alles mogelijk  Rachel leeft zelf in een schijnwereld  zo blijkt al snel  Ze probeert het werkelijke leven te ontvluchten door veel te drinken  Ze woont inmiddels op een kamer in huis bij een van haar vriendinnen en probeert naar anderen toe de schijn op te houden dat ze een geweldig leven heeft  Niks blijkt echter minder waar  Door haar overmatige drank inname herinnert ze zich dingen levendig die niet echt gebeurd zijn en kan ze zich juist die dingen die wel echt gebeurd zijn niet meer herinneren of heel vaag  Als de bewijzen dat Rachel iets met de verdwijning van de vrouw te maken heeft een steeds hardere vorm aannemen  wordt het Rachel toch wel erg heet onder de voeten  Als ze uiteindelijk naar de politie gaat om haar verhaal te doen  raakt ze verstrikt in haar eigen leugens en wordt ze niet meer serieus genomen  Maar heeft ze nou wel of niet iets met de verdwijning te maken Het meisje in de trein leest als een    Nee  dat is te makkelijk he  Het boek leest erg makkelijk weg  Eigenlijk direct al vanaf het begin zit je direct midden in het verhaal  Zoals een trein betaamt  neemt hij je direct mee op het moment dat je er in zit  Er is eigenlijk sprake van een heel kort beginstukje want de trein dendert in rap tempo voort  Het verhaal wordt verteld door Rachel  de hoofdpersoon  Je beleeft haar dagelijkse tochtjes alsof je er zelf bij aanwezig bent  Zoals vermeld wordt deze dagelijkse sleur als snel verbroken door    Ja waardoor eigenlijk  Zijn het hersenspinsels van Rachel of is er meer aan de hand  Het verhaal laat je als lezer lange tijd in het ongewisse  Je leert de levens van de hoofdpersonen steeds beter kennen en ook hoe ze met elkaar samenhangen  Naast Rachel zijn er nog vier karakters die een belangrijke rol spelen in dit verhaal  Al lezende wordt steeds duidelijker dat ze allemaal een masker lijken te dragen en niet  echt  zijn wie ze naar de buitenwereld beweren te zijn Je zou de opbouw van de spanning kunnen vergelijken met een aflevering van Baantjer waar de hele tijd de gedachte boven je hoofd hangt dat er ieder ogenblik een flinke twist in het verhaal kan komen  Lowietje maakt ineens een opmerking waardoor alle verdenkingen ineens op iemand komen te liggen die vooraf niet verdacht was  Deze vorm van verdachtmaking spreekt mij wel aan en houd je als lezer dicht bij het verhaal betrokken  Paula Hawkins heeft voor bijna alle karakters toch een soort  jack in the box  moment gemaakt  waarin ze allemaal iets op moeten biechten  Aan het einde van het boek zijn alle karakters duidelijk uitgewerkt en is het overgrote deel van de onduidelijkheden die je aan het begin en tijdens het lezen zou kunnen hebben gekregen weggewerkt  Is de relatie tussen de ex vriend van rachel en zijn nieuwe vriendin wel echt zo rooskleurig als Rachel denkt  is de psycholoog van Rachel wel zo integer als hij beweerd te zijn en wie is toch die vrouw Jess die plotseling verdwenen is  Heel subtiel wordt uit de doeken gedaan wat er zich nu werkelijk allemaal heeft afgespeeld de nacht dat de vrouw verdween en wie ervoor verantwoordelijk is  Heel origineel is het niet  maar de manier van vertellen daarentegen weer wel  Als lezer word je namelijk zelf ook beinvloed door het vertekende beeld dat Rachel heeft op de wereld als gevolg van de alcohol Het meisje in de trein is door de VN Thrillergids verkozen tot de thriller van het jaar 2015  Dat Paula Hawkins een heel uniek geschreven verhaal heeft neergezet is overduidelijk  Dat we in de toekomst meer van haar zullen gaan horen  of lezen  is ook geen twijfel  alleen of dit nou echt het allerbeste spannende verhaal is van het afgelopen jaar daar valt zeer over te twijfelen  Het is een lekker boek om te lezen  maar onderscheid zich toch niet op een heel positieve manier echt van andere thrillers  Doordat de verwachting vooraf erg hoog was  viel het boek toch een beetje tegen  Het boek schommelt een beetje tussen de drie en de vier sterren als het gaat om spanning en originaliteit  Omdat de schrijfstijl goed is en het hier gaat om een debuut krijgt ze toch het voordeel van de twijfel  Vandaar een matige 4 sterren voor  Het meisje in de trein   Psychological thriller keeps you guessing  Real page turner   Very nice The book started great and continued till the last word  A well crafted story  a riveting read  The characters were very well etched  Wow  This book gripped me from the start   I couldn t stop thinking about it throughout Highly recommended by both friends  family   online  really enjoyable  thrilling   not too obvious The characters are flawed  much like those in Gone Girl but I found myself caring about them in a very unusual way Kept me interested  Well written   I would recommend to others  Great narration on audio book  An easy listen with interesting plot Comecei a ler este livro por insistencia da minha filha  que o tinha lido e tinha achado fantastico mas que  no entanto  me fez a seguinte recomendacao   nas primeiras 100 paginas nao vais achar nada de especial    Confirmo   Realmente achei o primeiro terco do livro um pouco enfadonho e confuso  ainda para mais que a historia tem 3 narradoras  Rachel  Anna e Megan Mas a medida que a historia avanca e vamos conhecendo melhor as personagens nunca mais conseguimos largar o livro  e a cada capitulo que passa vamos desconfiando de uma pessoa diferente Muita boa leitura para quem gosta de thrillers psicologicos  I enjoyed this read and found myself eager to figure out what was going on  I don t think any of the characters were terribly likable  which makes it a challenge to feel invested  I did like the book and enjoyed the descriptive imagery   The cover copy makes this sound like Rear Window  and there are definitely nods to that movie in the book  but it is so much more than that   it owes a lot to the play and film Gas Light as well  Rachel is an unemployed  divorced alcoholic who takes the train into London every day to look for work  Her friend landlady believes she is still working  The train pauses on the track behind Rachel s old house  where her ex husband Tom lives with his new wife  Anna  Just down the street are  Jess  and  Jason   a couple Rachel doesn t know but who she watches from the train every day  making up a story about their life in her head  One day  Jess   real name Megan  disappears  and Rachel has some information she thinks will help  Jason   real name Steve  find her What follows is a mystery in which almost every single character is a suspect  including the narrator  Rachel is incredibly unreliable  something she freely admits to herself  since her drinking often leads to blackouts  Tom frequently told her about the things she did while drunk during their marriage  Then there is the fact that she only knows what she saw from the train  and given that she was already making assumptions about these people her eyewitness account is not trustworthy  Hawkins writes a great mystery  but she also writes wonderful character sketches of men and women who treat each other badly in different ways  Everyone  including the missing Megan  is fully realized in all of their goodness and badness  I loved how multifaceted each of these characters is  Nothing and nobody can be trusted  but after the plot tears through you you will have plenty to think about in terms of relationships  abuse  and dependence   I did not like any of the characters in this book but they were such train wrecks you had to keep reading just to see what would happen  I did not guess what was going to happen so it was a good read Every morning and evening Rachel rides the train past the neighborhood where she lived with her husband Tom a few years ago  Although he has a new wife and a young daughter  Rachel can t let him go  A few doors down lives another couple Rachel has named Jess and Jason  She watches them compulsively  envying them for the perfect life she imagines they have  None of these people  including Rachel  are who they appear to be  and two of them are hiding deadly secrets Despite this novel s melancholy tone  readers who love unreliable narrators will be consumed by it  The characters aren t particularly likable  but the suspenseful  twisting plot will keep readers turning pages until all the characters  secrets are revealed  A great beach read  This is definitely a faster paced Gone Girl and I couldn t wait to download and crank this out  I m a sucker for hype and this suspenseful story is buzzing all over the place and I couldn t help myself  I normally read book club books since I am in 6  However  I pushed that pile away and jumped into this  I m finally getting around to my review after letting this book swim in my head for a bit and decided this is probably a 4 5 star rating for me  It is not fabulous literature  but it is a page turner with many twists and it makes you realize the typical cliche   NOT everything is as it appears to be  Rachel  Megan  and Anna set the stage for this thriller ride and present the reader in each chapter with their personal voice  However  this is a train ride that literally leads to betrayal  death  and unexplained circumstances simply by witnessing a couple on a daily commute  This tale has the jilted lover  the other woman  the cheating wife  and spins into maddening chaos with the men involved  Jump on this author s first attempt at writing  It will NOT disappoint  This was  as described on the cover  a compulsive read  A hard to put down  suspenseful thriller  full of secrets along the way  Told from the perspective of 3 female characters  all flawed with unreliable perspectives on the situation  no one seems trustworthy  I enjoyed how Rachel evolved  and how everything wove together  I enjoyed it right to the last page  I did love the way that the characters developed and converged  I figured out the perpetrator about 2 3 way through  but it was still suspenseful and well written  I hope she writes more  I m not sure how to review this without giving anything away     but lets just say      Rachel  Megan  Anna  Thrilling page turnerMasterful writing and unreliable narrators kept us guessing on what the truth really was  Excellent character development with Rachel and Megan  Recommended  Had me from the first page and kept me up at night wanting to get to the end faster  Total page turner that will keep you guessing  So wish I had read this along with friends so we could discuss it from start to finish   3 5 stars  This is like nothing I ve ever read before  Yes  I ve read  Gone Girl    I wouldn t compare them It opens with such a sad and pathetic individual as the main character  Rachel    who rides a train into work every day and passes the same places  One where she used to live  She has a drinking problem and makes up fantasies of the people she sees in these homes each day  It is really an odd sort of novel  None of the characters are likable  but you just have to find out what happens to them in the second half especially We are learning the story line from the voice of 3 female characters  in present day  and in a few months past  I found it easy enough to follow  At times Rachel s part seemed repetitive  but she was trying to work through what she thinks she saw that resulted in a crime  and so it came across as believable  The critics reviews are mixed on this  Make up your own mind  and don t compare it or expect it to be like anything else you ve read before    The Girl on the Train  e un thriller psicologico che vi fara dubitare delle apparenze e vi portera a domandarvi su quale siano i segreti che nascondono gli estranei   The Girl on the Train  is a psychological thriller which will make you doubt of appearances and take you to wonder about what are the secrets that strangers hide  Full review Recensione completa  http   petrichorabookblog tumblr com     Hard to put down  but about halfway through I felt it was very similar to the plot in  Gone Girl   Some parts were a bit too predictable but overall I enjoyed it  Quick read  I m not quite sure why this book was so often compared to Gone Girl  I thought The Girl on the Train was a much more believable book  particularly the ending  and one that I enjoyed much more This was a quick read and one that I always looked forward to getting back to  I liked the story being told in 3 different character voices  and I also thought it was very clever how the timetables differed and the story just about caught up at the end when it all comes together  You certainly can never tell what s what with anyone s life simply by observing from a distance  Things are not what they seem as this book proves spot on  And I found a new favorite literary friend in the book s primary character  Rachel  And some pretty despicable ones as well  I think this book could be open for a sequel  but in any event I would read another book by this author  Great job for a debut novel  I stayed up late to finish the book I started yesterday  The Girl on the Train  When I started the novel  I expected not to enjoy it  I didn t like the main character  I found her behavior childish and her choices weak and poorly made  It took a little time for me to connect with her because I had such issues with her behavior  Slowly I found myself drawn to the character and her interactions with the others around her  I found her entanglement with perception and memory  as well as to the impact of alcoholism on both  compelling  While I knew exactly who had done it and why well before the end of the book  I felt that it unfolded beautifully and told a story that was enjoyable as well as insightful  Aspects of the story which I have chosen not to reveal because they could easily be spoilers for some readers were realistic and cleverly presented Part of my hesitance in picking up this book was my reaction to Gone Girl  Everyone I knew liked it  I hated it  I found it predictable from beginning to end  and I hated almost all of the characters  Girl on the Train did not strike me the same  By the end of the book I felt the character Rachel had developed  that Anna developed and changed  and that both had made a necessary journey to reach the end  The closer I got to the end of the book  the more compelling it became as a read  I did want to see how the author was going to finish it and I was not disappointed So  if you are interested in a little murder mystery reading that isn t challenging but is twisty and fun as a read  with some moments of insight and realism  I encourage you to pick up The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  Hmmm I m not sure what to say about this book  It was like I was reading two different stories with the same characters  It started out a certain way but of course it ends totally different  I like the surprising turns that each of the characters takes and the authors keeps you guessing until toward the end  Even though I did suspect the little twist  the author did a good job keeping the reader guessing with all of Rachel s foggy memories and alcoholic blackouts  The beginning was a little monotonous  but if you stick with it  I promise it gets better and doesn t disappoint  Me gusto y lo recomiendo porque es un libro muy sencillo de leer y desde sus primeras hojas logra engancharte con la trama  me gusta como vas descubriendo poco a poco pequenos detalles que te van dando una idea mas concreta de lo que la historia quiere contarte  hace mucho que no me pegaba a un libro de esta forma  asi que por eso le doy cuatro estrellas   spoilers  Ahora  si queremos hablar algo negativo sobre el libro  para mi   Algo que realmente no me gusto fue que en un momento llego ser muy predecible la decisiones de Rachel  realmente cansaba y un poco que aburria cada tonteria que hacia  Bueno si queremos interpretar a una alcoholica psicologicamente maltratada  tienen un punto  Pero    En serio Y tambien es cierto que cuando se descubrio que no se sabia quien era el hijo de Megan  se predecia por descarte  quien era el villano  aunque habia la esperanza que la historia te contara algo mas que cambiara esto  pero no fue asi El desenlace si que me dejo un sabor incompleto  me imaginaba algo mas a lo sicosis o asesino serial  pero hubo sangre  lagrimas y un sacacorchos  asi que tan mal no fue En conclusion es una historia muy atrayente  en especial en lo comunes que son los personajes y que si retrata la realidad  porque la mayoria de asesinos no son gente rara que vive aislada  todo lo contrario  son gente que parece tan normal como tus vecinos  por eso no pude dejar de leerlo hasta acabarlo  Tenia que saber como acababan los personajes  Una lectura muy recomendada para un viaje en bus o tren  creo que se leeria con un poco mas de placer en el trayecto a estudiar o trabajar  asi que cada vez que levantes el rostro para darte un respiro  podrias imaginar  como Rachel  una gran historia de las miles caras que vez pasar cada segundo  With this one being first book from this author has curated best of fictional thriller world that a reader could dream of  With right amount of everything served through words  this book is the best read and worth all anyone s time  It took me really big amount of time to finish this book but eventually I m pleased and entertained at the end  If not my favorite but still one of the I d consider reading again for one more time  I loved every characters  life and view are explained with detailed words  Although there is just one main character but you can see that other characters are also treated with great care and nurture  Every one gets to say their own side of story  Their pain  their happiness and every other feeling they have for characters within the story  And word  phrases and syllables are aptly opted and worked like a charm  Slight of troubled because of author being a British  haven t really read any in past  Lies  betrayal  physical relationship out of marriage always lead to some messy outcome and never fading scars  How could someone even fathom to go to betray the persons who love them deep from heart  Or its just the thing that non deserving ones always get every thing they shouldn t  don t and never deserve  Alcoholism is a one of a kind cancer but that what two people promise each other when they get married to standby in any cancer  Oblivion and ignorance often seldom go side by side  How often do we dig deeper than that of catered to us  But hope everyone after this book to be contrast to what Rachel and Anna were  And running from a problem is not a firm or lasting solution  Wish Megan would known it  There are Toms every turn of life but there re also Scotts there s too  Hope everyone will enjoy reading this one and see you in next review Ciao  Couldn t identify sympathize with any of the characters  but enjoyed the tension and mystery of the book  Well written and kept my interest till the end  I really liked this book  I figured out the solution ending answer within the first quarter of the book but was never quite sure  wondering if the writer might pull a rabbit out of her hat  She didn t  but that was good  I found the resolution quite satisfying Ps I listened to this as a library e audiobook and the three female narrators were so totally spot on  Megan was particularly well cast  I know I m the last person to get on this train  ha    WARNING  HERE BE SPOILERS   just in case people yell at me I listened to this on Audible  twice  and I think I ve finally formed an opinion on it  I really did enjoy it  and I can see why people are comparing this to Gone Girl  However  the similarities between the two are only limited to the woman goes missing  it s a mystery novel and there s a big twist  The morals are completely different  Gone Girl is more distinctive in its morals  whereas The Girl on the Train is more of a traditional  whodunnit  story  And listening to the story twice definitely helps put the finale into perspective  especially when studying the character of the culprit  I won t spoil that here  The best way to absorb this novel would be on audio  If you re umming and ahhing about signing up for Audible  I d suggest using this as your free novel  The voice actors are three women  Clare Corbett  Rachel   Louise Brealey  Megan  and India Fisher  Anna   I m already familiar with India Fisher because of her work in Big Finish  she plays Charley Pollard  one of the Eighth Doctor s companions   They all do an excellent job at making the voices distinctive  and it s going to be hard to separate those voices from the actors that ll be appearing in the film  which I believe is coming out late next year  Emily Blunt is playing Rachel and I reckon she ll do a good job  provided that she fattens up a bit  I don t recognise any of the other actors  I heard buzz that they were switching the location from London to the US  but it looks like that s just a rumour  4Overall  I enjoyed this one  but I suggest if you re wanting to take the plunge  to listen to the audiobook   Four well deserved stars   holding the e reader until your knuckles are white suspense  Check  unpredictable plot  Check  drama  murder  psychological twists  CheckI thought the plot s layout  being unraveled through the same train journey and every time giving us a bit more information  was pure genius  It kept you on edge and changed course of your thoughts  suspicions each time  Why not five stars  Because the characters were ALL so unlikable  You could really not sympathize with anyone  By the time you learned the truth behind some of Rachel s problems  it was too late for any sympathy  Putting it all in perspective  they were all really f ed up people  It s impressive to see them all in one story  and that made it unbelievable  Lastly  the prose was just too plain  I get it that it fit the characters  but I always want something more on text  Having said these  I would still pick another book from the author    4 5 stars Amazing thriller  Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time    Original review   SPOILERS on my blog  http   booksbyj blogspot com 2015 02     I received this eARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review  I was super excited to get into this book  a lot of people resembled it to Gone Girl and don t get me wrong  I LOVED this book   but Gone Girl cannot be topped  This follows Rachel  a woman with too many troubles of her own and discovers an escape everyday on the train  She watches a couple on the terrace of their house and fantasizes about their relationship   their names  their jobs and their personalities  One day  crisis strikes and disrupts her already messed up life  Rachel finds herself involved in stuff that she cannot get out of  She was an unreliable narrator  one of many characters that I strongly disliked  All of the characters in this one were faulty characters and they were just terrible  I must say that this book was kind of boring at the start  it took me some time to get into it  Once I did  I was trying to crack the mysteries and figure out where on earth did the missing person go  I was juggling possibilities and honestly  I didn t see the ending coming AT ALL  I didn t see ANYTHING coming and that s why my rating was that high  The writing was phenomenal  Paula Hawkins made me visualize everything so perfectly and she had this ability of incorporating random clues throughout the book that tie in perfectly in the end  A mystery thriller genius  I must say  All in all  this book was a fantastic ride  it had me thinking to this very day and I feel like it did stick with me  I remember every detail vividly and I m writing this review a month or so after reading the book  that s an indication of how good it was  On the other hand  this book was a bit graphic  I would NOT recommend it to young readers   Very sure footed  particularly for a debut novel Paula Hawkens  book is a mystery tale  with a clever structure  just shy of abusing the reader  but never quite  The story starts with Rebecca  who commutes on a train to and from a job on the outskirts of London everyday  She comments in the morning  and again in the evening  at irregular frequencies  She s a drunk  and sad  and puts all of her hope into a couple she sees from the windows of a train The story then switches gears  stepping back a year and into another character  Megan  who also records her days in the morning and evening  We learn that she is loosely connected to Rachel s story  although that connection becomes increasingly tight  after Megan disappears The story proceeds on two tracks  pardon the pun  for a time  Megan s thoughts leading up to the day that she disappeared  and Rachel s growing involvement in the investigation around that disappearance Soon enough  a third track is added  the story told from the perspective of another woman  Anna  who is married to Rachel s ex husband  We are given to know that the break up of the marriage was bad for Rachel  throwing her deeper into her cups  pushing her to harass the new family  particularly after Anna and Rachel s ex  Tom  have a baby The story is given its narrative momentum by the careful restriction of knowledge coming to the reader  Part of that restriction comes from the structure  with its jumps in time  part of it comes from Rachel s drinking problem  which leaves her often unable to remember what she has done in the past This careful doling out of information has given rise to a couple of invidious comparisons  A review by the New York Times on the back says that Hawkens is playing with an unreliable narrator  but that s not the case  Every narrator is fairly reliable  quickly recanting bad information  Their understanding of the world matches the world as we know it  except to the extent that they do not know certain things There s also the  inevitable  comparison to Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl   The title alone  with the  Girl  in it  invites the comparison  and possibly some opprobrium  but Rachel is a girl  She got lost on the way to adulthood and never made it there   But the characters here are not like the one in Gone Girl  who was an unreliable narrator  and who was  almost  always in control  The characters here are more like those in Flynn s earlier two books  damaged and driven by bad impulses  They are female noir characters The most unkind comparison would be to  In a Dark  Dark Woods   The only similarity is that the main character in each is a lonely British woman with memory problems  Here  the character s memory problems are rooted in the story  and so do not feel like a cheap trick  Nor does the structural withholding of information  its part of the fragmentary story telling style  one which echoes Rachel s own experience of the world The central mystery isn t particularly mysterious  I figured it out at about the half way point  and I m usually slow on the uptake  But all mysteries have to be solved  and part of the joy of any mystery is seeing how the author has created and crafted the mystery and the world  and that keeps the reading engaging  One also wants to find out exactly how the characters will continue to screw up their lives  which they do   Train wreck is another pun that suggests itself  The only real drawback here also comes out of the structural choices Hawkens makes  Because she is withholding information  because the focus remains on the mystery  because the narrative flips through time and cuts out pieces of it  the characters never fully come to life  By no means are they entirely flat or stereotypical  Hawkens is too good a writer for that  But they are thin  two dimensional  Too much of their thought  of their being in the world  is hidden   The psychiatrist thing  though  is a bit over used  A minor flaw  though  all things considered  and this is a superior mystery  Really well done  This was an interesting read  The first part was a little slow to get into  but once you did you were quite hooked  I still have a few questions that were never answered  and i did kind of see it coming but not to soon it was still a surprise This is a solid suspense mystery if you are into them  I just struggle to really like any of the characters  All in all if you like mystery you will enjoy the twists and turns of this one   Though I did not care much for any of the characters  the book was extremely well written  The author did an amazing job of building the intensity of the plot  It did start a little slow  but as the story progressed  I just could not put it down  I had to find out what happened to Meghan    the missing girl  I did however predict correctly who the killer was  The author also did a great job of portraying the life of an alcoholic  I couldn t put this down  Gone Girl meets Bridget Jones  Drags a bit at the beginning but by half way through zips along through a series of unexpected plot twists  Great characters  It s easy to get through this book when you realize all the characters are unlikeable and you truly don t care what happens in the end   you just want to get there and see who gets theirs  The twist isn t completely unpredictable but the ending left me really satisfied  it fills you with dread  A taut storyline  Involves marriage  its breakdown  aftermath  alcoholism  cheating  everything but above all  the banality of it all  Told from the eyes of the girl who travels on the local train in London and sees it all  what she doesnt see she imagines well  Not too much romance in the typical sense but aftereffects of love are what causes the whole complex situation Resena breve y sin spoilers en mi blog  http   www mairenaruiz com resena the    This book really surprised me  I wasn t expecting much from it  but I found myself reading it way past my bed time and when I wasn t reading it  I thought about the story  the story flows very well and has limited amount of characters  which is great  because you are not having to remember them all and go back to see who said what etc  The characters all meshed very well  If I have to say one negative thing about the story  is that it was to easy for me to guess who killed who  Fast paced and very easy to read  perfect book to sit down with over an afternoon or two and become absorbed in  The character development is well done albeit the making of some deeply disturbing individuals  The actual plot is fairly simple and not really unique  mostly a  whodunnit   but there are twists and turns that keep it interesting and I found myself consistently struggling to believe anything I was reading  Worth a read     Life is not a paragraph  and death is no parenthesis    I read Gone Girl more than a year ago  and I completely enjoyed the messed up novel  The Girl on the Train received a huge amount of praise because of its comparison to Gone Girl  There s no concrete similarity between the two  but there is a slight resemblance in terms of the theme  They are both psychological thrillers and I have to say that I really enjoy that genre  It would seem like a spoiler if I were to mention the ones talking in the novel  There are alternating chapters  but it would be safe to say that one of them is Rachel  She wasn t my favorite character while reading the novel  but there was something about her that made me want to finish the book right away  There was a sense of pity felt toward her  She seemed so desperate and crazy that I had to know what really happened  With a likable but imperfect main character  this novel turned out to be a better psycho thriller than expected The premise was absolutely compelling  There shouldn t be a reason for someone not be interested in the novel  When I read the summary at the back  I immediately bought the book even without checking the rating and some reviews here on Goodreads  despite what I normally do  A girl who takes the train everyday  but what she does while on the train  at a certain stop point  makes you rethink about public transportation and privacy  rThat being said  I had very high expectations  and gladly was satisfied after reading this  The other characters were even better than Rachel  the snooper who didn t seem to mind her own business  Their lives were a fun thing to read about  despite all the craziness  The crazier the better when we re talking about this genre  I would ve liked it more if the author spent less time narrating  view spoiler   Megan   hide spoiler   and spent more time focusing on  view spoiler   Anna   hide spoiler    I understand how important the former was as compared to the latter  but sadly I liked the latter one way better  My favorite character in the novel would have to be Tom  Stating my reason though might lead to a spoiler  so let s just say he was the most interesting one of them all The reason why I rated this a 4 would be that it didn t reach the peak of my expectations  There was no major plot twist that really caught me off guard  I honestly saw everything coming  but that doesn t mean I didn t enjoy reading the novel  It was compelling despite knowing what s going to happen next  and in the end 4 5 5 stars  The only thing lacking would be the sense of surprise  but other than that  this was an amazing novel  If you liked Gone Girl  then odds are you ll enjoy this one way or another  Highly recommended   Lo primero que tengo que decir sobre este libro es que vino desde Uruguay y no me lo esperaba para nada  Me hizo muchisima ilusion  de verdad   Por otro lado  no tenia intencion de leerlo tan pronto  porque tenia algunos en lista que llevaba tiempo queriendo leer  pero encontre un grupo de gente haciendo una lectura conjunta de  La chica del tren  un dia antes de terminar de leer  Historia de dos ciudades  y pense que era una senal  asi que me apunte a mi primera lectura conjunta  La verdad es que ha sido entretenido ir leyendo los comentarios de la gente y poniendo los tuyos de manera que solo el que hubiese leido supiese de lo que hablabas y evitando los spoilers a los que fuesen mas retrasados Pasando ya al libro en si  la verdad es que me ha gustado mucho  Es un libro que atrapa mucho  narrado en primera persona por distintas voces protagonistas  te interna a cada capitulo en un mundo diferente  a pesar de que apenas se mueve entre uno o dos escenarios  Lei un comentario de alguien diciendo que podria ser facilmente adaptado al teatro y estoy completamente de acuerdo  dado que los escenarios son super simples  y perfectos  creo que el libro no necesitas mas  La trama es bastante sencilla de seguir para tratarse de un libro de misterio  y eso me ha gustado  No hay grandes quiebros y te lleva de la mano haciendo que te plantees distintas teorias  Es posible que sea algo previsible  no lo se  tal vez es que yo estoy tan loca como algunos de los personajes y en cierto modo les leia la mente     Los personajes han sido de hecho  para mi gusto  el punto mas flaco de la novela  No es que esten mal construidos en si  pues creo que dentro de sus papeles  estan de hecho bastante bien  mencion especial Rachel   pero es que he sentido que son demasiado directos  No quiero matizar esto demasiado  pero es algo que he sentido con varios de ellos  que eran previsibles  el arquetipo de un personaje llevado al extremo  En general es un libro que me ha gustado mucho  Un misterio facil de leer e interesante  Gracias a Anita Vela por organizar la lectura conjunta  Ha sido muy divertido    4 Este livro foi me oferecido por uma pessoa que  apesar de nao o ter lido  achou que se identificava comigo    porque de outra forma nao o teria lido  pois sempre achei que queriam fazer com este livro o mesmo do Grey  com tanta publicidade e mais a adaptacao para o cinema  desvalorizei a historia   E  o certo  e que fui surpreendida  e muito  pela positiva Apesar de nao gostar de narradores na primeira pessoa  neste caso  isso nao se veio a revelar um aspecto negativo  porque a autora teve o cuidado de organizar a historia pelo ponto de vista das tres personagens principais  e acaba como sendo um diario ou uma conversa com cada uma delas  por isso  gostei imenso de conhecer a Rachel  a Megan e a Anna desta forma  tres personalidades distintas com quem simpatizamos e antipatizamos  e que aparentemente pouco tem em comum  mas que juntas dao origem a esta historia que realmente se torna de leitura compulsiva  absorvente  perturbadora e que nos deixa sempre em duvida ate quase ao final   Posso mesmo dizer que  tendo em conta as minhas leituras deste ano que se basearam essencialmente em autores  preferidos   Paula Hawkins ja conquistou tambem lugar cativo nessa lista  resta me aguardar pelo seu proximo livro  ja em 2016     Quick  dark  suspenseful thriller which is sure to be this year s new viral  Gone Girl  substitute  I liked it much better than  Gone Girl  though in that it was more plausible and the characters  although flawed  aren t so over the top evil  The story is told by the three female leads   Rachel  Megan and Anna   but  primarily Rachel  Rachel is THE girl on the train who witnesses something odd while glancing out the train window on her regular commute to the city and she begins to make disturbing discoveries  She is drawn into a situation that is adding to her already depressing life situation  Rachel s character made me want to abstain from ever drinking any alcohol again  She is a total disaster  We learn about all the characters gradually and there is a murder to be solved  When I thought I could make a guess as to who the murderer was  the author introduces a new plot twist   background information  family history  a recognized but unknown commuter  a judgmental police officer  etc  This was a real page turner  Would recommend to readers who like murder mysteries   an easy one two day read  It was fun to read with a large group in my Goodreads women s book club  Can t wait to discuss it in our spoiler folder  I bought the book and would be happy to share it with anyone interested in reading it next   This book has been getting a lot of attention lately  I feel like most of the books I read are a few years old  they were published 3 or more years earlier  but sometimes it s fun to read something right when it s at its peak  That s what I wanted when I picked this for our April book club read  Rachel is an alcoholic  still bitter about her not so recent divorce  and faking her commute to work each morning so her roommate won t realize that she s been fired from her job  Her daily commute also serves to feed her obsession for a couple that she obsessively watches along the route  When she sees something suspicious one day while on the train  and then discovers that the woman has been murdered  Rachel begins to insert herself into the life of the man she watches in an attempt to find out what has happened to his wife  Through her frequent blackouts and blurred memory  Rachel tries to solve the mystery all while continuing to stalk her former husband and his new wife and child  This is another example of a book  eh eh    unavoidable Gone Girl reference there  where the main character is unreliable  at best   where none of the characters are likable  Rachel was desperate  Anna was smug  Megan was selfish   and where everybody seems to make dumb decisions  And  yet  I still enjoyed it  The book was a fast  fun read  a bit unnerving and creepy towards the end  and it kept me on my toes  Smarter readers will probably figure the end out before I did  but I like being gullible  especially when I find a book that scares me just a little like this one did I did find the sections told from Anna s point of view annoying at first and I thought the time differences between sections were a bit confusing  They were too close together to have been separated the way they were  yet I m not sure how the author could have done it differently  Just in case you were curious  the six people from my book club who read the book all liked it  I did think that was surprising  but it supports the mass appeal of the book and validates the attention the book has been receiving  This isn t the easiest book to get your hands on right now  if you don t want to fork out a little cash for it  so I have a copy if you want to borrow  4 1 2 starsI thought this book was great  It had me hooked from the very beginning All the characters in this book have secrets  They are all basically deplorable  NO ONE can be trusted  This sets up for an awesome thriller read I have seen a lot of people compare this to Gone Girl  I can kind of see the connection  I thought it was much more like Alfred Hitchcock s movie  Rear Window   Like jimmy Stewart  Rachel is an observer  She creates fantasies of the lives of people she sees when the train stops at the same light every day  She sees their house  She watches them  She does it to fill the emotional holes in her own life  Rachel is an alcoholic  One day she sees something that shatters the image of the perfect couple she watches  Of course  she doesn t know them  She has merely invented this perfect scenario  She becomes infuriated over what she has seen  She drinks and blacks out often  Someone comes up missing  The suspects are plentiful  My mind spun with the possibilities  I was thoroughly captured by this book  I couldn t put it down for the last half of the book  as sleepy as I was  When the end is such a mystery and you just HAVE to see how it ends  sleep is for wusses  This is one of those books that will keep you up all night  It is entirely creepy  LOVED IT    There s nothing so painful  so corrosive  as suspicion   2015 Reading Challenge   A book published this year Ok  esta fue una muy buena lectura  Entiendo toda la comparacion con Gone Girl  pero yo no los meteria en la misma bolsa  Queria aclarar eso Para ser la novela debut de Paula Hawkins me parecio todo muy bien ejecutado  Si bien no me atrapo al instante  no tardo demasiado en hacerlo  Queria leerlo todo el tiempo  y mucho mas teniendo en cuenta que amo este tipo de novelas  Es el tipo de historia que pone a todos como sospechosos en algun momento  en serio  a todos  y eso lo hace aun mas intrigante  A mi me sorprendio  pero no fue un plot twist tan inimaginable como me resulto el de Gillian Flynn con Amy y Nick  Sin embargo  hasta cierto punto no tenia idea de como iban a resultar las cosas Lo unico que creo tener para criticar es que el final no me parecio que haga justicia a la gran historia que se venia tejiendo  Es mas  me parecio un poco estupido y  descuidado  No se    me decepciono un poco y me parece que podria haber sido mucho mas interesante a pesar de que te tiene ahi  al borde de la silla por la tension Se lee bastante rapido y no es demasiado larga  Disfrute mucho del lugar donde esta situada y como la autora hace del tren un personaje mas  Me gusto mucho  y tengo muchas ganas de volver a leer algo de ella en cuanto decida escribir  es una gran novela debut   All aboard     TRUST NO ONE  I have lost control over everything  even the places in my head  What   Trust No One   Why is that sign on the railroad of this review  Is this a  The X Files  story  Oh  no  but certainly the motto of that iconic TV series is a good advice to anyone who dares to aboard this train of thought in this very particular journey to the minds of three women that you may think that they are quite different  but      maybe not      or maybe they do      mmh      remember about trust no one       we ll even you should not trust me neither      bwa ha ha ha ha   No  I m kidding  I m your friendly reviewer  surely you can trust me      bwa ha ha ha   Okay  enough misleading malevolent mirth    for the moment    BROKEN DOLLS  There s nothing so painful  so corrosive as suspicion  In this story you will have three voices in your head   Rachel  An alcoholic woman who failed in marriage Megan  A pretentious woman who succeed in cheating Anna  A married woman who who succeed in pretention All of them are unlikely protagonists  hardly role models  sinners paying for their own faults  broken dolls in the middle of a railroad where fate is the train They did their mistakes  but your own mistake can be to trust them    or me      bwa ha ha ha    WHAT WORKED BEFORE  WILL WORK AGAIN  There s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home  You may heard that this story is the  new  Gone Girl  and you would have heard well then Actually  while it s understandable that everybody knows about Gone Girl  there is another newer book that it could considered too into the formula in a sense   Gone Girl meets Elizabeth is MissingAnd also  there are two movies that came to my mind  no wonder  from the master of suspense  Alfred Hitchcock  who I have no doubt that if he would be still alive  he would adapt into a film this novel    Rear Window meets The Lady VanishesThat  yes  they were based on previously printed material too So  if you are fair familiarized with all those mentioned stories  you can quite well expect lots of trains  losses of memory  missing women  vouyerisms and misleadings   Bwa ha ha ha       wait  Why did I laughed this time  I believe that it s one of the moments where you can trust me more    or isn t  EVERYTHING IS ACCORDING TO THE PLAN  Life is not a paragraph  and death is no parenthesis  You may notice or not  while reading the different railroads  that the debutant  Paula Hawkins  the author  didn t put anything random on the book  everything is according to the plan  even the dates  that honestly  they aren t easy to keep on mind  but even those dates denote different kind of railway engines  while a side of the story can be told as a paused steam locomotive  another side is indeed a bullet train But in any case  life hardly can be told in an instant  even the fastest deposition needs time  life is rich  life is complex  and if there is a saying that  each man is a world   well I can say that each woman is an universe  a wonderful universe full of surprises  and while maybe in a whole another kind of context but  death  is hardly an ending  but just other twist in life And what could be life without those wonderful unexpected twists  This was the first book I have ever read as part of a book club  It isn t one I would typically have picked up off the shelves to read on my own  but I m glad I read it  It took a little while to get used to the switching back and forth of perspectives  I could have really used some head shots of the characters  Paula Hawkins   but it was well worth the initial confusion  A great thriller that left me stumped until about three quarters of the way through   but granted  I m not usually the first to figure it out  It was more than your typical  who dun it   weaving an interesting tale of betrayal and manipulation through multiple story lines that all converge in the end  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read mysteries or just likes a good story with believable characters   I loved this book  My husband and I were browsing a bookstore in St Pancreas as we waited for our train  how fitting  when I saw this book  I had heard about it from friends and decided to buy it  I m so glad I did  I found it a bit tedious at the beginning through the mundane train journeys with the star of the book  Rachel  I soon warmed to her and actually became concerned about her  willing her to stop drinking     to make herself a new life somewhere away from Tom  I loved the  Jason   Jess  fantasy Rachel created as I think  sat on a boring train gazing out of the window it can be quite easy to speculate about those you can see in their houses as you pass  never to see them again  Except Rachel does see them  constantly and so it begins  I strongly recommend you read this book  the characters are fascinating I found  none of them very likeable  all with a past and their lives embroiled in a most sinister way  I m only giving it 4 stars as I did find it overall a depressing read   but still  a great read  The story held my rapt attention for the first 75  of the book while each chapter was told from the point of view of one of three unlikeable women  It was as though I was reading their diaries  and the author captured their voices with poignancy and authenticity  The alcoholic s story was spot on  The author draws a portrait of a woman who is desperate for purpose but who is defeated by her self loathing  obsessions  and manipulations  She makes promises that she knows she will not keep  and she undermines any credibility she might have  In fact  each of the three women sabotages herself  Some might find this murder mystery plodding at first  but I enjoyed the opportunity to acquaint with these women who were more damaged than  bad   The tempo changed during the final quarter as the loose ends are tied into a cogent conclusion  and I think the story lost some of its soul at that point  It became a crime drama instead of a thoughtful character development  Still  it was an enjoyable read  and I look forward to more from this author  Really good story  Some parts were kind of slow  but I won t spoil anything by giving details  The ending was a huge surprise  Couldn t put it down at the end   This is an excellent psychological suspense thriller  Rachel catches the same commuter train every day  It stops at a particular signal each time and she looks out over to a row of houses and to their back gardens  and she often sees a  perfect couple  living out their lives there  If only she could be as happy as them    But things are never quite what they seem  and Rachel soon gets involved in their lives  which she finds starts to connect with her own broken life  This has been one of the best selling books of the year   and I can see why  The suspense and unease gradually builds and I couldn t turn the pages quick enough towards the end  Rachel is a flawed character but you do really feel for her predicament  I would definitely recommend this book  its a cracking read   This review appears on Happy Indulgence  Check it out for more reviews  If you took the time to look up from your phone or book while on public transport  what would you notice  The Girl on the Train takes a simple  everyday concept and morphs it into a nail biting thriller  where a girl on a train becomes a key witness for a missing person Rachel is an interesting  obsessive character who is deeply flawed as a raging alcoholic and struggling post divorce  So what else does she do when she sees a happy couple every time the train goes past  She makes up ideal lives for them  But as we get intertwined deeper into the mystery  getting an insider perspective couldn t be more different You ll get several different point of views here  from the past  the present and from various people  Absolutely everyone could not trusted and had their own secrets  They were all dysfunctional  only projecting to people what they wanted them to see  Although I did end up predicting some of what happened  my mind was racing all the way through the novel wondering who the culprit was  Rachel s memory loss and what really happened  The tension in this thriller was high  not knowing how things were going to unfold and being glued to the pages until you reached the final  chilling crescendo Adultery  depression  mental illness  domestic abuse and violence  The Girl on the Train makes us question what we see on the surface  and what s behind closed doors  It makes you realise no one is as they seem  and we often project our own wishes  thoughts and feelings upon people we encounter  It s amazing how much Rachel idealised her perfect couple  and the stark contrast that was presented as we got to know more about them  It makes us question  do we only see what we want to see Although The Girl on the Train didn t give me the mind fuck that Gone Girl did  I was still glued to its pages wanting to know what the final outcome would be  With a seemingly simple premise  the author morphs it into an overlapping web of intrigue  mystery and lies told through several unreliable narrators  If you love psychological thrillers  this is a great one to pick up and read on the train  What a great summer read  Really enjoyed the tool of using the train in the story  My face was always pressed against the window hoping for another clue   It was about page 210 that I could say what will happen in the end and I was right   DIt was a good read  with lots of ups and downs  I enjoyed it  Great thriller  All the characters pretty much cray cray   I finished this book last night  and I have been debating how to rate it  It s probably more of a 3 5 star book for me  There are things I really liked about it  I loved the chapters by three different characters  taking place in the morning or the evening  It was definitely easier reading this as a  real  book rather than on my kindle  because I often turned back to see what had happened when the person had last written  or what had happened at the same time in another character s life  I enjoyed the mystery   a woman is missing  and a group of people in a neighborhood had possible motives  Two things I didn t like  none of the characters were likable  and the ending confession seemed too contrived Rachel is an alcoholic  who s lost her job and her husband  but still takes the train into  work  so she can appear to be working to her landlord friend  She sees the flats in her old neighborhood along the way  and notices a  perfect couple   In her mind  she names them  imagines what they re like  and feels as if she knows them  One morning  she sees something strange   and the mystery begins  I felt sorry for Rachel   and for many of the characters in the story  Each one is her his own worst enemy  and no one is strong enough to resist temptation  or to make a change for the better  I think there are many people like Rachel in the world   they WANT to be a part of things  they want to be liked  to be helpful  to make a difference  but they have such a difficult time separating fantasy from reality  Some reviewers  I noticed  said the culprit was too easy to figure out  Not for me  I had no idea who was guilty until quite a way through the book  So  I liked the concept   but I wish I liked some of the characters more   WEDNESDAY  NOVEMBER 18  2015 MORNINGIt s 8 o clock in the morning  I am running to the train station  There are two trains I can catch  at 8 07 am or at 8 10 am  If I leave my home exactly at 8  I can catch 8 07 train but if I am 2 minutes late  I can get 8 10 one  Anyway  that 3 minutes doesn t really matter that much  I will reach 3 minutes late at work but today  I can t wait to catch 8 07 train because I can t wait to get to the train station and sit in there  and start my new book  Yes  I am starting my new book today called  The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins   Its a murder mystery  I saw there are mixed reviews about it on goodreads but sometimes I don t like to listen to those reviews  I just want to read even though they say it s bad  Shouldn t we see ourselves why they say its bad  and the only way to see it is  by reading it  Anyway  I have a good feeling about it  Its not always I read mystery books  I open the book and read it  The train is quite packed  Germans like working early  It s really really packed  There is no seat for me  I am standing but I am reading  Few pages into the book  its time to get off   EVENINGIts nearly 8 pm  I sat on the train and opened the book  Hmm    this is about a girl Rachel who is drunk all the time  She lost her husband to someone 2 years ago but still hasn t gotten over it  Recently  she lost her job too  In order to avoid telling her flatmate about the job  she pretends to go to work  Everyday she takes the same train into London  From the train she sees her old house which is shared by her ex husband and his new wife now  She also sees their new neighbours who she doesn t know but have now become familiar figures since she sees them almost everyday from the train  She names them Jason and Jesse   I am now home and can t wait to finish my dinner and go back to the book  At around 10 pm  I start reading again  So the neighbours of her ex husband are Scott and Megan  although she named them Jason and Jesse   One day  from the train  Rachel discovers Megan kissing someone who is not Scott  Soon after that  Megan disappears completely  Her disappearance becomes a big talk of the town  Rachel  thinking that it might be something to do with a guy she was kissing  goes to Scott to tell him what she saw   I am completely engrossed in the book  Next time  I check the clock  its 2 o clock in the morning  I should sleep now   SATURDAY  NOVEMBER 21  2015 MORNINGThis is my 4th day in this book  The story is getting interesting  I am back to the book  I confess it s bit boring in the beginning but after 50  its getting interesting again  They have found the body of Megan now but who could have murdered her  and why  and why I do I feel like every character in this book is messed up and has sort of psychological problem  but something is making me read it though  There is something interesting which I can t describe  probably an urge to know who exactly is the culprit and why  Anyway  I have got shopping and laundry to do now  I will catch up with this book later   EVENINGWhat     It was him  Oh my beautiful God  I couldn t have imagined it in any way  Its been 4 hours that I am reading this book continuously  For some reason I could t keep it down  Now  its finished  time to read its reviews on goodreads  SUNDAY  NOVEMBER 22  2015 MORNINGWhy is everyone talking bad about this book  It was ok for me  May be I don t understand the real taste of the mystery since I don t read them that much but it was not that bad  Atleast this book has taught me that people s lives are not as same as they show you  Long time ago my friend and I had a big argument over someone s post on Facebook  I told him why he can t be like that  someone   His argument was  Not everything is same as people show you on Facebook   I felt exaclty like that after reading this book  Everyday I take trains and although it was somewhere behind my brain  I never properly imagined everyone sitting there has some stories  This is the book that shows you the prospective of lives from other s view  Oh well  I got to be honest  I kind of enjoyed it so  I will give it 4 stars  Scheisse  Tomorrow is Monday     But Rachel is living a lie and dealing with alcoholism and a very active imagination Jess and Jason are really Meghan and Scott and are not living the ideallic life Rachel has conjured for them a few doors down from Rachel s ex husband  This story is full of plot twists  lies and suspense and it was really hard to give a hoot about any of the characters  I did find it hard to stop listening to it though because I wanted to hear how things really happened and not how Rachel imagined them   This book is SO GOOD at what it is good for  I do see things about it that could be better executed in terms of the writing  but I m happy to admit I was riveted   I enjoy enjoyable things  This book is written with three points of view in turns  Rachel  the primary POV  who is an alcoholic  whose failed marriage finds her living with a roommate in suburban London while her ex husband  Tom  has stayed on in her former home with his new wife  Anna  and their baby  Rachel takes the train into London every day  so her roommate won t ask her why she lost her job  drunkenness   and the train stops so she can see the gardens of her former neighborhood  including the home of Megan and Scott  Not long into the novel  Megan goes missing  and Rachel thinks she has seen something material to the case  Of course  given her erratic history and current alcoholism  she is not the police detectives  most reliable witness  The page turning ness of the novel takes place as the three perspectives intertwine  Rachel s  with Megan s and with Anna s  who has the fewest pages devoted to her POV  This book  like Gone Girl  is so easily envisioned as a movie  and indeed  one is coming out in 2016  with Emily Blunt starring as Rachel  It may also be one of those movies that are better than the book  At first I found it interesting  and perhaps intentional  that the three female narrators  protagonists  if you will  merged together a great deal in my mind  Is Hawkins trying to make a point about the necessary conformity of suburban life for women  Or is she not writing the characters well enough to make them truly different people on the page  The ending is one I did not see coming  but it also one of those that simultaneously surprise and yet seem inevitable  It only surprised  I didn t think enough of a breadcrumb trail was left in the narrative to make the turn seem natural  organic  even if there are readers who saw it coming  I found the examination of Rachel s alcoholism very interesting  I ve never read anything about this written in this way  It endows her with a pathos that Megan and Anna don t have  even though I think Hawkins wanted to endow Megan similarly  the writing just isn t rich enough for her  it s too expository rather than illustrative  Anna is very two dimensional  even in the end  But  as I wrote at the beginning  I m giving this book four stars because it is GREAT at what it is good for  a page turning  suspense novel  plot driven and fast paced  It s not something that will keep yielding fruit upon more readings  but as  plain fiction   it s pretty engaging   I enjoyed this book  I wanted to know what had happend  I think this is a good book  but not as good as everyone is saying  Every morning Rachel  a lonely divorcee  rides the commuter train to London  fantasizing about the lives of a happy couple that she sees everyday who live in a home by the tracks  She s named them Jess and Jason  and they have a wonderful life in her mind  Rachel is envious  she feels connected to them  Then one day on the train she sees something strange  brief as she passes  so much so that Rachel doesn t know if she really saw it or if it was her imagination  And when Jess disappears Rachel finds herself swept up in a investigation where she may know more than she realizes The Girl on the Train is a remarkable debut by Paula Hawkins  The story telling capitalizes on multiple first person narratives  blending styles reminiscent of Gillian Flynn and S J  Watson to craft a clever story told from disparate viewpoints  Rachel  for all her good intentions  is terribly self destructive  questioning both her judgement and her motivations for getting at the truth  Rachel invented Jess and Jason s happy life  imagining them how she wanted  There are stories we tell ourselves  and stories we choose to believe  And now Rachel wants to know what really happened It s been a while since I read a suspense genre story this fresh  Although I had some suspicions a quarter of the way in    some that proved true    The Girl on the Train is a very smart  well paced thriller  There are some pieces of the story that I think could ve been fleshed out more but Paula Hawkins gives readers just enough to know her next book should be short listed  The Girl on the Train is a psychological thriller about a girl named Rachel who takes the same train every day  passing the house of her ex husband  Tom  and his new wife  Anna  as well as the neighbors  who Rachel calls  Jess and Jason   She finds herself feeling connected to Jess and Jason  as if she knows them personally  One train ride allows Rachel to witness something shocking that she believes will help solve the unusual disappearance of  Jess   When she approaches Jess s husband with this information  she finds herself more involved than she expected   My attention was definitely kept during this novel  Anxiety  along with curiosity  took hold of me and it was hard to put the book down  Hawkins also did a fantastic job with character development  which left me feeling as though I knew each character personally  especially the main character  Rachel  I sympathized with Rachel and felt her pain  felt sorry for her  It s hard for me to actually connect emotionally with a character  but Hawkins got the job done This book is narrated by three women  Rachel  Anna  and  Jess   I must admit  at first I was a little confused by the timeline  but that confusion quickly left me once I continued on a little further into the book  I can actually say that I wouldn t have preferred the book to be written any differently  Reading the perspectives of each character allowed me to connect with and understand each character s feelings a lot better than had it been written with one narrator This is one of the better thrillers that I ve read in a while  and I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys reading suspenseful  unsuspecting  Who Dun It s   I can promise you  you will never guess the outcome    I didn t  This is definitely a book for lovers of  Gone Girl   A classic whodunit but written in the multiple perception points of view that made books like Gone Girl such a hit  This psychological thriller happens to be set in England  and has a bit of English slang in it from time to time for those maybe not accustomed to British speak  But in short  the book was done very well  I liked the multiple personalities the book had  as it made you keep pieces of the story going in your mind that were happening concurrently  but from different perspectives  That tool was a bit disorienting at the beginning of the book as the reader has little warning that it is going to happen  as well as no reference point to establish the personalities of the different narrators until you were well into the story  The storyline itself was actually pretty good and extremely well thought out  As the author  I can t imaging what her whiteboard had to have looked like as she plotted out the story from start to finish  Even a rough draft would have to be pretty intricate  Then weaving the tale together through the maze of all the different points of view  brought everything together and pulled off a wonderfully thrilling read  Definite psychological thriller  And that appears to be the book genre of the year  No more Harry Potter hats and wizards  no more vampires and werewolves  now we have the newly invented psychological thriller in which authors attempt to outdo themselves in originality  In this case  I give it 4 stars because Gone Girl was better  more shocking  but in this book  Hawkins still gives you entertainment well worth the price of admission   The Girl on the Train is actually a story about three different women   Rachel  a miserable drunk  Megan  a meandering slut  and Anna  the pinched up woman who stole Rachel s man  So many women s novels now hinge on multiple points of view  and while it s often used to drum up suspense  for me  it sometimes tends to pull me out of the story  which it did here  Hawkins does a fine job of characterizing an alcoholic with all her faults and black outs  and I think the novel might ve benefited by staying strictly in her voice  The reader only gets to see events through her distorted vision and wonder what is true and what isn t However  the narrative line is derailed by two other cringing voices that in many ways tend to collide into one another and sound like the same woman  For example  both Anna and Megan complain over and over again in their dated day and evening entries about how bored they are with suburban life  Their lives effectively either revolve around children or primarily the men they re involved with  No wonder they re whining The plot is told to the reader through quick  jarring entries which coincide nicely with a day to day commuter s life  though the drawback is that scenes where the reader gets to participate in the action are few  As for the ending  I predicted it twenty pages in  There were no red herrings  no other real suspects to consider  and while the writing is strong The Girl on the Train slows midway in momentum and becomes a somewhat monotonous  one way read  Ecco qui la mia recensione su uno dei libri piu in voga di questa estate  La trama e molto accattivante  Rachel e donna alcolizzata  la cui vita e andata in pezzi dopo il divorzio da suo marito Tom  scappato con un altra  ha ormai un solo momento felice e di svago  quello in cui il treno che prende tutte le mattine per andare a lavorare a Londra si ferma ad un semaforo  permettendole di spiare la vita di una coppia sposata la cui villetta e vicinissima ai binari  Rachel  nella sua estrema solitudine  si e affezionata ai due coniugi  belli e innamorati  che tutte le mattine fanno colazione in giardino  arrivando perfino ad inventare dei nomi per loro  Tuttavia una mattina vede qualcosa di diverso e anomalo  che mandera in pezzi le sue fantasie e creera un inevitabile collegamento tra lei e la coppia Mi fermo qui per non rovinare la sorpresa a chi ancora non lo ha letto In giro per il web si dice veramente di tutti su questo libro  Dai paragoni con  La finestra sul cortile  del maestro Hitchcock  a quelli con il piu recente successo di Gillian Flynn  Gone girl  breve parentesi per consigliare a tutti quelli che non hanno visto il film di Fincher con Ben Affleck la lettura di questo meritevolissimo thriller   quanto a me    Beh sicuramente non e all altezza di nessuno di questi due paragoni ma  merito soprattutto del susseguirsi di una serie di colpi di scena ben costruiti e dei capitoli brevissimi che spingono sempre a pensare  ma si  ancora un altro e poi smetto   questo libro si legge tutto d un fiato  impossibile staccarsene La storia e tutta al femminile  narrata dalle tre donne protagoniste  ossia Rachel  Anna  la nuova moglie di Tom  e Megan  la sposina   che pero per i miei gusti sono poco caratterizzate  troppo simili tra loro  alcolismo di Rachel a parte  Nel complesso il mio giudizio e comunque positivo  7 10Passate a trovarmi sulla mia pagina Facebook  per scambiare opinioni e consigli  www facebook com quandounlibroticambi    I highly recommend the audio version of this book  The various British actresses narrating the different character points of view are fabulous and give each character a richness and depth that might not otherwise be felt if you just read the print version  It seems that all the reviews are either love it or hate it  I loved it  I really did  The writing is solid  smart  and tinged with the right amount of mystery and intrigue to make you want to pick it up again  The unreliable narrators are compelling in their delusions and make you want to find out more about their motives  their backstories  and how they fit into this puzzle of a story  My only complaint about the novel is that it s a bit too slow in the first half  Rachel  in all her alcoholic glory  is really given too much time  in my opinion  although I see why Hawkins gives her so much time  It does build up the mystery  but this could have been done in fewer chapters  I noticed that a lot of people have complained about hating all of these characters  I didn t hate anyone but Anna  really  I felt a soft spot for Rachel and Megan  For fans of smart Brits revealing their dark sides  this book is a must read  I did like this book  but I did not love it  From the early pages  you know there is a young woman who has disappeared  The book goes on  slowly at the beginning  faster after a while  by giving you daily accounts from three persons  Rachel  the main narrator  Megan  the missing one and Anna  the new wife of Rachel s ex You meet a few characters  Tom  Rachel s and Anna s husband  Scott  Megan s husband  Kamal  Megan s therapist  plus some who fill up the empty spaces  like the 2 police inspectors  or Rachel s landlord Cathy You know something has happened to Megan  but you don t know what  at least for a while  and you try to guess who is the bad one until the end I still have not understood who leaked stuff about Megan to the police  when no one knew about it  nor the characters situation with money  Scott and Tom bought houses with their wives  then Tom bought Rachel out  How come she is broke then If there is a big loan on the houses  how can they afford to pay for it when their present wives  Megan and Anna don t work anymore I have more questions  but they would be spoilers Anyway  that is what blocked me from loving the book  It is good  it would be better if those plot holes were fixed  Maybe too the very limited amount of suspects who are eliminated one after the other for bad reasons  after being suspects for worse reasons Another thing which bothered me  It s the glowing reviews from Tess Gerritsen  S J Watson and others  You expect something amazing  while a little voice tells you it is just well organized publicity   4 5 stars Girls  Girls  Girls I loved the way the book was written  the story was well thought out  great flow  The story is told from the perspective of 3 women  Rachel  Megan and Anna  This gives us a better understanding of the drama that involves all 3 women  and when I say drama  I mean Drama  Very thrilling read  kept me turning pages  I did have a theory 100 pages in and it turned out I was right  although throughout it did make me second guess myself a few times  I enjoyed this book and believe it lived up to the Hype  Thank you Paula Hawkins for the entertainment  This is my first attempt at ever reviewing a book so please excuse my inexperience  Pros  Gripping  page turning thriller yet also atmospheric read  Great description of the surroundings  Very dark  loved the alcoholic POV  Multiple perspective done really well  All the women were interesting  Mystery is done well  unlikeable complex characters with secrets unravelling at a consistent pace  No boring parts  Cons  Small con only  Grubby  This is a PERSONAL dislike but I felt disgusted at how dirty  bloody and unravelled the main character Rachel was  As a daily commuter  smelly coats  drunks and bleeding nails on the train are a nightmare  I had guessed the suspect quite a bit before the big reveal      SPOLIER     I guess I had a problem with Megan s POV exclusively leaving out Tom s name in order to maintain the mystery  The mystery depended on Paula Dawkins withholding the killer s name  It wasn t as if we were given all the information and we needed to piece it together  Maybe if Megan s point of view was presented through different mediums or varying levels of detail for each encounter with these men would disguise how heavily this story depended on Paula withholding vital information  This is a debut  Everything is refined  I am only nitpicking after all  Really  the descriptions of the street  the suburb  neighbourhood and the English countryside were wonderful  It was witty and interesting  Wow  what an insane read  Be prepared for a roller coaster ride  I couldn t decide if I liked the characters but yet I wanted to figure them out  Great story telling  strange characters coupled with just enough mystery to keep the reader flipping through the pages aggressively They are calling this the next  Gone Girl  but I feel it s a close second   The Girl on the Train  is definitely my first favorite for 2015  Treat yourself to this read  you will not be disappointed  3 5 starsIt took me 4 weeks to read this  however the last third within a span of a day while commuting to  fro work  I persevered the first half of the book  nearly giving up  It wasn t a page turner as what other readers have mentioned  It was only the last third of the book when I really got into it  I can see why people comple this book with Gone Girl though I really do hope that the trend of having twists will fade  if not it will not be so unexpected  Just look at M Night Shamalan  I really loved this book  it was one it took me quite a while to figure out the ending too which is always exciting  I really understand what they meant by it being similar to gone girl  even so far as the characters go  Megan seems to be similar in some ways to Amy  except maybe more emotional and involved I was struck by how much I disliked the main character  and whilst I later became sympathetic towards her  I still did not necessarily like her  though I don t think you were meant to The excerpts at the beginning of the book were a very nice touch  as was the use of intertextuality  in particular the ee cummings quote  life is no paragraph   and the continued appearance of the phrase  don t expect me to be sane about this  The way in which the characters interacted with one another is decidedly post modern  emanating that sort of Wheeler esque approach to relationships  the lack of emotion  the subject of children  such as in who s afraid of Virginia Woolf  in which their inability to have a child nearly tears them apart   extramarital affairs  and a general disillusionment and disassociation with life are present I cannot think of a word to describe Anna and Tom s relationship that does not sound ablist  so I guess I ll just have to say it seemed almost clinical  Hawkins has an amazing talent of being graphic and descriptive without in fact describing  Some points we noted were the way in which she described the G T s Rachel would drink  the holiday drink evoking the memory  and the horrible scene of the baby in the bath  that was not at all spoken of in detail  yet succeeded in being incredibly distressing to read or contemplate   Fun  quick page turner  I agree with others that it s not as good as Gone Girl  but still very enjoyable  Reminded me a bit of a British version of Gone Girl  I enjoyed how things weren t as they seemed  Even though I figured out the  whodunnit  of it all pretty early on  I wanted to keep reading and stayed up late to finish this  I enjoyed the different narrative voices for each woman and the way the story explored the darkness and imperfection not only in human behavior but also  highlighting the flimsiness of memory and how misleading public appearance and our perception of others can be  Unlike many modern stories of this kind  there was a pretty tidy bow wrapped up at the end which can be a good or bad thing  depending on your tastes  Random side note  the story is set in England and I learned what I can only assume is British slang  as I ve never heard it used in the US   the word  grizzle   which I know to mean like  Grizzled  rough  old woodsman hermit with a beard and rough edges  and this book uses repeatedly in relation to a baby  seemingly replacing a term like  fussy   So  there you go  It was very  Gone Girl   maybe even a little bit better   A lot has been said about The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  particularly in comparison to Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl  Both are thrillers with unreliable narrators at the centre and both have stuff to say about women and modern relationships  I love them equally   it doesn t have to be a choice  does it  This isn t Desert Island Discs   but I think the main conceit is better in Train than Gone Girl The Girl on the Train follows Rachel  who is spiralling out of control after the end of her relationship with her ex husband  She takes the same train every day   apparently to work   and as the train stops every day at the same signal  she invents an imaginary life for the couple who live in the house opposite  It s a life she obviously wishes she had  and at the first opportunity   when the woman goes missing   she plants herself into the story  What makes the book exceptional however  isn t just the interesting plot  It s the way it s told It can be hard sometimes to completely believe in a thriller once the main conceit is revealed  In Gone Girl  for instance  it became harder for me to care as much about the book once the moral ambivalence of the central character  Amy  is revealed   not because I liked her any less  but because it was clear then what she intended to do and the mystery was gone  you knew where the book was going What makes Rachel  in The Girl on the Train so wonderful to follow  is that she isn t so much morally ambivalent as just drunk  depressed and lost  So  we re not entirely sure if she s guilty or innocent  We can t tell if she s involved  you don t know what she s done and you can t tell if she s reliable or not  or rather  if her drunken memories are reliable or not   We have to piece together the story bit by bit  with her  and that makes it interesting  I flinched with her  every morning  when she woke up in a panic  trying to run through the events from the day before  It s a wonderful way to reveal the story  lots of oh my god what has she done now  moments and it also kept me involved in where the mystery was going until the last possible moment  It s also written very convincingly and chimes with a wonderfully written article on alcoholism and drunken  black outs  by Sarah Hepola in The Guardian this week You feel sorry for her and her need to stay involved in strangers  lives but at the same time  there s something very human about her situation and I liked her a lot  not in spite of her flaws but because of them This is taken from my blog  ellenallen co One word  Gripping  That s this book  Good suspense as well  but the main thing I liked in this book is the way how she tells the story  From three different women and traversing the time forth and back  I loved reading this and would suggest to anyone who loves crime and thriller  4 5Let me start off by saying that I gave Gone Girl  to which this book is often compared  4 stars as well  even though there was some part of me that didn t like that book  It was like a train wreck from which I couldn t look away  This was not another Gone Girl for me  Yes  everyone is just as messed up  but I didn t stick with it out of morbid curiosity  I actually cared about how it ended  The fact that everyone is horribly distorted in this story helps make it powerfully character driven  It was also well written  with psychological twists that made everyone unreliable as narrators   There are three  by the way   It became difficult to identify the fallacies meant to mislead from the clues that were actually important I also want to mention that I suspected the true killer early in the story  but it did not diminish the enjoyment of reading this and waiting to find out if I was correct  First sentence   She s buried beneath a silver birch tree  down towards the old train tracks  her grave marked with a cairn The Girl on the Train is a one trick pony  but it s a good trick  a good pony    The narration alternates between the three main female characters  Rachel  Megan and Anna  The trick is that we are exposed to each woman s inner loop  the monologue they are having inside their head  And that monologue is extremely negative  We are privy to all their paranoia  depression  self pitying  delusion  and meanness as they interact with the world around them  Wallowing is the verb that comes to mind   ha That interaction is really fascinating  The girl on the train  Rachel  sits there and  in her head  decides that everyone is silently judging her as fat  stupid  alone  a loser  etc  We  the reader  know she s just spinning negativity without it being explicitly written  This is a most effective way of showing the impact of this negativity on each girl  It s also interesting and realistic that these women use this negativity as a rationale for acting out in hurting themselves  drinking  sleeping around  or hurting those around them  lying  infidelity  The plot  the mystery  in The Girl is good enough  But the focus is definitely the lives and loops of the main female characters  It s not always easy swimming in that negativity  but it was wonderfully realistic QOTD I close my eyes and let the darkness grow and spread until it morphs from a feeling of sadness into something worse  a memory  a flashback   Rachel  The Girl on the Train  One thing I couldn t figure out  There s a lot of drinking in the story  but none of the women is on  meds   anti depressant or anti anxiety medication  I m surprised this wasn t an element of the story given how prevalent these pills are today  especially with women A good read thanks    yow  bill This book is intoxicating  to say the lease  Its twisted and warped  telling the tale of people who seem ordinary enough  But don t expect to like any of them  They re all messed up in some way and that s what makes this book great This book is well written and will entice you to keep reading long past your bed time  If you like Gone Girl  you ll like this  I enjoyed this book  The mystery and the characters hooked me right away  It was hard to put down at times  Pretty good book for being the author s first thriller  I found the book gripping enough   I just couldn t help myself to keep the book down  but turn pages instead  as I go on reading   I have seen the movie Gone Girl   so this book as well comes so close to it The best part of my reading was that  every single page held my attention from first to last    It made me like Paula Hawkins so much     A thriller very well written   This is a great  gaslight  novel  This book was a bit like a train wreck  I wanted to put it down because the main character was horribly destructive to herself and everyone around her  but I couldn t  I was very relieved to find  in my opinion  it was nothing like Gone Girl  and I wish people would stop comparing the two though I understand it s good publicity for Ms  Hawkins  My only complaint was the story wrapped up a little too tidy for my taste  and it was difficult to keep track of the jumping dates  but I look forward to reading more from Paula  I wish her the best success for such a fine debut novel  Nu mi a placut   Fata disparuta   care mi s a parut monotona si previzibila  iar cand am vazut ca   Fata din tren  e comparata mereu cu   Fata disparuta   m am gandit putin daca s o citesc sau nu  Pe masura ce citesti descoperi tot mai multe asemanari intre cele doua carti  deci se poate spune ca povestea nu e chiar originala  Mi se pare ca aceasta carte este   Fata disparuta  intr o versiune mai buna  Am citit o intr o singura zi  E genul acela de carte care te captiveaza cu totul si finalul nu e asa de usor de intuit ca la   Fata disparuta  M a dezamagit putin la final  totusi  pt ca s a terminat prea sec  brusc  dar mi a placut pentru felul in care e scrisa si te tine lipit de ea  4 5 starsTHAT WAS SO STRESSFUL  What an ending  I was wary of this book at first because of the hype surrounding it and after looking at some mixed reviews  I thought it would be an instance where readers not familiar with the thriller mystery genre overhyped a mediocre book  but I was wrong  This was a very well paced  well thought out and intense thriller  It wasn t the most original storyline and it kind of followed the thriller textbook  but it was well written and I was still caught by surprise by the ending  There were also a lot of dark elements intertwined into all of the character s backstories  Noone was exempt from a fucked up past  and I enjoyed that  Is that twisted  It s fiction  so no   I enjoyed uncovering all of their secrets and finding out that no one was perfect  no matter how they looked on the outside  I didn t figure out the culprit super early on  but I figured it out a tiny bit before the author actually revealed it  and it s been a long time since I ve had that moment of clarity in a book  I read the sentence  view spoiler   where Rachel is recalling the encounter under the bridge and she realizes it wasn t Anna getting into the car  hide spoiler   and it just clicked   I had to set the book down and just looked up like AH HA  It s always good fun when you read a bestseller that is currently receiving a lot of praise  and enjoy it immensely  Good job  Paula Hawkins   A tiding of magpies  One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl  four for a boy  five for silver  six for gold  seven for a secret never to be told  I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end  I wanted to be reading all of the time and that is the sign of a good book  Yes it does remind me somewhat of Gone Girl but I enjoyed this more  Dark and insightful  as a reader you re thrown right into the heads of each of the central characters  As the story unfolded I found myself sympathising with characters and appreciating that circumstances and others had played a part in shaping them and leading them to their current situations  I enjoyed the growing awareness they developed  not only of others  but of themselves  This book has twists aplenty and always left me wanting to find out what happened next  In most people s lives  there are what I call  familiars   These are the store clerks or baristas or subway travelers we see on a fairly regular basis  the somewhat familiar faces that show up in our existence time and again   people we think we may  kind of know   but who we do not really  know  at all  And in our heads  maybe we play this little game where we imagine what their lives might be like beyond the context of our acquaintance   Maybe Kent the toll taker has a young wife and three children at home and they live in a cramped tenement apartment with Kent s ailing mum   It s tempting to create a backstory and then convince ourselves that it is real  Or maybe we think that we can gauge a person s character by virtue of their looks or their demeanor   That waitress is always so pleasant to me   she must be a nice person  right    That guy at Starbuck s is so handsome  I ll bet his wife is a lucky woman   Which is probably why the neighbors of serial killers  when interviewed on television  always say  He seemed such a nice  quiet fellow  Always polite  always helpful  I can t believe he would ever do such a thing   We all think we know the familiars in our lives   but we don t really know them at all   The Girl on the Train  is arranged around that same premise  Part  Rear Window   part  Yellow Wallpaper  and part every mystery you have ever encountered that involves suspicious suburbanites  a missing woman  and unreliable witnesses  this book follows our main protagonist  Rachel  who has created a backstory for two of her  familiars    a couple who live in a home she sees from her train stop every day  Rachel witnesses something unusual in the lives of her familiars the day before the wife in that couple goes missing  and from there we are catapulted into a story where we are presented with a host of characters we begin to think we know   only to learn we do not really know them at all  I won t lay out the plot lines or divulge any spoilers here  This book is a great little character study that benefits most from its razor sharp economy of language  addressing all the dark layers of human existence with a very effective minimalism  and also succeeds due to its disturbingly simple premise that we never truly know what anyone around us is capable of doing at any given moment  we cannot imagine the inner lives  the internal struggles that those around us face beneath the facade of everyday platitudes  That lady down the street may be cheating on her husband or plotting revenge on a colleague or a clinically depressed addict just as easily as she may be a good samaritan or a devoted mother or a volunteer at the food bank  And she may even be all of these things at once  The capacity for others to be able to deceive us also depends on our capacity to deceive ourselves  There were a couple of minor issues I had with the book  but they did not detract much from my enjoyment of its quick prose and nasty little twists and turns  What bothered me most was Rachel herself  but that s actually a testament to the author  because Rachel is supposed to bother me  She is a troubled desperate woman  an alcoholic  obsessed with her ex husband and her old life  and truly her own worst enemy  In fact  I kind of wonder if the train imagery that persists in the book is also meant to represent the  train wreck  of a woman that Rachel has become  There were several moments in the book when Rachel would fall into another bad habit or desperately serial call someone  and I wanted to crawl into the pages and take the cell phone away from her or stop her from making some new boneheaded mistake  But Rachel has to be this way  for purposes of the storyline and for purposes of lulling us into yet another preconception  The only real stumbling point for me with this book was that I figured out the big reveal long before it happened  Very close to the beginning of the book  in fact  And that took a bit of the fun out of it  because I do like a book that can surprise me  and I would have liked to have been wrong  Many readers claimed not to have seen it coming  though  and I envy them that morsel of satisfaction  Somehow  even knowing did not diminish my enjoyment of the book or my compulsion to try to read as much of it in one sitting as possible  The untangling of the story s many deceptions and misconceptions  the realization of the true natures of their  familiars   is really a journey that the characters themselves have to take  a reveal that they ultimately have to uncover  whether we know where this train is going or not   lktb lHy z  ly jy z  hdh l m  ly ljwdrydz k fDl ktb Dmn fy    ljrym  w lGmwD t ty lrwy   ly lsn thlth ns trbThn lHky  w mkn wqw  l Hdth lm ykhd k mn ql  n lrwy

through the eyes of 3 women Rachel  megan and anna as it seems we don t always know the person close to us  reminded me more of a sj Watson book with the hidden memories which return over time as the books head in many twists and turns to a chilling finale  I had a hard time putting this book down  I was prepared to shirk all responsibilities to make sure that I finished it  Fortunately  I didn t have to and I finished it anyways I love a good murder story  after years of watching CSI and other crime shows  I relish in a chance to try to solve the case along side the character s  and to come up with as many theories as possible to see which is correct  The Girl on the Train was great because it made me second guess my theories and even though the truth was one of my theories  I was still surprised by the ending This is a good read for anyone looking for suspense  a reason to stay sober and be observant  or a reason to not obsess over other people s lives  I have to say I m pretty tired of reading reviewers saying they didn t find a single character likable  as if this somehow devalues a book  Would you like some ice cream with your fairy tale  As long as the characters are well written and the story holds together  as they definitely are and do in The Girl on the Train  heap all the evil shit and fucked up human beings on me you can  Besides  there is plenty of beauty in the book  although it s often nostalgic and not the convenient feel good type It is a complex story with if not always complex at least very human characters  Not a book that is easy to put into a single sentence  although for many it will inevitably begin with  It s kind of like Gone Girl     As a thriller  which to be fair I have limited experience with  it was a page turner to uncover what the hell happened  I was very much in sync with the puzzlement of the characters  The reveal was slow and I was literally saying  No fucking way  in disbelief  Good use of foreshadowing  which I picked up none of  mainly because of the complex way that the story is told  That could get too confusing for some  I suppose  I just took it in and kept going The characters reflect different ways of living a life rather well  Especially when my perspective started shifting towards the end  it became what I thought was a good exploration of gender roles  There was fairly little humour  but around the middle I couldn t help starting to laugh at the short indignant  righteous Anna chapters whether they were intended as such or not  Not a lot of jokes though  just some self denigrating ones that I can think of It wasn t a very emotional read  as I suppose thrillers often aren t  although Hawkins  writing is a little more aesthetic and the story more tragic than  say  Gillian Flynn s  see  I managed to hold off until the end   I still sympathized with most of the characters at certain points The ending was perhaps a little too fast and simple  Also slightly unbelievable as far as physique as described in the book goes  I was also hoping a character would redeem themselves in a different way  although that would have been fairly stereotypical as well  Still  resolving the story in a unique way would have been difficult  so I suppose a decent ending is better than a bad one   I can see why so many people have likened this book to Gone Girl  There is some psychological craziness going on as well as a cast of characters who really suck  And I mean that they all have major issues with about as much likability as a fat tick  Also like Gone Girl  total page turner If you haven t read it yet  I would say this would be a really great beach read  It s disturbing  but it won t be too heavy on the ol  cranium  This would easily have gotten five stars from me  great writing  and I really loved how Hawkins uses an unreliable and even unlikable narrator  all of the narrators are unreliable actually  and teases out more and more info as we read  so that the story peels like an onion as we go  As many readers have said  at a certain point the tension and suspense are at such a clip that you can t stop turning pages But the end  much as I LOVED that I didn t see the main plot twist coming  was less compelling and real to me than the rest  It was exciting  yes  but it felt like a big Hollywood showdown ending tacked onto what had been a very honest book  and while I couldn t predict anything about the plot as I read most of the book  by the end events felt rote to me  Still good  still a satisfying ending  but the rest was so exquisite I hoped for more  But I ll be reading more of her work  Hawkins does a LOT while seemingly telling a straightforward story  a very deep pool under its placid surface  A fabulous psychological thriller full of unreliable narrators and a murder mystery that may not have you guessing until the very end  but will still have you glued to each page as the truth is revealed  Recommend  Wow  No me lo esperaba  Me gusto aunque me molesta un poco lo mismo que en Gone girl me molesto MUCHISIMO  Lo largo que es el libro sin necesidad  Esta bien que ayuda a crear cierto suspenso pero ya tanto relleno es un poco absurdo  Por suerte no era tan aburrido de leer como gone girl  Esperemos que la peli este buena    This was a true page turner  I read this book quickly because I was trying to figure out all of the mysteries involved  Highly recommend  4 5 stars The is best thriller in this genre I ve read in a very long time      and refreshingly different in the way the suspense unfolds like a puzzle as we try to figure out the truth of the situation from the point of views of those with impaired perceptions of reality I really wasn t a fan of  Gone Girl   particularly the book s conclusion  However  despite the fact that  The Girl on the Train  has been compared to  Gone Girl   the only similarities I really see are the fact that they are both thrillers  they are both similar in prose style  and they both involve a  missing person  and domestic strife  However  the plot itself for me is quite different and the ultimate payoff was more satisfying Like a high speed train ride  this book is an enjoyable  fast paced thriller with plot twists galore  told from the perspective of three very human  very flawed women  who have to face issues such as depression  addiction  infidelity and other domestic strife  What interested me the most was Rachel s present tense perspective as a troubled alcoholic with blacked out episodes that she is trying to uncover while coming to grips with herself as well as the central crime here  The author does an amazing job bringing the alcoholic mind into the forefront while keeping me on the edge of my seat as I raced through this story  Ah  this was such an addictive read    Recommended This was the last book read that I needed to complete my yearly challenge and it was fantastically suspenseful  More so when you consider that it is the authors first thriller  Rachel is a hot mess  a shadow of her former shelf  Her husband has left her for another woman and they now have a child  a child Rachel wanted more than anything  Turning to drink  she has become an ugly drunk  lost her job  gained weight and doesn t remember what she has done  often blacking out She takes the same train  at the same time that she too when she has a job  not wanting anyone to know she has been fired  She has a good reason to look out the windows of the train and this is how she becomes embroiled in a turn of events that will have a huge impact on her life I felt a reluctant sympathy for Rachel  she is so totally flawed  seemingly unable to help herself  The suspense and the characters were amazingly portrayed  Often I had no idea what was going to happen next  things kept changing  going in a different direction  Reminded me somewhat of Alfred Hitchcock with his unique camera pans  only this author does the same thing but with words  I have train tracks about 50 yards behind my house but thank goodness it is only for freight  if it was passenger train I think I would be extremely self conscious about what I was doing in my yard Highly recommend for psychological and suspense thriller  readers Arc from librarything   A psychological thriller  this book will reel you in to its unraveling plot line and twists  and the characters  twisted  entertaining thoughts  4 0 Stars  I was glued to the page    You open the book and know in the first sentence that someone was murdered  The narrator is calm  un effected by what he she has done and logical  But we see the story though the eyes of Rachel  who rides the train to and from each day by a neighborhood she studies and watches   and imagines things about the people she watches  She goes as far as to name them  Then one day she sees something odd    But Rachel is not the most reliable witness and she has a pack of her own troubles  Does she step forward and say something or stay out of it  I was spellbound at the end  It was if I could see it being played out in a movie  How would this be fixed  How could it end and not end badly  Would there be justice or horror A really good novel    I can see the movie already  Worth the read  Talk about your unreliable narrators  and hard to sympathize with her  as well  But once I got a chapter or so in  however  I was well and truly hooked  and kept turning pages  finishing it within a day  The device of her drinking worked to keep the reader in suspense  while also making this reader want to march her to the nearest rehab facility   I am not a Mystery girl  but if you liked Gone Gone you will like this  I bought it because Paul Hawkins is from Harare     I did not like the characters in this book  I found Rachel frustratingly too realistic and pitiful  The mystery got to me though and suspense  This was a fun  crazy read for the summer where all the characters are flawed and kind of sad  especially the heroine  but it works for an entertaining page turner  whodunit  I think it got a thumbs up from everyone in my book club  Lots of wine flowed between the pages and at book club    My next door neighbour passed me a copy of this over the garden fence  Quite appropriate really as this psychological thriller takes places in London s outer suburbs and one wonders what the other occupants of Blenheim Road were doing while the events of this book were unfolding   lots of running into gardens screaming and despite the fact that an unsolved murder has taken place people seem to come and go without curtains twitching  I also found Rachel s situation a bit hard to swallow  despite her alcohol issues it seems odd that she would be left with not a brass farthing from her divorce while hubby and his new wife keeps house and furniture  Odd that neither her mum nor her friend Cathy suggested a good divorce lawyer  Those quibbles aside  I really enjoyed this  It is a page turner and Hawkins throws plenty of spoilers in to keep you guessing   although I did have a pretty good idea who the killer was  she did mix it up quite a bit and fed out the clues gradually  She also writes well   a spare style   all first person but 3 POVs  Even though the main character  Rachel  is a booze soaked wreck for most of the novel  puking on her flatmate s stairs  falling down in the street  pissing herself and slugging back an unhealthy mix of different drinks  I did find I quite liked her and felt sympathy for her  As the story progresses it becomes easier to root for her   even though she is her own worst enemy  What I particularly liked was the way the book unfolds with Rachel watching Blenheim Road from the carriage of a train  imagining the lives of the people she sees in one of the houses  How many of us have done exactly that as our trains are held up at a signal and we peer into the back gardens of terraced houses wondering about the lives of the occupants  A quick read  a bit of a psychological puzzle  Unlike other reviewers  Rachel s personality flaws made her more real and believable to me  I don t need to LIKE her to appreciate her  The author knit an interesting web of characters and relationships  and until the end I didn t know who the killer was  I think the story could have benefited from another layer and a few of the characters  Anna in particular  could have been more dimensional  It left me wishing for something more  thus I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars  But for a fun  weekend read  I recommend it   A minha opiniao em video   https   www youtube com watch v Y0tfl    I stayed up until 11 30 last night to finish this book  and that is saying something for me Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning  Every day she rattles down the track  flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes  and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck  She s even started to feel like she knows them   Jess and Jason   she calls them  Their life  as she sees it  is perfect  Not unlike the life she recently lost And then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough  Now everything s changed  Unable to keep it to herself  Rachel offers what she knows to the police  and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next  as well as in the lives of everyone involved  Has she done more harm than good A compulsively readable  emotionally immersive  Hitchcockian thriller that draws comparisons to Gone Girl  The Silent Wife  or Before I Go to Sleep  this is an electrifying debut embraced by readers across markets and categories   Brilliant 4 5Here we are 3 years after the release of Gone Girl  and every twisty turny page turning novel is STILL being compared  THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is no exception   but that was not what caught my attention  What persuaded me    Train   Witness to murder   Hitchcock   Rear Window  Those words will get me almost every time   Rachel is depressed  angry  and bitter  Gin and tonic  is her drink of choice  Wine comes in at a close second  Every day she takes the slow train from Asbury to Euston   and everyday it slows to a stop and she sees  Jason and Jess   The  perfect couple   A couple who just by watching them every day  gives her hope that happiness exists   Rachel is stuck clinging to the days she had with her ex husband Tom  who left because of her drinking   who left her for a younger woman  A younger version of her  drama free   and a woman who now has Tom s baby  A baby that Rachel could never give him    The only relief from her dreary  pointless  life is  Jess and Jason     not their real names of course    but very real for her all the same  Then one day Rachel witnesses something that doesn t seem right   something that involves a woman named Megan  the woman who she thought of as  Jess   And now Jess Megan is missing   So far this is my favorite book from this year  YES  it has a lot of hype surrounding it  but don t let that get in the way of picking it up   D I really didn t want to like this book  It s just so  insanely popular right now  I just wanted to be that person that could look down her nose and say something distasteful about its literary merits  Doesn t matter  I was so involved with each unreliable character and I absolutely loved every second of it  YESSSS Full review to come    eventually This was one of the few crime thriller books that I ve ever read  and it was amazing  I wonder if someone is making a movie based on it cuz it would be even better than Gone Girl I liked that in spite of being a thriller  the characters  specially Rachel  were skillfully developed and the emotional elements were very relatable  The plot was very interesting and the writing fluent  Overall  a very non cheesy ly entertaining book  excellent mystery  well laid out  and the clues were just enough to make it possible for everybody to have done it  Good to the end  Tom and Rachel  the drunk  Then Tom and Anna  the mistress he married and had a baby  Evie  Megan  the hot blond with a past seen and observed from the train  her husband Scott  the hot headed and loving broken hearted widow  and that mysterious man with the red hair  Then there is Kamal  the compromised shrink  Could have been anyone Loved the healing that takes place in the life of the  well portrayed alcoholic  and all of the doubts and self doubting that is part of the personality Well Done Thanks  Randee  Very well written   a page turner  The ending wasn t a complete surprise  but the writing kept me enthralled  Would definitely recommend this boook to mystery lovers  Rachel   the girl on the train  is an alcoholic who is still recovering from her two year old divorce  Travelling from home to work on a train  she recreates the perfectly happily married life and superimposes it onto the people she witnesses during the journey  However  this vicarious happiness proves to be shortlived in the wake of a mysterious disappearance  And Rachel feels she is the key to solving the mystery The book is about secrets and all the characters are hiding something  The result being  every character has the feeling of being watched in their own homes atlas one  While one secret after another unfolds  Rachel feels that she has the key to solving the mystery if only her memory would come back It isn t a very complex plot  but the beauty lies in its simplicity  The book has a pacy plot and not a single word would seem superfluous  One of the best reads of this year and certainly worth a read  This is Rachel s journey from being an  unreliable witness  to becoming a sober  calm and mature individual  Hawkins has a gift for drawing characters so heartbreakingly real that you ll be squirming in your seat  She also set the scene flawlessly and with great detail  The result was that for the first several chapters of the book  there s only subtle foreshadowing of the foul play to come  I started wondering   was this really a thriller  Or was the mystery something less immediately life and death and more a matter of personal discovery Then  all of a sudden  there it was  Except also there it wasn t  This book doesn t progress the way most thrillers do  Usually a thriller starts with a little bit of background or scene setting  followed by a description of the crime  and then you get to know the people in the victim s life as the author slowly teases out possible motives  This book was the other way around  It slowly wound itself around and up to the salient event  At which point Hawkins turned the entire story on its head It isn t at all like Gone Girl in terms of the specifics  but the feel of it was similar  The more you learn about these characters  the less you feel like you know them  And again  they become less and less likeable  I didn t dislike them anywhere near as much as the characters in Gone Girl  but my opinions of them definitely shifted as I read The plot itself was good   not great   but good  It went off in unexpected directions  there were red herrings  there was intrigue and lots of possible outcomes  For the first 3 4 of the book  you wouldn t know it s Hawkins  first novel  Her plot development is different  sure  but that s a good thing  I liked not knowing what to expect  and I lost myself in her words  I found that  though I was okay with the ending  there were bits towards the end of the book that struck me as a bit unrealistic  It was as if either the author tried too hard not to give anything away  or had planned one conclusion  changed her mind  and then went back and forced the pieces to fit in with a new one  There weren t quite enough bread crumbs along the way  and a little less foreshadowing than I would have liked  The ending still worked  but I would have preferred the scene being slightly better set for this particular outcome  I finished this book nearly a week ago  but it s still popping into my head  I find myself wondering how the characters got on after the book ended  what they d do next if the story continued  This is the sign of a good book  Though the thriller aspect was definitely good  the writing is what really stood out  It s rare to find such depth and beauty in a book centered primarily around suspense  let alone in a debut I m glad this book kicked off my reading for 2015  It reminded me what good writing feels like when you lose yourself in it  and left me feeling haunted and yet wanting more  Was it perfect  No  But I ll be first in line for Paula Hawkins  next book  because if this debut is anything to go by  she s one to watch Read the full review on BACKLIST BOOKS  Nice neo du Maurier This is a story told in three voices  Rachel  an active alcoholic   down on her luck  unemployed  unhappy  hopeful delusional  Megan  a housewife with problems  some more surprising than others  shall we say  and whose disappearance gives shape to the novel  Anna  a housewife and young mother with the kind of terrifying narrow vision you sometimes see in people with young children  although  to be fair  it certainly looks like Anna s had that narrowness and self absorption for some time  I really enjoy the Daphne du Maurie novel My Cousin Rachel  which  if you haven t read it or seen the film adaptation  with Olivia de Havilland and Richard Burton   I won t spoil for you  But  I was reminded  reading The Girl on the Train of that book  because there are so many marriages and failed marriages   and because there are so many houses to be taken over  or stubbornly resisted  And because at the center of the novel is a mystery about a woman  about how good that woman is and how trustworthy But this is also a bit like Rebecca  because if you can t trust the women in The Girl on the Train  you sure as shit can t trust the men  And like Gaslight   I recommend the 1940 film  by the way  because although I think it it less polished than the 1944 adaptation  Anton Walbrook is much scarier than Charles Boyer  That s not quite what you d expect  either  I liked this so much more than Gone Girl  Partly for a couple of totally unfair reasons like  probably  I like British writers more than Americans  I think  actually  that s not true  but I ve never done the math  and that TGOTT just came out and I read GG like three years after it was published  And that s always a weird thing to do   read this novel everyone was really into like three years ago        But REALLY  the reason I like Hawkins  book so much   I should say  though  it almost lost me a few times because I am very susceptible to second hand embarrassment   is that it doesn t explain its themes or ideas to you the way that GG does  I know that is part of the conceit of the characters  that they are  cleverer than everyone else  and so they re condescending to explain  like  gender dynamics and gender performance  But Rachel  for example  is a total mystery to herself  And she spends her narrative  mostly  wrapped up in the experience of being herself  and lamenting it   not analyzing or explaining it  When she goes to a therapist  then  she tells us things we know or have gleaned  but there is something really welcome and wonderful about her speaking those things to someone else  to someone who can answer  And Anna is like Lucy Steele or something   a monster of self absorption and self deception I don t know if Hawkins was thinking about du Maurier when she wrote this  probably not   I don t think people evoke her as a model right now  But I would be really happy to read more books in the du Maurier tradition  Are there more on the way  Well well   as I began this book which everyone was reading   I thought perhaps I had lost my mind  I couldn t keep up with the different dates   voices   and jibber jabber  In fact I started to put it in the recycle bin then after about 5 or 6 chapters I finally realized this was Ms Hawkins exasperating style  She meant to keep us guessing as she ran us through false alleys   confused us with suspects  amnesia albeit drunk main characters   I thought this was a rehash of Gone Girl    but wa la I liked it once I caught on to the characters and the trip the author was taking me on  The author although not as good as Gone Girl is surely unique in the story telling and she keeps us on our toes as we seek clues and try and figure this mind bender out    what a storyteller  omg I got this book from Audible and listened to the audiobook over a period of a week  It was an incredible experience for someone who is a newbie to Audiobooks Rachel is a divorcee  who travels by the same train every day  As she passes by her old home  she soon becomes enamored by a couple living down a couple of houses  To her  they seem like the perfect couple who are in love with each other  But one day she sees the girl with another man and soon after the girl goes missing  When Rachel gets the news  she feels like she needs to help find the girl  She tells the police what she knows  but they do not take her seriously  That s when Rachel decides to take some action on her own and the story starts to unfold This is such an awesome and horrifying novel  Each and every character in it  much like real life  is flawed  There were moments when I felt like shaking a character till she saw sense and then there were moments where I was too horrified  Rachel  the narrator  is so unreliable because of her drinking habits that half the time I was left wondering if she had been hallucinating about some of the things  She came off all wrong at the beginning and I couldn t figure out why the author would put her in the forefront of the novel  It took me sometime and it was way past the first half of the story that I managed to warm up to her It took me some time to really get the hang of the story  not necessarily because of the writing but mostly because I am yet to get used to listening to audiobooks  but once I got into it  I could hardly stop listening   Unfortunately real life does seem to get in the way as does the lure of print books   The language used is opulent and the narration style that gives us the story from three POVs is really interesting  The plot was really engrossing  The mystery had me going back on forth on who the murderer could be  Some of the red herrings really had me going in circles and the climax was worth all the buildup The narrators   Louise Brealey  Clare Corbett and India Fisher   have done a great job in bringing the characters alive  I am still not sure about who narrated which character  but they were a perfect fit  It was almost like I could feel the characters and their emotions through their narration Awesome  Was a fun read  I looked forward to picking it up to read every day  A bit like a drunk Bridget Jones  Rachel made many decisions that made me cringe  but it is a very forward moving novel and kept me interested  I can see this story as a movie  So I just finished this book in little more than a day and I have to say   what a journey The storytelling is shared by four girls  all of whom perceive facts and events in a different light and while reading one quickly notices that no one storyteller can be trusted to tell the whole story I personally also enjoyed the imagery of Rachel  one of the narrators who s an alcoholic and lost her job while still fake commuting into the city everyday switches from observer on the train to an acting persona and vice versa  I actually also recognized a lot of myself in this book  isn t it true that we all sometimes think we know somebody just by seeing them regularly  having developed a sophisticated image in our mind that we struggle to fit to the actual person once we learn some detail that doesn t quite fit the picture  Don t all of us sometimes have a tendency to go overboard a little  letting one white lie lead to another to cover an awkward truth The plot itself was also quite well narrated  although for me the special magic of this book lay in its way of telling the story  The plot had some slight leaps that made me reconsider my 5 star rating and settling for a comfortable 4 star   not a life changer  but would definitely read again and recommend  After reading many favorable comparisons between this book and the tension of a fine Hitchcock movie  I had to put this one on my reading list  If there is a Hitchcock comparison  it is probably closer to SHADOW OF A DOUBT or STRANGERS ON A TRAIN  Also  instead of a blissfully innocent central character who is caught up in sinister doings  we have a deeply flawed central character who keeps putting herself in harm s way That s not a negative  although there are some  Aw  c mon   moments  Mostly  this is a brisk read with interesting characters and a number of plot twists that would keep the popcorn munchers happy if the story was filmed Who did it  In all honesty  I believe that most mystery fans will have a very good idea by midway through the book  What will be less obvious  but not too difficult to solve  is why it was done  and part of the fun is piecing together the logic behind the events One device that I found to be distracting was giving different characters separate chapter headings and then following the story from their unique point of view  As we near the ending  events are happening quickly and the trade off between character narrations   while not stopping the action   does require a momentary reorientation  I would have found a more linear method of storytelling more to my liking  especially as I m not a big fan of flashbacks   and there are a lot of flashbacks in this tale All of that said  the type of person who goes to see a Hitchcock thriller is not expecting a P D  James depth of analysis and development  If you like your mystery thrillers brisk and exciting  you should enjoy this one  One of my favorite thrill novels so far  I had so many theories about the killer and I was mind blown at the end  it s not that often that a book draws you in from the first chapter and you can t put it down  yes the characters are dark and disturbed   which only adds to the aura  the author really developed the characters well because I couldn t stand Rachel s weakness  the reader is only allowed to see her from one person s perspective  then we are given a broader view like a zoomed lens retracting and showing us the bigger picture  really well crafted piece of fiction   Und wie kamen sie in den Garten    Ich bin uber den Zaun gestiegen  Ich wusste ja  wie man in den Garten kommt      Sie sind also uber den Zaun geklettert  um sich Zutritt zum Haus ihres Exmanns zu verschaffen   Alles beginnt damit das wir mit Rachel Zug fahren  sie hat ihre festen Zeiten und immer die gleiche Bahnstrecke die sie immer fahrt  Jeden Tag einmal fruh und dann abends wieder zuruck  manchmal bleibt der Zug stehen und sie kann einen Blick auf ein Paar in einem der Hauser am Bahngleis  werfen  Sie hat ihnen langst Namen gegeben und ihnen eine eigene Geschichte angedichtet Zu Beginn merken wir auch gleich was mit Rachel los ist  sie ist schwer Alkoholsuchtig und manchmal wirkt es so als konne sie das was tatsachlich passiert nicht mehr mit ihren Vorstellungen auseinanderhalten  Ganz ehrlich  bei Rachel dauerte es ein wenig bis ich sie leiden konnte  Sie ist eher die untypische Romanheldin  sehr oft betrunken  lasst sich gehen und wie soll ich sagen  sie gilt als Versagerin  Doch je mehr wir von ihr lesen desto mehr lernen wir sie kennen und verstehen  Erst nach und nach wird ihr Handlen klar  Ich wurde leider nicht richtig mit ihr warm  aber sie wurde mir sympathischer Aber auch die anderen Charaktere sind nicht ohne  da ware Megan die ein nach aussen hin perfektes Leben zu fuhren scheint  doch auch hier ist es mehr Schein als sein  Sie hat Schlafstorungen und leidet unter einer Art Trauma  Auch ihre Personlichkeit hat mich etwas verwundert  sie wirkte nicht wie das brave Madel von nebenan Weiter geht es mit Anna  der Frau von Rachels Ex Tom  Sie scheint ein Bilderbuch Famlienleben zu haben  und leidet unter Rachels standigen Anrufen  Ihr Mann Tom nimmt das eher gelassen  Immer wieder versucht er Rachel zu beschwichtigen  So richtig durchsetzen kann sich Anna nicht und uberhaupt wirkte sie die ganze Zeit eher inaktiv und nicht besonders stark Es tauchen noch weitere Charaktere auf wie Andy und Scott die geschickt in die Handlung eingewoben wurden  Bei beiden hatte ich mir jedoch gewunscht das noch ein wenig mehr auf sie eingegangen wurde  Ebenso der Therapeut  der auch eine Rolle zu spielen hatte Was mir personlich gut gefallen hat war das die Handlung aus Rachel  Anna und Megans jeweiligen Sichtweisen gezeigt wurden und so der Handlung Spannung und Dichte verliehen haben  Am Buchanfang war die Handlung noch eine langsame Reise die dann immer mehr an Fahrt aufgenommen hat  Man konnte prima mitratseln und ich muss sagen  ich habe den wahren Tater nicht erkannt Zum Schreibstil kann ich nur soviel sagen  das Buch liest sich leicht und flussig und die gekonnten Wendungen haben der Handlung viel Spannung verliehen  Die Zugfahrt war gut beschrieben  man fuhlte sich immer wie einer der Passagiere Wer Spannung und eine gut entwickelte Handlung sucht der kann bei Girl on the Train beherzt zugreifen  Das es nicht gleich offensichtlich war wer den nun der Tater war hat mir sehr gefallen  Weniger toll fand ich die standigen Alkoholszenen weswegen ich dem Buch einen Punkt abziehe Das fand ich zwar menschlich aber nicht schon In einem Satz  Spannender Thriller mit einer etwas anderen HeldinGirl on the Train erhalt 4 von 5 Sternen I really enjoyed this book  If my family hadn t been visiting I probably would have read it in one day because the suspense was killing me  Once you get about halfway through the book the ending becomes pretty apparent but I didn t enjoy it any less I enjoyed this read  there was a point where I felt like the book was repeating itself and I was just rereading previous chapters  although  once I passed that point it was gripping and exciting  I couldn t put it down  and the ending was great  Couldn t put this one down  The main character is a flawed and broken woman with an obsession who tries to unravel a mystery  Loved it  My kind of book  Flawed characters  suspense and a little action  A page turner that I really enjoyed   This is not horror  but it is perhaps the most terrifyingly claustrophobic books I have ever read  Something bad has happened  something bad is going to happen  The Girl on the Train of the title is a witness to   something   but she is also an alcoholic  a binge drinker subject to blackouts  She can t remember quite what she s seen  she can t remember what she s done  but she knows it s bad  and no one will believe her because no one believes a drunk  a rubbernecker  a failure  This book is a testament to people making choices and the legacy of those choices  The drama  the suspense  of this book revolves around whether the characters can right those choices in time to save themselves  Readers will root for these flawed but believable characters with baited breath   I have a lot of feelings  but I think if I would stop reading books that are really similar to this  I wouldn t be as hard on it  So I ll pretend like I haven t and give it a 4 instead of the 3 I would normally  I also want a book that doesn t let me know what s going on till the very end  There was one  tiny  tiny  m  night twist that also pushed it over the edge  but I did figure it out a little too soon  This book read like an express train for me  but I still feel torn about how to rate it  I absolutely enjoyed the experience of reading it and could hardly put it down  I admire the way the story is structured  not just weaving three POV characters  three unlike able ones at that   and two timelines into a coherent narrative  but also the way information is concealed and revealed  it s impressive and seems like it would be incredibly challenging for an author to keep straight  But I did guess at the basic conclusion well before the end  there are really only so many possibilities  and so the ending maybe didn t have the impact it should have  For all the aspects I can admire about the book  I still felt a bit disappointed upon finishing  I think that s because the reading experience was one of pure entertainment  rather than one of insight  emotional resonance  and meaning  But probably one doesn t really read thrillers for that kind of experience  right  Great quick read   slightly choppy with the timelines in the beginning but not a problem  As the story unfolded I couldn t put it down and the ending took me slightly by surprise  As soon as I finished  Two Black Cadillacs popped in my head  Thumbs up   An amazingly gripping thriller that keeps the readers glued to the plot guessing right to the last page in spite of having enough scattered clues  I m impressed with it s lucid manner of narratives how the whole story gets it s shape surrounding the day to day activities of a female protagonist  I m not sure whether it can perfectly be called a psychological thriller  my experience with this genre is very limited  but this is simply an un put down able thriller with lots of violence  blood shedings  jealousy  betrayal  love  depression  alcohol  murder and what not  Overall  this is a pretty much appreciative work considering the fact that it s the first novel by this author  I mean authoress   and I m looking forward for much more page turners like this from Paula Hawkins  Un roman captivant  pe care cu greu il lasi din mana  O calatorie cu trenul    care pare fara sfarsit  D   Viata nu e un paragraf si moartea nu e ceva intre paranteze  http   palarisme ro chef carti 72 car    I literally couldn t leave it aside when I reached the last 100 pages It was so well written and everyone seemed suspect  I didn t even know what to think  I mean I had a hunch ever since the beginning  and it turned out I was right  but I did question it a lot of times I loved that Rachel wasn t the kind of girl you root for or you completely love  but a normal person with flaws  and a lot of them  Anna was such an annoying character  she had zero self esteem  and she was so cruel and heartless  I hated her  A ripping good read that I drank down in 24 hours  A bit too much weeping and lamenting for my taste  but I was hooked from the beginning  Any book that can do that gets 4 stars from me  My taste in books tends to lean toward the darkly fantastical kind  This was reinforced the other day when a woman came into the library looking for a  light read about women  family  and relationships   and I struggled to think of something that wasn t about a psychological murderer  punk rock  or supernatural happenings  In the end  I did find something  Nothing I ve read  though it was highly recommended by the general public and Kirkus   Essentially  I love it when plots are messy and filled with imperfect characters Well  The Girl on the Train has all of these things  including three delightfully unreliable narrators  Rachel  a divorced alcoholic who cannot seem to let go of her past life  Megan  a woman in an unhappy marriage who has an affair with her therapist  and Anna  the woman who stole Rachel s husband  The story spills out at an even pace  which practically forces you to keep reading  Is it the next Gone Girl  Maybe  I have wanted to read this book since it was released and was ecstatic when my boyfriend bought it for me  I enjoyed the twists and turns and how you get pulled into each characters lives and start to really feel their emotions  I was expecting more from this book when I read about it but I still think that it had the right amount of romance  thriller and drama in there to keep you reading and not once make you think  like hell that would happen   I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a bit of thrill and mystery   The period in which it took for me to read this book in no way reflects what I thought of it  I just have no spare time to read full chapters at once however annoying that may be   Rachel s train stops in front of the same house every day on her morning commute  and she feels almost as if she knows the couple who lives there  When she spots another man in the garden  then the woman goes missing Rachel feels the need to get involved in a potentially dangerous situation  The story is heightened by Rachel s lack of reliability as a narrator  and murder  lies  deceit  infidelity come into play from many characters I needed a break from AY novels  so I chose this newer title  I LOVED IT  I love how unreliable Rachel is and how the story not only changes points of view but also does not follow a completely linear time table  If you enjoy books about deception  jealousy  and mystery with a touch of unstable characters  this one is for you  I would not suggest this book to young readers but would put it in the hands of many of my adult friends who read and loved Gone Girl  Here s the thing  Gillian Flynn cannot write books as fast as I can read them  When something pops up as the next  Gone Girl  and the reviews start rolling in saying it actually could be  my interest explodes  Entertainment Weekly has said that there is a whole slew of books coming out this year in this vein and I truly can t wait to read them all  Like Flynn s novels  The Girl on The Train is full of really depressing and unlikable characters  which makes it even more intense when you get to that inevitable point in these type of stories when you have to choose which side you want to take and who you want to believe  I m obviously not going to talk about the twists and turns  of which there are many  or the fact that had I slowed down a bit and not read this in a day I might have seen the big reveal coming  In all honesty though  I wasn t even trying to figure it out  I was along for the ride  And what a fast and thrilling ride it was   I thought that this book started out really slow   there were times that I wasn t sure that I was going to be able to finish it  however  after the first 180 pages or so it picked up and was much easier to read  I enjoyed the ending of the book much more than the beginning of it or even the middle of it  It did keep me guessing who had done it   and I was a bit surprised by the outcome  however  this book was a bit over rated by the media and was a let down on that front  It has been repeatedly compared to Gone Girl and to be honest I never once thought of Gone Girl while reading it  An ok   book but wait for paperback or the library to get it in  My No Spoiler Review Does this deserve the comparison to Gone Girl  Yes  Yes it does  However  it deserves the comparison not because the plots are alike  I would argue they are quite different  but rather  because this was a fun  quick romp of a psychological thriller  Just like Gone Girl Honestly  I guessed what the twist was going to be around page 94  I marked my place there out of curiosity to see if I was correct   However  Even guessing the twist made this no less enjoyable of a read and I still zipped right through to get to the end  knowing the twist does not mean you will guess the ending   Even better  The twist is NOT contrived and the author did not throw it in there out of the blue  The author alludes to the twist throughout the book and she does it quite well Such a fun  yummy read that I could hardly put down  And bonus    we have not one  not two  but THREE narrators    and it is up to the reader to determine who is reliable  Delicious  Oh  this was a good read  We picked it for our book club because pretty much all of us had added it to our  to read  lists  though I probably would have read it anyway  It was super readable  compelling and with enough mystery to keep those pages turning  It s funny  because while I was reading it  I thought it was all believable and very clever  but in retrospect  some of it kind of had me scratching my head  and feeling a little bit tricked  which is kind of sucky  It made for a great read  but some of the  big reveals  seem like they would be impossible Because this book would be kind of a bummer to read if you know what happens  I m hiding the rest  Consider yourself warned  view spoiler  All the comparisons to Gone Girl are fair   it s similarly readable and the narrator is not very reliable  And I think because I had heard those comparisons so much  I was deeply suspicious of everyone  and what everyone said  The one person I wasn t suspicious of was Tom  the husband  the guy who ended up being the bad guy  And that  I think  is pretty impressive  though in retrospect it was largely because of some rather implausible situations  namely  why did he only beat up Rachel when she was black out drunk  And how did he know she was black out drunk  That is just weird  It seems like abusers wouldn t wait until that was the situation to be abusive  though I guess maybe was more like a psycho sociopath type rather than a typical abusive husband  But  I don t know  it seems like a stretch to me  This was kind of a sub problem of the broader one  all the red herrings  Red herrings are part of mysteries  and I know that  but in this case  a lot of them didn t otherwise get explained  Why on earth did Scott lock Rachel in that room  Why was he so controlling and weird with Megan  What was the deal with the creepy therapist  They didn t necessarily add anything to the plot  other than to thicken it  and again  it made me feel a little bit cheated  Or tricked  That s not the satisfying experience of  AH HA  that often comes from a really well constructed mystery Rachel was a really interesting narrator  I m not sure I ve ever read a book where alcoholism is so much a part of the main character s daily life  and when it is treated as the relentless  desperate  depressing condition that it really is  There was no romanticizing  and it was incredibly frustrating to read about Rachel continually slipping One major complaint was the horrific scene with Megan and her dead baby  I don t know why that was necessary or how it added to the story  It was just horrific  and awful On the other hand  I thought the terrifying scene of Rachel snatching up Anna s baby was powerful and frightening  and even when Rachel sort of explained it  it was never very satisfying  and made me realise just how unstable she really was  I thought that was very effective storytelling Anyway  four stars because WHILE I was reading it  I was really immersed  It was only in retrospect that I felt a little misled   hide spoiler   Det har var en annorlunda lasupplevelse som kanske inte riktigt ar en fyra  men nara nog i alla fall  Huvudpersonen Rachel ar ingen hjaltinna som man ser upp till eller onskar vara  for hon ar alkoholiserad  ljuger bade for sig sjalv och for andra och lever ett liv som hon vet kan falla ihop nar som helst  Hon bor pa nader hemma hos en inte sarskilt nara bekant  aker ivag med pendeltaget varje morgon till ett jobb hon blivit kickad fran for flera manader sedan och oppnar en flaska vin eller en burk gin och tonic ibland redan pa morgonen  En av Rachels stora nojen ar att titta pa husen som passerar utanfor tagfonstret och det ar framst ett par som fangar hennes intresse  Hon doper dem till namn hon tycker passar  ger dem intressanta yrken och komplexa personligheter  Dessutom ar hon saker pa att de ar mycket lyckliga och alskar varandra over allt annat  Darfor kommer det som en chock nar hon en dag ser mannen i huset vara valdsam och nagon dag senare ser hon kvinnan med en annan man  Nar tidningen sedan rapporterar kvinnan forsvunnen vill Rachel hjalpa till  men vem skulle lyssna pa henne  en alkoholiserad fluktare som har svart att halla isar sina egna tankar  Inte blir det lattare nar paret som ar foremal for utredningen bor bara nagra hus fran Rachels ex make och som Rachel ringer och trakasserar nar hon ar full  Berattelsen formedlas genom tre olika kvinnors syn pa handelseforloppet som foljer  Rachel  Anna  ex makens nya fru  och Meghan  kvinnan som forsvinner   Upplosningen ar ovantad och ingenting ar som det verkar   This was a book club selection for me this month  I ll be honest I wasn t exactly all that excited about it  I was procrastinating big time on starting it   I m really making this sound appealing aren t I   Occasionally I like to listen to audio books so I figured I d see how this one was in audio  That way I could still read other things since I usually only listen to audio at my day job or while driving sans kiddos in the car  So I queued it up and started  I went into the book totally cold  I hadn t read any other reviews or even the blurb  I highly recommend doing this  Don t even research or read the back of the book  Just start it       http   straightshootinbookreviews com    This is the most gripping thriller that I have ever read  no doubt about it  The story is narrated by three Women  Rachel  who is drunk half the time and She s not always understandable or trustworthy which is what happens when you are drunk  and have memory lapses  Megan and Anna  the other two Women are not the type I  or just about anyone I know would want for friends  The three narrators will keep you guessing as you try to figure out who s behind one character s disappearance  I m sure that this novel will be adapted for the big screen sometime next year  You must read this book   This book is an unforgettable thriller  Great character development  great pacing  great story  It s definitely one that gets devoured in a matter of days  There s some coarse language  but all in all a thrilling read  Priznaius  srazu  chto pro etu knigu ia uznala

that the internal narrator of all the women was identical  I refuse to believe that we all have the same type of internal monologue day in and day out  It doesn t make sense  Von Anfang an hat mich das Buch gefesselt und ich musste mich teilweise zwingen  es aus der Hand zu legen  Ich fand es nur Schade  dass ab der Halfte das Ende recht leicht vorausschaubar war und somit war es weniger die Spannung als eher der Gedanke  Ich muss jetzt wissen  ob am Ende noch etwas Unerwartetes passiert   der mich bei der Stange gehalten hat  Daher war ich leider auch vom Ende enttauscht  denn bis zur letzten Seite dachte ich noch  dass was passieren wurde  was ich nicht erwartet hatte  Kam aber nicht  Trotzdem  super spannend geschrieben und ich mochte den schnellen Perspektiven Wechsel und die Ausarbeitung der Charaktere   Kept me turing the pages and wanting to know what happens next  Great book  Super intense  Felt very Gone Girl ey  but I read it in about a day   Rachel  an unemployed alcoholic  travels the same route on the train everyday  passing by her old house which her ex husband Tom now shares with his new wife Anna and their daughter Evie  A few houses down  Rachel watches a beautiful couple she imagines to have the perfect life until one day  she sees the perfect wife kissing another man  When she finds out the wife has gone missing  she can t help but become involved in the investigation The Girl on the Train is a quick read  suspenseful and engaging  it kept me up late several nights just wanting to find out what happened next  The novel is well paced  and very effective in its twists and reveals  with writing which prioritizes voice and plot over prose  which is typical of this type of thriller  And while I did find the prose lacking in a certain elegance  it was engaging and easy to follow Told in first person  the story jumps timeframes and narrators  and within the chapters  is broken up by date and by time of day  morning for the morning commute  and evening for the evening commute  While this structure works well to start  highlighting the limited nature of the narrator s perspective  the gimmick becomes a bit clunky to adhere to as the narrative moves beyond what Rachel observes from the train  Ultimately  Hawkins  writing displays a deep tenderness towards her flawed protagonist  forcing Rachel further into her own faults in order to finally find redemption  and the novel finds a satisfying ending for both the mystery of the wife s disappearance  and Rachel s own involvement in the case  This book was recommended reading in Overdrive when I was searching for Elizabeth Berg  I like that it changes narrators each chapter  That s a format I really enjoy  It was more of a mystery novel than I expected  There were a lot of twists and turns in the plot  Even though it wasn t what I expected  I had a hard time putting it down   I was wary of this book  or rather I was wary of the hype surrounding it  After the disastrous Apple Tree Yard  separate review on my blog  which I looked forward to but found hugely disappointing  I bore no expectations for The Girl On The Train  infact  if I m honest  was probably ready to dislike it The book has at its heart three female characters The main protagonist is Rachel  whose life is at an all time low  Her marriage has broken down  she has lost her job  she is very lonely and to compensate she drinks  heavily I really empathised with Rachel  I am sure a lot of people will see her as weak and foolish but to me she just came across as human  flawed but with a good heart Next there is Megan  who also has had a troubled life but has now found happiness with husband Scott   or so Rachel thinks Then there is Anna  who is the Goldilocks in Rachel s life  She lives in her house  sleeps in her bed and no doubt eats porridge in her kitchen  All with her ex husband and the baby daughter they have had together Rachel travels into London everyday on the train  The train stops regularly at a set of signals and she gets used to seeing a couple on their terrace  She makes up blissful lives for them  giving them names  Jason and Jess  and careers  She looks on enviously until one day she sees something that casts everything into doubt  Rachel feels that she needs to help out  it gives her life some purpose  but also leads to trouble It is difficult to say anymore without giving the plot away So does the book live up to the hype  For me  a big fat yes  Paula Hawkins has written a compelling  suspenseful book in which I thought the characters were very human  It makes you look at relationships and realise sometimes nothing is what it seems and people really do weave tangled webs for themselves  I thoroughly enjoyed it and will look forward to future books from this author      A page turner     Wow  Highly recommend   La inceput am fost toata numai zambete cand am pus mana pe un PDF al acestei carti  O voiam cu disperare in format printat  timpul insa a fost impotriva mea si n am apucat sa dau pe la o librarie  iar toate site urile de carti n o mai aveau in stoc  Acum ca ma gandesc mai bine nu cred ca as mai procura o  Cartea a fost  buna  recunosc  am citit o in doua zile  Mi se parea intrigant titlul  ideea unei necunoscute care studiaza persoane din tren  fata misterioasa care nu iese niciodata la lumina  Cred ca totusi am avut prea multe asteptari  Recunosc  am adorat felul in care a fost scrisa  Un stil simplu  clar  concis  Dar prea din scurt pentru mine  Pe la jumatatea cartii mi am dat deja seama cine a fost de fapt autorul teribilei disparitii a lui  Jess   iar de la o carte care se incadreaza in aria  mister thriller  nu m a prea tinut in priza  Speram ca la final sa raman cu un mind blow de zile mari  care sa ma faca sa ma gandesc la sensul vietii si la    nu stiu  orice  Insa nu mi au ramas prea multe  Speram tot timpul ca personajul principal sa faca ceva mai MARE  sa intoarca situatia pe toate partile si sa descopere ceva magnific  Insa ea doar s a afundat in alcool si depresia caracteristica care a cam lasat de dorit  Sincer am gasit mai mult mister in carti de dragoste absolut banale  motiv pentru care de la mine primeste 4 cu indulgenta   I agree with others that  in the post Gone Girl era  this book has the most similar tone to Gone Girl that I have come across  That being said  I didn t necessarily feel that it was trying to be the next Gone Girl either  The characters  while not likable for the most part  were also not always downright despicable either  Rachel  whose narration we see the most  is damaged  She s not a bad person  but she is an emotionally damaged alcoholic  which leads her to make poor choices  Even Megan does the things that she does because she is scarred from her past  and trying to run away from things that have hurt her  I think it helps to be able to feel some sympathy for at least some of the characters in a book  and I did here The book offered intrigue as the reader tries to piece together the mystery  and wonder about the black hole in Rachel s memory and what it means  It kept me interested  and I did read most of the book in one sitting  something I haven t done in a long time    A Bumpy Ride  My head leaning against the carriage window  I watch these houses roll past me like a tracking shot in a film  I see them as others do not  even their owners probably don t see them from this perspective  Twice a day  I am offered a view into other lives  just for a moment   The Girl on the Train is a novel  written by Paula Hawkins in the form of diary entries from three women s points of view  It is an interesting read that is directed for older readers  In my opinion  the main issues and emotions that that place in this novel are hard to relate to as a young reader because teens or even some people in their twenties are not exposed to these problems  Issues such as divorce  addiction  withdrawal  and denial are  for the most part  harder concepts for most teens and young readers to understand and relate to  The book was enticing in its plot  but due to age and experience issues with young readers  probably a better fit for older readers who can relate more to the book s content  In The Girl on the Train  Rachel  a now divorced and unemployed alcoholic rides the train past her old home near the tracks every day  She sees the old home she loved before the divorce and envies her ex husband s new wife and their successful family that she longed for before the divorce  She sometimes calls up her ex husband  Tom  or stops by the house  which scars Tom s new wife  Anna  Rachel also sees a young couple a few doors down  whom she has never met but imagines as the perfects couple  She thinks up each of their backstories and some scenarios in her mind that she thinks happens in their everyday lives  When there is a murder in the neighborhood  Rachel becomes interested and involved  She wants to find out everything she can about the night of the murder  but has to put the pieces of information she gathers together about that night like a puzzle because that night she was drunk and woke up at home with bruises and scars and no recollection of the night before  She will not stop until she finds out exactly what happened  and once she does  she learns more about her own past than she could ever have imagined  Some criticisms about the book would be how the diary entries can sometimes become confusing  because they jump back and forth between times  For example  the person who was murdered was already dead  however  all of a sudden an entry would come up written by her a month earlier  Another argument is that it isn t as relatable to young readers  The date issue can be resolved by using context clues and by paying close attention to diary entry dates so this isn t that bad of an issue  however  the age issue isn t as easy to fix  If a reader is mature the book can be entertaining and give people insight on some behavioral trends in different types of people  but if anything a reader can wait a few years to read it at a time when they can connect with the struggles it contains better  One of the positive things is that the time is set in the year 2013  so recent items and concepts make the book more relatable for readers too   Overall the book was interesting and had some unthinkable plot twists  It wasn t super predictable and it brought up real life issues that people around the world face  It could be really relatable to most audiences and enticing to all  The issues of alcoholism  murder  withdrawal  and denial make the book feel more real and relatable as well  This book showed both the dark and the light sides of things and proved that not everything is exactly as it seems  I found this book very thrilling to read  I absolutely love the way the story is told from the  highly  subjective viewpoints of three women and we don t really know how reliable any of them are  It seemed very well thought out psychologically and I found myself liking and disliking all three of them at the same time  I did not like the last 2 3 chapters all that much and found the ending very predictable and cliched    though that is both disappointing as well as good since  at least to me  it made sense  I don t like many thrillers  or crime  stories because they are either way too predictable or the ending is just completely unreasonable  and thus unpredictable   This one is more about the development of the three main female characters and that made the story very enjoyable even though the ending could have been resolved better  Be advised though that it does contain some scenes that I found very hard to stomach    not for their gruesomeness  but just for what happened  and because it does happen and it s not some insane silly thriller plot   Also  I ve heard of this book being compared to Gone Girl a lot and I can t see any reason for this comparison  The books have nothing in common and this one is far superior to Gone Girl in my opinion  Phew   After 7 hours  I finally finished this book Coming to the Story  Though it was a bit draggy and lengthy  The narration was above par and it made the Murky story interesting to read  By Murky i meant  this story was kind of similar to  Gone Girl  and It was full of  Affairs    Affairs    Affairs    I don t usually read books of this genre but this one din t really let me down  It was new to me and As i said  It had shades of  Gone Girl and overall  It was an interesting read but a Lengthy one    I liked this one  Maybe I m not very sharp but I definitely did not see this one coming  I certainly wish Ms  Hawkins had developed some of the characters a little more  I personally loved how I didn t side with the protagonist all the time  I just wanted to shake her up sometimes  Definitely worth reading  I couldn t stop  I almost left work early one day to get back to the book  Well  it was a good read  but I pretty much figured out the story by page 42  Still  I read it because I had to know what happened and how  An interesting mystery in the vein of Gone Girl and Memento  Maybe I d have preferred a few less clues so that the culprit would have remained a mystery for longer  but all in all the story was good  I don t think I liked a single one of the characters  but they definitely conformed to my cynical view of human nature  The insight into an alcoholics mindset was very believable  All in all  this was a well written and interesting mystery  if not exactly mindblowing  Definitely worth the read  It took me a little while to get into this novel  as initially I was irritated by the structure  The story is told in the first person by three female narrators  not equally balanced  but all distinct voices   In addition to that it s not linear   so I found myself constantly referring back a few pages to see who was speaking and when However  once I was about a third of the way in  it became easier to follow and I was riveted by the story and constantly questioning who could be trusted   not only doubting the reliability of all three narrators  but also questioning their judgements of the men in the case  A fascinating  morally complex story and well worth the initial difficulty   Just finished this last night and really did find it to be a page turner  No really likeable characters  except maybe Scott and Cathy  although her enabling of Rachel was really at epic proportions  The book is about Rachel  who rides the trains  not to get anywhere in particular but more to maintain a sense of normality and to avoid questions from Cathy  As you find out within just a few pages of beginning the book  Rachel is an alcoholic and not just an alcoholic but a blackout drinker  She is obsessed with her ex husband and with a young couple  Megan and Scott  that are his close neighbors  Rachel is engaged in a horrific downward spiral  that gets only more complicated when Megan is murdered and Rachel wakes up with injuries and blood on her and no memory of what occured  The story takes you on this frustrating spiraling search with Rachel as she tries to remember  sorting through false memories and lies I had guessed the ending somewhat before  it seemed obvious to me  but I don t want to give any spoilers  Just to say this is really one of those stories that shows that you never really know someone else  As an aside  there is an old movie that this reminded me of somewhat The Morning After  fans of the book might like the movie  If you liked Gone Girl  read this book  It s intense  full of twists and turns  haunting and well done  Prepare to have a hard time putting this book down  I ve stayed up past my bedtime for two nights in a row to finish it   Couldn t stop reading it After the next book for a long trip  then the girl on the train is a great option  Read it non stop during a 7 h flight between Sydney to Tokyo  Really entertaining  The end was a bit Hollywoodish  but who caress  the whole story is awesome  Great thriller 4 5  People are comparing this book to Gone Girl  but I would have to disagree  Gone Girl is far more psychologically dark and terrifying  this book is more of a light thriller with a bit of psychological mis happenings  But that s not to say this book is bad  the book is fantastic  The characters are flawed but it is written in such a way that it makes the book very enjoyable and the characters very likeable  I loved the depth of Rachel s character  it really went into why she drinks  why she is almost insane in my opinion  why sue obsesses  and it s clever  Megan to was also very intriguing  she is a terrific liar  But she too is flawed  and although she is flawed  she is such a perfect character  Much like Rachel  the two are a perfect blend of crazy and sane  there is a little bit of a nut in both their personalities  The story started a little slow  but it really picked up and I found myself reading a lot each day  trying to put it down to savour it for the next day  but it s only lasted me a week  The ending was a twist I didn t see  and that s what I like   a book that keeps you questioning and the answer is not what you expect  If you like Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl or A S A Harrison s The Silent Wife  than The Girl On The Train will be a fun read for you  although not as intense  it is definitely a very psychologically interesting book Overall  4 5 stars  it just lacked a little in the beginning and somewhat in the middle  but it makes up for it  A terrific thriller     Can t wait to see what Paula Hawkins delivers next  Idk what to feel about the ending  actually  I was really enjoying the story and maybe expected too much but    I still liked it  I can t help but feel so bad for Rachel though at first I don t even find her a likeable character at all  But then omg I just want to hug her and Cathy too cause she s such a good friend and can we just appreciate Cathy more please  Great suspense mystery  The events of a disappearance as remembered by someone in a drinker blackout  I had to keep reading to find out what really happened   Murder mysteries aren t my favorite genre  but I couldn t stop reading this book  It was difficult to predict  and I appreciate that in a book  I couldn t get the last line of the old folk song   Frankie and Johnny  out of my head   This story only goes to show you  that there just ain t no good in men  They ll do you wrong  just as sure as you re born   I liked this thriller  It has tight writing suspense and good character development  Nothing is what it seems to be  The people who look perfect have huge problems   The ones who have flaws in the beginning   have their reasons to be what they are  And they will find their way  The main character Rachel is broken  She is not broken for the reasons we think she is  That her ex left her for someone else  There are more thing  She is divorced and she hates the fact that her ex left her when she had problems because could not have a baby  And in addttion he found an other woman and now he has a baby  She is a wreck and it is understandable  She could not realize that she will not really have a baby and her husband never supported her  And in addition he found another woman and he did what she always wanted in the same house she chose to live and tells her how happy the new wife is  I think that it is not that strange that she is still blaming him for not being supportive enough  for treason  etc  And i think that she is right in many ways  Tom was selfish   he did care just for his joy and he still is this kind of person I suspected in the first forty pages what happens between the three ladies and their relationship  This is the reason that i gave four stars and not five  I did not like Anna but i liked how realistic she was portrayed  There are many Annas everywhere  Mengan on the other side had her own demons to fight  Her fault is that in her desperation she did could not make the right choices  The mystery was good even if i had suspected it as possible  It is a good book if you enjoy thrillers and mystery  It has similar points with the gone girl book   obviously but many things are different   it is not the same book  thank god  even if i liked both  A well written  UK centric  crime novel based around commuting in and out of London  Unlikely as it sounds  from this mundane premise emerges an original  highly readable and absorbing tale  The tale is told from the viewpoints of some of the characters and each narration frequently gives a very different perspective on the same events  There are hints of the denouement quite early on thereby reducing some of the suspense and yet The Girl on the Train remains intriguing and engrossing from start to finish 4 5 I m going to keep this short and sweet  because just about everyone is talking about this book  and well  what can I say that hasn t already been said  I picked it up knowing very little about it  just that it was named  the book to read in January  and of course the endless comparisons to Gone Girl  It seems anytime a psychological thriller is written by a woman it s suddenly the next Gone Girl  and in my opinion that hurts a book more than helps it  Gone Girl is really one of a kind  and comparing everything to it sets a really high almost impossible to reach standard  Girl on the Train is a wonderful mystery  It pulled me in and I was determined to know what really happened that night  All of the characters were interesting  but also unlikeable and that always keeps my attention  Although I wouldn t compare this to anything by Gillian Flynn I really enjoyed reading Girl on the Train and would recommend it to mystery lovers   It is one of those books that you finish in one day  A modern Hitchcock style mystery with an unreliable narrator that is an alcoholic There are comparisons to Gone Girl  but I found this mystery darker  Sabem quando pensam  este devia ser o assassino   mas nada da historia leva a crer isso  Foi o que se passou com este livro  A escrita e intensa e esta bem conseguida  So fiquei desiludida com o final  estava a espera de algo ainda mais dramatico   Por isso as 4 estrelas  que estao quase a cair para as 5   a great psychological thriller   once i started reading it i couldn t stop   the main character is Rachel  the girl on the train   a depressed drunkard  she spends her days pretending that she s going to work  everyday she takes the train that goes past a stretch of cozy suburban houses  and on her little journeys she daily watch and imagines the life of the same couple who live in one of the houses  she named them  Jess and Jason   They are the perfect couple  or at least they are inside her head  but one day   Rachel sees Jess Kissing some guy  a guy who wasn t Jason her Husband  and she s devastated Jess goes missing soon after that  and Rachel manages to get herself into a huge mess  a lot of secrets  dirty secrets  i really enjoyed this book  it was just amazing   A decent debut thriller  Written from various character perspectives a la Martin Amis  London Fields or Julian Barnes  Talking it Over  several of the key scenes overlap to provide different insight into the same events  I won t rehash the premise of the story  read the blurb   At times it can be a slightly uncomfortable read  more through the open and honest way the characters and their thoughts are portrayed  although this does lend itself to a lack of sympathy with any of the main characters  It may stretch credulity at points but it did the job of keeping me reading  As I said  a decent  well written thriller  with an engaging plot that you won t necessarily guess the ending to  I will read the author s next novel which  I think  is praise enough   La chica del tren  ha sido el gran descubrimiento del ano  Lo vi anunciado en tanto sitios que decidi darle una oportunidad  Esperaba un libro de terror  de esos que no te dejan dormir  pero para nada  al menos a mi miedo no me dio  Sin embargo  es un libro que se lee rapido ya que esta muy bien narrado y te ofrece distintos puntos de vista  Aunque la principal es Rachel  la protagonista   El  New York Times  creo  xd  lo califico como un narrador enganoso  y no puedo estar mas de acuerdo  Desde luego  algo tiene el libro que no te permite dejar de leer en ningun momento  Rachel es uno de esos personajes que  aparentemente no es muy interesante y de hecho  en muchas partes del libro  parece que vive a traves de los demas  pero la desaparicion de  Jess   Que no es un spoiler porque desaparece al principio del libro y el resto esta dedicado a la investigacion que lleva a cabo Rachel  y su deseo por descubrir la verdad la llevaran a descubrir numerosos aspectos de su vida  Ademas de investigar toda la vida de Megan e interferir incluso en la labor policial  que tal vez no eran como ella pensaba  Mucha gente lo ha comparado con  Perdida  de Gillian Flynn  aunque no lo he leido  Lo tengo pendiente    The marketing message that is being used for this book is  unreliable narration like Gone Girl  and that had my interest  Not because there s a mention of Gone Girl  there s always a reference to the best selling books in the genre when it comes to introducing new book  almost all fantasy novels use  Harry Potter  in its marketing   but because of the  unreliable narration  part When it comes to unreliable narration  there s one book that I remember the most and it s not Gone Girl  It s The Murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie  Long before Gillian Flynn made her story  Dame Christie and all her brilliancy created such a twist that became phenomenal Anyway  back to The Girl on the Train  It is an awesome thriller book which I finished in a day and I have been in my reading slump before this so this book really helps me get back to my reading straits I d like to mention that unlike Roger Ackroyd and Gone Girl  the  unreliable narration  in this book is different  It wasn t purposely made that way by the character  She is unreliable due to other characters or things in her life  So even though the marketing strategy worked in getting me hooked  I can t help but feeling cheated when I m done reading this book Marketing aside  this book is good  It has all the materials necessary for suspense novel  the twist  the conflict  the dark past  It might be too much at one point but I think we can forgive since the book is really good Is it predictable  Yes  for me it s a bit too predictable  But is it an interesting ride until the last page  You bet  I knew absolutely nothing about this book other than it was on a best seller list  One day  I walked into the library   was told  it s your lucky day  and handed this book  Apparently it is part of a first come  first served program  It doesn t go into the queue and I just happened to be at the right place at the right time  It is not something I would normally pick up but I figured   why not read it after all it was  my lucky day  The main character is Rachel who also narrates her journey on a commuter train and what follows  She watches others as she rides and envisions what she thinks their lies must be like  She is especially involved with the area that used to be her home and is now the home of her ex husband and his current family  In the last couple of years  Rachel has become depressed  put on weight  and started drinking heavily  Those three seem to have a large impact on her lack of confidence and her behavior The other two narrators are Anna  her ex husband s wife  and Megan  a vision from the train and later a murder victim  There are only a few other characters in this book but none of them have a chapter in which they narrate  One day  Rachel sees something showing from the train and decides that she needs to get involved  Soon  she becomes aware of Megan s murder and  for some reason  need to be involved by befriending Megan s husband  There are many twists and turns and the reader is kept in suspense with exactly who could have committed this murder  Paula Hawkins does keep the reader in suspense until near the end Although I loved the surprise of the ending but it didn t seem as strong as the rest of the book  It also took me a bit to get used to the fact that the days of Anna s and Rachel s entries were approximately the same  but Megan s chapters were a couple of month s earlier  I was also not thrilled with the fact that all three women were all out of work and needy  The story would have been just as good  if not better  with stronger female characters  As the girl rides the daily commuter train to London  she stares out her window at rows of houses lining the tracks  She grabs little glimpses into other people s lives  The girl is Rachel  Sometimes she takes what she sees at face value  and sometimes she makes up her own fantasies and stories about what she sees  But then  on a day that seems so much like every other day  she suddenly glimpses something shocking out the window  Now everything has changed  Whether it s Rachel s curiosity or her heroics  something compels her to get off that train and climb aboard a very dangerous ride  Rachel is carrying her own grim baggage  wrestling with her own personal problems as the book proceeds with her involvement in a dark  mystery along the train tracks The author has written this book with Rachel as the primary narrator  but interspersed are chapters written with different narrating characters  As events transpire you ll read from these different perspectives  and you re subject to the different character s motivations  personalities  manipulations and weaknesses  Some of these characters drove me wild with frustration  others touched my heart  and others intrigued me  With this powerfully descriptive writing  they each elicited a strong response in me  It s up to the reader to decide who is really what they seem  and who is not  and whether you re seeing the events described accurately  As a reader  who can you trust Paula Hawkins has written a slow building suspense mystery  It s like a train that starts with a jolt  slowly builds up speed  and then in the end is propelled forward to its ultimate destination  In this case  the rider reader will find the novel s final ending an unannounced surprise  The author said in an interview   I know people like to read about serial killers and spies  but most of us will never encounter these things  Sadly  most of the threats we encounter are at home   This mystery features themes of domestic violence and alcohol and drug abuse  It asks the slippery question of whether people can ever truly know their spouses or themselves  The author describes what makes a psychological mystery more complex than the average thriller   the atmosphere of menace that infects the everyday  Thereby hangs a tale         4 5 en realidad  La comparan con Perdida  No todo un acierto desde mi punto de vista  Perdida para mi no tiene comparacion  me habian hypeado demasiado esta novela y mis ganas de leerla solo aumentaban  Cuando la compre y la empece  el ritmo me parecia muy lento  demasiado  Sabia que tenia que dejar un margen para que me enganchara a la historia  que seguro que lo hacia  Y asi fue  Tras un atracon de lectura  consegui sumergirme de lleno en la trama y los plot twists empezaron a llegar  Es una historia muy confusa  contada desde la perspectiva de diferentes personajes y mezclando espacios temporales del presente y el pasado  El estilo de la autora es perfecto  Sabe introducirte pistas a lo largo de la novela sin que te des cuenta  al igual que hacerte sospechar de todos y de nadie  Me encanta eso de tener que pensar quien es el malo y quien no lo es  Habia muchas cosas que  obviamente  no me esperaba y me ha parecido todo muy acertado  El final es lo que me ha chirriado un poco  pero en este tipo de novelas  suele ser asi  La chica del tren me ha dejado con buen sabor de boca y a pesar de su longitud  es una novela que se lee en un santiamen  I found THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN to be terribly slow at times   I m certain it could have been 100 pages shorter  The first third of the novel was boring  but about halfway through  it really picked up and I was able to finish it in just a few days  Paula Hawkins really kept me engaged and told a great story with some interesting twists and turns  I definitely enjoyed it   Wow  I really didn t expect to like this book that much  I had recently read Gone Girl  which this isn t that similar other than it features twisted  damaged people  but was looking for something that felt close to the same  I was almost sorry that I decided to pick this up as I literally could not put it down and ended up staying up past my bedtime yesterday Rachel  the narrator  is an alcoholic mess who had just reached my OMG just quit whinging already  threshold when the author wisely moved the story forward  She still had her pathetic moments but I empathized with her and hoped she d stop drinking and get help  The book was paced well and had just enough of the other two points of view from Megan and Anna as not to feel like an intrusion  I wasn t surprised by the whodunnit aspect since I had long suspected that character  but kudos to the author for keeping me on my toes with the other possibilties  I really enjoyed reading about the characters  situations and would be interested in Paula Hawkins  next book   Review coming I really  really enjoyed this book  so whoever in book club picked it   good job    It was a little slow to start  and alternating narrators is not something I usually enjoy   but this book made it worth keeping up with  Once it picked up  I was quickly hooked and had to know  who done it  immediately  I am usually frustratingly good at predicting books  and was so pleasantly surprised that I didn t know in the one   each chapter had my questioning everything I had thought so far  I started and finished this book in two evenings   so it s a quick read if you have a few hours  I would definitely recommend  and can t wait to talk it out at book club tomorrow Why not 5 stars  Because this book will not change your life  A month from now  you probably won t still be wondering about the characters or even remembering anything significant about it  I reserve 5 stars for books that are a bit more memorable   the kind that sooth you  haunt you or in some way teach you  Those which you immediately have to tell everyone you know to read  and dread even the thought of it becoming a movie because you have such a vivid version playing in your head and no director will ever get it quite right  But for me to give it 4 stars is still pretty high on my scale  3 5   4 star rating I know there has been a lot of hype about this book  so I was excited to finally read it  However  I don t think it quite matches the hype  It s good  but I was expecting more  Maybe I was expecting too much from the rave reviews I guessed what was going to happen about halfway through  so the big reveal didn t come as a shock  A lot of people seem to compare this book with Gillian Flynn s work  In my opinion it isn t written as well as her books  But saying all that  it is still a good book especially the last 100 pages or so and it only took me 3 or 4 sitting to read  Really good     A real enjoyable suspenseful page turner Once I got into the story just couldn t put it down Great one to read if you commute by train  My View A brilliant expose of addiction  isolation and alcoholism woven neatly into a narrative of manipulation and mystery  The book begins slowly   personally I would have liked to have seen the tempo increased and a little more tension built into the earlier part of the book   yet despite the slow pace I did enjoy this read and there is a lovely twist or two in this one that you will not see coming  The last few chapters are bursting with action  mystery  violence and suspense  This is a great debut novel and this author is certainly one to look out for After you have read this book you will never look at a bottle of wine or a gin and tonic the same way again   Have you read this book  What did you think  I think sometimes the hype surrounding a book can be detrimental to your enjoyment of the read   expectations can cause the bar to be unrealistically high  Perhaps you are better of not having heard anything about this book before you pick it up and let the writing speak for itself   2015 reads   So  This is the ONLY GR award winner I actually liked  0    One  sudden disappearance 0   Two train journeys a day while Rachel seeks happiness out of her life  Morning  evening  morning  evening  All these fucking useless days  I suffered for her  because she s so lonely and hopeless   yet her story could appear to be banal  Alcoholic  divorced  ashamed  So much shame on her shoulders  so much shame but not the force to change  not the force to fight  Because why fighting  Why fighting when we ve nothing to gain  Why  I couldn t help but ache for her  in a way that I m not accustomed to feel  Who could we call  who  to help her  Are there people out there who are able to help someone without wanting a paycheck in exchange  A money paycheck  a virtuous paycheck  a reconnaissance paycheck  a foil to make you look good paycheck  All different but all the same old shit    I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts  Who was it said that following your heart is a good thing  It is pure egotism  a selfishness to conquer all   0   Three unreliable narrators who make us wandering blind throughout the whole story  The creepy factor is always here between the lines  while we start getting hints of truth  the tension slowly growing until we can t help but suspect each and every one of the characters we meet  Okay  maybe not the police officer though  Or yeah  I don t know anymore  and trust me  you won t either  Despite the fact that I guessed a great part of the end toward the 70  mark  the story never became boring   that s quite the opposite  actually   They re a match  they re a set  They re happy  I can tell  They re what I used to be

visit           Great ReadThis book held me captive the entire time  I finished it in three days  I will definitely recommend this book  It started slowly  but the pace quickened as the plot developed  Soon  I couldn t put it down   This book was a potato chip murder mystery  Loved it   4 5 stars I really enjoyed this book  It was a great character study and they were super intriguing  I though that some parts of this book could have been better  but it was overall very enjoyable  I loved the ending  for some reason it made me feel really empowered   Strong finish Not the most likeable characters but that was ok the story of the voyeurism and lies was well worth it  Strong finish   Bam  This one hit me right in the heart  and for all the right reasons  Paula Hawkins  debut is absolutely a ride worth taking  It s intense  suspenseful and also very touching  People s fate and behavior and very entangled relationships moved me  Paula wrote with such swiftness that I was glued to the pages  Towards the end  I was kinda got where it s going but it still kept me guessing  what if  will it  I will definitely recommend this to all the fans of mystery  fiction and fast paced reading  Looking forward to read more of her work  This is probably one of the more captivating thrillers I have read in recent memory  For a debut novelist  career as a journalist notwithstanding   Paula Hawkins has really produced quite an exceptional whodunnit  and with an ingenious structure and narrative style  that worked really well Three women  Rachel  Anna and Megan  share the narrative  and the chapters indicate the time and day of events  as each character sees and experiences them  Rachel travels daily to London on a train to her office and passes by a row of houses each day  She has become particularly enamoured with a couple in one of these houses  whom she names Jason and Jess  But there is more than just random voyeurism that draws her attention to that particular neighbourhood  and Hawkins takes her time revealing important details  as Rachel s story becomes intertwined with Anna s and Megan s  and how these women are connected becomes integral to the central plot  when a crime occurs Hawkins keeps the reader hooked to the many twists and turns in the story  and it is to her credit that she takes time to build up her characters  especially Rachel  the titular girl on the train  who is as pitiable as she is a deplorable parasitic mess  Despite these contrary feelings she incites in the reader  she endears as well and repels  and we are never quite sure if we can fully trust her  The sense of unease permeates the story and the reader cannot rest easy until he or she reaches the last page  A very intriguing read   I have lost control over everything  even the places in my head   Couldn t put it down  I really enjoyed this book   a lone girl on a train passing by the same house every day watching the lives of the 2 inhabitants  she even gives them names  Jessica and Jason  Things change one day when she sees Jessica kissing a man who is not Jason  Then in the news Jessica s body is found   she has been murdered  She decides to get involved by telling the Police about this other man she saw and then she just wont leave things alone causing more trouble  Her ex husband and his new wife live a few doors up from Jason and our girl hasn t gotten over him  The reader really cant sympathise with our main character as she spends most of her time drunk  making a nuisance of herself with the ex  the Police and Jason as the mystery slowly unfolds  There are a few people who could have murdered Jessica but it really keeps you guessing right to the end  I ll join most reviewers and compare this to Gone Girl  It was better  This book was as much about addiction  loss  insecurity  mental illness  and gender roles as it was about an unsolved crime  Both books  characters were almost exclusively terrible human beings  Gone Girl s were wholly self centered and vindictive  The Girl on the Train s were terrible people for reasons that actual people are  they try to find happiness within the constraints of complex and impossible interpersonal relationships and have to come to terms with their inadequacies and cope with rejection  The antecedents of substance abuse and depression are real and relatable and impact the reader  Gone Girl had an intriguing plot but was just full of assholes  Finally a book that lives up to the  good for fans of Gone Girl  accolade  Every single character is such a disaster  which made guessing the conclusion both impossible and fun  Didn t see the ending coming till mostly through with the book  which I loved  It s always fun to be surprised  Another page turner I could not put down  I liked this better than Gone Girl because some more likable characters with all their human foibles  Great  fast page turner read  However it lost some of its umph at the end    but it had me going  A fine sample of mystery  thriller  crime story  Highly recommended   a real page turner  The  who did it   part is not so important  what really matters is that the reader is experiencing the same agony that the heroine is going through  I am expecting many great stories from Paula Hawkins  PT   https   d311nh4 wordpress com 2015 06    A woman rides the rain every day back in forth to work  She passed by a house where she gets a glance at a couple s life  She paints a nice little picture and creates a life she thinks they lead  One day  her perfect couple are not so perfect  Megan  the woman has disappeared  Rachel  the woman who rides the train thinks she suspects who did it  She tries to go to the police but they don t believe her  The story gets complicated  The missing woman used to babysit for Rachel s ex husband and his new wife  Anna  the new wife becomes paranoid of Rachel  I have read some of the reviews and they compare this book to  Gone Girl   I will say it is similar but I enjoyed this book over  Gone Girl   I preferred the main character in this book to that of  Gone Girl  and the book flowed better     It s impossible to resist the kindness of strangers  Someone who looks at you  who doesn t know you  who tells you it s OK  whatever you did  whatever you ve done  you suffered  you hurt  you deserve forgiveness   I liked it but not as much as I loved Gone Girl  I liked the story  the writing style and the characters were so good written  It is good but I didn t enjoy reading it  so depressing  I don t give 5 star reviews very often  so I d give this one a 4 5  It did surprise me  in a number of satisfying ways  First of all   The Girl on the Train  definitely merits all the critical praise and accolades it has received  Slowly at first  then with the pull of an undertow  then compelling  the story    the mystery    pushes the reader forward  picking up speed  like the trains which populate its pages  At first  I liked Rachel  though I felt sorry for her  I found myself feeling the same for Megan  As more back story is revealed  more confessions made  I felt many different things for these characters  but always the sense that no one here is telling the full truth  to others or to themselves  I found myself more and more compelled to find out who was lying  who was holding back  and why  I didn t see the Hitchcock Ian turn coming until near the end  Thoroughly enjoyable  and quite creepy    not monsters in the sewers creepy  but the creepiness of realizing  again  what monsters can lie behind the life of a normal human face and mundane human lives  Not great literature by any measure  but a fabulous  quick  summer thriller  Told from the perspective of 3 different women  the story keeps building suspense throughout  It s not as big of a shocker as Gone Girl  it s much easier to figure out the mystery  But  it s more tightly written  a stronger psychological thriller without giving in to cheaper conventions  I love that the author gave small snippets of the sex scenes  of the lingering before and after  and didn t turn this into a   fifty shades  thriller    It just doesn t need that and smart readers don t either  This story can carry itself  No doubt that this will be made into a movie     If they cast it   and write the screenplay  well it could be as good as Douglass and Close in   Fatal Attraction   I was so annoyed with Rachel s character that I did not see the end coming  Excellent read   Rachel takes the train everyday to go to  work   The train always passes by the house that contained Rachel s old life  She was living with her husband Tom  until he decided to have an affair with another woman  Rachel believes that she s the reason why Tom left her  She couldn t get pregnant  Since she couldn t conceive she became very upset and depressed  She started to drink on a regular basis  Rachel has been taking the train at the same time every single day  She passes by a house where a couple lives  She adores the couple  She looks forward to seeing them everyday  She named them Jess and Jason  She creates their life story in her head  One day as she s passing by on the train she sees something terrible  Rachel has no idea who to tell or what to do I feel like the book was pretty slow passed until about the last 75 pages or so  That s when the story got very juicy  This book made me hate certain characters A Lot   I love Rachel because of all her imperfections  She s just a woman who s having trouble getting her life in order and all of a sudden she is faced with a problem that she can t ignore  You have to be patient with this book because the ending is absolutely worth it  Het meisje in de trein  zinderend thrillerdebuut  bevat alle ingredienten voor een spannend

curiosity was piqued by this novel upon seeing it at the bestseller list for quite a while  at the same time I was quite skeptic as to how this could be such a bestseller With the first few pages I was drawn to Rachel s life and how during her daily train travel to and from her new home she would watch her previous home and her past wonderful life at the same time admiring the couple three houses down  She has in her mind that they are happy   Jess and Jason was what she named them  Then suddenly things are not what they are  I loved the switching of point of views  At the same I wanted to shake Rachel to tell her to stop drinking  stop with those bloody black outs  I wanted to know what she saw remembered  The Girl On A Train is engrossing and will keep you guessing  I did not see it coming and at the same time toward the end of the book  I was like   why is my least favorite character involved   what   and then I went oh   I get it now On a personal note  Thank you Melissa for letting me vent via email   The Girl on the Train is a thriller with many scenes taking place in view of a commuter train into London  There s more than one narrator  pay attention to the chapter headings   but Rachel is our main one  Her life is in shambles  but riding the train each weekday gives her some structure  The people in the houses she sees from the train provide fodder for her fantasies  Fantasy is not reality  though  and reality takes a very dark turn in those houses More thoughts on my blog  including my love of trains in England  with a photo to prove it    The Girl on the Train  The novel The Girl On The Train is a modern day psychological thriller by Paula Hawkins  The protagonist in this story is a girl named Rachel who struggles with an alcohol addiction  Her addiction is what eventually led to the demise of her relationship and might have been one of the factors that motivated her husband to cheat  Her husband Tom ended up marrying his mistress Anna and created Rachel s view of the  perfect family   Rachel takes the same train into London every morning and obsesses over the couple  Megan and Scott  now living in the house that she was supposed to have the perfect life in  One day  the wife of Scott  Megan  goes missing  On the night of her disappearance  Rachel was having trouble controlling her addiction and blacked out  But  we learn that somehow Rachel plays a key role in solving who committed the murder  but we just don t know what exactly her importance is   There s many themes portrayed in Paula Hawkins  novel that we can use in our own lives  Drugs and alcohol play a huge role and Rachel shows us how they make you unreliable in crucial moments and destroy you in all parts of your life  We see how the only known witness  Rachel  ends up lying about what she saw that fateful night because she honestly doesn t remember what happened  Betrayal and faith are other themes we see throughout the novel between the main characters and all the love triangles  I think Paula Hawkins wanted the readers to take away the lesson of controlling your addictions and how one bad choice in your life can lead to many negative outcomes  The major struggle in this novel was Rachel and her inability to recall what happened on that night of Megan s disappearance  I noticed that the conflict was mostly person vs  self rather than person vs  person even though it was a murder mystery  What really stood out to me as a ready is that the author gave readers the chance to figure out for ourselves how Rachel was truly involved in the murder  In most thriller novels I ve read  the reader finds out who did it before the protagonist does  I found it exciting to be able to use my own reasoning to solve a mystery   You have to admit it   Tom is saying   You ve brought this upon yourself  Think about it  if you d just left us alone  you d never be in this situation  I wouldn t be in this situation  None of us would  If you hadn t been there that night  if Anna hadn t come running back here after she saw you at the station  then I d probably have just been able to sort things out with Megan  I wouldn t have lost my temper  I wouldn t have hurt her  None of this would have happened   Hawkins 315   This quote from the story by Tom to Rachel is critical  It shows Tom s sociopath side and how he always seemed to turn everything into Rachel s fault  Tom is so manipulative  that is somehow manages to turn his guilt into murdering Meg into the fault of Rachel   I think it is interesting to get into the mind of these sociopaths like Paula Hawkins does in this psychological thriller and really discover the way they think  manipulate  and their reasoning for their extreme actions  Getting a deeper look into the minds of the characters and killers in this book is what made my experience reading even more interesting  I did not like the main characters as people  but I really don t think you were supposed to  The characters in Paula Hawkins  story weren t meant to make you want to be in the lives  but more so make you apart of their drama  Learning about the characters  past and letting all their secrets unfold is what made the personalities in the story fascinating  Overall  I would recommend this book to anyone with a strong mind who enjoys thrillers and solving their own mysteries   I d give this book a solid 4 5 actually  things were going really slow at some parts and at some parts I just wanted everything to slow down  I must say the audio book was a great way of reading or listening to this book because the narrators made it seem all so real  And I m actually surprised that I liked this book at all because I ve never been interested in reading thriller books  I mostly prefer watching the movie versions of this specific genre  but I think that may change now   This is a very good book  Walau diceritakan dari beragam sisi para perempuan dalam cerita ini  ceritanya sendiri mengalir dan ga bikin bingung  Mudah untuk switch on and off dari satu karakter ke karakter lainnya  Sorry for spoiler ya guys  Ga banyak kok   I can t help to feel sorry for Rachel  karakter yang digambarkan alkoholik  pengidap depresi  tanpa pekerjaan  dan masih mengharapkan mantan suaminya yang sudah menikah kembali dengan Anna  selingkuhannya waktu masih sama Rachel  dan punya anak  Sama bingung dan jengkelnya dengan Anna waktu dia diteror oleh telepon telepon Rachel  although not so much dipertengahan setelah gue tahu kalau dia      Wondering what Megan feels  Dia itu penyelingkuh kambuhan  get a kicked of excitement from it dan yakin partner selingkuhannya pun sama  Dan Tom   Saya paling ingin tahu isi kepalanya sebenarnya  Well  it was a good journey with a fast London train  tempat kita bisa mengintip sebentar dan membayangkan kehidupan orang orang di rumah rumah sepanjang rel yang kita lalui  Just don t get obsessed by it   Rachel her gun trenle Londra daki isine giderken yol uzerinde gordugu evleri  manzarayi ezberlemis ve surekli takip etmektedir  Ozellikle her gun kirmizi isikta tren durdugunda  evlerinin onunde durup baktigi ve onlarin hayatina imrenigi bir cift vardir  Onlara isim bile vermistir ve o muhitteki evlerin ic dizaynlarini bildigi icin evin icinde nasil hareket ettiklerini tahmin etmeye calismaya baslamistir  Her gun gelip

trenden indigini hatirlamasinin ardindan kendini bir anda olayin icinde bulur  Tek sorun Rachel in bir cok seyi unutan bir hafizasinin olmasidir  Belkide aslinda hatirlanacak bir olayin olmamasidir  Kayip kiz filmini izlememis olsaydim belki daha fazla etkilenirdim bu kitaptan  10 8 diyebiliriz  Kurgusu guzel ve alisilmisin disinda bir roman  Kitap 350 sayfa ama ben 200 sayfayi gunlerce surundurdum  ama son 150 sayfa bir cirpida bitti  Baslarda Rachel ayri anlatti  Rachel in eski kocasi Tom un yeni karisi Anna ayri anlatti  komsulari Megan ayri anlattigi icin kafam karisti ama sonunda tum taslar yerine oturdu  Gerilim kategorisine degilde  polisiye kategorisine daha cok uyuyor  Firsatini bulursaniz okuyun derim  The Girl on the TrainThis is a much better story than it seems to be even three quarters of the way through  So  in this one case  even if you dislike the book  please disregard my usual advice to toss it unfinished into the recycle bin or give it to the library  and instead please read all the way to the end  Rachel is a woman who rides the train to work  back and forth between two areas just outside of London  As she rides she drinks  mini bottles of wine  canned gin and tonics   and she looks out at the houses  especially in one particular area where she used to live  She s interested in one house because her ex husband  Tom  still lives there  And  looking at another 2 doors down  she s started to fantasize about the relationship between the man and woman who occupy the place  She thinks the woman  Megan  is so beautiful and ideal  her husband  Scott  is so loving and protective  Ex husband  Tom  and his current wife have a new baby  They seem very happy too  Rachel regrets this  really  and she still misses Tom very much  In fact she keeps calling him all the time  He hates it  That s the start  five characters  add the psychiatrist of one member of the group  and you have all the main players  There are a few hangers on    but this is clearly the principal cast  And  boy  what these guys do to each other and themselves emotionally  mentally and even physically is really hard to handle  Of course  it all evolves so slowly  told usually through the frequently drunken eyes of Rachel   The Girl On The Train  but also augmented by the remembrances of the other two women  The subtext of the whole story is honesty or the lack thereof  Is anyone honest  Or is this really a story about deceit and lying Four stars  If you can cope with this gang of nutcases through the whole book you deserve what you get    a really great ending  OBTW  the audio book is wonderful  The readings  by three different actresses with three very distinct voices  are very strong  real  and just    damn unnerving   The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins kept my attention until the very end  Once you board this train  It s hard to get off  A great beach read  A book for lovers of thrillers  I enjoyed all the twists and turns till I got to the conclusion  It s hard to like any of the characters  be they male or female  but you do feel pity for Rachel  a woman who can t let go of her ex husband and who is drunk so often  You do root for her  you want her to kick her alcohol  her ex and move on It s easy to see how she gets caught up in the lives of Megan and Scott from the glimpses from the train  they look like the couple she wishes she and her ex were  We all fantasize about strangers at times  make up stories about them  The author writes well  she keeps the plot moving she keeps you interested throughout  Really enjoyed the ride   I was in two minds as to whether I should read this or not as previous novels I have tried  with lavish recommendations and positive reviews  fell rather flat  However it was the premise that drew me into this as my partner and I have often idly speculated about houses and gardens we have viewed from passing trains  The inevitable comparisons to  Gone Girl  have been made but rather miss the point  While there are some minor similarities  it s the differences to that book that make this a worthwhile read  What makes this stand out for me was the very successful voicing of three main characters and the often unsympathetic way in which they not only are viewed  but view themselves and others  The development of each character and the plot through their own thoughts  actions and timelines is well paced although I sometimes had to return to the beginning of each chapter to get the date of the chapter to place it in context which was one of the few irritants of the book The mystery at the centre of the book  the disappearance of the woman that Rachel  the main protagonist  views from the train window is a well designed plot device  While it is the cornerstone of the interactions of all the players in the book  it serves to expose each of the main characters personalities  foibles  weaknesses  strengths and uncover the distasteful aspects of each of their lives  It is the very flaws of the characters that holds the plot up and makes it such a fascinating read  The twist of the whodunnit was something I had worked out very early on but was eager to continue reading to see how it would be revealed All in all this was a compelling read  free from Hollywood scripted heroes and heroines and based around character flaws and suburban living in the UK  It s very ordinariness in an extraordinary situation was a very strong point  There was no celebration of flaws  nor tacit acceptance  and the failures of each of the characters was writ large within the plot  Like life  the denouement was not clean nor spectacular  but messy and difficult  So apart from the flipping back and forth to ensure I understood the timeline  which may be a flaw in the way I read rather than the mechanics of the book itself  this was a very enjoyable read  Paula Hawkins has a very good grasp of the flawed psyche that makes up modern life  and writes it very convincingly  I was kept enthralled throughout and rarely skimmed  I hope to see more from this author and soon This was certainly an interesting psychological thriller  You know you have been in the situation where you are playing a mind game with yourself to pass the time on the train  or the airport  or whatever  Making up stories about the people that are around you   and even better when you see those people on a regular basis  This books delves into this kind of mind game and explores the tricks that your mind can play on you  as well as discusses the very true facts of alcoholism  Mixing your mind games with what alcoholism can do to your memory and you get a taste of what this book explores  Did she  didn t she  was it him  her  an accident  Is she okay  All the questions bounced through my head as the girl on the train lived out her drama   I get the comparisons to Gone Girl  most of the characters are thoroughly unlikable  The ending is more palatable  but the writing is not as good as GG   four stars riveting read   Definitely un puttdownable   Rachel is a commuter  She catches the same train and sits in the same carriage every day  Her train stops at the same signals and she finds herself watching the inhabitants of the trackside house  Giving them names and occupations and creating  lives  for them  Rachel used to live in that street with her ex husband  Before alcohol broke down her marriage and before her life fell apart  The book is told from the POV of three women  Rachel  the alcoholic commuter  Anna  the new wife who provided a child and Megan  the arty neighbour who Rachel always sees from the train  As Rachel sinks deeper into alcoholism the book becomes harder to read  She is more incoherent and no longer knows what or why she is doing things  Then Megan disappears and Rachel knows that she was in the area when it happened  A blackout leaves her unable to help the police despite her good intentions  This is a thriller with a twist in the same way that Gone Girl captured the imagination  As a commuter myself I could relate a bit to the story and the  snooping  that Rachel had done from the train  It is a well thought out story and a fast but very enjoyable read   The inside flap of the book cover calls  The Girl on the Train   compulsively readable   and to date I have yet to hear a better description of the book  A  Gillian Flynn  esque read  I thought that the disturbed unravelling of the plot and unconventional and unreliable characters set a decent and  again  disturbing pace for the book  I was initially drawn in by the brief synopsis in the book cover and found myself wondering when the prophesied  big moment  was going to occur in the beginning of the read  And when said  big moment  did occur  I wasn t struck by it s seemingly earth shattering realization  Only when the book  and characters  developed did the whole read become a twisted puzzle with pieces only fitting in to their spots at surprisingly random moments  I enjoyed that the realizations were on my own as I uncovered the developing storyline and not laid out in front of me as an obvious go to  I am excited for Hawkins  career and her next release I would have preferred to give a rating of 4 5 stars   but Goodreads  Wow  this was a real page turner  particularly as the story progressed  The Girl on the Train has all the elements in a great  fast paced thriller  Most intriguing was the portrayal of the mind of an alcoholic  The plot is full of twists and turns and keeps you guessing  Just who can you trust   is there anyone out there who isn t lying  cheating  or even murdering  The reader does feel sorry for the main character  until she too becomes a suspect  No one s immune from scrutiny  Who s account of events can you believe  What s real  What s fantasy  A very interesting first thriller from Paula Hawkins  I kept wondering who would play whom in the film that will likely be made from this best seller   Fast paced good book   a great take on vacation book  Wow  downloaded this one yesterday morning  finished it by nightfall  Loved it  What fun she had with the narration  Completely unreliable  Great page turner  Liked it much better than Gone Girl  Highly recommend  Encore un peu trouble de toute cette histoire    captivante du debut a la fin  Un roman tres bien ecris  un suspense bien dose et des personnages tous plus inquietants que les autres  Je donne un 4     bien merite  The Girl on the Train is a twisty psychological thriller featuring some very unreliable narrators  Rachel is a washed up  alcoholic thirty something who creates a fantasy about a couple she sees out the window of her daily train ride into London  In her mind  they re a happy  loving  perfect pair     until one day  the woman turns up missing  By coincidence  or maybe not   this couple lives down the street from Rachel s ex husband  his new wife  and baby  With seemingly good intentions  Rachel manages to insert herself into the investigation of the woman s disappearance  but realizes she may have played more of a role in what happened than she thinks  The story unfolds through the point of view of three women  Rachel  Megan  the woman who disappeared   and Anna the wife of Rachel s ex   Megan is keeping secrets from her husband  Rachel can t stop screwing up her life  and Anna just wants Rachel to go away and leave her alone  Each woman s unique personality and point of view opens up a new window into what happened to Megan  and as the story develops  we realize that they are more connected than we originally thought  The technique really keeps the plot rolling and the suspense building    this is a book that is hard to put down   Note  the time frame jumps back and forth between the present and the past  which confused me for a while until I started paying attention to the dates  So watch out for that  The Girl on the Train is poised to be another popular suspense novel in the vein of Gone Girl   Frankly  I liked Girl on the Train better because I didn t have to put up with such despicable characters   If you re looking for a dark  fast paced novel with lots of surprises  try this book  Without giving anything away  this is often compared to  Gone Girl  and I m not sure that s a fair comparison  Yes  it s a mystery involving infidelity and an unreliable narrator  But that s where the similarities ended for me This book is told from the POV of three women  There s Rachel  the alcoholic ex wife  She witnessed something  but she was too drunk to remember and nobody believes her anyways  Throughout the book  I wanted her to pull it together so badly  There s Anna  the current wife  who just wants Rachel to leave them alone  And there s Megan  the neighbor  who goes missing  The three women are all given a fair amount of complexity to their stories  maybe Anna the least of all  She doesn t get much backstory beyond her affair with Rachel s then husband  leading to Rachel s divorce  The timelines are somewhat jumbled  which was confusing at first  I kept trying to match up dates in my head and eventually gave up  allowing Megan s timeline to exist in the somewhat recent past from the others  I found the ending mostly satisfying  more than  Gone Girl    Things seemed mostly wrapped up by the time we reached the conclusion  though I spent most of the book with absolutely no idea where we were going or how we were getting there   Acabei esse livro aos prantos  Li em so 3 dias e ainda nao sei bem o que pensar  so que o sentimento de melancolia ainda paira em mim  The only reason that I can t give this book five stars is that Rachel frustrated the heck out of me  Maybe it s because I ve had the misfortune of dealing with an alcoholic in my own life  and I have no patience for drunks  That might sound insensitive of me  but alcoholism affects those who love them   and I have been scarred by someone like her  Rachel is a mess  She can t get over her husband leaving her for another woman  She s a stalker  She s a victim  and she s pretty pathetic  in my view   She s pretending to go to a job she s been fired from  riding the training every day and living vicariously through a couple she sees each day as the train stops  There s a murder  She s blacked out and can t remember what happened  I love a good mystery thriller  but this book didn t quite deliver the mystery for me  I m not saying I didn t like the book  but it s one star short of  exciting  for me  Good narrator  though  Good read  Was on the NY best sellers list This is a really good book  My heart was always beating hard  Hawkins  the writer  always made me feel part of this story  I gave it only 4 stars just because the end should be better   3 5Se lee rapido pero hasta la mitad me ha resultado muy lento  Luego coge mas ritmo y el final es predecible  Esta bien pero no es para tanto como lo ponen  Muito se tem dito e escrito sobre este livro  Muitos tem falado que o seu sucesso reside na publicidade extensiva que teve  o que nao nego  mas nao creio que seja so esse o motivo  Os leitores gostam de obras que lhes toquem na alma  Por mim falo  Um autor pode ser de renome  elogiado pelos maiores criticos e escrever obras que nada dizem as pessoas  Pode usar dos recursos estilisticos mais elaborados  mas se nao tiver  alma   se nao tocar o leitor de nada vale  Esta e a velha conversa de que so o que e escrito por autores de certas elites  e  caramba  em Portugal ve se tanto disso     e que e bom  Porem  muitos se esquecem de que esta e a primeira obra da autora  E  de facto  estamos perante uma estoria construida de forma extremamente inteligente e que conquista o leitor em absoluto  pese embora o inicio algo monotono  Isso e a escrita demasiado linear  tanto pode ser motivo para se gostar menos da obra como para le la com mais fulgor  foram os motivos pelos quais nao atribui cotacao maxima Nao e um policial nem um thriller psicologico  na verdadeira acepcao da palavra  Achei mais um  tratado  sobre mentes perturbadas  bem como isso se pode traduzir em accoes  Neste caso  na pessoa de  mulheres  traidas e abandonadas  como se de um objecto se tratassem  Isso o leitor so conseguira perceber mais para o fim  E mais poderia eu abordar mas tiraria toda a piada   A Rapariga no Comboio e uma obra que cativa o leitor  que faz com que  a dada altura  este comece a sentir as  dores  de uma das personagens e e eximia em voltas e reviravoltas  Le se num apice  da que pensar e mantem nos agarrados a leitura  Gostei muito e recomendo vivamente  I was on the edge of my  train  seat this whole book  Paula Hawkins has written a very engrossing and suspenseful story with The Girl on the Train  Rachel is a divorced and well meaning  but seemingly disillusion  out of a job drunk who rides the train into London every day  The highlight of the trip every day is watching what she thinks is the perfectly married couple whom she has named  Jess and Jason   This couple turns out to be not what she imagined  and between Megan  the mysterious couple  and Rachel s ex husband and his new wife  this story will have you pulling out your hair  yelling at the characters  and mentally exhausted  What a train wreck  I mean  train ride  Likes   PAGE TURNER  Couldn t put it down Everybody up in here is an unreliable narrator  kept it very interesting  LONDON  trains  British speak Twists   turns  Rachel compulsively makes the worst decisions but it made for a good story  figured it out  but didn t detract from the story Great insight into how much we can t know about others from the outside   every one is fighting a hard battle Was a bit curious about how everybody compared this to Gone Girl  it was not nearly as nasty but just as riveting Dislikes  Lots of heavy life issues  may or may not be triggery for some people  Does not romanticize the issues   isn t overly descriptive with them  Kitabi gercekten sevdim  Karakterlerin hicbirisine sevgi beslemesemde olaylar heyecanliydi ve merak ettiriyordu  Biraz yogundu yani 50  sayfadayim sanki 100 sayfalik olay oldu gibi geldi  Bide katil bekledigim kisi cikti     Definitely a page turner  but not my favorite book  The characters needed more substance   The Girl on the Train is an interesting story that I was unsure I was going to enjoy due to a mild plot which lacked lots of excitement  As the book began  it seemed to be a repetition of a woman named Rachel s ride to and from work every morning and evening  however after the first chapter  the narrators changed and showed a different characters perspective  She passes a strip of Suburban homes  and one of them used to be the house she lived in with her ex husband  Every day she takes the train it reminds her of the life she recently has lost  She also gets a brief glimpse into the lives of a new couple  and she begins to follow and create personas for the strangers  As the book went on  the reader begins to realize that Rachel is an avid alcoholic who is still grieving over her divorce  Her husband unexpectedly cheated on her  and evidently she is still in love with him  She drunk calls him and is a major threat to his new family  She is stuck in this grief that she cannot overcome and uses alcohol as a coping mechanism  As she examines the perfect life of the couple who lives by the train tracks  she discovers the woman kissing another man  and recognizes in those short few seconds that their lives are not exactly as they seem  Because she is familiar with the pain that an affair brings someone  she goes to the police with this information  and gets tangled into the lives of everyone involved in the investigation  It is compelling to see the narrators lives slowly intertwine as the book goes on  I somewhat sympathize Rachel for all of the misfortunes that she has exerienced in her life  Nobody should have to face a brutal divorce like she did  however she makes me so angry that she cannot get her act together and fix her life  I want to go into the book and stop her from buying more and more alcohol  and I want to bring her to an AA meeting  It is hard to sympathize a drunk who makes no efforts to fix her life  and that made the book somewhat frustrating to read  I think that it is interesting that she lives through this couples perfect life  yet it gets ruined just like hers did  Hawkins does an excellent job making a character affect the reader  as well as creating suspense  I deffinetly recommend this book to anyone interested in an unpredictable thriller because once I got into it  I couldn t put it down  This was great  I m glad I didn t start hearing the comparisons to Gone Girl until after I d finished this novel  This is not Gone Girl  In fact I really didn t see any similarities other than the fact that this is a mystery thriller  This book can stand on it s own two feet without the Gone Girl references  The main character  Rachel is a complete and utter mess but underneath it all  a good person  She has some problems that she s trying to work through  while trying to piece together events from a night she doesn t remember  There were some plot twists I didn t see coming and there were elements I kinda wondered about while reading but it all made sense in the end  A highly compelling read   Rachel Watson has spent the last few years stumbling through life in a booze filled depression ever since her husband left her for another woman  Now she wiles away her days riding the commuter train to and from London  despite having been fired from her job months ago  The train makes a daily stop by her old neighborhood and it is here she spies a couple appearing to be living a perfect life from a beautiful home  She begins to fantasize about the couple  inventing little lives and backstories for them to keep her mind off her own troubles  Rachel witnesses something from the train that upsets her more than it should  and when Megan goes missing  she believes she has key evidence  She goes to the police but the police dismiss her as a drunken  unreliable witness  So she takes things into her own hands  I liked hearing the story from three different people and how the stories overlapped and intertwined  There wasn t much to like as far as characters were concerned  I felt sorry for Rachel as she had lost all that was important to her  I felt something for Megan too  but she was the cause of some of her problems  Anna and Tom were something else and until the very end  I wasn t sure what Anna would do  A quick suspenseful read with lots of twists and turns   This was a fun little read  kept me guessing until the last 1 4 of the book  It didn t get too deep into the depravity of murder  which was kind of nice  The main character s struggle with alcoholism was painful to read and I found myself caught up in wanting her to succeed  I agree with other reviewers  this was not another thriller along the lines of Gone Girl  It was refreshingly its own story  It did remind me more of Rear Window  except without the male hero I hope Hawkins writes more thrillers   Ok  That was a rollercoaster ride  I do see why this was being compared to Gone Girl  This book kept me guessing and guessing  Everyone is a suspect  And then they weren t  And then they were victims  And then I don t know anymore  This book played with my mind and my emotions  I need to take a breather    WritingIf you haven t heard about this one  I feel like you must be living under a rock  Or at least avoiding the  books like Gone Girl  craze  I feel like you can t review this book without saying the words  Gone Girl   although the books are honestly quite different  They re similar only in that both are psychological thrillers with a slow building tension followed by a surprise ending with plenty of red herrings thrown in to keep you guessing  I should probably just C P this paragraph and add it to every single psychological thriller I read because I do tend to gravitate towards them and you absolutely cannot avoid a comparison if you publish in the genre That said  the writing here stands on its own without needing to be compared to anything else  It s full of characters who are so difficult to like  but who you just can t stop reading about  They re all perfectly loathsome  and still perfectly believable  because they re horrible in very normal ways  The plotting moves quickly  but the tension builds slowly in a very smart way  Having an unreliable narrator totally works in this case  And the ending is terrifying in a very Hitchcockian sense Entertainment ValueI was totally caught up in the story and in learning what was Rachel really saw and what she only imagined  It kept me up late  which is the mark of a good thriller  and I was guessing until the last few chapters  Completely enthralling and something that I think most people will find themselves happily caught up in OverallIf you re a fan of unreliable narrators  psychological suspense  slow building dread and tension  or  yes  if you re looking for something similar to Gone Girl in its domestic setting and love to hate characters  this is the book for you  Nothing stuck out to me as particularly graphic  but there is some violence and language  if I recall correctly  Obviously  it wasn t anything I found over the top or offensive or even memorable Thanks to my local library for providing me with a copy  I gave this book 4 stars for the parts written from Rachel s perspective  I thought these parts were the most believable and interesting   she is certainly a flawed character and the holes in her memory from alcohol add an interesting element to the familiar theme of a narrator with an unreliable memory  The author paced the book well and took care in describing the houses  the train journey  and Rachel s lethargy and depression so that I didn t feel we were simply racing between confrontations  I enjoyed reading a character who often made bad decisions but also made good ones   I hate reading a thriller just wishing characters would confide in someone  or go to the police  It was better for feeling that Rachel was trying to do the right thing but was letting herself down despite her best intentions I didn t enjoy the parts of the book written from Megan s perspective nearly as much  and Scott s character seemed bizarrely inconsistent  although I suppose he was meant to be unhinged after his wife s disappearance and generally jealous  I did feel that the hints at the reveal came a bit too early and were a bit too obvious  Also the final  confession  scene wasn t as believable or slowly drawn as the other parts  Overall I did really enjoy this book and I d be interested to read more by this author  Pick a comfy chair and pour a glass of wine   This book grabs you  pulls you in and holds you hostage  I read to the wee hours  desperately wanting to find out what happens but at the same time not wanting it to end I loved the rotating voices and not knowing who to trust  I used to hate books with sketchy lead characters  now I love them  I love that Rachel is flawed  a liar and a drunk  She became real  I didn t like her but I was rooting for her  Rachel  Anna and Megan all tied together and lost at the same time  It was fascinating to see how the characters were developed and the story built Rachel is lost  alone and riding the train into London   to a job she was fired from  She people watches out the train window  and one day sees something that startles her  Should she report it  Did she really see it happen  Whenever I thought I had it figured out   I was wrong I held of reading this one   thinking if its like Gone Girl I can do with NOT reading it but I am glad I did  This book has been compared to Gone Girl and Before I Go to Sleep and that s absolutely spot on  it s a perfect blend of the two  especially with the gaps in vital memories and the feeling that you haven t been told everything about the main characters  I couldn t guess what was going to happen right up until the very end  The reveal was great and the last few scenes were really tense  There was more action than I was expecting from this kind of novel  which was surprising as most of the commentary on the mystery at hand came from the outsider s point of view  which at times was questionable at best   3 5 Me ha gustado  La primera parte se me hizo un poco lenta  pero luego iban pasando cosas que te enganchan  Si que es verdad que llega un punto en que ya sospechas como puede terminar  pero luego llegas al final y te confirma lo que pensabas  pero no sin antes sorprenderte de nuevo  En el final  me ha faltado reafirmar mas el desenlace de algun personaje Tambien me ha gustado como los trenes y las vias estaban presentes durante toda la novela   www kitapezgisi comGenelde bu kadar fazla reklami yapilan  alin  kesinlikle okuyun   denilen

along the way that I ve figured out how it was going to end and still didn t expect that ending  Every character is broken in their own way and you feel sad for each one of them  Sometimes good people get in bad situations that go from bad to worse and there seems to be no way to swim to the shore  Really loved it  It would make a good vacation read   This one was quite the troubling read  While it was clear right from the start that the main character Rachel had some major mental issues  The other main characters Megan  Anna  Tom    Scott appeared to be upstanding pillars of society  But little by little these characters also demonstrated their dark and deeply disturbed sides  It makes one wonder just how many apparently normal people out there are in reality hiding deep inner pain  despair  and conflict  The Girl on the Train is the epitome of pure suspense and tension  The book is written from the point of view of three female characters but the heroine and the main voice of this story is definitely Rachel  She is the only character for whom the reader is supposed to experience empathy because she goes through a lot while trying to figure out how her actions connect with the disappearance of Megan Jess  What upset me the most was Rachel becoming everyone s punching bag  She was constantly insulted  humiliated  undermined and considered the lowest of the low and instead of standing up for herself she just sat back and took the punches   view spoiler   Years of emotional manipulation and physical abuse damaged her confidence and caused her feelings of worthlessness    hide spoiler   And yes  Rachel had a low self esteem and was too emotionally dependent on men but she was also persistent  observant and tenacious in her quest to discover the truth that would finally set her free and allow her to move on   Solid 4 5 This was a great audio  I wanted to shout at every character in this book  Geez Louise  that was stressful  I had this on a  to read  list for a while  I hesitated because it was compared to Gone Girl and I absolutely hated Gone Girl  I finally gave this a shot  It s a great read  Suspenseful and messes with your mind  Rachel is an alcoholic  She had it all  A great job  a great husband  a great house  She failed though  and her life shattered  Now  she takes the 8 06 AM train and the 5 54 PM train  Everyday she rides the train  she sees her old house  Saw the curtains change to pink when her ex husband and his new wife had a baby  She tries not to look at it though  She s focused her attention on the house 4 houses down  She s made a life for these people  See s the husband  doting on the wife  The wife  an artist  always on the terrace or drawing  On a Saturday night  drunk  she goes back to that road  Blacks out and doesn t remember what happened  The next day  she learns that the woman she sees at the house every day has gone missing  This story takes you on so many twists and turns  You start to wonder who did it  how they did it and if she s even dead or not  I very much recommend this novel  A little predictable  but still a really fun read  Highly recommended   I had no idea what this book was about when I started besides it being about a girl on a train  I m a girl and I really like trains so I thought why not  It took me till about half way through the book and much confusion to realize that it was a thriller  Like everyone is out of their minds  worse than Gone Girl thriller  Then I thought it was pretty good    A case of the right book at the right time  I think  Really kept me gripped   didn t want to put it down  and I didn t find it predictable   I think the hype ruined the story just a little for me  It was greatly written though and I still enjoyed it  I was expecting a bit more but it s still a great mystery story  Wow   Page turner  doesn t begin to describe how thrilling this novel reads  I walked around my house with the book open because I was so entrenched in the plot details that I didn t want to hit pause  I read it straight through  feeling a mixture of nausea and excitement with each page  There wasn t a moment of boredom  which  for a 325 page book  is quite an achievement  Even more invigorating than the story s constant action are the characters themselves  The men in this story are horrifying  not only because of what they do in the story but because of how utterly realistic they are  I appreciate this because Hawkings veers off the traditional two person one enemy story and truly confuses the reader by illustrating misogyny  sex  and power as universal concepts in this small and quiet town  Your eyes are constantly fleeting from one relationship to the next  deciphering the character s every move and attempting to piece it all together as the pieces get more and more multiplied  The women  too  are equally fascinating  I m on Rachel s side  but I can t trust her  If I was a character in this story  I could easily see how everything she says is unreliable and how she looks as a drunk to everyone around her  even herself  However  I also see her pain and her sorrow  and I sympathize with it  There are moments in her thoughts and volitions where you see her intelligence  particularly through her occasional analysis of her friends  relationships  She s a smart girl  clouded and buried underneath so much  Anna  too  is startling  For a while  I kept mixing up her and Megan  because the two are such strong and internally confusing people that it almost got hard to keep track  but right up until the end  I remained puzzled and intrigued  Like I said before  not a moment of boredom  Some commenters have compared have compared this book to  Gone Girl   and I agree and disagree  Like  Gone Girl   it was fast paced and difficult to put down  However  unlike  Gone Girl   I left with no disappointment  It was not painfully predictable  and its thrill lay in more than just the action  The characters themselves were far more real  and it kept that realism and intrigue right up until its end  That s not to say I was blown away by its end  Hawkins definitely unraveled it at a pace that allowed you follow along and foreshadow  Yet even at its end  Hawkins throws in another twist  lengthening my intrigue and appreciation even after the last page  I wanted to not like this book  I resisted reading it  But once I started  I was hooked  and couldn t stop  A shocking  fast paced thriller that can t be missed The girl on the train follows a young woman called Rachel  every day she takes the same train and observes the same couple  sometimes she even feels like she knows them personally  However one day she sees something shocking and everything is turned upside down  This psychological thriller is different than every book I have read before  most of the time there is at least one person in a book that you like  here this is not the case  every character is absolutely terrible  In this case  it actually worked in advantage of the story  Every tiny part of the story was well plotted  as well as the character development was very well done  The story worked very addictive  I wasn t able to put it down  However after I read approximately half of the book I started to expect the ending  the ending itself felt a little flat and cut short in my opinion  Which is too bad because it did disappoint me a little bit after such a great story  All in all  I think the plot is great  original and very addictive  The story itself is amazingly written  the twists and turns fit exactly  Only the ending didn t fully satisfy me  which doesn t mean that I didn t like it at all  I would love to read more from this author   Nobody to root for in this book  but the mystery is pretty good  How is it possible to despise every character in a book and still like the story  Perhaps that s the wonder of The Girl on the Train    Each character is fatally flawed  None has any redeeming characteristics and  yet  they come together in a well timed  tensely paced  suspenseful and dark plot that slowly and tantalizingly pulls the reader into its web  A real page turner  Wow  That was like being on an intense roller coaster  Or being caught in the eye of tornado  Or being inside a twisted ball of yarn  What an incredible story   Another book filled with unsavoury characters and liars  I couldn t warm to them  Even the Police Family Liaison Officer was a sneering bitch  BUT the main monologue from Rachel rings true  full of self doubt and self loathing and boozy blackouts  A few twists and turns  and a red herring  I enjoyed it  This was right up my alley and will likely be among my favorite thrillers this year  Damaged characters galore  and some you can t help but have sympathy for   internal dialogue that had me highlighting and a plot that makes you think about how quick we are to judge people and how little we really know about them  There are a few things i would change but overall it was a quick and creepy read  I don t generally tolerate books very well that move from present to past regularly  Nor do I usually like for the  narrator  to switch from one character to another  Both of these characteristics were in  The Girl on the Train  and it did not bother me in the least  It took a little bit of time to really get into the story but that may have been because I had limited time to listen  audio version  at any given time  The farther into the story  the more intense and involved the story line became and was definitely in thriller mode towards the end  It being the audio version  I really l liked hearing the book with the British accents  Really enjoyed this one  My family likes to play a  game  when we go camping  At state parks  campers come with their tents  trailers  pets and camp chairs  We call our game  Sociology   We try to guess what the campers around us do for their day jobs  what their life situation is or is not  We rarely find out if our guesses are good or not  but in The Girl on the Train  the lead character starts the story out by imagining what the lives are like of a couple she sees from the train stop  She then becomes involved with the couple as the story is actually told by three different characters  Well written different points of view  I was able to figure out who the bad guy was early on but kept thinking there would be another twist but my guess was correct   I m really proud of myself for figuring it all out less than halfway through the book  I m not normally good at that  but I managed it with this one  I can see why it s so popular  It sucked me in  even though I don t normally read psychological thrillers  4 5 starsNormally  I would have read this so much quicker A definite page turner  I started to figure it out close to the end  But even still it kept me turning those pages What a messed up bunch of characters Everyone has a story  that s true I would love to see this made into a movie   Acho que consigo entender o alarido a volta deste livro  Nao foi excelente  mas foi um bom livro  Por isso  posso dizer que gostei dele 3 5   a page turner but I was expecting a better ending from all the hype around this book xD An unusual and initially unsympathetic central character in Rachel  who ticks none of the usual boxes  But nobody is who they seem at first  and much else is also in dispute  including what really happened during Rachel s alcohol induced blackouts  It s one of these blackouts that forms the central mystery here and keeps you turning those pages  A very original story  great setting  lots of suspense with characters that stick in your head   ly bwd  yn khtb z m dwd khtb hy sbkh jnyyh khh khwshm wmd zsh  wq  t ryf hyy khh shnydh

not suggest this book to people who like fluff  The story keeps you on your toes until the very end   Great read  suspenseful and twisty like Gone Girl  Ever wondered what it would feel like to step into the shoes of a couple whom you have admired from afar  in fact  ever wondered what it would be like to get entangled in a disappearance and murder case the likes of which you have only read about or watched on TV so far Well  this novel is about all this  and more  It is the equivalent of a murder mystery cum psychological thriller cum suspense drama  and embedded in it is a wonderful testament to the idea that voyeurism can yield rich and interesting content  So we have Rachael  the classic unreliable narrator   but one with the added twist of being an alcoholic  drunkenly slipping from one disastrous encounter to the other  Can her narration really be taken at face value  especially as she suffers from blackouts and memory losses and a host of other problems  Well  the layers to the novel just make it more interesting  it is not a typical whodunit neither is it a meandering tale into the inner workings of a specific character s mind  Instead it is fast paced human drama and written from the points of view of 3 characters  all of them equally slippery and ambiguous  Beneath the particulars of the story itself is the larger inquiry into the enduring question of whether we say what we see and hear or what we feel and remember  A page turner  a gripping thriller with twists and turns on every page and an interesting insight into relationships  this book is a must read and a collectible   Read this over a weekend with my bookclub friends  Fast paced  well done  Good  not great  Hard to like the characters   This novel is climbing the best seller charts and is creating a lot of buzz  It is likely to be made into a movie as well  All this talk about the book made me order it right away The story is intriguing  Rachel is a mess  She got divorced two years ago when her husband  Tom  left her for another woman  She finds it hard to blame him for the divorce  She was a drunkard and out of control  Any man in his sane mind would be disgusted with her  Her drinking problem made her lose her job  She lives with a school friend  Cathy  She cannot afford to let Cathy know that she has lost her job  for the fear of being turned out of the room she rents in Cathy s flat So  she makes a daily trip to London on the train  keeping up a pretense of going to work  The problem is  the train stops at Witney station  This is where she used to live with Tom  and where Tom now lives with Anna  his new wife  She lives with the pain of passing by her old house every day  She finds herself fixating on another house close to hers  and often looking at a handsome young couple on their terrace Rachel makes up stories about this golden couple  and calls them Jess and Jason  She is convinced that they live an ideal life  full of love and laughter  Until one day when she discovers that the wife is missing  She catches the story in the papers and thinks she has a clue as to who killed her  from what she had seen on the terrace one day She goes to see the police  and tell them what she knows  She also falls back into obsessing about her ex husband  and spirals more and more out of control  falling into an irreversible pattern of drinking She finds herself pursuing the mystery of the missing woman and getting more and more into a mess The story is told in the voices of three women  Rachel  Anna and Megan  the missing woman   The story draws you in immediately  and  despite its dark tone  you find it is hard to let it go The women dominate the novel  the voice and the opinion is all theirs  Even the police  who are investigating the mystery  seem to be rather subdued  If the women had not kept stirring the issue up with their actions  I am afraid  the mystery of missing Megan would have dwindled away in case files The book has been compared to Gillian Flynn s  Gone Girl   Both books are full of dark  damaged characters  But there is hardly any other resemblance  The Girl on the Train is definitely not a copycat novel  In fact  I liked it much more than  Gone Girl  The novel moves at a steady pace  Two or three suspects are insinuated at so we may keep wondering about the culprit  I am afraid I kind of  saw  who the villain was  But even so  it was hard to imagine the  why  of the action  The end was a lot more dark than I anticipated  and I went away from the book feeling rather depressed It was a satisfying read  and one I would surely recommend to all  We already know I m a sucker for unreliable  multiple  and awful narrators  so clearly this book was made with me in mind  But it s a really great work of suspense  with danger at every turn and terrible decisions being made and that sense of never knowing which way is up in the narrative  And for all that the narrators are terrible people  I really wanted things to work out for all of them read more    Omg I finally finished it  this was twisters  I can see how it s compared to   gone girl   It took months to finish it because I was never in mood to be disturbed by the characters  Not one character appealed to me throughout the book  so it was hard to make myself read  But I get all the hype  this is a good thriller  well written and utterly surprising  I m glad I made myself finish it   good  not amazing I approach reading a book such as The Girl on the Train with all the hype surrounding it in a state of both excitement and trepidation  With promises that it s going to be one of the year s best books  I read the book with this expectation hovering over me  I really wanted to love it  to be able to proclaim my agreement with the horn tooters and prophets  It was interesting to see if I would fall in with those who proclaim its genius or those who failed to be smitten  This one had me lingering in the land of suspended opinion for pretty much the first half of the book  I genuinely disliked all the characters and found the three major women narrators either weak or bitchy  However  there is one measure of a novel s effectiveness that cannot be denied  Did I need to keep reading to see what happens  Did I stay up late reading to fulfill that need as quickly as possible  The answers to both questions are  yes   so I have to conclude that the story is a compelling one  and the deeply flawed characters are paramount to the success of the plot  The whole crazy setup works  and the characters do evolve  Of course  the fact that I have a fascination with trains and a long standing curiosity about what is going on in houses that I pass either on a train or car enhanced the method in which the story unfolds  My voyeurism was born watching Rear Window  where watching the daily routines of neighbors proved chillingly exciting and deadly  Not surprisingly  Hawkins  book has been described as having Hitchcockian flair Rachel Watson is about as sad a sack as can be  and the only real interest she has in life is watching the lives of others out of the train window as she travels from a small suburb of London into the city itself  Alcoholism and obsession are the constants of her life  and moving on from a devastating divorce seems an elusive step for her  As a distraction from her pain and decline  Rachel has become fixated on one couple in particular during her daily commute and has named them Jason and Jess  the perfect couple  The train s signal stop enables Rachel to witness Jason and Jess having coffee on their back terrace in the mornings  and she becomes emotionally invested in the scene playing out before her  And  then Rachel s image of her perfect couple gets slammed by reality  as interactions Rachael witnesses in her train watching spill over into a drama of a missing woman  The often incoherent state of black out in which Rachel finds herself proves to land her right in the middle of this suburban drama as she strives to remember vital information  The police consider her an unreliable witness when she reports on what she s seen from her couple watching  As Rachel desperately searches for answers  the lines between lies and truth blur  and the tension of the story winds tighter and tighter Paula Hawkins uses three alternating narrators  three women at the heart of the story  with Rachel s voice being the prominent one  This approach allows the reader to understand how very little is as it seems  It works toward the climax of the different perspectives coming together in a chilling reveal  I started out stating that I didn t like the characters  meaning I wouldn t pick them as people to be in my life  but it doesn t mean that the characters didn t do their job well  While it won t be my favorite book of the year and isn t an  it  book for me  it was a good read that hit on my  Rear Window  sense of thrill   nao e o fenomeno que fazem dele  mas e uma boa leitura     This book sucked me in and I couldn t put it down  I wanted to know what was going to happen  I had some assumptions in the beginning that proved to be correct  but I wasn t disappointed  I read it in two days  Our book club is going to have a lot to talk about tonight   So good  Really creepy  but the twists are well done   It s a shade or two too complicated to be the basis for a Lifetime Movie  but I couldn t help thinking this is how things actually would go down if a real life amateur  sleuth  got involved in a mystery  Think Nancy Drew as a blackout drunk divorcee with no skills to recommend her the job but a stalker s gift for obsession and rationalization  It s not as funny as you might expect given those parameters  Or at all  But I enjoyed it  Sucked me right in  Took it everywhere I went and read in between every free moment  I love a good thriller    This book was a better than most in that there are three different female protagonists each of which overlaps in time place and interlinked roles and there is a clear and  most all of the time  suspenseful weaving of preception  recall and or confused remembrance of  what  and why  who donnit  didit   The prespective and perception is indeed that of a modern  rashomon effect  with homage to the quite original version    see also  if you are unfamiliar with the truly classic Japaneese tale  this link  https   en wikipedia org wiki Rashomo   What is not as well known is that Robert Browning wrote a very captivating long dramatic  verse novel poem  that is a strong complex renaissance intrigue worth a reference https   en wikipedia org wiki The_Rin   This murder is truly most foul but the meandering recounting of crime motive and suspects by the three voices as both parts of the events and its witness es  is both creatively and powerfully concocted and revealed We listened to the story on audio tape so each of the three overlapping internal monologues was read acted by a completely different female actor  Really contributed to the telling of the tale It really worked and kept our attention throughout    NO SPoilers here       There are many excellent reviews of this book on Goodreads so I m going to forgo any attempt to summarise the plot of this best selling thriller  Suffice to say  it tracks a series of events through the eyes of three women  whose lives interlink with tragic consequences  Cleverly  and very effectively  the tale is told through the ever switching view of each of the three women  This variation in perspective created a level of tension that didn t let up   well  not until the drawn out final section of the book  which is probably its least satisfying element  We are introduced to normal  even enviable  people leading conventional  satisfying lives  Except  it gradually becomes apparent that their lives are actually unsettled  complex and somewhat claustrophobic  The people we accepted as happy and normal to start with begin to look troubled and manipulative as they succumb to an environment filled with lies and mistrust  This transition is executed very well  with subtle hints growing into certainty through the introduction  at first  of small details that create doubt and suspicion in the eyes of the reader  It s great fun and very voyeuristic As has been widely reported  the book has clear echo s of  Gone Girl but I think it also has elements of the old Hitchcock film Rear Window  I liked the Englishness of it  a contrast to my predominant diet of American literature  And the tale was intriguing  with a mood that  if I had to compare it with anything  reminded me of the BBC series Broadchurch   no shame in that  Overall I found it to be an ingenious and well written piece  just slightly let down by its protracted climax   A suspenseful thriller  Very well written  It did remind me of Gone Girl  except the author allowed us to empathize with most of her characters  In Gone girl one simply abhorred the characters because of their sheer evilness  I am not much into thrillers but I really enjoyed reading this  The characters are very well developed      One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl  four for a boy  five for silver  six for gold  seven for a secret never to be told I ve got a few of those    What is it about lies and schemes that excites us so much  Is our kind really so masochistic that we d rather live in a lie rather than give it up and move on for something real  Are we really so blind that we can t see one feet in front of us  Can we really not see the lie sparkling in their eye  Or are we just pretending that we do not see so that the delusion can keep working out just fine and at the same time hoping that the lie goes away  Books like this  they change the way I see people  I feel like I m always so trusty and quick to judge someone before I ve witnessed all of their sides and I really want to stop being that person who will always be trying to find the good in every single person in my life  even those of small importance to me  Well  this kind of books  books like this and Gone Girl which I m sure most of you have read  they change my perspective towards what I see and how I see it  We ve all witnessed someone passing by and think  wow  this one seems like a real good person  or see a couple and say  they re cute  they ll be together forever   And what you don t know is that maybe this real good person you saw might have been a drug dealer  and maybe that cute couple you saw on the road  maybe the one is abusing the other or contemplating ways to bash in their head while lying asleep in the bed  Don t let appearances deceive you  Do not trust easily  Rachel is a drunk  No shit  She s drunk most of the time  Every day she wakes up  pretends that she goes to work  says so to her flatmate because she hasn t told her that she was fired because of her excessive drinking  takes the 8 04 train and goes to her ex husband s house where he lives with his wife and their child  The child she was never able to give to him  She s one of those people  I m sure you ve seen them  you may be one of them too  that they look at everything  scrutinizing you from top to bottom  She s even noticed a couple  just 4 5 houses down the house she and her husband used to live  and she s created those fictional names for them and she imagines how they re living a wonderful life  full of roses and romance and candlelit dinners at nights  Until one morning she sees that woman kissing another man on the mouth  Her dream for the perfect couple being in existence got shattered The woman  the one Rachel was fantasizing that she and her husband were leading the perfect life  well  she goes missing  the same day she saw her kissing that other man  The thing is  next morning she wakes up and while she can feel something is unmistakably wrong  she can t put her finger on it  She was drunk and she had a blackout  she s sure of it  But what happened between those moments of the blackout  What did she witness  The thing about this book is that it s gripping and it s twisty and has many fucked up characters  my favorite kind  I love my characters fucked up with tons of issues and why not drinking problems  I did not want to put this book down  Mrs  Hawkins knows how to tell a story  Creepy and fucking twisted  at that  But still a great story with plot twists and tons of suspense and angst going on in its entirety I m recommending this to anyone who loves a good thriller  And certainly to those who enjoyed Gone Girl  One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl       Three for a girl  I m stuck on three  I just can t get any further  My head is thick with sounds  my mouth thick with blood  Three for a girl  I can hear the magpies  they re laughing  mocking me  a raucous cackling  A tiding  Bad tidings  I can see them now  black against the sun  Not the birds  something else  Someone s coming  Someone is speaking to me  Now look  Now look what you made me do     I love reading this book and not knowing what or whom I can trust or rely upon  I enjoy flawed characters  and this book contains nothing but  The characters are fairly flat  but I think that is a product of the book being told entirely through limited perspectives  it makes sense  given the structure  for readers to need to round the characters out ourselves  The book also moves very quickly for one that winds into such dark places in these flawed minds I did feel like the ending came too abruptly  or perhaps with a little too much clarity regarding the big mystery and problem of the novel  That said  I appreciated the sense of life going on without suddenly becoming better after the climax Overall  the book is a good read  and I enjoyed it immensely  If you want a protagonist  or indeed any character  you completely like or admire  or if you want a feel good story  this is not the book for you  If you want to think through the story and explore some dark and sometimes depressing parts of human nature  I highly recommend it  This book was suspenseful and kept me reading until the end  Worth reading  A lot of people have compared this book to Gone Girl  I will have to say I did not like Gone Girl but I did like this book  It was intriguing and did have the feel of complication Gone Girl had in the crime but while Gone Girl did not have a single redeemable character this novel has characters who are flawed but they have some redeeming qualities as well  This was a much cleaner  and more intriguing story on my opinion  It was a quick read  it held my interest and I enjoyed the writing style  Definitely one I would recommend  Very comparable to  Gone Girl   Strong female lead characters  intertwining stories  and extremely suspenseful up until the very last pages  Highly recommend for anyone who binges on thriller novels and likes dark plots  Por Dios  no se ni por donde empezar  Sera por aclarar que es un 4 5Este libro me encanto a pesar de que por rato la protagonista me parecia patetica  y con poca dignidad   Como se fue desarrollando la trama  como fue Rachel contando su historia desde el punto B al Y  y dandonos los flashbacks y experiencias del punto A  como empezo todo   Me mantuvo pegado a el  desde que paso lo que paso  y aunque ya empezaba a sospechar  no fue nada comparado con lo que ocurrio en realidad mas bien a como se desarrollo el enfrentamiento final  Mientras tenia mi pausa en el trabajo estaba leyendo y llevaba poco mas de la mitad  no queria parar  pero debia  Al llegar a casa  me he puesto con el y segun  mnna lo terminaba pero no he podido soltarlo mas hasta el final  Al final la chica de tren  ha sido de las grandes lecturas que he hecho este 2015 respecto a este genero   miles de cosas que hacer y no pude parar de leer  me encantan los personajes desquiciados y este libro tenia de sobra Rachel  Megan y Anna  Las tres narradoras del libro tienen su personalidad  distinta la una de la otra y se va conformando la historia  Ellas llevan el peso de la trama y lo hacen de una manera muy genialRachel  divorciada de Tom  Alcoholica  Viaja todos los dias en el tren de las 08 04 y pasa por lo que era su ex vecindario por lo que siempre esta atenta al pasar por ahi Megan  Casada  Desempleada  Tiene problemas con su pasado y no sabe lidiar con ellos  Vive en el ex vecindario de Rachel Anna  Nueva esposa de Tom   fue su amante cuando estaba casado con Rachel    Tiene una hija con este  Odia a Rachel  Desempleada  Entre estas tres mujeres se va conformando la trama y vemos que va pasando entre ellas y como se desarrolla esta historia  a partir de la desaparicion de una de ellas  El libro es muy rapido de leer  no podia parar  This is the debut novel of Paula Hawkins who has turned over to writing thrillers after 25 years of journalism  It s a classic whodunnit story made interesting by unreliable narrators  The plot is as follows  the main narrator Rachel takes the same train for her daily commute to town  Everyday as the train stops at a particular signal Rachel peeps into the houses and the lives of the people that live across the track  She becomes obsessed with the life of inhabitants of one such house number 15  The couple whom she has named Jess and Jason seem to be in love and lead a perfect life from her vantage point and she wishes for her own life to be just like that  Trouble starts once when she sees Jess kissing someone other than Jason from the train  Rachel whose past life is fraught with issues decides to confront Jess or Jason  Later Jess disappears and Rachel gets entangled in the mess  Rachel is an alcoholic and there are huge gaps in her recollection of events which adds up the mystery content of the story  Since the cast is small  after the disappearance it s pretty easy to figure out who the culprit can be and then you are just waiting for the big reveal  You are only interested in the how of it and not the who since once you eliminate the red herrings there is only one character left who could possibly do it  That s the only reason I thought parts of the book dragged a bit but overall it s a fun read  This book played out well on audio for me I wish that book critics and marketers would stop comparing every thriller to Gone Girl  It s not really fair to the authors in this genre who are trying to tell their own stories in their own ways In Hawkins  debut novel  Hawkins weaves a tale about a lonely  jealous alcoholic woman and two happily married couples  when  oh  oh   one of the 3 women in this circle goes missing  How the lives of all 3 women intersect and what it means to the  who done it  tale provided a pretty good romp for me on audio  I like that Hawkins tried to go different places with her storytelling  and I appreciated her pursuit of standing apart from many other books in this genre  I think that she was successful  which isn t easy to do  especially because of Gone Girl  but Hawkins does a nice job  especially with what I found to be a very satisfying ending Overall  I recommend this book  The story here actually read like a train  Started out purposefully chugging along  caught my attention right away  and then built faster and faster  Enjoyed the story  I found the concept really unique and it was definitely a compelling thriller  4 stars because I did not find it as unpredictable as I think was intended   certainly still enjoyed the story but I had an idea where it was headed  Despite the fact that I absolutely could not stand the narrator  this plot really kept me hooked and quickly turning the pages  The last 100 pages were by far the best part   A debut psychological thriller that will forever change the way you look at other people s lives  Well not quite  but that was part of the reason I liked The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  The story is told through the eyes of three women  Rachel  the girl on the train  is a messed up drunk who can t let go of Tom  her cheating ex husband who dumped her for another woman  Anna is the other woman  now a mother  who has moved into Tom s home which Rachel repeatedly visits and phones in hopes of getting Tom back  And Megan is the woman down the street who is having an affair of her own Every day  Rachel rides the train from her new home to London and each day the train stops within sight of her old home and Megan s  Rachel fantasizes about Megan and her husband and the happy life they must live until one day she witnesses Megan kissing another man  Shortly after Megan goes missing  Rachel  unreliable  drunken Rachel involves herself in the case and tries to sort out fleeting memories of drunken episodes that may have some bearing on the case  That is the thriller part But for me the best part was all the inter relations that add to the mystery  Tom and Rachel  Anna and Rachel  Megan and her therapist among others This isn t great literature but if you are looking for something to amuse and pass the time  you can t go wrong with this one   Finished in an afternoon Couldn t stop reading once I started  I finished the book in one day and it was great  For the first time in a long time in was surprised by the ending of a book    Really it s more a 3 5 5  Throughout most of the book  I d say about 3 4 of the way  I was prepared to give this 4 and even 4 5 5 stars  However  once the book climaxed  it was kind of predictable  It still had some very good twists and turns  don t get wrong  I was definitely captivated by the writing  the character development and it was so vivid I could picture everything perfectly as it played out  I felt like a voyeur while reading   like something out of a Hitchcock movie a la Rear Window  I felt ashamed and crazy for defending and siding with some of the characters who were just a crazy mess  I loved and hated the characters  which I think is part of the appeal  So overall  this was a great read and I m very glad I read it  I definitely recommend it  Te pone en una sola angustia desde el principio y te mantiene alterada casi todo el libro  en mi caso desee que todos murieran  wow  talk About a wild ride  3 5 4 stars for me  The story began a little slow for me but I kept going because i knew there was a thrill somewhere  It kept me guessing the entire time about all of the characters and I couldnt figure out who did it so when it happened i was def surprised BUT i dont feel like it flowed well  The shock of who the guilty was seriously came out of no where and I cant figure out if i liked it or not  It really didnt fit that character at all  at least not the way the author wrote it  Also  I felt terrible for the main character  her story is so sad  But that s just it  she s a sad character  By the end of the book  I was more annoyed with her than sad for her  Pitty turned into annoyance as she just happened to remember what she had seen  Not just that but technically she didnt see anything so i didnt feel she was important to the case aside from the fact that she was desperate for    i dont want to say attention but desperate for something  there were so many loose ends here  so many  like  what happened to the therapist  did the fact that she saw him help her in any way  So was her husband like that the entire time they were together  what is real and what was made up by him  what happened to scott  he was so important to the book then he just fell off  what was the point of the encounter with the red haired man on the train  the fact that rachel is an alcoholic really made me feel for the girl but at the same time i couldnt tell in the end what was what  who was the missing with when she said  this is the last time  the therapist or the husband  see what i mean  so many questions that didnt lead to the end but didnt give me any closure  over all it was a 4 star because it kept my attention through the whole thing and a week later here i am still thinking about it   I have mixed feelings about this book  Reading from an unreliable narrator can be thrilling as well as annoying because you really want to get to the bottom of things but you can t even trust what she s saying and it s frustrating at times but you also find yourself sympathizing for being the way she is  This is all about Psychology people and I pat myself on the back for getting the right character to blame for the mysterious death   I give this book 3 5 5 stars  This book was an extremely quick read and was very easy to jump back into after putting it down  no matter what s going on around you aka this is a good book to read on a train  It was a decent thriller that I didn t figure out until right before the big reveal    but I also wasn t super curious to find out what the big reveal actually was  Was the book engaging while it was in my hands  Yes  Was it dominating my thoughts whenever I wasn t reading it as I want mysteries to do  No  Will I remember the details of this book two months from now  Probably not  I ve never seen a title on GoodReads be reviewed by so many of my friends  aside from the Harry Potter series maybe  so obviously there s something in this book that captivates a large number of people  side note  this article detailing the book s wild success on GoodReads is worth a read of its own   I bumped it up on my To Read list because of a strong sell from a friend and because a promo photo of Emily Blunt starring in the film version was released  This book will be talked about a lot so I m happy to have read it so I can participate in discussions with peers  but overall  I kind of wish this girl  me  had picked a different book to read on the train   An exceptional first novel that I truly could not put down  Yes  there are legitimate comparisons to Rear Window and Gone Girl but this story stands on its own as a very entertaining read  I look forward to more by Paula Hawkins   Whoa damn  This was good  The last 1 3 of the novel was pretty intense  It s been a while since I ve read a book like this   a female centric thriller  I would definitely recommend it  So first of all  I think it s worth noting that I read this book in one day  Well  I read the first 40 pages on Saturday night and the rest throughout Sunday  So basically one day  In other words  either it was really good or I just really didn t want to do my homework  Maybe a little bit of both I ve been hearing about this book all over the place   it s topping bestselling lists everywhere  it s being called  the next Gone Girl   and my mom read it within a couple days and told me I would like it  So finally  after I d just finished a hefty 500  page epic fantasy the day before  I thought I d give The Girl on the Train a shot To give you a short synopsis in case you re not already familiar  The Girl on the Train follows three women  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  who are brought together  although not always consciously  by ex husbands  commuter trains into London  and illegal activity  The timeline jumps between present and past as the three women s stories intertwine and a mystery unravels  That s really all I want to say without giving anything away  I would recommend going into this book without knowing much more I ve heard a lot of people say they were disappointed because they went in expecting the next Gone Girl and got something completely different  However  I think it s important to recognize that no book is really  the next  anything  Unless you count Fifty Shades of Grey  which was based off of Twilight fanfiction and was therefore pretty accurately  the next Twilight  upon its release  Basically  what I m trying to say is that The Girl on the Train was completely different from Gone Girl or any other psychological thriller I ve read  but I totally get why the two are being compared  The Girl on the Train deals with rocky marriages  unreliable narrators  and apparent mental illness in a way that so far I ve only seen matched in Gillian Flynn s work The characters  in this case  were more believable for me than those in Gone Girl  and I promise I ll stop comparing this to Gone Girl now   All five of the central characters arguably suffer from some sort of mental illness  and I think Hawkins grasps this in such an authentic way  When a character was anxious or manic  I felt my pulse race and my reading speed up  When a character was depressed  the reading got slower and I found myself inwardly channeling written emotions  Also  the way Hawkins wrote the thoughts of a character suffering from alcohol addiction felt so incredibly real to me  despite never having suffered from addiction  myself  None of the characters were particularly likeable  they all had their inner demons  but I found myself relating to them all at one point or another This book doesn t have a particularly dense plot  sometimes I would read 40 or 50 pages and discover that nothing of value had really happened  While this would normally frustrate me  I found that it really didn t in this case  Even though actual things weren t taking place  the characters  inner dialogues and stress over uncovering the truth kept me intrigued throughout I really need to mention the setting of this novel  because it felt so incredibly real  This might be because I spent three months living in London and could therefore picture exactly what a community on the city s outskirts would look like  I could also relate to Rachel s obsession with  Jason and Jess  during her morning and evening commutes because I often found myself picking out the same houses again and again during the over ground legs of my journeys  I actually got chills once in a while when I would recognize the names of train stations or supermarkets  Also  I kept getting pretty strong Broadchurch vibes  for obvious reasons if you re familiar with the show Basically  this was just a really cool book  Not very literary  but definitely thought provoking  It puts you inside the minds of people you may not normally associate with and make them seem more human than they might have otherwise Needless to say  while this book is not Gone Girl  if you re a fan of Gillian Flynn or simply of psychological thrillers  I would definitely recommend this  This review was originally posted on my blog at https   alireadsbooks wordpress com 2     So this is the IT book everyone is talking about  If you looked at the NYT bestseller list  you would maybe expect something mind blowing and  Gone Girl esque    By the way  GG is doomed to be the generic term for anything twisty  Just like every Scandinavian thriller had The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in its blurb  Please   But Gone Girl it isn t  What it IS is a fast paced  entertaining debut novel that hit the right buttons at the right time  It is written in a slightly sneaky way that is suspenseful and a tad twisty  Most of the characters are pathetic  awful creatures that are hard to like and hard to stomach for 336 pages  I mean  the protagonist is an overweight alcoholic that is so lonely she inserts herself into the lives of people she has seen from the train into and out of London  By the end of the book  I suppose I had a small amount of sympathy for her  The book excels in this way   characters that are larger than life  The story is not exceptionally smart or clever  but that is OK  It is a fun ride  and should make for a good discussion at book club It has been optioned for a movie already  to be developed by Marc Platt  Drive  Into the Woods   I m curious about how this will turn out  simply because the edge  or the hook if you will  is how much of the narrative is shadowed from specifics  and leaves the reader to fumble around in the dark trying to determine who is to be trusted and who is doing what I would definitely recommend this one  just keep your expectations in check   Trilling  compulsive and gripping  The story revolves around three women  Rachel  Anna and Megan Rachel  an alcoholic depressed soul  after her break up with her husband Tom  Anna  the young woman whom Tom choose over Rachel  Megan  who always cheated and ran away from her life rather then facing them  Whom will you trust or like  None of them are perfect  All in a complete mess Rachel lost her husband and job too  But still catches the 8 04 slow train from Ashbury to Euston pretending to go to office  The trains stops at the same signal  overlooking a row of back gardens  There she always see a couple sitting at the patio or the makeshift terrace  She makes her imaginary story of those couple  Jess and Jason  as they are perfect  They are beautiful  happy and peaceful together  They are the perfect couple  All that she is not But on one of the Fridays  her perfect couple image of Jess and Jason breaks  She could not take it  She is so disturbed  And the very next night Jess is missing  Now she cannot be just a girl on the train  She wants to help Jason  When she takes the decision  she comes to face the bitter reality Anna  who is suspicious about her husband  She has the feeling that her husband Tom still has clandestine relation with his ex  Rachel  She starts checking Tom s mails in his absence to find a proof  She wants to be happy with her family with Tom and her daughter Evie  With Rachel gone for ever from their lives Megan  the beautiful  pretty women of Rachel s imaginary story  Jess  She has secrets to keep  She is restless  With her art gallery gone  there is nothing much for her to keep her busy  She wants a purpose in life  She is looking for distractions  She always runs away from her situations  She decides for once to make her life right  To do every thing that is right  And what fate does she meets for being straight and true and right  Mukemmel   Polisiye okumayi gercekten cok seviyorum  Okurken o hissettigim gerginlik  bir seyleri cozmek icin kafa yormam    Bu kitap bana bu duygulari yasatti  Karakterler ve kurgu cok iyiydi  Tek sikinti katil olayinin biraz kisa tutulmus olmasi  Ben o bolumde daha cok gerilim  daha cok tartisma bekliyordum  I really couldn t figure it out until the end    And love that  I can t remember the last time I read an entire book in a day  This was tasty brain candy  even if I guessed the culprit pretty early on  And I enjoyed that the protagonist wasn t some gorgeous  brilliant model type  but a deeply flawed and somewhat unreliable person  A good thriller  It does not pay to cheat on your spouse   fatal attraction vs gone girl  Crazy killer spouse   I read this in the RV on an impromptu road trip with my parents I think this was an overall good thriller  It s one of those rare different P O V novels that actually is well put together and used effectively to give the reader limited information  therefore giving off that mysterious vibe  Granted I haven t read many different P O V novels  but from what I know I think Hawkins did a pretty good job juggling with the characters The characters were well written  well written as in unreliable and untrustworthy but hey whatever makes a story more interesting  I felt myself sympathizing with the lead but also getting frustrated with her continuous addictive behaviours  but this goes to show how well Hawkins has portrayed the reality of being an alcoholic  There was no sugar coating in her actions and how there was always going to be harsh consequences for it  One thing that threw me off was definitely  view spoiler   the plot twist  I mean near the end I was able to piece it together because Dr  Kamal and Scott would have been too obvious as the killer  I guess it was the lack of Anna s P O V in earlier parts of the book so that we couldn t see more of Tom s normal behaviours  or lack thereof  I mean Tom cheated for crying out loud  that should ve been the biggest red flag that he s a deceiving son of a b tch but I was pulled into Rachel s self pity that I was blinded from it as well   hide spoiler  Looking for a light medium read and a good thriller  This is the one  you ll be turning the pages so fast Anyone has some recommendations that are similar to this book  Maybe not similar but some good thrillers mysteries novels in general p s  idk where all the hate comes from tbh  If you genuinely disliked it just talk about what and why you didn t like it  but don t start acting pretentious and put people down for enjoying a book that someone has put effort into writing  Many people gave it 4 5 stars for a reason  it means they liked it and found it interesting  And if you found problems with the characters then that means Hawkins did a good job at portraying realistic versions of people in the world  ya ll must be so fun at parties  going on and on about how much you hate a book   OMG DO NOT READ THIS BOOK  IT SUCKS SO BAD  LIKE IDK WHAT THE AUTHOR WAS THINKING WHEN THEY WROTE THIS  SUCH A WASTE OF MY TIME  I WANT TO KILL MYSELFQKOTJNWIGKA YWRLEHM   I enjoyed this book for its ability to suck you into the story from the very beginning and keep you guessing to the very end I enjoy books with an unreliable narrator and compared to Gone Girl which I found really juvenile and the twist easy to pick early on  this book was a lot more sophisticated in its execution It s a fun read when you re in the mood for something less taxing on the brain than the most recent literary prize winner s new novel 3 and a half stars  I gave this a 4 because it was a captivating  quick read  I like fast books that make me want more and more and more  That being said I felt like I was alongside Rachel most of the time trying to figure it all out  And  about 75  of the way I did figure out that it was Tom  I was both happy and not happy  Because I figured it out and really wanted a zinger in the end  I do have questions Was Megan never sleeping with the shrink and that was Tom  If so  the author did a good job confusing the reader  Or  did she have an affair with both I had a hard time figuring out Anna  I really didn t like her  I always rooted for Rachel  And  Megan was 50 shades of messed up But  I guess my favorite thing was that you really can t judge a book by its cover  Rachel sees Megan as a perfect person while on the train  But  we all know that what you see isn t always a reality  So  I thought that was fantastic Additionally  I thought that Rachel had so  so  so many issues    but it was good to know that she wasn t mean or nasty  She just had been screwed by Tom         I kind of want to re read the end because I just read it last night  SFIDA TRA ROMANZI VINCITORIQuesto veloce romanzo e molto realistico e piacevole  pero non posso negare che mi abbia in parte deluso  L ho acquistato quando era primo in classifica e tutti lo elogiavano  Mi ero creato aspettative troppo alte  Nonostante la vittoria su goodreads come miglior thriller del 2015  non e stato il  MIO thriller dell anno   Per me lo e stato  Gone girl  vincitore dello stesso premio nel 2012  La ragazza del treno appartiene al genere thriller psicologico  che sembra essere diventato una moda   La regina dei castelli di carta   Il senso di Smilla per la neve   Gone Girl  L elenco potrebbe diventare molto lungo  Lo stile  sicuramente fluido e veloce  mi sembra in ritardo  La doppia narrazione  che per quasi tutto il libro alterna il racconto della protagonista Rachel a quello di Megan  sarebbe stata molto originale qualche anno fa  Se vi piace potete ritrovarla ad esempio in  Qualcuno con cui correre   1q84   Gone Girl Dopo aver nominato per ben tre volte  Gone Girl  e inevitabile il confronto  Entrambi sono thriller psicologici  entrambi scritti con la doppia narrazione  entrambi in prima persona  Io ho preferito Gone Girl per lo stile ironico  la sua originalita ed il finale a sorpresa  Molti preferiranno questo thriller per il maggior realismo Un pregio del vincitore 2015 e senza dubbio il realismo  I personaggi sono totalmente realistici  pero  nel mio specifico caso  non sono riusciti a trasmettermi molto simpatia  I personaggi dei thriller di  Micheal Connelly sono realistici al cento per cento e riescono a coinvolgermi  I personaggi di  Paula Hawkins non mi hanno emozionato  ma e solo questione di gusti Il realismo della trama e  un altro punto di forza  Alcuni scrittori di thriller sacrificano il realismo per fare trame piu avvincenti e personaggi piu simpatici  Non  Paula Hawkins  E impossibile trovare un solo punto poco realistico nella trama I temi sono molto attuali  La disoccupazione e l alcolismo sono tematiche importanti  ma ad essere sincero non mi hanno coinvolto molto  Penso sia dovuto ai personaggi per cui non provavo grande trasporto  Se qualche lettore si innamorera di Rachel  sicuramente verra coinvolto da queste importanti tematiche Riprendendo il paragone con  Gone Girl  entrambi hanno il matrimonio fra i loro temi principali   evidenzio una differenza  Le tematiche di Gone Girl sono quasi esclusivamente di natura psicologica  in questo thriller si mescolano invece temi psicologici a temi sociali  L intreccio de  La ragazza del treno non e troppo complicato  Ho indovinato il colpevole prima del finale  Non mi succede molto spesso  Bisogna sottolineare che nei gialli classici sono presenti molti piu personaggi e sono tutti poco profondi  Nei thriller  al contrario  i personaggi sono in numero minore e sono descritti con molta piu cura  Agatha Christie sembra volerti ingannare  Paula Hawkins sembra invece voler darti una mano  Non che sia scontato indovinare il finale  ho prestato il libro a due amici e nessuno aveva previsto il colpo di scena finale   diciamo che sono stato particolarmente fortunato  O sfortunato  Forse preferisco le volte in cui sbaglio e l autore riesce a sorprendermi  Per esempio  il finale di  Gone Girl mi ha sorpreso  Secondo me chi non indovinera  l identita del colpevole apprezzera maggiormente questo  giallo   A differenza di Gone Girl  consiglio questo thriller anche agli amanti del genere giallo In conclusione  non definirei  La ragazza del treno  un capolavoro  ma un ottimo thriller  molto realistico  attuale e scorrevole  Voto 3 5  Sicuramente un ottima lettura estiva   Premetto dicendo che questa ela prima volta che leggo un giallo e devo dire che le mie aspettative non sono state deluse  anzi  sono stata invogliata a leggere altri libri di questo genere Parlando ora del libro  e completamente diverso da quello che mi aspettavo La lettura mi ha preso molto e sono riuscita a finirlo in due giorni scarsi   Leggevo anche durante il tragitto in metro  giusto per dire che di solito non leggo sui mezzi pubblici  Non voglio fare spoilers e nient altro  tuttavia ci tenevo a dire la mia Ho visto pareri contrastanti su questo libro  di persone che hanno amato la storia e persone che invece non sono state soddisfatte pienamente  se non per nulla  dalle aspettative che si sono create Il libro ha avuto molto successo se teniamo conto di tutte le copie che ha venduto  tuttavia questo non significa che sia un capolavoro  molte volte il successo deriva da una buona pubblicita  passaparola e sicuramente la capacita dell autore di saper catturare un possibile lettore con una trama intrigante e non comune  Non avendo letto altri gialli mi risulta difficile fare confronti con altri libri riguardanti questo genere Per quanto la storia possa essermi piaciuta  tuttavia non riesco a non pensare che una parte di me ha trovato alcune cose un po  banali  Nel senso che  senza rilevare troppo  il colpevole e facilmente individuabile gia da una buona meta del libro  mentre io mi aspettavo di capirlo verso la fine   Ripeto  forse sono io che ho poca dimestichezza con i gialli  I personaggi hanno tutti un profilo interessante e intrigante  cosi tanto che a un certo punto ho iniziato a sospettare che il colpevole potesse essere qualunque tra di loro Consiglio il libro a chi non ha mai letto gialli ma ne potrebbe essere interessato  E stata una buona lettura e non mi pento assolutamente di averla intrapresa  This is a book about a woman who is an alcoholic who rides the train daily  She makes up stories about the people she sees in their homes from the train and then one day is confronted with the fact that she is entwined in their lives problems  I listened to this book and it was really well performed  It was like listening to a movie   I wish that I had picked to read this one instead of listen to it   However  the three women reading it did a great job  I love books filled with suspense  no matter if the answers seem a little obvious or are totally a shock  I love that this book got into the brains and thought processes of Rachel  Megan and Anna  You rarely ever know why people do what they do in real life  but in books it can be shown so well  Anyway  I don t want to say anything about the plot  but I enjoyed it  was a bit on my seat and didn t want to stop listening EDIT   I felt unsatisfied with my initial review  I felt like this was a cross blend of Gone Girl and The Husband s Secret and maybe not as good as either  but maybe I just feel like that because it was not the first book I ve read recently like this  I think sometimes suspenseful books can seen already done when you read enough of them and find too many similarities  However  I really liked that I just wanted to know what the truth was and wanted to get there now  That s why I gave it a 4 star  It doesn t have to be the best  it just has to either make me keep thinking  make me want to just keep reading  or listening in this case  without stopping  or just simply have fantastic content  This rating was based on the middle idea  I ve been looking for a book that would blow me away with its writing and character development  and I finally found one that satisfied me even while it reminded me of an Alfred Hitchcock film with all of its twists and turns  rather appropriate given its title  While I can t say that I was completely surprised by the ending  I enjoyed the journey along the way and the way my trust in one character after another was eroded and then reaffirmed  The characters are complicated  nuanced  imperfect  and have the ability to surprise readers  and it s hard not to imagine what one might do if one were in a particular character s shoes  On the surface  the story seems to revolve around the mental state of Rachel Watson  an alcoholic divorced woman who clings to the slim hope that her ex husband will return to her and whose drinking has caused her to lose her job  So that her housemate won t know the truth  she leaves home every day to ride a commuter train to work  Perhaps because her own life had ended in disappointment  she enjoys starring out the windows at the flats along the way and fantasizing about the couple she often spies from her window  When Megan  the woman she s been watching  disappears one day  Rachel is sure she has information that must be shared with the police  But she suffers from black outs during her drinking bouts  and she cannot remember exactly what she saw on the day of Megan s disappearance  The story would be interesting enough if it were told solely from Rachel s point of view  but because Anna Watson  the wife of Rachel s former husband Tom  offers her take on Rachel and the book s events  it becomes even more intriguing  Add to the mix the voice of Megan  the victim  whose story begins more than a year before Rachel s  and readers are constantly on guard to see when all the competing stories will come crashing together  The author does an excellent job of building some sympathy for all three women while also portraying them in an unadmirable light  Rachel  for instance  needs to stop wallowing in misery  cease drinking  and avoid putting herself in risky situations  Anna needs to find some kindness in her heart and empty it of the hatred and disdain she feels toward Rachel  and Megan needs to stop trying to seduce every male that crosses her path  But truthfully  all three have very good reasons for being the way they are  which still doesn t justify the way they are treated  A couple of other reviewers claimed to despise these three women while I felt sad for them  My disgust and mistrust were sent in another direction  though  and all I can conclude is that what goes around does come around   The ending is what redeemed this book  and probably because of the twist I didn t see coming  The rest of the book was quite slow  and rather frustrating   the characters were infuriating at times  particularly Rachel  for reasons I will not mention to avoid spoiler tagging But  I have to say  the suspense was built well  This book is a real page turner   though I was desperate to discover the truth  and found the book to drag in portions  I was not put off  I still could not wait to pick it up and continue  I still kept reading I did enjoy this  but I almost can not see where the hype stems from  Yes  it is a good thriller  and the twist was unexpected  but    is it not just a well written thriller  Maybe I haven t read enough of this genre to judge  maybe I should read more crime suspense thriller novels before I make such an assumption  but to me  though extremely well and intelligently written  it did not seem to be anything particularly extraordinary However  I do think that The Girl on the Train is a well thought out and executed book  and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone  Though most of the book is slow  the ending is amazing  I was hooked I am glad I read it  A big thanks to my book club for picking The Girl on the Train  Fair warning dear readers  you are either going to really like this book or you are really not going to like this book  in scrolling through the other goodreads reviews  there is not a whole lot of in between on that one  While I understand the comparisons to  Gone Girl  Paula Hawkins definitely occupies a different space in the dark and twisty genre than does Gillian Flynn  Full review on http   paperpossebookblog blogspot co    Wow  That is all I can say  WowThis book definitely messed with my mind in the last 100 pages  This was my first psychological thriller and if this is any indication of what the genre will supply then boy do I wanna read more physiological thrillers  So much was going on and so much was hidden from the reader  reading I felt like I was in this twisting and turing roller coaster full of surprises  And oh goodness the ending of this book    so unexpected  I actually gasped when I read it The characters were one of the many things I both appreciated and disliked  There are three point of views  Rachel  Meghan  and Anna  All of them are the flawed messed up characters that despite their mistakes I enjoyed the reality and honest truth of their situation and their reaction  I will admit I wasn t the hugest fan of Anna and Meghan but I appreciated that in their own ways their were raw  Also Rachel who is an alcoholic and is described as very messed up she was realistic to her situation and her actions were reasonable  These characters are all different and undergo many hardships I loved how they stay true to reality and what it offers to them   Really fascinating symmetry between the three women and two men  As gripping as Gone Girl  Great read and kept me guessing   3 75 stars  As I read this I couldn t help but compare it with Gone Girl  somewhat unfavorably by being the secondly such book in this vein  Again we have unreliable narrators  but these characters are perhaps a bit more relatable than Gone Girls  I enjoyed the intercutting narration  but the coyness of the author with broad pronouns at times becomes a bit annoying and telegraphs  unintentionally  I think  where the story is going  Worth your time  but not world changing  I couldn t put this book down  I just needed to get to the end to figure it out  Great story  fast paced  But to call it  the next gone girl  isn t true  Fell a little short on that promise  Still worth the read though  even skipped the gym to finish it   Just amazing   My heart was literally pounding reading the last 50 pages   This book definitely kept me on the edge of my seat  so many twists and turns that I didn t see coming  I love how awful the characters are and how everyone has their own dark secrets  Constantly compared to Gone Girl because it involves a woman and murder  The Girl On The Train is a very good thriller in its own right  Our main unreliable narrator  Rachel  is an unemployed alcoholic who takes the daily train to town to fool her roommate into thinking she s still working  On one daily stop she sees into the houses of her old neighborhood where her ex Tom now lives with his new wife and former mistress Anna  and their child   but Rachel forms an attachment to a couple down the street that she builds up in her mind as the perfect couple  The plot is set in motion when Rachel observes Megan  of the perfect couple  cheat on Scott  Shortly thereafter  Megan disappears  and Rachel  still drinking heavily and essentially stalking Tom  wakes up with bloodstains and no memory  The other women also get a turn narrating  with similarly unreliable accounts and some time shifting While the surface story is about what happened to Megan  the true mastery of the book is in the psychological insights it offers  The characters are  for the most part  between flawed and terrible  Rachel s growing despair that she tries to tame with alcohol  Anna s jealous paranoia  and ultimately Megan s loneliness  all of these are shown in subtle but powerful ways  Rachel  for example  explains what it s like be too drunk to remember an embarrassing incident   You want to be able to remember it for yourself  to see it and experience it in your own memory  so that   how did you put it    so that it belongs to you    and wants to  scream with the frustration of it  the not knowing  the uselessness of my own brain    Ed   Guilty  The women also agree on one point  the pleasure of control they get from being attractive to a man   That s the thing I like most about it  having power over someone  That s the intoxicating thing    I was enjoying myself too much  Being the other woman is a huge turn on  there s no point denying it  you re the one he can t help but betray his wife for  even though he loves her  That s just how irresistible you are    I never meant for it to go anywhere  I didn t want it to go anywhere  I just enjoyed feeling wanted  I liked the feeling of control  It s an understandable temptation  and it s particularly interesting to see it framed from three very different women Other highlights  sans context   Parents don t care about anything but their children  They are the centre of the universe  they are all that really counts  Nobody else is important  no one else s suffering or joy matters  none of it is real    How much better life must have been for jealous drunks before emails and texts and mobile phones  before all this electronica and the traces it leaves  Recommended   I really dig a good psychological thriller or suspense novel from time to time and this one hit the spot  The writing was fairly straightforward and simple  but alternated between three female narrators  We try to figure out how their stories are intertwined and what the significance of main character Rachel s observations as the  girl on the train   There is a fairly strong storyline and the realistic blurring of lines based on the perspective of a  he said she said  situation  along with patchy memories and alcoholic hazes creates just the right amount of confusion  Unreliable narrators keep the reader guessing just how all the puzzle pieces fit together up until the end  It s hard to trust or bond with this cast of characters and it s hard to know whom to trust  I ll be honest  the ending was a bit strange to me  But it proved fairly satisfying  so this book is one that has my recommendation if you can get past the fragmented accounts of each narrator  Not many books have kept me turning pages like this one did   Menarik mistery nyaPenceritaannya juga bagus  bikin kita gak sabar mo baca terusGak membosankanTapi jangan mengharapkan ada kisah cinta  On the train  the tears come  and I don t care if people are watching me  for all they know  my dog might have been run over  I might have been diagnosed with a terminal illness  I might be a barren  divorced  soon to be homeless alcoholic  The Girl on the Train is a complex mystery with enough suspense to make you keep reading  Now  the characters  on the other hand  Jeez Louise  What a train wreck bunch of individuals  They re all rather flawed and disturbing  the women all suffer from various levels of depression  It s very hard to feel anything towards them besides contempt  Once I got to the end of the story  and everything revealed   why the women obsess the way they do  why they re such emotional basket cases   it all makes sense  But still  I couldn t relate to them simply because I d never let a man have that much power over me  Readers who enjoy mystery suspense novels will eat this book up  so it s high rating on goodreads doesn t surprise me  If you can tolerate the unlikable cast  this book is a worth while read   Better than Gone Girl  J ai beaucoup aime le rythme du livre et le developpement desorganise entre les differentes narrations  Le roman est un bel equilibre entre le mystere et le suspense tendu  parfois legerement morbide   Les doutes de Rachel sur elle meme et sa perception de la realite ajoute a la complexite de son point de vue  Le style est parfait pour rendre les etats d ames des personnages et j ai facilement ete transporte quelques heures dans les vies entremelees ces Londoniens AHA    I guessed it right  Overall  I quite enjoyed this book  although it was filled with unlikable characters and some terrible things    Full review on my blog here  3 This was one twisted book  Not quite sure how I feel about it    PR extraordinaire Alison Barrow knows exactly how to create a buzz surrounding the books she works with  no sooner does she reveal a book than the publishing and blogging worlds go crazy  That is exactly what happened when The Girl on the Train was revealed  with one of the best proof covers I ve ever seen  sadly my review copy was digital  The praise coming in for it was almost all positive  therefore I went into it with much excitement  and high expectations  There was a battle to acquire the rights to the book  and after reading it it s easy to see why I really loved the idea for The Girl on the Train  Those of us that have travelled on a train will have had thoughts of the houses that we pass along the route  Mine have included wondering how people can live so close to a train line and why some houses don t have blinds  because people are bound to look in  I do anyway  it s almost like they are inviting you to look  Rachel  one of the narrators in this novel takes it a few steps further than just having a nose though  and actually invents a life for two of the people she sees daily on her commute  she even gives them names  seeing them as having the perfect life  I guess this could all sound very innocuous at first  most of us people watching in public will invent scenarios for some of the people that we see  yet this being a psychological thriller it isn t long before things take a rather sinister turn and this book becomes very  very addictive The only problem I have is trying to write this review without giving the story away  yet it s hard to discuss the book in detail without revealing stuff  All I can say this is an absolutely thrilling read  and one that you won t want to put down  I experienced many emotions reading this book  but the ones I felt the most were shock and anger  Especially towards the character of Rachel who isn t likeable in the slightest and despite the fact there are reasons why she is the way she is  I just struggled to sympathise with her  Having three narrators allows us as a reader to see the full picture  at times it felt almost wrong to know so much about the three of them whilst they were often in the dark  Not knowing which characters were trustworthy meant that I read the book almost on edge  It s essentially a classy whodunnit  with some truly messed up characters in the frame  but I found it easy to put characters into one of two piles   Maybe  and  Contrived   I really hope this doesn t spoil the book so perhaps you might want to look away but there is an especially hateful character that Paula has created here  and for me certain aspects of the story felt a little obvious and  for the most part  far too female Paula Hawkins writes expertly  debut novels rarely get much better than this and I predict Paula is going to be a star in this genre  and The Girl on the Train is going to be a memorable novel in 2015 that everybody will be talking about  and rightly so  This book is almost perfect for a film  and towards the end I was playing director in my head imagining how the shots for some tense and haunting scenes could be shot   I studied Film Studies at A Level     The book ended and I just sat there for a few minutes thinking about the story I had just read  letting my heart resume its normal rhythm  I would advise you to pick up this book as soon as you can  it s a book everybody will be talking about  and it s a lot better than the rubbish book people are comparing it to so ignore those comparisons  Those that read this book will probably never look out of a train window the same again  Rezension folgt  Oooh   a fast read because I couldn t put it down  Yes  it s a bit like  Gone Girl  in that you can t trust your main characters  It s also like a good Hitchcock mystery  and I couldn t guess who done it   but it also stands alone  I don t know if I ve read a book quite like this  The book also made me want to ride a train and have a few drinks  Or NOT have any drinks if you know this book  Enjoy      4 7 As I am stingy with stars    I totally love psychological thrillers    COULD NOT put this down today and just finished  Although the less you know about this book ahead of time the better  but I want you and ALL my friends to read it so we can talk about it      Book is an amazing first novel for author Paula Hawkins   While the writing style took a bit to get used to  the story of Character A  on different dates scattered in time  than B on similar dates  it took a while to get into  I sat on a plane and read this book in one go  The Plot twist at the end was unexpected  but not unpredictable at the end  So it wasn t too shocking A good read but I think that had I been reading it in bits at a time  I would not have enjoyed this book  Muy entretenido  Practicamente lo he devorado  estaba deseando ver si se confirmaba mi sospecha inicial y acerte   A sinopse nao e nada fidedigna a historia e as personagens relevantes  ppr isso nao se fiem  E um romance interessante e que vai captando a atencao  O final esta interessante e nao se adivinha de inicio e as varias personalidades das personagens fazem com que haja um dinamismo facil de ler  Aconselho  Le   se bem uma vez  13 gun sonra sonunda bitti  Okurken gercekten krizler gecirdim  Kitap aslinda guzel ama ben polisiye gerilim tarzi kitaplari pek sevmiyorum  genelde de hep yarim birakiyorum zaten ama Trendeki Kiz dan gercekten umitliydim  Dayanabildigim kadar dayandim ve sonunda    Kitap ilk 150 sayfada o kadar yavas ilerliyor ki yani her gun ayni olaylar oluyor hicbir sey yok o yuzden de asiri sikildim  Ama daha sonra yavas yavas olaylar gelisti kucuk ipuclari ortaya cikti ve kendimi bir anda katilin kim oldugunu tahmin etmeye calisirken buldum  Kitabi okudugum sirada herkes hic tahmin edilemeyen biri falan dedigi icin en kucuk detaya bile dikkat etmeye calistim ama gercekten hic tahmin etmedigim biri cikti  Kitabin bu gerilim sayfalarini din dersinde okudugum icin baya baya gerildim sddmkfkd Bitirebildigim ilk polisiye gerilim kitabiydi ve ben bile bitirebildiysem bu kitap gercekten guzel demektir  Eger polisiye gerilim seviyosaniz zaten alin ama eger sevmiyorsaniz bir sans vermeye deger diyorum ben  Kitaba puanim da ilk 150 sayfa yuzunden 4 5 eger o sayfalar da da ufak ufak hareketlenmeler ufak ufak ipuclari olsaydi kesinlikle 5 5ti I didn t read Gone Girl and probably won t because I know the ending  For fans of Gone Girl  The Girl on the Train can be recommended as a read alike  I figured out the twist just before it was revealed  but it kept my attention the entire time  Fast paced read    This book is a great read    It is nothing what I expected   it was better   It kept me guessing on what could have happened on the night the alcoholic character blacked out  It kept me annoyed at her for being so stupid about continuing her drinking  I was so annoyed at her poor decision making  I was also so annoyed at her ex husbands need to continue being there for her after everything that they went through  Her obsession with this strangers was so weird  it made no sense to me  At the same time I could see this in real life   it was captivating  I could not have actually guessed what happened until I was right up there    wow   It s impossible not to think of Gone Girl when reading this book  though Gone Girl remains superior  Neither book has likable characters to root for  though you are compelled to keep reading  Both have highly manipulative characters and a chilling atmosphere I like that even though this book is a thriller  a genre which usually doesn t offer anything more than an exciting ride  there is a lot under the surface  The main theme is our perception of reality vs  the reality we see on tv  Rachel  the main character  spends her days riding the train to London  passed the suburb she used to live in before her husband cheated on her and left her for the other woman  She always keeps an eye out for a beautiful couple whose life she imagines as Hollywood perfect  The reality is other  When the truth shatters the observed reality  Rachel tries to get involved to  fix  things  It is quite an exploration of how much we try to participate in the reality presented to us on tv  The drawback is the ending  which is contrived and feels manipulative By the last quarter of the book  it is easy to anticipate every event  It s a shame  because the book has a lot going for it  Desde que lei la resena del libro me parecio muy interesante  es esa clase de libro que te atrapa desde las primeras paginas  te envuelves en los personajes y te sientes identificado en como piensan o reaccionan en circunstancias que ocurren en la historia del libro  Cada personaje tiene sus tormentos guardados que van demostrandolos en el pasar de las hojas y la conexion que tiene cada uno con los otros personajes lo hace mas emocionante  Lo recomiendo de todas maneras si quieren leer un buen libro de misterio e intriga hasta el final  Entertaining  similar to Gone Girl  I found it very drawn out and wanted it to get  on with it already   Somewhat repetitious  Loved the characterization though  brilliant  3 75 5 I enjoyed it  it kept my interest right the way through  I felt certain parts of the story lacked depth and needed further explanation but it kept me hooked regardless   Rachel is a mess  pretending to go to work each day and I did not have much sympathy for her  But  as the story evolves  so did my feelings about the characters in this novel  Couldn t read it fast enough to figure out what was going on    I kind of feel bad about not liking this book more than I do  I had a lot of friends love it and recommend it  and while I did like it  I didn t LOVE it  Basically I would say it s okay plus  It was interesting and a smooth read  I thought some of the Rachel parts were a little repetitive and started to become a little tedious  but not overly so  It s definitely different then anything I ve read before which I love about it  I guess maybe I m a little disappointed that I was able to figure out  who done it  with about 100 pages left of the book  I was hoping to be wrong  I love being shocked  I realize that authors have a fine line to walk trying to give you hints without giving it away  I just caught on to something she said and figured it out before I would have liked  Don t get me wrong the rest of the book was still an interesting read and the ending satisfying  I guess I just don t necessarily get all the hype  I still give this book a solid 4 stars and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a murder mystery that s a little something different   The beginning started out a little slow but it progressed throughout the story  At first I thought Rachel was just a needy drunk who thought she could get her ex husband back but while she was staking her ex husband she witnessed something but she tends to forget or mix her memories due to her drinking that not even the police believe her  As she tries to figure out what happened the night Megan disappeared she gets herself into more trouble  In the end she figures out what really happened and more  I did ended up being a really good book      There is something comforting at the sight of strangers safe at home    I admit that I m no expert when it comes to this genre  In fact  as to date  I have only read three books including this that falls under this category  so I will have to base my review on the general impact of the novel to me to the best of my ability without any spoiler as I perfectly know that these kinds of books need to be read without spoiler  In my personal opinion  this book passes the mystery thriller suspense crime criteria with flying colors  What makes me say this has a great deal to do with the hypnotic writing style of the author  there is something eerie but magnetic with it and it is a huge mystery to me how the author is able to put across layers of meanings in the simplest thoughts and the most mundane phrases the female characters who are also the narrators utter  It is also noteworthy how the author  in order to craft this forbidding tale  deftly chose these three women who are most flawed and most foolish and yet are unexplainably capable of receiving the reader s empathy  Of the three POV s  I was most glued to that of Rachel s  the major character  whose loneliness seems to magnify her imagination which consequently becomes the core of the plot   Read the book for the story and the plot What strikes me more in the story is the absence of the dark comic tone which was very common in the other books I have read of the same sort  This exception  I think is what makes this book more realistic and well darker and more sinister  It is also quite impressively baffling that the plot seems both linear and rounded at the same time  I felt like nothing happens so much but at the same time  it also felt like everything is happening and unraveling right under my nose and I couldn t control my heart from hammering against my chest  There were times I had to stop reading and allow the creeps to surface above my skin Finally  I couldn t help but notice how stories under this genre seem to have one common theme and that is how people will crucially suffer the worst possible consequence of  view spoiler   infidelity   hide spoiler    I just hope the moral purpose of stories like this reaches the intended audience    One helpful tip in solving mysteries  Suspect the person who you least suspect or better yet  suspect everybody     Others have compared to Gone Girl and I d agree to some extent just not as twisted  This was an engrossing good read  just not great page turnerCouldn t put it down  Once I got to the halfway point I just kept going  Great writing  Love the different voices pulling the story together little by little   I read this book in one sitting  pretty much  as Zack drove us home from Missouri  It had actually been a while since I finished a book  and it felt good to read one like this that I could just rip through  I found it to be supremely entertaining and perfectly paced  In a way  it made me a little mad  because this is a book I would have loved to have written  but I don t think I could have done it this well  I watch what s going on during my train commute all the time  inside the car  out the window  while waiting on the platform  even while buying tickets  Hawkins took that commuter experience and made it something really  really special Spoilers from here When I was a kid  I hated books in which there were no likable characters  Why would I want to form a relationship with characters if I wouldn t have formed relationships with them in real life  For the most part  I stick to that idea  In this book  though  I just don t think it s necessary  Rachel is definitely sympathetic  and grows more so the more we learn about her  but I certainly wouldn t have the energy or patience to be her friend  I definitely would hate to have her as a co worker or roommate  Somehow  though  I was rooting for her  even though I was pretty sure she had  done it   As I was reading  I was saying to myself   If Hawkins can somehow turn this around so that another character was the murderer  I ll be surprised   I couldn t believe how seamlessly she dropped all her foreshadowing without my noticing  I don t know if I ve ever hated a character as much as I hate Anna  Even at the end  when she s somewhat almost okay  I just can t stand her  Obviously  I ve read books where characters have done worse things than Anna does in this book  there are even characters in this book who have done worse things than Anna  She s just so perfectly real in her evilness  She is the real kind of horrible that real people who are fairly accepted in society act  What a B My favorite was how the book started out with Rachel creating a little story about the people she passed on the train every day  I loved how expertly Hawkins used that and segued into this really cool thriller  I still don t like bouncing between character points of view  That said  when the plot turned  I turned those pages faster  I liked it far better than Gone Girl  to which it seems often compared  probably because there actually was an ending  I m not normally a reader of mysteries  but I kept running into reviews of this book both good and bad  Finally  I walked into the library  and there it was  staring me in the face  It seemed like fate Luckily  I did enjoy it  which was odd considering that I didn t like any of the main characters  The story is told from the perspective of Rachel  Rachel s ex husband s new wife  Anna  and Megan  the woman who lives nearby and who baby sat for Anna s baby  They  along with Tom  Rachel s ex husband  are all terribly self centered  unpleasant people  who basically end up getting what they deserve  The only nice character in the book comes across as something of a patsy What I did especially enjoy about the book was that none of these people can actually by totally trusted  so the reader is never sure if what they re saying is the total truth  It s their truth  just not the truth  To a certain degree  I suppose that can be said of a lot of people  Here  it adds a level of suspense  as the reader isleft to work through the clues each drops It s a fast read  and I figured out who the killer was about two thirds of the way through the book  Still  I d say it s a nice  little page turner that held my interest  Am I the last person on earth to read this book  Probably  so I m not going to bother with a detailed review  I will say that I liked it  I really really liked it  and really enjoyed reading it    until the end As soon as  the bad guy  started confessing all the details  OMG my worst pet peeve  I was ready to take a star off right then  but I was still hesitating because I enjoyed the rest so much  But then the end devolved into the same damn ending that Stephen King often resorts to   view spoiler  The angry abusive husband ex husband terrorizes the women and tries to kill them and they manage to turn the tables  The End    hide spoiler   Ho Hum  At that point  there was no way I was giving it 5 stars  So there you go  I did enjoy trying to figure out who  the bad guy  was  and I d like to say that I guessed  but I guessed them all at one point or another so I actually was surprised when it started to become obvious  I know many people hated the characters too  but I thought it was quite interesting how all the characters were pretty much scumbags  At least it wasn t JUST the men  or JUST the women  it was EVERYONE  And I loved how the story was told  and the different time periods actually worked really well So I really did enjoy it  but the end  well  it was just a lazy pants dime a dozen ending  At some point while reading this  I started to think of it as  The Cuckoo on the Choo Choo   Good story  but what a frustrating  sad  pathetic leading lady  I call her leading lady because I m sure this will become a movie  It has all the ingredients  eerie atmosphere  puzzling whodunit plot  and some seriously damaged characters  I did find it hard to read at times because Rachel  the cuckoo  is tiresome  Rachel is a drunk  and one of the best depictions of an alcoholic that I ve ever read  She is in the throes of her addiction and behaves desperately to get what she thinks she wants  to protect a man from being accused of murder  What she should want is to get sober because her life is rapidly unraveling  But her irrational behavior drives the plot to a wild ride of a climax  a kind of silly one  unfortunately  The killer is cartoonish and stands around blabbing about his her evil deeds while threatening to harm the leading lady  Who does that  except on bad cop shows  Despite the silly climax  the story carries this book and makes it a mostly entertaining and interesting read  If I would have had this book on a day off I would have read it in one sitting  Yes  I did figure it out  but only a page or two before you were  supposed  to  I like I book where I both like  and dislike  a narrator  This book gave me that  I see people comparing it to Gone Girl   I guess I can see why  as you have an unreliable story teller  but really this book can stand on it s own  It doesn t need to rely on Gone Girl s coattails  The book snob in me wavered about the fourth star  but sometimes timing is everything  I ve been feeling a little overwhelmed by my various projects and desperately needed a beach trip and a pageturner that didn t demand too much from me  I got to enjoy both of those today  and this being the book  I ll err on the side of adding that fourth star Much of this book is narrated by Rachel  whose life has basically fallen apart  An alcoholic whose husband has left her for another woman  she has been fired from her job and keeps up the pretense of traveling on the train that takes her to and from work in order to avoid the well intentioned censure and rescue efforts of her roommate  Traveling on the train  Rachel develops a fascination with a couple whose house she passes en route    a couple who happens to live very close to her old house  which is now shared by her ex and his new wife and child  Rachel s fixation on this couple and her imagined narratives about their existence take a life of their own when she learns from the news that Megan Hipwell  the woman of the couple  has abruptly and mysteriously disappeared  The investigation gives Rachel a much needed purpose in life  with surprising effects  Smaller sections of the book are narrated by Megan at earlier points in time leading up to her disappearance  and by Anna  Rachel s ex husband s new wife There s certainly what to criticize  Having Anna narrate her few sections felt a bit contrived and forced to me  I think Hawkins should have just stuck with juxtaposing Rachel s and Megan s narratives  And despite much hyped comparisons  this is not the new Gone Girl  if you re expecting that type of read you ll probably be disappointed That being said  this book kept me engaged and turning pages  I felt Rachel s pain  and grew increasingly curious both about what would happen to her and what had happened to Megan  I usually read books for characterization more than plot  and admittedly here the plotting was far more clever than the characterization  In this case  though  it was nice to have a good beach read to coincide with a trip to the beach  Incidentally  I will note that I tried this on audio earlier and couldn t follow it at all  one of those cases where I feel the book really works much better in print  The highlight of Rachel s day is this little hiccup length stall in her commute that happens within plain view of Jess and Jason s home  where sometimes she sips coffee on the porch and he stands behind her providing the sort of tender touches that make couplehood look so enticing  Okay  so their names probably aren t Jess and Jason  And all the tales of hearts and romance that she s created in her head are merely the fan fiction that accompanies the premade Gin   Tonics that she drinks from cans on the train  Okay  and there is something else  Not Jess and Not Jason just happen to live a few doors down from Rachel s old house where her ex husband and his current wife    the one he left her for    and their baby live  Rachel  the unreliable though likable character at the center of Paula Hawkins   The Girl on the Train   didn t know this handsome couple when she lived in the neighborhood  they re newbies  fascinating newbies who have just what she covets with her ex  Tom  I guess it s not too much to reveal that Rachel s commute isn t one of necessity  She lost her job weeks ago  That Gin in a Can thing isn t recreational  It s a very real  very present numbing tactic that she regularly employs    so regularly that she s alienated all sorts of people  Her only champion is a former high school classmate  a do gooder who mostly vacuums around the soiled clothing  Rachel gets a jarring visual during a certain train ride that 180s her opinion of Miss Jess  She chases it with a rip roarin  rager  She wakes from a black out drunk a bit bloody and unable to trace the events of the previous night or explain the pissed off voicemail messages from Tom  And Jess  who is actually named Megan  is missing  This book is pretty gripping  The idea of a black out drunk at the center of a crime is totally brill  Also  Hawkins finds a way to make you root for Rachel even when you want to wrap her in a coat  drive her home  lock her in her room and hide her phone  In alternating perspectives  we also get in the head of Megan and Tom s new wife  Neither are as compelling  Megan is perpetually dissatisfied  Anna isn t as strong as she could be about the meddling drunk who hangs out on the periphery of her life doing completely inappropriate things  Megan s husband Scott s motives are hard to follow and Tom is a bit wishy washy  But Rachel  Rachel is recognizable and fully realized and makes up for any other character shortcomings  I didn t want to put this one down   I didn t expect the characters to be like this  But their personal failures made them seem human and one could relate to them easily  Moreover  I was positively surprised by the ending because I expected everything but this  A real pageturner  4 5 en realidad  Tiene un final muy poco explosivo  me lo esperaba muchisimo mejor  de todos modos el desarrollo de la novela es genial  inesperado y adictivo  me ha encantado    Gave into the hype   was not disappointed  Way better than Gone Girl  though they are completely different   Given its content and style  and the recent success of Gillian Flynn  The Girl on the Train sort of begs comparison to Gone Girl  For me it felt kind of like Gone Girl light  Similar intrigue  similar twists and turns  not quite so dark or complicated  I enjoyed it very much  Entertaining  it kept me guessing  maybe not all the way until the end  but well through the story  All of the characters  even the ones we were supposed to like  had flaws  and that seemed real enough  I liked the descriptions of commuting and what that experience is like  Loved this line   There s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home    p  2   Comforting and discomforting  I could easily see this whole story developing as the product of out the window mental meandering as we decompress on our way home from yet another busy day  I would definitely read more from her P S On the cover of the book  there is a quote from Tess Gerritsen   So thrilling and tense and wildly unpredictable it sucked up my entire afternoon  Not to be missed   Wait  what  That she has the luxury of reading a 300  page novel in an afternoon reminds me yet again that I am in the wrong line of work   Every day Rachel takes the train into London  pretending she still has a job to go to  while frequently downing canned gin and tonics  As the houses flash by she fixates on the couple in one of them  imagining their golden fantasy life  Then one day she witnesses something that shatters this imagined life and by extension Rachel s own existence  She becomes involved in a police investigation where her habits of black outs make her a less than reliable witness  When a missing person turns into a murder case her ex husband and his new wife are exasperated as they find themselves drawn into Rachel s drama  Her one supportive friend is losing patience and Rachel s money is running out  Can she trust her own memories  Hawkins writes plainly without much embellishment but keeps the tension high so you ll find yourself wanting to stay up late to read just one more chapter  There s no mid book Gone Girl big reveal  instead you need to read to the bitter end to find out if Rachel s obsession is real or the product of a sozzled brain   Sat pikkfost yfir thessari serkennilegu sogu  sem eg las i sumarfriinu minu  Eg hef ekki getad haett ad hugsa um adalpersonuna og orlog hennar  Eini gallinn vid thessa bok er liklega sa ad madur faer netta obeit a afengi    Dear Thriller Book Marketers  Stop comparing new releases to Gone Girl  That just sets my expectations much too high  and I m invariably disappointed  K This book is good  no question  Read it in a day  rushed to get to the answers  enjoyed the unreliable narrator s  immensely  I say you should get it  Read it  Just don t expect Gillian Flynn   Its taken me quite some time to finish this book  but I m so glad I did  Its pretty interesting  since I had no idea who it could have been  This entire time  I kept questioning  who could it be  who could it be  I trusted almost no one  But when I found out who it was I was like duh  Of course  makes sense  That is what I like about a good mystery  that I have no idea who it is  but once I find out I m like yes  finally  Its a shame I don t read much mystery  as I love my fantasy and sci fi  But now  I think I ll go on a little bit of a mystery binge I really enjoyed Paula Hawkins writing style  especially that we see the perspective of Megan  Rachel and even Anna  Honestly  I disliked almost everyone when I first met them  even Cathy  Rachel s flat mate  But the character development  wow  it was amazing  Some I started to HATE others I felt such mixed emotions  But I enjoyed the fact that the characters were believable  that there are really people out there like this  Sometimes you read a book and you re like I don t feel any emotion for this person  not at all realistic  I can t deal  But this book was great  I felt quiet a lot of emotion  there was even a part were I cried cause I just could not deal  even had to put it down  But anyways  I definitely recommend this book  I don t want to keep telling you about the book because it will give away things  and I surely do NOT want to spoil anyone  If you like mysteries  definitely check it out   I was going to avoid this book as I didn t like the sound of it and thought it sounded boring  but it wasn t at all it kept me glued to the pages and I found myself not able to put it down I changed my mind about who I liked or disliked and who I thought did what to whom several times which I enjoyed as most books it can become quite clear who the  bad  guy girl is early on in the story Would definitely recommend it to others  So after months of searching for this book  I finally found this in a local bookstore and read it soon after  I ve heard so many great reviews of this book  And I gave it 4 stars mainly because it had a really solid plot with unique POV from 3 different women at almost similar time frames  Hawkins showed us a bit of the future then flash backed to how the future came to be  I really liked the suspense created  but unfortunately I found the plot a bit too slow  I was expecting immediate drama suspense but it came a bit late    in the middle of the book I believe  And I figured out the plot twist before Hawkins revealed the person  D Now that was fun to do  I rarely read thrillers  so that was a new experience for me  Other than that  it s a really captivating read  I understand why it s so popular  I felt such a strong emotional relation with the main character  sometimes I feel like helping her  sometimes I want to slap her  Any author who makes me feel this way about their characters is a good one A recommended read from me  Hope you enjoy it     Wow  This book was amazing  At first  I was just interested  Then over time  I found myself annoyed at the chief protagonist   I have no patience for women who are victims of their own behavior  Then  boom  The book picked up steam  at 3 a m  when I woke up sleepless  and I could not put it down until I finished it at 4 30 a m  Really good  This is the new  Gone Girl  and I highly recommend it  New to me author and a new psychological thriller makes for a great weekend of reading Same train   every morning   everything the same   until one morning when Rachel sees something shocking and then nothing is the same again This tale is told from the POV of three different voices   one is an alcoholic  another a liar  and the other a cheater  making this story even more intriguing  Behind closed doors no one can ever be sure what is taking place An impressively written dark and gritty thriller  Keeps readers dizzy while trying to piece the puzzle together  Liars and cheaters and alcoholics  OH MY   Twisting the corkscrew in  farther and farther  ripping into his throat     This single line warranted an additional star for me with this book  I m not quite a fan of this genre of literature but this was definitely a page turner for me  If only to get to the actual  meat  of the story in order to understand what the hell it was that I had been reading  There was no character that I connected with as they were all completely batshit crazy and I believe that is quite an understatement  About half way through I made the statement that I wish this book was about a girl on a train that experiences a train crash and the entire book is taking place in her head while she is in a coma   then she dies  My naive mind wishes that the world didn t have these type of people in it however  I m not dumb enough to think that people like Hannibal don t really exist  All in all  i m sure for some people it was a home run  It was decent and I finished it in 24 hours which means that it was gripping enough for me to lose sleep over  Take that as you may  At least I ve knocked out one of those less desirable books on my reading challenge   An absolute page turner  It doesn t have a single moment of boredom  The fact that the drama unfolds as first person accounts of multiple central characters makes it quite intriguing  it kept me engaged without compelling me to get over involved with any one specific character  Also  while at the heart of this story is a murder investigation  the book carries no sense of urgency or desperation to incriminate anyone  Things seem to fall into place as a result of the circumstances and actions of the people involved  This was quite a welcome change from a lot of regular thrillers that generally lay great emphasis on details of police interrogation  the search for evidence etc  The end sort of lacks spunk  as compared to the rest of the story that has you hooked right from the beginning  But ultimately  all you feel for Hawkins is appreciation  for providing 336 pages of sheer enthralling entertainment  As a reviewer said in US Today   Here come the  Gone Girl  knock offs   In all fairness  who knows  Maybe this book was written before  Gone Girl  and has been floating around publishers for years  But if you loved  Gone Girl   you will probably love this book I didn t love it  but boy  did it hold my attention  If I hadn t been so busy  I would have read it all in one go  I had to force myself to put it down and go to bed  And then  it would keep me up at night  I won t say much because I run the risk of giving something away  There are twists at every turn  I had no idea what was going to happen right up until the very end  The very end  And then  I still wasn t sure  I had to flip back to make sure I was understanding it correctly  The plot is suspenseful  The author is constantly throwing in little bits like   I don t know whether they see me  though  for what I really am   Huh   What  are you  Rachel  Or   On the way back down the road  he passes me in his car  our eyes meet for just a second and he smiles at me   Who  Who s smiling at you  Megan  Or   What bothers me most is that I haven t got to the end of my story     What story  What happened  The stories of the three narrators  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  criss and cross  and go back and forth in time  They intersect  then  come together in the end   and your questions are finally answered  You probably will not have guessed those answers before then  Or you might think you have  then  there s a twist that proves you wrong  I thought the book was great at keeping you in constant suspense   and constant stress The way in which it was most like  Gone Girl   was the extremely unlikeable characters  EXTREMELY unlikeable  Every single one of them  I have a problem with books where I can t like a single character  I guess I prefer books where I can feel some optimism  where I can feel like there are good people in this world  Not here  Look for  The Girl on the Train  at a theatre near you  I m sure it will be soon   Ride This Train at Your Own PerilThis intense read is a book club selection  The unlikable characters and psychological mystery reminded me of Gone Girl  but differences included the British setting and heavy presence of alcohol muddying the waters  Both books are well written but leave me cringing from their ick factor Rachel is a thirty something alcoholic who takes the same train to the city every day  One flat visible from the tracks houses a beautiful man and woman  and Rachel makes up stories about them and their apparently blissful marriage  Her own marriage to a man named Tom fell apart due to her infertility  resulting alcohol binges  and his affair with a woman who is now his wife Then one day  from the train  Rachel sees the beautiful woman kissing another man  and she inserts herself into their story  The woman goes missing  possibly the victim of murder  Is Rachel to blame It s masterful how the author manipulates my feelings for Rachel throughout the novel  She has to watch Tom move on with Anna  who gives him a child  and that poignant scenario engenders sympathy for Rachel  But her continual return to alcohol to deal with her problems grows frustrating  There s also a cold distance to her that makes it tough to feel close to her  Perhaps that s the alcohol fog  This explanation of alcohol blackouts intrigues me Blacking out wasn t simply a matter of forgetting what had happened  but having no memories to forget in the first place  The theory was that you get into a state where your brain no longer makes short term memories  And while you re there  in deepest black  you don t behave as you usually would  because you re simply reacting to the very last thing that you THINK happened  because    since you aren t making memories    you might not know what the last thing that happened really was I also found it fascinating when Tom s new wife Anna starts to compare herself to Rachel  a woman she abhors And now I find myself behaving exactly like Rachel used to  polishing off the half bottle of red left over from dinner last night and snooping around on his computer  It s easier to understand her behavior when you feel like I feel right now  There s nothing so painful  so corrosive  as suspicion I didn t predict the twist  and the book ended in a satisfying way  I m certainly not an expert in the mystery thriller genre  but found this to be a fun read      Took a break from reading young adult and middle grade books to read an adult novel  This book was given to me by a fellow teacher on the last day of the Boothbay Literacy Retreat  and yes  I  too  have already passed it on  It was a great book of suspense and mystery  although  I did have the  whodunnit  figured out about half way through  But  that didn t bother me  I wanted to see how it all played out  and the movement of narrators chapter by chapter keeps the story interesting and moving forward The narrators are  Rachel  the Girl on the Train  who we quickly discover has an alcohol problem  Traveling on the same train day after day  she makes up stories about a couple she sees  whom she calls Jess and Jason who seem madly in love  They live just a few doors down from where she once lived with her husband until their divorce  Meghan  the girl who turns up missing  This is the same girl that Rachel calls Jess  and on the very day that she goes missing  Rachel has seen her with another man  Certain that this information would be vital to the investigation  Rachel feels she must let the police know  but is surprised when the police consider her an unreliable witness  Anna  the jealous and egocentric woman married to Rachel s ex husband  who is suspicious of Rachel spending time on her street  especially because of a past history of difficulties  Believe me  none of these narrators are totally likable  they have personality quirks that make you want to shake them and yell at them and tell them to get their lives together  But somehow  you do end up caring about them  and wanting to see them make it in the end  Definitely a good beach read   I read it in about a day and a half  This story started out very slow  I was kind of bored with it a third of the way through  I greatly disliked almost every character  I had a hard time following 3 women s stories not knowing the connection and keeping up with dates throughout that are not always in order  I think the author tried too hard to confuse the reader on who the killer was and ended up just confusing the reader  I still liked the overall story line  It was entertaining  I listened to this and the narration was good  I really liked The Girl On The Train  As a big fan of Gillian Flynn I knew that almost NOTHING could compare to her magnificient books so I read TGOTT as it was  a debut novel  and I really enjoyed it  We need to remember that Gone Girl is the third book of Flynn  and her first  Sharp Objects wasnt THAT good compared to Gone Girl  I just cant wait to Paula Hawkins grow as an author and to see her progress through the years  D This book was entertaining  the characters were   interesting to say the least  I loved it  Kept me interested the entire time  Read it in 2 days  I only wished they had added some more detail in the end  It felt a little rushed to me  A whole month of time missing after the twist at the end  And the end was really unexpected to me  This book was like meeting a cross dressing serial killer who believes the world is controlled by giant turtles orbiting us in satellites and having them only want to talk about the weather  in other words it started off so messed up and crazy  the good interesting kind  but ended up kind of pedestrian  That doesn t make it bad  It was a good mystery  quite readable  and well told  but it was just a bit of wasted potential in a way  The characters seemed bonkers but were really just victims of circumstance  well except for the killer  that character was crazy  but not David Fincher crazy  more like Lifetime movie network crazy  Still great and still worth a read  I very much liked it      minor spoilersRating  Four out of Five StarsThe Girl on the Train  a thriller novel by Paula Hawkins  was an extremely interesting book that I enjoyed reading  The book contained all the makings of a perfect story  love  hate  obsession  crime  and self realization  The book kept me on my toes the whole time by making sudden  unexpected twists in the story  Paula Hawkins was really able to engage me as a reader by introducing a simple question with a very complex answer  What happened to Rachel Watson  The Girl on the Train follows the story of Rachel Watson  at 32 years old she has already gone through a painful divorce caused by her dependency on alcohol  Every day  Rachel rides a train to and from London  One day  she notices a beautiful couple out on the deck  Although she doesn t even know them  in her head Rachel renames them Jason and Jess and imagines how perfect their lives are together  However  while she is reading the paper  Rachel sees that  Jess  has gone missing and her real name is Megan Hipwell  Convinced that she must have done something in an alcohol fueled rage  Rachel decides to further investigate the disappearance of Megan  Unbeknownst to her  this investigation would lead her to the most painful reminder of the life that she used to have  her ex husband Tom Unlike so many other crime books that I have read  The Girl on the Train was able to keep things interesting without confusing me  If I had one complaint about the book  it would be that it was a little too mature for me but that is not the author s fault at all  Personally  I would recommend the book to someone in their thirties or above  I found that I couldn t relate to any of the characters  situations because they were very  adult  problems  Paula Hawkins was able to create a fascinating  intriguing novel that was hard for me to put down  In fact  the book was so interesting that I forgot that I was reading it for school and it began to take up my free time because I couldn t wait to see what would happen next   One of things I found to be the most interesting in the book was the way that Rachel viewed her people watching   Twice a day  I am offered a view into other lives  just for a moment  There s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home    Hawkins 4   I  like many others  love to know what s going on in people s lives but I almost always forget what they said and move on  However  Rachel views her people watching as a view into their lives  Hawkins introduces this thought fairly early on in the novel which allowed me to see that Rachel is so unhappy in her own life  that the best way for her to feel better is by imaging how perfect other peoples  lives are  In conclusion  I think that The Girl on the Train was an excellent book  I would love to read it again in 15 years or so  so that I can see if my thoughts on it change as I gain maturity  I really enjoyed reading this book for my SRP project and I look forward to next quarter s project  I really enjoyed reading this  I m not one for thrillers so it was a good change from my reading habits  The ending could have been better though  And I felt the female characters were too similar  It s a great read for a lazy weekend  Great read  It reminds me of Gone Girl in the sense of the suspense element that works in this piece  Recommended This book is nice and easy to read  the language helps you relax and relate to the characters involved  I found it a bit slow going to begin with but then the twist came and I couldn t put it down Really  it s a 3 5 but I had to round up for goodreads  It s not a showstopper  but it s a good  effortless summer read   Messed up  but good  I read this first on the kindle then was lucky enough to get it in hard back  The biggest negative to this book is that in places it is quite confusing and there was a few times I had to re read a page or so again to understand it  I went through periods of liking and hating Rachel in equal amounts  Her character came over as very weak and vulnerable obviously because of her addiction but it drove me nutty  I wanted her even in the early chapters to pick herself up and stop acting a victim  Did the author want to portray weak women  As in fact I found all three main women characters weak and submissive  Two only coming stronger in the final pages   On the whole though a really good read  For obvious reasons it was easy to guess  whodunnit  quite early on in the book but that didn t deter my enjoyment of it  A good read on s nice long train journey   4 5 starsThe train has arrived       with suspense  mystery  secrets and startling truths intertwined in this novel  The main character Rachael is a protagonist  not all that likable and resorts to the bottle to get through daily life which is teetering on the edge  She is divorced by her husband and has lost her job  Keeping the job loss a secret from her roommate  she continues to ride the train into the city every day  pretending to go to work  On the train ride  Rachael observes a couple on their home patio along the train route to town  She begins to create a  perfect couple  story about them  comparing them to her life prior to her divorce when she lived only a few doors down from them  Her ex husband is remarried to Anna and with a toddler they now live in the house Rachael once shared with her ex Enter  perfect couple  Megan who goes missing on a day Rachael has drank herself into a black out  The story is told from three different viewpoints  Rachael  Anna and Megan each giving a slightly different take on the story  There are a number of characters and all are complex and flawed  They lie  cheat and deceive and so nothing is really as it first appears and  more importantly  nobody is as they first seem  The plot was excellent  the pace and intrigue made this a page turner   This book got off to a horribly slow start  and I nearly gave up for that reason  I had heard nothing but good things  though  and I decided to power through it anyway  I m incredibly glad I did  because it got so much better  I figured out who the killer was before it was revealed  but that didn t stop me from enjoying it  If you re a fan of the Millennium series or Gone Girl  you will probably enjoy this  For sure entertaining  I did read it in 24 hours  I found the plot to be pretty depressing and a little annoying  The women characters were disappointing  Really I didn t like any of the characters  I became mostly annoyed by their idiocy  While a quick read it didn t spark any emotional attachment to anything  I m giving it 4 stars purely for the entertainment factor  not really for a good book rating  Overrated really  4 5 stars  What a roller coaster ride  I was guessing up until nearly the end  Not my typical book  but it did keep me intrigued  I don t tend to like books that have unlikable narrators  While I didn t like Rachel at first  she did grow on me a bit as she struggled to remember what happened Solid book for those who like mysteries  This book is being compared a lot to Gone Girl  And I guess there is a missing woman in this book too  but it s not really a comparison I d jump to make  It s just not as dark and sinister as Gone Girl  It doesn t give off the same vibe  That being said  similar to Gone Girl  the characters aren t particularly likable  But I was still invested in their lives  even if I thought they made stupid decisions and didn t always agree with them  The writing style of this book is very straightforward and almost clinical  But it works  The story is told from three perspectives in two different timelines  Each gave something different to the story which I liked  Even though in my opinion the voices didn t feel very different  The only complaint that I really had was that the police didn t feel very present for a book about a crime  It s a minor complaint because I know it wasn t told from that perspective and that this wasn t a police procedural  but I couldn t help but wish we saw a little more of that aspect through the characters eyes because it felt like they weren t really doing anything at all  Overall this was a fast read that I enjoyed  Any comparisons to GONE GIRL  for me  are left behind with the missing girl plot  In many ways this is a better book Though the book is mainly told through Rachel s eyes  two other women s stories add to this thriller that is reminiscent of Hitchcock  Rachel s main storyline guides us through her boozy  blurry  voyeuristic observations from the train window  a couple who share a house a few doors away from a house she recently shared with her ex husband  There were a lot of coincidences that reminded me this was fiction  and the proximity of the houses was one of them  Still  I couldn t put the story down  and I rooted for Rachel to stop doing stupid things and pull herself together  When the woman who lives in the house near Rachel s ex s home goes missing  of course Rachel is all over that  Why  Well  she s created a fiction for the couple  Jess and Jason  not really  but in her mind   She s also seen  Jess  kissing someone who wasn t  Jason   She s also realistically needy in the way addicts are  lonely  obsessive  compulsive when drunk I m reminded of Rear Window  Characters don t know how public their lives are  and the  gaze  of onlookers seems both a little righteous and a little prurient  Isn t it your right to look out the train windows and observe  Isn t it also something to be ashamed of  Among the strong parts of the book are the different  windows  into the three women s lives  Herein lies one of my complaints  though  the voices sometimes blended together and the women tended to stay within their types  frustrated mom  vixen  barren lady   I didn t buy that Rachel became an alcoholic because she couldn t get pregnant  and I didn t buy that line about women only being valued for beauty and motherhood  Besides  if motherhood is such an overwhelming desire  why not adopt  The theme of being hot and pretty  and blonde   came up a bunch  and I felt myself craving more behind all of the surface stuff All that said  the logic of the both the mystery and Rachel s psychology work together well  I saw the ending coming  but that didn t bother me  A very worthwhile read   Rachel s life is off the rails  Unable to conceive  her husband leaves her for another woman and immediately has a baby  The twice daily journey to and from London forces Rachel to ride by the house she once loved  envisioning the blissful family she lost  She creates a fantasy life for a neighboring couple she sees during her train ride  developing them into the perfect couple  When the woman inexplicably disappears  Rachel injects herself into the investigation  but her alcoholism does more than discredit her  She loses her job  her roommate threatens to kick her out  and the black outs start  Struggling to differentiate between reality and fantasy  Rachel must uncover the truth over what happened in order to reclaim her life Told through the eyes of Rachel  her husband s new wife  and the woman who disappeared  this novel explores an array of issues  including adultery  alcoholism  and loss  The informal style indirectly delineates the characters  making them flawed and real  Rachel s inability to stop drinking amidst her confusion and desperate need to recall events is poignant  The women s differences uniquely show their similarities and form reader empathy This is a character based novel  with the mystery of the crime placed in the background  It is a successful stylistic device  However  the interjection of past timeline in a mostly chronological sequence is confusing  A linear approach would benefit pacing without sacrificing suspense  Couldn t put this book down  Read it in just one day  4 5 from me  I d say 5  but I won t read it again since the mystery is solved for me  But I loved the characters  the drama  the suspense  the twists  Totally recommend this one   Rachel s life is one humongous mess  Her husband Tom  who Rachel still loves and is obsessed with  left her for Anna and they have an infant daughter  Rachel is a drunk and at night she repeatedly calls Tom during her black outs  Sometimes she even walks past her old house  where Tom and Anna live  and rings the doorbell  She has lost her job but she still rides the train daily to London as if she were still working  She lives with a college friend who is getting sick of her drinking  As Rachel rides the train  she looks into one particular apartment that is near the tracks  Inside  she views a couple who she fantasizes about  even giving them fictional names  She imagines this couple as happy and devoted to one another  One day  however  she sees the woman kissing someone other than her partner and Rachel s cannot get her head around this The novel is an astute psychological study of one woman s addiction and attempt to hold on to reality  It examines how she instills herself into the lives of others in order to find some meaning in her own life  As she becomes more and more enmeshed in others  lives  her own objectives come into question  There is a lot of action and intrigue in this book  As a clinical social worker  I deal a lot with addictions and this book has one of the best descriptions of alcoholism that I ve ever encountered  The personality of Rachel is caught dead on and I felt like I knew her inside and out  The novel is told from different perspectives  primarily those of Rachel and Anna  It is a real page turner and difficult to put down  I didn t see the end coming but it all fell into place  Enjoy a fun read and watch out for the movie   I hear it will be out later this year  I don t read many thrillers but this one pulls you in and won t let go  Dark  twisted  paranoid and full of secrets and lies  If you think you know people   think again  I really enjoyed this one  I agree with Andi that I hated all of the narrators  but the book kept me guessing for a long time and the end was super suspenseful  Reading the description of this book  I was automatically intrigued  The story centers around the lives of three very different women whose lives become intertwined through their varying degrees of separation  The primary protagonist is Rachel Watson  a recent divorcee  whose life is seemingly in shambles  Rachel commutes everyday on the train and in her travels she daydreams about the life of a couple she passes on her daily journey  But as we all know  life is no fairy tale  And thus begins a winding  twisting journey into the lives of the people around us and how nothing is ever really as it seems  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  It has had many comparisons to Gillian Flynn s  Gone Girl   which a semi accurate  It is a thriller about a couple and the goings on in their relationship  but that is as close as the two come   Gone Girl  was much darker and I found it to be a better read  But that is just my opinion   The Girl on the Train  is a very good book  It is like an episode of CSI or one of it s similar counterparts  I found the story interesting  The writing was very skillful  I greatly enjoyed the setting of London  The characters were real and flawed as we all are  Every time I picked up this book I was in this world  which is a credit to the author s writing ability  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I did predict the fairly near the beginning  but that is not to say the book is predictably  Many scenes and outcomes did have a bit of a shock value  I also rated it a 4 because it did lull in a few places that seemed to drag out the outcome  I would read another book by this author without hesitation just to see what she comes up with next  I would recommend this book to fans of psychological thrillers   What can I say  I seem to enjoy books that gave characters with no redeeming qualities  Such a cast of interesting people bouncing in and out of this story  You can t really root for anyone  but they make you want more nonetheless  Loved everything about this story  If you are looking for a good thriller  pick it up now  Very well written  Loved the twists and turns  Super fast read   Oh  the twists  Oh  THE TURNS   This was a well written  suspense filled story  It had the sad undertones but definitely kept me up reading late and thinking about the book when I wasn t reading it  Great ending  I had a tough time getting started with this book but eventually it had me hooked  Unlike many reviews  I do not think this is at all like Gone Girl  Sure  there are similarities  but I m not sure any book can ever take the place of that one  A good read nonetheless  Good  but a slow start  Let s stop the comparisons right now  This isn t  Gone Girl   And I m ok with that  Indeed  comparing this novel to Gone Girl can seem a little unfair to Paula Hawkins  as she s created an intricate thriller here that deserves to stand on its own two feet  Rachel catches the same train every day  She takes in the scenery and observes a couple whose house backs onto the train tracks  They are the epitome of the perfect power couple  strong  lithe  happy and carefree  She anticipates seeing them every day  and creates a narrative to suit their perfect frames  Jess  a successful freelance artist  and Jason  a strong  capable man who looks after his wife and cares for her deeply  Rachel uses the couple as a method of escape   she s struggling with the truth that her husband left her for another woman  and they are now living her dream life in the house two doors down from Jess and Jason  Its enough to push her close to breaking point  Rachel is struggling with sobriety  living with a friend  and creating a facade that she is still employed and on the mend  The truth is very far indeed from this ideal situation  Rachel harasses and scares her ex husbands new wife and child  and she hasn t worked in months  She travels to the city to drink away her worries  and returns home to drink some more  She s not a particularly enticing character  When there is an awareness of the depth of her problems  its embarrassing to read along and see what she s doing  You want to shake her a little bit  sober her up and put her on the mend  but reading Rachel s account is akin to watching an accident in slow motion   there s nothing you can do to stop the inevitable from happening  After a bender  Rachel wakes up injured  and scared  She can t recall what happened  and after reading that Megan  her  Jess   has gone missing  Rachel has be terrible feeling that she knows more than she thinks about this crime  Indeed  Rachel has seen Megan with another man  and her perfect life is not as rosy as it should have been  Rachel no longer held Megan in awe  but didn t expect something like this to happen  We hear from Megan in short bursts throughout the novel   and again  she s hard to like  She gets what she wants  and if she doesn t then there s hell to pay  Megan s had a tough life  and she s used to surviving on her terms  Being married to Scott  Rachel called him  Jason   has given her security  but at what cost  She feels that she s lost her wild freedom  and is stifled by the life of a housewife  It was only a matter of time before she started looking for something to excite her  Anna  Tom s new wife  knows she s the perfect match for him  She s heard the stories of the crazy alcoholic ex wife  and feels no pity for her  Anna just wishes that she would get the hell out of her life and stop showing up  terrifying her and her daughter Evie  Tom has moved on and Anna feels that they are a strong couple  He would never treat her the same way he treated Rachel  He only cheated because she drove him to it  right  Rachel continues to feel an affinity towards Scott and his missing wife  She speaks to the police  not doing herself any favors in the process  and attempts to get close to Scott to provide the critical news that no one seems to know   Megan was having an affair with her therapist  As the weeks stretch on and Megan isn t found  suspicion is cast on Scott as the husband  and the lover in the usual way  But the puzzle pieces aren t fitting  Will Rachel remember what she knew before it s too late  The suspicion and intrigue can take a while to build in this novel  It s a slow burn  with plenty of twists and turns  If you check your  Gone Girl  expectations at the door  you ll enjoy  The Girl on the Train  for its strong merits    I enjoy books by British authors and or set in London Scotland Wales Ireland  The Girl on the Train however  was even more enjoyable because of the intrigue and mystery that followed the main characters  Having had a close friendship from childhood with a person who developed alcoholism  allowed me to empathize with Rachel s struggles and know that black outs and being unable to remember events is real  It also caused me to sympathize with Rachel and how her drinking impacted her relationships with others  As I have found myself  people watching  in airports or other busy  noisy public places  I could also identify with Rachel s overactive mind as she watched people and changes in the scenery out the window of the train  Admittedly  I did find the beginning of the book somewhat confusing as the author jumped back and forth in time and between characters  This would be a difficult book to listen to  via audio   si duda alguna te engancha   una narrativa que te atrapa   con personajes desde un principio bien definidos   la escritora tiene la facilidad de meterte entre sus paginas dando asi como resultado que todo lo que pasa en este   es tu mundo y no quieres soltarlo   me gusto este libro un thriller bien hecho en cuanto al final queria que fuera mas explosivo   sin embargo estuvo bien   es de esos libros que tiene punto medio que deliveras en cuanto a una puntuacion exacta   ya que es tanto el auge de este que esperas algo espectacular   Un lectura ligera   que engana   te mantiene en suspenson pagina tras pagina   Un lectura recomendada para pasar un buen rato   Puntuacion   3 75   4   5  Dang  Everyone in this book has an issue  Loved it  I listened to the audio on my drive up to NY   Holy sh t   Although there were absolutely no redeeming qualities to any of the characters  this was a bit of a page turner  I figured it out shortly before Rachel did  but I still couldn t put it down  Not having any characters to really pull for  including the deceased  made it a bit disappointing  although there was a glimmer of hope at the end If you liked Gone  Girl  you will like this one     mild barely spoiler alert   This was great suspense novel  but not quite the next Gone Girl like some are saying  I know some are saying they couldn t like Rachel  but I did  I felt really bad for her but I thought the author did a good job portraying the spiral of an alcoholic  There were quite a few twists and turns and that kept it a page turner for basically the entire book  which is always a good thing  I really liked the ending too  It would have been nice for Tom to elaborate more on his lies from when he was with Rachel  but I guess there was enough to get the point  Overall  a great book I d definitely recommend  I had not been this excited to read a book in so long  and I am lucky enough to have a kind mother who bought it for me with the promise that she could read it after me  The premise intrigued me greatly  I myself am guilty of people watching on trains  for the whole of last summer I commuted to and from Manchester every day and began to notice familiar faces  But this is people watching to the extreme  Rachel is a truly disturbing character  I wish we didn t share a name   and I didn t find her that likeable  However  I found her life  along with Anna and Megan s  addictive  At points I found myself almost cringing at some of her decisions  how she repeatedly returned to Witney even though it spelled trouble every time  Just as she couldn t resist observing her invented character s lives through the train window  I couldn t help but read about her alcohol fuelled struggles  After recently finishing a book about a dementia sufferer s battle with memory  I couldn t help but feel irritated by Rachel s repeated  and completely avoidable  disregard for both her health and sanity  I think her flatmate Cathy is the saint of the novel  I don t know for how long I could tolerate such behaviour in someone I was living with That said  I enjoyed Hawkins  ability to release key details slowly  allowing me to piece together bits of evidence alongside Rachel as she slowly gathered memories of  that night   Unfortunately  I guessed the culprit pretty early on  and I think that was caused by Hawkins  use of an small character list  The intertwining lives of the limited characters became both effective and detrimental to the mystery  I did quite like the fact that I couldn t trust any of the three female narrators though  they were all slightly on the verge of breakdown which made me do more of the work  I like a book that challenges me and forces me to guess what will happen next I had to give this book 4 stars because I just felt it lacked something in the ending  but I am not disputing that this is a truly enthralling read  and one that fully deserves the buzz surrounding it  I wasn t sure about this book at first  Several co workers read it  stated they hated the characters but it had a crazy ending that made it worth it  sound familiar  Gone Girl fans   I wasn t sure after the first two chapters  is this girl really just on a train the whole book  How boring  The answer is no  she s not on the train and  no  it s not boring  I flew through this book once I got into it  The characters didn t bother me either  Rachel is in a dark place  drinking constantly  feeling rejected and depressed  I definitely felt sympathy for her  at least until she went completely off the rails  Megan is struggling to find herself  feeling lost  and struggling with her own demons  Been there  It s definitely worth a read to see how their lives intertwine and what happens when they do   I picked this up at an airport and it made my two hour flight delay fly  no pun intended  by  Rachel is having a hard time recovering from a sudden divorce  She has slipped into alcoholism and tortures herself by taking the train by her former house every day  where her husband lives with his new wife and their young child  During these twice daily trips she observes a beautiful young couple and wonders about their lives  When the woman in this couple disappears  Rachel remembers seeing something that could be important  Given the unreliable narrators and issues of contemporary marriage and the way people present their relationships publicly  comparisons to Gone Girl are somewhat inevitable  Unlike Gone Girl  in which horrible people do horrible things to each other  The Girl on The Train has a few more subtleties about behaviour  expectations  and relationships  The characters are perhaps bit more relatable  although they still make plenty enough bad decisions to make for an engrossing thriller    4 5 stars I can see why some readers have compared The Girl On The Train with Gone Girl   they are both intense  gripping psychological thrillers that are hard to put down  Best of all  the characters are flawed  ranging from downright pathetic to sociopathic   WARNING  If you re the type of reader who needs to find someone to cheer for  then you re going to be extremely disappointed  On the other hand  if you re anything like me  you re going to be sporting an evil little grin throughout the entire story  Psychological thriller that reminded me a bit of Rear Window  The author had me turning pages to find out what would happen next Some foul language  I actually enjoyed this book  Kept me guessing for a bit  Couldn t put it down  even though it isn t a particularly fantastic book to be discussed for decades on end  there is something about it that really begins to grow on you  The characters are not ones I liked or could even relate to that much  but somehow that was intriguing to me  They drew me in slowly  especially Rachel s character who was by far the most compelling   repulsive at the same time  The chacracters also evolved  or more accurately  the descriptions of their actions  their personalities and their lives in general were akin to peeling away layers of an onion  Excellent storytelling on Hawkins part  I especially enjoyed Rachel s willing perception of truth  the fact that  even though her life was in shambles and even chaos for the most part  she looked at each event occurring in her life with rationality  with a lot of thought and open mindedness  The hype of a book can certainly skew one s opinions pre conceived notions  I don t have TV  I am not a part of any circle of friends who discuss books regularly and being a single mom of 3 kids  barely have time to  research  books let along read them  Just picked it off the shelf  began to read  and enjoyed immensely  I ve noticed I have also really been into English women writer s fiction mystery thriller detective books as well  at least at the moment  Can t wait for the next one  If anyone has a suggestion  please pipe in and let me know      Overall  I enjoyed reading this book  I agree with those who say they felt the book bogged down a bit in the middle  The ending was not a complete shocker  but still I found it satisfying  I found the characters to be believable in a tragic sort of way  It left me feeling sad for all the brokenness in our world   It took me all of about five hours to finish this book  A good  quick read  Not sure if intended by author  but the book is loaded with run on sentences  The book reads like a journal  so maybe the choppiness of it all goes with that theme  Good story with delayed buildup  but the ending kind of disappointed  Maybe it s just me  I was disappointed the book ended  Anyways  the theme these days goes along with titling chapters by the names of characters in the story  then writing from that character s perspective  Interesting  Is the  narrator  disappearing  being dissolved into the characters themselves   Un buon libro  non il capolavoro che un buon marketing ha dipinto  ma un thriller con una struttura interessante  Praticamente a meta pero si capisce chi e l assassino e questo toglie pathos  ma resta la curiosita di vedere come si sviluppera il personaggio di Rachel  Unica nota che mi fa storcere un po  il naso e  che tutti i protagonisti parlano allo stesso modo  Se all inizio del capitolo non ci fosse scritto di chi si tratta si potrebbero tranquillamente confondere megan  Anna ed alle volte perfino scott  Ma una lettura piacevole  I had such high hopes for this book based on the reviews and buzz it got online  Well  I did enjoy it  but I don t think it was all that and a bag of chips  The stories   because there were multiple intertwined stories here  not a single narrative   were well written  although it took me a bit of time to realize that all the narrators were unreliable  And I found myself cringing each time Rachel took another drink  or Anna worried about Rachel bothering her and her family  or Megan got all cuckoo  So  we have three unreliable narrators   who were also unlikable  I d give this a solid 3 5 stars  because it was well written  and I did like the ending   I was hesitant in giving a review of this book because I don t know how to rate this book in the first place  it has the mystery vibe  but it reminded of Gone Girl  it s not a bad thing  but this one reminded me TOO much of Gone Girl which it wasn t that surprising anymore and kind of annoying for me since I just read Gone Girl before this book LOL The main characters in this book are exactly and almost identical to the ones in Gone Girl   same motive  same pattern  It stil has a nice plot  I love the psychology side behind it  In opposite to most reviews  the character s complexity and bad sides are what I love the book actually  No one is perfect  Everybody has its flaws and its humanity at its rawest  Love the ending even if I knew who the   villain     like a lot of people did  was since the beginning but I still love the execution    P S   Full review to come soon on my blog    Trang  Book Bloggerhttp   bookidote wordpress com While I did not particularly like any of these characters  I really wanted to know what happened  The suspense kept me listening   The three narrators in the book are not fully reliable  so you re never quite sure how to take their interpretation of events  This makes for a fun  quick read  because I was always curious to read on to see how their perspectives would intertwine to reveal the full picture   Wow  this book is an absorbing thriller that I gobbled in just a few bites  I know people are comparing it to Gone Girl  but I can t say it particularly reminded me of it  I think this novel stands on its own  I loved the way the story unfolded and how the author presented it from such varying points of view  I loved how my understanding of the characters changed as the story went on and how I rooted for Rachel even as she repeatedly disappointed me  It s been a long time since I found a book that held my attention the way this one did  Very well done   RachelSo  I m going into this book knowing nothing other than all of social media recommends it  and everyone seems to be reading it  I wonder if this is a product of the machine  or a genuinely good read  Based on this first section  I am undecided leaning toward liking it  Rachel people watches in a similar way that I do  I don t name people  but I always fill in their lives like this  Seems one of the big themes of the story will be alcoholism     at least as far as Rachel goes  There are three ladies who tell this story  The next lady starts her story one year prior to Rachel s  I wonder how this is going to come together MeganOh  I like this  Megan is  Jess  the woman half of the perfect couple Rachel watches from the train  I love that we get to see her actual life  which is completely different from how Rachel perceives it  Megan is restless in her life  She quits her menial job     now she is free  but she s depressed  She s seeing a head shrinker     she likes him  Hrmmm     where could this be going RachelAh hah  so     Rachel has more problems than we thought  She s a bit obsessive as well as an alcoholic     and she s blacked out     having done something she doesn t remember     now she s hurt  and doesn t know how she got hurt     and there are messages on her phone  There s another connection between Megan and Rachel     unless I ve imagined it  Anna  They both know her  but don t know each other  I wonder if they can help each other out somehow     only one way to find out  MeganHrm     so Megan s half of the story is constantly running a year prior to Rachel s     which means we are seeing the results of what has come to pass in Megan s story through Rachel     and only getting clarification through Megan s parts  These are a couple of desperate women     I wonder if they re going to be able to help each other  or if this will constantly be a relationship at a distance     once Megan may never find out about     except  there s still the possibility of Anna connecting them RachelRachel knows that Jess is Megan now     because of the newspaper  Megan is missing  Hrm     I m still not sure what to think about this story yet  but one thing is for sure  I am hooked  I want to know  I care enough about these ladies to find out what s happening to them  I need to know  MeganMaybe Megan is just polyamourus  Seems like she s struggling more than just that though  RachelThis is the chapter where everything clicked into place for me as to what this story is about  Nothing about the ending in sight yet  but     could Rachel actually HAVE been the one to cause Megan s disappearance  She was blacked out for that period  She HAD been on the street at the time of the disappearance  She was disturbed by whatever she d done at her ex s place     a marriage she is CLEARLY in denial is over     and Anne     turns out  Anna is her husband s new wife  Megan was sitting their child in the beginning of the story  Is it really coincidence that the couple Rachel fantasized about was unknown to her before Megan s disappearance  I guess it is  They moved in after the divorce     it s sad about Rachel not being able to have children  Then she fell apart  And her husband forgot about the  for worse  part of their marriage     which is an unfair assessment  having not heard his side of things  Still     I feel like Rachel needs help more than anything else  She s reaching out  and she s been laughed at      rolls eyes  the cops  What jerks  I m officially committed to this book  I can see why it is so popular  That slow focus on the story was neat  if slightly confusing  Putting me off tilt really helped me get into Rachel s world     and Megan s delayed responses to everything Rachel is going through is interesting     that s why I m afraid we re going to see Rachel involved in all this some how     just as the police suggested MeganMegan s little chapter here doesn t make me feel any better about Rachel s involvement  The fact that there is no hint about it at all feels like a big hint to me  If I am right  Hawkins will be showing us all the things around Megan     and maybe that night Megan WAS going to  escape  her life     then she was in the wrong place at the wrong time     came across Rachel and     well  that serrated mark on Rachel s forehead had to come from somewhere  RachelThis chapter didn t help either  I feel like     now that Hawkins dropped that hint  she s going to do her damnedest to stay away from that idea     because that s the answer  I can feel it  I don t want the answer to be right     but I m not sure if what satisfactory ending could come of this story if she didn t  I wonder if we ll know before we find a body  I have SO much sympathy for Rachel     which is why I am sad that I am SURE she is the reason Megan is missing  I mean     if Rachel did kill Megan thinking it was Anna     that would make everything make sense  AnnaAfter this  I am feeling even more like Rachel did it  Anna saw her on the street  Of course  we still haven t seen the exchange Rachel has with THEM  but     we re seeing all the evidence   biggest frown ever  I must also note  though I am sad for Rachel  I am thoroughly enjoying this story  RachelWh what  What just happened  Someone was arrested     presumably  the man Megan is having the affair with     and Scott   has pulled Rachel into the house  Did she actually go to Scott s  What is happening  MeganIs Scott hitting Megan  Is it a sexual thing  I feel like I missed something     and the affair ISN T with the psychologist  Then who  You know     for awhile  I pondered  what if Megan and Tom      I mean  it would make sense  Tom cheated before  That s how Anna came into the picture in the first place  There is more going on here     hrmmmm  RachelJaysus  and Anna is there  I think Hawkins pulled a one two with Scott pulling Rachel into the house  He s not violent  It s not him     I almost want to start the book over right now to see what I ve missed  I really feel like I ve not got some essential information yet  I wonder if that s because I stopped reading to sleep     hrm AnnaHRMMMMMM  Rachel is looking pretty villainous     too villainous  Have I been duped  Was I supposed to be suspecting Rachel all along  I still feel like Tom might be more involved than I ve considered  I don t blame Anna for feeling how she feels about Rachel  Must keep reading RachelWhy are you doing this  Rachel  You re doing this  because     I think you subconsciously know you killed her  You know it  You haven t forgotten it  It s hiding behind the alcohol  You  Did  It  I remembered what I forgot  Megan was having an affair with the therapist     or so we thought  We ve seen him resist her     and we ve seen them kiss through Rachel s eyes  I bet that kiss wasn t as romantic as Rachel thinks it was  I might be pulling Tom s involvement out of my ass     there s still something about the whole Scott thing I don t understand  He doesn t seem the abusive type  MeganOkay  wait     Megan had a baby     and she maybe  accidentally on purpose drowned the baby  I m not sure this is the kind of book I should read in more than one sitting  Even reading back through my notes  I feel like I ve missed something here again  HRM  RachelI can t stop to say anything more  I don t have anything to add  I need to keep going and see where this leads AnnaDitto RachelAnna DID kill her baby  At least the tabloid confirmed the scene from earlier  I can t stop for long     still think Rachel did it  AnnaReading on   RachelKept reading     MeganI am no longer at work reading this     now I m at home     I was going to wait until tomorrow to finish reading this  but I have to know     and I don t think I ll be able to stop again until I ve reached the end  The Rest of the BookI was right about Tom having an affair with Megan  I was wrong about it being Rachel  and I am pretty sure that little hint in the beginning about it might be Rachel was purposeful  It was there for people like me  People who don t stay in the moment of a story and try to figure it out as they read it  It was so slight  that it s seeming un importance made it important  Turned out it was a crime of passion  and Tom was the killer  Tom almost kills Rachel as well  The end brought this five star book down to four stars  Not because it turned out to be Tom  I like that I was duped  But     we didn t get to see the big climactic confrontation  We get all the build up  All the words  Tom beats Rachel and Anna seems to be going along with Tom s plan     then it cuts away to after the fact  and we get to hear about rather than see how it all turns out  Tom s death  MEH  If there is one thing I hate is going through all the build up for nothing  At the end of the day  this was a really good book  Probably not one I ll read again  and the style did take an adjustment on my part in the first few chapters  but it was very much worth the read  I d recommend it to anyone who reads as much as I do   4 5 stjerneJa  der er vel en grund til postyret En aegte thriller med kuldegysninger ad libitum  Lidt forudsigelig  men er det er okay  den fungerer som den skal   So  everyone was right  If you enjoyed  Gone Girl   I m almost certain you will enjoy  The Girl on the Train   The difference is     Gone Girl  blindsided me with the plot twists  while I figured out the mysteries in  The Girl on the Train  pretty early on  However  this did not keep me from enjoying the book Although she is quite broken and unstable  my favorite narrator in this story is Rachel  She is a raging alcoholic that blacks out frequently  I enjoyed how frustrated I became right along with Rachel when she couldn t remember certain events  She is depicted as chubby  sloppy  and drunk  but you can t help but root for her  The other two female narrators were less likable for me  I suppose I like my characters a bit more flawed I can t say much without spoiling the plot  but  The Girl on the Train  truly was an entertaining read  I read it quickly and never got bored  I m keeping my fingers crossed for a movie  Rachel fahrt jeden Morgen und Abend mit der selben Bahn quer durch London  Dabei kommt sie immer an dem Viertel vorbei  indem sie bis vor zwei Jahren selber gewohnt hat  Die Bahn halt fast immer zur selben Seit an einem bestimmten Signal  Fast jeden Tag beobachtet Rachel an dieser Stelle ein junges Parchen in ihrem Haus  Die beiden sind so glucklich zusammen  einfach das perfekte Paar  Sie erinnern Rachel an ihr fruheres Leben mit Tom  ihrem Ex Mann  als sie noch zusammen mit ihm in dem Viertel wohnte  Nur ein paar Turen von  Jess und Jason    so nennt sie das Paar   entfernt  Tom wohnt immer noch dort  Zusammen mit Anna  seiner neuen Frau  und ihrem gemeinsamen Baby  Anna hat jetzt alles was sich Rachel mit Tom gewunscht hat  aber es hat nicht sollen sein  Rachel fuhlt sich in der Menschenmenge unsichtbar  doch selber sieht und beobachtet sie alles  Eines Tages macht fallt ihr im Garten von  Jess und Jason  etwas Ungeheuerliches auf und sie weiss  dass sie handeln muss     Die Story selber ist recht unspektakular  Spannung bekommt sie durch die gute Erzahlart  Rachels Sicht hat etwas Voyeuristisches durch ihr Beobachten  Rachel hat ein schweres Alkoholproblem  das mit ihrer Vergangenheit zusammen hangt  Das ist aber nicht gleich von vornherein klar  Das etwas mit ihrer Psyche nicht in Ordnung ist  merkt man aber doch bald  Die Stimmung ist sehr gedruckt  Als Person tat mir Rachel schon leid  Ich hoffte immer wieder  dass sie den Absprung vom Alkohol endlich schafft  Neben Rachel wird die Geschichte auch noch aus Annas und Megans Sicht erzahlt  Den Sprungen zwischen den Handlungen kann man als Leser sehr gut folgen  Immer tiefer wird man in das Leben der drei Frauen und ihrer Manner hineingezogen  Durch die Alkoholsucht der Hauptfigur hat die Geschichte etwas Dusteres und Deprimierendes an sich  denn Rachel kann sich an entscheidende Ereignisse nicht erinnern  Das mach die Handlung aber aus  denn als Leser will und muss man naturlich wissen  was sich abspielte und welche Auflosung die Autorin am Ende diesbezuglich parat hat  Selber war ich ziemlich lange auf verschiedenen Losungspfaden unterwegs  Das hat mir gut gefallen  denn es gibt nichts Deprimierenderes an einem Thriller  als wenn man die Auflosung schon sehr fruh erahnt oder weiss  Paula Hawkins hat das in ihrem Debutroman sehr gut gelost  Die Figuren neben Rachel waren eher platt und oberflachlich  bildeten aber einen guten Kontrast zu Rachel  Die am Leben gescheiterte Alkoholikerin auf der einen Seite  die schonen und erfolgreichen auf der anderen Seite Mein Fazit Die Englische Ausgabe liesst sich sehr gut  Die Wortwahl ist nicht zu ausgefallen und man kann der Handlung auch mit nur Fortgeschrittenen Englischkenntnissen gut folgen  Die Handlung selber ist uberschaubar  Rachel handelt oft spontan und unuberlegt  passend zu ihrer Sucht  Uberraschungen gibt es nur zum Schluss der Handlung hin  Die Geschichte lebt eindeutig durch das gescheiterte Leben von Rachel  Alles in allem ganz gut gemacht und ein solider Erstlingsroman  Ero quasi spaventata dai pareri contrastanti riguardo questo romanzo  ma mi sono trovata davanti ad un libro appassionante ed estremamente coinvolgente  L ho letto in meno di 24 ore  forse  a dire la verita  presa anche dall ansia   perche  preparatevi  ne proverete molta    totalmente travolta dalla storia e dalle vicende  Un buon esordio per questa scrittrice  un thriller che intriga e confonde il lettore    ho sempre avuto il dubbio fino a meta  poi mi sono definitivamente orientata verso la soluzione  ma vi assicuro che la scrittrice ha una grande capacita di deviare il lettore e di mescolargli le idee in testa   Rachel  a divorced alcoholic  gets the same train every morning and every evening  On her commute to and fro London the train stops at the same signal every time  This is where she gets to imagine the lives of the people who live next to the train track  that is until the day she sees something  She s not sure what she saw  as she has frequent blackouts  but she knows she saw something  Will Rachel remember what she saw before it s too late The book was quite well written and easy to get into psychological thriller  The story is told by three female narratives   a divorced alcoholic  a pretentious mistress come wife and a cheat  who can you trust  There was two things that linked these three women together  they were all as unreliable as each other and a man  It was easy to spot who the antagonist was fairly quickly but I didn t find that this in any way took away from the reading experience  The author threw in plenty of red herrings to throw you off of the scent The characters were quite unlikeable but I think that s what they were intended to be  Rachel  the alcoholic  the girl on the train  makes you feel many feelings towards her   pity  doubt  frustration  sadness  digest  compassion  This isn t a common thing in books  to feel so many emotions towards one  single  character  I found myself liking Scott an awful lot even though he was mercurial   totally understandable  At one point I did get slightly confused  At one point during Rachel s narative it s evening and then straight after during the same event it s morning with Anna s narrative  Then there was the time where Rachel was told to go over the following evening but the date never changes  It by no means ruined the story but it s usually the small things that make up the big things I wasn t digging the multiple time periods  well two  but I can understand why it was done   to give a bit of back story  I found it quite annoying and tedious to begin with but come halfway and the dates were getting closer it was easy to see how they intertwined and piece together This is definitely a thriller that will keep you wanting to turn the pages  even if the ending did fall a bit flat   it wasn t a very satisfying ending  The author had a fantastic ability of writing a story bound to a short list of characters but being able to make none of them above suspicion  All of the characters at one point thoughout the book was deemed a suspect for what happened  well all of them apart from Anna s little girl  Am I seriously the only person who read this before   Gone Girl    Unique textual structure  Not in love with some elements of the novel but really enjoyed reading the book  I bought The Girl on the Train because it boasted to be an Alfred Hitchcock style  engrossing thriller  I m happy to say that all that boasting was definitely well earned  The Girl on the Train had me on the edge of my seat and turning pages like crazy throughout the book  I was totally absorbed and found it very difficult to put down Rachel Watson is the girl on the train and the main narrator of this mystery  Rachel rides the 8 04 slow train from Ashbury to Euston every day  Every day the train makes the same signal stop and every day Rachel watches the same couple on their patio through the train window  She starts to fantasize about them  She even gives them names  Jess and Jason  They are the happy couple that she and her husband Tom used to be before it all went bad  And now something terrible has happened to Jess and Jason a k a  Megan and Scott and Rachel s life comes crashing down on her The Girl on the Train is Paula Hawkins  first attempt at a crime novel  All I can say to you Paula is great job   I m giving you four stars Fun Fact Paula Hawkins  is a former financial journalist  who has written a couple of other books under a pseudonym  I picked this book up mostly to see what all the fuss was about  Suddenly all of my friends on GoodReads were reading it  I can see why  This is a fun thriller with 3 narrators and one very unreliable protagonist delving into the disappearance of a local woman  The narrators are in turns complex  frustrating and relatable and I wanted all of them to get their acts together  You ll probably enjoy this if you liked Gone Girl but wish it hadn t left you feeling quite so bereft about humanity   I honestly didn t expect to like it as much as I do now  Brilliant   At first it reminded me of Gone Girl  and it does have a similar feel  but it ultimately has a different focus  It s very much about women and the way they sometimes hurt and use each other for the sake of men who don t deserve them  The protagonist  Rachel  was not very likable at first  but she grew on me  In fact  I liked the fact that she was deeply flawed  an alcoholic  overweight  obsessive  she isn t your typical protagonist  not even your typical anti hero  but I could relate to her in ways that I can t usually  I can see myself being like her if I didn t have what I m so blessed to have I guess   It was such a long  long time that I have read a book which I could simply not put down  This was very thrilling  yes  It s like hoping that the answer lies at the next page  or on the next  until you find yourself hanging on to the last few pages  where it finally shows up  It was a good book  well written  but I can t seem to shake off the darkness of the story  I liked this book very much  but will not revisit it again  no matter how many the questions are in my head  Writing 3Story 4 5Enjoyment 4 Hawkins creates a dark mystery thriller in the same vein as  Gone Girl   The unreliable storyteller and changing the perspective between 3 different characters makes for an interesting trip through the tale  The writing is adequate  and does the job of telling the story clearly  but isn t dreamy or poetic like some novels I enjoy  The writing style works for the story though  Hawkins has a pretty good bead on what makes her characters tick  and they felt real and solid to me  Their actions and reactions seemed reasonable  or at least understandable and followed what I understand of human nature  Some thoughtful red herrings had me guessing until about 65  through the book  though I m sure some more astute folks would know exactly what s going on even before any hints are dropped  I don t understand how readers can do that     Sometimes I wake up for a bit around 4 am  and will read for 15 30 minutes until I fall back asleep  This book had me up for at least 2 hours trying to get to the bottom of the mystery  People who enjoy mysteries and psychology or crime thrillers may want to give this a try   I was surprised by how much I disliked the protagonist and how angry I was at her for her decision making  But I think that s why I liked the book  Elicited emotion   The book kept me glued to my Kindle  well written and fast paced  it was a delightful read   and that is coming from someone not much of a thriller fan  I loved the three perspectives in the book  made it harder to pick a favorite character and even harder to judge the ones I didn t like  I also liked a lot the introspective passages  very lively described  real and down to Earth  A great story about the complexity of human nature and the secrets we all bury somewhere  sometime   I was lucky enough to meet the author at a book signing interview  which was so awesome  But obviously that didn t influence my review I finished the book in one sitting  which is always one way to judge the strength of the book  I was sort of dumbfounded  however  reading through some of the reviews for this book   of the negative comments  two dominant strands of thought seemed to be 1 This book is the 50 shades of grey of the crime genre and 2  ERMAGERD the characters were so unlikeable how can anybody like this book what is society coming to MORAL FAILINGS  111    As someone who doesn t read a lot in the crime genre  not liking the gore part of it and also because I end up having vivid nightmares which do not a good sleep make  I can t really judge on the first criticism  I do think we need to stop the line of thinking that anything popular is a sell out to the genre  however But the second criticism is what intrigued me   Disclaimer  there is no correct way to review a book  this is no attack on other reviewers  etc  IMO  dislikable  unreliable characters usually make the book more interesting  Furthermore  it takes more than an unlikable character to rate a book negatively   yeah  they could be incredibly misogynistic  or kick puppies  or compulsively lie  but as long as they re well fleshed out  and there s an interesting plot  and we get insight into their motivations  well  then  I m satisfied  When did we start thinking that the characters have to be good and nice in order for the book to be good  Furthermore  the author said something really interesting in her interview   that we re seeing directly into the character s heads  It s not being filtered through third person   we re right in the thoughts of these characters  And  quite frankly  the human mind is not a great place to be for anybody  We all have dark thoughts  murderous fantasies  judgmental comments that never pass our lips   hell  if we had to be judged solely on the contents of our heads  we d all be in nice padded cells by now  It s actions and words that we should judge the characters by Another factor mentioned  specifically with regards to our MC s unlikeable nature  is the fact that she is an alcoholic  And alcoholism is not a pretty disease  It s not a grandfatherly figure snoring in front of the fireplace after one too many whiskeys  It s an ugly illness that takes away your dignity  self respect  and usually friendships families careers  There is no glamour in it  and I think the author really got this down in terms of the portrayal  In terms of the book itself  I did find the beginning rather slow  but things started moving along fairly swiftly once I got a few chapters in  Personally  I was fascinated by the slow unraveling of these women s lives  It really showed the ugly side of domestic life and human nature   and questions of how well you can ever really know your partner  I called the perpetrator around halfway through the novel   so chuffed I was right  haha   but I see quite a few people guessed it  I have lost control over everything  even the places in my head  Overall  this book was a win for me  An intriguing premise  and an unflinching look at the dark side of our domestic lives  and indeed  the human mind   3 5 stars  I liked this book  I loved how the narrators  especially Rachel  were so unreliable and I never really knew what to believe  I was wrapped right up in it all until today  when I read the last thirty or so pages  Something about the ending just    I don t know  Maybe it was a bit over dramatic  I don t want to give anything away so I ll leave it at that  Still  a fun read for me  and I would like to read more by this author  Update So it s a few months later and this book is still on my brain  Now that the smoke has cleared I have to admit that this is one of the best books I ve read this year I will be reading this book again very soon Original Review Like most people I purchased this book because of all the positive reviews it has been receiving  Although I liked the story  I didn t lose myself in it as I do with other books There was a very gray  depressing vibe with this story and the characters which I thought was very interesting  It was almost as though everyone was a victim so you didn t know who to hate whereas in most stories there is always that one character you loath  even if in the end they re innocent   haha  At times the writing reminded me of Elizabeth Haynes  style as well as some of the events in the novel  not very original   I guess with all the hype about this book I was a bit disappointed that I wasn t as into it as I had hoped  Well  on to the next  Haha  Started off slowly  picked up shortly and ended well  I don t want to be friends with anyone in this book   This book is narrated by three amazing female protagonists who each have their own voice and personality  And fellow feminists  if that s not enough to grab you  be assured that the male characters in this novel who are revealed to be abusive  controlling and or gaslighting pieces of trash  though  not all men    get what they deserve in the end  This book was a well crafted thriller with a good dose of misandry and I enjoyed it very much I want to start giving a trigger warning for books because I think that needs to be done more often  So for this one  a TW for  abuse  alcoholism  domestic violence  gaslighting  death I read this book for the 2015 Popsugar Reading Challenge    a mystery or thriller   Great page turner and a good mystery in how it had you guessing the whole time  I REALLY loved this book  I serve in Salt Lake City once a week as a service missionary volunteer at the LDS  Mormon  Conference Center once a week  originally 4 days  but I used to ride the uta front runner train once a week and so I would also read this book on my kindle on the train going into SL and leaving on the way home  And it was even more fun that way too  I hadn t read Gone Girl at the time but had been on my list so I decided to try this and ended up loving it more than I thought I would  I did later read Gone Girl and honestly I HATED it  But Girl on the Train was soooooooo much better and definitely kept me at the edge of my seat and made train rides even more fun when I got a chance to read it on there  And that end holy crapanoli I did NOT see that coming  Very intense and very well written  I ended up ordering a hard copy of this book so I can get other people hooked and now I m REALLY excited that it s done so well there s going to be a movie on it  So I m even more excited to watch it and the amazing and talented Emily Blunt playing the main character   This is a twist on the amateur detective genre with the person trying to make sense of it all is an alcoholic who has frequent blackouts  This affects her interaction with all the people who she comes in contact with  Rachel travels by train into London each day and during these trips the train stops or slows near a group of houses that back onto the rail line  Rachel creates stories about the people she sees in these houses and back yards  When a woman goes missing from the very house Rachel has fixated on  her initial reaction to what she saw that day is coloured by her drinking  Did it happen or did she imagine it  what does it mean  The chapters are told from the perspective of the key protagonists in the mystery  You need to pay attention to this early another wise you will be extremely confused as to whose point of view you are witnessing There are twists and turns as your opinion of who did it changes with each new revelation  Thoroughly enjoyable book  Every character in this story is        crazy  Yet  I had to keep reading  An interesting opening with a passenger making up stories about the people she sees they the window of the train  but then there is a murder and it all gets complicated  Twists and turns  a good mystery A very entertaining listen  All three narrators did a great job of shifting emotion  creating suspense and fleshing out their character s complexity  The  BBC voice  was particularly well done  It got to be a bit long towards the end but maybe I just wanted the narrators  agony to end  Loved this mystery and especially loved the alternating chapters from each woman s pov  I did not predict the ending  and I always love when an author is able to surprise me     There have been lots of comparisons to Gone Girl  but not having read it I can t comment on the comparison  What I can say is that this book consumed me from the minute I started  The drive to finish it was two fold  one was to find out who did it and the other was to make this  train ride  end  I don t mean I didn t like this book  I really enjoyed but  but it made me very uncomfortable  which is what a good author does  they push us outside our comfort zone   That was creepy        Just read it the book sinks you in from the first page   It s a good one time read  Fast paced   creepy psychological thriller by Paula Hawkins you will not be able to hate or love any character it s a very rear thing   At times I was disgusted with the protagonist   It s a one of a kind novel no one is happy or even close to it     They all are trying to find happiness not realising they already have it   If they just concentrate on their home love the people around them love their   love themselves     And please don t compare it to the gone girl   Spoilers  when Anna touches Rachel in police station and say you take care of yourself I felt that was the most creepy part the novel it gives reader a feeling that everything is not alright things can still go wrong      What makes this novel great is the apt portrayal of psychological behaviours of character  You think you know people around you   your relatives   neighbours   YOUR PARTNER   You never know This was a great read  Fast paced  intriguing  with an interesting cast of unreliable characters who are all messed up in their own special ways  I don t read many mystery stories  but I recommend this novel to any who wants to take a step into the genre  You ll probably be ripping your hair out at some of the awful decisions and mannerisms of these characters  AS I WAS MOST OF THE TIME  but these intricacies are what really make the story feel real  Highly recommend  man  i wish we could give half stars  This would be 4 5 for sure There was a lot of hype around this book  I waited on a waiting list at the library for several months before I had the chance to read it  It did not disappoint  This story is fast paced and keeps you guessing  I don t like to give many details because I don t like to spoil the story  But if you are into murder mysteries  you ll love this     Stunningly clever thriller   What is different about this book   This novel evolves through the eyes of different people who each have their own view of life and events  Each person telling their own story  laying bare their lives to be absorbed by the reader  How then can the truth be pieced together when the facts are fragmented and damaged  A brilliant way to read a tense thriller without being told of the plot and I was left guessing right up until the end It starts with Rachel on a commute to London  Personally for me train a journey is like being in another place and time  and reading this I felt like I was on a train remembering my days of travelling to work with the same people every day  I just want to lean back in the soft  sagging velour seat  feel the warmth of the sunshine streaming through the window  feel the carriage rock back and forth and back and forth  the comforting rhythm of wheels on tracks  Rachel describes her train journeys with such intimacy that I was drawn into her life and travelling with her  This was not just a commute for her it was a journey through her miserable life with a destination still unknown She routinely watches out of the window  especially at the row of Victorian houses where she sees Jess and Jason on the patio in the mornings having coffee  Of course that is not their names  she has built them a fantasy life in her head  I can see Jason and Jess this morning  and my sense of disappointment is acute  Silly I know  I scrutinise the house  but there s nothing to see  She is creating a fantasy relationship in her head but the line between reality is blurring A few doors away she sees Anna   who is real and is now married to her ex husband and living in her house  They have the baby she never had  When Rachel describes the time she knew her husband was cheating on her  Hawkins uses such a beautifully put line  Sometimes its a text or a voicemail message  in my case it was an email  the modern day lipstick on the collar  Oh  I could go on waxing lyrical about the life of Megan and Anna too  but I would would not want to spoil the book for you  let me just say  their lives are equally as interesting as Rachels and very pertinent to the plot The disappearance of Megan starts Rachel hurtling towards self destruction as she tries to find out what happened manipulating her need for attention  recognition  self worth  and maybe something else  As reality and fantasy become confused Rachel knows she has important information that could solve what has happened to Megan  She draws you into this journey with her  with the fear that it is not going to end well Throughout the book Paula Hawkins gives an insight into alcoholism and its effects on oneself and others  This felt so real it was a warning  I have met Rachel   seen her in the pub  and avoided her on the street This is a tense thriller  at a pace which echoes the commute of the train  with imagined scenes from the window with the stops at the lights  I loved each and every character  Rachel got my sympathy and my cringing annoyance   come on pull yourself together girl   Jess  who would have thought she was as complex as that  and her secret   wow thats deep  I wanted to dislike Anna  because she broke up Rachel and Tom s marriage  but you know that she is not that nasty  I enjoyed how the characters of the men were real even the strangers  someone speaks to you  they are in your head somewhere  but you can t quite place them and you are not sure whether you are afraid of them Listen to this line  absolutely the best quote of the book for me  LIFE IS NOT A PARAGRAPH AND DEATH IS NO PARENTHESIS  I recommend it to everyone who loves a different psychological thriller                                     Many thanks to the Publisher for an ARC via NetGalley in return for an honest opinion  Engrossing and a left me a little uneasy  Surprisingly lead to some self

The Sociopath Next Door     As Path Strengthen A Person Too ESCAPE        I couldn t put this book down  It definitely lived up to all the hype   I am truly struggling with writing this review on The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  I don t know how to put in words what I am actually feeling  On one hand  I think I absolutely loved this mystery because it was a great suspense story and a page turner  I truly couldn t put the book down  I read it quickly because I just had to know what was actually going on  However  that being said  what I didn t like was the tediousness of it all  I felt as though we were going over the same thing again and again  Also the characters were completely depressing  odd  and just didn t appeal much to me from the get go  Every single character in this novel is a complete hot mess  All in all it was an entertaining read and great suspense story  The premise of the novel involves a train that the main character Rachel rides to London each day  Rachel is a drunk and lost her job months back but doesn t want her flat mate to know this particular fact so Rachel continues to ride the train daily  This train takes her past her old neighborhood which includes the house that her Ex husband Tom  and family still live in  From the window of the train  Rachel observes not only her old garden that backs up to the tracks  but also the daily activities of another couple who live just down the street from her previous home  In her imagination she has given this couple made up names and has created a complete fairy tale love life for them since she dreams of this for herself one day  Real life  however  cannot live up to her fantasy and the couple does not have the picture perfect relationship that Rachel has conjured up  When a murder occurs  Rachel becomes entangled in the investigation because of what she has witnessed on her daily commute on the train  The Girl on the Train is a dark  haunting and very depressing psychological thriller  This rather gloomy tale is told with intersecting timelines from the viewpoint of three different women Rachel  Anne and Megan  All of these women are unreliable narrators with something to hide which makes for an interesting mystery to say the least  In fact  most of the characters in this novel  including the men  lack authenticity and like I mentioned earlier every character is a hot mess with skeletons in their closets to boot  I truly don t want to continue to give you any more information in regards to the plot  I don t want to spoil it for you so let me just end with this thought  I never saw the ending coming and due to the twists and turns the reader will be drawn in to this novel easily  As always     happy reading my friends     This psychological thriller has had tremendous coverage and praise  I was totally immersed in the reading for over half the book  The main character with all her problems and back story is so well portrayed  little by compelling little  She s a good example of someone readers can identify sympathetically with whilst at the same time feeling some revulsion  The plotline unfolds gradually  more characters emerging and showing their true colours  It was as we approached the denouement that I became disappointed  It was much like a convention Agatha Christie structure at that point  the clever detective revealing all the steps in the crime and its hiding   except that we had to believe a baddie would give away all the secrets  No  Not in character  I had this same disappointment with Gone Girl  All went well and compellingly until a last turn of the screw forced my suspense of belief to come crashing down  Once the events dialogue or interchange can no longer convince in terms of the character so carefully built up during the earlier chapters  the reader is lost as a champion  At least  this one is   The Girl on the Train  by Paula Hawkins  published by Riverhead Books Category   Mystery Thriller Publication Date   January 13  2015If you are looking for something totally different in the mystery thriller category  The Girl on the Train  should do it for you  A psychological thriller that is narrated by 3 young women  all of whom need some kind of help  Rachel is  The Girl on the Train   she is unemployed  she has been through a failed marriage  and is an alcoholic  She takes the train into London everyday to keep people from knowing she has been fired from her job  The train passes the same set of row houses every day and Rachel sees something that will set a series of unfortunate events into motion The three women  Rachel  Megan  and Anna become involved in each others lives  largely due to their relationship with Rachel s former husband Tom who is now married to Anna  Megan who lives down the street has a secret she has been keeping for years and becomes involved when she agrees to help Anna with her baby The story becomes even more convoluted when Anna starts seeing Dr  Kamal  a psychiatrist  This leads to more confusion as he becomes the focal point in a possible murder Although the reader must pay strict attention to each chapter and which girl is the chapter referring to  and also some slow periods in the narration   The Girl on the Train  is a definitely must read as it keeps the reader intrigued throughout the book as it twists and turns to its conclusion   The ending of the book was enough to push this up to 4 stars otherwise I would have given it 3  I mostly pitied felt shame for Rachel then pity left me and all I felt was sadness or some other unknown emotion that I can t describe  The different time stamps lost me and some parts were boring insignificant could have been shorter but all in all it was a good book  I love the different time stamps in a book that make you connect the dots  especially after you ve read it and know the whole story then you can piece together which characters were doing what at certain times  Hence I would need to reread this at some point in the future  Or be lazy and wait for the movie to come out in October What happened to Scott at the end  I m confused  He seems to have disappeared I m glad I read this because it helps me not to be so naive about evil people existing in the real world    And on that note  my next book to read is My Story  I got a feeling I m going to be paranoid for a while  It wasn t quite what I expected from hype  but it didn t disappoint This is a story about three women that cross paths  with tragic consequences  told through each of their POV It s a typical thriller and Yes  I worked out the  who done it  well before the end  However  it moved at a good pace and the author maintained interest for me  the reader Some readers have complained about not being able to distinguish clearly between the three women  If I am completely honest  I agree  but I stayed on track because I read carefully  Had my concentration lapsed there would have been issues  I believe  Perhaps the three women were too alike and needed more differing character traits to set them apart As for many reviewers complaining that the characters were not likeable  Nice people are nice  but flawed people are more interesting  Protagonists do not have to be likeable  at least not for me  I don t need to read about some ideal individual  Overall  it was a good read and better than Gone Girl  which everyone seems to compare it to  Personally  I didn t much like Gone Girl Sergiu Pobereznic  author amazon com author sergiupobereznic great plot twist  I picked up this book because it sounded like an interesting plot   a girl day dreaming about the lives of strangers witnesses something out of the ordinary and how her actions effected the lives of those people but also how her own life was intertwined  Very good story and if you use the whisper sync  the performance was well done  I particularly liked the different point of views of each of the main characters through out the story   This review was originally posted on Between My LinesA few weeks ago I noticed a strange amount of oohhhing and aahhhing about this book   And now I ve read it  I get it   It s definitely one to ohh and ahh over    jumps over on to the bandwagon First Line of The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  She is buried beneath a silver birch tree  down towards the old train tracks  her grave marked with a cairn  My Thoughts on The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins I gave this 4 5 stars so it s a no brainer to figure out that I loved this twisty book    I love psychological thrillers and I have VERY high standards for them   So I m happy to report that The Girl on the Train jumped the bar effortless for me What I loved about The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  It s mysterious   I was a LONG time figuring out what was going on and just how the three main characters all fitted together It s familiar   I loved the simple concept of a girl on the train making up stories in her head about a house she sees every day   Of course it s not that simple but that theme just really appealed to me as I m always ridiculously nosey when I get glimpses into people s lives too It s intriguing   Once you start  I m sorry but you will probably be a goner until you re finished it   The way the book is set up is just really enticing and makes you want to read on just one more chapter to see just what is really going on   And then one more    The characters are realistic and I was pulled head first into their knotty  complicated lives   It s not pretty  it s not heart warming but it is compulsive reading   I love intense  dark characters and this book has those in abundance The ending nailed it as a great read for me   I loved the tone of it and it worked perfectly       What I didn t love about The Girl on the Train     I got nothing   I loved it all I don t rate it as high as I rated Gone Girl as I just didn t admire the prose as much in this one   It s still fab but the language doesn t dazzle me with cleverness the way Gone Girl did   And I know I won t remember it as long Overall I thought this one was an absorbing read with fully fleshed out characters and I loved how mysterious and twisty it was  Who should read The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  I d highly HIGHLY recommend this to fans of psychological thrillers especially if you like characters whose lives are full of shadows   Fans of Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn   Before I Sleep by S J Watson and The Secret Place by Tana French should also really enjoy this one Thanks to  Random House UK and NetGalley for giving me a copy of this book in exchange for an honest  unbiased review     Paula Hawkins nos entrega una de las mas interesantes novelas de misterio que he leido Lo mas interesante es desarrollo y la estructura que para el lector sucede de la misma manera que para la protagonista casi a ciegas  sin saber que pasa  con trozos de informacion  sin saber bien hacia donde apuntan las sospechas y que la hace mas inquietante y provocativa Contada con tres voces totalmente definidas  Hawkins nos va envolviendo poco a poco en este relato intrigante  que aunque al principio baja de nivel un poco  cierra de manera potente y magnifica  Twisty  twisty  twisty  Love a good who done it that is written well enough that just about anybody could have done it    2015 Reading Challenge  week 10  a mystery or thriller This page turning psychological thriller is told from the perspective of three women  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  in alternating chapters and is quite the charcter study  Rachel is a divorced alcoholic who takes the train into London each day  pretending to go to a job from which she was fired months before  On its route  the train pauses briefly at the same spot and Rachel observes a young married couple on their terrace and fantasizes about their happy life together  so unlike her own  One day Rachel is shocked to see the woman kissing another man  How COULD she  A day or two later  Rachel reads a news report about a woman named Megan Hipwell who has disappeared and realizes from the photo that Megan is the woman she has been observing  Should she report what she has seen to the police Just down the street from Megan lives Tom  Rachel s ex husband  with his current wife  Anna  and their baby  They live in the house that Rachel and he shared during their marriage  much to Anna s displeasure  Worse  whenever Rachel is drunk  she harasses them with late night phone calls and drop bys  to the point that Anna wants to take out a restraining order against her  Their lives become increasingly tangled as the search for Megan intensifies while Rachel s life continues to spiral downward from her drinking problem  Figuring out the  whodunit  isn t hard but this doesn t detract from the page turning thrills  What a debut  Can t wait to read more from this writer   SPOILER ALERT An enjoyable read  There s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home  From the train Rachel sees a couple in one of the houses of her previous neighbourhood She was married then happily In apartment number 15 she and Tom her then husband were living a good life until she found out he was a cheater and that concluded their married life previously hit by problems because of her not getting pregnant and wanting a child so much But now everyday from the train which takes her to work she sees what she and Tom could have been a perfect couple there s this comfort to her because she projects herself into Jess the name she gives to the girl she sees She s happy for them But then one day Jess disappears and Rachel has an idea why The day before she saw her with another man kissing She starts to hate her How could she do that to Jason I do believe the author describes perfectly what we could call empathy she feels deluded that Jess cheated on Jason because she saw how she felt how happy she was with Jason she felt it herself that eluding happiness Apparently seeing is not always believing There s something more than what meets the eye Rachel tells the police what she saw and an investigation begins trying to find out the missing girl  One for sorrow Two for joy Three for a girl Four for a boy Five for silver Six for gold Seven for a secret Never to be told  SPOILER ALERT Somewhere in the middle I made my guesses 1  Tom killed her he cheated on Rachel he could as well have cheated on Ana with Megs the nanny girl Typical 2  Ana killed her she finds out about the affair and keeps silent until she finds the perfect timing to kill her Then she might have planned to blame it on Rachel the ex alcoholic girl who couldn t even remember what she saw on the day of the crime   But unfortunately the author doesn t go that dark she keeps it simple  3 Rachel killed her she felt envious of their happiness she wanted to be Megs because she liked Scott creepy  By choosing the first option the author decides to keep a more low profile for her characters Ana and Rachel are normal people Rachel abused by Tom apparently she was lied about what she did when she was drunk a couple of times and Tom continuously treated her like nothing Ana is the typical  other girl  she feels happy somebody left someone and married her because she apparently has some low self esteem issues going on The darkest one is Megan who also has an affair with her psychiatrist lived with a man while still a teen and accidentally killed her baby The author chooses to make Tom the killer which is a predictable choice Then in the end Ana and Rachel are accomplices one calls the police and the other keeps quiet about the knife stabbing I felt it missed the psychological depth of Gone Girl  to which the book is often compared  even the creepiness but it is still enjoyable I felt it could have had more potential then what it becomes in the end but still it s an engaging book makes you think sort out possibilities and pathways The real discovery here is a meditation on the lives of others and how little we know about people we share our lives with  read on the cruise to Alaska  Interesting structure of back and forth among three women  one a depressed alcoholic  one the victim and one the wife of the ex husband of the depressed alcoholic  I have to be careful not to give too much away  the perspectives switch and information is revealed gradually building to the climax  The writing is very good  ie use of words and phrasing  Not a 5 star but better than a 3  Surprised that Liz gave it a 3  but to each their own  I recommend it  I just smashed my way through this book  which is deservedly getting a lot of comparisons to Gillian Flynn s hit novel Gone Girl  They re both told in alternating perspectives but TGOTT has 3 different voices compared to the couple s voice of GG  Both are tense throughout too  The only real difference apart from the story they tell is the endings  GG was strong all the way til the twist at the end  which I thought was meh  I seen the twist coming in TGOTT early but what I didn t see was the twist after the twist  Yeah  it s getting comparisons to GG but I think it should be the other way around  TGOTT is a superior read  IMO   THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a dark  haunting and depressing psychological thriller  but it s incredibly effective thanks to the writing skills of author Paula Hawkins  Rachel is a divorced woman who would do anything for a drink  and like a lot of folks consumed by a love affair with the bottle  one might call her a victim of circumstances  Her husband Tom had an affair that resulted in a pregnancy  He divorced Rachel  married the  other woman  and now all three  husband  wife and child  are happily ensconced in the house that was once Rachel s The train that Rachel rides to London each day takes her past her old neighborhood  From the window of the train she observes not only her old garden that backs up to the tracks  but also the daily activities of another couple who reside down the street from her previous home  In her imagination she has given the couple names and has created a fairy tale love life for them  Real life  however  cannot live up to her fantasy and the couple does not have the picture perfect relationship that Rachel has concocted  When a murder occurs  Rachel becomes entangled in the investigation because of what she has witnessed on her daily commute This rather bleak story with intersecting timelines is told from the viewpoint of three different women Rachel  Anne and Megan  All the women are unreliable narrators with something to hide  In fact  most of the characters in this novel  including the men  lack veracity  and are a self serving and unsympathetic group with plenty of skeletons in their closets Lest I continue and divulge too much of the plot  let me just say that the twists and turns in the story are many and readers will be easily drawn in  making it easy to devour this book in one afternoon  Good thriller  but no Gone Girl  Everyone wants to be the next Gillian Flynn  but Gillian Flynn isn t finished being Gillian Flynn  De mannen in dit boek zijn klootzakken  de vrouwen vond ik nogal zwak  passieloos en dus vrij oninteressant  En toch wilde ik weten hoe het afliep en kon ik moeilijk stoppen met lezen  Ik heb regelmatig gedacht dat het nu toch eindelijk maar eens vooruit mocht gaan  want ik was de personages nogal beu  Maar ik wilde weten wat er was gebeurd  Als je een boek wil uitlezen ondanks zo n frustraties  is het toch wel een geslaagde thriller  nee  Outstanding mystery with a great voice  although initially the number of characters as I listened to it on Audible was confusing The main character is depressed  living a lie  but you are held at bay  unsure who is the villain  even as you doubt the main character  Lovely read  great tension  although it has a slow reveal that will drive some readers listeners crazy  It s worth the ride  Enjoy  Uperokhe ploke  endiapheron oi kharakteres kai enas phonos musterio    Ti allo na thes apo ena biblio       WELL  For my first fiction book in over a decade  this was a great one to start with  I could NOT put it down and read it in one evening  The characters are pretty much all distasteful so there s no one really to identify with  You end up being taken along for the ride simply because the plot is so compelling  It reads kind of like a movie  and apparently will be a movie soon   and definitely has a Hitchcockian flair to it  Has some bad language and sexual content  The movie will surely have to be R  I finished this book in 3 days because I could not put it down  It was so interesting to see the story from 3 points of view  Rachel  the alcoholic ex wife of Tom who passes by her old house while taking the train into London to a non existent job that she was fired from but hasn t told anyone yet  Megan  Scott s wife who lives a few houses down from Rachel s old house  and who Rachel imagines a whole life for Megan   Scott  who she thinks of as Jess and Jason  until the day Megan turns up missing  and Anna  the new wife of Tom nemesis of Rachel who not only lives in Rachel s old house and stole Tom away from her  but also gave Tom a child  There is so much going on with each of these characters that the author just briefly touches on  but it s enough to let you know what s going on in their minds  their old lives  etc  Very well written with the transition between POV s never getting me confused or annoyed because I can t keep up  The mystery of what happens to Megan was a shocker   have to admit I did not see that coming  But then once you know  the little things start to add up and you realize how well this book was developed  As for Rachel  at first you want to slap her and say  Get your life in order   But as the book continues  you see that maybe not everything is her fault and there are suitable reasons for why she s in her situation  The author provided an ending for all the characters   that s important to me  I really don t like to be left hanging trying to figure out where what a character went next  Very good book  highly recommend   Excellent read  Great story  very suspenseful  Definitely kept me on my toes towards the second half of the book  Muy recomendable  quiza un poco previsible  pero con un estilo narrativo increible Find this and other Reviews at InToriLex  Actual Rating Three Point Five Stars This book has been compared over and over to Gone Girl but I find it very different  Rachel is very sad and a self destructive character  her plans are driven by obsession  Gone Girl focused on a sociopath determined to get revenge on her husband  There both good thrillers  but in The Girl on a Train you go through many circumstances where characters act out of anger and emotion but none carry out well planned actions   I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts  Who was it said that following your heart is a good thing  It is pure egotism  a selfishness to conquer all   These people are broken in this book  Ms  Hawkins does a great job of exploring characters and making you feel that they are real people  making real decisions   I do think that some parts of this book was drawn out and the build up towards the climax took too long  While I enjoyed reading the book and progressing with the plot  some of it read like filler and came off as boring because of it Bad relationships can really mess a person up   I think many people don t empathize with those ending relationships  until they feel it in their own lives  All three of the women who narrate the book  are dealing with relationships where they are trying to find happiness  Unfortunately they all lose pieces of themselves while trying to create perfect relstionships  I could really identify with how sometimes you can feel overwhelmed in relationships and have to fight to take care of yourself first   It s impossible to resist the kindness of strangers  Someone who looks at you  who doesn t know you  who tells you it s OK  whatever you did  whatever you ve done  you suffered  you hurt  you deserve forgiveness    If you enjoy thrillers this was definitely a good one  that has a fast moving plot  This gives great insight into how people can morph and manipulate   If you think somethings off  your probably right  I did not see the ending coming  but it was definitely a satisfying conclusion  Totally recommend this to people who like smart thrillers  I enjoyed this a lot  I did guess the ending before I got there  but only about 3 4 of the way through  For a person who prides herself in her ability to guess plot twists before they come    Pretty good   An addictive  suspenseful page turner  3 5 to 4 stars The blurb above notes that this book is  compulsively readable  and I think that statement best sums up how I felt about this novel  I just couldn t put the book down despite some issues that affected my overall reading experience  I wanted to know what happened  how the mystery would unravel  how secrets would tumble out  Author Paula Hawkins did a good job of keeping me on edge as the novel unwound in an almost cinematic fashion  The story was always in motion with shifting timelines and questionable stories recounted by untrustworthy characters  Imagination and reality dueled as I sought the truth to the events that led to the disappearance of one of our three female protagonists   I am not the girl I used to be  I am no longer desirable  I m off putting in some way  It s not just that I ve put on weight  or that my face is puffy from the drinking and the lack of sleep  it s as if people can see the damage written all over me  can see it in my face  the way I hold myself  the way I move   We first meet Rachel  the girl on the train  who has lost her job  lost her husband and exists most regularly in a drunken stupor  To escape her sad reality  she revels in a fantasy where two people live an idyllic life  Two strangers whom she sees every day as she glimpses out of her window on the train  But one day  everything changes and she finds herself caught up in a chilling mystery where her past  present and fantasy worlds collide   I have lost control over everything  even the places in my head   We also meet Megan  half of the happy duo Rachel sees from her faraway perspective on the train  Megan is happily married to Scott  or at least that s what Rachel surmises  But in reality  Megan s life is not what it seems  and chapter by chapter  we learn just how much her facade hides  Down the street from Megan  live Rachel s ex husband Tom and his wife  Anna  And it is on this street  behind the walls of these homes  that the story takes flight  connecting the lives of these five people in the most twisted  unexpected ways   There s nothing so painful  so corrosive  as suspicion   The crux of the story revolves around the disappearance of Megan Hipwell  and what happened on the night she disappeared  The same night Rachel was so drunk that she stumbled home bleeding  her memories swiped clean What happened  Who was responsible  What role  if any  did Rachel play To me  the novel had many strengths  It was absolutely impressive as a debut novel  The plot was strong  hinting at a myriad of possible scenarios  Hawkins is masterful at delivering three point of views  giving us just enough to confuse us and entice us    keep us on edge  I loved how she explored the fallibility of memory and the power of imagination and suggestion  Each of the characters in the story is at best unreliable and deceptive  and at worst  a murderer hiding in plain sight The first half of the story felt slower to me  perhaps lingering too much on certain aspects  but the second half of the book moved much more quickly  The biggest issues I had were with the female characters    they frustrated me  particularly Rachel  I m not saying the characterization was not done well  it s just that these women were often irritating  Rachel especially made horrible decisions  pushing herself into situations she had no business being in and on top of that  she was drunk most of the novel  I completely understand that was likely the intent  evidencing the unreliability of her persona  but it unfortunately curbed my reading enjoyment  In fact  her story felt very tragic and sad  and I couldn t help but feel the very thing she detested most    pity Overall  the novel is definitely well written  richly imagined and masterfully twisted  despite the frustrating choices of our heroines  The end was fabulously executed and I was really happy with the conclusion  I listened to the story on Audible  which was particularly great for discerning between the various POVs  If you re a fan of suspense  this is definitely a story worth reading   The holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mould yourself through the gaps       Follow Vilma s Book Blog   Website   Facebook    Twitter  WOW  The girl on the train was something else  While it is in the same vein as Gone Girl  it is really different in terms of how it the story is executed and presented  I like having the multiple POVs and flashbacks and the overall thick web of mystery that the author created  I loved the main character and all the complications that surrounded Rachel  Also the ending was well done and amazing  Quick paced  well written  dark and mysterious characters  and superbly written plot  Well done   Um livro que se le muito bem apesar de  no inicio  eu ter demorado a entrar no ritmo da narrativa  Digamos que este tipo de historia nao e o que mais me atrai mas como esta bem escrito  acabou por ser dificil pousar o livro sem matar a curiosidade de saber o autor do crime As personagens estao muito bem descritas  ambiguas e dificeis  como devem ser num policial Mas nao e nem um pedrada no charco nem um premio nobel da literatura  Os  dois milhoes de copias vendidos em pouco tempo  devem de ser resultado de uma boa estrategia de maketing  E  simplesmente  um bom thriller policial  Aconselho a leitura para os apreciadores do genero  This is one of those books that I found it hard to like any of the characters  but  pardon the pun  like a train wreck  it was hard to look away  and I felt compelled to learn what would happen  I was also compelled to find out why  oh  why these women were such a  hot mess  Between an alcoholic  a liar and a cheat  who can you trust while they are telling their story  That was a clever approach to a book  The unrelenting bleakness of Rachel s situation was difficult to bear  The characters were consistently  counting my blessings  difficult to relate to  dealing with a multitude of serious dysfunction from addiction  infidelity  murder  abuse  obsession  mental illness and life altering guilt  But I read it to the end to find out what happened   very clever of the author  if you ask me  Read this mostly on the plane to Portland last week and really enjoyed it  Well  for the most part  It s characters  plot  and outlook are all super bleak and kind of depressing  but I enjoyed the twists and turns and the writing itself  Lo sospeche desde un principio pero igual me gusto  la historia no es tan suspenso o para mi no lo fue tanto  quizas no me enfoque en eso porque me gustaron los personajes  Also  quotes   Let s be honest  women are still only really valued for two things  their looks and their role as mothers  I m not beautiful  and I can t have kids  so what does that make me  Worthless    You re like one of those dogs  the unwanted ones that have been mistreated all their lives  You can kick them and kick them  but they ll still come back to you  cringing and wagging their tails  Begging  Hoping that this time it ll be different  that this time they ll do something right and you ll love them  You re just like that  aren t you  Rach  You re a dog   Tambien el final cos blood  Me encanta la sangre en los finales  Interesting premise about a woman who rides the train to and from work everyday and what she sees during her commute  I like that it was told from the POV of three women  the main character being an unreliable narrator at best  It was enjoyable trying to figure out what did and didn t actually happen  There are quite a number of reveals that occur during the book  but I think my favorite was one of the first  when we find out that one of the houses she sees everyday on her train ride used to be hers  A good psychological thriller that will keep the reader guessing  A good mix of mystery and an unreliable narrator   Pass the wine please  On second thought     Alcoholism at its best  Shaken not stirred with Loneliness  Despair  Betrayal  Child endangerment  murder  murder  murder and mass transit  There is no end to the shadows that are creeping in from all the possibilities of Rachel s black outs  With a glass of wine in hand and this book in the other I found my self screaming  WELL WHAT REALLY HAPPENED    This woman gets black out drunk and cannot grasp reality for a second to save her life  I just can t deal with wanting to shake the booze out of a fictional character just to ask her how the story ends  4 stars   and I d read it again   I found this book to be a compelling read  After a slow start the pace picked up and things started moving along rather nicely I understand the premise of flipping back and forth between characters but I found myself often having to look back to see which day it was and who was talking I kind of had a love hate relationship with the 3 women  Rachel was pretty pathetic and at times I wanted to throw the book against the wall  She kept doing so many stupid things and just could not mind her own business  In the end  I do not know if her actions were helpful or not    would the mystery have been solved without her butting in It was just frustrating to keep reading about these vulnerable women who kept making one mistake after another and could not seem to stand up for themselves  The set up for the main plot was a little slow  but once I figured out who Rachel was and how her life intersected with the other characters  it was a very good mystery  I stayed up WAY too late into the night to finish this one  Really liked this book  It s kind of like Gone Girl  But if everyone was a lunatic and untrustworthy  So kind of exactly like Gone Girl   Really good  Not one redeeming character in the novel that adeptly points out the flaws in everyone despite how they present or are perceived  The plotting was tense and sometimes uncomfortable and it helped push you along  Although the ending was predictable it was fun getting there  My only knock was how late Anna as a narrator popped in   I hated Gone Girl and am not really sure I loved this book  But I read it in one day and the author did a great job of keeping me guessing  What more can you ask for in a suspense novel  I look forward to seeing what this author has to offer in the future  As befitting the psychological thriller genre  The Girl on the Train explores the powers and limitations of perception in its three morally ambiguous female characters  whose lives intersect throughout the book in seen and unforeseen ways  Rachel occupies the role of protagonist and we see much of the story through her eyes  but the other two women  Megan and Anna  also have their own chapters  In combination  the multiple points of view sculpt a three dimensional portrayal of the events that unfold and  as the plot unravels  teases the twist that comes at the end  Up until the final chapters  I thought the character development of Rachel and Megan were very good   there was no sugar coating or idealizing   they felt like real human beings in the raw  By comparison Anna was really flat and simple  which was disappointing  but I am still glad her perspective was in the mix  It added to the story in crucial ways  and  let s face it  you can t have a good modern book about human psychology and experience without a basic bitch in the casting   Jokes  Anyways   The ending let me down  The author did such a great job building her female characters  but Tom s sudden importance at the end steals all their thunder  even Anna gets stiffed   I couldn t help but think  of course it s just this one asshole ruining the lives of three women   And naturally for this guy to fit the bill  for us readers to be convinced of his mega assholery  he is turned into not just a cheat  but a manipulator  pathological liar and abuser of women  You start to get an inkling of his shady ways in the middle of the book  beyond being a cheater   but then it hits you all at once at the end like an avalanche  While I anticipated Tom s true part to play in the plot  I still was like  Holy shit  Tom  Where did all your crazy come from  I appreciated Rachel as a seriously flawed  gritty individual  I didn t need or want Tom to make her a more  sympathetic  character  as is what happens when we find out he was manipulating Rachel all along into thinking she did terrible things while she was drunk  And when his second wife  Anna  discovers he s been lying to her  we gradually we see the signs of a fledgling spouse snoop and alcoholic in her  too  Are we to believe that he turned our unconventional heroine Rachel into a sad  lonely  hot mess alcoholic with stalker esque hobbies  along with his second wife That s too much power for a character who only nominally mattered up until the final chapters of the book  Although I hated the role Tom s character played to tie up all the plot strings  I enjoyed his symbolic death by corkscrew  It was no symbolic accident that Rachel aimed for his throat   page turner I had to read this story for a book club that I belong to  Everyone said this was like Gone Girl and since I never finished that book I did not have high hopes for this one  This book is told from multiple POVs and it move back and forth through time     that is why it doesn t receive 5 stars from me  This story was intense  suspenseful and was always making you want to slap the daylights out of the main character  For a story to pull that much emotion out of me has to be pretty good  It kept me on the edge of my seat until about 90  thru and then it was one heck of a ride from there   Great read  Lots of twists and turns  good book  Whew  That was a good ride  When a book takes away your life and makes you forget about the real life around  you can trust the book to be the best  When you read this book  you end up giving up on your real life duties and chores and just snuggle in the bed with this book and steaming cup of coffee  And when you finish the book  you question everyone and everything around you  like is anything even real The Girl On The Train is told from the perspectives of three women  three mentally unsettled women and each of them has a story to tell about their lives revolving around one guy  An alcoholic who lost her husband to another woman  the other woman who is living happily with the man as his wife  but has a lot of secrets buried within and the cheat who ruins the lives of not one but many  As the three women tell their stories  what unravels is a strange story with broken characters and their distressed lives When Rachel sees outside the train on the way to her commute  she sees a happy couple  who she names  Jess and Jason  and realizes how happy she is for them  even though her life is nothing close to theirs   There s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home    But  the truth is  Jess is actually cheating on her husband  and when Rachel sees her kissing another guy from the train  she is pulled into their lives in a way she can never get out  This book takes various twists here and there  but when it reaches the end  everything stops making sense  and that is exactly why I love this book This book is compared to Gone Girl on many platforms and when I started reading  I couldn t make the connection  But  when you close the book after finishing it  you realize it played with your mind like no other book could ever do  I can also understand why people seem to hate it  To a person who loves happy endings  and fluffy romances  this book can never be likeable  This book doesn t involve a happy ending  it only shows the truth  that we all broken in the end  FIND IT ON MY BLOG Well  here I go jumping on the bandwagon for this book  I was on hold for MONTHS at my library to get it  Some may have just given in and purchased it  but in my experience when EVERYONE is recommending a book and the holds are long  I usually don t end up liking it  Not because I want to be different  but I guess my expectations are so built up and nothing can ever live up to that But maybe the opposite happened here  I was expecting it to be crap  not nearly as good as everyone says  And then    it was pretty damn good  actually  Not perfect  but it kept me guessing and kept me sucked in    both excellent characteristics of a book for me It was a little confusing at first  having two of the characters in one time period and the third in the past  but I adjusted eventually  I loved how unreliable Rachel was as a narrator and it kept making me wonder what she had actually done  although I felt the alcoholic blackouts were sort of gimmicky and not portrayed well  I loved how our view of Megan changes over the course of the book as we learn more about her  from perfect wife to   well  not so much  Though I also felt really badly for her and her past  I didn t have quite the negative reaction toward her as seemed to be expected   in my view  it was an accident  The real crime was covering it up And I did not see the ending coming at all  but then looking back  I felt that I should have  Or at least  COULD have  This is a sign of a well written book to me Anyway  very enjoyable  If you like unreliable narrators and lots of suspense  I highly recommend this one  Am looking forward to more books by this author Great read   would recommend  I read this book in one sitting on a Sunday afternoon  It s been a very  very long time since I ve read a book in one sitting  Not that I never thought about putting it down and returning later  it s just every time I did  I would come to the end of a chapter or POV section and find that I just couldn t That  in and of itself  merits a four star rating from me It s taut and intense  I figured out the true killer early on  and then spent almost the rest of the book second guessing myself  I questioned A LOT of things  If you don t like a book that makes you question almost everything  then go ahead and skip this one The comparisons to Gone Girl will be endless   unlikeable characters  multiple POV s  unreliable narrators   but other than that  I did not feel like I was reading Gone Girl redux  In all  I found it a highly enjoyable read and a great way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon  You won t like any of the characters in this novel  but much like the documentary  Making a Murderer   you ll feel compelled to know how this story fits together and how everyone is involved  I didn t see the ending twists coming until about 2 3 through the novel  so it wasn t predictable for me  I thought almost certainly that Rachel was schizophrenic and that we would discover at the end that she was multiple characters in the novel  Fast paced and well written  I m anxious to see how the movie adaptation will turn out The last chapter was so Hollywood for me that it almost ruined the whole book  but I m sure it will make for great cinema   Read my full review here  http   mimi cyberlibrarian blogspot c    Rachel s life is a mess  She s divorced  jobless  alcoholic  She gets on the train every morning from her London suburb and wanders the city until work hours are over  when she returns to the flat she shares with a friend  She can t bear to tell her friend that she has no job  One of the daily train stops is opposite the house that she shared with her husband Tom  who now lives there with his new wife Anna and their baby  Every day she stares at the house where she feels her life disintegrated  She also stares at a neighboring house and fantasizes about the young couple that lives there  creating an entire life scenario for them  When the young wife  Megan  disappears  Rachel realizes that she has important information that must be shared   Rachel  however  is not the only unreliable narrator of the enfolding story  Anna tells the story from her point of view  as does Megan  They are not the only unreliable people involved in the story  Rachel s ex husband Tom as well as Megan s husband Scott may also be unreliable witnesses to the unfolding events  To tell any more of the plot would spoil the fun  The emphasis of the The Girl on the Train is on the mysteries that surround the people that we think we know  even our spouses  The reviewer in the Boston Globe says that  Hawkins emphasizes the parallels among these three ostensibly different women  and close the book with the knowledge that they share  as we might  unexpected affinities with people they pass by each day  those who they see but will never truly know   Rachel interjects herself into the lives of the people at that train stop in ways that most people would not do  nor would they think of doing  That doesn t keep the majority of us from fantasizing a bit about what it would be like to live in some other place or some other house or with some other person  Does that make us unreliable witnesses to the events of our own lives On a subway ride in New York City several years ago  I sat next to a young couple who were making out rather voraciously  Frankly  it was pretty disgusting  The man on the other side of the couple couldn t stand it anymore and complained loudly to the young man  who jumped up and yelled threateningly into the face of the complainer  When he finally calmed down  he sat back down and ranted on and on under his breath  until the complaining passenger got off the train  What was fascinating to me was not this scene  which was definitely a bit scary  but the reaction of the woman who was sitting opposite me  She was about my age and must have recognized that I was a tourist  She watched me intently through the entire incident  trying to decipher my reaction to the unfolding scene  She was trying to look at the world through my eyes  What is reality  and what is our perception of reality I was reminded of a beautiful mansion on the lake shore in Duluth  my home city  Every time I walked by it as a girl  I pretended that I lived there  The lawn  the gardens  the porches looking over the lake  magnificent  Then  one night  the owner was murdered by her son in law on the main stairway in the house  Suddenly  the house became a tourist attraction  and the beautiful fantasy became an ugly reality  Everyone has compared The Girl on the Train with Gone Girl  I think that they are similar only because of the unreliable narrators  I enjoyed them both  although I think that Gone Girl twisted up my mind a bit more than The Girl on the Train  Read them and see what you think  The Girl on the Train Book Review I devoured Girl on the Train in about four hours yesterday  It s addicting  keeps you questioning what is going on and very similar to that of Gone Girl  Rachel rides the train every day pretending to go to work after she loses her job  Each day she see s a couple whom she names Jess and Jason  When something strange happens she can t help but feel as though she must tell the police  Diving deeper and deeper in Rachel gets stuck in a whirlwind of events  Man  these are some dark characters  Rachel with her drinking and stalking habits  Megan with her secrets  and Anna even has a scary background  People that want to like their characters may not enjoy this story as much because it is dark  Though I did love the book and it kept me wanting to read more I have to say the ending was a bit disappointing and for me  a tad predictable  I wasn t shocked  It s obvious why this book has sold millions of copies world wide and has people talking  Thrillers seem to be a huge hit today  This is a highly addictive psychological thriller  with the most unreliable narrator and it is filled with characters whom you struggle to like  However once started you then have to finish it  I did have my suspicions and they were correct although I did like the final twist to the tale  3 and a half stars really  Despite not liking any of the characters  I liked 100  more than Gone Girl  Somewhere between a 3 5 and 4   This book is crazy and I m exhausted  Impressive thriller mystery novel with one of the best closing sentences in my recent memory  This book will be made into a movie within the next five years  Guaranteed   Por este livro estar no  1 de vendas do nosso pais despertou me a curiosidade  Ia um pouco a medo porque criei bastantes expectativas  Nao sendo uma obra de arte  e um livro muito interessante e viciante  Todas as personagens tem os seus demonios  demonstram os seus  podres  e foi isso que me cativou mais nesta historia  E um thriller nada previsivel e que se le bastante bem  Recomendo   update  I LITERALLY JUST WROTE A HUGE REVIEW AND IT SPONTANEOUSLY DELETED WHEN I UPLOADED IT  WHAT     I WAS KINDA PROUD OF IT TOO  I remember admitting it to myself  Thinking the thought and not dismissing it  embracing it  I wanted it  I wanted to be with Jason  I wanted to feel what Jess felt  when she sat out there with him  drinking wine in the evening  I forgot what I was supposed to be feeling  i ignored the fact that at the very best  Jess is nothing but a figment of my imagination  and at the worst  Jess is not nothing  she is Megan   she is dead  a body battered and left to rot  Worse than that  I didn t forget  I didn t care   So it starts off with Rachel  who is an alcoholic   Drunk Rachel sees no consequences  she is either excessively expansive and optimistic or wrapped up in hate  She has no past  no future  She exists purely in the moment   Rachel takes the same train every day  That s just how it is  She never really has anywhere to go to  but it s not necessarily about the destination itself  It s about the journey it takes to get there  Over the months Rachel soon becomes invested in the lives of Jess and Jason  whom are residents in a home that her train makes a stop near  She s build fictional lives for them in her mind  including names  occupations  pasts  Fantasies  It s as if she feeds off this story like happiness  their fairy tale lives  Because surely if they re blissfully happy  then she can be too  She would never dream of approaching them  That is  until two things happen  First  she sees Jess kissing another man that is not Jason  She feels that this is a direct betrayal to her  as if she should be just as angry as Jason would be if he d known  Then  soon after  Jess   who is actually Megan Hipwell   goes missing  It is these two things that open up doors for Rachel  They offer her something to pass her days with  They offer her a purpose  They offer her a semblance of a life that she long ago thought she d lost to the bottom of a bottle   I was so glad to have a purpose that I stopped thinking about the reality   As the story continues it isn t too soon before you realize that she can t let go of her ex husband  Tom  whom she still shares the same last name with  He cheated on her for another woman  Anna  who moved in straight after Rachel  bearing his child  I couldn t help but be really sympathetic and sad every time she wistfully described the home she chose and lost  or the child she desperately wished for but was never granted   He never understood that it was possible to miss what you never had  to mourn for it  Strangely  though  I always found myself really excited whenever Anna s few POV s came along  It sounds bad but  honestly  all of these characters are just as messed up as each other  Anna just happened to be a little more interesting   view spoiler  My only problem was with the ending  Don t get me wrong  it was still very good  and I had not foreseen it  necessarily  However  due to many comments and observations made throughout the novel  it was predictable  Right until the final sentence I was anticipating some crazy revelation that didn t come  Although the ending was still very satisfying   hide spoiler  This book was addictively compulsive  and by the first sentence I was enthralled  and the tinniest bit obsessed   The characters were well grounded and thought out  and the plot very intriguing  It ll mess with your head a little  and confuse you even more  But that s okay  because that s what we want   view spoiler   I get into bed and turn the lights out  I won t be able to sleep  but i have to try  Eventually  I suppose  the nightmares will stop and I ll stop replaying it over and over and over in my head  but right now I know that there s a long night ahead  And I have to get up early tomorrow morning  to catch the train    hide spoiler   I was immediately pulled into this neurotic woman s life  I can see why a lot of people disliked the book  it is chock FULL of entirely unlikable characters  There wasn t a single character I liked  But damn  this story  The main narrator is completely unreliable and the other two are wearing blinders so you have to file away certain things while reading each POV  I thought this was a great mystery and was a little more than halfway through the book when things started falling into place for me  I was pretty fooled for the first half  This had the Gone Girl feel but I liked the culmination of the ending way better than Gone Girl  The Girl on the Train was a disturbing story but fascinating as well    Son zamanlarda pek fazla polisiye romani okumamistim  Trendeki kiz bu acigimi kapatti neyse ki  Kitap gercekten cok ovulmustu bende begenecegim on yargisiyla kitaba basladim  Ama ilk 150 200 sayfada biraz sikilmaya baslamistim  gorusum degismisti  Bunun aksine son 100 sayfayi bir cirpida bitirdim  yani kitabin ana yeri son 100 sayfa diyebilirim   Yazar ilk once bende sunu uyandirdi  Kitapta 3 farkli karakter ve bu karakterlerin anlattigi 3 farkli bolumler var  Bu bolumlerin anlatilmasi oyle ayrintili olmustu ki  bir karakterden baska karaktere gecince sanki karsimdaki insanlari degisiyormus gibi hissettim ve bu gercekten hosuma gitti  Benim icin kitabin arti yonu buydu   Romandaki karakterlerin hicbirinden hoslanmamam benim icin eksi yonuydu  Mesela bir kitap okudugumda  aa su x karakter ayni bana benziyor  gibi kucuk hislere sahip olurdum  Ama trendeki kizda Rachel  Anna  Megan hicbirini de sevmedim   Sonu boyle carpici olmasaydi siradan bir polisiye diyecektim  Ancak sonunu begendigimden siradanin biraz ustunde diyebilirim   Sanirim polisiye olarak sadece Agatha Christie okumaliyim    Bu sicak gunlerde icinizi kitapla serinletmeniz dilegiyle    Okay so  takes sip of tea  let s get this train wreck of a review started  duh  the pun was intended This book  at the beginning  started slow and  to be honest  I expected it to be more fast paced  But  when it does pick up  it s crazy  All the characters are messed up  twisted  and broken  I can t relate to any of them  which I kinda hope for in books  but I still enjoyed it  These characters were all very flawed and hard to attach to but I found the development as a whole great  We see these characters progress from what we first thought of them to be  or how they were described as at first  into something surprising even  This book  after a good 200 pages  had me really going on about what I thought was to happen to these characters  It was a thrill but the alcohol  sexuality  and overall damage of characters was something I hadn t mentally prepared for  I did bond with the characters  and by characters I mean Rachel  and sympathized with them  shedding tears  I overall find it very well written  If anything  I wish it would ve excited me a bit more at the beginning but the ending and turn out of everything satisfied me  So  yeah  if you re looking for a good mystery and thriller  you should give this one a try  While I wouldn t say this book rocked my world   it is well written and in many ways   disturbingly so   You will have to read to know what I am talking about   I enjoyed this book  It felt very  Hitchcockian  in premise and definitely held my intrigue for a great deal of the story  I would probably give the first three quarters of this book a 5 star rating because it definitely kept me wondering what the twist was going to be  However  as I tend to find in most of these type of mystery novels  the final outcome is never as great as the build up  Seldom is there ever a  wow  there is no way I ever saw that coming  moment  When there is    those books deserve a 5 star rating  Because  let s face it    there are only so many ways you can go with these things and so the overlap from one book to the next becomes a bit of a  been there  done that  cliche  But in this case  although the unfolded plot didn t knock me off my chair    I think it was an acceptable closure I do feel this book deserves a decent star rating for a couple of reasons  First  is that it does present a very intriguing plot that I never lost interest in  And it s presented in a steady but consistent pace    never lagging    but also not force feeding the story  Ironically   a bit like the pace of a moving train  Quick enough to constantly keep the reader turning pages    but still methodic enough to allow for a comfortable read Secondly I would give credit for the choice of narratives  I am a fan of split or multi person narration that allows the reader to take in the storyline from several viewpoints  I enjoy the way this type of narration reads because it always gives me a bit of feeling of a fresh start when I reach the next chapter so it never stagnates    if handled correctly  In this case  the juxtaposition of first person narrators not only gives a new viewpoint each chapter    but also helps add to the mystery at hand  A definite decent first novel for this author   I really liked this one  There were some minor issues  but overall I think it s worth the hype it gets  Rachel looks out her train window one day and witnesses something shocking that leads to a criminal investigation  Like a moth to a flame  or  more aptly  eyes drawn to a train wreck  Rachel takes rubbernecking to a whole other level  taking it upon herself to get involved and solve the mystery  I should mention that Rachel tends to get violently drunk  frequently experiences blackouts  and once lived right by that exact train stop  A foggy memory isn t exactly the best thing to have when you may  or may not  have been involved somehow   Paula Hawkins  writing and characterization reminds me of Herman Koch because they both create such despicable characters and when you re reading the book  you feel violently disgusted and embarrassed for these supposed  protagonists   Everyone is an absolute hot mess and psycho and the situation they ve gotten into is quite the cluster  You eventually realize that you re the girl on the train  observing the chaos down below and unable to tear your eyes away because  well  schadenfreude  Un thriller scritto benissimo  non sono riuscita a metterlo giu se non per poche ore e l ho divorato in una sola giornata    Il colpevole  Non l avevo assolutamente capito  mi ha lasciata spiazzata la crudezza delle immagini rese dalla scrittura della Hawkins  Consigliatissimo a tutte le persone che desiderano rimanere incollate ad un libro in maniera travolgente   The Girl on the Train Parts of this book hit a little too close to home  which made it difficult to get through without panic attacks of my own  but I m very glad I did    Sometimes I didn t know whether to feel sorry for Rachel  unable to conceive the child she so desired  she became depressed  losing her home  her husband  and eventually her job in the process   But she was also a pathological liar  lying to herself  to her landlord and friend  her mother  the police  and to entwine herself with the man whose wife disappeared  There s not too much more I can write about this book without giving away the plot twists    I did thoroughly enjoy the story  4 5 stars Lista para el HO  Gostei deste livro  prendeu me ate a ultima pagina  Mas pecou pelo facto da autora ter fornecido pistas demasiado generosas e cedo demais que  de certa forma  retiraram algum do impacto da conclusao   The holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mould yourself through the gaps  Wow  simply  wow  I had no idea what this book was but it was everywhere  The news  social media  friends were talking about it and I had read an article that it sold more books than Harry Potter did  The hype surrounding this book is almost as insane as the book itself and let me tell you  I sure as hell enjoyed this  It s already being made into a movie  People are claiming that it s the best book of 2015 and I agree with them This is compared to Gone Girl in many ways and I understand how it is  Everything this book did  Gone Girl did better and did first  However  there is no need to compare the two  This is more chilling than Gone Girl and more faster paced  It is a thrilling and heart pounding  well written  addictive novel that I highly recommend  Similar to the story telling of Gone Girl  this is narrated by three different females who take turns sharing their stories  It s a short read  shorter than Gone Girl  and I devoured this in a week  The last few pages  I stayed up and finished it in one sitting  I felt chills by the ending  It s a must read  It s narrated by a depressing alcoholic  an unlikable liar and a cheating unlikable girl who we thought was perfect  There names  Rachel  Megan and Anna Rachel takes the train everyday  she likes to cruise around London and she always looks out the window  She sees these couple on the porch who she sees  as perfect  She even named them as Jess and Jason  She created stories about them and watched them everyday  She saw them as the opposite of her tragic past  To escape reality  she imagines the lives of people she doesn t know  Then it happened Rachel saw Jess  real name  Megan  kissing another man which broke her heart  She was upset  drank her way out of the situation  But no    It wasn t just done yet  It was only the start Megan had gone missing  Megan is missing  Anybody seen the movie   a day after she saw her kissing somebody else that wasn t Jason  She is now part of their lives  unsure of what to do and she doesn t stop there I m going to try not to spoil it all for you and hopefully I don t  This novel is utterly insane and addicting  The characters were messed up and depressing  it was overall  an entertaining and fun read That ending ruined me and my heart was pounding as fast as going down on a giant Roller Coaster It s a must read Filled with unexpected secrets  twist of plot and mysteries that we do not see hinted before  It s horrifying and creepy  it s insane and addicting  you won t be able to put it down Plot  8 10Characters  6 10Style  8 10Overall  8 10 Disturbing and suspenseful  I really enjoyed it   it was perfect for this time of year  when I love reading creepy thrillers  This one kept you guessing until the very end I loved how unique the story was  And that it was written with several points of view  as well as having flashbacks to before the crime happened  My mind was in overdrive trying to piece things together and figure out how it all connected  The author does a really wonderful job of making you question everyone and everything Great debut from this author and I definitely recommend  I m sorry for such a vague and short review  but books like this are better read without any spoilers  8 5 de 10 Antes de falar da historia  gostaria de falar desta edicao que tenho nas maos  A TopSeller e uma editora relativamente recente mas esta a ser uma lufada de ar fresco no mercado literario nacional  com iniciativas que fazem as delicias dos amantes de livros E disso e claro exemplo este Exemplar de Avanco  onde os bloggers e outros comentadores literarios  para alem de poderem ler e dar a sua opiniao em primeira mao  tem ainda um exemplar diferenciado  Adorei a ideia e adoro ter este livro na minha estante A TopSeller  o meu agradecimento e faco votos que nos continuem a surpreender Comentario completo em http   abibliotecadajoao blogspot pt     There is no other way to put it    this is a very good book  a great read  but not a serious book The plot rolls along quickly  like an express train  not the stop and go commuter line that Rachel  the main character  travels on each day  Three people express their differing perspectives  Rachel of course  Anna who is the new wife of Rachel s ex husband  and Megan who is the idealized perfectly happy woman that Rachel often sees from her train window as she sadly drinks her gin and tonic while she commutes back to her lonely single room  The reader thinks perhaps this is to be a probing exploration of different women s lives  and the angst that can afflict them all  But then suddenly a shocking event takes place and we are into a murder mystery  And Paula Hawkins handles this very well    a compulsive detective story  with complex motives for possible perpetrators  and a timeline that adds to the complications  Once into this part of the book  readers will rocket along  anxious to follow Hawkins in the twists and turns she skillfully builds I enjoyed the ebb and flow of this book  the mystery which Hawkins underlines with her three person varying perspective  Nice work  I want to say at the end    you kept us with you and yet surprised us with your ending  But somewhere  somehow  I can t help feeling  Paula Hawkins lost her focus on the desperation that is there in Rachel at the beginning  and maybe Anna and Megan too  There is a story in this story of the hard dilemmas that modern women actually face  And in the end Hawkins does not pursue that story    that s what a more serious book would somehow have handled Rachel is badly hurt by her inability to conceive a child and her drinking addictions  Anna has the child with Rachel s ex husband that Rachel couldn t  but is having doubts about a homebound life  and Megan  it turns out  is not the perfect half of a couple  but someone with serious questions about commitment  These realities turn out to be crucial in solving the murder mystery    but I m left asking  and then what happens  about the larger social questions that this plot is built on   4 5 starsI don t even know where to start with this one  I had been SO SO excited to read this book  It took forever for me to finally get it from my library  and I immediately dove right in  I seriously can t believe that this is Paula Hawkins  debut novel  That s insane  So many people have been RAVING about it lately  and I m a huge thriller person  so I couldn t wait to get started on this book    There s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home    I almost feel like I can t even really write a review for The Girl on the Train  It s something that you really have to experience for yourself  It s very much in the same vein as Gone Girl in that the main character can be an unreliable narrator at times  and you never really know who s telling the truth or what to believe  And I love those kinds of books  Unreliable narrators are one of my absolute favorite kinds of characters  And that was something that Hawkins did very  very well and was probably the thing I liked most about this book  Another thing that was great about The Girl on the Train was the writing style and the prose  Beautiful  Just perfect  I loved it so  so much  In fact  it totally sucked me in  I can t even explain how sucked in I was by this book  From the very first page  I was like   Yup  it s going to be one of those   I had to practically yank it from my own hands in order to make myself put it down  and I was constantly thinking about it even when I wasn t actively reading it I also liked the fact that there were multiple narrators  I feel like that aspect of the book was  again  handled very well by Hawkins  A lot of the time when a book has more than one narrator  especially if there s more than two  I will have trouble fully connecting with the characters because I feel like I m not getting enough individual time spent with each one    and that s usually only multiplied when it s a relatively short book like this one  But unlike what usually happens  I felt super connected to each character in this book  I couldn t necessarily relate with them all  and you re really not supposed to  because some of them are quite awful  But I still felt like I knew and had an attachment to all of them I don t want to say anything about the plot  really  because it s hard to talk about without spoiling  You should really go into this book not knowing too much about it  But I will say that  for most of The Girl on the Train  I found the plot very exciting and constantly evolving  It was a very tangled web that became more and more unraveled as the pages turned  Eventually  though  I got to the point where it was obvious to me who was the  bad guy   And so then I had to wait for a few more threads to be unknotted while I waiting for the climax to finally come around  That part was my least favorite part of the book  because I feel like Hawkins did such a great job creating this incredible suspense and buildup around the final reveal that it was just slightly disappointing that her hints became a little too clear towards the end  before characters actually came out and said who they had realized it was  But  to be fair to the book  it really wasn t that much prior  I was in the dark for most of the book  although I had many theories    so I only had to sit around with my untimely knowledge for a few chapters before everything was put out in the open  Speaking of the reveal  one part of the book that I thought Hawkins did a particularly good job on was the climax itself and then what happened directly after the climax  I feel like  sometimes  thrillers peak at the moment of the reveal  then slowly just kind of end without much finesse  The part you ve been waiting for all this time has finally arrived  so whatever comes afterwards is more like an afterthought and not really that important  But Hawkins made me care about the afterwards  And I really  really appreciated that decision on her part  After the initial climax  the scene continues for quite some time and is really suspenseful regardless of whether or not you figured out the  bad guy  previously  It was a tense situation that had me completely on the edge of my seat and I LOVED IT  It made the plot really linger for me and not fizzle out as quickly as it usually does  Hawkins deserves major props for that Well  I guess I did end up kind of reviewing it  haha  I thought that I wouldn t be able to come up with thoughtful things to say  because it s such a popular book that so many people have reviewed  and just thinking about writing down my opinions was pretty daunting  But The Girl on the Train deserves a real review from me  so I just had to share what I was thinking  If you haven t already read this book   seriously  what s wrong with you  Get on the Train train   It s an exceptional thriller that will be intriguing to almost any reader   Well written  different perspectives keep the reader wondering just what will happen next  Not entirely unpredictable  but throughout most of the book  reader is kept in suspense  so it didn t have the answers written all over it  All in all  a good read  There s a whole lot of crazy crammed into this story and I rather enjoyed it  I did figure out somewhat early what must have been the thing that the three women had in common and I enjoyed reading along to find out that I was correct  I found the reveal  confession   resolution rather quick  it s literally a few pages  but I ve read other books where this happens so I think it must be that the journey was really the point and the Who and Why is not the raison d etre  I found it most difficult to abide with Rache but she s the first unreliable narrator I ve enjoyed reading in a very long while  This close look in with an alcoholic was suffocating  uncomfortable  pitiable and infuriating all at the same time  Ultimately  I think she was well written because I felt a lot for and toward her as I read  I even hoped for her to succeed at something  anything  for herself in the end  Meghan  while she had her own box of issues was a bit less real to me or more correctly  she was remote  I don t know if that was by design or just my interpretation while reading about her point of view  Though told in her voice  I felt that I never knew who she was  I was reading about her but I never felt like she was quite there  Given how things unfold in the story  perhaps that s the point  Anna seemed a clear character and while I didn t like her either  I saw where she was coming from and took some satisfaction in the truths that rained down on her about the life she cattily constructed and had thought she was immune from  The men in the story  Scott  Tom and Kamal were fine as characters but never felt as well crafted as the women and given that they are the hinges on which most of the angst is hung  I found that a shame  Still  their actions did come together neatly and I thought they were woven in well I know this is oft compared to Gone Girl  which I ve not read  so I don t know if it s a must read for fans of that book  but I do think it s a great and fast read for fans of mysteries and psychological thrillers  If you like intimate looks at the not so pretty sides of people  give this one a read  There are two things that everyone says about this book 1   OMG IT S THE NEXT GONE GIRL  2   The narrators are all horrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrible   I feel like any popular thriller with a big plot twisty reveal is going to earn comparisons with Gone Girl  I didn t find this as enjoyable or compelling as Gone Girl  mostly because I figured out who the villain was part way through  And I didn t find the narrators especially horrible  which either makes me a horrible person or is because I m also currently reading The Catcher in the Rye  and ANY character seems pleasant compared to Holden Caulfield  Sure  they all make terrible decisions  But they also all felt trapped by their circumstances and couldn t see a way out  It s a fast paced story  and I read it cover to cover in less than a day  It loses a star for occasionally feeling like a rinse and repeat story because OH LOOK RACHEL S DRUNK AGAIN AND NOW SHE S TAKING THE TRAIN  But on the whole  it was a compelling book with a pretty damned great ending   This one has you to almost the end  but i figured it out   suspenseful  but not  scary  suspenseful  Be prepared to jump characters and timeline a lot  24 hour read if you have the time  Every book in this genre wants to be the next Gone Girl  This isn t it  but it is a well paced thriller with some plot holes  but nothing that takes away the enjoyment of it  Rachel is sympathetic and pathetic  All the male characters are either evil or smarmy  Just as it should be in this type of book  I liked the suspense  even though the characters were extremes  It was still a fun read that went by quickly  Que puedo decir odie a las tres mujeres a Rachel por ebria  a Anna por paranoica y mensa y a Megan por ser una cabrona ansiosa sin remedio aunque el premio al desprecio es al grandisimo hijo de puta de Tom    pensar que existen humanos asi  sin embargo una parte de mi compadece a Rachel  los estrago de una traicion asi son muy jodidos Asi que me gusto por la atmosfera de ansiedad miedo que dejaba en mi en cada capitulo xD It was somehow boring and slow  especially at the beginning  BUT THE ENDING WAS MINDBLOWING  The Girl on the Train is a psychological thriller  and resembles a little bit of We Were Liars by E  Lockhart  The beginning was quite misleading  however  as the story continuously progresses through and through  pieces of the story s jigsaw puzzle fit well together to formulate quite a surprising plotline in the end Just so you know  This is an  Adult novel  but it reads like a YA  I m 100  sure that Young Adult readers  like myself  would quite enjoy this book somehow Review to come at the blog  Paula Hawkins highly anticipated debut novel keeps you on the edge of your seat until the climatic ending  The writing style of the novel is fantastic  switching character perspectives in order to remain fresh and giving layers of depth to the plot  My only complaint with this novel is the gaps in the middle of the story where there is no build up   or   relevance i guess  It s kind of like the main character  and other characters  go off on a tangent whilst revealing their backstory which can be slightly boring  but all in all it was an amazing book  I definitely did not see the ending coming and the action packed climax was definitely worth the wait Don t read this novel if you are too young or  immature  to deal with it s many adult themes  including alcoholism  violence  domestic abuse and the sexual content involved  The book does not dwell on sex scenes however the concept of sex plays a pivotal role in the story  It would be difficult to actually convey why I found this creepy  disturbing thriller to be so entertaining so I m not going to try  I would even consider re reading this in the future just to see how I felt knowing how it would end  Very impressive novel for a first time author   I stayed up way past my bedtime to finish this last night  My reaction at the end of almost every chapter was  OMG   WTF     I don t want to give away anything about the story  So  I ll leave it as this   if you like thrillers   mysteries with twists and turns at every stop  pick this book up  I m glad I did  The Girl on the Train has garnered a lot of attention  opinions are divided but go into this one with as little foreshadowing as possible and just let the disturbing twisty ness suck you in     you ll appreciate the normality of your own life  These characters are messed up  all of them  seriously messed up  It s an interesting character study that had me impressed with the authors skill  it s not an easy feat to keep a reader reading with a cast of unlikable characters  That said  as the story progressed I felt a begrudging sympathy for one of the most manipulated characters  The writing is strong and the narrators are great  they add that bit extra to the reading experience  I m glad I picked this one up on audio  And the ending     I actually laughed  not sure that was the desired effect  HA  What can I say     I like to see someone get their  just desserts     Ending could ve been a little more dramatic but overall really good I found it more of a psychological thriller than a simple who done it  I think the relatively few who gave it a low rating may just be jealous they didn t write it  First  this is a 4 5 star review  not 4 0 Wow  Am lovin  me some untrustworthy narrator  The story itself  though not action packed  is gripping  Each page brings new details of each character that makes the events spin  At some point during the story  I suspected every single character of committing the crime  don t worry  no spoilers here   I loved the British ness of the story  It s Gone Girl in London  Yes  leaves you with the same sense of marriage is a doomed institution  The only reason I didn t give it a full 5 star rating is I felt the ending left me slightly unsatisfied  The main character  Rachel  could have used a stronger growth arc But otherwise  well done Ms  Hawkins   I absolutely loved this book  definately in my top five of this year  Highly recommend to psychological thriller lovers  Great Book   We ve all had moments when we dream fantasy lives for neighbors or people we see by random encounters  However  as normal people we don t become obsessed  In Paula Hawkins debut psychological thriller  The Girl on the Train  the characters sway far from ordinary  The story is conveyed by three narrators  all women with extraordinary characteristics  The lead narrator  Rachel Watson is an alcoholic with memory lapses so large the reader will struggle to know who she is  as Rachel cannot remember for herself and must rely on the accounts of others to piece her days back together   Megan Hipwell is a woman with so many secrets and past lives the reader is left wondering what has she yet to let us in on and will we ever know all of her secrets  And finally a sugary  manipulative woman  Anna Watson  who seems to be struggling to lead an ordinary life but her actions leave the reader wondering which side of Anna will ultimately win out in the end Rachel Watson s life has not turned out in the manner of which she had dreamed  far from it actually  Rachel had an opportunity for a storybook happy ending  a loving husband  a job  a home and plans for a family  How then  did everything go so wrong  If only she could remember  Rachel s daily commute to London takes her past the life that she lost to alcoholic blackouts  stopping at a signal just behind her old neighborhood where her world went awry  So painful is seeing her former home  now shared by her ex  husband  his new wife and their child  Rachel focuses instead on a couple living a few houses down  She gives life to the neighbors she might have had  fantasizing them into a perfect  beautiful and happy couple  even assigning them poetic names  Until one day Rachel spies a scene from the train that shatters the dream she has assigned the couple  Rachel learns the next morning  after one of her drunken stupors  that the fantasy woman  Meagan Hipwell  has been reported missing  As Rachel pieces together the events of the prior evening  she discovers that she was in fact in the neighborhood at the time the woman was last reported having been seen  Taking on the self proclaimed role of  Nancy Drew  she begins investigating the disappearance of Megan Hipwell  She must first  however  play sleuth to her own whereabouts and actions of the night in question Megan Hipwell is bored  She has reinvented herself so many times over that she no longer knows who she is and what she really wants  She should be happy  Megan has a doting husband and beautiful home  Why then does she seek situations that could rip her world apart and dream of running away  yet again Anna Watson has gotten everything she wanted  She was the mistress that won  She got the husband  the home and the beautiful baby  Now she wants the one nuisance in her life gone  the ex wife  Rachel Watson  No one knows what goes on behind closed doors and lives dreamed up while on passing trains rarely correlate with what is happening inside the mysterious abodes Narration from the story s orators are scrambled but well done  As the pieces of the story start to fall into place  the reader will turn page after page to learn more  The women in this novel are unreliable  calculating and flighty  and the men are unquestionably flawed  It is difficult to find anything in common with these characters or genuinely likable for that matter  The unlikelihood of them all being entwined however  is what will keep the reader chugging along   Overall  pretty strong and certainly enjoying to read  I wasn t thrilled by the ending however  Esta historia nos cuenta sobre Rachel una mujer que todos los dias toma el tren de las 8 04 con destino a Londres  En el recorrido  el tren siempre se frena en un semaforo en el que en ese momento Rachel observa por la ventanilla la casa numero 15 de la estacion Witney  En esa casa viven 2 personas las cuales Rachel les inventa sus nombres y una vida perfecta  la cual ella esta lejos de alcanzar  Pero esta no sabe cuanto van a formar parte de su vida estas personas junto con otros personajes y asi cambiarsela para siempre En opinion personal el libro hace que el lector se ponga en la piel de la protagonista  cuya personalidad esta muy bien lograda y definida  El final muy bien desarrollado  Debo aclarar que las primeras 150 paginas se me hicieron medio lentas y me aburria  pero despues hubo algo que me hizo no poder parar de leer  Lo recomiendo para aquellos que les gustan los thriller y policiales  When everything has fallen apart and an early AM gin and tonic is the only cure  Rachel rides the train as if with purpose and plays voyeur to her old street and the handsome couple she creates a handsome life for  As with all illusions  it s soon shattered and a chain of events is kicked into action that brings peril by the bucketload Alcoholic and unstable  Rachel is perhaps the most honest of the three protagonists we follow  Behind Anna s role as the pretty usurper lies fear and emptiness of a hollow victory  as for Megan   unknowing puppet in Rachel s commuting fantasy   there s a chilling darkness impossible for her to escape from Running underlying themes of addiction and destructive obsessive compulsion  these heavy  yet everyday issues are stated with a matter of factness   not accompanied by a fanfare  which of course  makes them oh so more chilling  Above all else  Hawkins delivers a casually sensitive portrayal of a woman struggling with alcoholism and a duel perception to her illness   Rachel as the woman with a demon on her back  and Anna  the victim of her outbursts Seamlessly stitching together three POVs  the plot s timeline is impeccable not only in its consistency  but its ability to deliver the drama and make The Girl on a Train impossible to put down  No superfluous filler included  it s a teasing kind of prose that naturally beckons you on and on I found the female characters well developed  but not quite to my taste on the self esteem front or their high dependency for male endorsement   horses for courses though  they fulfilled their roles well Finding the sweet spot of momentum for every scene  The Girl on the Train marries heart thumping high tension  terror and desperation with the slow dark  empty spots of Rachel s addiction and depression If you re a fan of suspense based thrillers that track crime through the lives of the victims and accused opposed to alongside the Fuzz       then you ll love it Convincing characters  an unstoppable plot and frighteningly addictive prose  it s a novel that s hard to say no to  If you liked Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn  and or you like to remain confused until you find out that characters in your book are not what you believe them to be  then this book is for you  What a hoot  I did not want to put it down as soon as I started it  But then it wouldn t have been prudent to be late to work so it did have to be put away on Thursday long enough for a 5 hour shift at the library  Billed as a psychological thriller  it isn t actually all that  thrilling  until right before the end  then it all comes together so fast  The girl on the train is Rachel  She rides the train every day into and home from London  She has many emotional problems and is an alcoholic  Having recently been fired from her job she continues her routine in an effort to prevent her roommate from finding out  In London every day she goes to the library  visits pubs  and walks  The daily train ride takes Rachel through her old neighborhood  At a stop Rachel has a few moments every day to be a voyeur for she can see into the back yard and through the windows of the house where she had lived in happier times  Her ex husband  Tom still lives in her old house but now with a new wife and a baby  In another house up the road from Tom s lives a nice looking and seemingly loving young couple whom Rachel calls Jess and Jason She dreams up a wonderful life for them in her imagination and very much enjoys looking for them every day to see what they are doing Rachel s depression and alcoholism are debilitating  She is very unhappy and still in love with her ex  She continues to contact Tom and his wife which is considered harassment  some of which she doesn t even remember  Then one day from the train Rachel sees the woman she calls Jess kissing another man  A few days later Jess  whose real name is Megan  is reported by her husband Scott as missing  Rachel tries to get involved in the case by notifying the police about what she has seen but she is an unreliable witness and not taken seriously by the police because of her reputation of harassment and public intoxication  When she contacts Scott things don t go well either  Many in this book are not who they appear to be and some have mysterious connections  Scott is a very possessive hot head and a bit violent  Megan had at one time been an nanny for Tom and his wife Anna  Anna had been the lover of Tom s while he was still married to Rachel  The mysterious man that Meg was kissing is her psychiatrist  There are dark secrets  lies  hidden motives  and confusion  I guarantee by the time you get to about page 244 the power better not go off unless you have candles or a book light because you will not be able to stop reading  Isn t the cover art clever  The scenery is blurred representing what things look like on a speeding train and the double lettering which is how print in a jostled book often looks when reading in a moving vehicle   I did not suspect a thing  The unreliable narrator and cause made me super tense  Much better than  Gone girl  Superb psychological thriller  The story is narrated by three female characters  It starts slowly but quickly builds up steam and suspense  The rising plot is effective  the climax is chilling  and the resolution is more than satisfying  The style used to propel the plot along is unique and riveting  Kudos to Ms  Hawkins on this her debut novel  PAY ATTENTION TO THE DATES  The time sequence is important  Quando eu soube que A Garota no Trem seria lancado esse mes no Brasil  nao pensei duas vezes  larguei minha organizada lista e comecei a leitura  Ele fora lancado em ingles no inicio do ano e rapidamente viralizou no mundo inteiro  Com altas expectativas  fui conferir o que tinha de tao fenomenal nessa historia Rachel  a garota no trem  faz todos os dias  no mesmo horario  o trajeto de Ashbury para Londres  Nesse percurso  quando o trem para em um sinal vermelho  Rachel olha as casas  em especial a de numero 15  La observa  imagina e romantiza a vida de um casal  ate que  certo dia  ve algo que a surpreende e a deixa atonita  Dias depois  descobre que Megan  que na sua cabeca se chamava Jess  esta desaparecida e resolve ir a policia contar o que sabe  Com isso  termina se metendo mais do que deveria nesse caso e na vida de gente que ela so via pela janela do trem Chamam de thriller psicologico  de livro de misterio  de suspense  Para mim  e um drama sem tirar nem por  Sim  tem um misterio  um quem e o culpado  um o que aconteceu  mas acima de tudo esta o drama de uma mulher sem forcas para se reerguer  que encontra na bebida algumas horas de  nao diria felicidade  mas esquecimento Rachel e uma personagem incrivel  muito bem construida  por mais fraca e digna de pena que seja  Confesso que todo aquele desleixo me deu agonia e vontade de lhe estapear para ver se acordava  se resolvia viver  Os demais personagens tambem sao muito bons e bem verossimeis  Alguns me deram raiva  outros me enganaram Em meio a tantas narrativas comuns  lineares e sem dinamismo  A Garota no Trem se destaca com um texto excelente e meio fragmentado  escrito em primeira pessoa  alternando o ponto de vista entre tres personagens  Comeca bem lento  mas logo me fez entrar naquele espiral meio alucinatorio  me deixou zonza  como se a personagem tagarelasse muita coisa ao mesmo tempo e eu precisasse ler aquelas linhas em velocidade alta ou como se eu estivesse tao embriagada quanto ela No inicio  como nao havia lido a sinopse  nao tinha ideia de qual era a da autora  que historia ela queria contar  fiquei completamente as cegas  Demora um pouco para  acontecer  algo e a partir dai e dificil largar o livro  A autora tinha margem para terminar a historia de diversas maneiras  todos podiam ser culpados  Suspeitei ate da minha sombra  E  no final  gostei bastante do caminho escolhido A autora foi alem do simples misterio  Fez nos vivenciar a dificil luta de uma alcoolatra  nos deu uma mostra da vida de uma mulher em depressao  de alguem que se anula e projeta sua felicidade na felicidade dos outros  de alguem sem perspectivas  que acha que a vida dos outros e maravilhosa  que ninguem tem problemas  que a grama do vizinho e sempre mais verde  E nos prova que nem tudo e o que parece Fiquei pensando bastante com quantas estrelas o avaliaria  Por um lado  merece as cinco com louvor  Por outro  e tao depressivo do comeco ao fim que tira um pouco o prazer da leitura  Mas  sem duvidas  e um livro sensacional e vale muito a pena www historiasdepapel com br4 5 de 5 There was a lot of hype chat about this book so I was really looking forward to reading it  There are three points of view in this story  Rachel  Megan and Anna  The story is mainly Rachel s story  However I thought it was well thought out to give us the other points of view  We also get told of their story in the past and present so dates are important  I thought this story was really well written  For a debut novel to get this much hype is brilliant  My rating  I would have given this a 3 star however the twist was very good and I couldn t have predicted now the last few chapters turned out so it gets a 4 star from me For me I felt the story was a tad slow  It didn t grab my attention and unlike other books I wasn t thinking about it when I wasn t reading it  Thats my personal opinion  Some of my Goodread friends read it   loved it  That s what makes the literary world so exciting  that we all have different views on books Having said that I m looking forward to reading more by this author   Great murder mystery with unreliable characters and a twist that really blindsided me  I listened to the audiobook and I loved one of the performances  Rachel   liked another one  Ana   but didn t care for the actress reading Megan  we got it  she s depressed  you don t have to sound like you re half asleep    this is the only reason I don t give it 5 stars  Still  the story is intense and unexpected  I will shamelessly steal something I read on Audible  it s like rear window and gone girl mashed together  A solid mystery  The Girl on the Train is this year s Gone Girl  Because this thriller has taken the literary world by storm  I went into reading this novel without knowing anything about it  other than it was a New York Times bestseller  And I am glad that is all it took  because the twists threw me off guard throughout the novel  immediately hooking me into reading more  It compares to Gone Girl in some ways  but with more twists  and reads more like a soap opera special  There are so many problems going on with all the characters  that I lost count  Just take my word for it  and read one of this year s bestselling book  I love psychological thrillers and this is a very interesting one as it is clearly full with psychopaths  At one point I started to wonder who was going to kill who  I did figure things out halfway the book and that spoiled the fun a bit Rachel is the worst character    apparently an hysteric drunk it is not easy to connect to her  I pitied her though which I think was actually the feeling that was needed to feel doubt about her actions but hope that it might turn out well The two important men in this book Tom and Scott gave me an eerie feeling early on  The one a bit to much of a brute the other way to sly  I felt forced in being suspicious of both which I did not really like I loved the idea though of being so involved in people you see in your commute every day  Considering what their lives are like and making things up for them  The story did work and there was a great puzzle if you can stand trying to solve it trough the eyes of a gin evoked intoxication  If you like books that are written with multiple character s points of view  you will likely get sucked into this deliciously suspenseful novel about a depressed alcoholic ex wife named Rachel  the mistress turned new wife Anna and Jess Megan  a woman who both these women  know  who goes missing  Rachel is a pathetic and sad character  so desperate for happiness that she makes up a life for a couple she sees in her old neighbourhood when she passes their house on the train  To her  Jess and Jason are the perfect couple   until she sees Jess in a compromising position and learns Jess is Megan  a woman who went missing on the night Rachel was too drunk to remember  I loved how flawed all the characters are in this novel  and I thought the author did a good job keeping the reader guessing about who was responsible for Megan s disappearance  It s a short read as the author does a good job with keeping the plot moving forward and the writing style  story structure and voice given to the characters never ring false  A solid novel and a fun and light read   if you like slightly disturbing characters with poor judgement and a voyeuristic nature   What a book      Spolier Alert    I am so glad I finally read this  I had a completely different idea and I actually thought it was a YA book so I went into it clueless  I loved the main character  Rachel even though she was so weak and annoying sometimes but I felt bad for her and I started to really feel like I just wanna slap her in the face and wake her up  Like  Hey wake up    let go of Tom     Stop drinking  get a freaking life   And then the murder happens  I kept suspecting that maybe Rachel has killed Megan while she was drunk that night  I then suspected Scott when he locked Rachel in the room  Then the therapist slightly  Then Anna because Rachel saw her that night but NEVER Tom until the last few chapters and damn I feel slow lol  I hated Anna too with the way she hated Rachel and talked about her but I honestly I couldn t blame her  Rachel was a mess  The writing style was perfect  Simple enough and kept me going  I loved how the author included dates  This whole novel was a nice big surprise to me  I was so happy for Rachel s ending  Well the basic idea of the story is not new   One murder  a lot of suspects   some usual and some unusual and slowly the story reveals the culprit coming to the end   BUT what is different about this book is the style of writing   The book is written with the point of view of three main female character of the book  how they felt and did at those particular time frames or days The character of Rachel in the book is of a girl screwed by her own mind because of her drinking problems and so called memory issues  The story get you glued throughout as Rachel fight with her own mind while trying to find answers and her own relation to the Murder I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book though I predicted the killer midway through the book not trying to sound too intelligent here  It was just a random guess  and it turned out to be correct  Would definitely recommend to people looking for a gripping psychological thriller  easy read  Read it rather quickly  It was a page turner  After reading this and The Goldfinch  I would like to take a break from alcoholic characters   Rachel s life is a mess  Each day she rides the train into London and each day from the window as the train makes its stop  she sees THEM standing on their balcony  She calls them  Jess and Jason   She s fascinated by their seemingly beautiful life  She d give anything to be the beautiful Jess  And then one day  she sees Jess but not Jason  And then  there is no Jess Rachel is an alcoholic  She lies to her flatmate  She stalks her ex husband and his new wife who happen to live in the same neighborhood as  Jess and Jason   She s let herself go  Rachel can t stand herself  And you know what  You might not be able to stand her either  But yet  you ll want to read her story  You ll want to know her reasons   THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN  is told from three perspectives  We hear from Rachel  from Jess  whose real name is Megan   and  we hear from Anna  Rachel s ex husband s new wife  Three vastly different women who all have something in common  This debut novel is psychological thriller that has garnered comparisons to  GONE GIRL  and to  BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP   both books that I ve read and loved  If you re a fan of those books  you will find yourself lured into THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN as well  There is not one character in this book that you will fall in love with  Not one  But I promise you this  you ll remember each character and all of their sins  There are no innocents among the adults in this book  Yet I was compelled to just keep moving forward and reading more and more of the sordidness of the story  There s darkness to this novel  If you re looking for a book that will make you feel like you ve got your life completely together  this could very well be the book  Here s to never falling as deeply into the abyss as  Rachel   This one is a page turner  I was caught up in what will happen next and well  whodunit Rachel  the main narrator  is a mess  She knows she is a mess and at the start  isn t going to do much about that  She is an alcoholic who has lost everything  husband  home  job  She is living with a schoolmate from her college days  riding daily on the trains pretending to go to work and drinking  She imagines the lives of people she sees in their back gardens  Rachel drinks often to blackout  She wakes up not knowing exactly what she s done or where she s been  The feelings and failings she feels upon wakening seem very authentic  She is always going to do better tomorrow or later today  after she has a drink or two to make her feel better  The constant pull of drink is well done  I think  There are times I wanted to shake her and say don t do that  don t have a drink  And I think the frustration you feel is actually some of the frustration she feels with herself Megan  a second narrator  is one of the people Rachel observes  Megan has her own problem  secrets and mistakes  Her thoughts and experiences are really no more clear than Rachel s as exactly with whom she is interacting isn t always clear  That adds to the mystery The third narrator is Anna  Rachel s ex husband s new wife  Anna seems to be more straight forward  but maybe she is and maybe she isn t  There is her own reference to how much she has sacrificed for her marriage  but you never get to know exactly what that is and I kind of wanted that info  Does she think giving up her job that she didn t care about was a sacrifice  not getting dressed up daily is a sacrifice  or no longer having the excitement of being a mistress is a sacrifice  I d have liked to know There is a little backstory and introduction of everyone  but the story really kicks into gear when Megan disappears and the rest is finding out what happened to her  which would be easier if Rachel could remember what she  Rachel  was actually doing the night Megan vanished or if we knew all of Megan s story When all is revealed  you can see where the clues were  which I like  I ll have to admit that I did have the right guess on the perpetrator  but that s okay  It wasn t obvious and there are some red herrings as well The writing has an overall dark tone  even before what happens  It isn t a happy book and I think it works  Are there happy endings  You ll just have to read that for yourself  It is a very good thriller  I d definitely recommend and would likely read her next book  Fast paced and a bit frenetic  in the style of Gone Girl but not nearly as captivating  The plot had some holes and predictable angles but overall a good read   The idea of what Rachel sees from the train  and how she interprets what she sees  and the fact that she becomes entangled into a mystery of a missing girl  and doesn t remember things clearly because of her alcohol intoxication  was all interesting  The themes of infertility  divorce  suspicion  jealousy are well portrayed  Dialogue is naturally written  I wish the missing girl had been more likable  so the reader could feel more emotion Unfortunately  the story was overall predictable  though there were moments of suspense interspersed throughout  The ending scene was melodramatic and a bit disappointing   definitely an interesting idea   i think  i  too  would make up stories of people if i rode the train everyday   Here s my blog  https   rebbiereads wordpress com 3 1 2 lovely stars Hollowness  that I understand  I m starting to believe that there isn t anything you can do to fix it  That s what I ve taken from the therapy sessions  the holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mold yourself through the gaps     Paula Hawkins  The Girl on the Train Yikes  Talk about depressing  That was the undercurrent of the main character  Rachel  Call her a drunk  call her an obsessive creep  call her whatever you want and it will probably fit her to a T  Hawkins made her a transparent woman who drowned away her sorrows and neuroses in wine  and plenty of it  And oy vey  are there plenty of sorrows  She s still madly in love with her ex husband  verging on the cusp of being a stalker toward him  his mistress turned new wife  and of course  one creepy scene involving their new baby  Oh  and speaking of new wife  I don t care how Paula Hawkins tries to spin her  I just won t like her no matter what  I can t be besties with a character that is completely arrogant about her disgusting and inappropriate behavior  Yeah  maybe I sound like a puritan that belongs in the 1800s  but so be it  I wish we could trust people more  especially women  but unfortunately a few bad apples spoil the whole bunch  Here s a short excerpt of her nasty ass   I miss being a mistress  I enjoyed it  I loved it  in fact  I never felt guilty  I pretended I did  I had to  with my married girlfriends  the ones who live in terror of the pert au pair or the pretty  funny girl in the office who can talk about football and spends half her life in the gym  I had to tell them that of course I felt terrible about it  of course I felt bad for his wife  I never meant for any of this to happen  we fell in love  what could we do  The truth is  I never felt bad for Rachel     She just wasn t real to me  and anyway  I was enjoying myself too much  Being the other woman is a huge turn on  there s no point denying it  you re the one he can t help but betray his wife for  even though he loves her  That s just how irresistible you are     Paula Hawkins  The Girl on the TrainMoving on This is a classic psych thriller  mystery whodunit that might keep you turning page after page just to get to the end  The only difference between this story and a lot of others is that most of the characters are generally unlikable  That s ok though  it just makes them more realistic in my opinion You ve probably read countless comparisons between The Girl on the Train and Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn  and all that s true  but    this book deserves to stand on its own two feet and be recognized for being the awesome and dark story that it is So go run out and buy it  borrow it  rent it  whatever  Just don t steal it cuz nobody likes a thief  Talk about being pushed in different directions    I would think this is it and then on the next page it would be something different  Good job of the writers to keep us on our toes   I liked this book  although I did think the beginning was a bit slow  But compared to all the bad reviews I read before starting it  I was definitely pleasantly surprised  This was a wonderful book to have on hand to read while we had two new furnaces installed this week  It had just the right amount of thriller tension to keep me fixated on reading rather than listening to the pounding of the workmen in our basement  I kept thinking of  Gone Girl  as I read  This one had a similar feel and though I felt little or no sympathy for any of the characters  it was a compelling puzzle which I enjoyed trying to  solve   The perfect airplane or beach read  Love a good whodunnit   It was one of those binge reading books that even when tou re dead tired at night you can t help but to turn another page  For me it was a perfect mistery and I did not see that coming  A really good and intense thriller  You think you know someone well  Then it turns out that you don t  If in one word I am to sum up this book  it is this  unputdownable  The book shuttles back and forth between narratives of three young women whose lives become mysteriously entangled  All because of a sight seen on a train journey  The book builds up to its completely unexpected climax  which just goes to show  how much can you really trust a person  even yourself  Het verhaal zit als een perfecte puzzel in elkaar  Alle kleine details blijken achteraf van belang te zijn en het geheel valt uiteindelijk aan het eind perfect in elkaar  De lezer wordt meerdere keren in het verhaal op het verkeerde been gezet  waardoor je steeds weer voor een nieuwe verrassing komt te staan  Ik zou het erg knap vinden als je vanaf begin af aan zou weten hoe de vork in de steek zit  Het boek is erg goed geschreven en is erg gedetailleerd en spannend  Mijn hele recensie is hier te lezen  http   iheartbooks nl review het meis    A slow start   but once the mystery picked up I couldn t put it down  3 5 5 I did really enjoy the beginning and its premise  woman on train observes a couple over a considerable amount of time  enough to gives them names of  Jess  and  Jason   then sees something shocking  However  once the  mystery  was explained  I had a theory  and unfortunately I was bang on  That s why is 3 5 from me  I like being stumped  not having a clue how he she did what he she did  and the motive not being apparently obvious  in short  I like the  mystery  being complex enough not for me to be pretty sure of what of happened and why quite early on  Having said that  it is a quick easy read  definitely thrilling  a good holiday book I know many are comparing this to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn  personally I preferred Gone Girl  I was shocked in that book  I didn t know where it was going  and I actually liked the ending  I m aware many don t though   I loved it more because it was complex  there was also and added element of social commentary which I liked I will be looking out for more Paula Hawkins books in the future  because I do think this as a debut novel showed great potential   I m teetering between a 3 5 and 4 rating  You have three very unreliable and terribly awful characters narrating from their perspectives making it difficult to believe anything they say  After putting aside my distaste for EVERYONE in the book and the fact that there were many unbelievable aspects of the story  I was able to enjoy this thriller  The last half of the story was definitely the page turner that I was looking for   perceptions started to change and it kept you wondering and wanting to find out what the truth is  I found this book to be one that was hard to put down  but the end result didn t blow me away or make me feel shocked in awe  Yes  there was a twist  but for some reason it really didn t shock me  I liked how the author wrote an unreliable narrator  it made for a more interesting read overall  I did enjoy this book a lot  it just wasn t epic or mind blowing   Reading this book is like watching a trainwreck  The story kept me guessing but I started to feel as awful as Rachel after a night of drinking  One pet peeve of mine is when a Villain takes their sweet time to explain everything before the final climax  This one was just over the top   Written in almost diary format from the perspective of 3 women  Rachel has many issues and creates a fantasy world where she imagines other people s lives I did have to keep track of the dates as the story did jump about a bit  but it was an easy read that kept a good pace and held one s interest I guessed quite early on who may have been responsible  but such were the twists that I wasn t sure until the very end I didn t feel as much empathy with Rachel as perhaps I felt I should  she wasn t very likeable  although believable Anna surprised me very much  she was capable of protecting her husband despite finding out about the affair and what he had done  she didn t call the police after he attached Rachel  but then she made sure he couldn t come back  I found this book to be an intriguing read with enough mystery to keep me coming back  If you re looking for something to cheer you up  don t read this  But if you like something with mystery   suspense  then you will probably enjoy this  Read this one on the long car ride home and it was a page turner towards the end  Good read  reminded me a little of gone girl Interesting read  lost my attention at the climax Mi resena de la novela  http   contandoteunlibro blogspot com    Better review upcoming but first thoughts upon finishing  terrific read until the last fifty pages when it fell apart  The  reveal  feels like a betrayal of the really strong characters set up earlier in the book  Anna s chapters do little to merit their inclusion  I understand the appeal of having the three main women have their respective narration but Anna s chapters can basically be summarized thusly   I love Tom  Tom is so good  Baby baby baby baby baby have I mentioned I m a mother baby baby  I hate Rachel  she s fat   Also  the killer is almost Vaudevillian once the reveal happens So it s really a shame that what was a good read for 250 pages went so tits up  because it had a lot of good things going for it up until then  Sympathetic main who makes enough mistakes so you root for her and sometimes hate her but tries so hard that you really want her to succeed  deeply engaging character driven storytelling  and starkness and cynical humor creating a winning tone  Could so easily have won the five if it could have wrapped itself up well  It s 4 AM and I have no idea how the hell I m going to sleep now  This was one hell of a ride Kurgu 10 numara   anlatim 10 numara   bu kitap cogu yonuyle 10 numara  Ben bizim cok entel halkimizin       kitabi nasil okudularsa artik   yaptiklari olumsuz elestirileri gorunce kitabi okumamayi bile dusunmustum  En iyi yorumcu en iyi okuyucu kendinizsiniz arkadaslar    Obviously I enjoyed the story or else I wouldn t have rated it a 4 out of 5  The reason I didn t rate it a 5 is simply that it took a long time before I felt engaged with the characters  I realize that the vogue is to tell the story from several characters  points of view but in this case I felt that splitting the readers  attention between three apparently disconnected personalities for the first 30  of the story was just too long  A nit perhaps  but I assume that s why you read these things  One of my favourite things to do in life is people watch  I love sneaking covert glances at complete strangers and wondering what their lives are made up of  More often than not  this happens on public transport  so this book has struck a chord Rachel is going through an incredibly difficult time  On her way to and from work each day  her train stops behind a row of houses  She looks in the garden of a particular one and sees a couple she believes to be the epitome of happiness  Constructing a life for them in her head  seeing them each day helps her cope with her failed marriage  her loneliness  and her turbulent alcoholism  One day she sees something that doesn t quite fit into the fantasy  and things spiral out of control as she becomes involved in a police investigation  We soon find Rachel is more closely connected to the couple than we think  however to give anything else away here would be entirely unfair to future readers Every character in this novel was overly loathsome in their own way  Hawkins really explores the darkness of the human character by using multiple voice with three narrators as unreliable as each other  Although it doesn t take a Holmes intellect to solve the mystery  getting there is the real pleasure  Hawkins writing style is unsettling  we can t trust any of the characters  and we have no idea where we re going  Rachel s alcoholic blackouts make us distrust her  but her sorrow and regret strike up rhythms of sympathyThe most terrifying thing about the story is the implication that you never truly know a person  We all know people lie  people hide things  but to what degree  It s disturbing to think that those closest to you could have secrets that could question your whole perception of them It s a pretty standard mystery crime thriller suspense novel  and although I can understand why some dislike it  I found it gripping and fascinating  Despite the twist being predictable  and the plot starting and stopping as much as the symbolic train  I enjoyed it as a study of character  of flaw  and of the illusion of trust   Life is not a paragraph  and death is no parenthesis Review to come  I still need to wrap my head around what I just read                                  FINALLY got a copy of this   My hold got deleted by accident and apparently I would have been hold  259 out of 16 copies    ya fuck that  So the nice lady at the library called me saying they just bought a copy for their kindle that people can check out  It s in kindle form on the first generation kindle but who cares   I finally get to read this bitch     Enjoyed this one even though I had the twist figured out rather early on  But well written  The word  quieten  makes me itchy though     This is another one of those times where I vacillate between 3 and 4 stars  It gets 4 for the page turning factor and the psychological suspense  It gets 3 because I read it too late in the game and listened to too much over hype  and the characters wore me out after a bit  I agree with Kelly that is seemed a bit confusing in the beginning  and with  Mum  that the comparisons to Gone Girl knock it down a notch All in all it was a fast and worthy read  3 75 stars  http   gokhantezcan blogspot com 2016   Kitap hakkinda tek bildigim  kayip kiz  ile kiyaslanmasiydi Gone girl u okumamis sadece filmini izlemis biri olarak ben hic benzetmedim yada kiyaslamadim Kiyaslayacak olsam gone girl 5 puanlik bir kitap bu degil Bazi kitaplara baslayinca bir 50 60 sayfa okumaniz gerekir icine girmek icin Trendeki kizda bu olmadi direk ilk sayfadan isindim kitaba Rachel in yerine koydum kendimi empati yapmalar falan Ama bir sure sonra rachelin umugunu sikasim geldi Bu kadar aciz bu kadar aptal asik olamaz biri Onun disinda olay orgusu karakterler falan gayet guzel islenmisti Polisiyelerde is biraz tahmin etmeyede kalmistir ve ben tahmin ettim sayilir tam olmasada Zaten bir avuc karakter vardi ve parmakla gosterilenin katil olmayacagini polisiye okuyan herkes bilir Genel olarak guzel bir kitapti sikmadi cok sasirtmadi ama tatmin etti bekledigimi buldum  First off  this is not my usual read  I don t tend to pick up the  book du jour   as they almost never live up to the hype  Like GONE GIRL which I just could NOT get into and never read more than 50 pages  This one is the exception to that general rule  Ms  Hawkins is a very skilled writer because I hated every single character in this book  yet I still kept reading  I had difficulty finding any redeeming qualities in any of these people  The story was excellent  even if it was sometimes hard to follow  It s told from 3 different viewpoints at different times  so I found myself frequently turning back a few pages in order to remember who was speaking at any given time  I had a good feel for who the  bad guy  was  but that didn t take anything away from the story  If you don t normally pick up a  bestseller  you might break from habit and give this one a try  RECOMMEND  This story was difficult for me to get into at first  but since it was our book group book I was committed to finishing it  and I m glad I did  The reason I couldn t get into it initially was because I didn t care for the main character  She seemed weak and foolish and drank too much alcohol  But about a quarter into the book  when I realized why she was so weak  I felt sorry for her  which is always a draw for me  Then I had to know how the story ended I suspected who the real  bad  person was in the story quickly  but for a long time I thought two characters were the same person  The author didn t give them enough unique and separate characteristics  so they sounded the same I really loved how this story shows us that things are never as they appear  The girl on the train thinks she sees something  but life is way more complicated than what you see at first glance  This story was a great reminder of that If you have trouble with intense thrillers  you might have to put this book down toward the end to take breathing breaks I only gave it a 4 star because it s not my kind of book  It s too dark  The rating has nothing to do with the quality of the writing  The writing was great  Spooky and suspenseful  I couldn t put it down until I reached the end   There s a certain irresistible urge to invent details about the lives of the strangers we see  Sometimes it s just a way to pass the time  but for Rachel Watson  it becomes an obsession that puts her in the middle of both a personal crisis and a crime investigation  Rachel is Hawkins   girl on the train   who  during her commutes to London and back  notices Scott and Megan Hipwell  an attractive couple she believes is gloriously happy  Rachel gives them imaginary names and assigns them glamorous and exciting lives  filling a void in her own life  When Megan goes missing  Rachel is sure she can help  if she can only dig through her alcohol clouded memories of the night Megan disappeared I enjoyed this psychological thriller  which reminds me of the Alfred Hitchcock movie   Rear Window  and introduces the idea that a stranger may know more about a crime than the people involved  The story is narrated by three characters  Rachel  Megan and Anna Watson  new wife to Rachel s ex husband  Tom  The story s momentum is based on details that are withheld by each narrator  much like a  getting to know you  phase in real relationships  It isn t until the finish when the reader can look back and realize that  yes  this one was a jerk all along  or that one was suffering much more than it showed  this one actually showed some good qualities and that one did a good thing  A second read shows details  references and foreshadowing that may go unnoticed the first time around Readers have criticized this withholding of details  saying it s a contrived method to keep the story going  but I think it is very similar to the beginnings of real relationships  No one spills it all in the beginning  The big reveals often come much later Hawkins  female characters  although not overly developed  represent the challenges that young women face  careers  marriage and children  On the surface  these are universal choices  but for many  individual back stories and loss make it impossible to move forward  Rachel is so desperate for human contact she thrusts herself into a crisis  Megan is haunted by her own demons and behaves recklessly  And Anna has the dream life  but her possessive and territorial behavior may wreck what she has The male characters in the story are as much a puzzle  muddled with both good and bad parts to them  causing the reader to question all of their motives  Added to the mix is a mysterious man with the ginger hair and blue eyes  someone Rachel only has a dim memory of meeting As new facts emerge  the reader gets a clearer view of who s who and who did what  which  at this point  moves the story to its final and tense confrontation and a satisfying finish I disagree with other criticisms that the book s finish was predictable  I don t like to look too far ahead when I m reading a book like this because I think it takes away from its enjoyment  which is the whole point  isn t it The Girl on the Train is a suspenseful  fast and entertaining read  with deeper questions about relationships and human contact Thanks for visiting   come back soon  Unlike other readers who have read Gone Girl  I have not  it s in my  To Be Read  list   So maybe it s a good thing that I have nothing to compare against I read  The Girl On The Train  as it was chosen for my Book Club  for our discussion in June 2015   I was impressed that it was the author s debut novel  Being a psychological thriller  it was exciting enough to keep me on my toes  and want to continue reading from chapter to chapter  A serious crime took place and the book is all about uncovering the truth  all from the viewpoint and actions of Rachel Watson  the girl who saw something from the train The viewpoints from the characters given in alternating chapters helped to give an all rounded quality to the plot  It helps you understand the characters  and what makes them tick beneath their skin  The character development was also done slowly  and more pieces were revealed as you went deeper into the book  Like anything in life  you begin by knowing just a little  then more layers are peeled off until you see all facets of the person  until you begin to see their light and dark sides You can t help rooting for the characters as you read them  It s like the author has let you into their head   you hear their thoughts  you know about the things that disturb them  you feel with them and even smell or taste with them  I think this is what was most riveting in the book  That a person  on the outside  may look smiling and happy  but inside they may be crumbling or falling apart  You never actually know  do you Things begin to speed up as you approach the last few chapters of the novel  The ending would give you closure to the mystery  but not before you are taken on a roller coaster ride as you speed headlong into the bright  glaring spotlight of the big reveal of the perpretator  This book will certainly make a good movie one day  just like how Gone Girl has  I couldn t put it down I was sorry to see the book end  I generally don t read mysteries  but this book has made me view them in a different light  Got lucky and was able to borrow a friend s copy this weekend  Sat down shortly after Noon today and finished a bit after 8 with breaks take for food  laundry  fetching Martin from skiing and going online Twisted but I figured out the murderer fairly early  but kept doubting myself that it would use some of the twists from  Gone Girl or from  The Other Typist   Besides the mystery  I was quite taken with the look at alcoholism  family relationships  neighbors  and children  There are three narrators in this novel  all of them unreliable  They are unreliable for different reasons  though  The main one  Rachel  the girl referred to in the title  is unreliable because she s a drunk  Not just an alcoholic  a stumbledown  blacked  out  puke on the stairs drunk  She knows this about herself  and wants to change  but she can t  Not yet The quietest of the three is Anna  who is unreliable because she so firmly refuses to see what is in front of her eyes  She s married to Rachel s ex husband  the guy who finally had to leave her because her drinking was just too out of hand In the middle is Megan  who is unreliable because it suits the author to make her that way  Rachel and Anna s unreliability springs naturally from their characters and the situation they find themselves in  Megan lies simply by omission  by talking about mysterious men who are mysterious merely because she chooses not to share their names or any identifiable information with us  She obviously can t  because if she did  the mystery would be over before it ever got started  But it is a major weakness in what is otherwise a powerful thriller that deserves its status as this year s Gone Girl  I wish Hawkins had come up with another way of presenting Megan s side of the story The jist of the story is this  Rachel rides the train past Megan s house every day on her way to work  Megan lives just a few doors down from the house where Rachel s husband still lives with Anna  his new wife  so naturally Rachel pays careful attention to that particular row of houses  One day  she sees Megan with a man who is not her husband  and a few days later  Megan disappears  Rachel knows she was in the neighborhood the night Megan vanished  but that is all she knows because she was staggeringly drunk at the time  Did she witness something  Or worse   did she do something Rachel blunders from one stalker worthy mistake to another  fighting guilt and her own ineffectuality  alternating between days where she actually manages to remain sober  and days of which she has no memory whatsoever  She is pathetic but we can t help rooting for her because she is just self aware enough to know that this cannot go on the way it is I realized whodunit about three chapters before the murderer was revealed  but it didn t blunt the story s power because the killer is only part of the problem  The bigger and more human question is how things will end up for Rachel  I liked the imagery of the writing  I felt that some of the choices of the characters where a little far fetched but the same could probably said about some of my choices while young and foolish  All in all  it kept me reading and engaged  I really enjoyed this book  I don t know what it says about me that I get so sucked into books that consist of terrible characters   but I do  I guessed who the killer was pretty early on in the book  but that didn t really matter to me because it was still entertaining watching how the other characters figure it out  Overall  I recommend this book to everyone  I really did enjoy this book as I found myself listening  yep this one was an audiobook for me  to it every spare second I got  I saw this book compared to  Gone Girl   which is not exactly how it should be advertised  It is nothing like Gone Girl  no  crazy bitch  moment or  WTF  moments  just a great murder story  I actually had it figured out about page 200 it all started to come together  but the ending was great  A book I would tell people to  read  if they were interested  but not something I would go out of my way to tell people  YOU MUST read this   It seemed to go round and round at points  and it could have been shortened by taking out those moments  It also could have used A LOT more  Anna  POV to me  I didn t feel like I heard enough from her  Also  I was left wondering what ever happened to Scott after Rachel made her complaint to the police about him going cray cray on her ass  I would have liked to see that loose end tied up Good book  but not something that will stay with me until the end of time   Wow   I needed some time after finishing this book to sort my thoughts and feelings about this story  But even hours later I m still just blown away by this novel  The realness that this story portrays is phenomenal  The characters were well developed and this story gripped me from the very beginning  After finishing this story  it made me look at the world differently  I will never again look at someone and assume their lives are all rainbows and sunshine  This story took something we are all guilty of  thinking the grass is always greener somewhere else  and puts it into a context that genuinely makes you want to never make those assumptions again This book is for mystery  suspense lovers  This book just blew me away  so I say everyone should read it   4 1 2 stars  There s a reason this is such a popular book this year  it s a good old fashioned page turner  I actually read this earlier this year and I decided to listen to the audio for an upcoming bookclub meeting  I think I enjoyed it more the second time around because it gave me opportunity to study the characters a bit more  TGOTT is ostensibly a who done it suspense read  however  it s the characters that make it engaging  Especially Rachel  God bless Rachel  she just can t help herself  I love a good literary drunk  As much as heavy drinking is portrayed in fiction  most authors really don t capture it well  More often than not  characters drink to excess with little or no consequence  Maybe there is mention of a hangover  but rarely do characters drunk dial  break things  or hurt themselves  all common foibles associated with heavy drinking  For anyone who has dealt with alcohol abuse on one way or another  and who hasn t   you know there is constant struggle  constant regret  and constant rationalization happening  By the way  if you are fortunate enough to have not experienced this  I recommend Drinking  A Love Story So back to Rachel  Rachel is an alcoholic  and that plays a major role in the book  Even when she s not drinking  her addiction drives her  Some of her decisions and actions are embarrassingly painful to watch  Man oh man  did this author nail Rachel s struggle  On the surface  Rachel is seen as pathetic  washed up  and unstable  Rachel s drinking is fodder for the smugness found in the other characters  especially Anna  This is how everyone perceives Rachel  the quintessential unreliable narrator  But what is really important  for which I applaud the author  is that she does have good qualities and she isn t a lost cause  she is human  I m not going to go into the mystery or other characters other than to say that they are all pretty unlikable  which for this sort of book is a really good thing  An easy read and a page turner  For part of it  I was thinking it was a ripoff of  Gone Girl   because there was a missing wife  and the narrative was written in the first person by three characters jumping around in time  So  when I starting going down one line of thought  I had to reverse after reading the  flashback   This is Ms  Hawkins first book  I await her next   Hmm    A lot of readers will say  ugh  all of the characters were awful  what a terrible book   I disagree  Aside from the murderer  I found the people actually quite real  The private struggles in each marriage are things that happen to some  infertility  jealousy  alcoholism  adultery  emptiness  I liked Rachel  She s depressed  spiraling  and an alcoholic  At first I pitied her  but then as her story was revealed  I could understand what happened to her  If you ve ever had someone close to you that is alcoholic  I feel you could relate to her  Each time she says she will stop  she cannot remember anything  the pity  It is a horrible disease She becomes obsessed with a couple that lives on her old street  They happen to live a few doors down from her ex husband and his new wife and baby  She still hasn t come to terms with the ex leaving her  and moving his new woman in within 4 hours  She begins to fantasize that the neighbors are perfect  that she is the woman  and has the happiest life ever The author intertwines their lives in a riveting story  I could not put it down   Aside from the week I broke my kindle and had to order a new one  I had guessed the killer correctly  but not the motivation Great read Side note  I hated Anna the entire book  What a sniveling  whiney  selfish  mess  3 5 Very suspenseful and hard to put down  Wow  this was intense  I still have a mild headache from reading this book like a crazy person yesterday  I legit sat laid on my bed and read for  like  5 hours straight  I knew I needed a couple of breaks for snacks and water but I couldn t make myself stop reading  I needed to know what was going to happen next  and next  and after that  chapter after chapter I needed to know if Rachel was OK  and what the hell happened on That Saturday  Why was Rachel all roughed up  Who did that to her  What can t she remember  What happened to Megan  And why  Gods  the heroine  Rachel  is such a flawed damaged character  a real hot mess  constantly drunk  constantly calling and emailing her ex husband Tom  constantly showing up at their old house where he now lives with his new perfect wife and perfect baby girl  My goodness  I facepalmed so many times  RACHEL WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF  WHY   It was depressing and heartbreaking to see her in that state  day after day  Even more so when she lets the reader know how happy she used to be  how great her life was before her marriage started to fall apart  before she started to drink to forget and not feel anything  before her husband started to cheat on her  before the divorce  before the empty  lonely life she lives now And  grrrr  it s so damn frustrating because  really  no one wants to be around an alcoholic  particularly if you don t understand how or why they can t simply STOP  and I admit I was a little hard on Rachel myself  for a couple of chapters I kept screaming at my ereader  STOP DOING THAT  STOP DRINKING  STOP GETTING HURT  STOP SHOWING UP AT THEIR HOUSE  GO TO AN AA MEETING  GET YOUR LIFE TOGETHER  It s so easy to judge someone with a destructive addiction  but in this case  and as the story progressed  I got more and more invested in cheering for Rachel  because you can tell she s a good person  and even though she s a responsible adult  she didn t get to that point just by herself  there s a great amount of emotional and physical abuse behind it all and it really isn t fair how her life has been in total havoc for the past years  while other people pretend they have nothing to do with it  or worse  pretend that they are victims of this situation  that they re victims of this  quoting and paraphrasing  annoying  sad  pathetic  fat drunker who can t stop harassing her ex and his new family  and now she s even doing it to strangers  Jesus  this woman must be stopped  but I can t say much more because I don t want to spoil this book for anyone Other thing that struck me deep down was how this person whose life is in shambles  who knows that people look at her with utter contempt and disgust  and who s deeply ashamed by the train wreck that is her situation  still decides to get involved in the investigation of the disappearance of a stranger  Megan Hipwell  a woman she used to see through her window every day when she was on the train  Mostly she wants to help this woman s husband  who she believes is not to blame for this occurrence  and of course she wants to know what happened to Megan  the thing is  to help she has to come clean about her life  and  oh my God  it was painful to watch  Imagine trying so hard to help  trying your best  trying  and in return being treated like a repulsive  hardly worth of a minute of attention  drunk fool who s wasting everyone s time  I m telling you  AGONY  this woman can not catch a break  On top of wanting to see this mystery of the gone girl solved  and Rachel get her life back on track  I was dying to know what happened during all those alcohol blackouts  more so when it becames clear that one in particular holds the key to the big mystery  and also that someone took advantage of her confusion and repressed memories  so think  Rachel  think    I couldn t stop thinking about how terrifying it must be to not know what happened to you and around you  to have entire hours of your life erased from your memory  and then you wake up and you re bruised and bloodied  and no idea why  Terrifying   stops to look at review  Whoa  this is long  Okay  I m going to wrap it up now This book was a wild ride  utterly gripping and unputdownable  both because of the mystery surrounding Megan  and also because you want to see Rachel succeed  be safe  change her life  I highly recommend it   This is going to be a movie too    My review contains spoilers This was a promising read but fell flat in a couple of places and left one main question unanswered   Here s the spoiler     Who leaked the information about the big issue with Mac  It is a major event in the story  yet the search to find out who told the media is dropped without explanation  Leaving a loose end like that is a bit messy My other issue is the characterisation of the current wife   her persona is erratically depicted   she starts out as a kind of perfect mother and then becomes a vindictive she wolf  It must did t ring true for me That said  there is a lot going for this novel  The main character is wonderfully drawn and the plot moves along at a good pace  A great first novel with the best yet to come  This was one of those books that you have to remind yourself to stop for eating and sleeping  It was quite addicting  The mystery itself was very interesting and the pacing reveals pieces of information slowly so you re constantly wanting to read  one more chapter   The characters were complicated and not 100  good or bad  I enjoyed this fast paced tale of desperation and conflicted souls  Very reminiscent of Gone Girl and almost as equally compelling  I am never good at predicting outcomes of murder mysteries so I enjoyed following this one until the end  The story is not at all uplifting so would only recommend to those who are not at all faint of heart   I thought it started slow  But couldn t put it down  I figured it out early  but it was still great   This was really fast paced and unputdownable  However  the ending was a bit underwhelming  So much built up and then it just hit a plateau   Alrighty  so I ve just read another book with an extreme amount of hype surrounding it  The Girl on the Train has been compared to Gone Girl in almost every single review or article I ve seen about this book  Although I did see a lot of similarities between the two  I felt as though The Girl on the Train was a mixture of Gone Girl  another Gillian Flynn novel  Dark Places and Into the Darkest Corner by Elizabeth Haynes  The Girl on the Train is told from three different female character s perspectives  Rachel  Megan   Anna  The story opens up with Rachel riding a public train to and from work everyday where she has created a fictitious life for a couple living in a house close to the tracks  Things get a little complicated once Rachel witnesses something while looking out of the train window The comparisons to Gone Girl begin when a main character goes missing and the story becomes a search for the missing woman  Other similarities include the idea of her husband being responsible for her disappearance as well as characters that are not particularly likable  The comparisons I ve found in relation to Dark Places include the way the story was told in three different perspectives while also jumping timelines  Comparisons to Into The Darkest Corner by Elizabeth Haynes might be a tad bit spoiler ish so I m not going to go into it  but hopefully those who have read it understand where I m coming from Overall  this thriller was good and I thoroughly enjoyed it  Was it as shocking as I had hoped  Not really  Was it as dark as a Gillian Flynn novel  It had its moments  but I would say no  especially when compared to Dark Places   Sharp Objects  I think readers will enjoy this book more so if they do not compare it to Gone Girl   view spoiler   I will say though that this ending was a lot more satisfying than the ending to Gone Girl    hide spoiler   Book on CD narrated by Clare Corbett  Louise Brealey and India Fisher Rachel rides the same train each day from her flat in a suburb of London into the city for her job  and back again  As she passes one particular suburban neighborhood she becomes fixated on a couple she sees having breakfast on their deck  She gives them names   Jason and Jess   and invents perfectly happy lives for them  One day she sees the couple kissing     but it s not Jason  it s another man with Jess  A few days later Rachel reads a news report about a missing woman  the picture of Megan Hipwell is  Jess   What a wild ride   gripping and fascinating  The novel is told in alternating points of view  and moving back and forth in time  We have three distinct narrators  Rachel  Megan and Anna whose lives converge around the two men  Tom  Rachel s ex  and Anna s current husband   and Scot  Megan s husband   We learn early about Rachel s alcoholic fugues and black outs  her inability to remember  her warped thought processes  Clearly she is an unreliable narrator  But as we hear from Megan and Anna  and their secrets  we begin to doubt whether any of the characters can be trusted to tell the truth  I was guessing right up to the reveal  and the ending is nothing short of chilling  The audio is capably narrated by three voice artists  Clare Corbett  Louise Brealey and India Fisher  But I have no way of knowing who voices which character  Frankly  they sound very much alike to me and if Hawkins hadn t started each chapter with the narrating character s name  and the voice artists hadn t read those chapter titles  I think I would have been completely lost  Still the pace of the narration was good  I give this 4 stars  I liked the book  it sucked me in from the beginning and oddly enough I was able to relate with most of the female characters  However I was able to predict the ending  or the killer  it was still a great read a few parts I wish had been on expanded on but all in all I did enjoy this  it also looks like a fantastic audible book  almost wish I had listened rather than read this one  I would recommend both versions  The book definitely caught my attention and I wanted to finish it   this doesn t always happen with novels  I found the protagonist interesting and relatable  however the other two women in the story  Anna and Megan   I thought were more narcissistic and vapid  Even so  I loved the story itself  even if it is somewhat misogynistic at the end    3 5 stars Video review coming up soon  hopefully  I really enjoyed this book and felt empathy for Rachel and Anna  although none of the characters aren t particularly nice people  I liked the style of the book using different pov s but I would of liked to see the pov from Scott and Tom just to give it it an extra edge Finally caught up with this one after months  years   of hype  then read it in a single day while sick on the couch  This book is perfect for that  it s quick and suspenseful without being too complicated or deep  The characters are all messy and imperfect  which I appreciated  though the ending was a little too neat  Nothing life shattering  but a pleasant escape  Paula Hawkins uses a unique approach in her debut thriller  The main character  Rachel  has a troubled past and over active imagination  What she observes from her seat on the commuter train drives the action and plot in this thriller  This is a must read for lovers of the thriller genre   Tant de buzz autour de ce livre    et la volonte d apprecier ce que la lecture me reserverait  coute que coute  J ai donc zappe les avis qui circulaient deja en masse pour me consacrer sereinement a cette histoire qui est dans l air du temps  une narratrice peu fiable  une intrigue nebuleuse  le coup de theatre final  Toute la force du roman vient   selon moi   des trois intervenantes dans l histoire  dont les roles interchangeables viennent completement troubler notre perception de l intrigue  On ne cerne plus la plus credible ou la plus coupable des trois et c est assez perturbant  Cela compense aussi avec le peu d action dans notre affaire  qui tient la distance grace a une pression psychologique constante et finement jouee  J ai certes vu venir la fin  mais ai attendu jusqu au point final pour obtenir toutes les reponses  Qu on aime ou pas  cela reste une lecture redoutable sur un plan machiavelique  et efficace pour le climat lourd  suspicieux et tendu de bout en bout  I admit  it probably took me a little longer than it should have to figure this one out  I kept going back and forth in my theories   Megan  Rachel  Scott  the therapist  Rachel  Anna  Rachel  Megan  Anna and Tom  Rachel  Scott  Rachel    And I was thisclose to getting frustrated with the pace and screaming for an answer already when things started to become clear  Even though not one character in this book was likable  the book itself definitely was   This book had me from the first page  Although it s not great literature  it s a page turner  Three quarters of the way through the book  I realized who the murderer was  but I read to the end  A good summer read  This is the same suspense genre as Gone Girl and The Memory Box   so far  much better than the Memory Box  I m listening to the Audible version and the female narrators are very good  Rachel is a girl on the train  commuting back and forth each day to work  She gazes out the window each day and fantasizes about the people she sees as the train goes past their houses and backyards  She looks at the house she used to share with her husband  who now lives there with his new wife and sees pale pink curtains in the 2nd bedroom window  signifying a baby girl  and gets tears in her eyes while sitting on the train  She also sees a couple she names  Jason and Jess   sitting outside on their deck having coffee or drinks a few doors down from the other house  She wishes she was them  Then one day she sees  Jess  passionately kissing another man    2 25 15Just finished this excellent book  I thought it was great  suspenseful throughout the entire story  Rachel is a flawed  somewhat unreliable narrator  but I always felt sympathetic towards her personally  The other two protagonists were both women and we heard from their perspectives on alternate chapters  but I felt they didn t grow from their experiences  against all odds  the same way Rachel did  It is about a series of love triangles  with a sinister twist  and a very satisfying ending  That s all I can say without giving anything away  Very well written  the author really gets into the mind of her characters  Like I told the friend who loaned it to me     this book is weirdly addicting   2015 Reading Challenge  A mystery or thriller  14 50   LOL THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GONE GIRL WTF GUYS  a hem I wanted to read this book because I thought it was gonna be a good read  Then I read some reviews about it and many of the reviews kept comparing this book to Gone Girl   BUT THEY ARE NOTHING ALIKE      THE ONLY THING IT HAS IN COMMON IS THAT IT S A MYSTERY THRILLER  BUT THAT S IT      IF YOU HATED GONE GIRL  YOU MIGHT STILL LIKE THIS     So  NOW that this is out of the way    let s begin the actual review The story is told in 3 point of views  Rachel s  Anna s and Megan s Rachel is an alcoholic who lost her job and was cheated on by her husband  who then left her for the new girl Anna is the bitch was the mistress  is now the wife of Rachel s ex husband and has a daughter  Eve  who is but a baby Megan used to be Eve s babysitter and is Anna s neighbour Rachel had nowhere else to live  so she asked a College s Acquaintance if she could live with her until she sorts things out  Her acquaintance doesn t know that she s jobless as well  so Rachel takes the train everyday to  go to work  so she doesn t suspect a thing  and that s how it begins  Everytime she looks out of the window  she sees a house with a husband and a wife  They seem happy and at peace  and since her own life is a mess  she starts to create a life in her head for them  she calls them   Jess and Jason   Until one day  she sees something she s not supposed to see  And instead of keeping it to herself  she decides to tell it to the police  She gets involved That s pretty much all I can say without saying any spoilers  though  PThe Girl on the Train was a fun read  It wasn t spectacular like I was expecting  but it wasn t boring either  Some parts were better than others  but overall it was easy enough to keep reading  The thrilling parts were stronger towards the end  and I must say that I didn t see it coming  I should  because once you find out what happened  you think  HOW DIDN T I REALIZE THIS BEFORE       P 4 25 StarsSo this was not what I was expecting  Very addicting with an intriguing plot and very annoying  irritating messed up characters  Ending was a bit flat as it was a little obvious as to the whole mystery and everything  but overall a thrilling  compelling read  I recommend    really enjoyed this  kept me guessing i find it interesting that so many people took issue with the characters  they are  absolutely  often unlikable  selfish  messes   but that s what rings so true  don t we all have some semblance to this  in our hearts of hearts  aren t we all imperfect  selfish  self absorbed and even depraved a times  come on  lets be real  i think it s brave to write a story that tells of human nature so unflinchingly  we might not be just like the characters  but we ve all had those sorts of moments  i liked that i didn t like the characters  i liked that i often flinched at their thoughts and actions  it was like reading someone s diary  someone said it perfectly  while i didn t always like the characters  i loved the book  YES  I admit it  I am one of those people who enjoy looking into houses where the blinds are open at night and you can see people watching tv or reading a book  The person my late mother in law feared as she religiously closed her blinds every evening the minute twilight appeared   This book will make you think twice about such a thing   Three women are featured in this mystery   Rachel  the jilted wife turned alcoholic who has lost her job but continues to ride the train into London each day  Anna  Tom s new wife and mother of his child who is fearful of Rachel and finally Megan  a rather lost soul who cannot seem to get her life together  Anna and Tom continue to live in the house that Tom shared with Rachel and Rachel feels compelled to look at her old home each time she rides by it on the train  In looking at her old home  she sees the perfect couple who live down the street  Scott and Megan  The couple that she and Tom were before Anna  But as with many of our perceptions Rachel is dead wrong  When Megan turns up missing  Rachel feels she must work to find out what happened  I will say that of all three women  I liked Rachel the best  Even though she was her own worst enemy  you could see the good heart that was there  Anna seemed rather annoying to me and Megan was just a character that I could not identify with at all  This book will keep you reading and pulling for the women to find out what exactly happened to Megan   A seriously great psychological thriller  For fans of Gone Girl   just as well written and surprising  with similar uncomfortable truths about love  addiction  and perception weaving through the narrative  despite its genre  But  with a VERY different ending from any Gillian Flynn  so don t think it s more of the same   THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN  by Paula Hawkins is a whodunit beachread  If you want a mystery to devour  this is the book for you  If you liked Gone Girl  this is the book for you  Because that s exactly what this is  Gone Girl fan fiction  I m sure the use of the word  Girl  in the title was intentional  I won t say I disliked this book  but I will say it s derivative  Rachel is the girl who rides the train  to and from London  each day to a non existant job  She was fired because she s an alcoholic  Perhaps Hawkins was trying to say something about the evils of alcohol  or perhaps she just needed an excuse to make the protagonist an unreliable narrator  Now  I like unreliable narrators  but Rachel s talk of acquiring drinking recovering from her alcoholic binges became tedious over the first fifty pages  It wasn t until page 54  I read the ebook version  that this story got rolling  That s when Megan  the woman that Rachel  stalks  from her train window each day  went missing  What I liked best about The Girl On The Train was that I couldn t guess who was responsible for Megan s disappearance  A good whodunit has to keep the reader guessing  and this did  Hawkins also threw in a few poignant and insightful lines that I loved  My favorite was something  Megan  realized while in therapy       the holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete      I believe that to be true  yet I d never thought of it that way Unfortunately  I felt Rachel was an unrealistic character  even taking her alcoholism into account  She inserts herself into the mess of solving the crime  I imagine most alcoholics would be too self centered to go to the trouble   She makes unrealistic decisions  like the idiots in horror movies  you get the picture  that totally frustrated me  But maybe I expect too much    Three and a half Stars  rounded to four because I can recommend this to my friends who want an exciting book but aren t as critical as I am   Great Story But   The story itself is well written however  I was thoroughly sick of the main character s drinking problems  Aside from that  the only thing I didn t like about this story was the fact that the characters were unlikable people  every single one of them  The ending does have a good twist which I enjoyed  It would depend upon the person I was talking to whether or not I d recommend this book  If it s just a good story you re after and you don t mind the characters all being pathetic  then I would say read and enjoy  Popularity is a problem for me  Movies  books     it doesn t matter  if I hear something is great  I go in with high expectations and often feel let down  On the other hand  if I hear something is terrible  I am just as likely to come away pleasantly surprised  So I try not to listen   and with this book I tried very hard  but from my peripheral vision I knew that people were talking about this book  That bothered me a little  but I went ahead anyway With that said  I had some trouble reading it     I didn t really like the main character   actually  none of the characters were very likable to me  They were extremely well written  however   this book begins less the mystery I was expecting and more of a study of the characters  their missteps and self deceptions  and how these come together to form a mystery  In the middle of the book I was afraid that it wouldn t come together   Rachel seemed to much a mess   but it did  and I closed the book on the last page feeling pretty good about the journey  Warning  not a single healthy relationship in this book  Everyone is more concerned with themselves than others  not willing to give others the benefit of the doubt  or a sociopath  so if you are less than happy with your fellow man at the moment  hold off on reading this book till you are in a more positive state of mind  I think if it hadn t been the holiday season I would ve had more time to just sit down with this book and have it take up all of my time  but it didn t happen that way  The point is  this book was good  And definitely was good for filling the  I finally read GONE GIRL  what should I read next  need that I had Every once in a while I stare off at some train passengers  and even more rare if I m on an above ground subway  Maybe I won t look out the window the same way again   who knows But the book was good  Definitely left me guessing  Do pick this one up when it comes out in January  Very reminiscent of Gone Girl  Horrible people  good writing and story   Wow  4 5 stars  I just finished listening to this on Audible com  It s almost 2 in the morning and I m wide awake  What a great story  It took me back to some of the very best of the Hitchcock thrillers  Every character in the novel is flawed in some way  some more than others  Their lives intertwine in so many ways and it kept me guessing  almost  until the very end  If you are looking for a good old fashioned suspenseful page turner  take this train ride  I ll be looking for more books by Paula Hawkins  And by the way  the narration on this audiobook is superb   very good  very suspenseful  the story is told from 3 characters points of view  each speaking in the 1st person  and moves back and forth from present to the past  so i was a little confused in the beginning  but each chapter is named for the person who is talking so once i started paying attention i had no problem   As a standard whodunnit  it was nicely executed  I was surprised at several of the turns the story took  including the last big reveal  What intrigued me even more was the conceit of three first person narrators  all of them deeply flawed  I wouldn t want to befriend any of them in life  but peering into their lives was fascinating  And it s always a nice reminder that you have no idea just how wretched a person s life may be  no matter how perfect it may seem from a comfortable distance   Usually  I guess the ending halfway through  Not this one  not until the last couple of chapters  Up until that point  my list of suspects just kept growing  I ve heard this compared to Gone Girl and for once I agree with the comparison  Loved the multiple perspectives   This book was really good and      really creepy  Innovative story telling that readily kept my interest  And I do wish they would stop calling it the next  Gone Girl   There are similarities I suppose and I agree with someone s review about neither book having one likeable character but I think it does this novel a disservice by making the comparison  This book has more of a Hitchcock feel and a cleverness that doesn t exist in GG  Highly recommended  Age of the unreliable narratorFun little read  The narrator is so unreliable that it kept me guessing loss of different scenarios  frankly  more complex and interesting ones than what it actually turned out to be  Still  I enjoyed the story   When I started this book I had my doubts I would finish it  I m glad I didn t give up  but it does take patience to read if you prefer your books a bit more fast paced  It builds up quite slowly  I enjoy books that get straight in there  so this was quite a challenge for me  What I did love about the book though is it does keep you guessing and I lost count how many times I changed my mind about who I thought the guilty person was  I suspected different characters in certain parts of the book  that s what made me carry on reading  I felt quite close to Megan  which did leave me feeling sad at a certain point in the story  I certainly didn t see that coming out about her past  I have marked the book 4 stars due to the slow build up  I think we can all relate to Rachel though regarding looking out the train window  I certainly do what she does when I travel by train  THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a dark  haunting and depressing psychological thriller  but it s incredibly effective thanks to the writing skills of author Paula Hawkins  This rather bleak story with intersecting timelines is told from the viewpoint of three different women Rachel  Anne and Megan  All the women are unreliable narrators with something to hide  In fact  most of the characters in this novel  including the men  lack veracity  and are a self serving and unsympathetic group with plenty of skeletons in their closets  Lest I continue and divulge too much of the plot  let me just say that the twists and turns in the story are many and readers will be easily drawn in  making it easy to devour this book  I d definitely encourage you to read this book and formulate your own opinions  So many people have absolutely loved it in its entirety  and been shocked by the way everything transpires  so perhaps you will as well  I think for the most part  this is a pretty great book  and I look forward to seeing what comes next in Hawkins  career  Fast read  This is billed as   If you liked Gone Girl  you ll love The Girl on the Train   Yes  it was really good and had my heart pumping at the end  but it took a long time to get to the twisted part  It kept me guessing all the way through  however  and I do recommend it  It was a little slow to get into but once I got to the good part I couldn t put it down and the ending was great  Highly recommend   Picked up this book at the airport to keep myself occupied on the long flight to Doha  Perhaps its a testament to the strength of the novel as a thriller and murder mystery that I managed to finish it in one sitting  Its absolutely gripping  and with enough twist and turns to make you impatient to found out who did it  One particular fascinating aspect of this novel is that almost everyone in this book  with the probably exception of Rachel s overly nice housemate  is an awful human being  Some  such as the protagonist Rachel  an alcoholic washup with almost no direction in life  may be slightly better morally and in deeper character than others  such as Megan  Rachel s  Jesse   or Anna  Rachel s husband s new wife   As we progress through the book  and we dig deeper into the characters  even the characters we thought initially came off as kind hearted we soon discover to have much darker  often shocking  secrets and character flaws  Another thing which is interesting about this novel is the ability of the author to weave all the lives of the seemingly unconnected characters into one larger narrative  Initially  what makes the book initially fascinating to me was that it seemed to concern a protagonist with seemingly no prior involvement in the live s of this particular couple suddenly being forced into it by sheer coincidence  in this case having passed by their house everyday on the subway   However  as we progress through the story we discover often surprising connections between the characters which only makes the story more gripping insofar that it makes the story both clearer and paradoxically raises more question  thus forcing you to continue reading Since the author is female  it probably makes sense that this novel is written purely from the perspectives of almost all the female protagonists in the story  This unique writing style allows us to to continuously flesh out the story by analyzing particular events through the memories of each character involved  using their experiences to fully understand what had happened  rather than being forced to rely on solely one character s experiences as more traditional novels may have done  This becomes important when we later discover how certain protagonists can be unreliable witnesses  Indeed  with Rachel  who s such an alcoholic mess  this is crucial for the reader to get a better grip of important events in the story  Overall  this is a dark story  and anyone hoping for more uplifting material would be advised to stay away from this  However  for people who enjoy the occasional dark murder mystery with well done twists and turns  happy reading   Murder in Subburbia A fast paced domestic thriller that moves in a linear way backwards and forwards in time much like the train that travels past the homes or former homes of the protagonists  The author keeps us guessing as she unpacks her characters personalities and histories as to who has actually done what  There are no heroes or heroines here  Only victims  If like me you ve lived in a house that backs into a railway line you will recognise the way in which it s easy to get used to and discount this daily casual invasion of privacy and appreciate a well crafted story around this   I d say 3 5 because it felt a tad slow in places  and some of it didn t quite add up for me  I found I didn t connect with or GAF about any of the characters   I spent the whole book  knowing something was wrong  but couldn t figure out what is was  Ms  Hawkins successfully takes the reader on a wild ride of blackouts  lost memories  haunting pasts  and the pain of facing reality all wrapped up in one of the best thrillers I ve read this past year  Not a single likeable character in the entire book but one heck of a page turner  Told from the perspectives of three female characters who have made train wrecks of their lives  I found it hard to look away  Which made it an excellent read on the plane  I have owned this book for a while now  found it at a library sale for  1  but I was always hesitant to start it  I ve never really delved into adult fiction but when my coblogger and one of my best bookish friends  Audris  texted me to say she was starting this  I knew I had to read it with her  I picked it up and oh boy  am I so glad I did It definitely wasn t hard to read like I was anticipating  It read like a bit more mature YA mystery which I really enjoyed  It moved very quickly and there were always new discoveries being made that kept me glued to the pages  I really enjoyed the multiple point of views and timelines  I felt like they were necessary for this story line and it definitely made the book better  Each point of view was able to be differentiated and each person had a different voice  which I definitely appreciated  The timeline was a bit confusing at times  different times months years  so I kept having to check the dates but that is a minor complaint looking back on the entirety of it This book was definitely a great book to buddy read  All day Audris and I were texting each other and reading the same chapter simultaneously so we could throw out theories and discuss  Audris is such an amazing person to buddy read with  but especially with mystery novels  She is always so on top of everything and she actually figured out the mystery  Once she texted me  it was so fun to put all of of the pieces together I wasn t expecting the ending so it totally took me off guard but I really enjoyed it  My one complaint is these character s actions  I questioned basically every single thing they did  It felt as if they had no common sense and I understand that Rachel was an unreliable character but I am talking about ALL of the characters  I wanted to scream at them and ask where their brain went during all of this Overall  an enjoyable mystery novel that had me glued to the pages  Definitely would recommend  Ca se lit donc tres vite  parce que ce sont de courts chapitres et que l envie de savoir est tres motivante     Je comprends les comparaisons avec Gone Girl  meme si les histoires sont tres differentes  on retrouve le narrateur peu fiable et les apparences trompeuses    apres il faut aimer se laisser manipuler et se prendre au jeu  mais c etait tout a fait ce dont j avais besoin apres plusieurs jours ou j etais moyennement motivee par ce que je lisais   Apesar de ter acertado a primeira na pessoa responsavel pelo crime  mesmo assim arrepiei me com todos os contornos relacionados com a situacao chave da historia  Gostei particularmente da forma como o narrador nos desarmava por completo com afirmacoes inesperadas  Uma leitura interessante  This book was one of those truly fantastic psychological thrillers that comes along only very rarely  I devoured this audiobook  It was great to finally end a reading slump I d been in with such an addictive book  A book that is so annoyingly addictive that it s almost painful when you have to stop reading so that you can do things  like have a life  work  sleep  etc  People have been comparing this to Gone Girl quite a bit  and I can see what they mean  however  this is quite different  Similarities include an unreliable narrator and that it s an addictive psychological thriller  Otherwise  it s quite different  This book has three different narrators  all sharing their points of view  from different points of time  I really enjoyed this  and particularly like that the audiobook had three different narrators for each character  I found one of the speakers to have a particularly annoying  grating voice  another to have quite an irritating  husky voice  but luckily for me  I really enjoyed the main speaker  I know this is mostly personal preference  but it can certainly have an impact on how I feel about an audiobook The main narrator of the story is Rachel  One is led to feel sorry for Rachel as she is suffering a lot of depression and anguish from her recent divorce  Her husband left her for another woman and she lost everything  her house  her husband and her dream life  As the story goes on  we learn more and more about Rachel s past  This act of not lying to the reader  but withholding information is something can be done really badly  or really well  Paula Hawkins nailed it  You can tell that there is something slightly off about Rachel from the beginning  and we soon learn that Rachel is currently battling a drinking problem  This is a brilliant way for the author to have an unreliable narrator  as Rachel suffers from black outs after her excessive drinking  So not only is she sometimes withholding information  but other times  she really just cannot remember what happened A similar thing goes for the other two characters  Certain things are withheld for a while  until the reader slowly starts to piece things together  It was amazing A lot of these characters are not very nice  but you also feel sorry for them  Anna  the woman that Rachel s husband left her for  is at first obviously seen as the enemy  We feel sorry for Rachel as this woman came in and ruined her life  However  as certain things come undone  we start to feel slightly sorry for Anna I really didn t pick any of the things that happen throughout the book  so was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of everything  particularly the ending  There is certainly a build up to the climax  as the story shifts between narrators and dates  As the days go on and Rachel is trying to piece together what happened to Megan  while Megan s point of view gets closer and closer to the date she went missing I really couldn t recommend this book enough  I absolutely loved it  I have been trying to find a similar book to read since  but have had no luck I am eagerly awaiting any other book that Paula Hawkins publishes  because WOW  That woman can write  Everyone is all a buzz about this book  and I totally understand why  It s compelling and oh so hard to put down  I read it over the course of two afternoons and was mad each time I had to stop  A couple of things  I hate all the main characters  which is never a book turn off for me  I actually like it better when I hate the characters  It s impossible to like Rachel  Every thing she does is cringe worthy and I found myself constantly congratulating myself on my good life choices as she fell further and further down the rabbit hole  Megan is impossible to like for so many reasons  although you sort of want to at the beginning  Anna is just a bitch  obviously  I figured out the twist about halfway through  It was the way something was worded that gave it away to me  The writing is what made the book  I think it would have been just another thriller if it wasn t for the nuanced characters and careful plotting  Unlike so many people complained about with Gone Girl  I LIKED THE ENDING  SO SUE ME   the end is totally satisfying  That s not a spoiler  just a fact  This is a spoiler   view spoiler  OMG the corkscrew   Go Anna    hide spoiler   Slow with buildup but the climax is exceptional  The presentation of the book is something that is unique  The way  the story is narrated by the author makes this book a must read   Everyone keeps saying that the culprit was easy to figure out but I didn t know until the end  Very strong audiobook and highly recommend to those looking for a thriller  I can definitely see the Gone Girl similarities but felt more of a connection with these cringe worthy characters   I really loved this book  Although none of the characters were particularly likable in the traditional sense  I came to like Rachel and root for her  She was SO frustrating at times  but in the end  I still liked her  I have to admit that I had no idea how or why Megan disappeared until the very end of the book when it was finally revealed  Maybe I m naive  but I have to think others had the same experience  Highly recommended this book  but beware   it s one of those that you just can t put down  I can definitely see this one being turned into a movie   Raise your hand if you love books that royally screw with your mind and have really twisted  unstable characters that make you cringe and question all of humanity    Both of my hands are raised high and I m jumping up and down saying  ME  I do    I can t help but adore books that royally screw with my mind and have really twisted  unstable characters that make me cringe and question all of humanity    because they are so damn fun  I hate to be like everyone else and describe The Girl on the Train as a faster paced  more suspenseful Gone Girl  but that s actually a pretty good way to describe it  What I mean is that if you liked Gone Girl  you will love The Girl on the Train  Neither book is  pretty  and are at times awfully disturbing  Hawkins also seems to share Flynn s talent for creating really unlikable  nasty characters and having the story play out in their unstable  untrustworthy points of view  So I get it if these books aren t for everyone  which is why I wanted to make the claim that Gillian Flynn fans will have their socks rocked off by The Girl on the Train   Despite similarities  these books are each very unique in terms of plot and will keep you guessing until the very end  I mentioned that books like this make me distrust people in general and although it s unsettling  it s kind of part of the appeal and suspense  You could ride the elevator with people just like these characters every day    or sit by them in church    or sleep next to them every night     shivers   Rachel  the main character in The Girl on the Train obsesses over a young couple whose house is passed by the train she rides every day  She fixates on them  imagines intimate details of their lives  I don t live by train tracks  but still    Creepy to think about being on a stranger s mind like that   again with the shivers   And on a final random thought  I ve always been a litttle in love with the roar and whistle of a passing train  Imagining the sound really added to the reading experience for me  but I m probably the only weirdo who did that     Loved having my mind messed with by The Girl on the Train  I enjoyed this one  It took me a wee bit to get into it but by then end I couldn t put it down  It reminded me a little bit of a Gillian Flynn novel with flawed not very likeable characters  Very good for a debut novel though Before I read the comments  I thought to myself  This reminds me a lot of Gone Girl   Turns out  a lot of other people thought the same thing  The beginning was a little slow but once Megan Jess disappeared  it started to get very good and I couldn t put it down  I listened to the audio book and the readers were very good   Bueno  me gusto este libro    es diferente a lo que leo pero definitivamente merece la pena  En general durante toda la lectura sientes ese ambiente sombrio  con todos los personajes  sientes el misterio y la ansiedad por saber quien es el que lo hizo  El personaje de Rachel es interesante  creo que aunque se pueda pensar que es patetico la forma en que ve el mundo es real y aunque depresiva realmente me llego  Tambien los otros personajes son buenos y todos tienen ese lado donde puedes odiarlos pero sabes que no puedes juzgarlos De lo unico que me podria quejar seria el final  fue entre apresurado y no creo que despertara tanto la emocion que me esperaba  Lo confieso  habia leido el spoiler del final  asi que esperaba que todo fuera mas fuerte y creible  no se creo que fue bastante flojo y en algunas partes no entendia el porque  Por eso las cuatro estrellas Ahora  creo que leere Perdida  Era de esperarse que lo leyera primero  pero siempre es bueno jugar con eso  Y definitivamente espero como estara la pelicula  sera interesante  Si  si   I enjoyed this book a lot more than I had originally anticipated  I found the main character  Rachel  to be very annoying  mainly because I have very little sympathy for alcoholics who worsen their own situation  I also thought it was absolutely ridiculous that she wanted to be involved with something so beyond her understanding  and I found the absolute faith she had in the fantasies she created  in the face of evidence that literally no one is who she thought them to be  aggravating  All this said  the plot had me hooked  I wanted to know what was in the black spots in Rachel s memory  I wanted to know what happened to Megan  I trudged through my dislike of Rachel  and it was absolutely worth it  The story was great  and once the plot picks up it was a breeze to read  It s a fantastic read  and I m sure there are plenty of people who wouldn t be as annoyed with Rachel as I was  4 5 stars  it was an enjoyable read  but the dragging caused by Rachel s alcoholism certainly impaired a lot of my enjoyment  This book was better than I expected  I thought it was just going to be another thriller about a husband murdering his wife or something close to that  The mystery of the book  or the  thrilling  part  was actually pretty basic  Happy married couples  Crazy ex wife  Children  Cheating  This was all something I did expect  but what I really enjoyed was getting into Rachel s head and experiencing the alcoholic that she was  How she just couldn t resist a drink and how the disappearance of Megan made her feel like she had a purpose in life again  It made me understand alcoholism a lot better than I previously did  I also enjoyed all the different relationships and how they all intertwined really well  some more than others  but that s to be expected I didn t actually predict the ending at first  which is unusual for me  so plus points to Paula Hawkins for great writing  I ve also seen this book compared to Gone Girl  which is a book I never managed to finish because it was just too damned slow  so another plus point there  I  however  think that this book is probably more suited for people who are just starting out in the thriller genre or for someone who just want a quick  light read because for some reason I could not put this book down  Oh but how I love unreliable narrators  Divisive as this book seems to be  I have to say I loved the way in which the author walked the fine line with her characters  A friend described this book as a  bucket full of crazy  and I would have to agree  But given that I like bucket full of crazy books  I really enjoyed this   Gone Girl definitely sparked my interest in modern day thrillers  and Hawkins was able to keep that spark alive  The haunting malice of suspicion is the central theme of the story  a large theme of many thrillers  if not explicitly stated  With an unreliable  alcoholic protagonist  grappling with life s vicissitudes on a train back and forth to London  it s extremely exhilarating to progress throughout this book amidst belief and disbelief  Feel sorry for Rachel  connect with Rachel  despise Rachel  that s for you to decide  which is a compelling component of this read  You ll be shocked by the plot twists and the continual thwarts Rachel inflicts upon herself due in part to her destructive lifestyle Honestly  I was in the midst of finals when I read this book and still couldn t put it down  Every break I took  every night before falling asleep  I had to know more  I hope you find yourself on the same seat as me  opposite of Rachel  wondering what the hell is going on   The Girl On The Train was a very good thriller  It can become a little confusing at times so I suggest reading it in a quiet place  Pay attention to the story and you will definitely find yourself flipping back through the book and checking if you read that correctly  It is exciting and builds up the pace even though there in an underlying somber tone throughout the novel  You can definitely label it a Thriller  There is a young lady that takes the train into work everyday  She passes by the same homes  every morning and evening  After witnessing a horrific crime  she finds her life turned upside down  There are many story lines intertwining through the novel and they all build up to a gigantic climax  I do not want to give anything away so I will keep the review as vague as possible   I chose the audio version of this book since I have a long commute to and from work  and it was just what I needed to make the commute  shorter   Suspenseful and an excellent mystery  it kept me engaged as a reader till the very end  Each character narrator was clearly drawn  and I especially loved that the main protagonist  Rachel  was so undependable due to her drinking   it added another level of difficulty in solving the mystery  Loved this book  Riverhead is doing a great marketing job for this book  right down to its very clever cover  But  reader  be warned  after all this hype  THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN may disappoint  While it will keep your attention  it probably won t be as unputdownable as claimed until the last couple of chapters  It wasn t for me The girl on the train is Rachel  She s a raging alcoholic who has opinions about people that are often based on nothing and are always wrong  The entire book is about her alcoholic blackouts and figuring out what really happened  Some things about this book are aggravating  For instance  during tense moments  characters  especially Rachel  bite their lips  often so hard they draw blood  I could just imagine all the people walking around with bloody mouths they had chewed The biggest aggravation is difficult to describe without saying too much and spoiling the story  It has to do with how everything is explained in the end  It really wouldn t happen that way and is too hard to swallow Yet  even considering these and other faults  the book still rates four stars  That is simply because it kept my attention more than books I ve rated with three stars I won this ARC from the publisher and librarything com  I had every intention of reading a few chapters before bedtime   Now  I find myself at 5 a m   with only 20 pages remaining  Updated Review  16 hours after finishing  and still thinking about it  I became so utterly immersed in this story  I just could not stop reading  I HAD to know what happened  I found myself questioning each person involved at some point or another My only regret is  not my lost lack of sleep  but that it is over I truly hope that Paula Hawkins is currently weaving another incredible story I received this book from a GoodReads giveaway  KlappentextAuf alle anderen in diesem Abteil wirke ich vollig normal  ich tue  was sie tun  zur Arbeit pendeln  Termine machen  Dinge erledigen  Wie man sich irren kann

Silberbirke bei den alten Gleisen unter einem Steinhugel Meine MeinungAuf   Girl on the Train   war ich unheimlich neugierig  ich musste es unbedingt haben und gleich lesen  Unsere Sommerlichen Temperaturen passten in diesem Fall wirklich sehr gut zur Geschichte   Mit der Protagonistin Rachel wurde ich am Anfang gar nicht warm  sie war mir unsympathisch und ihr verhalten empfand ich zu Beginn der Geschichte mehr als fraglich  Auch mit Megan wurde ich nicht sofort warm  Der Anfang von Girl on the Train zog sich sehr  es dauerte einige Seiten bis die Geschichte ihren Reiz und ihre Fahrt aufnahm  aber dann oho konnte mich die Autorin Paula Hawkins ans Buch fesseln  Mehr mag ich euch gar nicht verraten ihr musst es lesen FazitNicht nur fur Pendler eine Leseempfehlung  Wer Drama liebt  sollte zugreifen  There are not enough words to describe how fast I flew through this novel to figure out what in the heck is going on  Not usually a thriller genre type of reader  I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly obsessed and immersed I became with the story  Just when I thought I had something figure out  bam  Hawkins hits me with another curve ball I ll be honest  at first  I was concerned that the story would be closely related to that of Gone Girl  however although there were some moments of deja vu  I believe that The Girl on the Train has its own fresh storyline and twists and turns throughout  How could it not when the plot never slows down  especially with the help of smooth transitions of perspective to perspective  each one ending on a cliffhanger  I loved how no main character remained consistent in my opinions of them as I  along with each of the three women  were trying to figure out what happened  My emotions ranged from pity to hatred and anxiety to fear over and over throughout the story  There were moments where I had no idea what to think and I wanted to throw my hands in the air and give up trying to figure it all out  Read The Girl on the Train if you like the themes of  Jealousy Relationships Obsession Alcoholism  Counseling it is a little slow to start but rolls along less than half way stick to it as it reminds me of a hitchcock movie with twists and psychological thoughts  Wow  Seriously gripping story  Didn t know who did it untilthe very end  Sebenarnya mau ngasih bintang 3 5  Review selengkapnya menyusul   Lots of suspense and mystery to carry me along as I listened to the Audible version  That was fun because I enjoyed the accents  The story was interesting and unfolded gradually through the eyes  and voices  of 3 women  A fun book to read or hear while driving or traveling   Mind blown  That s all I ve got  Ready for the movie   Cause you know it s coming   As far as mysteries go  this followed the usual plot scheme  You get glimpses into the victim s life  Suspects are found  Suspects are found innocent despite misgivings otherwise  The actual killer is discovered in the end  and the protagonist s life is at stake when confronting the killer in one last struggle before the book is resolved It s a good scheme  It works for a reason What I loved about Paula Hawkins s book is that she added to that scheme elements you don t always find in novels  The protagonist wasn t supposed to be heavily involved in the mystery  She wasn t a journalist  a detective  a family member of the victim  a witness  or even a close neighbor  She was an alcoholic  brokenhearted  commuter who saw the victim on a regular basis as she rode the train The author also gave us a heavily flawed protagonist  Rachel lets us into her world of struggling with day to day life  She shows us how she s drowning in the world as it is and turns to alcohol to escape from that  The struggle and the pain make her real  The addiction makes her vulnerable  As far as realistic characters go  Paula Hawkins has created one of the best  La chica del tren es de esos libros que hay que leer sin conocer nada sobre el  asi que no voy a decir mucho sobre su trama  Solo dire que  aunque al principio todo parezca super confuso y nada parezca tener sentido  al final las historias se van acercando y todo va encajando  Y hasta aqui puedo leer  O escribir  mas bien En cuanto a mi opinion sobre el libro he de deciros que me ha gustado muchisimo  He leido muy pocos libros de este genero y me ha gustado la experiencia  Cuando comence a leerlo casi me vuelvo loca  nada tenia sentido e incluso tuve que anotar a parte quien era cada personaje para no hacerme un lio  Pero luego todo cobra sentido  El libro esta escrito de forma que hace que te montes tus propias teorias  tus propias sospechas Ademas  la historia no esta contada por un solo personaje  sino que se nos dan varias visiones  lo que nos hace ir encajando todas las partes Por poner una pega  he de decir que la autora complica y enreda la historia quiza demasiado para la resolucion que tiene todo al final  aunque en ningun momento lo habia imaginado  Pero en general  el libro merece mucho la pena  y por ello le he puesto 4 estrellas sobre 5  I listened to this over a week and a half and I enjoyed it  This story follows three women  Rachel  Anna  and Meghan  Rachel is the drunk ex wife  Anna is the beautiful new wife  And Meghan is the beautiful dead girl  The story starts out with Rachel riding the train into and out of London everyday  Everyday she passes two houses  one with Meghan where she fantasizes about the wonderful life they have and then also Anna s  which used to be hers  where she curses her ex husband and his new wife  Then one day Meghan goes missing and Rachel gets a little too involved in the investigation  She is convinced she knows who has done it  Then she starts questioning it all starts wondering if her memory is right  If Meghan was who she thought she was  All of the sudden the truth comes to her  At first in flashes and then in a huge wave  It was a compelling listen  I grew attached to the characters and their situations  I felt for Rachel and hated Anna  It was just so well written  My biggest grip is that the switching between characters was annoying and difficult to change tracks again  especially since it switches dates all the time  It just gets very distracting  This is only the third suspense or thriller kind of read I have ever read listened to and I think I am really getting into the genre  I enjoy trying to figure out the mystery and the twists and turns   Good twist at the end  A little tedious in the middle   I really enjoyed this book  I got it by chance as a present as I was unsure about purchasing it my myself but I must say   I loved it I gave it four out of five stars due to ending  Although the ending was not terrible  I wished the author explained what happened to the other characters that I lives I was reading  what happened to Anna and Evie  What happened to Scott  The book ended abruptly with all that happened in the last chapters just to have the last chapter be Rachel moving away and finally stop drinking  BUT SERIOUSLY WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHERS   As Rachel stated  the houses of Scott and Anna are now empty I pace of the book was favorable which kept me reading  there was always something happening  always something revealing into the characters lives and always a reason for me to continue reading  I haven t really read many thriller books but this one gave me a good impression of the genre  I felt Paula s writing style was simple and engaging which is what I enjoyed in the book  the sentences were not so stretched out or the chapters which meant I could comfortably reach an end of a chapter before I had to set the book down Overall  I really did enjoy this book but the ending still bothers me  I was invested in not just Rachel s life but the others and not knowing how Anna and Evie continued after Tom s murder and Scott being cleared makes me wonder  Before I decided to read this book  it was everywhere  Lists of books to read now that you d finished this book and awards it had won  etc  I checked out a few reviews of it  to see what everyone said  and though most of the reviews were positive or were only negative for what I took to be unimportant reasons  like the cussing   I was surprised to see that a lot of people claimed they had figured out the twist  I thought to myself  yeah  sure  I m sure you all figured it out  I thought  if it really were that easy to figure out  it wouldn t be so popular  Well  it is that easy  As soon as we get introduced to everyone and learn the basics of what s going on  it s pretty obvious  I thought maybe that was a trick  make one person seem obvious from the start and then have it be someone else  Nope  no surprises there  Despite this  the book was actually still a very interesting and compelling read  Since I felt sure I must be wrong  I kept wanting to read so much to find out what had really happened  Well written  fast paced  all those things a good thriller should have  My only other complaint is that I wish Rachel were a tiny bit more likeable  and also slightly less stupid  All that drinking struck me as idiotic  but I guess fairly in character  A good read  definitely interesting enough to warrant the acclaim  but not much of a twist  sadly  wow    loved it     expected more of a surprise at the end but overall a good read     hard to put down at times When are we going to stop promoting books with female protagonists as being the  next Gone Girl   This was a good book  Don t get me wrong  But it ain t no Gone Girl I m sure this is an outstanding book to simply read  but it s even more thrilling when you listen to the audiobook  like I did   I have wanted to read this book for AGES and it finally came through to me on the library wait list  I was SO EXCITED  And I certainly wasn t disappointed Rachel was so sad  So  so sad  I felt so bad for her  but I also know that she was semi to blame for her situation  I felt for her  wanting to be involved so desperately in a situation she wasn t really involved with at all  She wanted to be a part of something exciting and that made so much sense to me I didn t sympathize as much with Megan until she revealed her big secret  but even then  she wasn t very likeable  I was often irritated with her intense longing for a new life because she could just go and do it Anna made me want to hurt someone  What a bad person  I got so tired of her talking about how important being a mother is  She said at one point that she felt like she should be paid for being a mother  I don t understand that  It was very annoying  Also  didn t like how she LOVED that she was a mistress  Cheaters suck  but she was pretty terrible  I definitely caught on to the big twist before it was revealed  but I still felt like I caught on way later than everyone else who has read this  What can I say  I love being tricked and not knowing what the big surprise is until the very last second  It was a good book  Not a new  Gone Girl   but a good book  It would translate well into a movie  It s definitely for people who like reading from different perspectives and like reading about women with problems  A good  fast paced  easy read  I loved the idea of watching someone else s life from the train   and then finding yourself involved in something you d imagined   that was probably the creepiest part of this book  I have read others say that it is a twisted  messed up story  and certainly the characters are not normal  or are they     some have compared it to Gone Girl   I have not read that yet  so cannot make the comparison  But after reading other reviews on how  sick  and  twisted  this was  meh  It wasn t that for me at all  A smidge anticlimatic  but still a fast  gripping read  Gostei bastante mas a meio do livro ja tinha percebido quem era o assassino  Amazing debut thriller  The story had me with every twist and turn right up to the end  This novel is told from the perspective of three different women  Rachel  Megan and Anna  and centers on the disappearance of Megan  Rachel is an unemployed  divorcee with a drinking problem that makes her prone to blackouts  Megan is a young married woman with a troubled past and a propensity to run away from things  Anna is the new wife  and former mistress  of Rachel s ex husband Each woman narrator is as unreliable as the next  but each in her own way  So  if you don t enjoy a first person  unreliable narrator  this book will have you crawling the walls and looking for sharp things to jab into your eyes Personally  I love a look into an addled mind  I mean  it freaks me out and haunts me for days  much like Gillian Flynn s novels  but I love it  I have the belief that there are people out in the world that think and act just as these characters do  They see what they want to see  believe what they want to believe  rationalize things to fit their world view and do exactly what they want to do  It s scarier than a horror flick  being inside a mind like that and then realizing that you do some of the exact same things  and  in fact  may be doing them as you are reading about them   Now look what you made me do  So  despite the fact that I will be giving everyone a second look for at least another couple of weeks to assess their level of delusion  I would recommend this book  Plus  I finished it in a couple of days  so it s a quick read  maybe one for the commute to work  Huh  That was interesting  3 5 star Can confirm  Is good  I mostly enjoyed reading this book  I did have a few moments where Rachel was KILLING me because she is so obsessive and awkward that I couldn t deal  However  I think the book is enjoyable for anyone who likes a good  suspenseful  whodunit type read  I figured out who did it pretty early on  but I wasn t prepared for the ending  which is so much more satisfying than Gone Girl    People have grumbled that this is  no  Gone Girl    but I ask  why does it need to be  It has plenty of merit on its own without being compared to Flynn s work  which  by the way  most people haven t actually read  they ve just seen the movie   This does have the realism and unapologetic grit of a Flynn novel  and the murder mystery element makes it all the more familiar  But in my humble opinion  Hawkins has something flynn doesn t  a way with beautiful prose  She tells the story with excellent pacing  but her descriptions of even the most mundane details  a shaft of sunlight  or a glass of wine  are exquisite  From the first page  I knew I would love this book  for the writing alone if for no other reason  Fortunately  there s more to this book than excellent prose  though  Each voice  Megan  Anna  and Rachel  is distinct and necessary  I grew to dislike all the women for their pettiness  their tendency to swallow the honeyed words of an attractive man  and their unwillingness to pick up the pieces of their lives  But I grew to love them too  Anna  for her unflinching loyalty to her family  even if it might be misplaced  Rachel  for her ultimately kind nature  and Megan  for her flawed but fragile soul  Each of the characters were relatable enough  but I felt especially bonded to Rachel  whose obsessive personality and longing for acceptance struck a chord deep within me  She reminds me of  say  myself at fifteen or so  but with the insight and scars of a grown woman  I read this book in one sitting  and I can t wait to find out what else this author has to offer  I d recommend this book to absolutely anyone   Such a great twistKeeps you on your toes the whole time  An easy read for this summer  interested to see how they interpret the movie  I m only a quarter way through  but The Girl On The Train by Paula Hawkins is about a girl named Rachel who takes a train everyday  When she s on the train she looks out the window when it goes pass this house  Rachel sees this house everyday when she s on train and watches at couple that live at the house  One day she sees something that isn t right and she tries to get involved but ends making it worse  The book is pretty slow at the beginning  but then it picks up and gets more interesting towards the middle of the book  At the beginning nothing really happens because it s mostly her on the train and day to day life  Also it doesn t really talk about the couple in the house she sees everyday on the train  What happens to the couple in the house   There is a pile of clothing on the side of the train tracks  Light blue cloth   a shirt perhaps  jumbled up with something dirty  It s probably rubbish  part of a load dumped into the scrubby little wood up the bank    Great book   each character is screwed up in a major way  If nothing  you will feel really great about your own life when you finish this book  It s being compared to Gone Girl  which is it nothing like  I guessed what would happen about half way in  It s not a huge twist but it s entertaining   This book was completely insane   There were so many twists and turns and the characters were all demented   Lol  I had a hard time putting it down    I found THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN to be an interesting choice  I thought the premise was different and it moved along quite easily  Poor Rachel  the girl on the train  is having a hard time coping with her everyday life  Her marriage fell apart  she began drinking and she also lost her job all within a short amount of time  She decides to kind of hide what her life has become by still taking the train into London to appear to still be going to her job  As she does  the route takes her right by her old place where her ex husband still lives with his current wife  At the same time  she also notices another couple just a few doors away that she decides to weave a perfect story around until one day she sees the unthinkable to her  Rachel sees the girl she perceives as the  perfect wife  having an affair with someone else  This woman shortly also disappears and is found dead  Rachel decides to put herself smack dab in the middle of the mess to try to figure out what really happened  Neither the police  nor anyone else involved sees her as a credible witness due to her drinking and lying about her life  I actually came to feel very sorry for Rachel while at the same time wanting her to just grow up  Thankfully  she does redeem herself at the end of the tale  but during the story you are almost not surprised that one thing after another does not go her way There is enough foreshadowing about 2 3 through the book for everyone to figure out who murdered Megan   the perfect wife    With that being said  it is still a satisfying ending with a lot of added intrigue and details not previously revealed  All in all  a good read I think ost will really like  ik vond dit boek echt ontzettend goed  Er zijn weinig thrillers die ik goed vind  zoals het meisje in de trein  Ik had de clue ook niet verwacht  Een geweldig boek om in je boekenkast te hebben     Meu deus  Este livro tirou me o folego Fiquei surpreendida  Nao estava mesmo nada a espera deste desfecho  Gostei imenso  4     This was a fast paced fun read  It is part mystery  part thriller and part psychological drama  There are three narrators and all of them are untrustworthy  The book deals with their  issues  and how their lives become intertwined  I recommend it  Dark and twisty turns  A modern who  dunnit with such an easy start that the end rattles  A shout out for a female  alcoholic protagonist  It s easy to write angry  man chasing  or shallow females  but another to create depth with such flaws  I resented the main character   Rachel   right up until the end  when the author brilliantly shifted my entire perspective on her mental health and reality  I couldn t help but get involved in the nuances of everybody s lives in the book   a masterful statement about how our collective behavior  and voyeuristic nature  has evolved in modern times   4 5 starsPeople watching is a pastime that most people indulge in on their daily commute  When you see the same faces every day it s easy to imagine what their lives might be like Rachel s train stops outside the same row of houses every day and so a couple who live at one of the houses who Rachel has named  Jason and Jess  have come to feel familiar to her as she watches them live their lives for a couple of minutes each day Then one day Rachel witnesses Jess kissing somebody who isn t Jason and when she sees Jess   whose real name is Megan  is missing in the news the life that she s observed for so long collides with her own as she becomes obsessed with unravelling the mystery It becomes apparent early on in the book that Rachel is an unstable character  In the last two years her marriage has broken down after her ex husbands affair  she s had to leave her beloved home and she s been fired  all the while becoming more and more dependent on alcohol to get through each day  She uses the mystery surrounding Megan s disappearance as a distraction from her own life and the lengths she ll go to to be involved are certainly unhinged I think that a lot of people who pick this book up will find Rachel unlikeable but I was sympathetic towards her situation and found her such a compelling character to read about  The fact that she often experiences blackouts in her memory when she s been drinking made her a very unreliable character who kept me guessing I have to admit that I did see where the book was going when I was about half way in but there was also a lot of new information uncovered throughout the book that made me question myself  I really struggled to put this book down because I had to know if I was right Overall The Girl on the Train was a well written and original thriller that I think would translate beautifully to the big screen  With the age old moral of never knowing what goes on behind closed doors it also shines a chilling light on the fact that we never really know those closest to us either  At first  I really did not like this book  I had a hard time relating to the main character  Rachel  I honestly did not care about her at all  which is not good when she is the main character of the story  However  about a third of the way through the book  I became more interested in the story and the characters  You learn more about why Rachel is the way she is  and you start to empathize for her  You also start to see the story unwind and see how all the characters are apart of the story  I thought the writing was excellent in the book  and I also liked how the story was presented  I also liked the ending of the book  I felt that there were hints early on in the story about a certain storyline  and I was glad that it actually happened   Overall  I liked this book a lot in the end  I also liked it more than Gone Girl  which is a book that this one is heavily compared to  Great book  If you liked Gone Girl  this is definitely a good book for you  I love psychological thrillers like this  I was constantly on my toes and did not expect the ending at all  Def a MUST READ  Holy crap    what an amazing thriller I feel like  as an avid reader  I can guess who the murderer is or at very least the suspect  but until the characters started to know  I was clueless  The entire book kept me interested  but the last 100 had my complete attention  4 stars because I wish I could say that I liked ANY of the characters in the book  but I didn t    I started to like Rachel at the very end  but it wasn t enough  I think I more  felt for her   Definitely worth the read and I m looking forward now  to the movie  Se me hizo muy pero muy atrapante  no podia soltarlo  Me lei la mitad en un vuelo de ida y la otra mitad en el de vuelta  Le pongo 4 estrellas y no 5 porque no me termina de convencer el final  si bien la autora cierra la historia me dejo con ganas de mas  Not as good as I was hoping  although I could not put it down  I love books with unreliable narrators  Not only do I have the main plot to enjoy  but I also have the puzzle of which part of the narration is true  Imagine my delight on finding a book with three narrators  all unreliable  The Girl on the Train is told by Rachel  Anna  and Megan  Rachel is the lead narrator  if you will  She takes the train into and out of London everyday  It goes by the houses of Anna and Megan slowly enough that Racel often sees Megan and her husband  She doesn t know Megan so she makes up stories about their life together  Anna is married to Tom  Rachel s ex husband  who lives in the house that Tom and Rachel lived in As Rachel continues her narration we learn that she drinks heavily and is having some trouble coming to terms with her divorce  When she sees Megan with another man she is disappointed  The next day Megan goes missing and Rachel feels the need to tell the police and Megan s husband about seeing the strange man  Her drinking makes this problematic as the police don t believe her  and she was in the neighborhood the night of the disappearence but doesn t remember anything from that night When Anna takes over the narration  we learn that she is feeling harrased by Rachel because Rachel calls often and intrudes on her new life with Tom and their baby  Anna  though  has her own agenda  She had an affair withTom while he was still married to Rachel  Megan s narration starts about a year earlier than the rest of the book and describes the problems she is having with her life and marriage   not the perfect marriage that Rachel had invisioned  nor the perfect life As the three lines of narration wend their way through the story  you realize that not everything is at it seems  As a reader  you feel sympathy for first one  then the other  They are all deeply flawed people  trying to find their ways out of situations  some of which are their own making And then there are the men  Tom  Scott  and the therapist that first Megan  then Rachel  sees  Any of the characters could have caused Megan s disappearance  Everyone has skeletons in their respective closets  which make the book very interesting  It has been compared to Gone Girl quite a bit  partly because of the husband wife dynamics and partly because of the twist at the end  but the twist wasn t as unexpected as in Gone Girl  and in the end  it wasn t as dark  This is not a book with a hero in it  and at one point I didn t like any of the characters  but there is character growth  Definitely a good mystery  4 and a half if I could  The holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mould yourself through the gaps  What was it that people used to say    Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned  I love it when girls roll up their sleeves and go on a rampage  killing everyone in their way  stilettos digging through the necks of their lying and cheating boyfriends or husbands  If some girl were to ask me what to do if she finds out that her boyfriend or husband is cheating on her  I would say  without batting an eyelid    Go Amy Dunne on him   But you know  we rarely read about characters like that  It s often girl versus girl with the boy watching from a distance  clearly amused by the ongoing catfight  Whenever I read novels about women  the unconventional types  those that are flawed or broken in some way  I would always feel bad if I see some form of jealousy among them   between mother and child  for instance  or between sisters  and more often  between wives and mistresses  I feel bad because women are often represented in a bad light  like they re always out to scratch each other s faces or drag each other down     where s the girl power ladies  And to think some of those reasons are always petty  ridiculous even  This reminds me of that classic story about the Trojan war which started with oafish Paris using the muscle between his legs to decide which goddess   Hera  Athena  or Aphrodite  deserved the title  fairest   And the rest  as they say  is history  The rest meaning that bloody war to get Helen back to Greece  Thinking about it now  I can t help but roll my eyes about the whole shallowness of it   these women   goddesses   fighting over that silly title  and Aphrodite getting Paris and  married    Helen together  not realizing the disastrous outcome of her actions  I mean  it s the old times for God s sakes  everybody s so hotheaded it s either a spear down your throat or up your ass  So you see  as a woman  I don t like reading about pettiness and women fighting over things  Therefore  this novel felt a bit slippery for me  like my other hand s on the cover of my e reader ready to slap the cover down should I decide I ve had enough of this silliness  The thing is though  I stayed until the end   It was that good  There are three unreliable narrators of the story   Rachel  Megan  and Anna  They are  by all means  unlikeable characters  Rachel is a needy  clingy  alcoholic who can t and doesn t want to move on from her divorce  Megan a lying and hysterical cheat  and Anna  a delusional and judgemental paranoid  Go on  take your pick  I won t deny that it was also a hard read  many times I d find myself grunting in annoyance or exasperation  especially when I read Rachel s parts which dominated about 60  of the narrative  However  no matter how fucked up they all are  these are realistic portrayals  I can think of one or two real people who are their own Rachels  Megans  and Annas  Their stories will converge at some point   it was an evenly paced  if somewhat too fast  mystery thriller  and it s a guaranteed guessing game till the end  As I ve said  the characters are unreliable narrators  and there s this deceptive way of concealing significant events on Rachel s end because she has this habit of  blacking out  whenever she s in alcoholic stupor  Trust me  she ll be as frustrated as you are attempting to piece the events together  Personally  I liked the holding back  it gives more room for speculation like any typical mystery thriller novel should do  except Hawkins also succeeded in keeping her characters well rounded  even the men who are equally fucked up    the scenarios in my head were just endless  Definitely an engaging ride from start to end  I loved every bit of it  and loved hated all the three women Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned Boys  you have no idea   I picked this book up just because it s a suspenseful mystery    well at least that s what we people say  I see it on goodreads a lot  A LOT Rachel takes the train every morning  She sees this perfectly married couple  Jess and Jason  But then one day  she doesn t  She sees the news and find that the wife  Jess  is missing  The night Jess went missing is the same night she seem to forget everything that happened then  She feels that she saw something important that night but then she s not sure When other readers said this is suspenseful  I see now what they mean  It s got a really thrilling pace which changes from one point of view to another  Furthermore  the time between point of views are different  Two point of views  Rachel s and Anna s  are set in present  while Megan s is set from the past  The difference of the POVs and their time frame really adds up to the intriguing side of the story  As I read through  I always check out the dates  especially Megan s  and try to see how things will connect Rachel is such an unreliable heroine  She mainly tells the story  She s a drunkard and would occasionally pass out and forget what happens  She fails to remember events and sometimes mixed them all together  Her narration is both thrilling and made me think twice about the culprit  In fact  I never really guessed who the culprit is  but I m thinking people who ve read Gone Girl would have guessed it since it s the book which this is compared to  The ending was totally heart stopping  I had to read it in one go  I can t put it down not because I still have no idea who the culprit is but once everything started making sense  everything just started going faster than usual and it was crazy  I like how exciting the climax is and how everything was perfectly put together OVERALL  The Girl on the Train is a fast paced thriller  I was immediately absorbed into its intriguing mystery with a climax that s really difficult to put down  It s got an unreliable heroine who decided to put herself in the middle of things  It s a recommended read for people who enjoys thriller mysteries  Es verdad que la historia te atrapa y no te suelta en un segundo  Lei el libro en un dia  por mas que no sea algo totalmente nuevo  confieso que no podia parar de leerlo  Great story  The character development and twists had me hooked so quickly that I couldn t put it down  even if all of them were completely rotten people  One of the best for me so far this year  4  Loved reading this book     first one in a while that I truly did not want to put down  I love the way it is written with multiple narrators and jumping back and forth from morning to evening  I figured the whole book out on page 230  I had been cooking a different theory from pretty early on  but once I had that moment of clarity  I could see exactly where it was going and even what clues I missed  Definitely happy with this book club choice  I had to really feel sorry for Rachel  alcoholic  jobless  divorced living in a room of a  friend  who feels sorry for her  She is so alone  Her husband Tom dumped her for Anna and they had a baby  Anna and Tom are living in Rachel and Tom s old home  Rachel pretends to go to work each day and the train goes by her old home  She also checks out a home a few doors down and sees a couple that she invents a story around  She sees the woman  Megan  with another man and she is determined to tell the husband  But she is so drunk by the time she gets to the station and has a black out  The woman is reported missing and Rachel gets involved with the woman s husband  Scott  and the woman s therapist thinking she is helping out and trying to figure out what happened to Megan  Megan is found dead  The story is told in the voices of the women  Megan  Anna  and Megan  Hawkins makes the references to the men in Megan s story a little ambiguous so that you really don t know who her lover is  but I figured it out about 1 3 of the way through  Good story  quick read  Un tres bon polar  original avec l histoire du train et qui arrive a nous plonger dans une ambiance angoissante et depressive  Le personnage de Rachel est tellement nevrosee et obsessionnelle qu on a tantot envie de la detester que de l aimer car elle en rajoute toujours une couche alors on a envie de lui dire  Stop   mais elle a quand meme un bon fond Sinon avec ce livre on se rend bien compte que les apparences sont trompeuses et qu on ne sait jamais comment ca se passe au sein d un couple  LOVED this book  The only problem was the drinking problem in the book  I wanted Rach to be well   what the hell the end    I didn t expect this I know I know    I am no longer just the girl in the train  going back and forth without point or purpose    If you are going to read this book  be prepared  This book is not the book where you ll find the characters were safe at their homes and will find their happily ever after  So  I suggest you to read this in the sunlight  if possible with lots of people swarming around you The most interesting thing about this book is that  you cannot trust anyone in this book  Each character in this book was a wreck  After all  as quoted from Emily s review     between an alcoholic  a liar  and a cheat  who could you trust  I think Paula Hawkins did a really great job about the characterization too  because as wrecked as they are  I still felt a thousand of emotions from pity  sympathy  disgust  tolerance  and so much more in each character and that s just a whole new experience for me  Train spottingVor einigen Jahren wurde die etwas uber 30jahrige Rachel geschieden  Weil sie wahrend der Arbeitszeit getrunken hat und ausfallig geworden ist  hat sie ihren Job verloren  Eine eigene Wohnung kann sie sich nicht leisten  doch ihrer Vermieterin und Freundin hat sie nicht einmal erzahlt  dass sie arbeitslos ist  Jeden Morgen besteigt sie den Zug nach London  den der mitten auf der Strecke halt  in der Nahe ihres alten Hauses  Doch nicht nur dieses beobachtet Rachel  Ein paar Hauser weiter lebt ein junges Paar  das ihre Phantasie anregt  Sie malt sich aus  welch ein gluckliches Leben die beiden fuhren  gibt ihnen Namen  wunscht sich  sie wurde selbst ein gluckliches Leben fuhren und nicht von einem Alkoholrausch zum Nachsten stolpern  Doch dann verschwindet die junge Frau Nicht gerade sehr sympathisch wirkt die Alkoholikerin Rachel  die ihre Tage mit dem Gedanken an das  was verloren ist vertut  anstatt sich etwas Neuem zuzuwenden  Mit einigem Widerwillen liest man die Zeilen uber ihr Gejammer  ihre Vergangenheitsbezogenheit  ihre alkoholgeschwangerten Ergusse  Warum schliesst sie nicht mit der Vergangenheit ab  mit ihrem Ex Mann Tom  der doch offensichtlich nichts mehr mit ihr zu tun haben will  Er hat schliesslich eine neue Frau und ein Kind  Nur nach und nach gehen einem einige der Hintergrunde auf  die mit dazu beigetragen haben  dass aus Rachel die wurde  die ohne Ziel und Zweck mit dem Zug fahrt  Erinnerungslucken  schlechte Traume und doch das Gefuhl  etwas beitragen zu mussen  fuhren Rachel zur Polizei  wo jedoch schnell erkannt wird  wie wenig glaubhaft sie als Zeugin ist So wie die Handlung nur langsam voranschreitet  so langsam geht einem als Leser auf  was mit Rachel geschehen ist  Und so wie Rachel nicht nur die Person ist  die sie am Anfang zu sein scheint  treiben auch die meisten anderen handelnden Personen ihre verborgenen Spiele  Mit jedem Wechsel der Perspektive erfahrt der Leser eine neue Facette dieser sich langsam zum Thriller entwickelnden Geschichte  Mit fast unheimlicher Anspannung verfolgt man den Gang der Ereignisse  spurt die unbekannte Gefahr hinter jeden Ecke lauern  Ein psychologischer Spannungsroman  der einen nach und nach packt und schliesslich nicht mehr loslasst   I am one of the few people I know who enjoyed this book  I thought it was creepy and I always love a mystery in the summer when I m ready to read some lighter books  I thought the protagonist s struggle with alcoholism was disturbing but made the book intriguing  I would not hold high expectations or this book or attempt to analyze it too much or you may be disappointed   A gripping read   couldn t put this down  I couldn t put this book down     a great read during  Dive Week  on Cayman Brac  I kept trying to figure out the  who dunnit  while wondering which one of the main male and female characters was more psycho than the others  It was so interesting to see how their lives intertwined in this suspenseful story  Rachel is the Girl on the Train  during her daily commute in and out of London she observes the scenery out of the window  she knows it inside out   the discarded rubbish at the side of the tracks  the back gardens of the houses along the way   she misses nothing  She has even invented an idyllic life for a couple she sees regularly  One day she notices something which upsets her and sets in motion a train of events which will turn her life upside down Rachel s life is a mess  a divorcee who has great difficulty accepting her ex husband s new life  an alcoholic  often in a state of inebriation or lusting after her next drink  Having lost her job she continues her daily commute  not admitting to her friend  also her landlady  that she has no job  She is lonely and bitter and thoroughly unlikeable  and yet   and yet  this did not prevent me from reading this and marvelling at just how stupid she could be  She just cannot leave things alone and has a desperate need to be involved in the drama that unfolds  regardless of the consequences  Unlikeable or unsympathetic characters are usually a turn off  but in this instance the very fact that Rachel is so flawed works really well The story is told in present tense mainly from Rachel s viewpoint  but with input from the other two main characters   Megan and Anna  Although well written and pacey  I found the actual structure   the different time lines  which actually span only just over a year or so   extremely confusing and had to keep flipping back to find out where I was  Although I had sussed this out well before the end  but then I do read a lot of this genre   it is clever  tense  with occasional touches of black humour and a good balance of character and plot  Paula Hawkins is definitely an author to watch  My thanks to Amazon Vine for a free copy to review  Following the trend of books with unlikable and or unreliable narrators  GIRL ON A TRAIN introduces us to three women whose lives are entangled in a web of lies and deceit involving each other  While all of the characters in this book behave despicably  I couldn t help but keep reading to see what happens to them  The plot started slow  but soon kicked into high speed  much like the train Rachel rides every day  It was fascinating to watch the web of lies untangle and learn the truth of what happened  I didn t care for any of the characters any better by the end  but was satisfied with how everything was tied up  I enjoyed this read  it was very interesting and intense but I feel like the main reason I didn t LOVED the book was because of my expectations being way too high  Anyway    This book made me think a lot and it changed my perspective in a lot of things  which I appreciate    I did not read this book because of all the comparisons to Gone Girl  a book I thoroughly enjoyed  I did not want to read a half ass attempt at a Gone Girl redux  and with  girl  in the title  I decided not to read it  Then  I was at my local bookstore  and one of the owners confessed he had given the book a try and really enjoyed it  I could find nothing else on the shelves that interested me  and my friend  Michelle  was reading the book as well  so I bought it  It s a good page turner  with some very accurate depictions of an emotional abuse victim  how she is viewed by others  weak  possibly deranged   and how the abuser is viewed  charming  credible   It s a fast read  and a lot of the plot points are predictable  but still a good book  Obzirom na vise losih od dobrih ocjena ove knjige koje sam cula  bila sam spremna na najgore  Pokazalo se ipak da meni ovo nije ni tako losa knjiga  zaplet je odlican  a roman se cita brzo ocekujuci rasplet  zapravo mogu reci da je ovo izvrstan predlozak za film  Glavna junakinja  djevojka iz voza  Rejcel i pored svojih slobosti me nije nervirala  cak mi je bila simpaticna i navijala sam za nju    Knjiga ima tacno onoliko stranica koliko ovakva tema i zasluzuje  sve vise od ovoga bi postalo zamorno jer u ovom zanru kraj je ono sto se zapravo nestrpljivo ocekuje  Podsjetila me na Plazu ruzinih latica D  Koomson koja ima nesto bolje razradenu pricu  ali za tu temu previse stranica pa onda i postane zamorna    Marketing oko ove knjige je odraden savrseno  postala je fenomen sto mislim da ipak bas i ne zasluzuje  ali radi se o solidnoj triler drami kojoj dajem 4  In a world full of pink stories I appreciate this kind of books  where all characters are just humans  full of imperfections and sometimes despicable    Rachel it s a character you feel sorry for or you just hate her  I m not gonna say the ending was a surprise  at the middle of the book I kind of knew  but I liked it anyway  I couldn t stop reading  I m so sorry for people who didn t get the book at all  Maybe they were expecting a full thriller and I think The Girl On The Train is more about human emotions  Favorite Quote  The holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mould yourself through the gaps   Song for the book link  Massive Attack  AngelFavorite Character None _____________________________________En un mundo lleno de historias rosas aprecio este tipo de libros  donde todos los personajes son solo seres humanos  llenos de imperfecciones y a veces despreciables     Rachel es un personaje que o sientes lastima por ella o simplemente la odias No voy a decir que el final fue una sorpresa  en la mitad del libro yo como que ya lo sabia  pero me gusto de todos modos No podia dejar de leer  Lo siento por las personas que no entendieron el libro en absoluto  Tal vez ellos estaban esperando un thriller a full y creo que LA Chica del Tren es mas sobre las emociones humanas Frase Favorita  Los vacios en tu vida son permanentes  Tienes que crecer alrededor de ellos  como las raices de los arboles alrededor del hormigon  buscando tu espacio a traves de las brechas   Cancion para el libro link  Massive Attack  AngelPersonaje Favorito Ninguno  Kept me turning the pages  I liked how the narrative switched from the different character s point of view and also enjoyed the British phrasing  Well written and a good however not surprising ending  A good read that holds your attention for sure  This book should aptly be called  Drunk Girl on Train  Crime Solver Edition  I ve never seen the mechanism of drunkenness used for the slow reveal of  who dunnit    It s brilliant  in a way  Without giving too much away  one girl is a messed up drunk  another girl is a messed up housewife  another girl  well  we don t know too much of her present  just some messed up  dark issues of her past  The book starts with a mysterious burial of a body and then later reveals a person gone missing  The comparisons to GONE GIRL are not without merit I m going to judge this book on  are we there yet   moments versus  Holy Crap    moments  That s what we expect from a GONE GIRL like book  right  That made into a movie book had back and forth narratives that twisted us around  shocked us  and left us begging to know what was going to happen  Until the crappy ending  please don t disappoint us again  Gillian Flynn   Yes  I ll judge this hopetfully future movie book on the ending  too  Just hang on The first few chapters have that  Holy Crap    build up  First the dedication to the buried body  then the crazy girl with issues on the train  ripping Band Aids off her skin  digging nails into her wounds  Initial impression  this book is going to be CRAY zy  Not quite  At least not from cover to cover As the narratives flip back and forth and the fog of blacked out drunkness begin to lift around 200 pages into it  you begin to wonder   are we there yet   Characters are developed in a solid manner  but you wonder if they are withholding information  That s irksome  If a book doesn t have a lot of action or twists  then tell us what s happening  Such a tease But I have to say  almost all is forgiven in the last several chapters of the book  Things get intense  Again  no spoilers here  Maybe those apparent lulls were a sign of skillful writing  it was all anticipation and build up  And unlike GONE GIRL  I was actually satisfied with the ending  Kickass girls FTW    For the win  This book is a page turner that is great for the summer beaches  It has more  Holy Crap    than  are we there yet   moments  in my opinion  that equals a net gain  What a remarkable book this was  There was so much thrill and action at the end  So many plot twists and affairs This book only got four stars because 1  I do not like Tom and what he orginally did to Rachel  2  I did not like Anna up until the very end because of the thrill she had while Tom was still with Rachel  But that s how life is  We get ourselves entangled with those whom we think we know but in return are a completely different person  I recomend this book to anyone whom enjoys thrillersand the novel Gone Girl   Even though I still haven t read it oops  It was one of the reviews on the dust jacket lol   Escribo este  review  casi exactamente una semana despues que acabe el libro  a veces la vida misma se interpone en las cosas que uno suele hacer de inmediato  pero bueno Disfrute de un 40  del libro el formato de audio  audible  y lei el otro 60 The Girl on the Train cuenta la historia de un grupo de personas  narrada desde el punto de vista de tres mujeres  Rachel  Megan y Anna  Diversas circunstancias logran que las vidas de estas mujeres se entrelacen Dificil tejer una sinopsis sin soltar muchos detalles   Empieza un poco lento  pero no aburre  Abre con monologos de dos de los personajes mas importantes  Historias de fondo  pensamientos y demas  Rachel es alcoholica y tiende a ocultar muchas cosas  Megan tiene sus propios problemas  es inestable y no se considera feliz  Anna aparenta ser una mujer perfecta con una vida perfecta  el esposo perfecto y la pequena hija perfecta Es un libro sumamente facil de leer  con una escritura simple pero exquisita a la vez  muy madura y con una premisa atractiva  Definitivamente no parece el primer intento de una autora Comparan la novela con  Gone Girl  de Gillian Flynn y sobre eso puedo decir que  al igual que Flynn  Hawkins traza a personajes femeninos complejos  multidimensionales y ricos en detalles pero  a diferencia de Flynn que tambien crea personajes masculinos con igual complejidad  Hawkins peca de presentarnos a sus personajes masculinos como muchas autoras inexpertas  en imagen  perfectos  en expresion  teatrales  en fondo  vacios Otro defecto que tiene el libro es que resulta bastante predecible  aun asi  la escritura  la perspectiva de los personajes y el desarrollo mismo del libro te hacen apretar el pedal aun creas conocer lo que va pasando Con apenas 336 paginas de extension y con largas tandas de lectura garantizadas  The Girl on the Train se lee bastante rapido y se disfruta plenamente a pesar de sus aisladas deficiencias La autora cita a Agatha Christie  Donna Tartt  Kate Atkinson  Tana French y  por supuesto  a Gillian Flynn como sus autoras favoritas e inspiraciones para su escritura en el genero de thriller y suspenso  Un listado que se debe de tener presente a la hora de comparar y recomendar la novela de Paula Hawkins Definitivamente leeria un proximo libro de ella  When I commuted in Paris  I took the Metro  The majority of the lines run underground  but a few of them have sections that burst out into sunlight  I didn t have a set schedule of lines to take  a few different routes would get me to the same place  If I wanted  I could walk to the 11 and ride it all the way down the hill from which Belleville and Menilmontant gaze upon the heart of Paris  The cars on the 11  the brown line  a rather fecal brown  alas  were a bit rattletrap  and so when gravity shot the train down the hill  everything jumbled around and it was mildly exhilarating  as much as a commute headlong rush down an underground can be exhilarating  Sometimes I worried the brakes would fail  Then I practiced my Gallic shrug and got on with life Line 5  on which my stop was situated  crosses the Seine  and for a moment  I would see the city  Notre Dame and Ile de la Cite  the Tour Eiffel  the Tour Montparnasse  Then back into darkness again  My commute was ever changing  it was an organic thing  I never saw the same people on my trains  or if I did  I was far too busy adopting a posture of Gallic indifference to notice   Part of that experience is why The Girl on the Train s narrative grabbed me  Rachel  the titular girl  passes the same house every day on her commute into London on the  also titular  train  She often sees the inhabitants outside  and she s invented names and a whole life for them  In her mind  Jess and Jason  not their real names  these are the names Rachel s given them  are the perfect couple  and Rachel finds solace in the normalcy of their lives  Seeing her fantasy couple day after day when the train makes a stop at a light keeps Rachel grounded  It s a tenuous link to reality  as Rachel s life is  not to put too fine a point on it  a complete mess A few years ago  Rachel s husband  Tom  had an affair  He left her and had a baby with his new wife  Anna  Rachel and Tom had been trying to have a baby  but with no success  Discouraged  Rachel turned to drinking  Now  she s single  living with an acquaintance from university  fired from her job for drunkenness  and slurping canned gin and tonics at every opportunity Let me take a moment to say that I had no idea one could purchase a can of G T in Great Britain  This sounds simultaneously gross and intriguing Anyway  Rachel drinks so much that she experiences total blackouts  and often gets off the train to go to her old house  Incidentally  it s in the same neighborhood as Jess  house  the one she watches every day from the train  One night  she catches the eye of a red haired chap on the train  and she s pretty sure she gets off at that stop with  the stop where her old house is  The next morning  she wakes up in bed covered in blood and in her skivvies  She has no memory of the night before  only that she walked through the underpass and    nothing  Later that day  a woman is reported missing  it s Jess  only her real name is Megan  and her husband s real name is Scott  And nothing is what Rachel thought it was Hawkins has slowly been alternating narrative point of view between Rachel and Megan  pre disappearance   and when she tosses Anna  the new wife  into the mix  it gets even cattier  Not that I think women should be catty  au contraire  Anna s supremely self centered way of thinking reminded me a bit of Amy in Gone Girl  a book to which The Girl on the Train has been compared  and rightly so  for the tautness of the writing and the unflinching look into the ugly side of human nature  which is most of it  but that s neither here nor there   Rachel does everything she can to make the reader dislike her  and yet  I found myself rooting for her  Every time she made a dumb mistake or had yet another drink  I still cared about her  And as in my review of Gone Girl  I can t divulge too much of the plot without ruining the whole thing  Hawkins creates strong characters  thick tension  and a solid setting  I did guess part of the Big Reveal about halfway through the book  but rather than being disappointed by this  I felt validated that I had picked up on the cues Hawkins gave in the narration  My only quibble would be the ending  Again  to return to Gone Girl  a lot of people I know didn t like the ending  I loved it  I thought it was perfect for the book and for the characters  In The Girl on the Train  the ending fit  but it happened too fast  I felt like I slammed into a brick wall and slowly slid down like a cartoon character  That s it  It s not an ambiguous ending  it s a short ending  and it doesn t address the issue brought up by the actions of one of the main characters slightly earlier in the book  well  that was ambiguous   If you must  click for the spoiler  view spoiler  Okay  so what s up with Scott  Megan s husband  Obviously  he is emotionally and physically abusive  but why don t we hear anything else about him after he attacks Rachel and locks her in the closet  Are we  the readers  to assume that everything will come out once Rachel is validated as a witness  And another thing  I seriously thought Tom was slipping Rachel GSB when she was having her blackouts  Somehow  that makes more sense to me than him just waiting for her to have an alcohol blackout   hide spoiler   On the whole  however  The Girl on the Train was a fantastic read and something I d recommend to pretty much anyone  I ll never think about commuting the same way  The Girl on the Train is deel van die nuwe genre   chick noir   wat  n tipe korrektief op chick lit is  Chick noir beskryf die donker kant of aftakeling van die huwelik  daar is geen happily ever after eindes of mooi pienk omslae nie  Dit speel met die idee dat jy nooit werklik iemand ken nie   ook nie die persoon wat langs jou slaap nie  Paula Hawkins het hierdie tendens goed raakgesien en verstaan  En  n stappie verder gegaan  sy ontgin meer as net die huwelik  Sy wys die donker wereld van drankmisbruik  lewer kommentaar op die voyeuristiese samelewing waarin ons leef en die grense tussen realiteit en  n  werklikheid  wat ons self skep  Sy speel met herinnering en hoe beinvloedbaar ons is   nie net in die verhaal nie  maar ook deur die leser se idee van gebeure en houding teenoor die karakters kort kort op sy kop te draai  Ek het tot reg aan die einde getwyfel aan my oordele en vermoedens  Dis wat  n mens soek by  n sielkundige riller  A mystery that will have you guessing to the very end  Told from the views of Rachel  Anna  and Megan  we get to see how different parts of the story weave together  Each person sees the situations in a different light and it makes you realize that you may not truly know someone else   Come sempre quando finisco un libro  la cosa principale che tengo in considerazione per valutare quanto mi sia piaciuto e quanto mi abbia coinvolta Esistono libri favolosi coi quali pero si fa fatica ad andare avanti  e ci sono libri dalla trama mediocre  poco articolata  dai quali pero e difficile staccarsi   La ragazza del treno  appartiene perlopiu alla seconda categoria La storia che fa da sfondo al romanzo si puo riassumere in poche parole  Rachel  disoccupata e alcolizzata  ogni giorno passa in treno davanti alla via dove prima abitava  La sua vecchia casa  la sua vecchia vita    e due nuovi vicini  Rachel li vede nel loro giardino  sembrano una coppia cosi perfetta e invidiabile  Ma un giorno vede qualcosa che non quadra  che la turba  Da qui si snoda tutto il romanzo Uno stile semplice ma una storia che cattura  A tratti mi ha ricordato l atmosfera tesa di  L amore bugiardo  ma mi ha fatto pensare anche a  Una donna di troppo   Cinematograficamente parlando fa venire in mente il bellissimo  Match point  di Woody Allen 4 5 stelle  perche quelli da 5 mi hanno dato qualcosina in piu  This hooked me from the very beginning  which is something Gone Girl didn t do  I keep seeing those two compared everywhere so I thought this was worth mentioning   It was stressful the majority of the time  so stressful that one character in particular had me ripping my hair out by the end  but ultimately satisfying I was immediately enthralled with the narrators  Their unreliability didn t frustrate me  but made me more interested in figuring out what was going on  I was especially invested in Rachel s character  She s a    potential spoiler    alcoholic  and because of this some of her actions left me embarrassed for or frustrated with her  but she was still very sympathetic to me  Megan seemed to be the most complex  although that s not to say the other characters weren t  Anna seemed very one dimensional  but she surprised me by the end  The male characters were less developed than the female ones  but that s to be expected since we don t get any insight into their minds aside from what the female characters tell us about them  There were a couple times when I was brought out of the story because what a character did thought seemed completely irrational to me    A lot of the shock value of the novel lied in the decisions the characters made  when they did things that I could never imagine doing in a million years  But their actions ultimately made sense considering their situations  These are very broken sick disturbed people who act in broken sick disturbing ways Now that I ve finished  I want to go back and look for all of the clues I didn t see right away  There s little filler here  You could  solve the mystery  if you pay close enough attention    Which is why I cried  Why didn t you see   Why didn t you notice that    to myself once things started wrapping up  If you like to solve mysteries before the characters do  this book would be for you  I should mention that I listened to the audiobook version of this  Listening to a book instead of reading it makes it a lot easier to get distracted and lose what s happening  It took me a few chapters to figure out that the narrators were speaking in different times   this wouldn t have happened if I d been reading it  This author tended to use the last sentence of chapters to add in something suspicious  telling  something to keep the reader on her toes  But I didn t have time to linger over the end of chapters like I might with a physical book  The characters voices coloured my impressions of them  I disliked Anna s voice  which immediately coloured my interpretation of her and made me dislike her more than I might have otherwise  Rachel s voice reminded me of Kate Winslet s  which might ve made me like her more  Megan s voice sounded exactly like Lady Edith Crawley from Downton Abbey  Laura Carmichael  which I loved  It gave her a slight air of snobbery which fit the character well  I know a lot of people look down on audiobooks  but I d recommend this one  It can completely change the experience you have  I went into this with little expectations and came out completely satisfied  For someone who casually reads thrillers  I thought this was really good and worth the read   listen    Suspenseful and engaging  Wanted to strangle most everyone   I could not put this down  Delicious  Loved the twists   tuns  I don t want to say anything else  but I thought it was a great read  Nicely fast paced and engaging  Interesting twists and plays out satisfyingly   Looking for a great thriller  Look no further  the train has arrived  Paula Hawkins has written a tightly woven mystery with painful secrets and startling truths reveled along the way The main character Rachael  is a heavy drinker  whose life is teetering on the edge  She has lost her husband  and her job  Yet  she continues to ride the train into the city every day  pretending to go to work  Along the way  Rachael creates a story about a perfect couple who s home backs the tracks  a home just a few houses down from where she lived with her husband Enter Megan  who s story begins one year before Rachael s  I must confess  I got a little confused with the dates interspersed throughout the story  but realized the author was using them cleverly  Meagan s story seems to move quickly forward  while Rachael s  very slowly  I thought they were a perfect analogy for two trains on different tracks  bound to converge at some point along the way  And converge they do  Megan goes missing on a day Rachael has drank herself into a black out  What has happened to Megan and what does her story have to do with not only Rachael herself  but also her fantasy story of the perfect couple  This is definitely a thriller that keep me moving quickly through the pages  I wasn t completely satisfied with the ending  but also  loved the authors ability to keep the story bound to a short list of characters  I have no doubt this will be a big hit for thriller fans  Two thirds of this book were fantastic  compelling  original  and despite my dislike of thrillers  I was intrigued  And then the last hundred pages or so went in a direction I neither expected  nor particularly cared for  Instead of taking advantage of a multitude of opportunities for originality and cleverness  Hawkins instead veers off into Clicheland  taking with her what had made the book so gripping   its unexpectedness  Also I felt that Rachel s character  whilst a captivating unreliable narrator and interesting protagonist  was sometimes too heavily based upon her alcoholism  as a substitute for actual development  Despite all this  I did enjoy this book  and it s not anything short of very good   it merely caves under the strain of perhaps being pre emptively labelled and marketed as a  thriller   and is thus unable to really come into its own without feeling like it is appeasing the expectations of an audience anticipating thrills  rather than a well written  consistently original novel    Something happened  something bad  I ll give this story a solid 4 stars Can I start off by saying I haven t read Gone Girl yet  Because I haven t  I have a vague idea of the plot and story but I haven t read it so I can t compare it to that  Which is fine by me  Who wants to have their book compared to someone else s  it should be judged on its own merit  Who is to say she hadn t been working on this book between jobs long before Gone Girl had already been published  I don t know either way  but I m just saying    So that s me with my disclaimer  can t compare it to Gone Girl  sorry  not sorry Wow  what a creepy read  This story is told from the point of view of 3 very unreliable women  The first and main one is Rachel  an alcoholic  and you spend your whole read wondering how much of what you re getting from her can be trusted since half the time she can t even reliably remember what she did  The other two women are Anna  the mistress who became the wife that took the alcoholics place  try saying that 3 times in a row  and Megan the dead woman that the story evolves around  her story is injected throughout  the moments past and present  that lead up to her death  Rachel  has idealized a couple she can see from her seat on the train that passes by their house  a couple she dubs  Jess  and  Jason   She imagines their life of beautiful wedded bliss  how happy they are together  perhaps to make up for how her own life is going down the drain since her husband left her for his mistress  and she started drinking her life away  Then the unthinkable happens  one day she witnesses something that shatters her idealized story for the couple as the train passes by Jess and Jason s home  Then  a couple days later she sees  Jess   face on a news story  a woman who is actually named Megan that has gone missing Can what Rachel saw that day help the police catch the killer or is she only going to make things worse Did I like this book  Absolutely It is everything I love about mysteries  There is intrigue and secrets within secrets and you never really know who you should be trusting    even the end leaves you with a sense of unease about how much trust anyone in this story deserves  While the story doesn t go quite as fast as I usually prefer  it was still a great book What surprised me about me liking this story was that I didn t even really care much for the narrators  I was probably more curious about Megan than anything but I really didn t care for Anna  her attitude in general really annoyed me  Rachel  while I felt slightly bad for her  also annoyed me because it was obviously time to move on from her husband  Despite feeling that about the narrators I still felt compelled to find out where the story was going to bring them in the end  While I had guessed pretty early on  about the  who  it was that did something bad  I still hadn t anticipated just how skillfully Paula Hawkins was going to weave everything together  Lovely read  I hope she writes more thrillers  she s very skilled at it and I d love to read more from her  Spoilers        I KNEW IT Sorry  I just needed to boast because I figured it all out quite early  well  not so early  but once the clues where all there  I did figure it out pretty quickly What bothered me a bit is that because of the description of the book  I expected something completely different  The title itself is not misleading  but the description is  Because never ever would I have thought that the girl on the train IS the protagonist  So that was a bit irritating first and somehow it disappointed me  because like I said  I was expeting something else   Another thing that I did not like is the fact that Rachel and Megan were way too similar  Whenever I read from Anna s POV  it was crystal clear  But I could not distinguish between Rachel and Megan  if you ignore the context    I felt like there was no real difference between them Furthermore  I was a bit angry sometimes that many of these women were so weak and depressed  but I guess that s really common in adult books  And somehow it was understandable What I LOVED is the mind games  The suspect is constantly changing  Whenever Rachel thinks about who the killer is  there is always a motive somewhere nearby to back her theory up  Paula Hawkin s did a great job when it comes to the core question of the book  There were some moments that I thought were going to be unnecessary  like the scene where Rachel dreamt about Scott choking Megan  and I was thinking  why would that be important  Why does Rachel dream something like that if it turns out to be a lie   Because if those scenes were put into the story just to irritate the reader  I would critize them  but all those dreams that Rachel had acutally made sense in the end Rachel I felt sorry for Rachel  At first  I was constantly thinking JUST PULL YOURSELF TOGEHTER  But  after all those secrets had come out and I realized what was done to her  I felt sorry for her because she was so convinced and believed everything Tom has told her  And what I really liked in this book is the step by step realization  When Rachel had the feeling that what Tom said about what she had done  embarrassing him  hitting him etc  did not feel like her at all  That she did not feel sorry for those actions because she can not really remember them  It was done so slowly and slightly  so the reader could really see this realization dawning on Rachel Anna The writing style used whenever Anna was thinking acting etc  fits the character  If you for example think about that moment or actually  the moments  when Anna sees Rachel  she always says thinks that Rachel is grinning at her and that she has this suspicious  evil smile on her face  But when the story switches to Rachel s POV  you actually see that Rachel is shocked to be caught and has no bad intention  And this proves or shows how much Anna hates Rachel and why she interprets her behaviour that way I was very unsure of Anna  I didn t know whether I could trust her  heck I even suspected her  Especially towards the end of the book  I had some grave doubts and actually feared that the story might not end quite so well for Rachel  because I honestly thought Anna was so naive and believes Tom Scott I always suspected that the way Rachel sees Scott can never be accurate and that there is much more to him than one might think  though especially towards the end of the story I was convinced that he can not be the killer for these two reasons  1  it would be too obvious  2  he loved Megan  Because despite of him being really jealous  a controll freak and even being abusive  he could not have killed Megan Tom I did not like Tom from the very beginning  I just did not trust him one single bit  Turns out I was right about him  What I noticed immediately is how differently he behaved  depending on whom he was with  Whenever he was with Anna  he was talking so badly about Rachel  and in fact  he sometimes said things that were a bit too much for only wanting to calm Anna  And when he was with Rachel  HE DEFINITELY LEAD HER ON  And that made me really mad  because I realized that he is manipulative  And when it actually came out that he is so much more than that  namely a psychopath  I wasn t really surprised The sad thing though is that people like him exist  Tom knew EXACTLY what to tell Rachel Anna Megan  he knew what they needed to hear and he knew how to say it so that they would believe him  And all those women did not really know who he really is  and if you are in need of a certain person and Tom turns out to be this certain person in this certain situation  or more accurately  pretends to be this person   then of course you trust him And this is what made this story so incredibly good  you could understand every person in this book and you can t really blame any of these characters for trusting Tom or for example blame Anna for hating Rachel  All those people were played with  they ended up broken and confused  it was really difficult to get clarity into their minds which made them so fragile And I also loved the fact that this perfect picture Rachel had of  Jason and Jesse   this perfect couple  turned out to be so far from that and was just a big fat lie illusion This book made me turn pages like there is no tomorrow  And except for the misleading expectations it creates and the lacking of difference in the writing style for the different POVs  there is nothing I can criticize  It was billed as Gone Girl esque and did not disappoint  I was in the mood for a psychological thriller and this fed my appetite for a thrilling read with irredeemable characters  One of the main characters in an alcoholic mess and another is a damaged girl that loves to get validation through cheating  I like reading a story through the eyes of flawed characters  even if I can t relate to them personally  It makes it fun   Maybe not quite worth all the hype but still a solid read   There s always a risk an author takes when writing a story with an unreliable narrator  and Rachel Watson  the main of three narrators of the Girl on the Train is as unreliable as they come  She s an alcoholic and is subject to drink induced blackouts that are a major part of the plot of The Girl on the Train  Having an alcoholic unreliable narrator tell the majority of a story is a sure fire invitation to fall into cliche and produce a stereotypical character  After all  we ve seen these sorts of stories before  the film The Lost Weekend being probably the greatest of these  But in her first novel  Paula Hawkins manages to create a very flawed and human character  When Rachel Watson  the eponymous Girl on the Train sees people from the windows of the train she rides religiously every morning at 8 04 AM in an attempt to fool her flatmate into thinking she still has a job  she daydreams about those she sees on the train  She fantasizes that those she observes have perfect lives that she herself cannot obtain  so these fantasies will have to do  I felt like it was a very human thing to do  who hasn t filled in the back story for some stranger they take a fancy to out on the street  Imagining is a very human thing to do  especially when trying to avoid pain and loss The story was very compelling  I managed to read this book in a 24 hour period  which is something I rarely do  There are flaws  I wasn t keen on the extra narrators  but they were essential to getting the whole story  Unfortunately  if Hawkins lets us know early on who narrator Megan is talking about  the tension and suspense of the novel would probably get blown  As it is  it s easy to figure out before the big reveal  But in this story the characters shine and it s a fantastic first effort  Slow startSlow start but over all it was a good read  Didn t like the whiney spells but great twist in the end never thought was coming   4 5 starsEroteljes hangulat rogton az elejetol  amitol meg jo sokaig nem tudok majd

thriller som stegras alltmer mot slutet  Det finns mycket jag uppskattar med denna bok   bland annat de tre perspektiv en far folja  vilka nyanserar handelseforloppet pa ett fint och spannande satt  4 1 2 out of 5  This book has been called  Hitchcockian  and it is an apt description  I can easily see it as a Hitchcock movie  I can say this without spoiling anything  Rachel is the queen of all unreliable narrators  She s a hopeless alcoholic who has destroyed her life  Her husband has left her for another woman  She s been fired from her job  She s a hair s breadth away from getting kicked out of her lodging  She has blackouts where she does embarrassing things  or so she s told  to the point where she starts almost every conversation with  I m sorry  I m so sorry   Believe me  she says that a lot When she becomes involved in the investigation disappearance of woman she had seen while commuting to the job she no longer had  Rachel begins to show how obsessive a character she really is  She lies and connives her way into the investigation and into the lives of people who very well could be a murderer  How else can such a situation end but badly For much of the book I was repelled by Rachel  Her mendacity  obsessive nature  and weakness of character got her mixed up in the case and also make it hard to feel sympathetic towards her  What is compelling  though  is the question of what happened during her blackout on the night of the disappearance  Was she involved in Megan s disappearance  Was she a witness  These are all elements a classic Hitchcockian thriller    I listened to the audio version downloaded from the library  While narrator Clare Corbett did a good job in her portrayal of Rachel  Anna and Megan  more attention could have been paid to her diction and the recording in general was muffled and indistinct  This book was so twisted   I loved it  You never knew who s perspective was real  thence the suspense  The thrill  It was surprisingly over the top  equalling one wicked train ride  I gave it 3 5 out 5 stars  This was an exciting story  Began a little slow but once it got going  hard to put down  The point of view shifted among three women  The time period kept shifting as well  I found it a little hard to follow until I glanced back to prior chapters to compare time periods  If it was the intent of the author to make the reader feel as confused as Rachel often was  she succeeded with this reader  I disliked most of the characters in the book  Rachel  Megan  Anna  Tom  Scott  and detective Riley  What a cast of messed up people  I felt like the author carefully laid out their faults which evoked some strong feelings in me  I found myself shifting from thinking how I would like to tell the different characters    you are incredibly naive  get a grip on reality  you deserve this  he s abusing you  stay out of it  no wonder no one believes you  etc  Even though I did not like the characters  the author deserves four stars for evoking such strong reactions   It s a lively Saturday morning  I am downtown  I am noticing  like many others  the things going around me  The people talking  the cars moving  light fall wind against their faces  Unlike everyone else  I am doing something they aren t  Every action I see  I think about what it has taken for that to happen  A man walks out with a coffee  Maybe he just got out of poverty and is getting his life together  and this is the first coffee he could afford in a long time  Then  a car speeds down the road  Maybe that driver just lost a family member in an accident  But not long ago  I didn t think like that  I noticed everything  but then it left me  and I never thought about it again  like most people  Surprisingly enough  it was a book that changed the way I thought The simple act of reading  The Girl on The Train  is what did it  This book is probably one of the most influential books I have ever read  It s ability to incorporate many good parts of a writer into one work is truly amazing  The plot was thrilling and on task  the writing craft was superb  and especially what the author did with character development blew my mind  These are some of the biggest parts that really stand out in this book to me  First off  the plot in  The Girl on the Train  is unique and well written  In the exposition  it s not some massive life changing scene that sets off the rising action  Take a look at this passage   He s a cousin from Australia  staying for a couple weeks  he s Jason s oldest friend  best man at their wedding  Jess walks towards him  she puts her hand around her waist and kisses him  long and deep  The train moves   You probably won t believe it  but that s the exposition  Yep  that s it  Even with that as an exposition  the book is one of the most thrilling plots I have ever read  even more so than the ones with the massive exposition  That short  but powerful and simple passage sets of a whirlwind of action and thrill that ends in an breathtaking double murder  plot twist ending  That simple start to an amazing book I think Paula Hawkins  greatest part of this book was the character development  It may seem cliche to most readers  but I noticed something special about it  Like any good author  she is able to let the reader really understand the character  We are able to understand Rachael very well  But  what Hawkins does after that  is quite interesting  Most good readers can predict what a character will do  once they know them  but in  The Girl on the Train   it is really hard to predict what will happen next  I find this to be a very good trait about this book because it is unlike the others and adds a new level of suspense to it because we can never anticipate the next move of a character Finally  the plot in this book is also amazingly unique  While having subtle plot parts  like the exposition  it also isn t like most others books  Those books add to the plot in chunks  i e  cliff hanger chapter endings   But  in  The Girl on the Train   every plot part is revealed it bits and pieces throughout  This may seem odd  but to me as a reader  it allows me to have more time to think of what will happen next  Hawkins gives enough clues to find out what will happen next  and this adds new suspense to a reader who has the skills to do that Going back to what I started with  this book has truly changed the way I have thought about the world around me  Rachael has to do this to solve the crime  I won t say anymore than this   and in the end  she solves the crime  finds the murderer  gets a job  and solves her alcoholism  The way Hawkins is able to show how effective this is in the book and in real life is one of the many skills she has   The Girl on The Train  has been one of the most powerful  yet simple books I have ever read  Its ability to change the way I think in  real life  really showcases its beauty  Hawkins is able to use a simple exposition to create a powerful story  while not telling us each new part of the plot  She makes her characters into complex yet understandable people  I love this book for many reasons  and would definitely read it again  If Maeve Binchy wrote thrillers  it might be like this one  People compare it to Gillian Flynn  but I disagree  It didn t have that same intensity but it was mysterious none the less  I like how the main character was an ugly duckling and it didn t end in a normal storybook fashion  Very Binchy esc  The ugly duck is just that  normal with a side of crazy  Great read   All thrillers feel similar to me in a lot of ways  There are terrible ones  and occasionally great ones  but mostly they re all in between those two extremes  This is no exception  neither terrible or amazing  but satisfactorily entertaining  Tho I will say that I definitely preferred this one to Gone Girl  but I am one of the few who hated Gone Girl  sooo for me to say that is not exactly saying much One thing about this book is it was slightly misleading  The back blurb led me to believe one thing  but what really happened was something entirely different  tho that s not necessarily a negative  This is yet another thriller told thru coinciding alternate viewpoints  a chapter for one person  another chapter for another person  etc etc  This particular story unfolded in a pretty clever way  the opposing view points bringing about a unique and rounded story line  None of the characters were particularly likable  and Lord knows I m not one of those intellectuals who can usually rise above a hateful protagonist and like the book anyway  GONE GIRL  Confederacy of Dunces   but somehow  Hawkins managed to make these characters unlikable but yet still sympathetic  which was the key thing for me  And I hate to say this because anyone who s read the book will then think I am a psycho  but I found myself totally relating to Megan s character  Like a lot  It left me pondering the possibility of Hawkins having similar issues as myself because some of those things she described would be hard to tap into had you not had personal experience with them  OR maybe Hawkins just knew a crazy bitch once   My final verdict was a pretty pleased one  Despite the fact that I didn t really like the ending   something about it didn t sit right with me   but I was sufficiently surprised by it so I ll excuse whatever small feeling of dissatisfaction it left me with in favor of surprises and shocks  That s what a thriller is supposed to do right   Thrill me  I have to say   I was adequately thrilled   Caras vemos    No crei que me gustara el suspenso sin lo retorcido  pero este libro me atrapo desde el principio     The Girl on the Train is one messed up story  Every character in this book is pathetic and sad and the pacing did slow down about a third of the way through  However  I found the mystery compelling enough to keep listening  There ll be no rehash of the plot here since it has been broken down and examined by several thousand people already  I ll just say that the last third of the book was a LOT of fun to listen to and I had my earbuds glued to my ears until the grand finale  And I do think it was grand  considering  I m surprised that I enjoyed this audio as much as I did  Usually when everyone is raving about a book  I m the only one that hates it  I m glad that this time  I enjoyed the book too  It feels nice to belong  once in a great while A special thanks goes out to my friend Nev Murray who kindly gifted me this audio book  Thanks  Nev   This book was recommended as a  read if you liked Gone Girl  book and I agree  It was very good and very twisty   It s hard reading a book with unlikable characters  But that doesn t make this book any less gripping Girl on a Train starts rather innocently  with a young woman  Rachel  who takes a train to London every day  and watches  admires  a couple in their morning routine  outside on the terrace  When she sees something out of sorts  we take notice as she does  When Rachel learns the woman  Megan  is now missing  she feels that she must step forward and share what she saw  with the hope that this will help locate Megan We soon learn how unreliable Rachel is  she s an alcoholic with a history with both this location and its nearby occupants  She s lost her job  She s divorced because of her drinking  She takes the train every day to lend the appearance to her flatmate of going to work every day  when she s really just spending her time drinking or hanging out at the library Narration continually flips between Rachel and two other female characters  Megan and Anna  Rachel s ex s new wife   Watch the narrator and time changes when reading this one  because the narration isn t linear between shifts  It was hard to put this book down  I was anxious to find out what really happened the night of Megan s disappearance  There are clues throughout  but the ending was still somewhat surprising to me  This was a good choice for book club  I got sucked in from page one and had to keep tensely reading to solve the mystery of Rachel s blackouts and the truth of Megan  If you want thoroughly dysfunctional characters  a compelling mystery and just a great suspenseful read  I recommend this book  Most reviewers who didn t like this book hated the fucked up characters and the depressive  sullen mood of the story  That s exactly what I liked about it  It wasn t the mystery that I enjoyed most  or the major plot reveal  I thought those were okay  yet what made TGotT compelling for me  were the painfully disturbing characters  These characters aren t just unlikable  they are majorly messed up  Rachel  the alcoholic protagonist  was unsettling to read about  I could almost taste her misery in my mouth  from the self destructive behaviour  the irrational erratic moments  to the rare sparks of hope followed by relapse  No  I did not like the characters  Not Rachel  nor Anna  Megan or Scott  There are very few redeeming moments for all of them and I can see why so many hated this book because of it  But their unappeal was not gratuitous  In my eyes  this wasn t a novel wherein you are meant to identify with the characters  to relate  They are meant to make you sick  As a character study  this was an excellent book   Fun modern day mystery  loved all the red herrings throughout  The silly ending  however  had me going  Come on now  Really    I ll be interested to see if a screenwriter changes the ending when the book is inevitably made into a movie  Crean el hype  No es prosa de lujo  pero esta inteligentemente escrita y MUY bien estructurada  No lo veras venir  ese twist   Believe the hype  It s not high prose  but it s smartly written and VERY well structured  You won t see that twist coming  I really enjoyed this book  I agree with the other reviewers that the characters aren t likable  but I enjoyed Rachel as an alcoholic  unreliable narrator  It made the mystery and confusion regarding the problem believable because of her black outs  I listened to this on audio and the narrators were fantastic  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I listened  I highly recommend this novel  This author has an amazing but unbeknowst to me method for creating a book I couldn t put down  I found myself trying to figure out how I could get out of my personal commitments so that I could go read this darn book  I simply can t figure out why I liked this book   while reading it  so much  because in retrospect it hasn t really stayed with me  I found all of the characters quite unlikable and the voice changes from chapter to chapter were sometimes hard to get into  But  dang it  I wanted to know which despicable character had killed the other despicable one  One month after finishing this book  I cannot remember the characters  names but I do remember throughout the book thinking the names were forgettable and I was forever confusing one for the other  I wanted the drunk girl to redeem herself  I wanted the men to eventually man up  I wanted the dead girl to have had a purpose for living  I wanted the home wrecker to be honest to herself  How did I end up caring about these characters   Paula Hawkins got inside my head  and I may have to read this book again to unlock her mesmerizing effect  Do I recommend this book  Um  kinda   well  ask me next month    Really liked the idea and the pace of this though I did guess what who happened before the end Very suspenseful  The comparison to Gone Girl is an insult     This book is actually enjoyable   I never know if I tend to dislike books more when I listen to them on tape rather than reading them  but this book seemed kind of slow and plodding  especially at the beginning  and DH agreed   Luckily  it did pick up  and left us with a good mystery and stuff to talk about during our looong road trip  But the problem about a story where everyone has problems is that they often just aren t sympathetic to where the reader wants to root for them  I felt this way with all the main characters  really  Usually I really enjoy a realistic voice with problems  but it s hard to continue to have sympathy for alcoholics  for example  If you know that drinking is going to make you do horrible things  you d think you wouldn t do it so often   but yeah  it s an addiction  got it  Gripping and an ending I didn t guess  Also  I listened on audio and I think every book should be read by British narrators    What an amazing mystery   The Girl On the Train had me on the edge of my proverbial seat the entire time   Jessica already reviewed this same audio  and after reading her review post listen  I agree with basically everything she says The story is manipulative   It s the kind of mystery that makes your heart race as you try to discern any clues Hawkins may have left on the pages as to whodunit   I spent the entire book desperate for some kind of idea of who the killer was   And while I had my suspicions  that were right on the money  thankyouverymuch    I think Hawkins did a great job at making me second guess myself all the way to the end All of the characters are simply awful   Truly  there was not one character I actually liked  but I  didn t like  them in the best possible way   No pun intended  but listening to how they went through their situations was like watching a train wreck happen   You knew it was coming and you just couldn t look away   I liked that I disliked them because it gave the story a little bit of schadenfreude for me I m not going to spend a lot of time renumerating on this story since Jessica already did a fantastic review of it   But suffice to say I loved this audio   It was the kind of gripping mystery with awesome narration that I can easily become addicted to   I will definitely be looking for more from this author  Narrator 4 1 1 Clare Corbett  Louise Brealey  and India Fisher each narrated from a different character s point of view  and they were perfectly cast   Their voices fit the personalities so well and I enjoyed listening to them   I will definitely be looking for more of their performances This book may have been provided in exchange for an honest review  and therefore will be noted on the original post   I cannot stand Rachel omigod  I know she s going through some stuff  some serious depressing stuff even  I get that but she must at least see what her behavior have cost herself and people around her  But I like that she s not deeply rooted with vengeance towards her ex husband or the new wife  If she could just stop drinking urgh  If there s one thing I can learn from this book is how terrible drinking is  But the ending tho  I would have never suspected that Tom would do such thing  It was such a great shock because he was introduced to us as kind loving he s all that material husband kind of guy and Scott was introduced as someone possessive and abusive  And when he hurt Rachel  I really really thought it s Scott  I m annoyed with Detective Riley though and I m so thankful that her POV isn t in the book  Not only she s prejudice but she s also judgmental  When the author add Anna s POV  sometimes I have a hard time distinguishing between her and Rachel  Apart from what they think about and what they do  there s no difference in their tone  I ve read better POVish book  I think it would be more interesting if the author include Tom s POV  It will be fair towards the story  The first 50 pages of the book is kinda a drag  I checked  the excitement starts at page 50  Uuuuu what I like and hate the most about the book is how the characters were introduced  When you first read it  it felt like you accidentally skipped the introduction but actually  the introduction details were slipped in between the rambling    3 75 5 I expected this book to be really well written as so many people marketed this as the next Gone Girl  but it was lacking something for me  I didn t blow me away like Gone Girl did  and when there was a major reveal  I was like  oh alright ok  and couldn t really care  However  this was a really fun break from reading YA   If you liked Gone Girl  I think you ll enjoy this  Hawkins is a better writer in my opinion  More subtle  less cartoonish  We are all rubberneckers  some reluctant and secretive  some enthusiastic  So  what better place to rubberneck than from the window of a train  This is really the jumping off place for the whole plot here  A passenger on the train is witness to a crucial piece of evidence  or what she perceives as such  in the disappearance of a young woman  Lives are enmeshed  People are and aren t quite who you thought them to be  And we are all peering out of the train intently to see if we can get a glimpse  Psychological crime novels fall somewhere in the no man land between mainstream fiction and detective genre  which is a hard game to play  but I think Hawkins did it well  Not masterfully like say Smilla s Sense of Snow  but well  Page turingingly well  The characters while mostly quite believable  are all various shades of yuck  And here is the major issue that MomToKippy brought up  How to care about  or enjoy  a book if you dislike are revolted by all the characters  Good question  I recently had this issue on Netflix s series Bloodline  I have a different take though  Rachel  the heroin here  is a falling down drunk  a pathetic  lying manipulator  never met a drunk who isn t any of these things actually   It s a bit hard to care who prevails when the best possible character spends a lot of time doing things like lying  peeing herself  blacking out and vomiting  Anyway  and perhaps it s the relative repulsiveness of all the other significant characters  I was still rooting for her  But it s more than that  She s a real underdog and you really want her to pull through  and you want to know what happens  you really do  At least I did  Read it in 2 sittings  My library has a 25 person waitlist  and I have two friends begging for my copy  Crime fiction with a psychological angle  this is for you  It leaves Gone Girl in the dust IMO   4 5 5 starsWell    That was unexpected  There are so many books in this self publishing era I just can t finish that I give this one 4 stars for keeping my interest until the end  However  the characters are all really pathetic and unlikeable which makes it really hard to care about what happens to them  The main detective work revolves around the female protagonist being blacked out drunk all the time and not remembering what happens  which is tiring  The ultimate answer to the mystery in the book is satisfying  however it s somewhat ruined by a ridiculous twist at the very end   I had heard a lot of chatter surrounding this book long before I read it  anyone who saw me reading Gone Girl a while back would immediately follow up  Well have you read The Girl on the Train    So when I finally got my hands on a copy  I decided to give it a shot The biggest thing I can say about this book is that really gathered steam as it went  In the first couple of chapters  I had a little trouble getting my teeth into the story and the characters  but as time went on  it really came together in an amazing crescendo  There was suspense  there was some adventure  and a lot of the things I was at first kind of skeptical about all played vital roles in the book s conclusion  It s a fairly quick read  and it does sort of echo Gone Girl s suspense and twisting plot  so it s little surprise that the two have been talked about in the same breath so frequently  Definitely worth the read  especially since it s such a buzz book right now   a slow start but once I got into it I really enjoyed it Um livro de cortar a respiracao  Apesar de a verdadeira accao ficar circunscrita as ultimas 100 paginas  nem tanto   dai ter dado 4 estrelas  Mas recebe justamente o titulo de livro do ano de 2015  Recomendo   Ding Dong   voix suave   Les passagers a destination du polar psychologique sont pries d embarquer Que ceux qui veulent aller vite changent de train et montent dans un TGV  Mais ils ne verront jamais ce qu il se passe dans les maisons qui longent la ligne de notre banlieusard Qui n a jamais ete tente de jeter un coup d oeil dans les maisons qui se trouvent a

aurait ete tellement captivee par le roman qu elle n aurait jamais zieute la vie de ce couple a la vie si parfaite et ne les aurait pas baptise Jason et Jess Rachel    j ai eu envie de la tuer  vous savez  De lui plonger la tete dans de l eau glacee et de lui murmurer a l oreille qu il serait plus que temps de se reprendre au lieu de sombrer dans les delices des bouteilles de vin blanc  et elle a mauvais gout  du blanc  beurk    Rachel    plus epave que la    Licorne    apres avoir sombre  plus imbibee qu une eponge  elle vivote  telle une amibe  chez sa copine  se lamentant encore et encore sur son ex qui l a quittee pour une autre  Sa vie par en    quenouille  vous avez eu peur  je parie  et elle ne fait rien pour inverser la courbe Rachel    qui m a enervee a toujours geindre  a ne pas avoir de volonte  et a se plaindre encore et encore pour des choses qu elle a faite mais dont elle ne garde aucun souvenir  Bref  un personnage que j ai deteste de prime abord  On est d accord que c etait de prime abord   Ici  on fait dans le roman policier psychologique  les personnages sont bien travailles  tous bien distincts les uns des autres  avec leurs qualites  leurs defauts Le recit est articule autour de trois narratrices   Rachel l eponge  Anna la voleuse du mari de Rachel et Megan    Jess     la femme qui se veut independante Le changement de narrateur vous empeche aussi de flinguer Rachel parce que  plus de 300 pages avec elle en train de se lamenter et de regarder sa vie partir en lambeaux  je n aurais pas tenu sans commettre un crime L avantage du recit  aussi  c est les petits retours dans le passe  avec Megan  afin de savoir ce qu il s est passe avant sa disparition Chiche en personnages mais riche dans leur profondeur  ce roman  une fois ouvert  se referme difficilement  Hormis lorsque vous arrivez a la derniere page  of course Bien qu on ne courre pas dans tous les sens  les aller retour entre le passe et le present pimentent le recit  font monter la pression  a biere  et nous font mousser Au debouchage  le vin avait l air banal  peu engageant    Mais une fois la premiere gorgee avalee  les tanins se font sentir  le gout prend toute sa saveur et le recit roule sur la langue  est long en bouche  vous monte a la tete et on a qu une envie   se resservir  Bluffee j ai ete et bien que j ai eu des soupcons sur le personnage qui avait tue le docteur Lenoir dans la bibliotheque avec la cle anglaise  Mais j avoue qu avant de pointer correctement le coupable  j avais un peu vise a cote Un roman plus psychologique que trepidant  c est pas 24H chrono   plus profond que leger  et bien plus interessant qu il ne me laissait penser au depart  Mention speciale a un personnage foutrement bien campe   Machiavelique ce roman  Ding Dong  Veuillez attacher vos ceintures  ca pourrait secouer durant le voyage de ce train  The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins easily scored a spot on my top reads list  the twists and turns were perfectly placed and the wobbly credibility of main character was written in a way that was both convincing and questionable all at the same time  Hawkins  writing is masterful in this thrilling novel that I couldn t put down The story is told from multiple points of view but often from the viewpoint of Rachel  a alcoholic woman in her 30 s who can see no apparent reason to get her addiction under control  Even though she s lost her job and has no prospects on the horizon  she travels back and forth on the same commuter trains every weekday morning and evening  When her home bound train comes to one of its regular stops every evening  Rachel checks in on a couple she has come to call Jason and Jess  In her mind  they are the perfect couple and they resemble everything that she has lost When something terrible happens on the street where Jason and Jess live  Rachel can t help but insert herself into the investigation   after all  she s a perfect day to day eyewitness from the train  isn t she Reading Paul Hawkins  words felt like being inside Rachel s head  unable to completely trust the memories that she knows to be true and unable to recover the memories that hold clues to what happened that night  As she struggles to get her alcoholic ways under control and put her heartbreaking past behind her  she tumbles further and further into an investigation she may have no business being a part of  With every new memory and piece of information uncovered  the reader is just as torn as Rachel is  save herself and get out or get her memories back and possibly help save a new friend I highly recommend picking up this thriller  After the first couple of chapters I had made decisions on all the characters involved    and they only ended up twisting and turning throughout the rest of the book  including my opinions on Rachel  Hawkins  words are deliberate and well thought out  careful to never give away too much of the truth until it is absolutely necessary  It took a little bit to get into it  but it intrigued me  Then I suddenly couldn t put it down  If I could  I would give it another half star for that alone  I was suspecting everyone at different points  which made me keep reading  Much better ending than Gone Girl too  Fast read and I enjoyed that it had different characters perspectives  but they were shorter and Rachel was still the protagonist  I could see it being a good movie too  Sometimes the characters seemed pathetic  and even though almost everyone hated Rachel  including herself   I found myself rooting for her  Left me feeling like I made the right choice with the way it ended  This is one of those books that you cannot let go unless you have read the end  I felt the book dragged on a bit in the middle few pages  Nevertheless a very revetting read  Slow start  difficulty with some dialogue  but the ending was worth the read So many people compared this debut book to Gone Girl  Gone Girl was a terrible hate filled book  there  I said it  This book was hard for me to get into because of the  other book    Starts off with Rachel  an alcoholic and I thought of pitching it  but glad I continued  Gripping  tense  I did not like any of the characters  still a riveting story I just had to finish   Rachel is the girl on the train  The same daily dull trip until one day she saw something shocking that will change everything    Given the subject matter present here  so dark and murky at times a reader needs a halogen headlamp  it may sound a bit flippant to admit this book was a breath of fresh air  I ve hit a dry patch with my reading in the past few weeks  it was just refreshing to find something that was engaging  good  and utterly unputdownable  There were parts of this book where I actually let out a scandalized  Ooooh  in the manner of a fifth grader watching cafeteria cat fight  It s the kind of book you find yourself taking breaks from not only to absorb and reflect on what s happening  but also to stretch it out a little longer to prolong the enjoyment Thrillers tend to not be my cup of tea  When the plot focuses on the  whodunit  rather than the  whydunit  or  howdunit   I lose interest if only because the question of  who  is typically answered within the first few chapters  There s a quote out there  something about a shotgun prominently above the mantel in the first act must be fired in the third  In my experience  this is how the books of this genre typically seem to play out   view spoiler  There s not really a whole lot of mystery in the mystery book when you know the Big Bad is going to be one of the three or so main characters   hide spoiler   The comparisons between Girl on the Train and Gone Girl are inevitable  obvious and accurate   beyond pointing this out  I don t even want to say how or why the two are similar because I want to strictly avoid spoilers  Sufficed to say  the similarities go beyond breathless blurb hype about this Girl being the new Girl  In my opinion  Gone Girl s greatest strength was the journey  not the destination  When The Girl on the Train keeps the focus on the journey  on the characters themselves it is gripping and engaging and at times completely heartbreaking  A quick and dirty summary   not to sound lazy but I hate writing plot blurbs  The summary you read on the book s jacket or on Amazon is accurate  Go with that   Rachel s life has gone down the crapper  She s a barely functioning divorced alcoholic  Recently fired from her job due to her drinking problem  Rachel still goes through the motions of her old routine by riding the train into the city every morning and home every evening  rather than come clean to the old college friend from whom she s renting a room  The route the train takes passes by Rachel s old neighborhood  passing by not only the house she shared with her ex husband but also a home occupied by two beautiful strangers  Catching only glimpses into the lives of these two people  Rachel invents a perfect fantasy for the two of them  only to have this fantasy shattered when   stuff happens  Making an effort to avoid spoilers while still discussing the book makes for a tricky review  what can I say The characters are multilayered onions  their connections to one another are wickedly tangled  That is where the true twists and turns come with TGotT  can I abbreviate  I m going to   not about the mystery behind the Big Bad but on the characters themselves  The reader s footing is never sure with anyone  three cheers for unreliable narrators  There are no clear cut good or bad guys because just as Rachel s perspective on the lives she invents for these people she sees ends up on it s ear  anything the reader determines about the character of the characters can shift dramatically  My absolute favorite characters in any book are the unlikable ones   not the cool anti heroes  not the self insert blank slates  not the perfectly perfect Mary Sues  To me  tropes are hard sells  Give me a character that has actual flaws with a dose of ugly humanity any day of the week  And Rachel  the titular girl on train  is so damned dark  You switch from feeling extraordinarily sorry for her to being disgusted with her antics to wanting to give her a hug to wishing you could just shake her and demand she pull herself together To state independently of motivation  the things these characters do are terrible  Not just Rachel but pretty much every single person featured  A laundry list of their sins include adultery  abuse  manipulation  cruelty  judgment  lying and more  They do terrible things  immoral things  things the gutcheck response might just be  Oh  that is just unforgivable   But then another layer is peeled off the onion  a little more is revealed and it suddenly becomes not so cut and dried  not so easy to assign blame or judgement  And yet  the terrible acts still stand  But  Throughout the book  there is explanation for the terrible things  Aside from the Big Bad  while there initially there is no demand for absolution  more on that in a second  for the terrible things there is at least understanding for why they were done in the first place My only disappointment with the book came in the final quarter  Near the end it dissolves into a breathless   Woman in Jeopardy  Lifetime movie  It stumbles and moves from understanding of the above mentioned terrible things to a rather hoary demand for both absolution and and then of course  redemption which I found heavy handed  disappointing  view spoiler   Putting this behind a cut even though I m going to vague it up   the who in whodunit is fairly obvious from the midpoint of the book  shotgun over the mantle style  All the same  at the end it was a let down to have the framing set up to explain why people did the things they did  explaining their actions and such  only to have the reasoning behind the Big Bad s actions be summed up more or less as  Yup  This person is evil  Pure evil  Bake  em away  toys   And I don t know   maybe that s the point  in a Stampy the Elephant sort of way  Some people are just jerks    hide spoiler  One of the reviews here on good reads says something along the lines of if you are considering this book  stop reading reviews and get it  I agree wholeheartedly  It wasn t without it s flaws  but this was an entertaining  gripping read  I really enjoyed it  I could definitely see this going on my re read list and I look forward to seeing more of this author s work in the future  This was an interesting read It was faster paced and quite thrilling with lots of twists and turns But in the end the the plot kinds of gave away itself I mean if you can guess whats gonna happen next then there s not much left to the story is it The writing is refreshingly amazing given this is her first time writing a novel I liked the way she presented the characters Now about the comparison with Gone Girl there s not much stuffs common between them apart from them both being thrillers Gone Girl had kind of an unique twist whereas the twist in this plot has done many times before All in all I quite liked the book I had to read it within a day given the suspense it was building up And I can say it was worth it  It s a taught thriller of a book  I wanted to read it because of all the hype  and for the most part I understand why The Girl on the Train became such a phenomenon this year  For me  the juxtaposition of viewpoints was the strong attribute of the story  It s what kept this book at a good pace  and actually helped to increase the intensity in the latter half of the book  If it wasn t for alternating views  I probably would have become overly frustrated with the main character after the first 100 pages The ending was slightly off for me  but in not disappointment  A great first book for this author  I actually really enjoyed this  It was a really easy read and despite predictable turns it dragged me out of a reading slump  Full video review here  Enthralling and fast paced  Great setup and narration  The ending could be less cheesy but overall a good summer read   I would rate this book 4 5 stars  Most of the book was the kind of thriller that I didn t want to put down so I finished it quickly and found it an engrossing read  The reason I didn t give it 5 stars was that there was some inconsistency in terms of the main character s  Rachel  relationship with her ex husband  Tom  and the ending of the book   view spoiler   Right up until the end of the book Rachel views Tom very positively and remembers all the great parts about their relationship  He is described as if he is an empathetic person who left her because her drinking made her intolerable and he had just fallen in love with someone else  Then when he is revealed at the end to be basically a sociopath who just uses people for his own means it didn t ring true that Rachel  despite her alcoholic blackouts  wouldn t have had any memories of him that were anything other than positive or any warning bells that he had treated other people badly during their time together  For me this book would have been much more interesting if Tom s new wife Anna had turned out to be the murderer   hide spoiler   This is a great  well written and well crafted thriller    I read it in one day and did not want to put it down  Very gripping  The author draws you into the characters  you care about them even if  most of the time  you may not particularly like them That said  I found the voices of the three women to be very similar  in fact  indistinguishable at times  And a bit old fashioned  At one point  Rachel says that women are only valued for their looks and their roles as mothers  All three women appear to value themselves only in relationship to a man  I suppose that women like this do still exist  but I do not happen to know any   A fun  quick read  Not a real puzzler of a whodunit  but well written with fully realized characters  I enjoyed it   This was a solid 4 5 stars for me It grabbed me and kept me sucked in from start to finish  I devoured it I enjoyed the shifting POV  It kept me on my toes  The three main women were fucked up and unstable  so they made really unreliable narrators     which added to the mystery  to trying to figure out what was really going on I won t say that the ending was a major shock  I had my suspicions  and near the end I just needed confirmation  Regardless  it was all wrapped up in a satisfying way  Yes  I loved this  Loved the crazy  unreliable narrators  I just sat back and let them take for their whack job  unstable ride  I liked that this was jumbled  but fast paced  yet teeth grindingly slow at times  OK  we get that Rachel is drunk   again  and whiplash fast at others  With some nice little red herrings  and characters you love to hate  once good thing is this book will sure make you feel better about yourself  One caveat   you will crave a gin and tonic  but think twice about actually having one   Wow   The Girl on the Train  takes voyeurism to a whole new level  What a great story with lots of twists and surprises  all the way to the end  The story was intricate and the characters well developed  I found myself shaking my head   talking  to the characters  getting angry and frustrated  being empathetic  hoping for a few different outcomes  But  be warned  once you start reading  this is a hard book to put down    One unreliable narrator after another  this story is packed to the rim with confusion and doubt  I was constantly wondering what was going on  who was good  who was bad    all of it  All of these characters were flawed  All of them put doubts in my mind  And all of them had me questioning their every move I was utterly void of any culprit guess throughout the entire story  I do have to say I m the type of reader that doesn t attempt to figure out the story  I just kind of go with it  So maybe that s why I had NO IDEA who I should be hating on at any given moment  So many characters  all terrible in their own way    it was a pretty chaotic ride I can t say I was gripping my seat  terrified  wondering what was going to happen next  I didn t really have that feeling at all  until closer to the end   It was much more suspenseful than thrilling to me  I was immediately drawn in and felt as if I was completely lost from page 1  yet I liked being lost  I was so eager to unravel this intricate weave of horrific events  characters  and scenarios one page at a time  It was definitely intense  and I was sucked right in  I have lost control over everything  even the places in my head  A powerful story filled to the brim with doubt  questions  and suspicions  A story that will make you question everything you know about everyone you ve encountered  how quickly we form judgments on a person before we truly  know  them  and will surely have you feeling frustrated  disgusted  and even empathy at times  If you enjoy psychological thrillers  you won t want to miss this one Audiobook Impressions All of these narrators were really great  My first time for each one  And though I honestly have difficulty with accents quite often  these three narrators quashed that issue of mine immediately  I would definitely recommend the audiobook for this story  Thanks to Penguin Audio for the review copy  Find this review and others like it at Lost in Literature     In the wake of  Gone Girl  I can see how this book got so much attention  There really is nothing quite like an unreliable narrator  but this book is sort of not that  It is  however  a fast past  well structured from the outside in to the solution style thriller Three women are at the crux of this thing  that is staged around one woman s lonely daily trip into and out of central London on the train  a trip that is fake  since you come to find out she s been sacked from her PR job for being drunk at work  after being ditched by her husband for a hotter  more fertile replacement It does not contain anyone you can really identify with  or  like  as I m told by readers and editors that one  must have   although  Rachel  is set up to be that  We ve all been heartbroken by life and she is a sad sack for a lot of reasons that feel very realistic even though her cringe worthy actions get a bit stale after a while  The novel s over arching  good girl  vs   bad girl  thing sort of bugged me once I figured out  who did it   But the author keeps you on the edge of your seat with a fast paced narrative  Although you see the plot train coming  you can t stop watching so as to see how it all ends I give it 4 stars here but it s really more a 3 5 in my mind  5 stars for writing style  2 5 for plot  No mejor que Perdida  pero adictiva y entretenida  a pesar que la trama no se enfoca realmente en el misterio   Das Leben ist kein Absatz und der Tod ist keine Klammer  S  19Es wurde viel Wind um  Girl on the Train  gemacht  Letztendlich konnte ich mich dem Buch nicht entziehen  da ich immer wahnsinnig interessiert daran bin  was wirklich hinter dem Hype steckt  Der Erzahlstil der Geschichte gefiel mir gut  Die Szenen sind zeitlich abgegrenzt mit Datumsangabe sowie den Tageszeiten morgens nachmittags abends  Das war wie eine Art Tagebuch oder Protokoll der Ereignisse  Paula Hawkins erzahlt die Geschichte aus der Sicht von Rachel  aus der von Jess  die eigentlich Megan heisst  sowie aus der von Anna  die neue Frau von Rachels Ex Mann  Dabei gibt sie allen drei Frauen gleich viel Raum  sodass man nicht unbedingt nur von Rachel als Hauptprotagonistin ausgehen kann Sie sind allesamt schwierige Charaktere  die beim Leser nicht unbedingt Sympathien wecken durften  Rachel hat seit einigen Jahren mit einem Alkoholproblem zu kampfen  Ihr Mann hat sie deswegen fur eine andere verlassen und durch die Trinkerei hat sie auch ihren Job verloren  Sie versucht den Schein aufrecht zu erhalten  in dem sie immer noch so tut  als wurde sie jeden Morgen zur Arbeit fahren  Sie steigt in den Zug  nur um abends wieder zu ihrer Mitbewohnerin zuruckzukehren  Sie lebt eindeutig in ihrer eigenen Welt  was sich auch dadurch abzeichnet  dass sie sich diese Geschichten zu Megan und Scott alias  Jess  und  Jason  ausdenkt  Anfangs empfindet man vielleicht noch eine Art Mitleid fur sie  aber sie begeht einfach immer und immer wieder dieselben Fehler  sodass man sie sehr schnell einfach nur schutteln mochte  Anna und Megan sind allerdings auch nicht unbedingt die Heldinnen des Romans  Megan hat ein traumatisches Erlebnis aus Jugendjahren nie wirklich verarbeitet  sodass sie bis heute nicht immer nachvollziehbare Sachen macht und Anna wirkt mit ihrer Paranoia und ihrem Beschutzerinstikt um ihr Kind eher nervig  Je weiter man liest  desto mehr bekommt man das Gefuhl  dass jeder hier in der Geschichte einen psychischen Knacks weg hat Die Geschichte beginnt sehr langsam mit einer Einfuhrung in Rachels Leben  ihren Gewohnheiten  ihrer Vergangenheit sowie ihrer Fantasie bezuglich Megan und Scott  Richtig interessant wurde das Ganze aber erst  als Megan plotzlich verschwindet  Rachel war an diesem Abend in der Nahe von Megan  hat aber keinerlei Erinnerung mehr daran  was passiert ist  weswegen sie der Sache auf den Grund gehen will  Sie versucht Stuck fur Stuck zu rekonstruieren  was an diesem Abend geschehen ist  versucht die Lucken zu fullen und muss sich dafur nicht nur mit den letzten Tagen  sondern mit ihrer gesamten Vergangenheit auseinandersetzen und wie ihr Leben letzten Endes den Bach runter ging  Das Buch hat mich durchaus gefesselt und ich wollte schon wissen  was mit Megan passiert ist und was Rachel damit zu hat  Aber das Buch wies zwischendurch einige Langen auf  die es zu uberbrucken galt  gerade wenn Rachel mal wieder dabei war sich zu betrinken und es mich leider uberhaupt nicht mehr interessiert hat  was dann mit ihr passiert oder wie es ihr geht  Zum Schluss macht es die Autorin nochmal spannend  auch wenn ich mir relativ fruh denken konnte  was passiert ist  Das hat dem ganzen ein bisschen den Spass wieder genommen  Den Weg zur Losung hat Paula Hawkins aber verstandlich und luckenlos dargestellt ohne dabei zu ubertreiben  AbschlusswortBei  Girl on the Train  nehmen vorallem die Charaktere viel Raum ein  Im Endeffekt erzahlen sie alle auf ihre eigene Art und ihren Wahrnehmungen die gleiche Geschichte  Dabei ecken sie immer wieder an und manchmal ist ihnen offenbar nicht mehr zu helfen  sodass sie nicht unbedingt Sympathien wecken werden  Was das Ganze aber wiederum in einem interessanten Licht erscheinen lasst  da einem hier nicht die heile Welt vorgespielt wird  wie es sonst oft der Fall ist  Das Buch ist fur mich kein richtiger Thriller  aber auch kein Krimi  Es ist eine Art Spannungsroman  der zwar einige Langen aufweist  sich aber um die alles entscheidende Frage was wirklich geschehen ist durchaus lesen lassen kann  Rachel takes the same commuter train to work every morning  It s a slow one  often stopping at the same signal for minutes at a time  Rachel watches a house that backs onto the tracks and the couple that live inside  In her head she s named them Jason and Jess and she s constructed a whole life for them  In the summer she watches as they sit on a makeshift terrace  sipping coffee Rachel tries to avoid looking several houses down from Jason and Jess s house as that s where she used to live  In the before  Before she started drinking so much she blacked out and woke up with gaps in her memories  Before she found out her husband Tom was having an affair  Before Anna moved in  with her growing belly One day a headline catches Rachel s attention  Jess s real name is Megan and she s missing  And the night she went missing  Rachel was lurking around the area  trying to talk to Tom again  But she was very drunk and even though she thinks she might know something  she has to unlock it from her brain  There are things that aren t adding up   but who is going to trust a drunk who can t let her ex husband go It seems like the publishing industry is always promising readers the next something  This one is marketed as Rear Window meets Gone Girl and I love the concept because I suspect that most people have a little Rachel in them  I don t mean the drinking to excess  although some probably have that too  and the stalking the ex  ditto  but I think there are a lot of people out there  myself included  who have a bit of the voyeur  Rachel has seen a couple from the window of the train she takes every day and she s constructed a whole life for them  She s given them names  Jason and Jess   created careers for them  imagines what they get up to when they re in other parts of the house where she can t see them  She s come to believe in them  feel like she knows them  In Rachel s head  Jason and Jess are real people  almost like friends Rachel has been on a downward spiral for years now with the ending of her marriage  She was already drinking before the end of it but now she just drinks more  She rents a room from her friend Cathy  who prides herself on her niceness but Rachel is testing even that with her behaviour  She drinks on the way home from work on the train  she drinks during the day  When she s not thinking about Jason and Jess  she s thinking about Tom  She leaves countless messages on his mobile  she calls the house repeatedly and in the middle of the night  she goes around there and stands in the street and has  on occasion  made more of a nuisance of herself than that  Rachel does and says a lot of things that she cannot remember and even though as a reader you feel sorry for her for the demise of her marriage  there s no denying that quite frankly  Rachel is an absolute mess and at times warrants more disgust than pity  And yet there s clearly something in her mind  just on the fringes  that Rachel cannot access  At times I feared for her wellbeing  like on the night she s out near the train station closest to Jason and Jess  really named Scott and Megan  and all she has the next mornings are bruises  an injury on her skull that looks like she s been deliberately hit and the vague recollection of a guy with red hair grabbing her arm The Girl On The Train starts out with a glimpse into a dissolute and ruined life and inserts it into a mystery  The story gently guides you along in one direction before neatly presenting the first of many twists and turns  Chances are most people will figure it out before the end but sometimes  it s not about the endgame  It s about how you get there and I think that this book does a great job in constructing the story that takes you there  Rachel is so unreliable and so pathetic that you wonder just how she could possibly have the answer to what day it is  let alone much more than that  Told in three parts with points of view from Rachel  Anna and Megan  each of these characters are multifaceted and at times  utterly unlikable  Rachel should ve moved away from the area when the marriage ended instead of taking the train every morning that takes her past her old house and allows her glimpses into her ex husband s new life  She definitely shouldn t be calling  turning up  and on one occasion  going into the house  Anna gloried in her role as mistress and gave little to no thought to the woman that preceded her until she began to wonder if history was repeating itself  Megan has had a difficult past and she s restless and reckless The Girl On The Train is an interesting look at relationships and how very rarely are they what they seem  Rachel has memories of her marriage with Tom  she has constructed a relationship for Jason and Jess that differs from the reality  Anna  likewise has perceptions of her relationship with Tom and believes that things are truly different for them  She blames Rachel and her drinking  feels pity for Tom and what he had to put up with  People believe what they want to about others and especially about themselves  Things are always different when it s you This was a tight  enjoyable thriller that I had to read in a single sitting  I devoured this book  It is unlike anything I have read and was even frustrating at times  The main character has issues  to say the least  and you really just want to smack her sometimes  The story has enough twists to keep you guessing and I didn t figure things out until WAY towards the end after she has practically told you who did what  This book will have you rethinking how you view other people  I recommend it to most people  but if you get annoyed by weak main characters  this book will just make you crazy   Being someone who loves to people watch  and spends a lot of time catching trains    I obviously had to pick up this book  Do you ever see someone and wonder what their life is like  Maybe you ve created stories for people you see regularly on your daily commute  at school  or work  What if you saw them every day  living their exciting and wonderful life    only to have them suddenly disappear  Rachel is thrust into the middle of a dark and complicated whirlwind of relationships  betrayal and lies  She never thought anything bad would happen to her  Jess   Jason   nor did she think she d be connected in ways she d never imagined  I didn t know a lot going into this book  only that it has been compared to Gone Girl  which I m still yet to read   and I see it EVERYWHERE  For some reason  I was expecting a completely different story  but was still hooked regardless  From the first page  The Girl on the Train held me tightly and wouldn t let go until I d read the last sentence  There were some slower parts in the middle  where things started to feel a bit repetitive and boring  but it soon picked up again and finished with a bang  Throughout the novel  we re presented with the perspectives of Rachel  Anna and Megan  I found it easy to differentiate their voices from one another  and enjoyed reading each of their chapters   though Rachel s  main character  was my favourite  I could really connect with how her mind worked   she s constantly observing people and creating stories for them  wanting to figure them out  wanting to solve things  Unlike Rachel however  I ve never had a drop of alcohol  and she s a raging alcoholic  Hahaha  Because of this  she was a rather unreliable narrator at times  and I was confused and annoyed with a lot of the things she did  which ultimately made the situation worse    but it all added to the suspense throughout  I ll admit  just a little over halfway through the book  I knew what was going on and also what was going to happen  but it didn t spoil anything for me at all  I do have some unanswered questions regarding some of the characters and their relationships with one another  but nothing too major  Being her debut novel  Hawkins wrote an amazing  gripping and fast paced story that definitely deserves the hype it s been getting I m definitely planning on reading any other books she releases in the future  and will at some point  soon  hopefully   be picking up Gone Girl  because now I m in the mood for thrillers  XD Definitely recommended  The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a debut novel that may just become the psychological thriller of 2015  I don t read many thriller or mystery novels but I was hooked on this one from the start  It was my first book of 2015 and I devoured it all in one day This book is already being compared to Gone Girl  The Silent Wife  and Before I Go To Sleep  and even though I have only read one of those  The Silent Wife   I can see why  This is going to be a talked about book  in fact it already is  I don t generally gravitate toward thrillers  I never felt the pull to read Gone Girl even when everyone was talking about it  But something about this book grabbed me when I read the blurb and it held on to me tightly from the very first page  The movie rights to the book were acquired by DreamWorks back in March  so you know that this is going to be one of the big books of 2015 You can read my full review here I liked this book  Did seem similar to Gone Girl which I liked as well On the surface  Rachel  the girl on the train  appears to be the ordinary commuter  Catching the same train every day  she observes life and in particular  the life of those who live in the trackside houses  Her journey provides an escape  it allows her to break away from her compulsive drinking  self pitying and relentless thoughts of her ex husband  Tom  and his new family   living in their old home  Jess and Jason   a beautiful couple whose terrace balcony can be seen from the train  provide much entertainment for Rachel s imagination   she feels as though she knows the intricate details of their perfect life at 15 Blenheim Road  Staggering through each day  Rachel provides an obsessive account of the couples life as she sees it  One day  she is shocked by what she sees  Shortly afterwards  she recognises the face of  Jess  on the front of a newspaper   she has vanished  Between her alcoholism and blackouts  Rachel becomes knotted in the lives of the couple  attempting to tell the police everything she knows  the blue dress  the red haired man  the underpass  her bleeding lip Emulating Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl  Hawkins demonstrates the gripping nature of juggling perspectives  including the flawed and undependable protagonist  The Girl on the Train builds unanticipated empathy  alluring characters  enthralling twists  guesses and second guesses  A compulsive 8 out of 10 For more of my book reviews  www writingaboutreading101 wordpress com 3 5 starsHaving the habit of not reading about a book before reading it  I had no idea what this story was about but after all the buzz about it I was expecting something more disturbing than Gone Girl  I feel a bit disappointed because although the story is kind of creepy  it is far from the amount of distress I felt after reading Gone Girl I couldn t sympathize with any of the characters  they were annoying and miserable in their own way  creepy and overbearing I have no respect for cheaters so Megan and Tom were even more repulsive to me    Anna is included in the cheaters category by association I just couldn t understand why Rachel was mislead all that time  come on  don t you talk to your friends or wouldn t you try to find out if you really did all that crap to try to apologize or something    I felt isolated in my misery  I became lonely  so I drank a bit  and then a bit more  and then I became lonelier  because no one likes being around a drunk  I lost and I drank and I drank and I lost  It took me a long time to be sure who it was  it wasn t that predictable this time but after the truth is out the development was quite a downer  I was expecting a smarter explanation than that and a more exciting turn of events    a real twist  Just comes to show that the grass is not always greener    appearances can definitely be deceiving  Yes  I got sucked in and bought a book that s been  1 on the bestseller s list for a couple months  Did it live up to the hype  In a way  yes  Once it got going  the plot was fast paced and had lots of twists and turns  reminding me of an episode of Dateline NBC  The weird thing is that I never really liked any of the characters or was rooting for them in any way  I think it s unusual that I give a four star rating to a book with characters I didn t like  If you re looking for a book with sex  violence  deception and alcohol abuse  sounds like Dateline  doesn t it    this is the book for you   This book is exactly as advertised  a fast paced  psychological thriller  Great read  Primero que nada quiero aclarar que es un 4 5El libro me gusto  la trama y como te lleva a querer terminarlo de una vez por todas La lectura es agil  rapida de leer  Me encanta la esencia que da al ya creer que tienes al culpable y al final resulta que no es  El libro es bueno en si  pero no es lo que esperaba  durante todo el libro de hace tener altas expectativas del final pero no resulta lo que realmente querias para el final  Igual y me hubiese gustado que hubiera un corto epilogo  No me arrepiento de leerlo  es una buena lectura para pasar el rato  ya que te cautiva desde la sinopsis  Es mi primer resena  no me critiquen  buenos si pero criticas constructivas  A good thriller  pulls you right in  I always like it when a narrator waffles between being trustworthy or untrustworthy  it makes the story more interesting  and I find myself questioning all that has happened   What a ride  Ms  Hawkins  The Girl on the Train  did a great job of keeping me hooked in this  whodunit   I felt for the characters  by felt I mean a range of feelings from disgust to sympathy  though I can t say that I LIKED any of them  They all pissed me off pretty well at one point or another  but I think that adds to this selection for me  Not a fan of the characters  though character development was well done   but was still eager to find out the truth Great read   Life is not a paragraph  and death is no parenthesis   The Girl on the Train follows Rachel as she commutes on the same train everyday  On the train she looks out the window and sees a couple living in a house  Rachel makes up a life for them and goes as far as to give them names  jobs  and personality traits  One day she sees something that changes her view of the fictional couple  She decides to go to the police with the information  but she soon realizes that she s made the situation worse I read this book because of the comparison to Gone Girl  I wanted to read something similar to Gone Girl  the awful characters  plot twist  etc    In my opinion  The Girl on the Train is not as good or as well plotted as Gone Girl but it is still cohesive and twisted story worth the read The writing style in this book is what makes the book worth reading  It is written in diary format that oscillates from morning to evening  There are big portions of the story missing and the writer of the diary selects what portions are told to the reader and which are omitted  It also allows the characters to reveal information selectively  As a reader you think you know the full story  but a few chapters later you realize that you don t know the full story and you were only fed bits and pieces  This realization makes the reader second guess the information being told and the character  The characters in this book are written with precision  The author did a fantastic job of making the reader feel sympathy for the main character then slowly change your opinion about her  You feel one way about her at the beginning of the book  but by the end you feel something else entirely  The pacing of this book is slow  which is not a bad thing  The focus of this story is on the characters and their actions and thoughts  Sip this story like a hot cup of tea because you ll appreciate it more  So just enjoy the narrative  slow pace  and story as it slowly unfolds Overall  The Girl on the Train is an interesting read about people  Do not expect a thrill ride with an incredible mystery  This book is first and foremost about people  Enjoy the writing  the characters  and the plot as it slowly unfolds  Sit back and enjoy the ride  I really enjoyed this book  From the first page I could tell that the narrator was crazy  and I wanted to find out what happens  Very entertaining  4 5 StarsAnother fast paced psychological thriller that kept me glued to its pages If you re a fan of Gillian Flynn s twisted  artful  and suspenseful storytelling  I d recommend checking out The Girl on the Train Have you ever gazed through the window on a train and wondered what the people living in those houses you pass are doing with their lives  Perhaps you ve conjured up your own theories  mentally orchestrating their daily occurrences all while longing to obtain the security you ve imagined they possess Rachel s life has become entirely engulfed by these sorts of daydreams  zeroing in on one couple in particular    a couple she spots daily out on their terrace during her train ride into work  Rachel sees them as beautiful and happy  peaceful and together  All that she is not  As Rachel s once happy life devolves into a nightmare of alcoholism and loneliness  she finds solace in these quiet minutes on the train  But when her path crosses with the  perfect  people of her daydreams  Rachel gets a chilling dose of reality    All is not always as it seems  and everyone is harboring a secret While this book offers a mysterious  edgy chain of events sure to keep you guessing  you re not likely to build a bond with its characters  Each of them are flawed and contribute to a largely heavyhearted plot  But it doesn t seem we re meant to fall in love with this cast  and I don t believe this will hinder your connection to the story  This author s writing is polished  her ideas are well constructed  and she displays powerful themes that do not need the aid of repetition to be recognized or appreciated  The story is told in first person  and alternates between the candid and often morbid perspectives of three women whose lives eventually interlink  I had a hard time putting this book down  A must read for all you psychological thriller lovers   One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl  four for a boy  five for silver  six for gold  seven for a secret never to be told  I ve got a few of those       Book Stats     Genre Category  Mystery Psychological Thriller   Characters  Deeply flawed and deranged    Plot  Suspenseful  edgy  and quick paced   Writing  Engaging and polished   POV  1st Person  Alternates between 3 perspectives   Cliffhanger  None Standalone   HEA   view spoiler  About as happy as this one can get  hide spoiler     This book had such a good PR run  Like it was everywhere  There was so much hype about it  everyone wanted to read it  Me included  I waited a few weeks or so before i decided to buy it and it s really rare i buy a book and read it with a week or two  But figured this would be a quick read  I wasn t wrong  The Girl On The Train is described as the next Gone Girl  Whilst I ve never read that book before  I cant  comment  However it s addictive  It does shout out to be read in one sitting  it s a page turner  It s classed as a thriller  I m unsure if it really is such  It does have the whole drama and suspense in it and mystery but is it scary enough to be a thriller  Probably not The story is told via three different view points Rachel  who is the girl on the train  Megan and also Anna  The characters are so different  one minute they re likeable  the next you can t stand them  They re real  Rachel is just a raving alcoholic  Megan is the girl Rachel views from the train everyday  Anna is the one who got the husband  They re just three totally messed up women who through some crazy times  are brought together in a way they probably never expected  Their lives are turned upside down and they re sad  lonely  crying out for attention  They re just human It wasn t until the last probably 30 odd pages  I really understood what was happening  what brought everyone together  It wasn t what i was expecting either  I think that was a good thing  I like being surprised  I love not guessing halfway through a book at the ending  So well done on that  I didn t love the book and I can t say why because I just don t know  Perhaps because of all the hype  a reader sometimes goes into a book expecting great things  I think it failed on that but I m not sure why  There seemed something missing and I can t say what  It was good  Does the book live upto it s hype  I guess it depends on the reader  I can see this being made into a film though  Rachel  the  girl on the train   is a completely original and unlikely sleuth  Divorced  depressed  alcoholic  and obsessed with her ex husband  she tortures herself with glimpses of her old home and neighborhood as she commutes to and from London by train  Then she becomes convinced she has witnessed something sinister and her fixation shifts from mooning over her ex to solving a crime  As an investigator  she is hampered not only by her complete lack of training  naivete  and emotional involvement  but also by occasional drunken blackouts that make it difficult for her remember the clues she s stumbled upon  Yet  I found Rachel increasingly endearing as she struggles courageously to uncover more than one terrible secret  The narrative shifts between her point of view and that of two other women who are essential to the plot but less interesting as characters  The novel has a few flaws   the final confrontation is a bit too drawn out and melodramatic and the denouement a bit too quick and neat for my taste   but these are minor quibbles  All in all  it s a well told story with an unconventional heroine  Unreliable narrator s are the best kind  I am going to give this one four stars because I couldn t put it down  There were a few things I could get nitpicky about but it isn t worth it  It was interesting and fast paced  and I don t think there is a lot more you can ask for in a thriller  I may be rating The Girl on the Train a bit high  While I wouldn t exactly call it an outstanding work of literature  I am giving it 4 stars based on the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed reading it  There have been quite a few books that I ve read lately that I felt like I was slogging through  so this book was really a welcome change  It was intriguing from the start and had good flow throughout  No slogging whatsoever This book has been compared to Gone Girl quite a bit  and it may be similar in terms of popularity and likelihood of becoming a major motion picture  On the other hand it s quite a bit different in that while there are  twists   it s not  twisted   My only criticism would be that I thought the outcome may have became apparent a tad too early  but other than that  I thought the plot was very well constructed  No good can come from my revealing any more details here  so I ll just say that I would highly recommend this to anyone in the mood for a thrilling  yet quick and easy read  It would be the perfect book to take with you on the plane  Great murder mystery told from various POV and primarily from the view of an unreliable narrator While I can t say that I was completely blindsided by the developments I didn t guess them early and enjoyed every second as they played out before me This will be my suggestion for those asking what book to read on vacation this summer   Compelling and intense  Will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last page  a gripping page turner a la Gone Girl  but better  and set in England   Great read  Disappointed with the ending  Worth reading  The Girl on the Train is a well structured psychological suspense story  It follows three women  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  Megan and Anna live in the same neighborhood abutting a train track  Rachel rides by their homes each day on the train  Their lives are entwined from the start  and when one of the three goes missing  the suspense level ratchets up  Hawkins does a great job of creating flawed characters and revealing their stories in a way that will make you keep reading  There have been a lot of comparisons to Gone Girl  but frankly I thought Gone Girl was more original and had more twists  But The Girl on the Train is well crafted and ultimately satisfying     Hawkins knows how to tell a story  Personally  I didn t think there was anything especially literary about this book  but if you are just looking for a good pleasure read  I d recommend it  Perfect for a vacation  a plane ride  or the beach  For the majority of this book I just kept thinking  I m only going to be able to rate this book as 2 or 3 stars  It had such good reviews that I was expecting it to be amazing from the beginning  It wasn t  For the first 60  of the book I kept debating with myself of whether I should finish it or just give up because I found it rather repetitive and tediously slow  Nothing was particularly happening  Nothing was getting resolved  and there wasn t really anything new happening  But then I hit the 60  mark and it really began to pick up  I read the last section of the book in less than a day  I didn t want to put it down  I loved the ending  the way that it didn t just happen but crept in slowly over the course of the second half  There was always the possibility that it would go that way  but it was slim  So when it did it was both shocking and exciting  For a book that I previously couldn t wait to finish and get it over with  I was suddenly extremely anxious to find out what happened  I was eager to reach the end  I guess  the last 40  is why I bumped my rating up to 4 stars and I have to say that I am pleased that I did decide to persevere and finish this book  unreliable narrator  good building tension  blackouts and foggy memory  jealousy  alcoholism  murder   a good mixture to keep me turning the pages  Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning  Every day she rattles down the track  flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes  and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck  She s even started to feel like she knows them   Jess and Jason   she calls them  Their life  as she sees it  is perfect  Not unlike the life she recently lost And then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough  Now everything s changed  Unable to keep it to herself  Rachel offers what she knows to the police  and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next  as well as in the lives of everyone involved  Has she done more harm than good Compulsively readable  The Girl on the Train is an emotionally immersive  Hitchcockian thriller and an electrifying debut   A mystery that works because of the feverish narration and sheer unpredictability  until about 70  of the book   I would not call it a classic  yet it is an exhilarating one sitting read  I don t know if its because of the setting or a bit of domesticity   but I found a tinge of Sophie Kinsella in this author  Who knew   D 4 5 5When I started reading this book with too many flawed characters  I was not sure if I was going to like this  Rachel s character who is the main narrator seemed to be absolutely horrible and I hated her  But slowly I got pulled into the story and there was no way I could put this book down A great thriller and it is too fast paced that you just get carried the way Paula Hawkins wants you to Full Review here  This book started out slow as hell  Listening to a drunken fat lady staring out of train window didn t seem very enticing  but once she started acting on her fantasies  and no one can create a fantasy world quite like a drunk can    the book picked up pace quickly Sitting with strangers always creates this heavy awkward silence and people are all trying their best to be like rocks and give nothing away and not look at each other  And yet we are all curious about the people next to us and who they are and what they do  So we make stuff up  But     drunken Rachel actually goes and talks to and gets involved with the strangers she makes up fantasies about   Which seemed hilarious and like a train wreck  ugh couldn t help that bad pun  waiting to happen And naturally it did  Everything Rachel could have messed up she did  mainly because she spends her whole life being drunken and confused  plus she got hit on the head countless times    but she was still interesting and compelling  She is trying to figure out what s going on so fervently that as a reader you can t help but cheer her on and speed through the pages so you can find out too   Plus it s always fun to have a slightly unreliable narrator like Rachel  or like the other two female narrators  because they act like normal people and see things their own selfish narrow minded way which adds to the confusion and mystery of the book After this book I    1  Am never going to trust those random people that try to talk to me in supermarkets or gas stations because you never know what nice face could be hiding a cheating lying killer2  Never go on blind dates  same reason as number one 3  Keep my weird fantasies to myself so I don t end up beaten and drunk4  Buy a gun before I confront someone with murder  so I don t end up beaten and drunk   or dead Hahahahaha  But seriously though  Rachel and this book is light years better than Gone Girl  which I didn t like at all   Also I probably should have listened to Carrie Underwood s Black Cadillacs song on repeat while I read this     Have you ever driven by stretches of houses wondering what life was like behind those walls  Now imagine driving past them daily  the stories you can make up in your own mind of the people inside  their lives  even giving them names  What happens when you see something  something that changes how you think of these people  What do you do  What do you do when you don t know who to trust  When everything is lie  or everything is a black hole because you can t bear the reality so you drink away the time  faking the life you live because telling the truth of what really is too hard to face  This book makes you take a look at others  realizing that what you see on the outside isn t always what is  What a page turner  I was constantly wondering and in the dark until the last 50 page or so  I started to think hmm maybe  and it turns out my suspicions were correct  Highly recommend this book  Believe the hype I read this in a few sittings  It was insanely addicting and mysterious  Reminds me a bit of Gillian Flynn who writes flawed  unlikable and bitter females  I love the connections between the characters and even though I guessed the twist  I was never really sure and wanted to keep reading  And it s becoming a movie Starring two of my favorites  Rebecca Ferguson  a Swedish actress who outshone everyone in the last Mission Impossible movie  and Emily Blunt  I have such a celebrity crush on her after The day after tomorrow  SQUEAL  Recommended for those who like mysteries and thrillers with a good dose of drama  I really liked it but not as earth shatteringly good as reviews made me believe   I ve just come back from a holiday in beautiful La Palma  I stayed at the amazing La Palma princess hotel and I was really excited when I saw a bookshelf in reception where people could exchange their books  I had brought 5 books with me  and as there was lots of laying about in the sun  I raced through them  Which means I had a chance to take some from the Bookshelf    I picked this one as you would have to be living under a rock to not notice this book creeping about in book stores  It does live up to the hype  It s really gripping  the way it unfolds  not like I thought it would be at all  We ve all been that girl on the train well a sober version  and wondered about the lives of the people who live along the rail tracks or our fellow commuters  When I used to get the train to college  a girl in red coat used to get on everyday  I always wondered about her and I never even said hello  I ve been Rachel again a sober version  and I ve been Anna so I could sympathize with them both  however two years is way too long to still be depressed about a relationship ending  Get over it girl  Good job Cathy is so nice  as I would have kicked Rachel out ages ago  I wasn t expecting the ending and I loved how everything started falling into place  an awesome book    No Spoilers The Short of It A nosy woman on the train witnesses something odd and decides to look into it further The Rest of It This book is a lot of fun  Lots of page turning  plenty of twists and a classic unreliable narrator  Good stuff Rachel is an alcoholic and has lost her job  She rides the train all day to keep her roommate from knowing that she s now unemployed  Her train happens to pass by the house she once owned with her husband  Tom  Tom is now married to Anna and they live happily in what was once her home  Rachel s train ride through London is often spent tipping a bottle back  Seeing her old home and sometimes even catching a glimpse of the other woman  is enough to make her drink and drink she does  So much so  that what she sees is often not remembered later That memory thing becomes a problem early on Yes  It  Does Rachel s daily observances include a couple that she s come to know as Jess and Jason  names she s made up to give them substance  She watches them interacting on the balcony of their apartment  and she s dreamed up a back story for them  But when Jess does something out of character for her  and then a crime is committed  Rachel takes it upon herself to investigate As you can imagine  things get out of hand  Rachel sticks her nose into their lives and in the process  ends up involving her ex husband and his wife  Both  really want nothing to do with Rachel but out of obligation  aware of Rachel s raging alcoholism  Tom tries to look out for her when he can  which infuriates Anna Tension mounts as the story unfolds and when you get to those last few chapters  you can t help but turn the kids away  let your dinner burn  etc  The ending needs to be read uninterrupted  Don t tell me that I didn t warn you But  honestly  Rachel s antics were a little tiring  Just when I started to grow bored with her  some critical piece of info would surface and then I d be flipping pages again  I suppose that s a sign of true suspense because there was no way I was going to put the book down  I knew that from the start  Does it deserve the hype  Yes  I think so  If you pick it up for pure fun  you will enjoy it quite a bit  If you pick it apart and compare it to other books  you might find fault with some of it but really  who has the time for that Read it  because it s fun and it s a great distraction from all the crap going on in the world today For more reviews  visit my blog  Book Chatter  I saw reviews of this book that were all over the map from  thrilling  stunning   etc   to  I was so disappointed   So I was not sure whether it was worth reading But I read it It s a very interesting book  I really liked the way it was structured  told from the point of view of the women involved with nothing from the men  since most of them were suspects Our narrator is not a very sympathetic character  She is an alcoholic who suffers from blackouts  One of those occurred the night a woman  subsequently found murdered  is abducted and in the same area  Rachel commutes daily to London even though she was fired from her job and makes up stories about a couple she sees nearlyn everyday who live in her old neighborhood  She fantasizes about getting back with her ex husband  who is remarried with a young child  and harrasses him with emails  phone calls and visits to the neighborhood  His wife is frightened of her But Rachel has lovely fantasies about the couple   Jason and Jess she calls them Then one day she sees Jess with another man  who appears to kiss her passionately  When  Jess  disappears  Rachel feels that she needs to contact the police  and eventually  the husband to let them know  She is declared an  unreliable witness  due to her alcoholism and stalking of her ex  But she manages to insert herself into the investigation  It s the first time she feels like not drinking Apparent guilt shifts constantly  especially when her body is found beaten and murdered  Rachel seems to have  memories  of the night Jess disappeared  but they may be  false  memories since she suffered a blackout that night Rachel persists  She visits Jess s former counselor  She visits and is befriended by Jess s husband  until he finds out she DIDN T know Jess and is alcoholic and stating that she knows something about that night even though she was suffering a blackout In spite of her good intentions  Rachel manages to make the investigation more complex than it needs to be  Her convictions switch from the husband  it couldn t be  she thinks  He s not capable   to the  other man  she saw who MUST be guilty The ending is good except for one thing  I m constantly amazed that these killers seem to have to unburden themselves completely to their last  victim   I realize this is the way the author tells us how it happened and I also realize that some killers do unburden themselves but rarely to the extent that fiction killers do  In this book  it seemed especially jarring to me But the killer was unsuspected  And the final resolution was great It s definitely worth reading  Classificacao  4 5 estrelasNao acho que seja o livro ou o thriller do ano  mas e uma boa e rapida leitura   com algumas revelacoes surpreendentes e outras que  bem  se estava mesmo a espera  Rachel is a mess  she is an alcoholic and has lost her husband  Maintaining the pretence to all around her that she still has a job she commutes to London daily  always on the same train  the train that passes behind her old marital home  On the same street  just where the train pauses at a signal  live a young couple and Rachel fantasises about their life together  One day she sees the woman kiss another man and is upset  that weekend the woman disappears  Rachel is concerned about what happened and this is compounded by the fact that Rachel saw the woman on the night she disappeared  Unfortunately Rachel was drunk at the time and can only see a few flashbacks in her memory  What happened to Megan and can Rachel put the pieces together in time I started this book with complete scepticism  comparisons with  Gone Girl  abound and I like my books to have an original twist  Up till halfway through the book I felt it dragging a little  Then something changed  I m not sure what  and this became a nail biting thriller  There are twists aplenty and whilst the ending is neat  it leaves a little bit more  Rachel is not a sympathetic character  there isn t a single one in the book  and that s why it works  In the end this draws on the originality of Gone Girl but takes it to a new place and Hawkins has written with restraint  A deserved popular read  Welcome to the world of messy  alcoholic  lying female narrators whom you cannot trust at all  Rarely have I read a book in recent times that didn t reveal the real stuff up until the last 30 40 pages  It made you turn page after page even though the situations shown in the book were disgusting  When I started reading it  it looked like a rip off of Gone Girl and I thought I d go on hating this book  but it was even creepier than Gone Girl  and that says something and I actually liked this one  The characters are really well created and it keeps you guessing up until the last moment who the real culprit is  The first person narrative with different timelines of each character gave the book a different dimension altogether  For a thriller  the most important thing is to not reveal too much information too early and for a debut author Paula Hawkins did a really good job with this  and kept you glued to the book till the last   This was REALLY hard to put down  uh  it s 4 AM  and I kept wanting to read more and needing to KNOW more  so the author has definitely succeeded in that  It does really drive home the point of the unreliable narrators and  maybe it s just me but  I think it did a good job at keeping things under wraps  However  at some points  I kinda went  well this is clearly meant to be a new Gone Girl clearly this is written to make a good movie  and it will definitely make a good movie   Still  tho  given the fact that I read it all and I couldn t stop reading it  even though it FREAKED ME OUT  I think people should definitely check it out  At first I thought everyone was terrible  Not one of the characters were redeeming in the least  Tom   cheating on his wifeScott   mentally abusiveRachel   an alcoholicMegan   cheating on her husbandAnne   the mistressLooking back over the book  nope  no one was redeemable in the end besides maybe Rachel and Anne  I mean they both were terrible people  but they had been expertly manipulated  Perhaps the reader is manipulated as well  thinking that Rachel is even more terrible than what she actually appears to be  thanks to the words and thoughts of Tom  I d say that even if I hated everyone  there have been few books that have made me turn the page so quickly to find out exactly what happened next  Perhaps I was hoping for a neatly tied up ending that was never going to come  Or perhaps I was surprised  because I thought Anne was manipulated enough to go along with Tom s plan  Surprised that she would drive the  dagger  deeper into the wound  I guess I m just glad it wasn t some weird outside character that committed the crime  Neither the therapist or the old boyfriend were the causes of Megan s death  but she sure was naive   I will start by saying that this is a well written book   My only complaint is that the main character is an alcoholic and the reader spends a lot of time watching her drink  cry in her gin and regret it the next day  In defense of the character I believe the author has caught the life of an addict quite well  But  it isn t my favorite type of reading That being said  this book is a good mystery with a bit of thriller thrown in to the mix  Rachael is the girl on the train  She rides the train every day into the city and every day she rides it home again  The train she takes passes the house where she used to live before her husband left her for another woman  As she rides the train  she has noticed the couple who lives in the house a few doors down and has started creating a fantasy life around them Every day on the train  Rachael has several Gin and Tonics and several more on the way home  Then a few more when she gets home from the bottle she hides in her room  She is beginning to have black outs and forget what she has done while she has blacked out  Often  she calls her ex husband and cries on his shoulder or alternately she screams at him  His wife  has had enough of Rachael and wants her out of their lives One day Rachael notices that the woman in her perfect couple is kissing another man on the patio where she habitually sees them as she passes by on the train and this begins to shatter her fantasy about this couple  Then the woman disappears  Rachael tells the police what she has seen and what she thinks she knows  but they dismiss her as an unreliable witness once they investigate her background The story is told in three voices Rachael  Anna and Meghan  Anna is the woman who stole Rachael s husband away  Meghan is the woman from the balcony  As each woman tells their story  the story of who is killed and why is slowly unfolded  The story of Rachael trying to unravel the truth behind the death  and her part in it  becomes clear This story delves deeply into the lives of three very different women and the problems that are troubling them as they live what appears to be very normal lives  The layers are slowly peeled back and as the depths are revealed  so are the secrets that each of the women are hiding  When all the secrets have been revealed  it is clear who the killer is and why murder was the option chosen to deal with the problem This story deals with adult themes and situations that people find themselves in when their lives begin to spin out of control  An interesting read and a good story  This book had way too much narration with lots of telling instead of showing but it was nonetheless compelling enough to keep me going for a quick read  We spend the time in the heads of three very flawed major characters  Rachel  Anna and Megan with the main one being the alcoholic Rachel She is quite an annoying character in many ways  In fact  no one in here is particularly sympathetic which in a way made it easier to enjoy the storyline  You re almost guaranteed a good ending no matter how it turned out  Still  you end wanting to know what happened to all of them on that July day in 2013  The results of course  is not really all that surprising but ended up being a good albeit simple yarn   Very suspenseful  The characters are not to be trusted and I suspected each of them at one point or another  Just when I thought I had it figured out  something happened to make me suspect someone else and that s how I like it  This book is often compared to Gone Girl  but other than the suspense and the characters having issues that make them seem untrustworthy  I don t really see the comparison  But I liked it on its own and would recommend it to fans of psychological thrillers   Extremely clever and really well paced  Proof that a thriller doesn t need one large  Wow  moment  but rather a bunch of smaller twists  in order to be unputdownable  Best of all  there is a point toward the middle of this book where I realized I did not trust a single character  Everyone in this book seems guilty  when you look at them from the right light  A haunting tale of three women  three men   one treacherous and deceitful  multiple narratives ingeniously spliced together and told via the vantage point of a train  Ms  Hawkins  exquisite prose breathes life and a myriad of emotions into each inner dialogue and casts a spell of inquisitive suspense and wonder within the reader  The conclusion was predictable and that drops my rating from five stars to four and half  One point I found fascinating is the author manages to convey how frequently we gaze at other people s lives with secret longing and hidden envy  but the reality is that we all have private  dark areas and life is never what it seems to someone else  I loved this  Enjoyed the hell out of this book  even while it was freaking me out  The characters are complex and all vaguely unlikable  which is a nice change from the Mary Sue s I ve been getting in a lot of other books  There s enough humanity in them to make them if not sympathetic  then logically cohesive  The AHA plot moment was a little Plot Ex Machina for me  but thinking back there was some foreshadowing that I could have paid more attention to  While I nothing d the format  kind of clever  a little tedious   I really liked the writing style  Looking forward to future books by this author  hopefully  Great read  About 20  to go and will not sleep until I know who killed Megan   Started reading late last night and spent most of today reading     Riveting  Wow  This book was quite a ride  I literally struggled to put it down at bedtime and spent the whole next day finishing  The only reason I knocked off a star was that the climactic ending felt a bit contrived  I certainly hope the identity of the killer was not meant to be a surprise  but I definitely enjoyed Rachel s character  the suspense was excellently crafted and the pacing was spot on  Very impressive for a debut   Opiniao completa  aqui http   pedacinho literario blogspot c    Observa  As casas  As

viewed from a women who lost pretty much everything in her life  Rachel the main character in the book  is a women who takes the train around London every morning  She soon started becoming an alcoholic after her ex husband Tom left her  Now she just travels around London  usually passing by her old house  and neighborhood  She stares at the people and the couples  However  it was specifically one couple she paid attention to  Their names were Jess and Jason  the perfect couple that Megan had once been apart  and now dreamed about  However the couple wasn t as perfect as she thought they were  There real names were Megan and Scott  and now Megan was missing  Now Rachel gets right in the middle of the investigation  What she gets involved in though is much darker and scarier then what she actually thought was real  People who enjoy books about people getting past illusions  and finding about he truth will enjoy this book  3 5 StarsThe Girl on the Train was a good read for the most part  I was quickly hooked with the plot and how the story is told from the perspective of three characters  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  The only thing is  none of the three narrators can be trusted  I thought that was very clever from Paula Hawkins  Reading this book I wanted to root for Rachel  the girl on the train  but as an alcoholic she just kept making bad choice after bad choice and that s how the whole story becomes a tangled up mess  This type of mystery plot made me think of Gone Girl and Dark Places  In fact  I became excited thinking it was going to be that type of book with several  twists in the plot  and guessing the  who did it   However  that was my problem with this book and the fact that I figured it out a bit soon  I kept hoping to be wrong and have another twist in the story  but I was right and that made the story feel a bit flat at the end  Overall  I think it was a good  entertaining book  Seru  Novel ini membuat pembaca menebak menebak  Paula Hawkins pandai memainkan skenario dan alur yang bikin greget  Semakin tipis sisa halaman yang belum terbaca  makin menarik  Dibutuhkan konsentrasi membaca yang lebih untuk novel ini karena harus memperhatikan setting waktu dalam cerita   A riveting masterpiece that has been carefully plotted and written with all the right details to keep you from putting the book down till the very end  One of the best thrillers I ve read   I wish I hadn t guessed whodunnit less than a quarter of the way through  or rather  that my guess hadn t been validated  but oh  what a wonderful cast of entirely unlikeable  messed up  falling apart  disastrous characters nonetheless  And what a wonderful plot of jerked around suspicions and pieced together interactions  My only complaints regard a few issues surrounding the ending  but the rest is so good  so much fun  that it s more than worth picking up  and then being unable to put down  This book was a good thriller to read  I have to admit  I was looking all over for clues and I still missed them  I didn t figure out who was the culprit till nearly the end Rachel was an EXTEMELY hard character to warm too  She was depressing but I am glad the author gradually unfolded her past to show where she came from  I wish we had more in depth review of Tom but still what a fun book to read I highly recommend for lazy rainy afternoons in fall and maybe some summer reading  Good  well paced mystery  In the genre of Gone Girl in that there aren t many likable characters but you don t mind because the story is moving along  I enjoyed reading this but I like a good mystery  All of the characters are flawed  but I m more than o k  with that  It s a fast read  enjoy  I won t tell you what the book was about  but I will tell you how it makes you feel  No spoilers here  My Review  How do you trust the story of an unemployed  forgetful  obsessed alcoholic  You don t  You stare at her  judge her and then walk away  A New York Times Bestseller  The Girl on the Train is nothing short of a breathtaking journey into the human mind  it s snap judgements  and people in general  The story revolves around Rachel  a jobless  divorced  alcoholic living with a roommate  The story involves Rachel  Megan  Anna and Tom  The other characters  as vital as the aforementioned  just flow in and out of the story   in perfect rhythm of a pro knitter  Rachel takes the same train to work every day  She obsesses over the same houses every day  She dreams up a life for the tenants of that house  She imagines what their life would be like  She knows that it s just her imagination but her imagination is the only thing nowadays that keeps her going  Then one day  something changes  Something is off  She knows it  she reports it and she tries to face it  Before she knows it  her memories are failing her and her heart is swaying her  She is caught between her imagination  her reality and her memory  She confronts them  despite her better judgement and for the first time  her imagination and her reality collide in a way she never saw coming  Her present emotions and past actions make for a saucy story and a terrible life  The characters are relatable and despicable at once  Hawkins has boldly merged the lined between good and bad and dances carefully on the little chasm in between  The reader is never fully sure of what to think or how to feel  Hawkins keeps you wondering  hoping and yet double guessing yourself   The Girl on the Train is a fast paced  well written  beautifully developed book  It leaves you with an uneasy happiness and a relaxed sigh  Throughout the book  you are evoked and provoked and yet calmed  The characters are real   they are ugly  they are mean and yet  they are beautiful The portrayal of the human mind and desire is so raw  it leaves you struggling to find peace except till the very end  The Deets  Publisher  Riverhead BooksAuthor   Paula HawkinsPages  336Where you can buy it   Please check out your local bookstore  Local bookstores are absolutely the best and they need all the book lover lovin  they can get  So I didn t quite drink the kool aid on this one  I thought it was a good book  I wanted to know what happened  and unlike many of you I did NOT guess who the villain was right away   I m sorry  Camille  I could have seen it going in different ways  I guess I m not as smart as you are       I also enjoyed that I didn t really like the characters for a lot of the book  Rachel  Get yourself together  girl  It felt sort of realistic  I mean  would you like Rachel in real life  Even if you were close to her  she would probably drive you insane  But I have to admit I don t quite understand the huge amount of hype   I generally stick to YA  but I was pleasantly surprised with this one  I wasn t sure at first if I would like it switching between the different perspectives  but in the end I actually really enjoyed it  If one got too long  or dull it was ok because another perspective would pop up in a second  I would definitely recommend this book  Oh  and this was the first time in a while I didn t see the plot twist coming  I totally thought it was one person throughout the entire book until right about the time they said it was another  Awesome   Moments on a moving train  You re sitting quietly  anonymously  Life out the window flashes by in an instant  in segments    scenery  sunlight  shadow  flash  flash  changing fast  continuous movement  continuous change  with heavy clicks of wheels on track  This is what I feel  what I see when I read The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  In those moments you witness time and life at 50 mph  Going too fast to know if there s more behind the glimpse  Your perception influenced by what you want to envision  what you like seeing outside  But you witness something bad in a quick out your window  Then you think you know something even worse  Now you re able to step off the train and delve deep into the mystery  Reality may be a whole different story  Your keen perception  off  You think you know  But now you don t  Maybe it s best to remain anonymous   No way  You re too far gone  Now that you re either entirely intrigued  or slightly confused  read this fun thriller  It s really  really good  And it s been a long time since I ve read a book I couldn t put down  We all loved it   4 out of 5 stars from each one of the Mindful Readers Like a creepy  paranoid and atmospheric Hitchcock thriller leached onto the written page  elements of Rear Window come to mind   Deeply flawed characters struggling to carry on in an environment where troubled pasts  chronic lies and bad choices predominate  everything is uncertain and nothing is quite what it seems  Do you think you know  or can imagine  how other people live their lives  Ms  Hawkins  view of the world suggests quite the opposite   that we can really never know what is percolating behind our neighbors  closed doors or under their skins  And based on these characters we probably don t want to know  Her story is more than a routine mystery who done it  it is interesting  psychologically nuanced  well plotted and a compelling read  2am  way too late to start a book  So I thought I ll just read the first fifty pages  So I thought 4am  let me just finish this chapter  So I thought Oh 7am   time to walk my dog already 8am   I can finally sleep  After I write this review  of course  HahahaThis was such a quick action packed read  Loved it  Though I have to agree with some people who say  the ending fell a bit short  The rest of the story was great so I ll let it slide  The author had me guessing like crazy  I kept switching culprits  It was even better than the main narrator was so unreliable  made me think a bit harder  Can t say the reveal was as shocking as I would ve like  but my heart was racing so  that s a good sign as any in my book  The format was a little contrived  but overall compelling narrative  Several unrealistic plot turns  and you just wanted to sold each of the three narrators to shape up emotionally  they were all damaged and self destructive  good story  although it dragged in parts  So many unlike able characters  you think any one of then could have  done it   Some parts are still kind of vague to me  though   It s one of those books that you have to work at reading  but  I liked it  Finished this in one sitting Extremely captivating  thrilling and suspenseful These characters that are introduced to the readers are fleshed out  exposing every emotion and deceit that a human can be capable of A recommend for lovers of suspense  and thrillers set within a marriage type setting  I absolutely loved the motif of the trains   added to the perfectness of it   Wow  This book takes you through the screwed up lives of the main characters  while allowing you to be sympathetic to their situations they have placed themselves in  I loved it and love the ending I truly did not see coming  Vorweg vielleicht eins   das Buch wird oft als Thriller oder Krimi gehandelt  das ist es aus meiner Sicht nicht  Es ist ein toller Roman  der vor allem durch die  zugegebenermassen kaputten und leider auch unsympathischen  Charaktere glanzt und der eher ein Psychodrama oder eine Charakterstudie darstellt  Und liest man das Buch aus dieser Sicht  finde ich es richtig gelungen Das Buch ist aus Sicht dreier verschiedener Frauen geschrieben  die jeweils als Ich Erzahlerin auftreten und ihre Sicht verschiedener Dinge schildern  Zunachst fand ich das verwirrend  doch nach und nach wird klar  wie die verschiedenen Personen miteinander verbunden sind  Jedem Kapitel ist aber vorangestellt  aus wessen Sicht gerade geschildert wird  so dass eigentlich keine Verwechslungen auftreten konnen  zumal auch die Erzahlweisen der drei Frauen ganz unterschiedlich war  Schwierig fand ich nur die Zeitsprunge   wahrend Rachel und Anna immer ihre Eindrucke aus aktueller Sicht schildern  liegen das  was Megan zu sagen hat  in der Vergangenheit  ein paar Monate vor den aktuellen Ereignissen Der Einstieg in die Geschichte ist zugegebenermassen gemachlich und richtig spannend wird es erst nach ca  100 Seiten  Dennoch aber hat mir auch der Anfang gefallen  weil er Moglichkeit gibt  Rachel kennenzulernen und sich auf sie einzulassen  Sie ist mir zwar nicht sympathisch  dennoch aber fand ich ihre Gedanken und Gefuhle interessant und ihren Charakter einfach wunderbar ausgearbeitet  Sie treibt durchs Leben  gibt sich dem Alkohol hin  warum  erfahrt man im Lauf der Geschichte  und scheitert immer wieder an der Aufgabe  endlich die Finger von ihm zu lassen  Auch ihr Handeln wird deutlich vom Alkohol bestimmt  und so konnte ich vieles einfach nicht nachvollziehen  Trotzdem aber habe ich ihre Abschnitte immer gerne gelesen  ihre Verzweiflung gespurt und letztlich auch ihren   wenn auch versteckten   Lebenswillen  Auch die anderen Charaktere sind sehr gut gezeichnet  wobei es neben den beiden anderen erzahlenden Frauen Megan und Anna auch noch deren Ehemanner und eine Mitbewohnerin von Rachel gibt  Sympathisch ist mir keiner der Figuren  aber sie sind sehr lebensnah und echt  sie wirken mit ihren Problemen authentisch  und alle kann ich mir so oder ahnlich tatsachlich auch vorstellen Toll fand ich vor allem  dass die Geschichte gar nicht mehr Personen braucht  um trotzdem zu fesseln  Es ist eher eine subtile  untergrundige Spannung  die mich gepackt hat und mich das Buch hat in kurzer Zeit verschlingen lassen  und auch wenn das Ende vielleicht vorhersehbar war  fand ich es doch schlussig und glaubhaft  An der einen oder anderen Stelle war mir die Geschichte etwas zu lang gezogen  denn Rachels Gedanken wiederholen sich  dadurch aber wird ihre Not noch mal deutlicher und trotz dieser Langen hatte die Geschichte auf mich eine Sogwirkung  Vielleicht aber auch  weil mich der Schreibstil total uberzeugt hat   ich fand ihn nicht nur angenehm zu lesen  sondern sehr eindringlich und den Punkt genau treffend  Er hat eine dustere Atmosphare geschaffen und die verzweifelte Grundstimmung aller Beteiligten wunderbar transportiert   kurz gesagt  mich hat er gefangen genommen und richtig in die Geschichte gezogen Mein FazitWer einen Thriller oder einen Krimi erwartet  der wird wahrscheinlich enttauscht sein von dieser Geschichte  denn der Roman gleicht eher einem Psychodrama oder einer Charakterstudie  Und als solches ist er wirklich gelungen  Die Charaktere sind fantastisch gestaltet  sehr authentisch und glaubhaft  die Geschichte ist eher untergrundig spannend und der Schreibstil durch seine Eindringlichkeit sehr fesselnd  Mir hat das Buch sehr gut gefallen   einen Stern ziehe ich nur ab  da es durch einige Gedankenwiederholungen doch zu wenigen Langen gekommen ist  Trotzdem hat mich   Girl on the train  sehr gut unterhalten und verdient von mir 4 5 Sternen   The Girl on the Train is a tense thriller about a missing woman  told by multiple narrators in a non linear arrangement  It might sound like Gone Girl  and has been heavily compared to it  but the comparison does both a disservice The most prominent narrator is Rachel Watson  an infertile alcoholic who has been divorced and fired and is staying with a university friend while pretending to put her life back together  She is the titular girl on the train  and while pretending to go to work each day she looks longingly at the street she used to live in  fantasting about a perfect couple she often sees  The other narrators are Anna  her husband s new wife who lives in the same house as they used to  and Megan  one half of Rachel s perfect girl and the one who goes missing Megan s disappearance draws Rachel into their lives  having observed them from the train for some time  She believes she has information that might help  Soon  the three households become rapidly entwined in each other s dramas None of the characters are immediately likeable  but it s hard not to feel sorry for Rachel  She may be her own worst enemy  but it wouldn t do her any harm to catch a break  Hawkins does well to maintain such a tight cast  keeping a very small core of characters central to all of the action  They all have backstories  all have secrets and are all very carefully devised  though none of them have any particularly distinct personality There are some surprises in store along the way  though the pace is sluggish in parts and the ending isn t particularly difficult to predict  The Girl on the Train instead provides some compelling character drama  this is a real study in how people affect each other  the impact that one life has on another  and how each person is the sum of their history  It traces the butterfly effect of relationships and lies There may be some delays  but The Girl on the Train is well worth the ride  Thrillers aren t my favorite  but this one was super well done  Even though the main character frustrated me for a long time  I still couldn t put it down  It all paid off in the end  loved the final twists  I listened to  The Girl on the Train   by Paula Hawkins as I have been repeatedly told to give it a try  Set in the London suburban outskirts  and propelled through the story by way of a commuter train  this psychological thriller jumps forwards and backwards  interspersing points of view  Three women tell one story   a whodunit  Rachel is the broken woman on the train who is forced to roll by her old life every day  She s an alcoholic and still obsessing on her ex husband Anna is the young wife and mother who stole herself a husband  and now misses her days as a mistress  Megan is the seemingly perfect wife on the balcony with the carefree appearance and the handsome husband  but she hides secrets and yearns to run away  It was a fresh story  quite a feat in the age of  Gone Girl   with remarkable pacing and tension  but also an amazing audiobook with fantastic narrators I highly recommend the story  and will add   listen to it if you can As far as debut authors go  Paula Hawkins is one to watch  This is the first book of fiction I have read in 20 years  I am told that reading only nonfiction makes a person less interesting  so not wanting to risk it  I picked this book up  The author tells the story through the words of three narrators  Rachel  Megan and Anna  Rachel is a scorned  hard drinking  unemployed woman who displaces her pain over the loss of her husband  Tom  to another woman  Anna   by regularly riding a train to and from her rented suburban apartment to London  she gives anyone who knows her the impression that she is going to work each day even though she was fired because of her excessive drinking  She fantasizes over a particular house on the route and makes up names for the occupants she perceives to be leading the ideal life as husband and wife  a life she used to have  One day  she sees a man at this house  embracing the women who isn t her husband  Later  she finds out the woman  her real name is Megan  turns up missing and her real husband  Scott  becomes a suspect  Her ex lives next door  not a fantasy  with Anna  The crux of the mystery turns on Rachel s ability to recall details in spite of her alcohol induced stupors  her lack of credibility  and about four suspects  all who had the motive and opportunity to kill Megan  There are ample trysts  sexual scenes  and twists in the book making it exciting  I recommend this book   The main character  Rachel Watson  is so pathetic and unlikable that sometimes you feel disencouraged to keep reading  and give up on the story  That would be a big mistake  Once you get into reading it s hard to stop Rachel is the girl on the train  passenger on a daily  one hour train into London from its suburbs  On the way  the train often stops for several minutes near Rachel s old house  where she lived for a period of time and happily with her then husband Tom  From her train window  she looks into the backyards  houses and windows of her former neighborhood From the train window  she sees the lives of middle class families  and it s a daily reminder of her own let downs  She s in her 30s  divorced  childless  lonely and arguably an alcoholic  She has not a soul she is close to  She just lives  Her self destructive life revolves around sadness and jealousy  especially of her ex husband s new life  She suffers from drunken blackouts and moments of weakness that leave her confused and feeling guilty  though she s not sure of what  Not going to lie to you  I gasped and screamed out loud at sections  Very entertaining  You don t need to be on a train whilst reading  but there were times when I was on a train and it gave it a lil  somethin  somethin  extra  A real page turner  kept me guessing for the guts of two days till I d finished  my friend leant me this one for my holiday and I couldn t put it down  cleverly written and cleverly designed in its delivery  A really good compelling story with some really unlikable characters  Rachel was a divorced alcoholic woman who takes the train from the suburbs to downtown London and stares out the window and imagines the life of the people that live in the houses along the tracks  She envisions the life of one particular home and is devastated that the wife in this house is having an affair  And did I mention that her ex husband and his new wife and child live a few doors down also along the tracks  When the wife disappears  Rachel becomes involved  The book is told from 3 narrator perspectives  Rachel  the main character  Megan  the wife who disappears  and Ana  the new wife of Tom  Rachel s ex and Megan s neighbor    I won this in a Goodreads giveaway Rachel  The ex wife  still trying to get over Tom  She s an alcoholic whose life is in shambles  I don t like her because of her lies  especially when she tells her roommate Cathy that she s trying to get better and going to AA  She rides the train into London every day  passing behind her old house in the process Anna  The current wife  with some paranoid issues  I don t like her because she never cared she was a homewrecker  didn t care when she broke up Rachel and Tom s marriage  especially with her pregnancy   and will immediately jump to assumptions when she s told something bad about someone Megan  A woman Rachel sees from the train  who lives with her husband Scott just a few doors down from where Rachel used to live  and where Tom   Anna currently are   I don t like her because she s a cheater and a liar  but her background shows that she has some psychological issues  I don t sympathize  especially when she takes advantage of help she receives The story focuses around the three women s points of views and how their lives end up entwined I don t like Scott because he s emotionally abusive by constantly checking in on Anna and being distrustful I don t like Tom because he s a cheat and a liar and a sneak I don t like the psychologist Abdic because he gets with his client and seems to be a creep Basically  all of the characters irritated me and yet I did not want to stop reading  I didn t want to work so I could finish the book  I don t know what to give it  It was great and kept everyone guessing and the characters encountered new people and situations  But I really couldn t tolerate the characters   view spoiler  Except Abdic  because everyone makes mistakes and his he stopped  hide spoiler    Maybe Rachel  in the end  I enjoyed this book  It kept my attention and was fast paced  I thought the characters were all very interesting and intriguing  Unlike many people I did not think all of the characters were horrible people  I did not care for Tom  Anna  or Scott but Rachel and Megan had some very real flaws and insights into being a human being  Where they are hot mess  Yes  Are many people hot messes  Yes  It s part of being human  We got a view into what they were thinking    they didn t always act on it    although often they did  But their thoughts were very real I would recommend   I really enjoyed this book  but I can t say I LOVED it because the characters are so absolutely unlikeable  All of them  There s not a single character I could stand  Rachel especially drives me insane  The whinging and crying and self loathing is just grating  Add the poor decisions and complete lack of self control and you spend half the book wanting the murderer to kill HER  Ha  That said  it was a great whodunnit with lots of twists and turns  I can see the comparisons to Gone Girl  Read and enjoyed that one too  and had equal disdain for those characters   I wasn t going to post a review until I saw not only the number of one star reviews  but also snarks about how this is only something people who don t read like  Er  no  I read LOTS  I also read enough to be able to differentiate between something I dislike and something  badly written   It s not that either It s not without its flaws  I think more description would have enriched it  The few descriptive passages there are  mostly skies  show she can write them well enough  It s possible that she didn t want to pull  the camera  back   reading the book was like watching a film where all the shots are up close and intimate However  considering how I normally avoid first person present  especially FPP from multiple POVs  I read it in one sitting  And after reading the one star reviews  I gave more thought to the book s appeal The difference  I think  is the degree of self awareness the writer   characters have about how nuts they are  In many novels  that I put down early on  the main character is often just as crazy  but the author presents their terrible behavior as normal and perfectly acceptable  In those  you re supposed to believe accept that the MC rages on people  is incredibly self centered or mentally unstable  but it s all good  she s normal and the characters in her world love her regardless  They re like those relatives you always want to escape from but they make you feel like you re the one who s mad  Normally those characters are Anna  only you re expected to root for them Here  the author knows her main characters are messed up  the characters  behaviour is appalling  what they do isn t okay  Nor is it considered acceptable by other characters  Yet they are still relatable and even sympathetic  She crawled right up inside their heads to show their world as they experience it The book isn t perfect  I can see why people dislike it  but it isn t a one star book  You get what you sign up for with this one     The first half read so much like a  Gone Girl  copycat that I was a teensy bit annoyed  A couple that looks perfect on the outside but may have secrets no one knows  a missing wife  a husband acting oddly and suspected for her disappearance  And all told through alternating chapters told from two different viewpoints  Except that one viewpoint is the missing wife  and one is just a commuter on a train who saw more than she was supposed to and happened to get involved  So in that last detail it diverged from  Gone Girl   And then I hit a point when a third person s narrative entered the book  And from then things starting getting interesting  and the plot went off the rails  in a good way  and pun intended   I found myself hurrying through the second half because I was dying to find out whodunnit  And when the big reveal began  I was actually really nervous and excited and a little scared  So I m pretty pleased with how this book ultimately took on a life of its own  Definitely thrilling  Oh wow  what a crazy ride  This book was good at keeping me glued to the pages  Paula Hawkins is a master storyteller  She unfolds it carefully  slowly revealing pieces of the characters in her telling  Really  it was quite an entertaining read  I moved through such a range of emotions  theories  understandings    always wanting to turn the page to see what comes next  What will happen now  All of the characters are complex beings  and we are given a view of their lives just so Addictive  Hooked to the very end  Hawkins is such a manipulator  Not even my usual read  but I highly recommend  I did not enjoy reading this book  and yet I found it extremely compelling  The author has clearly mastered the use of unreliable narrators  I also appreciated the decidedly unglamorous portrayal of alcoholism  Finally  the ending was tidy and satisfying  and not a drawn out hot mess  unlike Gone Girl  to which it is frequently compared   I get it why this book is NYT bestseller  The story flows nicely and  for the most part  it reads like a really good movie script  The first 40  of the story was slow  but didn t drag  If it makes sense  Not a lot happened  aside from endless train trips back and forward and tons of foggy drunken episodes  which at the time felt insignificant  but were later explained very well  I thought that the author used a lot of space to set the tone and introduce all the characters  Too much for my personal liking  but as I said  it wasn t boring  The reason I m taking away one star is because of one character  who was added for a sole reason to throw a reader of tracks and nothing else  The person kept being mentioned and I was sure that he will play a significant role  but he didn t  The truth was revealed and I thought  What was the point of having him in the story at all  The book was great  I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a well written psychological thriller   This novel was intriguing at the beginning  though a little confusing until the characters were more readily defined  It was compelling after a few chapters and the changing narrative told by Rachel  Anna and Megan was enthralling  It certainly was a page turner and the varied viewpoints meant the narration was always interesting  I found myself reading large sections without even realising  Really enjoyed this book  Great mystery and fascinating characters  Hawkins wrote a main character that I couldn t help but root for even as she was basically destroying her own life  Also genuinely scary at some parts  My heart was racing  It had a good  realistic resolution and tied everything up nicely in the end  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries that are character driven and less procedural   Glad that s over  I m exhausted  I really enjoyed the book  Characters were true to life and Rachel s anguish with her drinking problem resonated with me  recovering alcoholic w  25  years of sobriety   The  twist  at the end is not so much startling as it is sudden  But  the Rashomon style story telling lent a lot to overall suspense and anxiety  Comparisons to Gone Girl are unfair to both authors and to potential readers  This stands on its own and does not any lazy marketing comparisons  Creepy  eerie  and suspenseful  Bet this would make a good movie  Very entertaining  What an exciting read  I had been wanting to find an exhilarating thriller like this one for months  and I enjoyed the huge amounts of drama and suspense in it greatly  The only reason why I rate it with four stars instead of five is because the ending didn t take me by surprise at all  I kind of knew the whole time what was about to happen  Leaving that aside  I still think this is a great book for thriller fans  a story where there are no innocent lambs or pitiful victims  where everybody has something to hide and the reader has to decide who to trust more  an alcoholic  a compulsive cheat  or an expert liar  Looking forward to reading more by Paula Hawkings  Uma trama que prende do principio ao fim mas a meu ver com um final que podia ser melhor  I enjoyed this story being told from multiple perspectives  It s lack of overt plot twists kept you guessing and showcased how things are not always as they appear in the lives of those we observe around us  Good and fast read  Not a massive reader or fan of thrillers but I felt this one really worked   Maybe it s because I m a commuter but the starting point of lives glimpsed everyday had me gripped    lots of twists and turns  Not a challenging read but a very enjoyable one   Kalogrammeno  gregoro kai anatreptiko  me ploke pou sou kobei ten anasa kai se kanei na thes na to katabrokhthiseis monomias   I really liked it and could see what all the hype was about  Beyond that I don t have much to say about it This shit is so good  Fans of Gillian Flynn will like the fast paced nature of this book  A real page turner that hooks you in right from the start  Thrilling and mysterious  the Rachel s unreliable narration keeps the reader guessing all the way through until the very last page  I have been pleasantly surprised because i did not see this happening  I did kinda like the book   its in the same category as Gone Girl  but it s not as well plotted  The authors attempts at misdirection earlier on seem very clumsy  I never bought the first suspect as the actual killer   so I really thought that he she was going to BE the actual killer which would have been a surprise  But alas  no such luck  That said  I had scenarios in my head where at least two people could have been the killer so I was still kept guessing till the reveal  As a people watcher myself I did enjoy the first bit where Rachel is speculating about Megan s perfect life   very relatable   really good  fast read  kept me guessing  This is one of those books where I don t really like any of the characters  yet  I couldn t put the book down  All the characters have flaws  This  to me  makes them ring true as human beings  Recommend A brilliantly crafted mysteryTwo increasingly common features of our age novels are chronological jangling of the narration and a story told through the mingling of perspectives of multiple characters  The author s use of these tricks is not new but unlikely in many other books  these tools are not used to exhibit the creator s smartness  Rather they truly add to the charm of the story without appearing artificial The fast paced book seems to start extremely simplistically  The author seamlessly infuses ever higher levels of complexity through straightforward events  To a degree  the mystery itself is not that masterful  but its bundling and then unraveling are  Readers are barely acquainted with the unusual setup and the big event sneaks up from nowhere  All the characters are  designed  credibly normal as well as adequately quirky  The same is true about interactions that are short  relevant and that help in pushing the story ahead all the time The climax is stretched by the standards set by the rest of the novel  However  it does not take away a great debut novel  Man was this a quick read  It was fresh  different  not Gone Girl II  no way  it was unique  and the words flowed nicely  I was a little disappointed that I saw the ending coming and that it was revealed  both a few pages too soon  but not too disappointed  Hawkins developed strong characters  none of them likable  Did this on in audio and the three narrators are fantastic  Megan  Rachel and Anna each get their own narrator and they portrayed each woman so well  Their voices for the men were done well too  They truly enhanced my reading experience Engaging story as well  Depressing  but intriguing  I really liked it  Enjoyed this  3 5 4 stars  Definitely a page turner  Some very spooky imagery  And I thought author handled the unreliable narrator theme deftly  Book club tomorrow night    4 5 stars  Yep  you guys should read this  I felt a little anxious reading this as it is a psychological thriller  Felt a little like Gone Girl in its weirdness  Really enjoyed this one  I almost didn t read it because of the comparison to Gone Girl  I m not typically a fan of stories with unreliable narrators and I thought Gone Girl was ok  but not worth the hype at all  I think this story is better  I didn t feel like I had been lied to for the whole story  In my opinion  the comparison to Gone Girl does this novel a disservice  It is a good book on its own  Without giving much away  the main narrator is an alcoholic  You are told this at the beginning of the book  so no  it is not really a spoiler  I was frustrated with her throughout much of the book  She makes terrible choices  even when she is sober  I wanted to reach into the book at times and snap her out of it and shout at her  It was frustrating  There are two other narrators in the book  both are very flawed women that I could not really relate to  but I enjoyed hearing their perspectives  They rounded out the story well  but were not likable  To be honest  there wasn t a character in the book that I d want to hang out with The ending    yes  you most likely know who done it before the end  but it was still good  More bad decisions ensue  but you wonder how many options the main character had at that point  I liked the way the very end was done  where they tie up the loose ends  It wasn t a neat little bow  but felt a bit more realistic  So  I don t generally care for stories with unlikable characters or unreliable narrators  I was frustrated with the decisions that the characters made and I knew who done it before the end  Yet  this story was interesting enough that I could overlook those things and still enjoy the book  At the end of the book  I was left with the  what a good book  feeling and that s what I m rating this book on  I would definitely recommend this book to people that are considering it  Be prepared to be frustrated and enjoy it   I actually read this in just over one day  Pleasantly surprised that Paula Hawkins kept me guessing right up until the end  even my husband remarked on the fact that I hadn t sussed it all out well before the end   Damaged characters galore and convoluted lives that are tangled and crisscross every which way  I found myself feeling a certain way towards various characters only to have those feelings change dramatically as the book moved along  Great sense of forward motion that made putting the book down difficult  I kept telling myself I would read just one more chapter and put the book down  Clearly  I did a lot more reading than putting down  If you re looking for a quick moving engaging suspenseful mystery of tangled human lives   this book is the one to pick up  The Girl on the Train is a page turner of a thriller that mostly earns the advance buzz that surrounds it  What makes the book work is Hawkins  choice to build the narrative around Rachel Watson  As a narrator Rachel is simultaneously repulsive    a divorced  unemployed alcoholic who even she knows is hell to live with    and sympathetic  To fill her days  and hide her lack of a job from her flatmate  she travels to and from her home to London on a train that passes the back garden of the house she shared with her ex husband  She fill her nights with drinking to the point of blacking out and drunk dialing or emailing her former spouse  enraging him and scaring his new wife On her train trips Rachel concocts idealized fantasies about a couple living several doors aways from her former house  Her obsession leads her to meddle when the young woman goes missing  just days after Rachel spied her kissing a man not her husband  Her pursuit of the truth is neither graceful  nor gracefully received  Her drinking is persistent  even though she knows it s self destructive  dangerous and earns her the contempt of nearly everyone she encounters Hawkins cleverly intersperses Rachels tragic perspective with that of Megan  the young wife who has vanished  and that of Anna  her former husband s new wife  As a chorus these three women each have a part to play  Even with the richness that comes from these other voices  it s Rachel s story and character that are central  The novel s propulsive momentum comes not from who is the culprit    I sussed that out quickly and I m sure many others will as well    but in the inept  and very nearly tragic amateur detecting that Rachel engages in  even as her newfound quest provides a glimmer of hope that she might be stronger than the demons that plague her  The suspense is whether or not she will learn the truth about herself before she is destroyed by drink or violence  An excellent character driven read for a cold winter night  The Girl On The Train was the first of this genre I have ever read  It wasn t the sort of stuff I usually read   generally my to read list is filled with fantasies and kiddish adventure novels  But this  It was in every sense of the word a THRILLER  it had me guessing and second guessing every thing  We have three narrators   Rachel  Megan and Anna  They are so messed up   a drunk  a liar and a cheat  These women are so immoral and they do such stuff that if you hear about it  you would despise each and every one of them  But since the novel is in first person  I couldn t help but pity the three  After reading a couple of pages after the main incident  I was like  This is SO obvious  There is no mystery at all   But I continued to read on since the writing was wonderful and I wanted to be able to say  I so saw this coming  in a smug way  But later I get on and find that I am thinking   Maybe  it could be this person too      and then I came to the end  And it turned out that I was wrong after all  I imagined every person to the culprit   except the culprit  Hawkins  writing was epic  She would give you clues about the totally wrong thing and you would believe it  Believe me  you should check this out if you want a breathless  fast paced  dangerous ride PS  Please check out Emily May s review for making up your mind  It was the one that convinced me to read it  Its much more better written than mine and sums up my feelings  and hers  of course  perfectly  The Girl on the Train is the debut    novel by Paula Hawkins  It is a fun  mostly exciting  and very fast read  It is not  however  and should not be compared to  Gone Girl   They are two completely different styles and moods and  at this stage  levels of intricacies in writing  The strange thing about this book is that although the main character is sad and drunk and a wholly unreliable narrator  the book has an almost breezy quality to it  as if you are on the train yourself whisking right along To give a  very  quick summary  the book is about Rachel  a lonely divorced drunk of a woman who has lost her job but still rides the commuter train as if to work each day  Each day she passes her old house where her husband and mistress  now new wife  live with their new baby and has difficulty coping  3 houses down from where she used to live she occasionally sees another couple    she names them Jess and Jason    and through brief glimpses from the train as it rushes by makes up a love story for their lives  Then one day she sees the wife  Jess  appearing to kiss another man  Soon after  Jess disappears and Rachel insinuates herself into the investigation  But  she is an unreliable witness for she was drunk at the time and apparently had gotten off the train and been in the neighborhood at the time of the disappearance  Only problem is  Rachel has blackouts and cannot remember any details of the evening    The chapters are from the point of view of three different women   1  Rachel   2  her ex husband s new wife  Anna  and  3  the woman who disappeared  Through it all the  train rockets past the houses and Rachel struggles mightily with the idea of sobriety and the life she has lost  I don t want to give much away about the personalities of the other women and their struggles  but it adds some interest and another layer to the book Somewhere around page 150 200 I figured out the twist  but I was still having a great time  It did bog down about two thirds of the way through  but it picked back up and had an above average  but not great  ending  There was  I believe  a bit of trying to do too much intertwining of all characters introduced    you know    the kitchen sink approach  but it was still a strong debut I really am a solid 3 5 stars on this book but since that rating is not allowed I bumped it to 4 for the inventive premise  the quick pace  the character of Rachel and the changing narrations  Some tighter editing and not trying to be too much with what she had could have made it great  Still  she is an author to watch   lktb ytHdth blsn thlth shkhSyt nsy y    rytshl  myGn w na  lm stT  n t Tf w Hb   mn hdhh lshkhSyt lmHTm  l nn  lm stT  n

Tive que ficar acordada ontem ate acabar o livro para saber o que afinal tinha acontecido a Megan  A historia vai se desenrolando ate de forma bastante rapida e a partir de uma certa altura    eu so queria chegar ao fim  LOL Ja nao lia um livro assim viciante ha muito tempo Dou lhe 4 estrelas porque o recomendaria a alguem que goste de policiais  nao o deixaria na prateleira a apanhar po  As personagens sao todas intragaveis  nao simpatizei com nenhuma  mas nao vazias  Ler a historia do ponto de vista de uma mulher alcoolica que nao consegue parar de beber e frustrante  apetece bater lhe  Mas e uma boa perspectiva  diferente pelo menos  ajudou me a ter  mais  consciencia sobre os vicios    This is one of those reviews where I admit that pretty much all four of the stars I gave are for the writing and construction of the book  There are books like _Blood Song_ and _Pepper In The Gumbo_ and _Name Of The Wind_ and Harry Potter where you just plain like at least one of the characters  You root for them and are propelled through the story out of affection and hope  Then there are books like this  Everybody in this story is a deeply broken person  The more you read the more festering rot you find  I don t think there are going to be lots of little Rachels in kindergartens five years from now  because unlike Bella or Harry  Rachel is not a protagonist you treasure  But Hawkins gets full points for doing the unreliable narrator WELL  Unlike other books  _Gone Girl_  Im looking at you  this unreliable narrator is earnest and direct  For me the difference is between _withheld details_ and _deliberately wrong details_  You can have a book where you simply say  I m a middle aged woman reading  and then the surprise in store for the reader comes with the building reveal that the initial assumptions were incorrect  The reader will assume things based on that information and you can wallop them later with  I died when I was 42 and im reading my tombstone  or whatever  That s a well done unreliable narration  That s how this book is  The other type  where the author outright lies  is the type I dislike so much  That s unfortunately the type which is so popular now  In those the author says  I m a middle aged woman reading  and then halfway through says  ha  Just kidding  I m an illiterate man   That is NOT how this book is  The mere fact that Hawkins plays clever but not cheap with her audience elevates this book well above others it s compared to   Ok  not gonna lie  it took me a while to get into this book  I think it was because of the writing style and getting used to the pace of the story  The Girl on the Train is my first thriller  so I don t have anything else to compare it to  but I will say I had a good reading experience and here s why 1  The characters  especially Rachel  were so flawed and human that you can t help but want to find out what happens to them in the story  I got annoyed by some of them multiple times because despite good intentions  they always end up making poor decisions that make things worse  Did I have many pull my hair why do I read this moments  Yes  Was it worth it  Yes  It was worth it because it was so realistic that despite my frustrations with the characters  I question whether I would have fared much better  And that was scary 2  The Girl on the Train is so intriguing because it messes with your mind  You can t trust the characters and this was something new to me  It s not that they blatantly lie  it s that their perception of the truth is questionable and their perceptions of each other is also distorted  Overall  I strongly recommend this book to anyone looking for a psychological thriller with unreliable characters who will keep you guessing  I have heard this book be compare to  Gone Girl  over and over and that is part of what got me to pick up this novel  as I really enjoyed  Gone Girl    From the onset I was awaiting this mind blowing plot twist  with each turn of the page I was trying to think outside of the box for what is to come and I think I sort of ruined this novel for myself    as the mega twist never came  The plot was definitely interesting  and the ending was gripping and worth the read    but don t pick it up wanting it to thoroughly mess with your mind like  gone girl  did    because it doesn t This book is about fighting your inner demons  about finding your place in the world  your purpose  It is about the juxtaposition of the outside looking in  and what really happens on the inside  It is about making choices and living with their consequences  It is about love  jealousy and infidelity  It is about heartache and redemption  The idea of routine and riding the train daily is a really neat one  In the end  I really enjoyed this novel  Captivating story  flows well  It s flawed though   I couldn t understand why it was bought up at the end that Tom s fingernails had been ripped off from buying Megan s body  and yet no one noticed that earlier on in the book  Whether they were suspicious or not  it was a detail I would have liked to see earlier on  Tom gave no indications of being Megan s killer  and suspicions weren t led to him at all earlier on  That led me to the  really   response when I realized it was him   not because the author hid it SO WELL  but because there were no leads to anyone reading the story tying it to him  An improvement on the story would be to include some of those details throughout the book  but still lead the reader away from being suspicious of Tom  Otherwise  I liked the perspectives of the 3 main female characters   I thought Megan s role in particular was very well written  and representative of how someone in her mental state and suffering through the pain of loss would have acted 4 5  Wow  okay Paula Hawkins  debut thriller is not to be trifled with  The writing is sharp  the characters are deep  and the plot is mostly solid  Overall  the comparisons to Gone Girl are pretty spot on  and that s some high praise  seeing as Gone Girl ended up being one of the biggest books and movies of 2014 We begin the story with a girl named Rachel  the same girl for which the book is named  She s a depressed alcoholic that spends her days in solitude  taking trains back and forth from London to her little suburbs on the edge of the city  Every day the train stops just outside a home with a young couple living inside  and for a minute or so  Rachel is able to live vicariously through this couple  imagining the life she s always wanted  She names them  Jess  and  Jason   and the story revolves around the way this couple becomes a part of Rachel s life The one thing I will say is that this book is fast  I finished it in around eight hours  where Gone Girl took me a full day and a half   If you  like me  thought that Gone Girl was a little too slow  especially in the first third   then The Girl on the Train will probably be a better fit for you One major problem I had with the book  and the reason why it s only getting four stars and not five  was the viewpoint switching  The novel constantly switches between the three female leads  and often changes viewpoints at the most exciting parts  especially near the end  I found Anna s chapters to be mostly boring and pointless until the final fourth of the book  and I could have done without her saying the same things over and over for pages on end Another problem came from the fact that the book seemed to devolve into melodrama at times  with a lot of twists and turns for seemingly no reason whatsoever  I m glad that the ending tied everything up  but along the way I felt like areas of the plot became extremely tangential Overall  however  I thought that it was a solid debut  and it kept my attention and adrenaline going  4 5 stars  Well done  Figured out the killer early but did not foresee what I would call the final twist at the end  Read in about two days   so you know it was good  Story is told by multiple narrators  so I was occasionally checking the dates to see if things fit  By the way in this book no one is what they seem or what they appear  Rachel is the titular girl on the train  She s a mess  She s an alcoholic  Anna s married to Rachel s ex husband and Megan is their neighbor  It s a very small world  There s a lot going on under these ladies  surfaces My only qualm is that I am not sure someone should get so involved in other people s lives as Rachel does  I mean that did not seem realistic at all to me  But you know I still liked this book and would read more by this author  I just read another reviewer s comment that this book was much faster paced than Gone Girl in the beginning  but I really can t agree with that  The first third or so of this book  I thought  was a total slog  I felt bogged down  myself  in the misery of Rachel s alcoholism  I felt frustrated with her for not getting it together  for being so unreliable and dishonest  with others  with herself   Once I got through that much  though  it really started to flow for me  and I enjoyed the way the story unfolded very much  Now that I ve finished it  I m left with some uncomfortable feelings  as it wasn t exactly black and white  who was good and who was bad    but this is probably a good stretch for me  mentally  Comparisons to Gone Girl are inevitable  but I thought this book was quite different from that one  aside from the obvious superficial parallels  I m glad to have read each of them   El libro esta escrito en forma de diario con fechas y horas ademas de que los inicios de capitulos nos dicen quien lo esta contando  Asi pues tenemos 3 puntos de vista en el libro  el de Rachel  que sera el mayoritario  el de Megan y el de Anna Todo comienza con Rachel cogiendo el tren a la misma hora

protagonista que siempre viaja en el tren empezara a imaginar una vida para los residentes de la casa numero 15  les pondra nombres  Jess y Jason  pero lo que ella no sabe  es que su vida no es tal y como la imagina   See more at  http   lectorade1994 blogspot com es     Spoiler alert  EVERYONE is insane  Possibly even the baby   Definitely a good mystery thriller book  half way through and I was addicted  I had that constant feeling to find out what really happened  Kept you guessing until the end great read  No os voy a mentir  el misterio dejo de ser tal practicamente desde el principio  Culpable y motivo predecibles  al menos para mi  Pero tampoco puedo negar que me ha enganchado  lo lei en un dia  casi  y tengo muy claro por que  los personajes  Lo que no me gusta de las novelas de misterio es que siempre intentan conseguir personajes profundos  y tanto intentarlo  fallan  Sin embargo  en La chica del tren los personajes son reales  y no solo eso  sino que llegas a entenderlos  que no ha justificarlos    A really good read  looking forward to the movie   I really enjoyed listening to this book  It was more like a bed story for me unravelling the mysteries that are spinning inside Rachel s head  Rachel is the girl who goes to London everyday  pretending from her flatmate Cathy that she goes to work by train everyday even though she has been fired for a long time  She looks through the train s window at two married couples everyday whom appears to Rachel as being very happy and lucky even though it is quite the reverse as the story goes on  The story is told through Rachel mainly  Megan  and Anna too  Rachel starts to drink when they are told with Tom that she won t be able to conceive a baby therefore she drinks until she finds out Tom is with another woman  This woman is Anna who will have a child from Tom and marries him  Rachel is dissatisfied with her life and she is always drunk suffering from her dizziness and hangover The interesting thing about this novel is that the Author shows the psychological reactions inside Rachel s head and how she feels about the routines in her life  It is like a series of confessions about human nature P S  anyone who didn t enjoy reading this psychological novel and found it boring try the audio book version of this novel  With the level of alcoholism  cheating  lying  manipulation  and abuse that happens in the plot of The Girl on the Train  I found it hard to read  The characters make bad choices and then continue to make bad choices which affect the lives of everyone around them  There isn t a character whom I admire or would like to know in real life  But I would recommend the book for its quality of writing and pacing and suspense  The great Hitchcock classic  Rear Window  featured a witness who pieced clues together in full view of the murderer  He was incapacitated with a broken leg  The Girl on the Train features a witness who pieces memories together despite a debilitating addiction and derailing biases  She is incapacitated by her alcoholism and frequent blackouts  So many people drew similarities between this book and the classic film that I was ready for a pulse quickening thriller The Girl on the Train entwines the poor decisions of a young woman and the people around her into a messy  painful plot  What really happened  Did she imagine everything  Was she responsible for anything  And how will digging for the truth ruin her relationships with her ex husband  her roommate  her mother  and her counselor  I hope that the characters in Paula Hawkins s next novel are not as dysfunctional  Because I look forward to reading it     I wonder if Paula Hawkins had a cameo in her book      This book doesn t seem to really need any extra press  as it is the  hot  book right now  It is getting compared often to Gone Girl  and that is a reasonable comparison  Both feature highly unreliable female narrators  missing women  and questionable men  However  I enjoyed this book more The story is told through the perspectives of three women  although Rachel is the main narrator  Rachel  the girl on the train  takes the rail into London to work daily  or does she   and the route happens to take her past the home she previously shared with her husband  A husband who is now living in this same house with his new wife and child  The train is also often delayed beside another house in this same neighborhood  and Rachel has made a game of watching the occupants of this home and creating a story about their lives Another narrator is Anna  the new wife of Rachel s ex husband  We don t hear as much from her  but her perspective offers an interesting insight in to  the other woman   Lastly  we hear from Megan  the wife in the house Rachel watches from the train  The wife who goes missing  And Rachel feels she might know something about the disappearance  but she is blocked by one of her frequent alcoholic blackouts Rachel s story can be painful to read at times  but she is stronger than she thinks  I found her to be a nice change from Amy in Gone Girl  who was hard to root for  Although you aren t really sure where Rachel is coming from  you can see her growth and resolve as the novel progresses I don t really want to say any more  so as to not give any more away than I already have  I literally had trouble putting this book down  even reading as I brushed my teeth in the morning  The ending is thrilling and satisfying  which is always a concern with this type of book  Not all authors are able to pull it together  but Paula Hawkins does an excellent job  I look forward to her next book   F Hawkins  So at first I thought ya another story about a desperate women    then it took a twist I never imagined    though it has a very very slow start I still think it s amazing I love this book for the fact that it keeps you on edge the entire time  You don t know what s going on until the last couple of pages of the book  I love how the author used Rachel s drinking problem and her blackouts as a way to keep us so eager to know what Rachel couldn t remember  I don t think it s a creepier version of Gone Girl  but it s definitely creepy  So  in the genre of  thrillers with multiple narrators and the word  girl  in the title   I d say this sits squarely between Gone Girl and The Good Girl  It was less predictable than the latter  and not quite as well crafted as the former  I did enjoy listening to it  I think books with multiple narrators are always served well in audio  because the different voices can make up for any shortcomings the author has with actually writing different perspectives The idea behind the book is great  a woman thinks she witnessed a crime  but is an alcoholic and was blacked out  so she isn t sure what happened  So she  and the reader  have to piece that together For fans of books like this  I m sure this would be really enjoyable  and I did enjoy it  but I might be reaching my saturation point in this particular niche  I had a hard time getting into this book and put it aside for a few days before trying again  Once I got a few chapters in  I was hooked The story is told from the perspective of 3 characters  Rachel is the Girl on the Train  She is an alcoholic who is divorced and living with a girl from school  She often experiences blackouts  She travels to London every day for work and passes by her old house  She watches her house  where her ex husband has remarried and has a child  as well as the house down the road  She imagines the couple who she names  in a happy life Emma  the second narrator is the new wife  She does not like that Rachel calls the house and walks by  She wants Tom to call the police and have a restraining order against Rachel  She is worried for their child Megan  the third narrator  This is the woman who Rachel watches from the train  Her life is not as idyllic as Rachel imagines it to be  When Megan goes missing  Rachel insinuates herself into the life of Scott  Megan s husband and the investigation of Megan s disappearance A great suspenseful story of a disappearance and murder  Often compared to Gone Girl  but I think this was a much better book that I really enjoyed   The Girl on the Train  is an interesting mix of characters a reader really can t love  and a story that deserves attention  It brings up the consequences of relationships that have soured  self destructive tendencies  and many other broad concepts that deeply affect the characters in the book and the interactions that take place between them While hard to believe  the entanglements between the characters feel natural  and to a degree you almost feel exposed to a level of mental instability that really brings into question whether or not the main character of the novel is telling you the truth  and if she would even know if she were lying to you  Purely from this perspective alone  it is an interesting read once the main plot gets moving  give it a few chapters    it s a slow starter  I would recommend this book to others  but I dislike the comparison to Gone Girl that has permeated the novel s rise to the NYT Bestseller list  There are stark contrasts that will leave readers feeling as though this novel is overrated  and to some degree I can see where that comes from   The Girl on the Train  is a tough read because the characters are  almost unequivocally  portrayed as weak  While some of this works to further the plot  this almost becomes a defining characteristic  a dimension all to itself for each character  We deeply explore each one s personal failings  as if Hawkins is going out of her way to let us know that no character is perfect    no hero without stain  The result is an interesting story with characters who you feel just need a good bop on the back of the head to straighten up  and the weakness becomes a frustration for the reader as much as the other players in the novel  Having finished the book  I can t think of a single character I hope to see succeed in the future    nor do I really expect any of them to  and that s a hard conclusion to come to after such a thrilling plot Overall this is a good novel  a naked look at a number of concerning vices in life  and a thrilling ride  I had the hardest time deciding whether to give this 3 or 4 stars  I thought Hawkins did an excellent job with the characters  and with making dramatic events still seem like they could all plausibly happen to the same group of people  or that a person would make a certain choice because of an earlier event or choice  I ve seen some reviews say all of the characters are bad people but I don t feel that way  They are definitely imperfect as people but in realistic ways  with plenty of shading and varied internal lives  They may fail themselves or hurt people but  as with real people  not all of them purely out of selfishness  immorality  or amorality This book feels to me far less like an empty  trick  than Gone Girl did  Gone Girl was clever but pretty hollow  this book to me has a much realer feel  It kind of blew my mind  I knew it would be a great mystery because of all the hype but I didn t expect such interesting and developed characters to elevate the book above a mystery  The psychology of the characters was fascinating to me and by far the best part of the book  The resolution of the mystery was actually a bit of a letdown for me  not because I found it obvious as some of the reviewers did  but because it didn t explain anything about why the killer was how he she was or even how he she thought and perceived things  This is odd in this story and cheapens it  Like the mystery that inexplicably and unrealistically ties up too neatly  we suddenly have an unexplained psychopath which is just easy and sloppy of the author  The story is told from multiple points of view so why not a chapter or two in the mind of the killer towards the end  That would be awesome  I have additional reasons for not liking the resolution but discussing them would include spoilers  Nevertheless  I will probably find myself reading it a second time and I highly recommend it  3 5  It s hard for me to decide how to categorize this book  Is it a thriller  Yes  definitely  There are moments of tension and terror  Is it a mystery  Yes again  First person POV from three main characters gives the reader a tunnel vision look at the events surrounding the crime  We know all will be revealed in time  we just have to wait for Rachel or Anna or Megan to get us there  While they dole out little bits of memory we get to speculate on our various suspects  Is it a police procedural  Not even close  If I have a beef about this book it is the inept and underwhelming efforts made by the detectives investigating the murder I am glad I listened to the audiobook  The readers were excellent  The time shifting between Rachel and Megan was a bit confusing at first but I figured out what was going on after a bit of replaying  This is one of those books where clues are scattered here and there randomly  The mystery readers among you will narrow down your suspects quickly enough  I now understand what all the hype was about this book  The only comparison that I can see to Gone Girl is that this will definitely be coming to a theatre near you in the next few years     I once read a book by a former alcoholic where she described giving oral sex to two different men  men she d just met in a restaurant on a busy London high street  I read it and thought  I m not that bad  This is where the bar is set        Rachel  yes Karen  this is the most demonstrative quote for this book  This book deserves its own category  women s horror  Stephen King s Jack and Danny Torrence from The Shining   Doctor Sleep showed the violence and shocking depths alcoholics find themselves in  Alcoholism in a woman  written by a woman  is worse  Rachel is worse  I cringed through this whole book and not just at Rachel s actions  Megan and Anna are no pearls  This book could have been Train Wreck  Women Making Poor Choices   I couldn t stop listening  I finished it in a day  Maybe it s because it reminded me of some of my own poor choices  but this had me burying my face in my hands and groaning in shame  As Rachel says   the sense of shame I feel about an incident is proportionate not just to the gravity of the situation  but also to the number of people who witnessed it    Listening to this book was like seeing the worst moment of my life in a viral video  HORROR    Very much reminded me of Gone Girl  A very good read  I will preface with this  I listened to this one on audio book  So occasionally it was hard to keep up with the plot because it jumped characters so much  Overall  I felt like it had the same feeling of Gone Girl and that is not an original thought  it has been said before  but it was a thrilling mystery  I loved seeing the character development and where the story lead  I was happy with the ending in this book and would recommend it to those seeking a scary  ish  book  It did have foul language which drove me nuts  But overall pretty good  Kept me up late at night  woke me up early in the morning and made me late to work   3 53 narradores nada confiables Un final que no me convence 100 Recursos que se notaban un poquitin forzados que haya un accidente y que la protagonista siempre tenga acceso a nueva informacion porque se la entregaban en bandeja  le prestaban un tablet para leer el diario o se encontraba una edicion abandonada en el tren se que no es muy relevante pero me molesto Un monton de personajes detestables pero con una historia que te engancha No sera brillante y la prosa no es una gran maravilla pero me gusto    I still think it would be wonderful to have a man love you so much he d kill for you    Strangers on a Train  Setting Ashbury and London  England  2012 2013Coverly Love  No  I love the typography on the cover  It reminds someone of how the letters would look if a train were actually moving  But it s kind of boring  to be honest  Plot   One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl  four for a boy  five for silver  six for gold  seven for a secret never to be told   Do you ever wonder  when you re traveling on your daily commute to work  walking around your school campus  or just sitting at some nondescript park or shopping mall  what other people s lives are like  Are they happy with where they re heading  are they married  have children  This is what Rachel Watson does every day on her daily commute to London on the train  She likes to observe one couple in particular  She calls them Jess and Jason  and to her  they seem to have a perfect life  Better than hers is at the moment  An overweight  depressed  alcoholic recovering from a bitter divorce and her ex husband marrying the woman he cheated on her with  Jess and Jason are her escape  the only uplifting part of a normally dismal day  That is  until Rachel sees something  And then Jess goes missing  She knows she has to report it to the police  but who would ever believe a serial drunk  How reliable would they think she really is  And becoming entangled in the mystery of her golden couple will land her smack dab into the affairs of her ex husband and his new wife  much to their dismay  In this twisted game of cat and mouse  who can be trusted I should probably give due warning here  Please don t compare this to Gone Girl  I don t know why everybody and his brothers wants to compare the next big psychological thriller to it  but it s getting old real fast  Let this book stand on its own  and when you do  it becomes utterly compelling  The Girl on the Trainis one of those books that you simply cannot put down  You have to find out what s next  or you get this restless feeling in your mind  It s what I like to call a  popcorn thriller   it doesn t make you think  but it s highly enjoyable to say the least  All of the characters may be completely unlikable and the plot may seem like the same old  same old  but it s just as thrilling and suspenseful  You don t know who to trust  like or believe Characters   I am not the girl I used to be  I am no longer desirable  I m off putting in some way  It s not just that I ve put on weight  or that my face is puffy from the drinking and the lack of sleep  it s as if people can see the damage written all over me  can see it in my face  the way I hold myself  the way I move    Rachel  to put it lightly  is not in the best place in her life  A severely depressed alcoholic who s recently divorced  humiliated by the fact that she s been cast aside for a prettier  more  put together  woman  the only bright spots of her day are when she s holding her bottle of whatever alcohol she s in the mood for and her train rides  This allows her to shut her off  A lot of you probably won t like Rachel because of here severe unreliability and careless  needy nature  but in an odd way  she seems real  She s not over the top nutters  and the more you read about her  the more you understand what lead her to this point    He won t say no to me  I was thinking about it on the way home  and that s the thing I like most about it  having power over someone  That s the intoxicating thing     Jess s name really isn t Jess  Jess is really Megan Hipwell  married to Scott Hipwell  former owner of a failed art gallery who doesn t seem to know what she wants to do with her life  Whose unhappiness in her marriage leads her to having a sordid affair  Who also happens to hide a deep  dark secret she covers up with layers and layers of lies  The girl that goes missing  and no one seems to know where she is  And when they do  and her secrets start to come out of the closet  those closest to her start to wonder if they ever knew her at all    Being the other woman is a huge turn on  there s no point denying it  you re the one he can t help but betray his wife for  even though he loves her  That s just how irresistible you are    Anna is the woman who essentially replaced Rachel  The  other woman   And she liked it  There are no warm feelings between Rachel and Anna  and Anna doesn t feel the least bit sorry about the part she played to Rachel s path to self destruction  She has her picture perfect life with her handsome husband and beautiful daughter  But as the old saying goes  looks can be deceiving  Soon the cracks begin to show  and picture perfect Anna isn t sure how to deal with it all  Anna was probably the only narrator you mostly liked  at least that was in my case  Pros The unique thing about this book is that all the characters are ones who you alternately want to slap across the face on one page and then immediately feel sorry for on the next  It takes a good writer to make you feel both sympathy and hatred for their characters  often at the same time or within a span of a few words  Paula Hawkins also has a wonderful writing style that makes her book easy to read  Cons If you haven t already heard  this book has been essentially called the next Gone Girl  If you walk into this book completely expecting it to be just that  you ll probably be disappointed  And if someone were to directly ask me which of the two I liked better  I would have to say Gone Girl  because Gillian Flynn is just so bloody brilliant in her writing and ability to create effed up characters  While this book was sensational  it wasn t quite as sensational as its predecessor  Love Triangle  Well  Tom is a philandering SOB  so there s plenty of love triangles going on here  We already know he cheated on Rachel with Anna  and Megan was having an affair of her own  But there s plenty more where this came from  and you ll have to read it to find out  Instalove  Nope A Little Romance  Let s just get this out of the way folks  true love doesn t exist in this book  In fact  I highly doubt love exists in this book at all  I say this because there are literally zero romantic connections between any of the main characters and their main squeezes  There may have been at one time  but when we are introduced to them  it s long gone  Rachel s love life is basically hopeless  Megan s not happy with Scott  and while Anna and Tom are seemingly the only happily blissful couple in the book  rest assured something fishy is going on  Especially with Tom being such a cad  Conclusion For some  they may see the ending from a mile away  It may seem a bit ridiculous  but it s actually brilliant in a twisted way  Not Gone Girl brilliant  here I go again   but enough to surprise the reader enough to it to not be totally unexpected  A fast paced thrilling read that you won t be able to put down  And the next time you head to work or go to school  you may be looking and wondering at strangers more than before  Keep an Eye Out for This  The film rights to this book have already been optioned by DreamWorks  so look out for this to  potentially  come to a theater near you   This one started a bit slow for me  but once it got going I was very drawn in  Everyone seemed a bit crazy  so there was plenty to keep me guessing   I would almost say I loved this book  I liked it better than Gone Girl  even if it was an infinitesimal amount  This book has the twisty characters you love to hate and still root for anyway  without some of the excessive  ick  factor I felt in Gone Girl  It perhaps a tad less dark and seemed more based in reality   something I could legitimately see happening in real life If you re looking for a good  dark mystery  especially an audiobook version for commuting   this is your piece  For full effect  I recommend reading this thriller on a commuter train   None of the characters are likable  But the book still is     go figure  Definitely 4 stars  may be 4 5  Although it was a difficult book to read   three different voices telling the story  three diffrerent women and with two different time frames Maybe my brain is not what it used to be  but I found it tough  and I often went backwards to check the time stamp on the chapters But then I reached the half of the book  and the pace started to increase   the chapters were shorter  the two time frames were getting closer to each other  and I could not put the book down any longer  well the Kindle actually  This book really is good stuff  Inicio muito monotono  depois empolgante  gostei  ainda bem que dei mais uma oportunidade  The Girl on the Train was a very good read  I finished the book within three days  I would describe the book as a thriller  Throughout most of my read  I was asking questions  trying to piece things together  and turning immediately to the next page to find answers  I did not want to put this book down and would have finished it in one day had I not been a college student who needed to study  I enjoyed how Hawkins wrote and provided a lot of dialogue throughout the story  I was able to clearly envision the whole story in my head as if it were a movie  which I hope it becomes   I found myself thinking about what was going to happen next in this book while at work and in class and could not wait to pick the book back up again  The book is told in first person point of view by three female characters  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  You get a glimpse of each narrators lives and as you read you try to piece together the mystery  Rachel is the main character of the story  Rachel is a depressed  alcoholic who divorced her husband because he had an affair  Rachel s divorce  and seeing her ex husband with Anna  the other woman  and their child all enable Rachel s drinking  One thing that is constant in Rachel s daily life is riding the train twice a day  Rachel rides on the train and observes life going on from behind the window of the train  The train passes by Rachel s old neighborhood and this leads to stories from Rachel s past  Every day Rachel also sees a couple outside together  Rachel takes notice of the couple s gestures  appearances  and home environment  Rachel creates this picture perfect romance between this couple in her mind  When an investigation arises involving Megan  the girl from the couple that Rachel observes   Rachel feels she could be helpful because of her observations and her nearby locations on certain days  Will Rachel s input help the investigation  Will Rachel s input hurt the investigation  You ll have to read the story to find out yourself  The book is very intriguing and a great read  One thing that did disappoint me though was the ending  The entire lead up to the ending was great and I suppose I imagined something more intriguing and less cliche for an ending  Towards the end of the story I found myself losing some interest because the story became quite repetitive and cliche  Overall  this book is a good read  I enjoyed analyzing what was going to happen and getting a glimpse of different characters live s and stories and intertwining them together in my own way to figure out the story Recommend this story for a quick  enjoyable read   make everyone look like a victim  And boom  you re clueless  An unimaginable mystery plot and a great page turner   Great psychological thriller that will keep you guessing until the very end  We all observe other people when we are out traveling commuting but how many of us actually believe we know what s going on with strangers and their lives  That s exactly what happens with The Girl on the Train  Rachel  a divorced drunk who has lost her job still rides the train into London every day   observes a young couple out the train window  She creates a story about them   their happy life  even giving them the names Jess   Jason   One day  Rachel sees Jess with another man in a romantic embrace in her own yard   then discovers that Jess  really Megan  has gone missing  Rachel decides she must get involved because of what she s witnessed out the train window  Told from alternating voices  Rachel  the drunk   Megan  the cheater   missing girl    Anna  Rachel s ex husband s new wife   the story is fast paced with plenty of backstory   motive from several characters  So why not 5 stars  Well  I thought the therapist was a little weak he didn t add much to the story  And we never find out how Megan s past gets revealed to the press  I have a guess   maybe that s what the author intended   4 3 5  Very entertaining  The pages almost seem to turn themselves  Hawkins use of first person narrative to tell the story was creative and allowed her to develop the characters of the three women in this story  each deeply troubled and insecure in their own ways  The character of Rachel was especially well developed and I wished Hawkins could have gone deeper with the other two  I also found something lacking in the climax  The big action sequence just didn t seem right and Anna s reaction did not ring true  However  this is a perfect summer  beach  book  Quick read and fun  You want to find out what happens to these people  A good murder mystery  well written and certainly a book to get everyone talking  No me ha durado ni 24 horas  Aunque bastante predecible  en seguida imagine quien era el la asesino a   engancha  Hay que tener un poco de paciencia al principio  Me lo imagino con adaptacion cinematografica  Le doy 3 5 estrellas Uma obra onde o as pequenas coisas que preenchem os nossos dias e as grandes coisas que preenchem as nossas vidas se miscigenam   e pequenas fantasias dao lugar a novas realidades   com tonalidades vivas e contrastes escuros Este thriller leva nos na espiral descendente que e a vida de Rachel   espiral essa que se traduz numa montanha russa de emocoes e sentimentos no leitor  as imagens e ideias construidas ao longo da obra rapidamente sao transformadas e repensadas  as personagens que pensamos conhecer e compreender revelam se cada vez mais complexas  verdadeiras e intrigantes  os cenarios tao mundanos que iludem e confundem com o comum do dia a dia  realcando o realismo e sentimento de presenca ao longo da narrativa  Uma das particularidades desta obra e a sua capacidade para mostrar dois lados de cada acao  A autora nao foca apenas os eventos que rodeiam a protagonista e como estes a afetam  mas tambem como sao interpretados e vividos por todos envolvidos Uma obra de leitura facil  viciante e aconselhada a todos interessados no cativante do inesperado  I thought I was going to be confused throughout the book with all the back and forth but I wasn t  I couldn t put the book down  I kept changing my mind about the outcome  I really liked it  Good suspense Like Gone Girl but still really enjoyable  The three points of view gave me insight into each perspective and the end was good  So as far as the comparison to Gone Girl goes  I d say    not really  Yes  it is a thriller and  yes  all 3 female characters are whack jobs but none of them has anything on Amy Dunne  As far as the plot  I really liked how the mystery unfolds and how Rachel s life becomes linked with Anna and Megan  I started out really disliking Rachel but she grew on me as the story progressed  and she ended up being my favorite character by the end of the novel  I really got wrapped up in her black holes and mixed up memories and her struggle with alcohol  What is weird is that the closer I got to the denouement  the less engaged I became in the story  I feel like the ending was a bit too quickly paced so I lost the anxiety and build up because things unraveled too fast  Nevertheless  it was thoroughly enjoyable and mostly engrossing read  Audiobook4 5 solid starsNarration   Clare Corbett  Louise Brealey  India Fisher   Really GoodThere are three female MC s and for each of their POV s  there is a different narrator  They all have British accents  and I can listen to a British  Aussie  or Scottish narrators ALL DAY LONG  But the story  Oh My Gosh  Is it a romance  Hmmm   Could beIs it a mystery  Uhhh   DefinitelyIs it suspenseful  Mmmm   Maybe a little Is it strange  Uhmm   yip Actually  I didn t really know ANYTHING about this book and I think that was the best way to go about it  Had no idea what to expect  What a strange  twisty plot this little number had to it  So  to make this a good read for you  I m saying nothing about it  except I loved it   Book titles are more important than people realize  Their mission is to evoke intrigue  attract the reader  and make them wonder what the story is about all within a word or a sentence  The Girl on the Train is a great example of that  when I first scanned the title  I thought   Who is this girl  What happens on the train   So my imagination began to shape different scenarios of what could be held within these pages   and I should have stopped there  because this novel that held such great hope turned out to be just another  wannabe  thriller  The story of The Girl on the Train is simple enough  English commuter and alcoholic Rachel Watson s life has gone to shambles  and she has done nothing to make it better  Her husband divorced her because of her alcoholism  the causes behind it don t make it more justifiable but a bit more understandable   his mistress moved into their home after she was kicked out  and now she spends her free time pretending to go to work by riding the train to and from London  As she looks out the window  she makes careful observations of the scenery and takes a special interest in the new neighbors a couple of doors down from her old house  giving them fake names   Jason and Jess  and an imaginary life that placates her own fantasies One morning on the train  Rachel noticed Megan  aka Jess  outside with another man  which becomes the catalyst to a string of terrible events   Hence the name  The Girl on the Train     Soon there s a disappearance  and Rachel gets in over her head by not understanding the difference between being helpful and being a pest  especially in an investigation where she may be a suspect What saved this novel was the writing and the pace  Hawkins knew how to get you sucked into the story   which may come from her 15 years  experience as a journalist  and relate to the characters on some pretty deep levels  She s so good with conjuring emotion that I found myself steaming with frustration toward Rachel s character  If the story was centered on her  why not make her a strong heroine  Why make her a pathetic alcoholic who  granted was a good person  lets her poor judgement affect her decisions  If she was to have started off this way and then grow into a stronger  more confident person  then I would feel differently  but there was no growth in Rachel  Yes  she was able to take down her own demons by the end but I don t give her credit for doing so  She didn t go searching for them to become a better person  she took them down because they were right there in her face and had no choice It may not sound like it but The Girl on the Train was honestly a good  solid novel  As I said  there are great characters  despite Rachel s shortcomings  that are extremely real and complex  a great pace that will keep you reading to the end  and a decent twist that will leave you momentarily satisfied  Unfortunately  compared to other thrillers I ve read  this did not stand up to them and made me wonder if this novel should have been about a different girl on a different train  If you ve heard the hype for this book you might have heard it compared to Gone Girl and I have to say that I agree 100   I thought it was a complete page turner  a psychological thriller that kept me guessing till the very end  Fun beach book  I really enjoyed it and thought it was hard to put down   La Chica del Tren es un thriller diferente  tanto por su ambientacion  como por sus personajes  Nada policiaca  me ha recordado mucho a Perdida  sin llegar a ser tan buena  of course Su personaje principal es patetico y eso es una novedad  La trama avanza bien y se hace corto el libro  aunque si es cierto que el principio es totalmente atipico y sorprende  El giro final es un pelin forzado pero aun asi es bueno  Puede que me la hay matado un poco el hype  pero es una buena novela negra Veremos si su adaptacion cinematografica es tan buena Well that was interesting  The Girl on the Train is a twisted story of relationships  secrets  betrayals and murder  This book is the very definition of unreliable narrator  everyone in the book has a hidden agenda and massages the truth to produce the results they want  I m not going to give a plot synopsis in this review because I feel this book is better enjoyed the fewer details you know beforehand  I highly recommend this book  so grab a copy  strap on your seatbelt and enjoy the  wild  ride   I was so impressed with the style of this book  that after I read it  I suggested it as our next book for our book club     it is coming up this Thursday  so I m not quite sure how they liked it  but I found it most enjoyable  And to know that it has been number 1 since coming out on the best sellers  list makes it even better because I read a book lots of people like and are talking about  I enjoy mysteries  and this was a lot like  Gone Girl  in how unorthodox the style of writing was     once again  there are very few people to like in the book  like Gone Girl   and the narration goes back and forth from one unreliable narrator to the next  while the reader tries to sift through the data to get to the truth and hopefully guess who the killer is before it is totally revealed to us  I esp  liked the opening in its Hitchcockian way of revealing the characters to us     some books are so pedantic about the exposition  but this took right off  The middle part is where it gets a tad confusing  and right before it goes into high gear  there were a few passages that seemed to get annoying and tedious      in fact  I started to question whether this book was showing women in a bad light or not  but then when it got to the ending  I was sure I was glad I read it  If you do pick this up  I suggest you have a time line next to you like I used for Time Traveler s Wife  because all the dates can be annoying because you really need to pay attention to them and details  But that s what I liked and I highly recommend this one  I d give it 4 5 stars  Characters were amazing but I wanted more at the end  Very minimal complaint as the entire book was a great read  I d say this book is the creepier version of Gone Girl with soooo many knots in it  It was really thrilling and exciting to read  If you re a crime suspense lover you d finish this book in a single sitting  I took months to complete this book because    college    Overall  no wonder people compared it to Gone Girl  The Girl on the Train got shades of Gone Girl  which could annoy you if you re really fanatic over Gone Girl  Gone girl impressed me with its sleek writing  The writing and mystery were so alligned and neat On the other hand  The Girl on the Train seemed scattered in writing  it wasn t as perfect as the Gone Girl style  at least to me   And  like Gone Girl  it had so many entwined secrets which were finally resolved in a most unpredictable way   The Girl on the Train  by Paula Hawkins is one that I have seen everywhere   in the bookshop  the supermarket  advertised online  I debated buying the book for a long time  but it was only when I got hold of the audiobook that I actually started listening to the story  The story takes on the perspectives of three women   Rachel  an alcoholic  Megan  a cheat  and Anna  the mistress  Soon their lives and stories become entwined as Rachel forces herself into a missing person s case  which soon turns into a murder mystery  None of the narrators were particularly reliable  which ended up leading the reader on an enjoyable wild goose chase as you try and work out the truth of what happened None of the main characters are particularly likable  and yet you end up liking them for that very reason  with the exception of Anna   Their lives are complete messes  each with their own issues and difficulties  I really enjoyed seeing how  through the different POVs  you could see how one s perspective of a person can be very different from who that person actually is   you never know the whole side of the story  The mystery was interesting  although the solution was fairly predictable and  if I m honest  the reasoning behind it seemed a bit off  However  what really kept me going was exploring the characters  joining them on their various journeys  I really admired Rachel s development  and I could really get on board with her as a person  despairing and applauding her  Megan was also a fascinating character  she clearly had deeply ingrained problems and seeing things from her perspective   the reasoning behind why she did certain things  was interesting  Anna was the only one of the three that I could not really get into   there was very little character development as you did not spend enough time with her in comparison to the other two characters  and I was not a huge fan of her voice actress  which pulled me out of the story a bit  That being said  it was a really good book  The dates were confusing  and it did get a bit repetitive and tedious in the middle  but otherwise I really enjoyed listening to it and it sounds like a book that is quite good on the page as well   Mucho mas entretenida de lo que me esperaba  Un poco previsible al final  pero su adictiva narrativa te acaba enganchando hasta la ultima pagina  In some ways  reminds me of The Good Girl   alternating first person POVs that time jump  But it s much better than that book  It s called a thriller  but it s a little too slow paced for that  I d call it a mystery  and a good one at that Rachel takes the train twice a day  every day  Every day  she looks out her window  and every day  she sees an attractive couple who she imagines to be perfect together  One day  however  her view of them is shattered when she sees the woman kiss another man  Not long after  the woman  who she learns is named Megan  goes missing  Rachel finds herself inserted in the situation both because she was seen in Megan s neighborhood that night  her ex husband  Tom  his new wife  Anna  and their young daughter  Evie  live nearby  and because she chooses to tell both the police and Megan s husband  Scott  about the man she saw Megan kissing  thinking this man might be a suspect  The police consider her unreliable  however  because she has a drinking problem  she admits that she does not clearly remember the events of the night Megan went missing  Further complicating things is the fact that she is having trouble letting her marriage to Tom go  Shifting between the first person perspectives of Rachel  Megan  and Anna  the book slowly reveals the events of that night  exploring the connections between the characters involved The narration of the book  as well as the way the events slowly unfold  is very intriguing  You are initially positioned to view Rachel s version of events with suspicion  as the police and some of the other characters do  only to slowly realize that though  yes  she does have a drinking problem  that doesn t make her wrong about everything   and there are characters with much  much worse problems than she has  characters who actively work to both exacerbate her drinking problem and make her question her own memory and sanity  view spoiler  The more we learn about Rachel s ex husband  Tom  the more he gives the reader chills  He does so many wrong things  and is so good at both justifying his actions and at getting the women in his life to blame themselves or each other rather than him  that he is likely to make readers sick to their stomachs  If you ve EVER been with a romantic partner who was an expert at getting you to question your own interpretation of reality  who was able to make you like them even as they did horrible things to you  who managed to make you angry at and suspicious of everyone in the situation BUT them  you will be deeply  deeply disturbed at how wrong things can go when a person like that is involved   hide spoiler  As a whole  the book was a very satisfying reading experience  with characters who perhaps seem a bit over the top at times  yet have just enough recognizable qualities and characteristics that you won t doubt that people like them could exist  This is a very well told mystery and thriller  This was a great vacation read  I agree with everyone who said it is similar to Gone Girl  I will say about halfway through the book I was able to figure out who the killer was but I still enjoyed the process of getting there  In the quest to find another  Gone Girl   I picked this book up  It was also nominated for one of the best books this year  and I can see why  As a thriller mystery  this book does a great job of keeping the author in a constant state of wondering and suspense  The book is narrated by 3 women  Rachel  Anna  and Megan  Rachel and Megan s voices sounded very similar to me  so it was hard sometimes to remember whose narration I was reading  Both are self pitying  younger women who are unsatisfied with their romantic lives The ending was somewhat unexpected  but with such a small cast  it was easy to point the finger at everyone  The climax was satisfying  and I especially appreciated the way that the women in this novel were able to pull themselves out and overtake the murderer without help from the authorities  Overall  this was a great and exciting read  but it s not necessarily a mind bending thriller filled with plot twists   Que decir de La chica del tren  Esta dentro de un genero que no es de mis favoritos  y para ser sincera solo la he leido por toda la publicidad que le han dado En si  la historia me ha parecido interesante por la variacion de las voces narrativas  quienes la cuentan son las tres protagonistas principales  Rachel  Megan y Anna   aunque Rachel es la que mas predomina  Los persomajes masculinos solo se ven retratados a traves de ellas La forma cronologica en que se van contando los hechos  al menos para mi  ha hecho solo que mis hipotesis sobre la responsabilidad del asunto solo variaran entre los personajes  por supuesto que llegados a cierto punto de la historia resulta mas que obvio  pero para ese momento yo ya queria saber el porque total asi que no me preocupaba  Ademas  la explosion de accion en las ultimas paginas resulta vivificadora para el final En definitiva ha sido una historia que me ha enganchado y entretenido  y reconozco que para los acostumbrados al genero no debe ser de lo mejor  Recomendable  Great  fast  suspenseful read  I spent much of this book intrigued by the concept of gin and tonic in cans  Everyone called this the  next Gone Girl  but I think that s too much  The book is a page turner  yes  but I say it s still a far cry from Gone Girl  For one  I already guessed  whodunit  halfway through the book  And after all has been said and done  it doesn t leave that  WTF  feeling Gone Girl is so known for That being said  I would still recommend this book if you re looking for a psychological thriller to read  It s gripping and gives it share of a mind f ck  4 stars  Great read  Don t read the last half of the book unless you have time to finish it because you won t be able to put it down  I can t believe I got really stuck on this book that long  Maybe because I got bored with the dates in this book I would appreciate the date flashes in movies and maybe because of it s slow pacing Or maybe because I ve been reading some other books that interested me more I know it sounds unfair but I m not done yet right After reading the books I was currently reading I ve been deciding what to read next and when I saw that this book s still on my currently reading status I read the synopsis so It may refresh me what the story is all about from where I stopped and marked this book  It s then that I realized that I should have finished reading this novel right the moment I ve started it This is a well written absolutely plotted psychological thriller that will make you think and suspect who the real killer is  It s not too far into the book that I ve already guessed the culprit And this is the reason why I never put this book down the moment I continued reading it I just didn t like the main character or the main narrator here whose name is also Rachel OMG She s so annoying LOL But then I liked her at the last part   This is highly recommended to psychological suspense thriller readers  3 5 s I read this book because my wife had just finished it and wanted someone to talk about it with  It gets a lot of comparisons to Gone Girl  which are probably apt  I never read Gone Girl but I did see the movie   as they both are thrillers that double as through provoking social commentary on infidelity  marriage  family etc  For my money  this is what a thriller should be  I felt myself compelled to keep on reading as I was completely caught up in all the twists and turns  but even when the pace or logic faltered it was forgivable because I felt like there was enough interesting exploration into the overall themes to keep me engaged  So if anyone tells you this book was boring because they  figured it out  halfway in  they are missing half the point  but if that s your whole thing  then yes  it s possible to figure it out at least 2 3 in  I m also a big sucker for books with multiple viewpoints because it s a lot easier to add a level of richness to a set of events when an author explores it from a few angles  Hawkins does a great job of fleshing out three characters who are unique enough that they stand on their own  but similar enough that they are fun to compare  My only criticism really  and it s a light one  is that sometimes descriptions of motivations for characters get a little repetitive and tough to stomach  It s probably necessary given the time frame of the narrative  but maybe Hawkins could have trusted the reader a little more to keep in mind that alcoholics will do alcoholic things  and not re explain the character s mindset before each episode  But I don t know  maybe I would have forgotten  Anyway  it was a good quick read and hot take  if you like thrillers  you ll like this one  Not a single likable character   just a really good read  This is a pretty amazing book  Each of the character seems terrible and that should make this book awful but it isn t  It just adds to the mystery as each events unfold Like anyone on this book is capable of such an act and believe me  I searched for motives and means  And still I am unsure of who did what  As being compared to Gone Girl and I saw why but I honestly think The Girl on the Train shone light on itself  It has its own dark twisted secrets to unfold Kudos to Ms Paula Hawkins  You know  this was good  I was expecting another Gone Girl  since this is being billed as such  but the comparison was only in popularity  With the comparison  this book seems above average  but without it I think the book would have been much better I did not see some of the twists coming  and overall it was a good read Give Hawkins a break  for a debut  it proves there s a great new talent in the field of thrillers  Wow  this book is a bit of a rush  It s almost impossible to put down  and I did get quite a way through before I starting making any correct assumptions about how it would end  There is not one single likeable character in this book  That s not to say the characters aren t interesting  just terribly flawed and unhappy  I don t want to give anything away  but the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the last couple of chapters made me picture Jennifer Lopez in the movie version  Anyway  worth the read  for sure  Not a happy book  no sympathetic characters  but an intriguing book  When Rachel takes the commuter train every day  she passes a house in her old neighborhood and builds a fantasy around a young couple living in that house  After the wife is murdered  Rachel even meets the husband  And she also continues to harass her former husband and his new wife  A murder mystery with twists and turns to the plot plus a look at the life of an alcoholic  Rachel  and how damaging addiction can be  Rightly so  some have compared Hawkins s new thriller The Girl on the Train to Flynn s Gone Girl  with respect to similarly flawed and unlikable characters  Here  the story is narrated by three women whose marriages are in varied stages of  dis assembly  who all have lived on the same street   their morbid connection becomes clear when one of them goes missing  An engaging  fast read with a quite realistic portrait of alcoholism and the psychotic demons it creates  this gripping  psychological mystery was a pleasing quicky right on schedule  I ve rated this highly as it was a real page turner  but it definitely did have its issues  Like Gone Girl  there s not one truly likeable character in the whole book  The women really are exceptionally weak  and anyone who reads my reviews  all two of you   would know by now that I get a bit annoyed reading about women who are all about babies  Well  this book has got three of them  Rachel became an alcoholic because she couldn t have a baby  Megan is wracked with guilt because she accidentally killed her baby  I also didn t like the attitude towards her based on that   she was exhausted and she made a mistake  There was a lot of  she got what she deserved   she was a monster  happening here  which struck me as rough    Anna was just   ugh    moved in on Rachel s husband and instantly supplied the child Rachel couldn t  Hello  could we have at least one character of the three who isn t motivated by that   The men are hardly any better  Cheating  lying  abusive  Wow  I thought I had a low opinion of people   this author tops me  The actual book is pretty good  Flows along at a good pace  Read it very quickly   couldn t put it down  I did guess the twist before the end  but I suspected a few others first  Overall it is a pretty good thriller  which could have been great with a bit more thought put into the characters  Finally  It took me three months but I managed to finish it  First book that I have finished since baby was born  I am hapoy it was this one  what a great read  It was compelling and wonderfully written  It was overflowing with suspense and was really good at making you feel kind of dirty and ashamed as you read from the perspective of each character  The ending was slightly lackluster but very fitting with a nice twist  Las primeras 200 paginas no me engancharon y fueron un 3 5  desde ahi hasta la 300 fue un 3 5 5 y a partir de ahi fue muuuuuuy bueno  asi que me decidi por darle 4 5Proximamente la resena en http   mimundoestaentuspaginas blogsp    Paula Hawkins  debut psychological thriller  The Girl on the Train  brings deserved comparison to Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl  Both have chapters that are written from different perspectives and both have complex and damaged characters in their dark centers The main protagonist is Rachel  a 20 something who is the titular character whose London train commute takes her past the back garden of  Jason and Jess  a young couple  At least that is the name she has concocted for them  She has crafted an imaginary picture of their lives  as though she knows them  But when she witnesses something  in a  Rear Window  kind of way  she convinces herself she must get involved to solve the mystery Hawkins uses two other female characters to narrate chapters  She also alternates the recent past  as seen from the eyes of Megan  with the current situation of Rachel and Anna  the wife ofRachel s ex husband As the story progresses  we see each of one of these characters has their own problems  although they may be in self denial The beauty and the thrill is in the confusion that each brings to the plot  Certainly  a theme Hawkins explores is how we can be so sure of what we see or have imagined  only to be so self deceived  And we then often flip to the opposite extreme  becoming as convinced of this  truth  as we were of the former The Girl on the Train suffers like Gone Girl from unlikable characters  But the conclusion is a little more satisfying Grade  A  I liked this book  the way it was written   the characters  I thought it was a very good debut novel  Very fast paced and really captured my interest  A classic  who dunnit   with crazy  pathological liars and alcoholics as characters  make for a believable psycho thriller  I ve read reviews that compared it to Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl  but  for me  there isn t much comparison   The Girl on the Train uses the same construct device as A Visit From the Goon Squad    story told from different character s point of view and in different time frames    but this book is as good as that one was bad  Paula Hawkins was able to use the device to develop the story and tension in a way it could not have been accomplished otherwise  creating a tight  suspenseful chiller  The book alternates among three women s stories  with Rachel  reeling from her divorce  as the primary narrator  Each morning during her commute from a suburb into London  her train slows on the same section of track behind a row of Victorian houses  Two houses there interest her  one is her former residence and the current home of her ex husband  Tom  and his new wife  Anna  the other is home to an attractive  couple who frequently appear on their back terrace  Anna and the attractive woman are the other two points of view telling the story which propels along  picking up speed as the story develops   My Sister in law recommended this book to me  I m a romance kind of girl and knowing this book was more mystery than romance  I wasn t chomping at the bit to get started on it  However  I trust her recommendations so start it I did  And I was immediately sucked in  I don t think there was a single likable character in the entire book  As for the main character  if there was a choice to be made she chose wrong   every time  The author captivated me with her method of story telling and held my attention through to the very last page  I struggled with the first few chapters of this book  It pained me to read about a drunk Rachel  Initially I thought Megan lacked depth  Nevertheless  this book ended up being a cant put down read  Wow  What an ending  Do not read the last chapter first  for those of you who do that   Great book     Strangely enough  this is a classic  who done it  disguised as a novel  It was a great  quick read  Not quite as evil as  Gone Girl   but that s a major plus in my opinion   I have to start off by saying that I walk away from this book feeling down right depressed  I knew it was a thriller but the characters lives were just so depressing once you got to know them  Perhaps I just live in a world of sunshine and lollipops     However  I think the book was well thought out and artfully written  But I did figure out who the guilty part was early on which I m rarely able to do  Perhaps it was just a lucky guess  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a creepy  think Sleeping with the Enemy  book   Overall I liked this book  It was a bit predictable at times but it was a good debut thriller from Paula Hawkins I loved this contemporary thriller so much more than some other current tales  We chose it for our Riverstone Book Club title for June  Once it got started and I oriented myself to the three POV characters  the story took off and I couldn t put it down I discovered tons of deep internal issues between these three characters  Rachel  Anna  and Megan  that kept me guessing to the reveal at the end  I will say this   the way Hawkins tied up their loose ends made for a very satisfying read  Lots of heartbreak  suspense  and deep internal reflection about love  trust  and human interaction Definitely a good read  I had such high expectations for this book after hearing the comparisons to Gone Girl  which is one of my favourite books and was what got me interested in the crime thriller genre  and I have to say that it wasn t what I expected  While there are many similarities to Flynn s novel  the detestable narrators  missing wife  marital issues  pregnancy etc   I feel that Hawkins did a great job of creating a unique world that was so real it was at times  confronting  While there were slow parts    I just couldn t put it down  I had to know what happened even though I was abhorred by the things that especially Rachel and Megan had done  The characterisation was what engaged me and I m interested to see what else Hawkins has to offer   A mi me gusto bastante el libro dentro de todo con sus intrigas  los conflictos psicologicos de los personajes y como los mismos hechos iban variando con cada capitulo   menos cuando Rachael se ponia en papel  tengo un plan  y terminaba haciendo todo lo contrario  At first  I was bored with the characters and considered them a bit one dimensional  Then  I realized that I was becoming immune to books that presented characters in a real light  I m talking like next store neighbor or Sally   Joe down the street  This story can leave an impression without including all of the flashiness or exaggeration  This story could have easily been an extension to anyone s own life because it explores a few themes that may hit home for some people  All in all  I thought it was really good  The book  The Girl on The Train  by Paula Hawkins was very suspenseful  Megan Watson is an extreme alcoholic she hates that she is and she hates herself  She believes that she means nothing to anyone and finds herself very unattractive  She takes train from Ausbury London to Euston London every day for work  She passes many houses on the way to her work  One of which was her old house which her ex husband and his wife live with their child now  But a few houses down from her old house  she notices a couple who sits on their porch every time she passes by their house  She sees them as a golden couple Rachel starts to watch them every single day when she passes the house  Whenever she passes their house they re either being lovey dove you or being deep into a conversation with one another  She refers to them as Jess Jason but in reality their names are Megan and Scott  One day Megan goes missing Rachel might have the answers on why she went missing  But there are many people up for questioning  Who had the answers on where Megan was and if she was still alive  This book makes you realize that you can t even trust the people closest to you   OVA RECENZIJA JE OBJAVLJENA NA PORTALU

pozelecete da svi cuju za nju  Nop  I don t get the hype  I can understand that it has become a popular book  as it is fast reading and quite entertaining  but it s just that  I could also see some similarities with  Gone Girl   but it s not the same  Yes  here you also have that thing abound how looks can be deceiving and  as the story evolve  you start changing your opinion about the characters  And there is also a mystery  But that s it  So this story begins with Rachel  on her daily commute to London by train  we will later learn what all those train travels are about   thinking about her ruined life  the way her marriage ended  the next drink she s going to take  Everyday the train passes the same places and houses  stops at the same signal  Rachel likes to see the houses and daydream about a particular couple who seem to embody everything Rachel s marriage to Tom was not  They seem happy  they seem to be in love  What s there not to envy  Until one day  Rachel sees something out of the ordinary and starts thinking something is very wrong  And then a woman goes missing  And Rachel believes her disappearance is linked to what she saw   The Girl on the Train  his told by three female narrators  the alcoholic Rachel  Megan  a woman with many dark secrets on her past  and Anna  Rachel s substitute in marriage to Tom  As we read their narratives  how the story went from their perspective  we feel a shift in the way we feel about these women  I mean  Rachel was pretty obnoxious in the beginning  and for most part of the book  always making wrong decisions  and drinking to the point of passing out and not remembering anything the next day  I didn t really warm up to Rachel  but  at the end  I liked her a little bit more than I did in the beginning Anna is not as innocent as we initially believe  She feels harassed by Rachel  as Rachel doesn t seem to know how to let go of Tom  but she has her share of guilty in the ending of Tom s previous marriage As for Megan  I just found her tiresome  Her femme fatale ways were on the eye rolling side  Then there are the men  Tom  Rachel s ex husband and Anna s current husband  and Scott  Megan s husband  Without going into details  allow me to say that none of them is what they seem to be And this five people are all connected  Between them and to the woman who disappears  And we will follow Rachel while she tries to understand everything that happened and is affecting her  With the insights from Megan and Anna  we manage to understand the whole story  which we wouldn t only by Rachel s point of view But here s the thing  as we start knowing more about the characters  their pasts and secrets  the more obvious it becomes who the guilty one is  And when the revelation arrives  is not as mind blowing as one would expect  Yes  the story is predictable Still  as I said in the beginning  the story is fast paced  very easy to read  entertains  there is mystery  It is a page turner  I won t deny it  A rather predictable one  but still enjoyable enough for me to give it three stars and a half  round them up to four  and not feel guilty about it I just don t really get the hype  Es un libro que te cautiva   que te atrapa  que mantiene tu mente todo el tiempo pensando en que pude pasar     con personajes muy bien estructurados y un ritmo perfecto   en pocas palabras es un libro maravilloso   sin duda vale la pena leerlo  Suspenseful and engagingCouldn t put this book down  Easy  suspenseful read and loved the Characters  Loved the twists in this book and how the author made you feel sympathy and dislike for each character  This fast paced psychological thriller captivated my attention from start to finish  Three women whose lives unintentionally intersect tell their stories in a series of not always chronological vignettes  The reader is privy to each woman s journey of self discovery  learning the happier and the grittier aspects of their personalities and life events   Something bad happened   as one of the women states  and slowly the revelations add up till the reader discovers what that was  And then the really scary stuff happens  Ms  Hawkins reveals each woman s life in a way that makes the reader always want more  For me it was almost too suspenseful  but I enjoyed the characters very much  The ending was a complete surprise  even though I thought I had it figured out a couple of times Readers who like suspenseful mysteries that get into people s minds will enjoy this book  Those who want a fast  engrossing book will find it here  Anyone who enjoys reading about the more challenging aspects of women s lives and relationships  or who has felt a little crazy when things that people tell them don t quite feel right will be able to relate to this book  4 5 Stars  I m connected  I am no longer just a girl on the train  going back and forth without point or purpose   This was a very exciting suspenseful read that kept a great pace and my attention till the very last line  The author tells the story through mainly Rachel s pov along with some chapters of Megan and Anna s povs  I was unable to but this book down till I finished and would definitely recommend friends who enjoyed books like Gone Girl to give it a go  Rachel is a flawed heroine who I just adored while the story keeps moving her drinking causes black outs and she inserts herself into a missing woman s case that she may or may not be connected to  This is a story that readers should just go in blind and simply enjoy the ride    One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl  four for a boy  five for silver  six for gold  seven for a secret never to be told  I ve got a few of those      My Review  Normally I m a little hesitant to jump wholeheartedly into a book that has so much acclaim so quickly  I m always afraid that the book won t live up to my heightened expectations   which sadly is often the case  As an avid reader I ve read a lot of suspense and I can t help that my mind is constantly trying to find little clues throughout the text so I can solve the crime sooner than the author wants it revealed  I m a Sherlock Holmes wannabe  I had a hard time being the amateur sleuth this time because the author has written such complex characters  each with their own baggage and plausible motives that I kept changing my mind as to who was the culprit Hawkins also kept my interest throughout  no small feat  with all of the red herrings that she threw at me  I admit that I guessed  who dunnit  about three quarters of the way through but  that said  I also guessed a handful of people before that so I suppose my  guess  wasn t  right  per se as it was eventual This book has been compared to Gone Girl and Before I Go To Sleep but I think that The Girl on the Train was a much better read than both of those books and that has a lot to do with the characters  The story is told from three points of view   Rachel  Megan and Anna  Each of these women have certain likable traits and many traits that were quite repellent and offensive  Normally if the main characters are totally unlikable  ie Gone Girl  I have a hard time getting behind them  I don t want to read about someone who has no redeeming qualities  That wasn t the case with this book  Hawkin s characters were very layered and defined even if some of their choices  namely Rachel s decision to keep her nose in things  were a little questionable naive  But as you see what these women have lived through the reason for their choices becomes clearer This book is a very impressive debut thriller with complex characters all with their own secrets to hide  It goes to show that you should never assume you know a person and also gives you the eerie feeling that you can t trust anyone  This was quite an addicting read  Hats off to Ms Hawkins for keeping my wandering mind solidly on her plot and interesting character choices  My Rating  4 5 stars   This book review  as well as hundreds more  can also be found on my blog  The Baking Bookworm  www thebakingbookworm blogspot ca  where I also share my favourite recipes     You know this was good because I had to tell my husband the whole plot afterwards   There s nothing so painful  so corrosive  as suspicion  This books is mind blowing and insane  Psychopathic  to be precise It tells the story of Rachel  an alcoholic  who doesn t seem to be able to get over her ex husband  who is now enjoying his life with a beautiful wife and a pretty daughter  Their family seems perfect  which is completely the opposite of what Rachel is undergoing But it doesn t stop just there  does it  There should be some plot twist  things that actually will draw the readers into the story  And yes  there is  Not just that  the twist is insane  Jess and Jason   the wonderful representation of perfection  or is that so  Megan and Scott  Rachel  Tom This book features a tangled mess  which in fact is created beautifully  It drove me crazy as it started to unfold itself  and I could hardly stop reading  The mysteriousness when he and she were used instead of names left me hanging and unsatisfied  and that was actually what made the book extremely compelling and compulsive  4 2 stars  I was not disappointed     wow  Plot really did reach my expectations  Very interesting and it is a really good book  Must admit I was hiding the book under my books for college and was taking mini brakes so i can read it  I do that only with good books  Is it just me or do people guess from the start who the bad guy is  Was it that predictable  Maybe because i watch to many episodes of Criminal mind i am really good at guessing this   Really liked how the author describe alcoholic problem which Rachel had  that constant desire for every sip of it What I did not like was that here relationships are described less with emotions more with desire  I mean every relationship  Rach and Tom  Tom and Anna  Jess and Jason  lol   Maybe its just me but it kinda had lack romantic emotions   Je ne suis pas une habituee du genre  alors j aurais bien du mal a dire si c est un bon polar ou non Par contre  je peux dire que j ai passe un excellent moment aux cotes avines de Rachel et que je me suis laissee prendre au jeu de l enquete  Il m a manque un soupcon de details pour en faire un coup de coeur    Details qui enroberaient l ambiance et le coeur des personnages Mais ce livre reste une jolie surprise   I honestly didn t have any idea that The Girl on the Train was named as  the next Gone Girl   I read Gone Girl around September last year and I really enjoyed it even I was disappointed with the ending  my review here   Yes there are some similarities because I kept on thinking Gone Girl while reading TGOTT but believe me  this book is unique and twisted on its own way The story was told from the POVs of three different women who you may or may not find likeable  If you ll ask me  I didn t like any of them  including the men  but I was symphatetic at times  I understand their reasons and most of them are unacceptable  Each one of the characters has their own flaws  unique personalities and deep secrets to tell  Kudos to the author for doing a great job on giving the characters their own voices  I was able to identify easily who is who The writing style is compelling  A bit slow in the beginning but not in a way that you want to put it down  Just in case you did put it down  please pick it up and start again  I liked that the flashbacks and alternate POVs didn t confuse me  Also  I personally like reading books with first person POVs and written in journal type style so it s a plus for me  As for the mystery part  I didn t guess who the real culprit was  Not even on my top three  The big revelation towards the end made my heart beat fast  I didn t see that one coming Not a perfect five because I have some questions or doubts about Rachel s blackout issues  Also  the last few pages were intense but felt a bit rushed for me and a little out of character  But all in all  I m satisfied with the ending This was an amazing novel  I highly recommend this book whether you liked Gone Girl or not  Like what I ve said  The Girl on the Train is unique and twisted on its own way No wonder why this book won the Best Mystery   Thriller in Goodreads Choice Awards 2015  Great book with a great suspense     I read it in three days  Really exciting Grande libro con un ottima suspance    lo ho letto in 3 giorni  Davvero appassionante I agree with my friend didn t like any of the characters  However  I couldn t put it down      It would be a lie if you say that you haven t met someone that resembles the characters in this story In 36 years   I ve met more than a couple of alcoholics I ve not been part of it but shure I ve been close to domestic violence I ve known a lot of unfaithful people  men and women  some are my friends still I ve known some women that have gone a little crazy in the head from being in a  relationship  I ve met liars  When friends judge constantly other people s failed marriages  I know they have a failed one too So   If you really really knew what happens inside the privacy of the lives of everyone you know   would it be wrong to say I ve met a killer   Quite a page turner  give it a read before it comes out as a film  Fun  Not the NEW GONE GIRL that media seems to want it to be  and not necessarily worth the 661 person hold list at the library  but a definite page turner  I figured it out relatively early  but still enjoyed watching it unfold  Would I have read it in a day if I hadn t had the world s longest hair appointment during which to kill time  No one knows     Um imponente thriller  forte e encorpado pela

book gossip columns and must read sections for past few months  Everywhere i turn there was news of this book or somebody s update about reading it or wanting to read it  So i finally boarded this train that everybody was talking about  After reading the book i am kind of in the middle of agreeing with all these appreciations and not being that impressed too The book from the get go is pure content based  Everything that is good to the book is basically because of the strong content added and enhanced by equally powerful characters  Each character in the book is strongly inclined to give you sleepless nights The whole book has a very dark and melancholic ambiance to it  It is sad  The plight of each characters is sad so be prepared to be swarmed by a tsunami of cold  dark emotionsThe only point where the book failed to make a mark on me was at its narration  It is kind of choppy and not smooth to ease you into the book  it keeps breaking in between but once you get to the depth of the story you can hardly notice as you start getting immersed with the lives of these characters mentioned in the book  Language is good and sharp  characters and basic plot powerful and interesting  Definitely serves up on high quotient of thriller making it a good read after you get attached to the core of the bookIf you haven t heard yet then let me enlighten you that the book is already a NYT bestseller and it is being converted to a movie pretty soon and that should say something about the book   right  The book is high on rich characters and they make this book shine  Each characters even in passing stirs you pretty good  The book does not go into unnecessary details and stick to the direct path of the core plot  The narration is where i had trouble because it is kind of dwindling in and out of events and places  The whole book is sombre and you need to be prepared for the sad and grey sky hovering over the book but all in all it does justify the hype it has been collecting because at the end of the day it was a good thrilling read for me   I had to see what the hype was all about  and was given the book by the publisher  but I did not read any reviews prior to reading other than  It s the next Gone Girl   It s a good thriller suspense  and better than Gone Girl  and it s more than that  It deals with alcoholism  infidelity  infertility  trust and self worth issues  I can see these being hot buttons for many women while reading  Most will feel better about themselves and their situations after reading this book  ALL the main characters range from hot mess to despicable  I usually find it challenging to read a book when there s no one to root for  but I was sucked in fast and very much wanted to find out who done it and powered through  There were a number of twists that i did see coming  but not so far in advance  Read it in one weekend  which says a lot  for me   Paula Hawkins  psychological thriller   The Girl on the Train  has received a significant amount of praise since its release in January  I definitely feel like this work of fiction lives up to the hype  The mystery begins with Rachel  a divorced  alcohol dependent PR consultant who catches the same train to London every day  The train route travels past a set of suburban houses  where Rachel fantasizes about the lives being led within  One day she witnesses an event along the train line and it changes her course in life forever Due to Rachel s issues with alcohol abuse  we as the reader deal with a really unreliable narrator as we become increasingly skeptical and unsure whether her version of events are correct I won t say any more for fear of spoiling the ending  although I will say that this book is full of intrigue  suspense and had me on the edge of my seat  A very enjoyable work of mystery within the crime thriller genre  well done Paula Hawkins   While Rachel is not the most sympathetic protagonist  drunks usually aren t  her story is a fascinating one  Interesting approach in this book to weave the viewpoints together of the major participants  Lots of false leads  red herrings  and the self centered perspectives that people often have combine for an interesting mystery and a fascinating read   I was the woman on the train reading The Girl On The Train  all the way from Rochester to Carmarthen  and it certainly kept me occupied  So occupied I entirely failed to notice the Severn Tunnel  Certainly no complaints about the pace  and if you want an in depth autopsy of the condition of alcoholism  this spares nothing  and left me determined to be a teetotaller   maybe tomorrow I liked the language  the setting  the idea of using fantasised lives seen from a train   I ve been doing that for years  What I found harder to like were the characters  or more specifically  the women  I did sympathise with Rachel  but I craved for a glimpse of a woman  somewhere in there  whose dreams and schemes weren t focussed entirely on beg  borrow or stealing the man she wants  There are some women in the world with a bit more creative purpose and self respect  Just one would do   although the charitable act of sisterly togetherness at the end almost redressed the balance for me   There are no sympathetic characters in this book  But the story is so surprising and well conceived  it matters less that every character in the book is a screw up  Well worth reading   The Girl on the Train is a fun read  but I m not exactly sure why  It seems a bit plodding for the first 80  of the book  but I was compelled to keep reading  waking in the middle of the night with thoughts of the story swirling around in my head  The writing is  in my opinion  immature and un remarkable  and the story is a predictable  who dunnit   I don t read many mystery thriller type books  but I figured out the  who dunnit  several chapters before the writer revealed it  which was almost disappointing  I generally like to read fairly slowly  making sure I absorb every word the author chose to use in a novel  but with this book I found myself skipping sentences and skimming parts of paragraphs  I give the book 3 1 2 stars rounding up to 4   because it was still fun to read  but if you wondering if you should read another book on your  To read  list first  go ahead and put this one at a lower priority   it does not leave you with any gems of beauty  emotion or thought after you ve read it  REVIEW TO COME I really need to read more thrillers  as I am the perfect target market  I am slightly clueless at figuring out who is the culprit  only at the 70  mark did I figure out who s who in this book  and this means that I get completely swept up in the suspense This book is constantly compared to Gone Girl  and while there are similarities I enjoyed Girl on the Train so much more  I wont go into detail about the storyline because I think it has been reviewed enough times but would like comment on the 3 main characters Rachel   She s an alcoholic  she s lost her job and obsesses over Tom  her ex  Sometimes she drinks to the point of blacking out and this makes her an unreliable narrator  I really felt sorry for her and my sympathies were reserved mostly just for her Megan   It is clear early on that she is even more mentally unstable than Rachel and the more I read about her the less I liked her  Enough said Anna   I struggled to really get a feel for Anna and her character came across as flat and a bit shallow and I have to admit that at times I relished in feelings of schadenfreude at Anna s insecurities about her marriage  The men in the story never felt as well crafted as the women but I thought they were still woven in well enough without coming across as only bit players This is a VERY impressive debut novel worth all the hype that surrounds it  If you re not afraid of imperfect characters struggling with depression  loneliness  rejection  addiction  infidelity and dishonesty all wound into a pretty intriguing murder mystery  then give this book a try  It s hard to believe that this is the author s first book  She nailed it  It was impossible to put down and had a very unique premise  Deeply flawed characters and unexpected connections  For anyone who liked Gone Girl or other Gillian Flynn books  you ll devour this one  If I could  I would rate this book a 4 5Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning  She sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough  Now everything s changed  Unable to keep it to herself  Rachel offers what she knows to the police  and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next  as well as in the lives of everyone involved  Has she done more harm than good I thought this book was very good  suspenseful  and a real page turner  Rachel is annoying with her drinking and I wanted to shake her to stop but I never had a problem with drinking so maybe I don t understand  now fatty foods I understand   Paula Hawkins does a very good job with making you second guess everything and everyone  In one chapter you think you figured out the mystery and then boom  she throws something at you and you guess something else  If you like mysteries then I would suggest reading this   The Girl On the Train  2015 Paula Hawkins  I m guessing 1970 ish   Thriller  323 pp  Summer 2013  Witney  a London suburb on

edilebilir olsa da  Olay Rachel in surekli bindigi trende gozunu koydugu bir evdeki cifte takmasiyla basliyor ve arkasindan gelenler tam bir karmasa  Iliskiler  yalanlar  acilar    Ama kitabin bir yerinde neyin ne oldugunu hafiften cakmaya basliyorsunuz orasi kesin  Buna ragmen iyiydi  elimden birakamadim bir turlu   Several people recommended this book to me  and I understand why  It is a page turner  I didn t figure it out until a key piece of evidence is given near the end  then I slapped my hand to my forehead and said  well  duh The most interesting aspect of this book is the author s choice to create a large cast of unlikable characters  None of them are particularly likeable  none  And even in the end  none are very redeemed  But it works Possible spoilers     I had issues with a few loose ends not being tied up  like who leaked the info from Megan s past  was it the doc trying to get himself out of the spotlight   and the phone they found in Megan s pocket   did she have two on her that night  The police mentioned she had one in her pocket  but how did the other end up in the gym bag  Why did the killer only take the one  I also would have liked the police  especially the bitchy one Riley  to have made amends but as I said  none of the characters were likable  except the baby  and none were redeemed  I don t think for a second Anna helped Rachel out of the goodness in her heart or because it was the right thing to do   no  that was all self preservation But it was a good read and I enjoyed it  The Girl on the Train debuted at the top of the NYT list  something almost unheard of for a first book  Necessarily that called for a lot of pre publication hype and the usual comparisons to Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl  I have never read Gone Girl and generally avoid books so extensively hyped  In the case of The Girl on the Train though  I found the book s premise almost irresistible  Rachel commutes to London daily and has taken to watching a couple who live in a house close to the tracks  They appear to have an idyllic life and Rachel dubs them  Jess and Jason   One day Rachel sees something quite shocking from the train and hears the next day that  Jess   actually named Megan  is missing  Rachel feels that she must tell the police what she saw  But if she does will she do more harm than good Told in the alternating voices of Rachel  Megan and the new wife of Rachel s ex  Anna  The Girl on the Train kept me riveted throughout  That is no small feat considering that each narrator is not only entirely unreliable but also entirely unlikable  Rachel is an alcoholic who has let everything in her life go after the break up of her marriage  She lives in a fantasy land and is making no attempt to straighten herself out  I did have a little sympathy for her but none for Megan or Anna  The Girl on the Train is a gem of plotting and a twisted tale that will keep you guessing from beginning to end I recommend The Girl on the Train highly RATING  4 5 Stars I don t know what to think about this book  It s about a girl named Rachel who catches the same commuter train Every morning   She knows it will wait at the same signal each time   overlooking a row of back gardens   She s even started to feel like she knows the people who live in one of the houses  Jess  Jason   she calls them UNTIL she sees smth shocking   and everything changed now she has a chance to become a part of the lives she s only watched from afar This book has been UPS ans downs to me   there are some pages that i really admired and others i couldn t help but skipping them Overall   its amazing   the story is well written   you can see it through 3 different perspectives which is absolutely amazing and at the same time tiring   you need full concentration  I loved the description   characters  the suspense   the places   the emotions and most importantly the twist Cant wait till the movie comes out  Rating   4 5 stars  C est une histoire tres poignante avec un deroulement assez inattendu  Ca change beaucoup des policiers que j ai l habitude de lire  Les personnages sont tous bien developpes  Rachel est particulierement complexe   on a envie de la secouer  mais on est triste pour elle mais en meme temps elle est souvent insupportable   C est assez etrange  J ai eu du mal a rentrer dans l histoire  la faute a la periode des fetes et du peu de temps que je disposais pour lire  Je suis persuadee que si j avais ete plus dispo  je l aurai lu en quelques jours   En bref  un tres bon roman bien ficele   A physiological thriller that once you start reading  you can t put down  At first I wasn t so keen on her writing style  But a dozen or so pages into it I forgot all about that I was so pulled into the story  So many twists and turns  I highly recommend this one    4 5 stars   The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins was released last week and is already being called  the next Gone Girl by many reviewers  Rachel catches the same train into London each day and enjoys looking at the houses that go by and imagining the lives of those inside  One day  she sees something that will set an entire chain of events rolling which steadily build to a thrilling climax I can understand why early readers of The Girl on the Train are comparing it to Gone Girl  as it contains first person perspective from   in this case  several   female characters and is a thriller with a cracking pace  I enjoyed the flawed characters and the urban tension was palpable I groaned out loud at certain peak points in the novel when characters behaved against my advice  don t you hate that   and didn t see any of the events coming  I also didn t work out  whodunnit  either  which makes for an entertaining read The Girl on the Train is an impressive debut and I very much look forward to watching this author in the future  Udah lama nggak baca thriller yang bisa bikin begadang saking penasarannya Walaupun  seperti kata orang orang  Rachel ini narator yang nggak reliable  tapi narasinya berhasil bikin saya pengin cepet cepet tahu siapa dalang sebenarnya 4 bintang  Looks like this is going to be the  Gone Girl  of 2015    it s gone totally viral  Amazon has gone out of stock at least once  lots of book clubs are reading it  wait lists are hundreds of people deep at the libraries    so  is it worthy of all the hype Yes   it s certainly not a great piece of literature  but it s an extremely addictive  popcorn thriller    perfect for a beach or vacation read  Several of us read this as part of a book club buddy read and many of us finished it in a couple of days  It s an easy read and hard to put down I won t recount the plot or give anything away  I would recommend that you stay away from reviews  the less you know going in  the better  It will keep you guessing for sure Read it and enjoy  Fun   This book reminded me of GONE GIRL but way better  The story is very mysterious and exciting  but everyone in the story is terrible  and the whole story is abnormal and brutal  It is sad  that the people want to read so sad and depressive stories  But the style of the novel is good  you must read it to the end  and every time think about the possible solutions    Pero que buen libro joder  Personalmente pienso que si un libro te logra transmitir emociones y sentimientos tan intensos como desesperacion  miedo  depresion  soledad y angustia entonces es un buen libro  La chica del tren es un libro buenisimo que consiguio todo eso y mas  Empezando por las tres mujeres que narran la historia  he de decir que   eran un completo desastre  Eran terribles  me causaban tanta lastima y pena y yo ya ni sabia en que confiar  Paula Hawkins hizo un desastre con mi cabeza  en verdad que si  Y la manera de escribir de esta mujer hizo que no quisiera parar de leer en ningun momento  desde las primeras paginas me absorbio dentro de la trama y no me solto hasta el final  Llego un momento en el que todos parecian culpables y yo empece a sospechar de medio mundo  pero entonces viene el plot twist y  boom  Todo encaja  Aunque  siento que el desarrollo del final estuvo un poco suelto y no tuvo la intensidad que yo esperaba  de todos modos disfrute y tambien sufri con esta lectura  ademas que fue la primera que lei en este genero    Reto de lectura 2015  10 Un thriller de misterio    I just want to say that this book has helped me become a more empathetic person  I am grateful for this view into the minds of people I otherwise might ve misjudged or overlooked  While it is a compelling thriller  this empathetic characterization is what really makes it   Finally got to read this to see what the fuss was all about  I get it its pretty  edge of your seat  kinda of story  I think by now every know that it s about Rachel  who is a alcoholic  who creeps on this couple for a window of her train everyday on her commute  She is a very unreliable source as you begin to see with the unraveling of this story  Something happens with the couple she is creeping on   she starts to get involved to solve what happened  I don t want to give out more because I feel if I do it might spoil it  I felt it was a solid 4 because it kept my page turning till I was done  the only thing is I felt wanting more from the ending but I totally would recommend this to others  it was a intriguing read    http   silenciosquefalam blogspot pt

 revelando assim o seu jogo de mestria na arte de compor uma historia inteligentemente bem delineada  com enredos com voltas e reviravoltas       4 5 stars  I really enjoyed this book  It was slow at times  but over all I finished it in a day and could not put it down  I m not giving it 5 stars because I was expecting a bigger twist  and the characters were so unlikable  I would recommend this to anyone who likes psychological thrillers  but I definitely prefer Gillian Flynn s novels   Though I ve read many comparisons to  Gone Girl  in reviews out there  I think it s only true as far as both present the narrative voice of an unlikable woman  A more accurate comparison would be to the work of Alfred Hitchcock  especially with the train motif and a growing feeling of dread and suspense up to the climax  Alcoholic Rachel is riding out her downward spiral on the train every weekday morning and evening  passing by the street where she used to live with her ex husand  who still resides there with his new wife and child  To distract her from this  Rachel has fixated on a husband and wife couple a few doors up who seem to embody all that she an her ex Tom used to have  When Rachel sees something off the day the wife goes missing  she gets herself tangled up in the investigation The narrative is quick and thrilling and presents the viewpoints of three women  all of them highly flawed and unlikable  but not in a way that should prevent enjoyment of the novel  The darkness in each woman has its reasons even if we don t agree with them nor would we necessarily make their choices  We have an alcoholic day drinking herself into oblivion to drive away the shame of actions done during yet another blackout  a mistress turned wife unrepentant of her actions  and a woman broken from grief caused by her own doing  The unifying factor between these women is that we cannot judge a person based upon what we see  for underlying factors run deep and can remain hidden from even those who live with each other   4 5 Bought during a vacation in Puerto Rico and kept unread much too long   There s a lot to be said for the reason this novel is a thriller and a mystery  The chapters  plot  and conflicts  as there are multiple conflicts  made it extremely hard for me to accomplish life outside of reading this novel  A main point is that two of the narrators are unreliable for several reasons  and the novel relies on their unreliability as a plot device   The novel s characters all have secrets which are uncovered through the characters  narratives  I honestly believe that the characters kept some secrets concealed  because I was left with questions even after my reading  The book s main narrator  Rachel  is an alcoholic who has lost nearly everything important in her life  her sobriety  marriage  house  job  and financial freedom  The novel s other narrator  Megan  is unreliable due to PTSD due to a tragedy during her drug addled youthful indiscretions with a drifter in the English countryside  Megan reinvents herself when she marries Scott Hipwell and settles into a middle class life in Witley  a London suburb just along the railroad tracks   Rachel and Megan s lives become intertwined when Rachel believes she was the last to see Megan alive the night she was murdered  Unfortunately  Rachel was on a night long bender and has blocked out the events  The novel follows her attempts to remember by retracing her steps  A second unfortunate point for Rachel is that her ex husband  Tom  and Megan live on the same street  Rachel s co dependancy on Tom to help her through daily life creates major conflict in the plot and as she becomes more involved in the murder mystery  their relationship becomes even more strained  I thought it very odd that ex spouses would interact the way they did  and made me believe that Tom honestly enjoyed watching his ex wife suffer and for him to be the hero of her life  while not totally involved in her day to day struggles  Tom s wife  Anna  is a Stepford wife witch of a woman  who feels Rachel invades her life just as she attempts to establish a family life with a new daughter   I won t share how Anna and Tom came to be together  because it would affect a future reader s feelings    I was surprised when the killer s identity was finally revealed and I am still turning possible thoughts as to where in the characters  stories the author left hints that I glossed over while reading  The author adds a final twist at the end which was truly shocking  I was surprised this was the author s debut because it was a page turner for me  The author does a wonderful job of unravelling the women s lives to the reader  and showing that a passing appearances are often wrong  Enough Red Herrings For A Swedish smorgasbord Rachel cannot get over the pain of losing her husband Tom to another woman  Anna  Every morning when she goes to work on the train and every evening she passes by the Victorian home she once shared with Tom  Her pain is palpable and excruciating to this reader anyway  Anyone who has experienced that level of betrayal will be moved by Rachel s pain as she watches Anna not just living in her old home  but with all of its furnishings and decoration all put together with such love and joy  such happiness in her safe  warm marriage with Tom  Their only disappointment was their inability to conceive the child Rachel so desperately wanted  They try IVF  but it fails and Tom says he hasn t the money for another round  This is the beginning of Rachel s slide in deep depression that she self medicates with liquor  finally becoming a full blown alcoholic  Her pain becomes ever more acute as one morning from the train she sees Anna  belly busting with the result of her fecundity  She is watering Rachel s roses  Rachel isn t actually going to work on the train  She was fired three months previously for returning drunk from a three hour lunch during which she grossly treated and subsequently lost a client  But she rides the train anyway to mms make her friend and roommate  Cathy  believe she has a job  A few door down from her old home there is another house  identical to Rachel s  A young couple live there  He is strong and protective  she is ethereal   elegant and blonde  Rachel names them Jason and Jess and constructs a rich  imaginative and blissful marriage for them Rachel drinks so heavily that she has blackouts  Not losing consciousness  but while chunks of time that are completely lost to her  of which she has no memory at all  But something about the tunnel beneath the train tracks brings up feelings of dread and fear  Something bad happened here  thinks Rachel Meanwhile Rachel continues to bother Tom with drunken  tearful phone calls and even goes to seek him out at their old home  which she still thinks of as hers  Tom tries his best gently to make her go away  take care of herself  go to AA  but Rachel s calls and visits continue until finally the police are brought into the matter Meanwhile  Jess has gone missing  Only Jess is actually Megan and Jason  her husband  is Scott  Rachel takes it upon herself to play detective leading her to discover to the near loss of her life  the horrifying identity of the killer  The Girl on the Train is Rachel Watson  who takes the same train daily from the suburbs into London  Stopping at the same signal along a stretch of suburban homes  Rachel has a first hand look into the life of a couple as they drink coffee on their terrace  She becomes fascinated with them and their  perfect  life to the point of giving them names  Jess and Jason  and imagining more about their lives than the daily snippets she is able to view  One of the reasons Rachel is so engrossed is because two years ago she lived in the same row of homes several doors down  until her seemingly wonderful life fell apart  She can t help but imagine that Jess and Jason are living the life she once adored  But one day she sees something shocking on her daily ride that turns her life upside down This story is told over a period of four months  with brief flashbacks to a year before  It is written in the form of dated reflections beginning with the main character  Rachel  but quickly adding thoughts from two other women  Megan and Anna  Interspersed through each character s thoughts are details of their past  bringing them to the present day  This is definitely a psychological drama and thriller  I would recommend readers set aside a good block of time to begin this book because it can be somewhat confusing until all of he characters are introduced  I didn t do this and found myself rereading to get names and dates in proper focus  After that  it was hard for me to put this book down  I felt compelled to find out the ending  I would recommend this to all readers who enjoy a thrilling drama allowing the reader to journey through the minds of its characters  A great page turner  and I enjoyed the revelations as they happened  Interesting to read Rachel s awareness increasing as she searched and kept searching for the answers to what had happened  and what she had seen  and the adjustments to what she understood to be true  Paula Hawkins captures the voices of the main characters well  I thought  possibly the two main male characters were a bit too similar  but that s the only quibble   and it was fairly plausible too  and very evocative of London   I love the sense of place that I gained from the novel The story contains enough tension and complexity to remain interesting  without being overly complex  Unlike some thriller type books  not all the characters are not horrible either  so I wasn t left thinking I didn t care what happened really  say  as I did in Gone Girl    I was hoping for some resolutions  And in that sense  the ending wrapped things up well  without being too neat  A satisfying read   This book is all about lies  Are they good  or are they inherently bad  Is it okay to lie if you are doing it for someone else s benefit  and wrong if it is for your own  What if you are in danger Maybe you aren t lying enough Rachel witnesses something from her vantage point on the 8 04 train to London and becomes embroiled in a mystery that she has no place to be solving  What follows is an agonizing thriller that takes place in the corners of a drunken blacked out mind and in the sinister smiles of potential criminals  Read this  but make sure you have time to read it in one sitting  Livro com boa trama mas o que mais me chamou a atencao foi a tematica da violencia domestica e como as vitimas muitas vezes se sentem culpadas pelo discursos de  protecao  do agressor Questoes sociais colocadas no livro sem pieguice e de maneira adequada  Personagens bem construidos mas acredito que a linguagem cinematografica comprometeu a linguagem literaria  Nitidamente o livro ja nasceu roteiro de um filme   I received this book in a good reads giveaway I ll admit  I actually couldn t figure this one out  I was a little surprised by the end and who had done what  I started this book on Saturday afternoon  and finished it Sunday morning  It was a quick  but intense read  I highly enjoyed this one  though I wanted to smack some of the characters   Rachel included as some of the things she did  you just knew were going to lead to trouble Compelling thriller   read it almost in one sitting  Very much in the vein of Gone Girl  I m sure Hawkins is fed up with hearing that    first person narratives  diaries moving backwards and forwards around the event  lots of red herrings I was maybe a bit disappointed with the final reveal  but thrillers are so often like that   it s easier to write build up than satisfactorily deliver on it  And it was one of the very few books where I ve been put off by the unlikeable characters   I hardly ever notice that  but I just couldn t stand Anna  Rachel   Megan I was fine with  and they were the main narrators  so it didn t really matter The characters were a bit forgettable generally  I found it hard to tell them apart  to be honest  Probably because they were all first person  but the writing style didn t change enough to be really recognisable I suppose  Not going to win any prizes for great literary style  but deserves a lot of the hype for a great thriller  Left me a bit negative about relationships  though  Not a happy Christmas read  but definitely good for airports and  of course  trains  hli mli     baapre baap    shess krte jaan ber hiyyaa gese    prcnndd dhiir gtir bi     khttmtte anubaad    et naam ddaak hise blei ksstt kre shess krlaam      I loved the narration for this book  Each character had a different actress and they performed their roles well  The print book had a lot of holds at the library and when I looked through the other formats  the audiobook had a copy available for checkout  A well written  suspenseful story with interesting characters and similar themes running through  marriage and children   I didn t really expect the conclusion  which made it a good mystery  I absorbed the book better as I listened to it and am not sure if I would have had the same level of comprehension if I read it  Though I did get a bit confused with the dates and the flashbacks  Overall  I would recommend this title   I would have given it 5 stars  but it started off slow for me  I love the ride this book took me through  Actually 3 7 5 starsI loved the psychoanalysis in this book  Every character was morally ambiguous  obsessed with something and really flawed  They all had their own problems  their own sins and their own troubled pasts to chase them  I love characters with troubled pasts and morally ambiguous characters so I just got really attached to this part of the book  The main character was the exact opposite of a detective  She was an alcoholic  fat and antisocial  who had a very vivid imagination but for some reason  she was really open minded and when her memory was helping her  she could realize things in seconds  I actually came to like her but also pity her a lot  not only because nobody liked her and because everybody was unfair to her but because she destroyed her life in a very bad way Another thing that is worth mentioning is that this book made me understand better the whole theory that alcoholism is as bad as drug addiction  Rachel s life as an alcoholic was poor  she couldn t even take care of herself  she had a very bad memory loss she repelled everybody  When she was sober  though  she was clever and persistent and this by itself proves how harmful alcohol can be The thing that made me decide to rate this book with 3 7 stars was the mysery thriller aspect  murder  It may be that I don t understand exactly the meaning of Psychological Thriller  It s supposed to be a thriller with morally ambiguous characters and complex psychological aspects  which was really good in this book  but also it should be able to create psychological horror and make you unable to sleep because you want to see what happened  Unfortunately  this did not affect me at all  Not only I didn t feel connected to the mystery the story had but I also found the killer before it was revealed who he was  note that my friends were surprised about that  I just felt that some fantasy  YA books I read had more action and mystery than that  But as I said  I probably just don t understand the whole Psychological Thriller genre that much Idk if I should recommend it  do what you want  The writing is addictive though  so you may like it   Mary Oh  wow  It s hard to give a dark book 4 stars  but it kept me riveted from the start  It was my spring break read and did not disappoint  I read this faster than I have read a book in a long time  It s been compared to Gone Girl and I think I liked that one better in the end because there were times in this book when I thought  ok  get on with it  After reading this  I needed a drink  Need to find an uplifting book to follow this one   I get the comparisons to Gone Girl but to me Gone Girl had several psychos that you had to deal with all at the same time which made the whole thing feel crazy   this one is more eerie and the pacing was totally different  The main thing that the two have in common is the dark view of the marriages involved  the dysfunction upon dysfunction in both were similar  The thing I liked best about this was the unreliable narrator stuff  I didn t get into the baby pregnancy obsession stuff  but that s just not my deal  The cadence and the voice were quite similar to Gillian Flynn s  Gone Girl   as well as the type of mystery having a similar feel  however  I loved it  I flew through the crazy mystery and the sharp twists and turns of the plot held my attention throughout  The story will shock you and keep you intrigued up until the finale  I truly recommend this book for those who want a fairly easy  however suspenseful  read  Hmmm   It s been a while since I have finished this one  and after this amount of time  I feel like I would take it down to 3 stars  However  what s done is done  This was such a quick read  or listen in my case   I couldn t wait to figure out what was going on  I really don t think mysteries are my thing though  I always read through them so fast and then I am very disappointed to know the ending  I like the mystery  I hate that everything gets wrapped up so nicely in the end  That s not necessarily the book s fault though  that s just me  My favorite part of this book was everybody else s least favorite part  I LOVED the characters in this book  They were terribly flawed and kind of a train wreck to read about  but I also felt like they were realistic people and I felt a good deal of sympathy  empathy   for them  People often complain about characters in a book being terrible  but guess what  people are terrible  Overall  a good quick read although I don t know if it will go down in history as being amazingly well written  This is definitely one I would recommend to my friends who don t read quite as often  PS I also didn t find this one to be a great book club read  There really wasn t that many ideas to discuss   Now this is what I call a Mystery book One that keeps you on the edge of your seat from page 1  makes you bite your nails down to stubs and makes you wish you could pull an all nighter just to solve the mystery If it comes with a dose of unreliable narrators who make you want to pull all of your hair out  what can I say Added Bonus The Girl on the Train is everything the reviewers are raving about and a lot more  There s been a lot of comparisons of The Girl on the Train to Gone Girl  and I can sort of see why  they re both thrillers with female protagonists and unreliable narrators  but the parallels are pretty thin  I for one liked it better than Gone Girl  I found it more suspenseful  more emotional  and I liked the unreliable narrators here more  there are three narrators   I felt that they were unreliable in a normal way  like how all of us misremember things  have a slightly different perspective on an incident than the other people involved  rather than being manipulative  True  one narrator is omitting an important detail  without which the book would have been half as long and not suspenseful  but I think an omission is different than a lie  For that matter  I think it was the author  not the narrator  omitting that  That narrator certainly knew who she was talking about  even if we readers didn t So every day on her way to work  Rachel s train stops at this one spot on the tracks where Rachel can see into the backyard and kitchen of a particular house  The couple she sees there seem ideal to her  happy  loving  fun  She imagines what their lives must be like  so different from hers  She s divorced  heavily drinking  and actually not really going to work but instead going to wander around London for eight hours so her roommate won t find out she s been fired  Then one day Rachel sees something she shouldn t  And the next day  the wife is missing  She needs to tell someone  but who  and how can she get them to believe her  She gets pulled into the mystery  and it gets much more complicated than she had imagined I found the suspense that Ms  Hawkins creates so subtle and skillful that at times I almost didn t want to keep reading  because I was so worried about what would happen to Rachel  But I also was compelled to keep going  I found the depiction of someone in active alcoholism very fascinating  along with the requisite memory gaps  Rachel managed both to have mostly created her own misery  and yet be sympathetic  The three narrative characters were very interestingly drawn  three dimensional characters  who often looked very different from the other narrator s perspectives  The alternating point of view I found very effective here  Not only did it allow for showing us scenes where the main character wasn t there  but it showed how Rachel  and the others  look to outsiders  how our internal view of ourselves conflicts with how others see us  and how it s so much easier to empathize when you know a person s history  So it an action packed thrilled  but also a deep study in psychology and messed up people  An excellent escape when you need a distraction  but not fluffy or silly  It s a fast and fun read  There has been on much hype surrounding the Girl on the Train  named the next Gone Girl  it has been the most anticipated book of January 2015 and topping the number one New York Bestseller  I read Gone Girl this year  which I really enjoyed  so I knew the Girl on the Train is a must read  This book is written in the first person point of view of three unreliable narrators  Rachel  Megan and Anna  all of whom are unlikeable  no surprise   The cause of Rachel s recent divorce reduced her to becoming a depressed alcoholic and losing her job  as a result she goes on a daily commute on the train to pretend she s going to work and thus became obsessed with a  perfect  couple she sees on the terrace and she named them Jess and Jason  Megan is the girl on the terrace who succeeded in cheating and Anna is the new wife of Rachel s ex husband  It s always been said that it takes 3 seconds to make a good first impression  When you start reading the first few chapters  I began to form a judgment on Rachel  I did feel sorry for her because she couldn t pull herself together and stop drinking but her actions were a bit crazy  It gave me an impression that Rachel was lonely and to be part of something  the murder investigation  made her feel wanted  I was thinking why did she care so much about people she did not know  Who were these strangers to her  Nothing at all  Did they care  No  But once you read it  you understand the reason and the significance behind her choices  One character in particular has a dark secret  I m not going to say who it is because of spoilers  It was quite shocking and surprising to read about them  It s not what you d see coming but its something that d make the front page tabloid news  A  whodunit  storyline always entices me to keep reading  it s so addictive  Once you know where the story is heading  you won t want to put it down  Ironically  I read the first two chapters on the train  I use to go on daily train commutes to and from Art College and university  the train always had to stop midway before arriving at London Bridge for about 5 minutes or less  At that stop  there are really nice and expensive looking apartment flats with terraces  There would be no one there on the terraces but sometimes you ll catch glimpses of people in their apartment doing whatever they re doing  Sometimes  we get nosy but Rachel went a bit too far  giving Megan and Scott names and branding them a perfect couple  even though she knew absolutely nothing about them  Looks are deceiving  The Girl on the Train was not as mindfuck as Gone Girl but it was still such a fantastic read  I just couldn t stop reading and kept me at the edge of my seat  I needed to know what happened  There were several people who you d speculate and I only worked it out just before it was revealed  It kept me guessing a lot on whodunit because it wasn t clear who was the culprit but then it all came together in a plot twist  I find it hard to believe that this is Paula Hawkin s first book  If you enjoyed Gone Girl  then you will definitely love the Girl on the Train   view spoiler  I don t know the significance of the redheaded guy on the train  It turns out he was just a minor character  he was there was nothing  I didn t agree with what the therapist did  What he was told was in confidence and he violated that confidentially  There was something about this therapist  He seems to be very good at his job  in way that when he talks to you  you feel under his spell because Megan and Rachel were very captivated by him   hide spoiler   If I could replace the title of this book it s The PsychopathsI know that it is a cliche book with as my suggested title implies  all of them are psychopaths thus making almost all of them as suspects  But if you are mixing a darker color with another it gets more darker  or mixing tons of exotic foods together is weirder The romance in this book  makes the atmosphere a tad bit darker as opposed to YA novels which make their novels lighter  A MUST READ  UNPUTDOWNABLE  READ IT BEFORE THE MOVIE COMES OUT  AND TREAT THE MOVIE AS ANOTHER MEDIUM FOR THE STORY   Fast and fun  I give The Girl on the Train a generous four stars for being such a quick compelling read   I admit to reading this book in the grocery store line  waiting rooms  and at red lights in traffic  It didn t want to be put down  Almost a Gone Girl meets Bridget Jones as a strung out lush  Also fairly predictable   almost formulaic mystery book script  But that didn t make it any less enjoyable  If you are like me  every once in a while you go for a cheeseburger and fries which tastes great going down   but it s a meal easily forgotten  Kind of like The Girl on the Train  Treat yourself to a fast read and then move on  We have officially entered the Gone Girl era of novels  The mysteries are crazier  the murders more gruesome  and the psychological suspense has been ramped up to the max  The Girl on the Train follows Rachel a 30 something divorcee  Her ex husband left her for another woman and she is struggling to cope with a divorce that happened a couple years ago  Every day Rachel rides the train past her and her ex husbands house and slowly she becomes engrossed in the lives of a woman and her husband who live down the street from her former home  Rachel makes up a happy life and names  Jess and Jason  for the people who share the house  But when Jess turns up missing Rachel knows she has to help find her I struggled to get through the first 80 pages of this book and it was because I didn t like Rachel  She was a drunk and I  much like her flatmate  just wanted Rachel to get her life together  But  as the novel progressed and I got to know Rachel better I really came to like her  I loved learning more about her past and how it has effected her present  I also loved the fact that she was an unreliable narrator it made the mystery that much better Overall  The Girl on the Train was a psychological thriller at its finest  After a little bit of a stumble the mystery drew me in and I had to know what was going to happen next  I m already looking forward to reading whatever Paula Hawkins writes next   This was a pretty good story and I loved the audio narration  I don t typically read mysteries  and if I did  I m not sure if I would ve understood all of the hype  The ending dragged out wayyyy too long in my opinion also  Overall I was eager to get to reading listening everyday and would read another story by this author  Remember how the suspenseful movie  Fatal Attraction  with Glen Close and Michael Douglas turned to horror at the end  That is how I feel about this book  It successfully maintains the suspense throughout the whole book  I was not disappointed in the ending  a clever bit of storytelling  4 5 starsHad me guessing the entire time  Well written with a wonderfully twisted and layered plot  I couldn t put it down  hard not to use the cliche  but this novel is a wild train ride  at least three times did I change my mind on who was behind this whodunit  4 starsThis is my first thriller and I really liked it  I really didn t know if I was going to be into this kind of genre  but to be honest  the story kept me so intrigued at all times  I was really into how the author narrated this book  we have three different pov from three very different women  One of the girls  pov was in another timeline than the two other  and it was so interesting  because it slowly began to intertwine with the two other girls  pov  and slowly  everything was starting to make sense  Although at the beginning it was a little bit slow for me  I just loved how the story started  and how it developed  it had a very well explained background with lots of flashbacks that made you understand just how messed up these characters were  and it worked perfectly This wasn t very predictable  Although  at the end  it was kind of hinted who was the  bad person  and I really thought it was just something to trick the reader  so I was quite disappointed when it was actually that person  Also  I felt that the climax scene the reader was waiting to unfold since the beginning  was actually kind of fast  and it was resolved very easily  I mean  it was awesome to read but  I felt like I needed something else from that ending  Nevertheless  it was still shocking to know what actually happened  There were some things left unanswered  or at least I think  but not essential things that really bugged me  and I guess  since I m new to this genre  sometimes things are left purposely as a mystery  Anyway  I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK  It was definitely a page turner  and it really kept you at the edge of your seat  once you start finding out major plot points   Unpredictable ending  Ternyata orang yg paling deket dengan kita bisa jadi pembunuh    Dengan alur yang cepat dan PoV dari 3 orang perempuan yg ternyata berkaitan langsung dengan si pembunuh      trage start maar zeker de moeite waard om verder te lezen aanrader It had a lot of twists and turns and kept me intrigued  Some parts were a little too drawn out but I also wanted to find out what happened   I really enjoyed this book  Couldn t put it down and raced through it  I figured out the who dunnit fairly early on  but that didn t make it any less enjoyable  Liked the first person narration from the three female characters very much  Everyday on the train into London  Rachel Watson looks out the window at the houses that fly by  She is especially intrigued by a couple that lives by the train tracks near her old home that she shared with her ex husband  Tom  She calls this couple  Jess and Jason  and she thinks they are absolutely perfect  The irony is not lost on her that Tom lives a few houses down with his new wife  Anna  and their new baby  She isn t over her ex husband and finds solace in alcohol  Her drinking has cost her more than her marriage though  It has even cost her her job  so now she rides the train to London everyday to keep up appearances and to get her roommate off her back  One day on the commute into London  she sees Jess with another man  This sparks Rachel s interest  because how could this infidelity happen  They seemed perfect together  or so she thought  Then she finds out  Jess  or Megan Hipwell  has gone missing  Rachel takes it upon herself to report what she saw to the police  but then things sort of get out of hand when Rachel remembers in a drunken haze that she was on Megan s street the night that she disappeared  To complicate things even more  she had a run in with Tom and Anna that night as well  The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is an edge of your seat debut that fans of Gone Girl will love  There are many twists and turns  unreliable narrators and a serious of who done it moments that will keep readers guessing Read the rest of my review here  http   www confessionsofabookaddict c    AMAZING  I casually walked into Waterstone during lunch  and this book was staring at me from a distance  I had no idea about the hype about this book  until I bought it and read the reviews  I was pretty excited at that point  and couldn t wait to finish work and ironically read the book on the train on my way home  And I did just that  I am also one of the many who analyse others from the train  but not quite as far as to invent other s lifestyle   I am not that creative  There are three narrators in this book  and all three can not be trusted   in fact no one can be  Rachel s  the main narrator  love life and work life has fallen apart  and so she finds happiness in a couple who she watches from the train every morning and evening  But what happens when she sees something that disturbs her happy couple fantasy  She automatically feels involved   She wants to set it right  knowing that it doesn t concern her  At first it felt as if she was filling a void in herself  but maybe it is more than that  now it is not just about what she saw but about her drunken memory She knows something is horribly wrong   Something dark and scary has happened but she cannot remember  A beautifully fast paced written book of three personalities and behaviors  Paula Hawkins has wonderfully understood and portrayed the real world problem that no one is innocent  everyone has a past and everyone has secrets I think comparing this book to Gone Girl is a bit of a let down  Although I enjoyed reading Gone Girl  I was also getting quickly bored of it too   it was too slow for me  personally   Whereas The Girl on the Train I read much faster  And not only that  I felt that the twists in The Girl on the Train was a little more gripping than the one twist in Gone Girl  I read Gone Girl for the story  and believe the movie was actually better  In comparison  The Girl on the Train was a real enjoyable read  the plots  the different characters and secrets kept me interested  Definitely give it a go  If you liked Gone Girl  you will probably like this  It s written in a similar fashion  with a similar story line  and just as unlikable characters  I couldn t put it down  After the beginning  it was well paced and suspenseful  Lots of twists  Let me just put this out there  The characters in this book are horrible  I felt no sympathy towards all of them  Megan particularly got on my nerves  However  the book in general was a pleasant surprise for me  The memories shifting like shadows  and I wonder  why am I doing this  What purpose does it serve  I liked the writing  and I liked the general plot  To be honest at first I wasn t really feeling the whole voyeur thing  I still ain t but I felt like it worked  So  no complaints  Now the characters  I hated them all  Plain simple   I always knew there was something off about that woman  At first I thought she was a bit immature  but it was more than that  she was sort of absent  Self involved  I m not going to lie   I m glad she s gone  Good riddance  I don t know if I should be proud to completely agree with Anna because she s a stuck up bitch  but I feel like she summarized Megan pretty well on this quote Lastly my reaction to every single scene where Rachel got drunk  then sick and then regretted it was of pure disbelief  I mean  how can one person cause so much damage to themselves and still do nothing about it   And then whine constantly Get your shit together girl It was  overall  a nice book  I m happy about it  I thoroughly enjoyed  The Girl on the Train   It was the first book in its genre I actually gave the chance  and I m glad I did  Even despite my not being a psychological thriller fan  I was drawn in  particularly by the three main things  the writing  the plot  and the style The Writing Paula Hawkins has a way with words  I would go so far as to say her prose wouldn t seem out of place in high literature  That being said  however  her writing is easy to understand  It isn t bogged down by over description or plot stopping internal interludes  It constantly helps to move the story forward while still adding a lyrical flare The Plot As I stated above  I m typically not a fan of the psychological thriller genre   The Girl on the Train   however  may have changed that  Hawkins pulled me in with compelling protagonists  even if they weren t likable  they were at least complex enough to make me want to understand their motives  and a foreboding undertone of darkening suspense  I was especially drawn in by Rachel s detached narration on the train  which moved the plot forward in a distinctly unique fashion The Style The first person POV of the three narrators   in a sort of journal format   lends a personal feel to the story that may not otherwise have been created with a more traditional approach  The alternating viewpoints paint a holistic version of the story that gives the reader an insight into three very different perspectives and the inner workings of each  Hawkins choice in style was spot on for the story she needed to tell Why not five stars I was annoyed by the general depiction of women  Each narrator  Megan less so than the others  is framed almost entirely in terms of the man men she is with  That is  the narrators seem to be defined exclusively by the opposite sex  All motivation stems from a sexual obsession which  though debatably accurate  I found distasteful Overall  a very good read  I definitely recommend it  4 stars  This book is pretty fucked up and I loved it  I m not really a reader of psychological thrillers  I actually think this is my first  I usually like my thrillers in movie form  This was so good and I totally was blinded by the truth up until the main character  Rachel  was starting to figure it out  I mean at first I had the suspicion but I laughed at myself because I thought I was just being paranoid  But I was actually right to suspect something  It was really hard to guess who it was because you can t really trust any of the characters I really enjoyed the characters and their craziness and rawness of all of them  Like what everyone says  they are indeed all horrible  It s kind of scary that I easily sympathize with Rachel  It was hard for me not to care for her character and it blinded me the way she was blinded from the truth  The other characters are so good as well especially with the three main characters including Rachel  They each have their own different personalities  The way Paula Hawkins can tap into those three alternating different POVs and connect it to one story while still being consistent with each of their personality is very impressive  It s really well done A lot of people compare this to Gone Girl and I can t really attest to that because I only saw the movie  I do understand the comparison a little bit but I think it s only because they fall in the same genre  Judging by the story I saw from the Gone Girl movie  I think I prefer The Girl On The Train more  This book is really scary because it does make you question the things you think you know about people  It makes you question if sometimes do you only see what you want to see in people because some things blind you from seeing someone for who they really are  That s what I loved the most about The Girl On The Train and why I would recommend it to fans of psychological thrillers  The Girl on the Train is on a ton of reading list for 2015 and it is a great read  If you like mysteries then this is a good one to read  The Girl on the Train has been described as the British Gone Girl  I d have to say that while Hawkins writes a compelling story its not quite as twisted  What the author does well is balance the story between 3 main female characters Rachel is an alcoholic who spends a lot of her time on the train enjoy the pastime of people watching  But one day Rachel sees something that allows her to weave herself into the lives of strangers  Anna is the new wife to Rachel s ex husband and a new mother trying to balance home life and the intrusive ex wife  Megan is Anna s young neighbor a reminder of Anna s past and a woman with a dark secret of her own  The Girl on the Train is an interesting murder mystery and revolves around the idea that you can never truly be certain of person s secrets and past  whether you trust them or chose to be a spectator on their lives   A classic thriller that had me hooked from the first chapter  It leaves you wanting to know more page after page  Highly recommend  Epitelous breka khrono

the train back and forth between London and the suburb where she lives  She reveals herself to us with each trip  We see her creating stories in her mind about a couple she sees each day near one of the stops on the way to London and again as she travels home  We become as keen to see what this couple is up to as Rachel is We see that Rachel is drinking  Although at first it seems casual we soon understand that it is somewhat serious  Eventually we realize that Rachel is an alcoholic Three women tell this story which begins with a tiny grave by some railroad tracks  a woman in some kind of extremely frightening situation  and a small pile of dirty clothing by the side of the rails that Rachel rides each day  Talk about foreshadowing  As we switch back and forth between glimpses of their lives at first we only see what Rachel sees  Rachel has very good reasons to stalk this particular set of town houses that back up to the train tracks  She once lived happily in one of those houses with her husband Tom Just as a train picks up pace each time it leaves a station  this story is fleshed out each time we travel with Rachel past those Blenheim Road town houses  Rachel begins as a stalker but eventually she doesn t keep her distance from these two couples  Anne and her ex  Tom and the  perfect  couple  Jess and Jason  actually Megan and Scott   When Megan goes missing on the exact Saturday that Rachel arrives back from a Blenheim Road  stalking  expedition with bleeding injuries and no memory of what she did that night  Rachel s need to fill in those missing hours reveals truths about all three women and also about the men these women love  As a consequence of Rachel s bumbling attempts to get answers  we  the readers  get to go along for a mind boggling  goose flesh raising  and tangled ride The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is engrossing and leads you on a very modern trip on a rather old style train  When I am not thinking that Rachel may have done something unpardonable  I am thinking how much this book is like Alfred Hitchcock s Rear Window with legs   Yes  the Jimmy Stewart movie  Your trust in humanity may suffer a bit as this one unravels  This novel gets full marks because  while perhaps not deeply literary  it is well written and obviously has great mass market appeal  It is difficult to put it down  The Girl On The Train was a very good mystery novel  A bit repetitive  but it was fast paced and I  for one  couldn t put the book down  The mystery was great and had just enough gaps for me to make up my own crazy theories  including one involving me suspecting that Rachel was a twin or Rachel and Megan were the same person  I didn t have a problem with any of the characters  like a lot of people and I felt that the points of view were easy to tell apart  This definitely would have been a five star read if the ending was executed a bit better  It wasn t the reveal of the murderer  because I didn t personally see that one coming  but the book spends 280 pages creating an amazing mystery and it ends in a quick 30 pages or so  I also wish there was more of a  twist  like the reviews on the book suggest  I was surprised  but the reveal felt dull and fell flat for me  I ll definitely be reading this again soon  this time keeping a close eye on the person behind the mystery  Much like Gone Girl  The story was indeed a thriller and definitely kept me up reading  However  the main character being an alcoholic was a less enticing part of the book  The constant reference to her drinking was tedious and had no added value to the suspense of the story  Having said that  the storyline as a whole was interesting and would lend itself well to become a film one day  Overall I enjoyed reading The Girl on The Train  but the hype surrounding this book may slightly disappoint some readers when coming round to reading it   I agree that there is only one  voice   which is a shame  but it s still a page turner   I m giving this a four because I was intrigued the entire time I was reading this book  I read it in a day  Sometimes I was reading because I was invested  other times I was reading and thinking  oh good lord just let me get to the end so I can find out what happened  I was a little disappointed  but only because this was hyped up as  the next Gone Girl   and I loved Gone Girl so much that anything less than the same level of insanity would have disappointed me  So no  this is not Gone Girl  I would have liked it a lot more if that comparison hadn t been made so many times before I read this book  I liked the writing  I liked the shifting perspectives  and the changes in time weren t too jarring  I was expecting a slightly more twisted and convoluted ending  you find out what happens and then that s kind of it  But I didn t hate it  The entire time  I was trying to make guesses  and I slipped into Pretty Little Liars mode and assumed everyone had a twin or wasn t dead and then I was like wait  maybe EVERYONE is dead  I made up so many crazy stories that the actual story was less intense than everything I made up   This came really close to getting five stars from me  but I think the ending hits the cliches a bit too hard  and I wish the male characters had some of the emotional depth that the women show Clever  suspenseful  well written  and definitely recommended  Way ahead of most bestselling thriller fare  A compelling and intriguing psychological thriller about human weakness and obsession This is Paula Hawkins first book and has already been signed up for a movie The book centres around Rachel  an unemployed  recently divorced alcoholic who becomes involved in a criminal investigation as a result of what she witnesses on her daily commute into London  It s this storyline that intrigued me as I for one gaze out of trains and wonder at the lives that are glimpsed as we flash past The story is told from the various viewpoints of the main characters and ratchets up the tension as you discover that almost all of them have something to hide  Once I got the hang of the names the book is a relatively easy read and doesn t get unnecessarily graphic in its descriptions If you like your British crime like Broadchurch or Lewis then this is for you  The girl on the train is filled with despicable characters  I had a really hard time getting into the story because of this  But then the mystery starts to unravel  like a slow train gaining speed  and it was a deeply unsettling experience  Towards the end and I my heart was racing and I could not put the book down  Very satisfying  P S  I can t believe goodreads hasn t recommended this book to me before now  Odd   Crazy  psycho  who done it  thriller book  Well written  I could not stop reading it once I started  Una vez mas las expectativas magnifican lo que esperas de la historia  sin embargo desde la pagina 1 quedas enganchado por el relato de la protagonista  empatizando con ella hasta el final  Gran libro  que brilla mas por Rachel y sus problemas que por su final The Girl on the TrainFirst  let me say that I love a good who done it  I also enjoy books in which the narrative point of view shifts from character to character because I enjoy learning how one character s memory or impression of events varies from another character    even when they may be in the same room at the same time  And I enjoy flawed but sympathetic characters  because as we all know  in real life no one is all good or all bad This book has all of the above  and is what I call a real page turner  There s a difference  of course  between great or even good writing and good story telling  This book is an example of good story telling  If I had had the time I could have and would have read this book from cover to cover in one sitting  Is it great writing  No  But it is a compelling story with lots of suspense  and more than a few surprising twists and turns  A nice debut for Ms  Hawkins  It will be interesting to see if her next effort is as enjoyable  Really enjoyed this  Read it in a day  couldn t put it down  Only down side was that I guessed the ending really early on in the story  which meant it didn t build up to a shock or have a big impact at the end  But maybe that was my fault for trying to figure it out   Normally  if I enjoy a book but the writing itself doesn t necessarily impress me  I ll give it three stars as a rating   a solid number  Although this book fits this description  I had to give it four stars  I was hooked immediately  finishing it in a matter of days  and I can t say that for many books  I didn t even care for the ending  yet Hawkins s ability to create suspense won me over  Great read  Truth  I didn t know who was the bad person until pretty close to the end  So success in my book  Couldn t put it down   Circumstance and poor choices These characters and their tragic story reminded me so much of the characters in Casual Vacancy  They are victims of circumstance and in the end their pathetic lives and all their lies  to each other and to themselves  catch up with them  With no real ending for Rachel  I feel she suffered the most  This story kept me on the edge  but I couldn t quite piece things together until the very end  much like Rachel  Overall  it was good but I was left feeling disillusioned like all the characters in this book   Love a good thriller and this one kept me guessing  The dates were a little confusing at times but overall good  Loved it  The structure  chapters hopping back and forth in time  centered on different characters  made it a little hard to follow at first  I found myself flipping back to check on details frequently  It was all worth it  however   I really enjoyed this book  It was different   which is why I m pretty surprised at the comparisons to Gone Girl  While both are psychological thrillers  Gone Girl disturbed me while The Girl on the Train made me think  It made me think about people we bump into everyday and relationships  I was a bit concerned that the mystery would be easily solved with such a small cast of characters  But the author did a great job developing these few characters into such complex beings that I truly was unable to figure it out until the end  She did a great job of blurring the line between right and wrong  good and evil  She makes you root for people you do want to like and question those you would be drawn to  I appreciate that at various points during the book I thought everyone was  innocent  and everyone was  guilty  My only complaint with the book is that it ended a bit abruptly  After so many twists and turns I would have appreciated a cleaner finish  It s like she hit 300 pages and tried to wrap it up as quickly as possible  With such a small cast of characters I grew attached to each and every one of them and would have liked to followed each of them through the conclusion I definite recommend this book  If you re deciding between Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train I can say that Gone Girl really gave me the creeps whereas The Girl on the Train was more of a traditional who done it mystery to solve  The Girl on the Train keeps getting compared to Gone Girl and I m not sure why  In this book  a wife disappears and her husband is blamed  but that s the only similarity  Well  there s also a  twist   but don t a lot of books have that  I listened to Girl on the Train with my husband on audiobook  The interesting thing about it is that the characters aren t really likeable  I liked Anna and I m not sure I was supposed to  She had an affair with the main character s husband  Somehow I could forgive her that  I think I liked her because she was just honest about things and she wasn t a pushover  The main character  Rachel  is pretty pathetic  It was an interesting choice  definitely different  She is still hung up about the break up of her marriage  she is friendless  and she was recently fired  but is lying about it to her one friend and landlord  When she becomes slightly involved in the case  she becomes obsessed because there is nothing else going on in her world  She lies and lies to stay part of the action and pretends she knows more than she does  This story was really slow moving  Things were revealed very slowly and I m not sure if I would have continued reading it were it not in audio format  Or maybe it would ve been easier to read because I read faster than I listen  I liked the twist  but I guessed it beforehand  so it wasn t surprising to me at all  It didn t get too exciting until the end  but when it finally did  I enjoyed it  I enjoyed Gone Girl a lot more than this if you re trying to choose between the stories  This book is slow at times  but if you can hold on  I do think the ending is worth it   Interesting story Having never read nor watched Gone Girl  but knowing the general gist of that story I can see the similarities  The characters were interesting and compelling  My issues with the book were with Tom  Anna and Rachel  It grated on me how pompous Tom and Anna were behaving in relation to Rachel considering that their relationship began as an extra marital affair  They just had some nerve sitting on their high horse but considering the nature of the story  that was intentional  I see that  but it still bugs me  Perhaps I would have enjoyed the story more if that situation was not so    I want to say unrealistic  but unfortunately I know it s very real  Good story  I enjoyed it  It started a bit slow for me but when it got going it was hard to put down  I see the movie is expected next year and for the most part the casting is decent but I would prefer someone besides Chris Evans as Tom  I can t buy that  I think Jude law would be a very convincing Tom  just throwing that out into the universe  Good story   The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  like Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn  is a cast of unlikable characters caught up in a story that keeps you reading because you want to know what happens  A woman prone to blackouts  a woman who disappears  a marriage based on adultery  and lots of secrets create the mystery of this book  I did guess the correct guilty party  but it was a whole lot of fun to see how the book got there Read my complete review at  http   www memoriesfrombooks com 2015    The Girl on the Train by Paula HawkinsThe book is told from the perspective of three deliciously flawed characters  Each chapter is written by one of these main characters so paying attention to the date and narrator of each chapter is imperative The  girl on the train  is Rachel  Rachel is a mess  She is unemployed but continues to commute back and forth to a job she no longer holds and is a hopeless alcoholic with a history of blackouts  She has a hard time distinguishing fact from fiction  She becomes obsessed with a couple she sees from the train whom she names Jess and Jason  actually Megan and Scott  and yearns for their seemingly idyllic life  Megan also happens to be the neighbor of Tom  Anna and their baby Evie  Tom being Rachel s ex husband whom she still mourns  Anna appears to be the perfect second wife  So many twists and turns in this book that it is easy to devour in an afternoon  Despite not liking any of the characters  I enjoyed the book  It was strange feeling little emotional tie to any of the characters and not being too concerned if anything bad happened to them  but I feel that shows the book was good as I still couldn t put it down wanting to see what would happen in the story  Well  that was entertaining  I can see what all the hype is about  There was a lot I liked but a few things I didn t  which kept me from giving it 5 stars  What I didn t like  First there were no likeable characters in this book  none  The female characters were flawed  weak  even submissive  I don t want to forget they were living in fear  being abused  both mentally and physically  but still  The men were just awful  One was a psychopath  the other a jealous  abusive brute  Even the secondary characters fell short of being decent  The foreshadowing with Megan was confusing because it wasn t in the same time frame  What I did like  This was a debut novel  that s impressive  I liked the pace of the novel  it truly is a page turner  I liked the quick changing point of views  that s the way I like to read  The writing was obviously good I would llike to say one thing about alcoholism  which is a prevalent theme in this book  I have witnessed it s effect first hand in my sphere of family and friends  Rachel was struggling with this along with the other negative issues in her life  In the end she was able to find the strength to overcome  to find the will to do the right thing  I was proud of her at the end  A thriller that didn t  as I feared  have a predictable ending The characters were all touched with corruption and weakness  against the backdrop of a longing for idyllic love Especially well drawn is the portrait of the main character s depression and alcoholism This book is suspenseful and keeps you turning pages  and will leave you uneasy after you close it It reminded me  for various reasons  of  Rear Window     Crime and Punishment   and  Twelve Angry Men   a somber  rain soaked journey into darkness  If you haven t yet read this book  keep in mind when you do that the first 100 pages are so painful it s hard to continue reading  It begins from the perspective of an extremely unlikable character  is depressing  and told entirely in the thoughts of the characters  no dialog   But curiosity got the best of me  how can this book have so many 5 star ratings   so I kept reading  Soon the plot draws you in  and then you re hooked  The author keeps you wondering who could  have done it   until a few chapters from the end  making it unfortunately somewhat anticlimactic  Definitely not the book for everyone  this is a solid psychological thriller  Perfect vacation book  couldn t put it down and couldn t wait to pick I up   3 1 2 stars For the first two thirds of this book the three main characters  who are all female  drove me NUTS  Whinging  whining  irritating losers and liars   all three  Rachel  who is the focus voice  is an unemployed alcoholic  an ex wife  and the most unreliable of unreliable narrators  Megan is also a liar  but is up front with us about what she has lied about  And Anna is a psychotic  paranoid liar  Not three of the most attractive protagonists I ve ever read  But each of them evokes sympathy and empathy for the situations they have willingly put themselves in  I think that thing I found most frustrating about them all was their passivity   how prepared they were to be walked all over by other people  how trusting  Even in the last moments of the book  when I was shouting at the car stereo to tell them what they should do  their lack of decision making skills was beyond belief That said  it is a gripping read in the end  I guessed the ending about two thirds of the way through  so the rest of the book I was just waiting to see if I was right  but the tension builds and builds and builds  until you finding yourself screaming at the top of your lungs for them to run the hell away  Somewhat obvious  but entertaining  Gripping  couldn t put it down   I thoroughly enjoyed this book  So so good  Twists and turns and just a damn good read  go on read it     no geral foi uma leitura bem prazeirosa e que me fez ate surpresa em alguns momentos  a protagonista tem seus defeitos  e MUITOS  mas nao o suficiente que a impeca de evoluir  voces com certeza vao me ouvir falando mais sobre ele  I loved this book  and precisely for the reason some people hate it  Yes the characters are unlikeable and make you feel uncomfortable  but what a breath of fresh air it was  It makes a change from vigorously skim reading through all the over descriptive  boring writing in the style that I ve come across time and time again  Hawkins gets straight to the point and carries your attention throughout  without the novel ever getting boring  I loved the gritty and  depressing  tone of the novel  as it made it that more realistic  The main character was an alcoholic  so she s not exactly going to be singing about rainbows and butterflies is she  You could literally feel how anxious and depressed she was as a result of drinking every day which I thought was brilliantly written  Although I d guessed who the culprit was near the end  my opinion is that it isn t exactly the story that makes this novel stand out  it s the way it is written  Although I loved gone girl and never thought I d find anything better  I found myself preferring this one as it was more realistic and relatable  which I personally found more interesting  Paula Hawkins writes engagingly  creates characters whom one might meet in real life    though I wouldn t want to meet some of them  Early on  I was struck by the moral relativism of the main characters  It bothered me a lot  I didn t like them  wasn t sure I wanted to finish the book  But then  the story took hold  No  I didn t agree with most of the choices several of the characters made  but I felt compelled to keep reading  to find out what happened to them  For those who like satisfying endings  I think you won t be disappointed  kept me turning pages as quickly as possible to figure out  who done it    My review in swedish      Romeoandjuliet Not sure I liked any of the characters but I still wanted to get to the end  It was like Rear Window by not sure who is crazy and who telling the truth  Great thriller  Now I know what all the hub bub is about  Couldn t put it down  The thing about unlikable characters is that we re ALL unlikable characters to some degree  and that s why we don t like them    we can see pieces of ourselves in obsessive  desperate  alcoholic Rachel  and I won t really talk about the others because   SPOILZ  That being said  this book is continually compared to  Gone Girl   I can see the comparison only to the point that both are suspense novels that are also character studies on several main characters  In this case  it s women   The cover art    normally  I don t think much of it  because it s either too simple or cliched  but to be honest I thought it was very cleverly done  The image is obviously of a scene rushing by as one sits on a train  But could it not also represent the blur of a rush of a drunken night  One where you might not remember very well  and perhaps that one drunken night happened to be a Saturday  where everything is a blur and you really  really ought to remember  Finally  the double lettering reminds me of the jostling of train cars on the tracks  But it also can stand for duplicity  We have a slew of unreliable narrators   cheaters  liars  alcoholics    all trying to convince themselves that it s OK to do these things  that they re really trying  that they deserve happiness  that it s okay to destroy other people s things for the sake of their own  I loved Rachel s quote    something about how following your heart always leads to disaster  and doing it is only ever foolish  I liked the writing a great deal and I enjoyed the character studies  but it was the plot for me that felt a little     meh  I was looking for the great writing to create a little more plot  I was looking for  Rear Window  suspense  In other words  I was looking for more Rachel on the Train seeing things  and less Rachel gets on the train in the first quarter of the book and then sees something immediately  leading to the last 3 4 being more filler and Rachel trying to convince people she saw something  I wish that  Jess and Jason  were more developed as IDEAS that Rachel had  because that would have made the Megan parts more shocking Again  more staring out the window on the train  less other fluff  Even if Rachel continued narrating six months  worth of taking the train in the morning   taking the train of the evening just to note her thoughts on Jess and Jason and what they re doing  I think that would have left a greater impact when she finally sees what she sees    and to be honest  what she sees is also very     meh  Nothing I would define as shocking  particularly if she doesn t know them  If I had seen it  I would have been like   Well  wow  so that s   your life  good luck  but I don t know anything about you  so I guess I ll just forget about it   I did very much enjoy the idea of alcoholic blackouts  It made for an interesting protagonist and I liked the center of the whole story  the key to the puzzle  being locked away in a blackout  What happened Saturday night  Who knows  And the guilt that results from that is very genuine  The ending was a copout though  Just saying  Everything fit the narrative   but oh geez  seriously  Ugh  I wish there was more to it   TL DR  More girl on the train  and less of everyone else   This book has been touted as the Gone Girl of 2015  and many people are adding the caveat   But not as good    and I will agree that it s a page turner  I didn t think it was from page one  however  it took some getting into  In fact  when I was on page 30 I ended up picking up another book and starting it instead  but later that day I thought no  I should get back to this one  And then it began moving  and once it does    pardon the pun    it really does move along at the pace of a freight train  The main character  Rachel  is the girl on the train  thinking she s seen something from the window and then becoming involved in other people s lives when a woman disappears from her old neighbourhood  The problem is  Rachel is a raging alcoholic  and so she s an unreliable narrator  The black holes in her memory contain the most important puzzle pieces  and throughout the book she struggles to find them  I really enjoyed it  and no  it doesn t have the same number of twists as Gone Girl  and some of the characters are a little black and white and it doesn t have the complexity  but it might have a slightly more satisfying ending than that book did  It s definitely a fun  light  and suspenseful read   Ho cominciato a leggere questo libro su consiglio della mia amica Lisa ed inizialmente non sapevo che aspettarmi  Rachel  la protagonista  non sembra altro che un ubriacona annoiata che passa le sue giornate a bordo di un treno  che la porta a Londra  e che ama sbirciare che succede nelle case degli altri  Ogni mattina  infatti  Rachel non perde occasione di guardare cosa fanno gli abitanti nel quartiere dove fino a poco tempo fa aveva abitato con il suo ex marito  Proprio nello svelare la sua vita passata la protagonista abbandona il ruolo di  donna frustrata e noiosa  per divenire  donna amareggiata dalla vita  che cerca il sostegno dei lettori  Si scopre che per Rachel i problemi con l alcool sono cominciati in seguito all abbandono del marito e al desiderio mai avveratosi di diventare madre  Nella sua vita grigia e piena di difficolta  con la sola compagnia di un amica che la ospita presso la propria casa  Rachel diventa all improvviso parte di un complicato intreccio che comprende la sparizione di una donna e delle strane visioni offuscate dagli eccessivi bicchieri di vino  Da questo momento il romanzo abbandona lo stile rosa per diventare un thriller  soft  che coinvolge il lettore fino alle ultime pagine  Consigli  astenersi amanti del genere poliziesco  avanti tutta lettori che credono nel riscatto di una protagonista un po  antipatica e maldestra  Great vacation read  Superb Page Turner of Voyeurism  Heartache and AlcoholismHave you ever sat near the window on a train and observed people in their apartments  offices  or homes  Children playing outside the same time every day  Husbands leaving for work  A secretary staring at a computer screen  A woman looking happy and serene or quite disturbed  Paula Hawkins grabs the reader as the main character  Rachel  rides the 8 02 AM to London every business morning and conjures up stories about the people she sees from the train  Rachel returns from London a 5 00 train  but in between she is roaming around London pretending to her landlord  Cathy  that she has a job Rachel is an alcoholic  spending her time and money sloshing from scene to scene  Her drunken escapades produce blackouts making her voyeurism on the train remarkable  Rachel has no self esteem since she has lost her husband  Tom  to another woman  She is more than forlorn  she barely functions  I felt like the author was moving me from one drunken stupor to another Rachel observes an idyllic couple from the train and then sees their lives change  She is so desperate to be worthy to someone  she pretends she may know more than she does about the woman  Megan  the beautiful woman of this destructive couple  Hawkins uses Rachel s alcoholism as a barrier to reality undercutting any self confidence for her  The women in the plot are part cloying  depressed and hold secrets As the mystery reaches a climax  I expected a real surprise ending  but it isn t there  This book does not compare to Gone Girl  However  it did hold my attention and the machinations and evolvement of Rachel s emotions are worth the read  I noticed that people were comparing this book to  Gone Girl  which is actually one of my favorites  I couldn t understand why they were comparing the two but now as I look back I can see similarities  the way the story is told  bouncing between different perspectives  the fact that the wife goes missing  the unlikable characters  If those aspects are unappealing to you  go ahead and give this book a pass  Otherwise  I recommend this story  It will take you for a ride of mystery and the slow revealing of each character s true self   Great great great  It s so addictive  Can t wait to read another book from Paula Hawkins   Reminded me so much of Gone Girl   just as suspenseful  just as much of a page turner  I can see why this one was so popular as well and will undergo the same fate of a movie in the works  I did predict what would happen about 3 4 of the way through  but this did not stop me from steamrolling through to read the exact details  A friend asked if I felt this book was reflective of empowered women  or the opposite  I think it depends on what point of the story you are at  The character of Rachel was extremely irritating to me for most of the book   and the other characters weren t much better  I did find this comment interesting since I had finished Big Little Lies not too long ago and that theme concept was prevalent in both   The girl on the train is Rachel  an unemployed alcoholic still bitter from her divorce from Tom  She travels each day to and from London and soon begins to fantasize about the people she notices as she stares out the window  Then there s a murder     but there will be no spoiler here  I can say this was an excellent psychological thriller that kept my interest throughout  Good pacing  well written  suspenseful  The chapters shifted between three narrators each dropping subtle hints regarding  the mystery   Despite the fact that most of the characters were pretty unlikeable  I really liked this book  Kept me guessing until the end  Good story with a decent treatment to keep you reading further  Mystery aspect was a bit weak as I figured out the killer too soon  Still the human aspect and the protagonist s story was well done  Over all I like the novel  It was different and intriguing  Really dark but I have to say I liked it  Read it in one sitting  Something about the narrator   I found her relatable and was rooting for her despite her lunacy   slow claps it out   Good read but the ending fell a little flat for me  A solid debut by Paula Hawkins  And very surprising too  I glanced at the synopsis a while back before I got a chance to read the book but it was nothing from what I remembered  At first I was a little bummed out but that feeling lasted maybe a chapter in before I was fully engrossed in the book  The  shocking scene  that Rachel saw mentioned in the synopsis takes a while to be revealed and honestly  I had forgotten about it  so invested was I in the lives of Rachel and the other characters  Beginning of the book  I couldn t help myself be disgusted by Rachel  IRL you would avoid associating yourself with a person like her  It s a shame because  as you read  you can tell there s a smart and focused personality underneath all that alcohol and depression  I also felt sad for her because although she says that it was solely her fault for breaking her marriage and considering what I know now about her and Tom  I know that isn t true  Later on  as you read through her struggle against alcoholism  your impression of her changes and you can t help yourself but cheer for her  When she gets a hand on her alcohol intake  you re happy for her yet are waiting with bated breath to see how long before she starts drinking herself into a stupor again  And when she does  you re disappointed yet not surprised  And then comes the shame  the regretful actions  the vows to stop cold turkey that lasts for a few days until it doesn t and on and on the cycle goes  Underneath all that though  she has a wounded fragile heart that would cause her to cry when a stranger would be kind to her  or on the loss of an unborn child of a person she s never met before Those were the most heart breaking moments for me  the realization of her lack of companionship  her absolute loneliness  and her imagined worthlessness  And when you re confused with emotions and dead ends all over the place  it comes together  All the hints scattered across the book  jumbled up to make the reader have second and then third thoughts  they get together to have this epic moment of clarity with the tension cranked up high  all thunder and lightening and rain  And you re sitting there at the edge of your seat  hoping and praying that it doesn t go to waste Overall  the author does a marvellous job going deep into the psyche of all the characters presented in the book to make the readers realize that nothing is what it seems upon first glance  They re all ugly characters but she plays superbly well as a devil s advocate for all of them which causes the readers to continuously shift their opinion and impression of them so that you are unable to make a judgement until she explains everything from every perspective  not a single thing missed  right onto the final page of this incredibly story  Very well done  compelling psycho thriller  I think I figured it out well before the ending  but I was not  sure  and was thus hooked until the last page   I bought this book because it was recommended to me due to my love of  Gone Girl   1  It was entertaining  The 4 stars make that clear  I would consider it  more or less  a  page turner  once I got used to the 3 different perspectives in the book 2  It was not as good as  Gone Girl   In fact  due to the storyline and the multiple POVs  it seemed like a  lesser  version of a better book  Made me wonder if Ms  Hawkins wasn t inspired by Flynn s writing 3  I dislike information reveals in unbelievable conversations  This book had that element  It felt a bit fake and cheap to me  The author had done such a good job of revealing information through different perspectives  that I disliked the conversation approach  those who have read it will know what I m talking about  I rate a book based on a number of things  After stumbling through the beginning  I grew more interested in the story and where it was leading  I began to get the 3 characters straight in my head  which made it much  much easier to read by about the 1 3 point  I will admit that the later 1 3 of the book I would consider  un put downable   which vaulted this into it s 4 star rating Enjoyable read  Not as good as  Gone Girl   Would pick up another book by this author to see if I like her other work  This book really had me gripped from the moment I started reading it  I felt  however  that the characters were a bit off  The plot was brilliant and I really liked the female presence  unlike that in Gone Girl   A great thriller and I think I m beginning to become a fan of this genre    my problems with books like that is always that i know who the killer is  or at least i have a wry strong guess  and then i m kind of disappointed when i m right  the same was with this book  i had this suspicion who the murderer was and was proven right  how boring   Otherwise the book was really addicting and the characters very interesting  The whole story and writing style reminded me really of Gone Girl and the book is definitely worth a read  Reazione a caldissimo  FINALE SODDISFACENTE  OH YEAH Per me ormai i finali dei thriller psicologici sono una parte fondamentale della struttura del romanzo  devono essere coerenti con il resto della storia  e ultimamente  si Gillian Flynn  parlo di te  Vedi Gone Girl e Dark Places  rimanevo delusa dalla conclusione di romanzi che fino a quel momento erano quasi perfetti Per La ragazza del treno invece  FINALMENTE la conclusione e stata degna della storia  Il romanzo in se e ben scritto  ben riuscito e i personaggi sono folli al punto giusto per questo genere letterario  Certo  avrei voluto fosse piu lungo per cogliere piu sfumature dei protagonisti ma in generale l esperienza di lettura si e rivelata piu che positiva Sono diventata io troppo brava a capire il colpevole oppure era abbastanza evidente   P Ai posteri l ardua sentenza ps  voglio sapere TUTTO dell adattamento cinematografico in atto  I enjoyed the book   it took me two days to finish  Each chapter alternately follows the story of three women  None of the women are very likable  but  that s what makes it a good read  I like when an author can make you dislike a character  And  being I m no detective  I only began to piece things together when the author wanted me too  Definitely a good read for book clubs  Vey good debut  The story told from the point of view of three characters  Could have distinguished the writing style of each  But the whodunit is holding up till the very end and that makes it a worthwhile read   Rachel loves to ride the train each day and watching her favorite couple  Jason   Jess  as she passes by her old neighborhood  They seem like the perfect couple until she sees something suspicious from the train one day  She couldn t ignore the sight  and suddenly her life gets intertwined with theirs  Told in multiple perspectives with important details missing to keep you guessing until the conclusion of the novel  I enjoyed this read  but I still prefer reading YA  I thought it was going to be along the lines of Gone Girl which I did not like  But this book was much better in that it was faster paced  I could have easily read this in one sitting   A quick and enjoyable read with a good plot twist near the end of the story  Would recommend to those interested in books about pretty messed up people and to those who enjoy glimpses into the lives of others  One of my favorite movies is  Rear Window  and trying to figure out if the characters really saw what they thought they did   The Girl on the Train  follows suit as you try to determine who really saw what  Like a Nancy Drew mystery  Had it figured out before she thought it was Scott  just not the how s  So first things first  If you liked Gone Girl  you would love The Girl On The Train  Paula Hawkins seems to be the long lost sister of Gillian Flynch  arriving from the shadows and exploding like a star on the literary screen  You WILL have a great sense of deja vu permeating your senses as you go through the description of the characters  situations  plots This is Gone Girl part deux  make no mistake  For someone who debuted as a writer for a novel  Paula Hawkins  her of Zimbabwean origins  writes very very tightly  Her plot leaves no scope for doubts  no scope for letting the reader imagine that the situation could have been handled better  no loose ends anywhere You will be on the edge of the seat till about 85  of the novel after which the climax kind of gives away  What I was upset about is that the climax presents itself perchance  not a tightly wound spring waiting to be unwound with a bang  It just appears out of nowhere which is slightly debilitating to my intelligence That said  the novel is a surefire winner and a book which you should read to stay update on what s happening on the mystery writing scene in London and otherwise  Unexpected ending and couldn t see what s coming until the end Wow  I m honestly not even sure where to start    Rachel  the girl on the train  is an alcoholic ex wife who has trouble remembering while also having trouble letting go  harboring guilt  shame  and an all incompassing obsession    Megan  the girl on the terrace  is harboring more secrets than even she knows    And Anna  the  other  girl  is harboring anger towards them both  even if she s not entirely sure why at first    They have more in common than they know  and Paula Hawkins weaves their stories together with a fast paced thriller that will leave readers feeling waves of empathy and disgust for each if them I very much enjoyed this story  I wouldn t put it in the same writing category as Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl  even if it is the same genre  Both are very interesting  and I felt invested in each plot and its characters  The only thing separating these two is that Hawkins gives readers a bit more information  helping us put the pieces of the puzzle together faster than the main character  and without much of a twist once you ve figured it out  Except Anna s final  twist   pun intended  Those of you who have already read the book will get that poor attempt at a joke    It was definitely a book that grabs you  sucks you in  and takes you on a bit of a crazy wild goose chase before revealing the whodunit  I first heard of the book on Tana French s Facebook page  The Secret Place  TF s latest  was on a list of books to read if you were looking for something similar to The Girl On The Train so I thought I d give it a read  Unlike French s stories  I wasn t very invested in any of the characters  but it was dark and twisty and a good read for sure  My rating is probably more like 3 5  I m definitely in between  liked it  and  really liked it   I really wish GoodReads had half stars  This was really worthy of 3 5 stars  not 4  It was a bit too much Gone Girl for me  but at least I didn t throw this book when I finished it   So I just read this in one sitting and it s currently 4 30am lol  I kind of picked the ending so it loses a star but I couldn t put it down because I had to know who done it which is really how I think every good thriller should be  Entertaining  exciting  enthralling   impressive debut  A page turner with a hot mess of characters  Contemporary fiction isn t really my thing so  The Girl on the Train  wasn t my first choice when it comes to books in general  but it was my book club s selection  and I was pleasantly surprised  and not just because it was set in England    The writing is very good  and the storyline believable with the entire thread of suspense throughout the book  A modern thriller with a bit of Whodunit undertones  it was a slow start  especially because I couldn t really get into any of the characters   but once I got through the first half  I couldn t put it down  If you also have an overactive imagination like I do  you ll definitely never have a normal train ride ever again after reading this one  that s for sure  You can read my full book review here Wow  The Girl on the Train  This was as interesting as Gone Girl and I m really glad I picked it up  An extremely pacy read with a mystery that is not easy to unfold  Amazing debut by Paula Hawkins If you like to read psychological thrillers or mysteries  this is a must for you  This quote from the dust jacket says it best   Compulsively readable  The Girl on the Train is an emotionally immersive  Hitchcockian thriller and an electrifying debut   My only complaint is the structure  which I found somewhat confusing  I had to keep turning back to keep track of the timeframe  which was annoying  Great characters  though  and a plot that keeps you guessing  A very good read  4 5 possibly 5 stars So very compelling and with every page I just wanted to delve deeper into the minds of the characters  Such interesting and layered characters too  Not sure if I liked any of them although they did invoke such a range of emotions  sympathy  disgust  pity  frustration     that I just couldn t stop reading  I don t read thrillers all that often  but when I do I really enjoy them  Part of the  thrill  for me with these type of books  aside from the  you know  nail biting tension and suspense  is trying to outsmart the characters to see if I can work out who the killer is before them  Now  either I ve lost my touch or this book is more clever than a lot in the genre because I was very slow at working out what was happening in this book  I was supremely confident I had it worked it out  but then more and more information came out and the book took twists and turns  and it turned out I was supremely    wrong  Good fun I ve seen this promoted as the next Gone Girl  and there are some similarities  Both have unreliable narrators  despicable characters  although I liked Rachael  and    can t say more   spoilers  But  I don t really think the books are alike at all  it definitely isn t the comparison I would draw  I felt the book was more an amalgam of Into the Darkest Corner and Before I Go To Sleep in both plot  and in developing that same hazy  unsettling vibe both those books had  There were some things I found irritating about the early parts of the novel  The exposition of characters was fairly heavy handed  with chapters and chapters of internal monologue and only a line or two of incidental dialogue  I wouldn t say the early part of the novel was tedious  but it was long winded  So if you start the book and feel a bit uncertain about it  I suggest to keep going with it because it does improve and quickly becomes a very gripping read  I wouldn t say this was the greatest thriller I ve ever read  but it was a very good read  and a very promising start from a debut author  Okay  first I want to talk about the misleading blurb on the book  It compares the story to a Hitchcock movie  presumably Rear Window  one of my absolute faves  and hints that the narrator will have to try to prove that the crime or bad thing she witnesses was real  Blurb also throws around a Gone Girl reference  which all recent thrillers seems to want to be compared to lately  This premise is pretty much my sole reason for picking up the book  I mean  you had me at Alfred Hitchcock  Gone Girl comparison  too  Even better  Well  I discovered right away that this is not the actual story  But that s okay  What I found instead is an unreliable narrator and I love  love  love an unreliable narrator   The reader finds out very quickly that the narrator is a drunk prone to blackouts  She can barely function while drinking and she does that a lot  Also  she is not the only narrator  so that added another level of intrigue to this tale  Also  the timeline jumps back and forth  All good stuff  leading up to a satisfying conclusion that even has a surprise plot twist  I enjoyed this thriller  I do  however  take issue with the completely misleading blurb  I mean  did the person even read the book  Lol Anyway  solid four stars for Paula Hawkins  debut novel    I will definitely check out any future books she writes   4 5 estrelasNao sabia bem o que esperar deste thriller mas sabia que ia encontrar personagens bem peculiares  As primeiras 75 paginas do livro aborreceram me e estava pronta para desistir  porque a protagonista   Rachel   estava a dar me cabo dos nervos  Fiquei surpreendida ao perceber que havia tres linhas narrativas das tres personagens femininas   estava pronta para que o livro fosse todo do ponto de vista da Rache   mas gostei desta opcao da autora  Gosto sempre de ter uma visao multipla do que esta a acontecer  da nos a sensacao que conhecemos muito melhor as personagens do que so termos um ponto de vista  A narrativa em trio tambem ajudou a complicar e a desvendar todo o misterio apresentado no livro  Ao principio temos o cerebro com nos  de tanta coisa que nao faz sentido mas quando mais lemos  mais pecinhas se vao juntando  mais o puzzle vai ficando completo  opiniao completa  http   algodaodoceparaocerebro blogsp    Cok sevdim  asiri sevdim fakat eksikleri vardi toplasam bir cuval eder mi bilmiyorum ama 5 vermek gelmedi icimden    Katili her seyi soylememe ragmen tahmin edememisim ve Rachel bence FBI  da calissin   This got a lot of Gone Girl esque sort of hype  I unfortunately haven t read any of Flynn s work  trust me I will   I actually saw and heard of this via a few friends and to my pleasure  Kimberly McCreight  Reconstructing Amelia author  had written praise for the book so I had to read it  This genre of mystery crime thriller that juxtaposes story timelines is pretty huge right now  and I definitely dig it  Structure is so important in books and I think Paula Hawkins does an absolutely incredible job of making a fragmented plot flow and she has that magic touch where she can make different sides of the stories  at different times in the story  mesh  The Girl on the Train follows a few characters  mainly Rachel  as she goes about her very dysfunctional life  It juxtaposes a made up fantasy life of Jess and Jason s ideal life  Of course it is all made up in her head  Jess is actually a cheating  wild  free spirited Megan  and Jason is the controlling  jealous husband Scott  Scott sounds a lot worse than he is but in all honesty  not one character has true redeeming qualities  Not one  I hate every single one of them  Four houses or so down from  Jess and Jason  is Rachel s old house she shared with her now ex husband and he just so happens to be living there with his mistress and daughter  As the story unfolds you get Rachel s drunken and jagged point of view of the perfect life  Jess and Jason  as well as her past life she has eft behind  You also get a glimpse into the past with Megan  and Anna s point of view that s a bit on the outside but she clearly has issues  Anna and Megan are tied together because Megan is sleeping with Tom  Anna s husband  who also happens to be Rachel s ex husband  Rachel is connected to Megan because she invented a story she longingly wished for  as she watched them on the train  When Megan disappears  Rachel and Scott begin to try to place some pretty fragmented pieces together but she realizes Scott s anger and jealous tendencies  Every character is tied together in some sort of super love triangle  There are pretty big twists  I was set off the wrong path at first  but the more you read and get sucked in the more you are attempting to figure out the clues  I did suspect Tom  due to his past  mistress loving past   being the killer but I also thought it may of been Anna  out of jealousy or Rachel  out of jealousy for Scott    I never thought it was Scott  I can say this  Tom is a lying  manipulative tool  Scott is a jealous  angry raging mess  Rachel is a depressed alcoholic  Megan is an attention seeking  cheating  unhappy wife  Anna is a literal jealous psychopath  There is not one character that you like  which is why this is so brilliant  I wanted to be on some of their sides  but as soon as you find out who they truly are  you hate them even more and you begin to understand how unreliable each one of them is    The Girl on the Train warranted a story of intrigue  psychological mysteries and quite a lot of character development  Paula Hawkins allows the reader to know the characters and understand their emotions from her artfully developed alternative point of views between Rachel  Megan and Anna  The success of a character s growth  her rise and fall and giving the reader the feel of understanding all of this development without the need to write a book of a thousand or more pages takes cleverness  I can understand and almost feel the depression of Rachel  the paranoia of Anna and the denial of rejection from Megan  Hawkins successfully played the timelines and the points of views from each woman on the same days without being repetitive   as repetition can be the aspect that brings a book down  Each time she alters between a character  a new detail comes to light Another aspect that Paula Hawkins  The Girl on the Train was successful at was its unpredictability  As each clue or thought is slowly fed to me  I thought I had the answer figured out  Yet  the next clue keeps me guessing until the very end  The success of a thriller depends on the suspense and Hawkins kept the suspense at bay throughout the book  The book almost brings a rush of adrenaline to me as I read it  My mind was at a constant rush   searching for my own answers to the missing blanks The intrigue  the near adrenaline rush  the thrill of reading   and yet  the book did not receive 5 stars  The characters were all pathetic   sadly  it is a book that starts out with depression and ends with depression  starts with an obsession and ends with a continuance of the obsession  and revolves around a group of individuals who all had personal issues  I m not searching for a story full of morale and heroics  but a story in which the main character is a depressed drunk throughout  who lacks any sense of common sense is not one that would warrant 5 stars  I highly recommend the audiobook  Men are bad  Really  there is something wrong with every single one of the   Women too  frankly  That s the plot in a nutshell  but really  what made this Memento esque mystery so good was that all he characters are realistically flawed  but some not as much as you think in the beginning  some more so  and the twist at the end is who falls into which of those categories  This is also a slightly more pleasant read  as the constant swearing that highlighted the tactless evil of the two protagonists in Gone Girl is lacking here  The characters in this book have a vocabulary  thank God  and each a different one in that  Subtle  engrossing  and thoroughly deserving of its popularity  I  Regards to the audio  the two main female characters were perfectly cast  and while the last reader was bit more clipped and classy than her fictional counterpart  it all balanced out to one of the better audio books of the year  I read this book in two days  I couldn t put it down  Paula Hawkins hooked me from the first chapter and from there  the suspense built  I did guess who dunnit in the end and there were flaws in the plot which was annoying and not believable  Overall I did enjoy it  and look forward to reading more from this author  Everybody Lies It s that kind of story  where you must be cautious of what the narrator has to tell  since he or she has a lot of secrets to hide  and tries to spin the tale in way that will gain your sympathy before you find out just how rotten he or she really is For example  I am tempted to like Rachel  the girl who goes everyday to London from Suburbia  looking out the window and making up tales about the people she sees from the window  She s a victim  an underdog  she s got imagination  she s sensitive  My mother used to tell me that I had an overactive imagination  Tom said that  too  I can t help it  I catch sight of these discarded scraps  a dirty T shirt or a lonesome shoe  and all I can think of is the other show and the feet that fitted into them  Her favourite fable is about a youngish couple living next to the railway  She witnesses every day their moving around their house and their tiny courtyard  and wishes she had their life  Until one day Rachel sees something she cannot put into a rosy light  Her model couple is revealed to be a fake  first she witnesses the woman kissing a stranger in full view of the strangers from the train  then she finds out from the papers that the woman has gone missing  Rachel is convinced she knows who did it  and starts to investigate the case on her own As a private investigator Rachel is a veritable trainwreck   she s an alcoholic who lies to her friends  view spoiler   she s been fired for drinking on the ob months ago   hide spoiler     she has total blackouts after she gets drunk  she s too emotional and unstable to think rationally  view spoiler   she s stalking Tom  her former husband and a neighbor of the missing woman  pretending to herself that he still loves her  despite him being remarried and a father to a little girl   hide spoiler    Drunk Rachel sees no consequences  she is either excessively expansive and optimistic or wrapped up in hate  She has no past  no future  She exists purely in the moment  Drunk Rachel   wanting to be part of the story  needing a way to persuade Scott to talk to her   she lied  I lied  Rachel is not the only liar in the novel  Her journal entries alternate with two other  dear diary  accounts  following slightly different timelines and used both to unmask Rachel s fibs and to gradually reveal the secret of Megan s disappearance  One journal is written by the missing Megan  going back one year before her vanishing act  Megan is holding back on the reader about the reasons for her pathological depression  about her betrayals and her slightly psycho personality  She uses love and sex as a means to control the men  her doting husband Scott  her therapist Dr  Kamal   view spoiler   her secret third lover that got her pregnant   hide spoiler     The reader is almost in a tug of war between sympathy for her plight as a do nothing housewife and repulsion at her deviousness  I need to find something that I must do  something undeniable  I can t do this  I can t be just a wife  I don t understand how anyone does it   there is literally nothing to do but wait  Wait for a man to come home and love you  Either that or look around for something to distract you  versus  I was thinking about it on the way home  and that s the thing I like most about it  having power over someone  That s the intoxicating thing  The third narrator is Tom s new wife Anna  the link between Rachel and Megan  She marries Rachel s husband  Megan babysits for her some months before she disappears   Like the other two women protagonists  Anna is not an easy person to like  She s paranoid about her child safety  view spoiler   with some reason  since Rachel tried once to kidnap the kid   hide spoiler     she s extremely jealous of Tom  whose job often makes him work late  she s vindictive and unreasonable whenever she notices Tom s ex stalking around the neighborhood  There s nothing so painful  so corrosive  as suspicion     Enough with the synopsis  I think  Superficially  given the journal type style of exposition  the missing housewife and the unreliable narrators  the look at Suburbia and the decay of social standards  the comparison with the bestseller  Gone Girl  is an obvious choice  Yet  I was definitely more invested emotionally and more convinced by the motivations of of Paula Hawkins  characters than by the  glamorous  and perverted couple in Gillian Flynn s potboiler  The differences are subtle in the beginning  and the defining moments come late in the economy of the new novel  I know I have been using a lot of spoiler tags  but I think it will be best to explain my point of view also like this  view spoiler   Flynn is a showoff  her couple too contrived and too calculated in their game of oneupmanship to amke me look at them as real people instead of actors in aply  Hawkins writes deeply flawed persons  who make mistake after mistake  each and every one of them  women in the beginning  and men revealed in the later stages for the hollow shells they are  Flynn writes for the clever plot twist  Hawkins kind of points at the identity of the culprit early on in the tale  at least it was obvious to me  Flynn s couples are concerned with power games   who dominates who  Hawkins is interested in the liberation of women   from domestic violence  from lack of horizons in a stay at home wife  from double standards in morality  All three women   Rachel  Megan and Anna   are in the beginning unpleasant  unreliable and hard to empathize with  Yet there is a reason for the way they turned out  Tom s cheating  Dr Kamal s unprofessional atitude towards a patient  Scott s weakness of character  The tragic outcome is not the result of yet another timely plot twist  but a credible and sad result of years of abuse  The biggest liar in the novel and the most despicable character turns out to be not one of the three women  but Tom  who also has a native talent for sophistic untruths that justify his self obsession  Do you have any idea how boring you became  Rachel  How ugly  Too sad to get out of bed in the morning  too tired to take a shower or wash you f  ing hair  Jesus  It s no wonder I lost patience  is it  It s no wonder I had to look for ways to amuse myself  You ve no one to blame but yourself  I know which of the two tales will remain longer in my memory  and it s not  Gone Girl   hide spoiler  One more reason why I prefer  The Girl on the Train    I personally love trains  and I have on my bucket list a TransSiberian holiday  Rachel was also planning something like this  Before when I was still myself  I used to dream of taking romantic train journeys with Tom  The Bergen Line for our fifth anniversary  the Blue Train for his fortieth  Having remarked on how much I appreciated Paula Hawkins psychological insights and subtle characterization  I must confess that I also had some doubts about her style  understandable though for a debut novel   heavy handed hints and foreshadowing  I wish I had counted how many times I had my attention pointed at that  underpass by Blenheim Road   of the three women  Megan was the most convincing and Rachel the least  Some of Rachel s actions may have been driven by alcohol consumption  but I believe it took her a really long time for her to read the clues   not much of a mystery about whodunit  but that s OK  since the characters motivations were more interesting than the identity of the killer   the final confrontation was slightly forced  Hollywood thriller style   view spoiler   I would have rather had less killing and a long stint in jail for the culprit  Also  Rachel dexterity with a blade felt out of character   hide spoiler  Anyway   recommended as a well written and deeper layered than expected psychological thriller  I would read the next Paula Hawkins novel  Video Review Coming Soon  Loved this one and couldn t put it down  I don t get why all the comparisons are being made to Gone Girl  On a side note  the last three books I ve read all involve sociopathic husbands who lie and cheat on their wives  It would be nice to read a book for a change where the husband is normal   Trust no one   Rachel  the girl on the train  got involved in the mystery of the missing Megan which she named  Jess  while watching them  Scott which she named Jason  from afar and assuming their perfect marriage life  As she looks for answers  a lot of other mysteries were also discovered including her ex husband which is Tom and his new wife which is Anna  The book was narrated by these three women  Rachel  Anna and Megan   Rachel is the ex wife who lives under Cathy s roof while pretending that she has work even though she s really just broken and alcoholic and tends to forget and violent whenever she s drunk  I have my sympathy to this girl so much  she did her best to help those people even though no one believes in her  or thinks she s just having a hallucination  It s good that she did her best to finish this once and for all Anna is really annoying but somehow I understood her  she values her family so much but at the same time I m happy that she had a taste of her own medicine  In the end  it s great that she has awaken from her senses Megan is a creepy woman  That s all I can say for the purpose that I don t want to spoil you   As for the other main characters  find out for yourself guys       LIKES   The story is very interesting  I usually don t analyze stuff because I want the story to unfold by itself  Because I personally like mystery and thriller kind of books   Although it didn t hold my attention that much because I m still busy with other stuff  I love how it ended   The Author was excellent in confusing the readers  You really can t judge anyone based on little and poor evidence  DISLIKES   It s really depressing but I understand it s part of the story   The dates are really confusing or it s just me because I didn t read it in one sitting  I need to re read some parts before I can follow with the flow  BEST LINES  I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts  Who was it said that following your heart is a good thing  It is pure egotism  a selfishness to conquer all   It s impossible to resist the kindness of strangers  Someone who looks at you  who doesn t know you  who tells you it s OK  whatever you did  whatever you ve done  you suffered  you hurt  you deserve forgiveness   He smiles    that wide  beautiful smile that used to make me melt    and I start to sob  I can t believe it  can t believe we are brought to this  that the greatest happiness I have ever known    my life with him    was an illusion   FINAL WORDS The story regarding the main characters will teach you a lot of lessons in life    especially in the area of marriage and family  It will also teach you the consequences of alcohol and even sex addiction  I suggest that you read this book because it s wonderfully written and I don t have plans to compare it to Gone Girl  Both have their unique spots in their plots It s a nice read  So how many people go through life thinking so many people seem to have it together more than us  Well everyone has their skeletons  torments and sometimes unbalanced mental health    Hence this thriller that keeps you guessing who did it  In a fitting turn of events I am suffering a hangover today from reading this book filled with the black holes of alcohol soaked brains  You see  mine is the better type  the book hangover  earned when I have stayed up most of the night to finish a novel  I swear I do not have a problem  I can stop reading anytime I want really  The fact that I did not want to read this overhyped book apparently did not matter because I was still drawn in by the title  the cover  the synopsis  and mostly the way it followed me everywhere I went with gratuitous advertising splattered over every book store  digital and brick walled  Was it worth it  Let s see  I got what I asked for  it was psychological  I learned much about why it is bad to slip into alcoholism  and I learned that crazy men apparently attract women like flies  This story is told in the first person perspective of three women  one drunk  one self righteous  and one with PTSD  and all are mentally unstable  The characters are not very likable  but I could not help but feel for Rachel  even though I pretty much wanted to slap her for everything decision she made  But this is a story and without obviously flawed characters where would we be  I cannot say If I was surprised or shocked with the developments  but I sure was changing my theories as I read trying to one up the author with my own twists and turns  Overall  with a one handed yawning salute I have to admit I did like it  Could I have gone to sleep and finished today  I thought I could  but I didn t  I wanted to know who did it  There it is  the truth  Now that it is over  most of the details will soon be forgotten  It is no literary masterpiece  but the author did her job and made me want to know  Should you read it  Sure  you ll love it or hate it  And you can stop anytime you want to  I promise  I enjoyed this book but I guess I expected more  It is a good thriller and has a good  satisfying conclusion  The story revolves around 3 women  Rachel  who has a drinking problem  Megan and Anna  This story is told mostly from Rachel s POV and she isn t really understood  herself included  until the end  I gave it 3 5 stars but rounded up to 4  This may be a first work by Ms  Hawkins but it s masterful  It s quite a trick to dislike virtually everyone in the book and yet stay in there as you get deeper into the lives of these wretched people  their lives  illusions  weaknesses and lies  And yet       It s quite a read  one of those compulsive reads populated with people intertwined with each other s in ways you wouldn t suspect  And even though you know when you pick up the book you know it s is actually a crime novel  you re stunned when you find out it actually is  You may look for the omnipresent  omniscient cop to solve it  but the  detective  may be among the most unusual characters in the annals of murder most foul  As the book dances from revelation to revelation  I found i had to stop and really think about how each character incident related to each other  This is a book that needs to be read carefully even though it often feels as though you re trying to make sense of things after you ve spent an evening being totally high and have to piece together what happened last night  But that s part of its genius  Warning  Don t look for it to mean more then a helluva good read  Sometimes books transcend the genre and give you some thought it theme to ponder over  I found none  which is why i only gave it four stars  But it is one helluva read  Highly recommended  I am so tense  I just finished  the Girl on the Train  and still can t relax  Could not put this book down  Reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock s  Rear Window   A great psychological thriller  I would rate 4 5 stars if I could  It was one that I wanted to get through so quickly  The story was captivating yet well paced  I was so intrigued throughout the entire book and I never thought it dragged  Plus the outcome was relatively unexpected through the course of the book until a certain point where there is some good foreshadowing  There was excellent character development although every character is an awful person  Well done and I will look for more books from the author   This book was one of those I couldn t stand to put down  The story was taut and suspenseful  and kept me guessing from chapter to chapter  The narrators almost felt like people I knew personally and it made the story more vivid and real  This was way better than Gone Girl  still dark and twisty  but much more satisfying overall  I would highly recommend it to everyone  Definitely a good mystery thriller book  If you don t mind waiting until the end to find out the whole story  then this is an amazing mystery  I usually hate books with more than one point of view and dates at every chapter  how are you supposed to keep everything straight    but in this book  the flow actually works well  Definitely recommend this read   I don t think my two opinions about this book are incompatible  In one hand I loved it and read it in 24hours because I was totally hooked  On the other hand I don t think of it as a good book  I really enjoyed reading this  I like these kind of psychological thrillers and mysteries where you have to figure out with the protagonist what s going on  Unfortunately it doesn t go beyond entertaining  it s not remotely deep  the characters are underdeveloped and the story doesn t hold well together  because of the characters  and because of the incompetence of the police who could have been waaaay more effective in this case  I don t know if I was supposed to feel sympathy for Rachel and root for her but it just didn t happen  Also  she undergoes a character transformation in record time that s is just not believable  The chapters from Megan and Anna s point of view are just there to add to the mystery and I though that was kind of a cheap shot  Would have liked to hear more about his women or not at all and let Rachel tell the story I heard there s a movie in the making  stellar cast and all   I m curious about it because even if I enjoyed it as a book  I pictured the movie in my head and it could be a really bad one  Let s see    This book is basically Gone Girl as written by someone with a firmer grip on the English language than Gillian Flynn  No 35 word long sentences or embarrassing and repeated misuses of the word  literally  here  Just a well crafted thriller with a wonderfully flawed protagonist who you re never sure will overcome her personal demons until the very last page  It doesn t quite stick the landing  but for the first 90  of the book I was very  very impressed by the storytelling  audio version  one of the narrators was so annoying  it was hard to get past that  but the story kept me going a page turner with a strong message  stay away from alcohol and drugs  especially if you have tendencies to become addicted to them what was curious was that none of the characters were likable  often  one finds a character  that although flawed  has other redeeming qualities not here  and yet you can t stop reading I guessed the story line way before the end  but it did not distract from the tension  ReviewNarrated by three women  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  this is an enjoyably twisty thriller reminiscent of Patricia Highsmith  Agatha Christie  and Hitchcock s Shadow of a Doubt with a bit of gaslighting thrown in for good measure  Anna  the most stable but least likable of the trio  is married to Rachel s ex husband Tom  Megan lives on the same street as Anna and Tom  and worked as their child minder for a time  And Rachel has a voyeuristic obsession with watching Megan and her husband Scott from the window of her commuter train  Both Rachel and Megan have reasons for their emotional fragility which evoke both sympathy and irritation  but are central to the plot which centers on the disappearance of one of the women on the night that another is in a drunken stupor and the third isn t where she said she was  Although I figured out who did it  why  and how before the end I was intrigued enough to keep listening  The three narrators who voiced each of the women were all excellent  Bueno  libro finalizado  Un buen trhiller  no es de los mejores que he leido pero es muy bueno  Me sorprende que esta escrito en primera persona a pesar de haber diferentes protagonistas  es por casi completo narracion  aun asi esta recomendada su lectura  He visto que han hecho la peli  esperemos que no destrocen el libro    I liked this book a lot and that s saying something because I didn t particularly care for any of the main characters in the book  As anyone who knows me and reads my reviews  that is usually the kiss of death as far as I m concerned  However  Ms  Hawkins writing style hooked me  This book is a fast read and I was looking forward to finding out how she was going to tie it all together  And then  in my opinion  she took the easy way out  That s when my review went from five stars to four  I m not much at picking up on clues or figuring things out but at a pivotal place in the story  the penny dropped  Luckily  it came at least three quarters of the way through and I still wanted to see what would happen  I am looking forward to Ms  Hawkins sophomore effort  Scary especially for someone who has had similar experiences  Not that I personally have had   The Girl on the Train  is definitely a captivating thriller  It took me a while to get into though  If I didn t know how popular it is  I would have given up after the first few chapters  Also  it felt a bit reminiscent of  Gone Girl   but that may be because I don t really read thrillers  Those are the only two reasons not to give the book a full five stars though  Once I hit halfway  I couldn t put it down  Even once I knew who had done it  I had to see how it played out  Great airplane or beach read since it s all encompassing but doesn t really leave an after effect  like obsessing over the characters  wanting to read more  needing to download a sequel  etc    Here are two quotes I particularly liked   T he sense of shame I feel about an incident is proportionate not just to the gravity of the situation  but also to the number of people who have witnessed it   He lay on the bed  watching me as I got dressed  He said   This can t happen again  Megan  You know it can t  We can t keep doing this   And he was right  I know we can t  We shouldn t  we ought not to  but we will  It won t be the last time  He won t say no to me  I was thinking about it on the way home  and that s the thing I like most about it  having power over someone  That s the intoxicating thing    One word     Convoluted  Well written and intriguing    Loved it  Great Read I was immediately swept up in this book  The character development was believable and thorough  The insight into their lives was creepy and real  Real lives are messy and unhappy sometimes  I thought this book brought that to light and then preceded to twist it and distort it till you were on the edge of your seat  I was slightly disappointed with the ending but I would totally recommend it  Vous voulez lire un thriller  mais surtout pas avec plein de sang  de tueur en serie et une multitude de corps  Alors ce roman va surement vous convenir    Prenez un petit instant pour lire ces quelques lignes et je suis certaine que demain a la premiere heure vous serez chez votre libraire prefere avec le cafe et le nom de ce bouquin sur les levres Paula Hauwkins signe un premier roman bien ficele  qui va  sans vous en rendre compte  vous rendre tres addictif  C est bien gentil tout ca  mais il parle de quoi ce bouquin Ecris a la premiere personne  ce roman est raconte par trois femmes avec des decalages dans le temps La premiere est Rachel  C est une femme qui a presque tout perdu  Son mari  son boulot  sa sobriete  Elle s accroche a des futilites pour tenir le coup  comme la regularite du trajet qu elle s impose tous les jours  cet arret systematique devant cette maison qui ressemble en tout point a son ancienne maison  Et ce couple  qu elle idealise  Megan et Scott    Jusqu au jour ou Megan disparait  Le probleme de Rachel  ce sont les trous noirs du a l alcool  Je ne sais pas ce que j ai fait  Qu est ce que j ai fait   Entre dix sept heures et vingt deux heures  qu est ce que j ai fait   Pourquoi Tom est il parti me chercher   Qu est ce que j ai fait a Anna   Je tire la couette sur ma tete et je ferme les yeux   Je m imagine aller jusqu a la maison  remonter le petit chemin qui separe leur jardin de celui des voisins  passer par dessus la barriere en bois  Je m imagine ouvrir la porte coulissante et entrer discretement dans la cuisine  Anna est assise a table  Je l attrape par derriere  je glisse une main dans ses longs cheveux blonds et je tire la tete en arriere  je la fais tomber par terre et lui eclate le crane contre les carreaux froid du carrelage bleu La seconde est Megan  une jeune femme depressive  paumee  Elle cherche quelque chose qu elle ne trouve pas dans son couple  Va t elle nous

qui est une verite et qui prend tout son ampleur dans ce roman L homme est parfois assez fou pour preferer le chagrin a l oubli    Maurice Chapelan  Lisez ce roman     je n ai rien d autres a ajouter   http   lesciblesdunelectriceavisee bl    A good read Suspensful  and full of little twists and turns  Rachel rides the train every morning and stops at a switching station where she gazes upon the inhabitants of the houses along the tracks  She fantasizes about the life of one couple she sees everyday  until one day she sees the woman in the paper as a missing person I don t want to give things away but Rachel  Megan  and Anna are all interesting and complex female characters  The story is believable and filled with subtle complexities  The  Gone Girl  comparisons almost turned me off of reading this book as I wasn t much of a fan of that book  Happily  the only way this book is like Gone Girl is that it s a pretty good mystery written by a woman  Oh  and  I guess a woman disappears  But  I liked this book much better  I thought the mystery was wonderful  it took me until the last 75 pages to guess the twist  And I still couldn t put it down  Oh  there was one other similarity to Gone Girl  everyone in this book is pretty terrible  There is no clear protagonist   a LOT of antagonists  If that bothers you  you may not like this book much  but I thought it was a great read    Blackouts happen  and it isn t just a matter of being a bit hazy about getting home from the club    Tom bought me a book about it  Not very romantic  but he was tired of listening to me tell him how sorry I was in the morning when I didn t even know what I was sorry for  I think he wanted me to see the damage I was doing  the kind of things I was capable of      Rachel Soooo    I was so excited to read this book  I downloaded the ebook the morning it was released  It is a very emotional thriller  Not fast paced by any means  But it was so emotional and raw that I was sucked in  I finished it in less than 2 days  I have honestly never read a book where I despised every character  yet kept wanting to read more  Very well written  so full of raw emotions  and pure craziness  Every chapter revealed a new piece of the story that sucked me in further  This book is written in alternating characters on alternating dates  Often I had to scroll back to the beginning of the chapter and make Kindle notes to keep track of who was telling the story and when  With each chapter the author slowly doles out more clues to the crime from different character perspectives  Therefore my perception of character personalities and what I thought happened changed after nearly every new chapter   I don t want to give away the ending  but let me just say it was the reason this wasn t a 5 star book  Granted  I didn t figure out  who did it  until about 3 4 of the way through  but it was the last couple chapters that just seemed so  blah   For a slow paced thriller the finale happened in such a huge rush  I actually had to re read the last few chapters thinking I missed something  I am looking forward to reading another book from this author in the future though   I feel like I should also add that I never finished reading Gone Girl  I tried multiple times but found it too dull and boring  The reviews I ve read online often compare this book to Gone Girl  This book was of course better because I finished and I finished it fast  I love when I m surprised by the ending of a thriller murder mystery  and The Girl on the Train was one of those stories  It s also been unusual lately for me to read a novel without skimming over parts and becoming bored  but I found myself going to bed early so I could read this book   and reading it until much too late  That said  The Girl on the Train is not a cheery or uplifting novel  Many have compared it to Gone Girl and the movie Rear Window  I can see why  As in Gone Girl  it was difficult to like the characters  although I did root for poor Rachel   and TGOTT contained the voyeurism and psychological suspense of Hitchcock s Rear Window  I m not sure if I d want to see the movie  I understand DreamWorks has picked it up  unless it is done  Hitchcock style  rather than as a sappy melodrama I m glad I read it  but my next read will be something more inspirational and enriching  This book has been hyped much in the pre publicity and I can understand why  After a slowish start  I finished it at a sprint and rarely put it down  The girl on the train is a voyeur  she watches people in their houses  On her morning commute  her train regularly stops at a red light and she looks at a house and ponders the perfect life of the people who live there  She is fantasising  you think  and then you realise she isn t  She knows the people  Or does she You never know where you are with Rachel s account of what happens  she is the ultimate unreliable narrator  The problem is she is a drunk  a falling over  hungover woman who swigs alcohol on the train and suffers memory blackouts  At no point do you know whether to believe her version of the truth  She says   I wonder where it started  my decline  I wonder at what point I could have halted it   In contrast to Rachel  there is Megan  the woman who lives in the house by the railway  She seems a more reliable source of information  or is she  She is unhappy too and we are uncertain why  Dissatisfied   with her marriage  her life    she goes to see a counsellor  She hints about  betrayals  For the first half of the book I got the two women slightly confused  not their current life but their back stories  Then a third female voice is added  Anna  Anna was clear to me from the beginning  and her viewpoint adds clarity to the wider picture This is a thriller about men  as seen by women  about relationships  as seen by women  about truth and lies  and our ability to recognise one from the other A great debut  He who never took a peek into somebody else window  throw the first rock    Good characters and a good story  that lets you go inside of Rachel s head  understanding the drama of her life Inspite off that  it s not as good as Peter May s The Blackhouse  Bi dahakine hatirlatin da gece gece polisiye  gerilim tarzi kitaplar okumayim This one of those books where I didn t particularly warm to any of the characters  but easily journeyed through as a result of the narrative I enjoyed the three voices that make up this story  but also hate the current trend of 1st person narrative  even when the person is dead   thus could not have written what is read  Rachel s constant  Sorry  grated as the story progressed   they were just words  with no meaning or contrition  Seeing how other s saw her   especially the police   as a result of her being a drunk was interesting  So  you are an unreliable witness if you aren t a pillar of society with no vices  I much rather see them  then the suppressed ones you are hiding  Anna is a right bitch   scarily obsessive  I m glad she wasn t my mother   I am aware she was  normal  when regarding parenting  but I thought of her as controlling and in need of psychiatric help  It was interesting how the police treated Anna in contrast with Rachel  Megan was at least honest with her faults It is a great mystery  I worked out the solution 2 CDs from the end  but enjoyed watching it unfold to it s twisty conclusion  Unlike other new novels of this ilk that have been hyped to a ridiculous level  there is some substance to this novel with only minimal editorial errors  This is a well written  engaging whodunnit with a compelling  flawed protagonist  As I got closer to the end of the novel  I didn t want to put it down My full review is here  http   mysteriousbibliophile blogspot    From the get go  a palpable emotional energy exudes from this novel  you feel yourself sitting next to  The Girl on the Train   Rachel  she s narrating to you  pointing out what she sees on her daily commute to and from London  You re looking over her shoulder  focusing on landmarks outside the moving train window  trying to see what she s straining to see in a residential neighborhood located just beyond the train s tracks  You can smell her booze soured sweat as you lean towards her  trying not to jostle her alcoholic beverage  a commuting home indulgence that s become too habitual  You know you re going to shadow this woman for the duration of the story   the character of Rachel has hooked you   author Paula Hawkins has hooked you  Some reviewers complain that the plot pushes the limits of credibility  Well  all I can say is   IT S FICTION   IT S A MYSTERY STORY    So  get a grip  The Girl on the Train is no less believable than any tale or movie script that Alfred Hitchcock managed to churn out  To me  the sign of a good book is how easily your find yourself surrendering to the story  Ms  Hawkins captured my interest without extraneous preamble  she didn t make me wait unnecessarily to board the train  she didn t tease me   the story started off at a fast pace  and didn t slacken I can get lost in a book  and nothing else matters   the dishes can wait  I ll return phone calls and emails tomorrow  I ll give the dog a quick walk  and I ll don my  Do Not Disturb  facial expression  I ll read on  ripping through the pages until I know how the book ends   I needed to know how The Girl on the Train ended Job well done  Ms  Hawkins  Great read  Sometimes not a fan of perspective and setting shifts in fiction  but this one played out well   I really enjoyed this  A good mystery with a lot of not entirely surprising twists  It revolves around some seriously flawed people who make a number of poor choices  but I felt for Rachel and Meghan  There was a part when I thought aloud   I don t particularly like anyone in this story   But I still wanted to know what happened  The audiobook is performed by three different people  and the reader for Meghan was perfect  She made her real to me It s not great literature  But it s a quick and suspenseful read  Great story  When I finished  I felt it deserved four stars   so that s what I m going with  However  the longer I sit on reviewing  the less sure I am  The beginning was slow and I had to push through a bit to become interested  I won t go into specifics as to avoid spoilers  but I knew what was going on from very early in the book  Maybe that took some of the fun out of it for me  but there seemed to be lots of not so subtle hints dropped  I liked the characters of both Rachel and Megan  despite the messes they turned out to be  Although I enjoyed this one overall  I wasn t blown away  Side note  This does not even BEGIN to compare to Gone Girl  so stop comparing them people  Great thriller  The book is about Rachel who travels to London every day on the 8 04 am train and passes by a homes and she creates a story in her head about their lives  There is a particular home and a couple she observes more carefully and weaves a story about their lives but something happens one day and changes the way she sees people around her forever  The story deals with alcoholism  depression  extramarital affairs  lies we often tell ourselves that are not often thrown into a story so intriguing and psychologically numbing  The characters fit in and develop so well it s difficult to put the book down    4 5  3 5 stars really   Liked  but not loved Since I finished reading this book I have been tryong to decide what I have to say about it  Quite a few friends recommended this book to me and  of course  I was eager to understand what all of the literary buzz was about  I almost stopped reading when I got to about page 100 at which point I was doubting my own literary choices The book focuses on three women  Rachel  our protagonist and struggling alcoholic   Megan and Anna  who is currently married to Rachel s ex husband   Three men feature prominantly  Tom  Rachels s ex and Anna s current spouse  Scott  whose wife has recently been murdered  and a handsome doctor  The narrative follows each woman s point of view and switches time frame from pre murder to post murder  I found it helpful to make note of the the time references that appear at the top of each narrative section  I did not find the book depressing which I think I have read some reviewers mention  Unfortunately  I think many of the  daily life  elements in the book are real world happenings that Ms  Hawkins has coalesced in this psychological thrillerRachel struggles with her drinking and invents an alternate reality  She has lost her perfect home  husband and life which has exacerbated her alcoholism  Would things have been different if she had been able to conceive a child  Rachel suffers from black outs and one of those episodes has left her questioning her partial memories   if only she could remember  She also has lost her job due to her drinking but carries on with her daily commute so that she does not have to  fess up  to her job loss to her flat mate  Cathy   who has a supporting role  both literally as well as figuratively  Anna has the perfect life  husband and home that Rachel has lost  She has the baby too  Life is picture perfect   or is it Megan has a good husband who may have a wee bit of a temper problem  Megan also hides a troubling secret  Her husband suggests that she seek professionl counseling  Enter the handsome soothing doctor Mid book it all began to make sense to me  I understood the lengthy preambles at this point and I even had an inkling as to  who dun it   The last chapters in the book are suspensful  even you think you know how the books ends   So      my feeling about the book  It was a good read and I am happy that I hung in and continued reading  I can see how some people refer to the book as  Gone Girl revisited   Was it good  A resounding  yes   Was it great  I am not sure about that  If you like thrillers   suspenseful  psychological thrillers   I don t think that you will go wrong in reading this book  if you find  as I did  that the beginning was is a bit slow   keep reading  you will be glad that you did Final thoughts  This is a good book  but I am probably not on quite the same  5 star  band wagon that so many other reviewers and readers are  I became involved in the story from the beginning  Not really hearing too much hype on this book  I didn t have a lot of high expectations  On the cover of  The Girl on the Train it says that this is a Thriller  I d like to think of it as more as slow and simmering  working its way up to a full boil     Possible spoiler     As the story worked itself up to the boiling point  I started guessing who was the killer  Scott  Kamal  Tom  Anna  Rachel  I went back and forth  Scott  Kamal  Tom  Anna  Rachel  ScottKamalTomAnnaRachel     over and over   until I couldn t really decide  The ending was a little chase  a little drama  a little excitement    finally reaching the conclusion  I kind of wish it would have ended a little differently  but the tale along the way was fun  I enjoyed the book   Vaya vaya vaya   Este si que es un libro escrito de manera interesante y un tanto creativa  Debo admitir que hace mucho que no me divertia tanto leyendo el punto de vista de puras mujeres con problemas serios  que a veces odie y a veces adore   La chica del Tren es un viaje inesperado y agradable  si es que te gusta pasar medio libro preguntandote cosas y llegando a conclusiones apresuradas  Maldigo a mi mente detectivesca  siempre me mete en apuros y me obliga a apresurar la lectura para comprobar mis multiples teorias Lospersonajes son originales y sesienten realmente con vida  algo que es buenoconsiderando que todo es un gran Thriller lleno de emocion  A veces dudo sobre este tipo de libros amados por tanta gente en tan poco tiempo  pero este es uno de los que lo merecen  Interesantede principio a fin  Gran historia  Well written thriller book  You want to know how it ends  You stay up too late at night turning pages to get to the end  This book was recommended to me because I read Gone Girl  This book is better than that one   Really enjoyed this book  a great thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat  It s books like this that keep me with a book at all times  I think Gone Girl created a new genre of books  via Gillian Flynn   Much like western films are actually allegories for war trauma  I feel these  thrillers with a twist  are allegories for issues commonly experienced by women  Gone Girl addresses the kind of  manic pixie dream girl  expectations set out by society for basically looking like a super model  but being a combination of both mother   waitress to men  thank you Joan from Mad Men for the comparison    The double standard is then imposed when a man can  let himself go  and still manage to bang a girl almost half his age  In this book  I think there is a slight undercurrent  reviewing the power that men have over women  Each woman experiences some form of domestic violence  At no time are Rachel  Anna  or Megan in a place where they feel comfortable challenging the notions put forward by their husbands  That is  until a girl like Megan goes missing  So  too  does the author conquer alcoholism  in a way which leaves someone feeling both sympathetic and repulsed by Rachel  much in the way she feels towards herself   Perhaps neither of these points were at all intentional themes set out by the writers  but I am enjoying this new wave of fiction   I loved the book and the characters  A superb thriller after a while  I saw this being heralded as the next Gone Girl  However I liked this one more  This is a very clever book  If you have ever woken up wondering what you did the night before you will instantly identify with Rachel  the Girl on the a Train  Yes  she s an alcoholic  her life is a mess and she is living in a dream world grieving for the loss of the fairytale marriage she thinks she has ruined with her drinking and her general unworthiness but is that really the case  She spends her days pretending to go to the job she was sacked from and transferring her romantic daydreams onto the life of a young couple who live in a house just like she used to have when she was happily married  But then the fantasy couple become real people to her when the wife goes missing  Rachel is convinced she knows what happened to her but she was too drunk to remember if she was involved or what she saw  She is dismissed as an  unreliable witness  but she sets out to discover the truth  however painful it is going to be for her  There are no two dimensional characters in this book  no black and white  just a gradual revelation of their deep hidden secrets in a very true to life manner  These could be your own friends or neighbours  Suspend judgement and enjoy to the last very satisfying page   Great bookEnjoyed the book  I loved that I couldn t put it down  but ending was a bit of a disappointment  Otherwise would have given 5 stars This book was a book like no other i ve read before  I am a eighteen year old girl with a lot of energy who rarely likes to sit down and do something for a long period of time  I normally read sappy romance novels that include an infinite amount of cliches  This book was a thriller  not too scary  i m a big scaredy cat   but very suspenseful  Before I began reading the book I read a quote saying something along the lines of  the novel that will make you look at people differently   which i thought was not likely or true  However  the book was very eye opening  and speaks to the truth of trustworthiness in this world and how rare it truly is I liked that there were three girl narrators at different times  so as readers we received numerous points of view  My only complaint with this novel is that it lacked dialogue  a majority of the text was narration  which is key for a novel like this  however it made it more difficult to read  All in all  a book i would recumbent  Boy  talk about your unreliable narrators  Rachel rides the train every day to and from London and over time she imagines lives for a couple she frequently sees on her journey  Then one day she sees the woman with another man and the next day she learns that the woman is missing  feared dead  Can Rachel help the investigation or hinder it by telling authorities what she saw    or thought she saw  While Rachel is the primary narrator  there are two others  Even if you don t particularly like any of them  the story draws you in and keep you turning the pages faster and faster as you try to figure out what really happened  It took me awhile to get into this book   much like with Gone Girl  That being said  once I was hooked   I was hooked  I loved trying to figure out  who done it  while the twists and turns unfolded   It was not the absolute best book I ve ever read  but it was definitely one that I could not put down  I was very intrigued by all of the characters  and the author kept leaving me at the end of each chapter wanting to know more about each character  It was also an interesting look into what it s like in the day of an alcoholic  She did so much self shaming  and hated herself for her weakness  but she was so caught up in the cycle that she couldn t stop  Some say that this book was predictable  but I disagree  There were many possible predictable outcomes  but I couldn t pin down any one of them for sure  I thought the author did a great job keeping the reader guessing until the end  This book gripped me  I was on holiday at the time and I think I read it in a day   I could not put it down  I found myself empathizing with Rachel  but also found her incredibly frustrating  and I thought the characters were well rendered  The twist was ultimately great because of Rachel s perspective  and the unreliability of her narration  though I often wondered how on earth she managed to afford the train journey every day   or anything for that matter   but the ending was shocking to the point where I wasn t quite sure I believed it  as I don t think we got to know Anna enough to make it believable  Having read Gone Girl  which everyone wants to compare this to  I don t believe it was quite as shocking and engaging as I originally found that  and I don t think it should be compared to Gone Girl as that was much more focused in the situation and plot  This was a great read in that it was gripping  and I wanted to know what happened to the characters afterwards  and I found it very easy to imagine visually  and was exactly what I wanted at the time   When I saw reviews that this was one for fans of Gone Girl  I immediately wanted to throw down this novel and run far  far away  I was pleasantly surprised that this was nothing like the train wreck  no pun intended  that was Gone Girl  Comparatively  both novels featured crazy unstable and unreliable characters  Both novels feature a number of characters who narrate the story from their point of view and something dramatic happens  This is where the comparison ends The Girl on the Train opens with Rachel  who is a dull  depressed drunk who creates a fantasy featuring a couple she sees on her daily commute through the window of the train  One day  she witnesses an event out of the ordinary for her  Jason and Jess  Next  we meet Megan who is a young  newly wed and very bored  housewife  Restless  she recounts events that transpired one year before Rachel s  Then  we meet Anna who is debilitatingly paranoid and is connected to Rachel The events that follow the scene Rachel witnesses intertwines the characters in a fast paced  intricate tale  As the story unfolded  I changed my mind on several occasions as to whom I thought was suspect  Ruth Rendell will always be queen of the psychological thriller for me  but this one has plenty of the same elements  character first person narrative  slowly revealed back stories  plenty of creepy dysfunction  I read it pretty much in one sitting and found it quite satisfying in the Ruth Rendell tradition  Un thriller qu on a du mal a lacher une fois commence J ai quand meme du faire quelques pauses car Rachel  le personnage central  avait tendance a m agacer  j avais un peu envie de la secouer Quelques pages avant la fin j ai commence a comprendre le denouement et OH  je ne m y attendais pas J ai beaucoup aime avoir les versions des 3 filles  par contre j etais un peu perdu dans les dates au depart  3 5 5 livre addictif mais des personnages auxquels on a un peu du mal a s attacher  Update  08 02 2015If you d like to read this review on my blog Rating  4 25 5 stars The Girl on the Train is the thrilling mystery of a woman who saw something she wasn t supposed to and was at the wrong place wrong time  or was she  Deceptions  confusion  death and more are sure to follow along  told in the voices of not one but three unreliable characters  all women This book was difficult to put down  from the beginning to the end  It grips you close using the unknown  You just have to know what happened  is everyone ok  who is really bad and who is not what they seem From the beginning  the book plays with the image you construct yourself of the characters  playing with your mind and trust and making you question everyone and everything  Much like a great mystery must do The main character is Rachel  and she is just the most unreliable character you ll ever read  You can t trust her  at all  but you feel bad for her  and then think her a crazy bitch  and then not quite  In the end  you re left with a feeling that you might as well don t get close to her  even thought she s not that bad For everyone who said that this was a creepier Gone Girl  I don t agree  I mean  there are some similarities  view spoiler  The fact that Tom was such a psycho in disguise and the missing girl element  hide spoiler    but really  this book is different  And at times is a little bit more unsettling than Gone Girl  but I think Gone Girl is a whole different type of fucked up For the most part  this book was excellent  great writing  good plot line and nice twist  But the one thing I didn t like  and it s actually pretty big  is that I guessed what was happening way before the twist started to unravel  I never felt what was happening normal  so I questioned everything that the author let us know  and so I managed to figure out what was happening almost halfway through  Shame Hence the why I put a 4 25 rating  I never go hard with books I figure out way before the big reveal  because it happens all the time  But at the same time it didn t stay with me for a long time  so I considered that as well But do not let this discourage you  this book is a great thriller  really fucked up and nice for the mind exercise  Maybe you ll be taken aback by the ending  Who knows I recommend this to everyone  and yes  for the ones who are looking for a Gone Girl type of book  but don t expect it to be like it  And if you re soft hearted  be careful with it  I listened to this on audiobook and struggled through the first half of it  The characters are not very likeable but I was hooked on the second half  I really like how it ended  We went to London over Christmas and passed a lot of the stations referenced in this book  which is always cool  I guess I am surprised that people keep comparing it to Gone Girl  Maybe because the characters are not that likeable  Other than that  I would struggle to put them in the same category  It does twist and turn but in a natural way  I m not sure there was anything natural about Gone Girl  and I mean that in the best way possible because that was a great book     Rachel apanha todos os dias o comboio das 8 04 para Londres  E todos os dias o comboio abranda no mesmo sitio  e Rachel pode olhar para a casa de Jason e Jess  tentando apanhar mais um momento das vidas perfeitas que Rachel imagina que tenham  Mas  de repente  Rachel ve se enredada nas suas vidas quando Jess desaparece sem deixar rasto  Gostei imenso deste livro  Desde o inicio capturou me e nao me largou mais  as suas trezentas paginas voaram sob os meus olhos  mesmo sendo semana de exames  E um livro que nos traz as tres perspectivas das diferentes mulheres envolvidas na historia  e a medida que ia saltando de uma para outra  tinha a clara certeza de que estava a ser manipulada para me sentir de uma determinada maneira acerca de cada uma das personagens  e adorei esse sentimento  As personagens sao bem construidas  marcantes  cada uma com as suas imperfeicoes mas muito interessantes  A unica coisa que tenho a apontar ao livro e que nao surpreende por ai alem  Nao ha aquele momento em que lemos uma frase e tudo encaixa dentro da nossa mente e temos de parar de ler porque nao acreditamos que tal seja possivel  E um thriller mais calmo  em que aos poucos e poucos vamos pondo uma hipotese  e essa hipotese vai ganhando substancia a medida que avancamos mais um capitulo  e os detalhes vao se encaixando    Recomendo bastante esta historia  E uma leitura rapida  bem escrita e interessante  I finished this on St  Paddy s Day and I m still torn between 3 and 4 Stars  Paula Hawkins had me spell bound  Her writing is fierce   she certainly knows how to spend a very suspenseful tale  keeping the reader quickly turning the pages despite all of her very unlikeable characters Rachel is Tom Watson s ex wife  She is quite pathetic  She s a drunk and unemployed  But each morning she rides the train to London  to save face  pretending she s just another commuter  And the train always stops very near her old house where she was happy and hopeful with Tom  A few doors down live a beautiful couple that she s dubbed  Jess and Jason   She imagines their life together  giving them wonderful attributes and marriage  Looks can be deceiving as the real  Jess    Meagan   shows us  Tom s current wife hates Rachel and truly believes that Tom s ex wife is unstable and dangerous to her  Tom  and their baby daughter  Everything is going as smoothly as each woman s situation can go until one of them suddenly disappears  Rachel must interject herself in the investigation  After all  she s invested a year of mornings and evenings watching this woman  Bad decision  girlfriend The story line is told from each of the three women s altering POV  and that technique is powerful and makes the novel work  As I ve said there is not one redeemable or likeable character in the whole book  but the reader is also a Rachel   a voyeur of a sort like in Rear Window  Something bad has happened and we know it s coming and we can t shut our eyes  We readers must know what happened and by whose hands   I was surprised that my book group didn t like this book  in general  as much as I did  Yes  the characters are unlikeable  but they are just a smidge off plumb  I got a real  there but for the grace of God  feeling from some of the behaviors exhibited Psychological thrillers fascinate me and Paula Hawkins knows just how to create dread and uncertainty  And how many of us have to admit to looking into windows and creating perfect lives for the inhabitants  One of the things that seemed to bother the group in general was the use of specific wording that we all recognized from an e e  cummings poem   Life is not a paragraph  and death is no parenthesis   which appears rather early in the story  Read the last two lines of the poem since feeling  e e  cummings since feeling is firstwho pays any attentionto the syntax of thingswill never wholly kiss you wholly to be a foolwhile Spring is in the worldmy blood approves and kisses are a better fatethan wisdomlady i swear by all flowers  Don t cry  the best gesture of my brain is less thanyour eyelids  flutter which sayswe are for each other  thenlaugh  leaning back in my armsfor life s not a paragraphAnd death i think is no parenthesis How do you solve a crime when every witness is unreliable or a suspect  Twisty thriller with great characters  Excellent audiobook narration   Sehr schoner Thriller in einem interessanten Erzahlformat  Die eigentlichen Ereignisse  als sie am Ende aufgelost werden  sind auf ein paar Seiten erzahlt  interessant ist der Weg dorthin  Rachel hat keinen Polizeihintergrund  keine ubernaturliche detektivische Spurnase  sie hat nur einfach nichts besseres zu tun  als den Mord aufzuklaren  Bis sie sich so tief darin verheddert  dass sie nicht mehr rauskommt  Dabei kann man kaum anders  als sie zwischendurch anzufeuern  sich zu verbessern  und ihre wiederholten Abrutscher in den Alkoholismus tun dem Leser so sehr weh  als sei man selbst einer ihre Freunde Der Zug an sich ist ein schones Motiv  dass sich durch das ganze Buch zieht  Mir hat es sehr gefallen  4 5  Was a definite 5 but the ending fell a little flat for me  It was very  um  Hollywood   and not unpredictable   Great book though  It s been a while since I last read a page turner  and I don t know why but there s something about unreliable narrators that thrills me  Hot mess of a murder mystery I like that the killer is totally someone different than you d expect and that it is written from three perspectives  Would definitely recommend hardcover or paperback rather than kindle as the dates bounce around  It was a little hard to read about the constant drunkenness and alcoholism  and this made it a little frustrating in the first half from Rachel s perspective  because all I could think was get it together  But as someone who is trying to understand the disease of alcoholism and addiction for a family member in my own life it was helpful to sort of see their struggles  self loathing  and first hand disease  It sets the book up brilliantly as to how why the killer did what he did  Excited to discuss at book club   Rachel fahrt jeden Morgen mit dem 8 04 Uhr Zug nach London  Dieser halt immer an der gleichen Stelle und Rachel kann in die Garten der umliegenden Hauser sehen  Dort sieht sie ein Parchen  bei welchem sie sich vorstellt  dass sie das perfekte Leben fuhren  Sie nennt sie Jess und Jason Eines Morgens sieht sie jedoch etwas  dass das   perfekte Leben  von Jess und Jason auf den Kopf stellt und kurz darauf liest Rachel in der Zeitung  dass   Jess  verschwunden ist Rachel geht zur Polizei  meldet dort  was sie am Morgen gesehen hat und merkt dabei  dass sie wahrscheinlich mit dem Verschwinden von Jess zu tun hat Das Buch wird aus Sicht von drei Frauen erzahlt  Hauptsachlich kommt Rachel zu Wort  die mit ihren detaillierten Angaben ihre Tage wiedergibt Zwischendrin melden sich Megan und Anna zu Wort Alle drei Frauen haben Probleme  Allen voran Rachel  die   verlassen vom Ehemann  alkoholabhangig und arbeitslos   jeden Tag mit dem Zug nach London fahrt  weil sie es eben noch von ihrem fruheren Leben so gewohnt ist  Ihre Beobachtungen fuhren dazu  dass sie uber ihr Leben nachdenkt  sich fest vornimmt  einiges zu andern  aber mit der Gesamtsituation einfach noch uberfordert ist Die Autorin schildert auf dringliche Weise  wie sehr Rachel immer weiter abrutscht  bis sie durch eine Beobachtung feststellt  dass es sich lohnt  wieder fur etwas zu kampfen Es ist ein standiges Auf und Ab  und man mochte Rachel erst in den Arm nehmen und sie trosten  andererseits mochte man sie schutteln  damit sie endlich zur Vernunft kommt  Sie tat mir so unendlich leid  wie sie sich qualte Der Schreibstil der Autorin ist fesselnd  Nicht etwa  weil sie einen Spannungsbogen aufbaut  sondern weil sie es fertig bringt  sich in die Protagonisten hineinzuversetzen  So konnte ich mit Rachel mitfuhlen  Annas Verhalten nachempfinden und auch Megans Seite verstehen  Schonungslos gibt die Autorin Einblick in die kaputten Leben und lasst dabei meist sehr tief in seelische Abgrunde blicken Wie sich letztendlich alles zusammenfugt ist in meinem Augen sehr gut gelungen  obwohl ich schon ziemlich fruh eine Ahnung hatte  wie es wohl ausgehen wird bzw  wer hinter allem steckt Gerade durch die leise Gangart der Autorin wird die Geschichte zu etwas Besonderem und deshalb kann ich den Hype um dieses Buch dann doch verstehen  Ich wurde selbst davon in den Bann gezogen Die Filmrechte an dem Buch sind schon verkauft und ich bin gespannt  wie die Story dann auf der Leinwand wirkt  In gedruckter Form konnte sie mich auf alle Falle schon mal uberzeugen und ich werden mir Paula Hawkins definitiv mal merken Fazit Kaputte Protagonisten  kaputte Story   definitv etwas  das man gelesen haben sollte  An excellent premise  and the author has a great eye for human weakness  The world s most unglamorous detective makes for interesting story dynamics  The language is straight forward and the environment is only roughly described but on the whole a clever page turner that feels nicely different   The popular thriller is exciting with some slow parts which seem repetitious but serve to introduce small clues  It reminded me of Ruth Rendell s psychological puzzles  One of the best mysteries of the year and one of the all time bests  All the reviews say everything there is to say  It s not just  the next Gone Girl   it s much better in my opinion  Shades of Christopher Nolan s  Memento   Brilliantly written Hitchcockian murder mystery with corkscrew twists throughout and a final twist at the very end  Read it  OK  so I m a little late to the game with reading this book  It s been on my TBR list for some time and when I received it as a birthday present last week  I felt like I should promote it to the top of the pile as a thank you This bestseller is Paula Hawkins  first dip into the psychological thriller genre of fiction  although she is by no means a newcomer to writing  having been a journalist and writer of finance and business before moving on to writing romantic comedy fiction under the name Amy Silver  writing four novels including Confessions of a Reluctant Recessionista The Girl On The Train is an entirely darker direction I ll try to keep the plot spoiler free  Written in a first person narrative from the perspectives of Rachel  the main focus character  and Megan and Anna  whose lives and stories become interwoven in an interesting and compelling way Set in and around the London area in 2012 2013  the author structures the narratives in sections of specific dates  usually further still by sections of morning evening  and the story becomes even more interesting to read when the timelines of the characters fall out of sync with each other Hawkins  really pulls off these characters in terms of relate ability  Rachel is not just the cliche flawed and damaged divorcee   she is a total disaster  with no faith in herself   and her endless procrastination spoke volumes to me  Megan Jess and Anna also have anxieties hiding just under the surface that a lot of women will relate to  but this book also touches on the darker sides of emotional abuse  domestic violence and substance abuse and whether directly relate able or not  these grittier themes captured from a first person perspective really draw the reader in The Girl On The Train is a psychological thriller and does the genre proud  It is reminiscent of Gone Girl or Before I Go To Sleep but still holds its own in a vastly saturated market of similar titles At 320 pages long  this book is structured well and brings enough pace to keep the pages turning  I read this in pretty much one sitting and really enjoyed doing so As with many bestsellers nowadays  this book is being made into a movie  the rights acquired by Dreamworks  and is scheduled for release October 2016  so I would recommend reading this book before the film comes out as there will be inevitable changes   it has already been confirmed to be in New York rather than London All in all  a good thriller with an interesting plot full of suspense and rich characters  If this is Paula Hawkins  first entry in to the genre then I m excited to read what she does next  I don t know which is more exhilarating for me    to guess the  who done it  before the ending of a book or NOT to guess correctly     I thought I had it right  I really and truly thought I knew SHE  did it   but wonderfully  surprisingly  I was VERY wrong    Ahaha    Way to go  Paula Hawkins  Over the past several months  THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN has continually shown up in my Nook  to read  folder and in my Amazon Kindle  to read  folder as well  It seemed that I just could not ignore or get away from this book  Curiosity won  And I m glad it did  This is a wonderful book about first impressions as well as about LIFE and how quickly life can  and quite often does  get out of control for ANYONE and EVERYONE  I see as I look at websites for TRAIN that GONE GIRL is quite often compared to it  I get that  If you have read GONE GIRL  I can assure you that THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN by Paula Hawkins is even more worth reading  I love the twists and turns and reveals that happen slowly  subtlety  and always at just the right moment to keep me reading and wanting to know more about each of the various characters in the story  This amazing story that Paula Hawkins has written takes a hard  very honest look at the difficulty each of us faces on a day to day basis and how we cope with those difficulties  with fore thought and without I can t say enough good things about THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN by Paula Hawkins  I certainly will be looking into other books by her    It is an adult novel  though  so just keep that in mind  parents  if your teens are reading it  I would be sure to read it with them or at least stay connected with them as they read it    I m just sayin   From start to finish there was something off  something left of center    but in the right way  The characters  setting  dialogue all seemed at once harsh and dreamlike as if you were having one of those wacky dreams that seem so real it takes you a few minutes after waking to realize it was just a dream  I like the constant second guessing of the characters  the constant nagging in the back of your mind that you were missing something  You had to stay alert and hang on for the ride  The Girl on the Train kept me on my toes and reading late into the night   Well it turned out to be one hell of a page turner  Told from multiple character perspective  which has been a style offlate      one cannot put it down once you pick it up for reading  Language is decent  not much harsh stuff or obscene prose  except in few instances where the situation demands   suitable for all ages  view spoiler  The story is told from the perspective of different characters in the plot  namely Rachel  Megan  Anna  Rachel is the  girl  on the train or rather in the train who watches the houses along the tracks  especially the one near the signal where the train stops by everytime briefly  enabling Rachel to watch that particular house more closely She becomes obsessed with the occupants of the house and also starts observing their activities and their daily routines  One day she notices that the girl has invited a stranger to her house and seems to her like she is having an affair  After a few days she is able to relate a news item concerning the disappearance of a girl  with this house that she observes from time  She also learns the actual names of the house occupants from the news article From here the plots turns very interesting as Rachel tries to help the police to unravel the mystery of the missing girl  The police refuse to believe her due to her drinking habits  but she pursues further and tries to help Scott  who is the husband of the girl who went missing  Megan  Initially he belives her but gives up after sometime as Rachel is unable to remember everything that happened on the night of the disappearance of Megan  when she had also visited her ex husband Tom s to patch up for her past mistakes  Meanwhile Rachel looses her job is takes up to drinking and parallely runs around trying to solve the mystery   hide spoiler  Loved the ending when different narrators close in on the day of the murder and pin down the culprit I recommend this book to anybody

told through the eyes of a lonely and recovering alcoholic  Rachel Watson  as she sees something while waiting on the train headed into London  She doesn t know if what she saw was real but she must find out  Rachel Watson rides the morning train into London  While the train stops at a light  she imagines the life of a young couple she calls  Jason  and  Jess   She can see their house from her favorite seat  Until one morning she sees  Jess  with another man  She is hurt that  Jess  would do that to  Jason  and she relives her own jilted relationship  When  Jess   whose real name is Megan  goes missing  Rachel feels she must tell the police what she saw  When she feel the police don t give her information any real attention  she feels she must find out on her own  Will her sordid past be stacked against her  Will she ever happen to Megan  Can she trust her own eyes and memory in the events of Megan s disappearance The story is told in three perspective  offering events in various points of the timeline  Rachel s perspective as the current events while Megan provides the events leading up to her disappearance  I thought the book started out real slow and I was wondering what did Rachel really see or was it her alcohol fueled imagination  But the story speeds up quickly and the events leading to the identity of the person who was responsible for Megan s disappearance happens at a dizzying pace  There was a couple times when I had to stop and go back a couple of pages to make sure I read it correctly  By the end of the book  I was thoroughly shocked and thrilled at the revelation of the person s identity  I love a mystery in which the clues are subtle but when the dots are connected  they all make sense  I recommend The Girl on the Train as mystery thriller with so many twists  the final revelation is a shocker   Started out dark and depressing  but I am glad I stuck with it  Good psychological thriller involving the dysfunctional lives of three women and the men in their lives   I really debated between  liked it  and  really liked it  on the rating scheme  What did it for me was Hawkins portrayal of Rachel and her alcoholism  Like others have stated the characters portrayed in this book were a hot mess  Yes  a true statement  they all were  but don t we all have bits and pieces of our past which we unfortunately remember  Some pieces are more significant than others and in the majority of cases are moral issues  Hawkins was bang on  even down to the blackouts many experience from excess alcohol use  Some reviews have found Hawkins characters desperate  I agree to some extend but having witnessed loved us cheat and be cheated on and I continually ask why  I have experienced alcoholism and blackouts first hand  The only experience I have personally missed in this book was the lying psychopath  Like others  I had pretty much figured out who the real killer was but I didn t know why until I continued reading  Some compare this book to Gone Girl  thankfully  this was not the case  It takes a really long time to forget turning the page to 182 of Flynn s book and I was so glad Hawkins did not do this with this book  I m really glad I read it as the only reason I picked it up in the first place was because I was seeing it everywhere  A great twisty turny read    well plotted and fast paced  The Guardian review of The Girl on the Train described it as  amnesia lit    apparently a new trend where the main character is unreliable  or pieces of the narrative are missing  Think Gone Girl  As I Go to Sleep or How to be a Good Wife  Rachel  the main character  may have witnessed evidence in a possible murder case from her regular commuter train  but she s also a liar  a drunk and prone to blackouts  The interesting part is that pretty much all of the other players in the story are cheats  psychos and about as untrustworthy as they come  Have fun working this one out  I had to read one of the most talked about books of 2015  The story reminded me of Gone Girl with many surprising twists and turns  The ending surprised me a little and kept me up the night I read it  While I am not sure I would read another book by this author  as I am slightly tired of the Gone Girl genre   I enjoyed it and it kept me reading  One thing I really enjoyed was that I am a train commuter daily and understood the setting well and seeing people sometimes the same ones daily  It can unnerve you a little  I really enjoyed this book  4 stars instead of 5 because of bad language in the book  Although  the characters were not particularly likable I enjoyed the book a lot  Quite a few interesting characters       I like how Rachel s jumbled memories made the story feel more confusing  Tom is certainly such a piece of trash that he is easily disliked  I mean  really no good quality about him whatsoever  Scott not much better  I love trains in stories because there are so many motifs that can be used with them  I found it interesting how Meagan kept longing to take the trains to somewhere  anywhere  like they could take her to all the best places in the world  But in reality  trains can only take you to predetermined places  and often places that aren t really that great I was definitely engaged to find out what would happen  especially near the end  Just finished reading The Girl on the Train  It was a pretty good mystery novel  although it got a little intense at times with its depiction of alcoholism and spousal abuse  Overall I enjoyed it  Intriguing  and a bit disturbing  story  I like the staccato feel of the author s writing  The plot keeps moving and presents a series of twists which serve to emphasize the depravity of its characters  While many will feel it added to the authenticity and believability of the characters  I could have done with out the somewhat frequent cussing  I especially find this to be true when I listen to the audio book version of a story The quality of the reading in the Audible version of this book was excellent  I suspect I enjoyed the story more than I would have if I d read it  due to the performance quality  This book reminded of Gone Girl  and I am sure it will be a movie at some point  A psychological thriller that was very engaging  told by three points of view  with an outcome that can be predicted halfway into the story  An alcoholic woman who rides the train sees something amiss and then gets involved in a missing person s case while trying to sort out her own crazy life  While all the characters were nuts  I really enjoyed reading it  Interesting read Well written  good paced drama  Good character development with very plausible characters  You can see and empathize with the situations they got themselves into and from everyone s perspective  Wow  what a story  I was drawn in from the beginning  How could I not be  when someone is basically talking about being murdered  And then you have poor Rachel  a lonely drunkard cast out by her husband  A woman who is pretending to go to work every day so that her flat mate doesn t know that she was sacked months ago  A woman who has a fantasy about a certain couple  who happen to live just down the street from her ex husband and his new wife  Every day around the same time  Rachel s train stops at a faulty signal light  and she gets a glimpse of this beautiful couple s life  She imagines what they might be like  what the husband does for a living  and so on  One day  she sees something that shocks her  and angers her  Soon after  that young woman is missing  and Rachel thinks she knows what s happened to her  But this story isn t going to go the way you might expect it to  Rachel is in for far more of a shock than she could ever dream  Great intensity  an intriguing mystery  and a look inside the life of an alcoholic  I could barely turn away  Me ha gustado mucho  Me ha tenido enganchada desde el principio y eso que la Rachel me ponia un poco nerviosa  Me gusta cuando lo autores van cambiando de protagonista en cada capitulo y puedes ver perspectivas diferentes  There s no putting this book down after the halfway point  What a twist  Damn  Very well written thriller  with depressingly believable portrayal of domineering men and the women who are attracted to them  Gripping narrative  satisfying conclusion  trjmh yn khtb r shhrywr

this one  It was captivating and I loved how the story unraveled  Great plot twist  Though reading teasers about the  unexpected  plot twist made me hyper aware of all the characters and who could have done it   Story of 3 women all connected to Tom in some way and set in England  This is a pretty good mystery with many twists  I listened to the audio and at first it was a little hard to get the perspective  I advise looking at the  chapter headings  to help  It is read by different readers for the 3 women  Megan  Rachel and Anna   Really enjoyed this book  It is interesting how at the first  I thought this girl needed to get control of her life  I guess in a way  I thought she was being weak  But then you find out what has happened to her and my eyes were open  Reminds me to not judge people  you never know everything that has happened to them in their lives   This one had me from page 1  Great fast paced mystery   https   lolantaczyta wordpress com 20    A thrilling read but the main characters are all flawed and none of them likeable  Rachel s insights are honest and it s a good study of a troubled and vulnerable person coming up with  justifications  for her behaviour  The struggle with alcohol is well told and the downward spiral of her life quite credible  It was quite depressing that all the characters we re so self absorbed  selfish and rather one dimensional  I kind of felt they all deserved each other in a away  The main character  at her lowest  seemed oddly drawn to these people and the one person who was closet to her and showed her generosity of spirit was the one she didn t really value or respect until perhaps the end   Holy jeez   that was a good one  SPOILERS I rated this book 4 stars  I will rate a book 4 stars if I thoroughly enjoyed the book  but do not consider it one of my favorite books of all times  I reserve 5 stars for books that I consider my favorites  So yes  The Girl On the Train did remind me of Gone Girl in the beginning  but once you get to reading it you really forget about all of that  It has enough solid differences that gave me a more of a Hitchcock Rear Window type of vibe which I LOVED  The book focuses around the main character  Rachel  who takes the train into London every day  As she is on the train  she sees this house every day and observes the couple who live there as they enjoy breakfast  coffee  etc  As she observes the couple one day  Rachel notices something peculiar  A few day later  the wife who lives in the house  goes missing  Rachel takes this piece of information that she has discovered  and begins to try to figure out what happened to the wife  Every single character in this book is terrible  Now I don t mean that they weren t well  written  but they were just bad people  You could not trust ANYBODY in this book  which is what I liked about it  It really kept you on your toes  and hard for the reader to figure out the mystery  Lets talk just for a second about the main character Rachel  You want to love her and you want to hate her  She has been through a lot of trying times and some of those things I could personally relate to  However  how desperate and obsessive she became really turned me off from her as a character  The ending is what brought the whole book together for me  Especially the character of Anna  The whole last thirty pages  the reader has absolutely no idea what to think about Anna STILL and that was super intriguing to me  If you haven t read this book and love suspense  this is the book for you  Happy Reading   It s been a while since I ve made so much time to read so I could finish a compelling book  I enjoyed its intriguing premise and the evolution of the character Rachel  It s pretty fast paced  and while it doesn t have quite the twists of  Gone Girl   it would appeal to readers who liked that  One question that remained   view spoiler  Who told the news about Megan s first child  I thought only the therapist knew about that  and I don t understand why he would tell  Did I miss something   hide spoiler   Commuting  Catching the same train everyday  The same people  the same seat  stopping at the same places  This is reality for Rachel  Staring out of the window  watching the world go by  One couple Rachel decides to call  Jess   Jason  she finds particularly fascinating  With their seemingly perfect life  drinking coffee in the morning and appearing totally in love  Rejected by her husband who is now married again and a father  Rachel is struggling to move on  She is a lonely character  turning to alcohol for company and desperate for some kind of affection  When she witnesses an event at the home of  Jess   Jason   she can t help but get involved leading to many lies and complications along the way  Anything to feel appreciated and needed  Rachel can t help wondering if she knows more than she thinks  With her  blackouts  from too much alcohol  she needs to work out what she really knows before it s too late  An interesting read which I enjoyed  A few twists along the way which kept me guessing  Loved the awkward commuting parts  Reading this was a lot like  Gone Girl  in that it s  an addictive read about thoroughly repellent characters   One simply MUST know how it all turns out  There was enough tension and mystery to propel me through the book in about 36 hours  Not a perfect 5 stars because I guessed the outcome a little earlier than is ideal  I thoroughly enjoyed it though  creepy characters and all  It s a gripping summer read that hooks you and won t let you go   I really enjoyed the twists and turns in this thriller  The writing is great so that you can go inside the characters minds  It is a bit confusing at first with the characters since I was listening to the audio version  Each chapter is told by a different character and the dates vary  It is helpful to be able to flip through the book  Though the book has very slow inital pace where you might wonder if you can find a single reason to go reading book  trust me it will be soon a roller coaster ride  600  pages  read it in 1 5 days   Paula took her own sweet time to introduce us to her characters  their thoughts  their silhouette of ugly truth   guilts  Having known them all  you ll find yourself worrying about one or the other character at some point  No big fancy words but just crude feelings  isnt that how we all think   its the simplicity that eventually wins over  Paula has really managed to balance all the equations  she has a victim for every villain   vice a versa  However  it really makes you wonder was the incident that was holding up the whole book was worth it  Given the roller coaster ride I enjoyed  I would partially settle to have such a weak core incident for such an incredibly expressed train of thoughts P S  I wonder if men find it excruciating to go through such minute thoughts of a woman  but yes  its partially true that we overthink up to such extents  which Paula has used amazingly to use as a factor to build interest  Fast paced and original thriller  I think the back cover blurb mentions Hitchcock  and it did remind me of Rear Window  Interesting characters  plot twists that are actually surprising  and tight writing  Highly recommended  Hooked  Could not put this one down  it was so full of twists and turns that it keeps you guessing throughout  I finally worked it all out once I was three quarters through but I still needed to know the ending  I like how it jumps from all the female characters and goes forward and back in time so that you can put the puzzle pieces together yourself  very well written and quite looking forward to more from this author   Puede parecer generoso  pero me ha parecido que  una vez terminada  la novela era mejor de la impresion que me daba al leerlo Es una historia muy muy entretenidaMas aqui Quite a good psycho thriller    I wouldn t mind a movie made from this book  Interestingly  I found the characters of Scott and Tom almost indistinguishable in terms of the physical and emotional descriptors used by the author    while the three women were distinctively different   It was like swallowing the book  It took only 2 days to read so I just couldn t put it down  I wanted to know what would be there further  Very interesting and easy to read  Very compelling  One of those where you finish a chapter and delay lunch because you re already into the next one  Well  maybe just one more  Oh  this next one s short There have been many comparisons to GONE GIRL  but I felt like showering after I finished that one    two really evil people  Some not so nice people here  too  but they were grossly flawed rather than wicked  First person POV from three women  first wife  second wife  victim The story of the main narrator  Rachel  seemed very like a  qualification  at an AA meeting and I kept hoping she d sober up and fly right  Great  easy read  Very Gone Girl meets a train and an alcoholic in England  Super enjoyable  Would have preferred a less predictable ending after all of the twists and turns  but overall  highly recommend   I refuse to be the last person on Earth not to have read this book  so I did I also read The Library at Mount Char at the same time I liked this book much better I really appreciate a protagonist that has flaws And a drinking problem due to the collapse of a relationship is more than real Blackouts  Super scary The main character being a woman was somewhat of a new thing for me  but I found her sympathetic enough and I shed my sexism  eventually Loved the train Loved the houses Loved the intrigue This did not read as a first novel for me A pleasant surprise  I raced through it at top speed  staying up late to read  and I have a one year old at home who still doesn t sleep through  That s worth 4 stars   4 stars out 4  because I only give 5 star for books I think  or know  I ll read again  This  being a thriller  is not that type of book I ll lay my cards on the table  I read this wanting to understand the hype  and I fully expected to dismiss it as a potboiler  It isn t  It s a tightly constructed thriller with characters that are not only unreliable  but flailing about wildly all over the place  Everyone is a mess  And most are selfish in the extreme  There s not a character in the book to sympathise with  Even the children The telling of Rachel s story as an alcoholic is worth 5 stars  The author never lets a symptom pass untold  to the last page   Yet the telling is also sadly touching  Alcoholics are almost universally painted as repulsive and weak  in both film and on the page  but here the author relates the emotions behind every drink and every drunk  Rachel might be an alcoholic  and she might be overusing alcohol as a crutch  but it s not hard to understand why she behaves as she does  You don t have to sympathise with her  but you can understand her behaviour if you put yourself in her shoes The book isn t perfect  of course  I started to drum my fingers about halfway through  then almost immediately the author introduced something so unexpected that I had to put the book down to assimilate it  And there is an amnesia event  in all but name  that is believable  but convenient to the plot  But these are picky gripes that in no way spoiled my enjoyment If you want a dark thriller for a train ride or a flight  look no further  It s not going to change your life  but it will entertain you  as a book should  if you go in with your eyes open about what type of book it is  a dark thriller   what did just happen   is the question I asked myself when I finished it at 6 am  I love this book  not even like it  I LOVE it   Very easy book to read and very quick  I just wasn t in love with the story  None of the characters were particularly good or heroic  Meh  I want something that blows me away   If you want to read a good review of this book  I suggest Wendy Darling s  I will share my thoughts  however  I read a lot of mysteries  including short stories in Ellery Queen Magazine monthly  Hawkins first mystery was one I couldn t put down  A modern Agatha Christie  I d say  Interesting characters  plenty of convincing red herrings  and a good story   One thing  Wendy Darling  and others  have said the characters were  terrible  people  I don t think so  The reader gets to see beyond the public face these characters show  It could be a lesson for all of us  to understand the potential of all human beings to be cruel  even to commit murder  YOU think you re  kind   would  never   You have no facets of yourself that you don t reveal deliberately  Even the roommate  Cathy  who seems to show the most compassion  is not always kind  and  in fact  her kindness looks a lot like codependency  and is  therefore  withdrawn when her expectations of Rachel are not met   I  like my favored reviewer  Darling  also  figured out who the murderer was    I even felt a bit of a let down that it didn t turn out to be someone I hadn t even considered  But  on further reflection  I realized  had it been any of the other characters who acted as red herrings  I would have thought  I knew it   Had some character out of left field done it  one not so developed as the others  perhaps  I know that kind of outcome is always a huge disappointment  The truth is  I couldn t quit turning the pages  because I DIDN T know whodunnit   Simply put  this was a fantastic read from debut author Paula Hawkins  Unreliable narrators  twists and a fast pace guaranteed that This story is  at the beginning  about Rachel who takes the same train every morning  As she continues down the track  she passes the same stretch of houses each day and as the train slows  she watches a couple going about their daily lives  She s began to feel as if she knows them and has even created fictional names and scenarios for them  Then one day  watching them from her seat on the train as usual  she see s something that shocks her and changes everything  Unable to keep it to herself  she tells the police and becomes entwined in what follows and the lives of those involved  It s impossible to tell you anymore without giving something away and this is a book it s best to know as little as you can about before reading Inevitably  there have been numerous comparisons to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn  It feels like nearly every thriller with an unreliable narrator is  Like Gone Girl  I rushed through this book and clique or not  was hardly able to set it down  which hardly ever happens  For me though  that s where the comparison ended  Gone Girl felt much more convoluted  so I really appreciated the straightforwardness of this This book gets going almost immediately and doesn t take long to pull you in  It s narrated by three woman  Rachel  who narrates for the most part and also two other woman  Megan and Anna  Each narrative is written in the first person  with Rachel s part being in the present day  as is Anna s  Megan s part is a few months in the past  The use of present tense was a great choice here and gave it a real sense of emergency The characters were done fantastically and I seem to be in the minority here when I say that I really liked Rachel  Going by reviews I ve read subsequently  most people felt frustrated with Rachel because of her reliance on alcohol and self pitying attitude  Mostly  people wanted to give her a good shake  I  however  felt sorry for Rachel and really felt for her  I ve had experience with a lot of the issues that Rachel raised and so I felt a huge sense of empathy towards her  I thought she was an excellent protagonist and liked her from the start  I actually feel a little angry and disappointed that hardly anyone felt like I did about her  The important thing is though  that love her or hate her  you ll still likely think this book is great  Saying that  I didn t particularly like Anna  who narrated a smaller portion of the book and I questioned a turn of her character towards the end  Megan was fine  but felt a little flat at times in consideration of the others  She does however come into her own at one point when she recounts a tragic past happening Aside from this  the plot was fantastic and peppered with twists and turns  I did  however  feel slightly deflated at the end because I d guessed the perpetrator  Soon enough I didn t care though  because I was caught up in the narrative again Ever since reading this I ve been thinking about it loads and wishing I could read it for the first time again  Read it as soon as you can and I reckon you ll love it as much as I did  I listened to the Audible version  which was well done  and although I didn t like any of the characters except for her landlord who put up with a hell of lot more than I would have  it was still a compelling  read  That being said  I figured out about half way through who the killer was and that person turned out to be the biggest ass of all  Oh the tangled webs we weave       so 4 stars but only because the lives of these people were like watching a train wreck  novel thriller itu   bukan genre gw sebenernya   tp karena penasaran dari rekomen orang2 dan berita bahwa buku ini akan di film in  alhasil mutusin buat baca   kebetulan dapat hadiah menang quiz juga haha  dan ternyata     asli keren bukunya  bikin penasaran dari awal sampe lembar terakhir   dengan ada 3 pov wanita   gw beneran harus nebak2 siapa sih yang jahat  dan siapa yang innocent   dan dugaan gw pada dasarnya salah haha   keren lah si paula hawkins ini   padahal ini novel thriller pertamanya  rekomen  What a fantastic book  I m so glad I read it  because while it gave me a great deal of inspiration to write my own story it also managed to make me hooked  til the very end  I definitely need to read more books like this     Trust no one and everyone is awful Did I not just sum up the entire book or what  I know  I know  I rated it four stars and that sounded kind of bitter  It s like this  though  You have an alcoholic who cannot remember things for the life of her and needs to  a cheater that has some odd commitment issues  and a liar  one that doesn t feel bad about it  either   And that s just the women  Then you have an obsessive  controlling husband  a cheating husband  who  mind you  doubles as an ex for one of the other women   and a handsome spoonful of sugar therapist  Throw them into a blender  add an old train  a small neighborhood  and some tiny violins  What do you get  A mystery thriller  One woman goes missing  one of the women lives a few houses down from her with her new  shiny  and stolen  husband and baby on her hip  and the other obsessively watches her practically every morning from the window of the train because she really just has nothing better to do It s a clusterfuck from the start and as the book keeps going and going and going  you start to learn just how awful all of these characters are  All of them  I think the only two people void from this blanket term is our mystery redhead and the baby and only because she s not old enough to be awful yet  the only thing she s managed to do is get food in poor Mama s hair because she likes nothing but strawberry yogurt for breakfast  lunch and dinner  Even our beloved spoonful of sugar therapist is bad deep down Putting this aside  because it s making me sound bitter  I did enjoy this book  immensely  The writing style was gorgeous and the plot was wonderful  slow at first  like most thrillers  but as it picked up speed  I was engulfed  I could have done with some good people because I like to think that not everyone is awful past the face they put on  but what can you do  A book like this needed characters bad and untrustworthy  which every main character was  Even the bit characters were horrible  though  It was just a world full of cruel  merciless and vindictive people  really  It bothered me slightly  which is where the fifth star went off to  It s hard for me to give this book an entire 5 star rating because of the characters Nevertheless  I m done rambling on about it  This book was wonderful  Most are saying it s like Gone Girl  but because I ve only watched the movie  I m not at liberty to say if that s true or not  It s definitely not why I picked this up  though  Wow   when your main character is an unreliable alcoholic  things get more than a little fuzzy I really enjoyed this novel  I picked it up because of the comparisons to  Gone Girl   which I enjoyed  I have to say that I enjoyed  Gone Girl  more  simply because it was a very unique cat and mouse game  I will say that for as much as I enjoyed it   The Girl on the Train  left me with a few unsatisfying bits  namely that someone can suffer repeated  concussion inducing head injuries and somehow just walks out of the hospital with stitches  I had a concussion when I was a kid  hit my head on the bottom of a concrete swimming pool   and let me tell you  you re not just getting sent home with that  I couldn t see straight for days  and you re forced to be kept awake to make sure you don t fall asleep and never wake up again  Rachel has been hit in the head three separate times  the first time so hard that she has lost memory  This is evidence of brain damage  and yet at the end of the novel  she s able to walk out of the hospital with only stitches  No way  They d be keeping her for observation  and there s no way she would have been questioned before they took her to the hospital  Concussion rant aside  the ending felt too neatly wrapped up after some very long winded ways of getting there  It jumped the tracks a little  see what I did there    rambling on for far too long  in my opinion  While Hawkins writes some fabulous character growth  I would have liked to see Rachel grow into a more likable character  Because I wasn t rooting for her at the end  and I think that s maybe the biggest problem  I just felt ambivalent towards the characters by the end  Anna was so wrapped up in her unearned self righteousness  that even when she did the right thing it was too little too late  This was a bittersweet reading experience  It was terrifying in a similar  although not as traumatizing  way as  We Need to Talk About Kevin   something to do with things spiraling out of control  losing yourself  and not being able to trust your own perception of things  The panicky feeling of   what if I become this  what if this is what my life turns out to be like  is very personal and very hard to shake off  At the same time  this was also a highly entertaining thriller  I ve seen too many reviews complain that it was easy to tell who the culprit was  which is slightly baffling  I feel the author did a great job building her story  holding your hand  leading you through suspects  and giving you enough clues to suspect person A or B or C or D  Even if you managed to figure it out  so what  It was still a cleverly unfolding mystery with interesting characters  My complaint would rather be about the ending  which stretched my suspension of disbelief  But overall  it was fun   That was a really interesting book  Very creative and its storytelling in the the role that trains play in the story  At first I was annoyed at the switching of narratives but it is really important to the story line and it was well done  Smart story that will stick with you  Hard Copy   This was a solid thriller that kept me guessing and reading until its surprise ending  The story is told by three very unlikeable women muddling their way through miserable lives all based on egos  lies and alcoholism  They are characters that would be hard for anyone to care about  but they are expertly developed and their individual twisted points of view combined with the bizarre murder makes the story a compelling  suspenseful read  It loses a star for unnecessary bad language  but the audio version is so well done it gained that star back  The voices for Megan and Rachel were awesome  I loved their accents and I think they did a phenomenal job  Anna s voice  however  was annoying   The Girl on the Train A very good book to read when on a sunlounger soaking up some rays  I read this in a day and half  I liked that every character has multiple flaws  it s odd how us readers enjoy reading about characters that we dislike  Out of all the characters  I liked Anna the least  She stole a woman s life   taking Rachel s husband and house   and then didn t appreciate Rachel finding it difficult to let go and not hold a grudge  Hawkins has written of Rachel s despair so well  The depression is so real   Rachel can t see it  but the reader can  Even though Rachel is somewhat irrational and out of touch with reality  it s difficult not to feel protective of her  because she s so vulnerable  I found myself frustrated with her weakness for alcohol  wanting her to stop   but that s how alcoholism is  I read the last 150 pages in a morning  my legs in the pool and the sun on my back  the pages getting splashed by swimmers but I didn t care   I would ve finished the book right then and there even if there had been hail stones   The Girl on the Train is about a collection of imperfect people whose lives intersect over the course of a couple of months  The story is set outside London and told from the perspectives of three women  Rachel  Anna  and Megan  Rachel is an alcoholic and  the girl on the train   She has no car  so she travels back and forth to work via train  Every day  she passes by the house that she once shared with her ex husband Tom  who s now married to Anna  Rachel also sees the house a few doors down where Megan lives with her husband Scott  From the train  Rachel imagines they have an idyllic marriage   until one day when Megan goes missing While the twists aren t as intricate as the mysteries in  Gone Girl   and I was able to guess whodunnit by the time I read 2 3 of the book  this novel held my interest  I enjoyed the plot and the characters  and the story and descriptions were well written and conversational  None of the characters were  intentionally  truly likeable  though  so it was hard to root for anyone  Rachel is  obviously  the most developed character  and I felt like I got to know her  even though I didn t like her for the stupid mistakes she kept on making in her life and then repeating them  Megan was probably the second most developed character and the one that I felt most connected to  She had this longing for  more  out of life that I think we all feel from time to time  even when we ve finally reached a place in our lives where things are comfortable  We should be happy  but we long for excitement  The other characters felt a bit generic  but that didn t detract from the story  All in all  this book is a clear winner and I m looking forward to the movie  Oh my god  Where do I start  the cliffhangers almost take the life out of me  Such an epic novel  This is my first psychological thriller  No wonder it is called  THE NEXT GONE GIRL   And the most surprising experience for me out of this book  I didn t fell in love with the characters  Not even a little bit  All I have done in my entire career as a bookaholic  LOVE THE PEOPLE  And yeah  I didn t like anyone in here  Rachel had her own mistakes  being an alcoholic and all  THOUGH I CAN RELATE WITH THE OBSESSION PART   Megan  well I COULDN T UNDERSTAND THAT GIRL   TWO TIMING  I mean one side she is with Tom  another time with Kamal  I TOTALLY AGREE WITH RACHEL ON THIS PART SHE WAS NOT JESS  not the beautiful  sweet girl who loved her husband  Totally not  ANNA AND TOM SERIOUSLY I HATED HATED HATED THEM One of he most chilling parts in the novel was when in the end Rachel kills Tom and Anna tries to confirm it by twisting the corkscrew that Rachel jabbed in tom s neck  I WAS SHAKING BY THAT TIME  While reading the book  I had only one question in my mind IF HE CAN LEAVE THE FIRST FOR THE SECOND  WHY CAN T HE NOT LEAVE THE SECOND FOR THE THIRD Well  all in all AN AMAZING READ   Que horror de libro  pero en el buen sentido  La primera mitad es horrible y claustrofobico  A partir de la segunda mitad me da la sensacion de que todo se complica demasiado y el final  aunque lo veia venir  reconozco que me ha pillado un poco desprevenida Lo mas curioso es que  cuanto mas leia  mas me daba cuenta de lo mal que me caian todos los personajes  no se salva ni uno  Y no digo mas por no spoilear    Trendeki Kiz kapagini ilk gordugumden andan itibaren

The chapters were paced well at the beginning but I m not sure if the story might have  jumped the shark  at the end or if it just was all about the shark the whole time   i enjoyed this book  but not as much as gone girl   i wish they wouldn t make such comparisons bc it makes it hard to read the book for itself and not be thinking constantly about the other book  i think i would ve enjoyed it a lot more if i hadn t been thinking abt gone girl the whole time  another book full of jacked up people   love it lol  Anelpista kalo ki eukolodiabasto  Den eikha kamia prosdokia otan to xekinesa alla

ligotero phluaro   Compelling story told in the voices of 3 women  Rachel  Anna  and Megan and one of them is dead  Creepy  sociopathic murder mystery as you begin to deduce what the three women have in common  Rachel is the primary voice  but is an unreliable narrator due to her excessive drinking and blacking out  Her life is a shambles after a nasty divorce and she rides the train daily past her old life and home  which now includes a new wife and child for her husband  She is obsessed with them in a very stalkerish way  fueled by alcohol  but she also develops an unhealthy occupation with another couple in the neighborhood whom she observes from the train  Jason and Jess as Rachel names them are a hip  young couple who appear very much in love  In reality  they are Scott and Megan and they have many secrets and a sense of impending doom  What Rachel witnesses  gets involved with  and can t remember reliably drives the story and makes it hard to put down  Great vacation read  The ending is a little implausible and I found the date sequencing a little confusing off putting  but I don t pay enough attention to numbers    so that s on me  Not as dark as Gone Girl  but not as masterfully written either  it s hard to give a regular review here  you d like this book if you like reading about flawed people and personalities  imperfect lives  mess ups  that sort of stuff  I do  so I finished the book in 3 days  the ending was a slight let down but overall  quite a page turner This was an exciting read which kept me guessing until the end  Rachel is a pitiful woman  30 years old  divorced and out of work due to drinking too much  She still takes the train into London each morning and home each evening  She watches her old house  where her ex still lives with his new wife and baby  and also the house four doors down  where an attractive young couple she calls Jess and Jason live  One day she sees Jess kissing a different man on her deck  and Jess  actually Megan  is declared missing a short time later  Rachel decides to get involved  She goes to the police to tell them about the other man  and calls Jason  actually Scott  to say she s a friend of Megan s  She quickly gets embroiled into intrigue with Scott and her ex and his new wife    La vida no es un parrafo y la muerte no es un parentesis  La chica del tren es un libro que me impresiono por sus personajes  que es su mayor atributo  estan muy bien construidos  las voces de las chicas son muy fuertes y aunque no logras conectar o querer a ninguna terminas conociendolas y no solo a ellas sino a quienes las rodean   y dentro de este punto es donde podemos encontrar una falla en el libro  porque al ser tan bien creada la psicologia de los personajes  excesivamente pronto sabes que paso y quien lo hizo  el porque se tarda un poco mas  pero poco a poco llegas a eso    Una por la pena  dos por la alegria  tres por una chica  cuatro por un chico  cinco por la plata  seis por el oro  siete por un secreto que jamas debe ser contado   Entre las muchas criticas que he leido el libro se menciona que la segunda mitad del libro es aburrida  que se va por las ramas  etc  y respecto a eso voy a decir que hay dos formas de ver este libro  una es como una ficcion cualquiera  y si lo ves asi puede que tengan razon  pero cuando te das cuenta que es una ficcion realista  la situacion  los personajes  la investigacion  todo eso son cosas que pasan y que puedes encontrar en fuera de esta historia  te das cuenta que esta muy bien trabajado  porque toda la trama sigue ese tono  en la vida real las cosas no pasan repentinamente sino que hay una cantidad de momentos que llevan a esa resolucion y muchas cosas no son lo que parece hasta que las miras con ojo critico  y eso es como ellas lo descubren  Si como lector lo supiste antes es solo porque tu no lo estas viviendo  sino que eres el expectador  Los giros en la trama no son dramatico pero fluyen y funcionan   No hay nada mas doloroso y corrosivo que la desconfianza  Es un libro que sin ser perfecto es muy bueno  un concepto bien explotado y que  aunque no te tiene agarrado de las unas  no aburre en ningun momento  Paula Hawkins hizo un muy trabajo para presentarse al mundo  ahora solo queda ver sus trabajos posteriores   Casi creo que hay un modo de dejar todo esto atras  pasar la pagina  volver a casa       y vivir mi vida como lo hace la gente normal  sin estarmirando todo el rato por encima del hombre ni esperar con todas mis fuerzas que llegue algo mejor  No es eso lo que hace la gente normal    Es mas bien un 4 5  Me gusto mucho el libro  tiene buen ritmo una trama muy interesante  Al final se hace imposible soltarlo y eso me encanto  No le pongo 5 por que pude intuir al asesino facilmente  aun asi hay sorpresas al final y eso fue divertido  En conclusion amo los thrillers  I devoured this book in three and a half hours  Many comparisons are made between this and Gone Girl  but for me the only similarity is the unreliable narrator as storyteller  The mystery in this book is slowly unraveled as the narrators share their snippets of what happened from their POV  As many people noted  it is easy to figure out whodunit before the big reveal  I think  however  that this is just a result of good storytelling  A lot of mystery readers enjoy the satisfaction of uncovering the mystery along with the narrator rather than being slapped with a crazy twist ending that comes from left field  There s nothing more frustrating to me than getting to the end and finding that the author left no clues that would have led me to reach that conclusion  so I like that she showed us little hints and clues along the way  Despite being able to figure out whodunit  I felt there were plenty of surprises along the way and the author has a way of ending chapters so that I simply couldn t stop reading   This came highly recommended by a Goodreads friend and  unusually for me  I ordered a copy from the library straight away  This was despite the fact that I couldn t manage to fit it into any of my current challenges either then or when it finally arrived  quite forgotten by then   However  it can cross an item off another old challenge  which is a good thing as I never quite finish most of them in the months provided and of course the old challenge lists continue to grow  Hmm  idea  Next year my first challenge can be to complete all the old challenges before I think of any brilliant new ones  as I will keep making my own challenges as well as doing the group ones that I enjoy so much  All of which has nothing whatsoever to do with this book  Except to say  that I m delighted that it managed to jump queue This book had me guessing all the way  The blurb  the two one paragraph pages at the start  and then the pile of clothes by the railway line     The unfolding of the character Rachel in her misery  the looks into the thoughts of Megan and Anna  with their own occasional chapters      The confusion  the despair  the gradual reconnection with lost moments     The one thing I didn t like is the jumps back in time  but this is a purely personal problem  They are perfectly well pointed out  with precise dates every time  and then Morning and Evening segments  which I rather liked   Unfortunately  I m bad at dates   e g  I ve only got four grandchildren and I can never remember two of their birth dates   and so my mind glosses over dates in books  I m also bad at reading chapter headings as I m in such a hurry reading the narrative  However  I understand the author s intent as it means she can write the preceding time segments still in the present tense and that makes the tension even more palpable  And the tension in this novel is excellent  A great read  Great suspense novel  Many twists and turns  If you liked Gone a Girl you ll like this  Wow  what a RIDE  This supremely crafted  twisting  turning  winding mystery thriller is a riveting journey that keeps you guessing from start to finish  The three audiobook narrators performed fantastically  normally I m not a fan of  view spoiler  unreliable narrators   hide spoiler   but this is the most well crafted usage I have ever experienced  Bravo P S There s no way this won t be made into a movie  Started slow  but picked up 1 3 of the way   compelling  despite the unlikeable characters  I was a bit disappointed with the end  but worth a read anyway  An intense psychological mystery  It was very well written although not entirely original  I have read many similar books that aren t as well known  It s definitely a page turner and kept me guessing right up to the end  The Girl on the Train is not my normal kind of read  I tend to avoid thrillers because of how utterly frustrated they make me  I either guess who the bad guy is way before I m supposed to or the characters do stupid things and I m left screaming in my head  Well   The Girl on the Train definitely did the latter  but I found myself desperate to hear every single word of this one The Girl on the Train takes unreliable narration seriously  giving us one point of view that leaves us constantly guessing while the other two play second fiddle and color our image with bias and extra information  I m not sure if I was meant to like any of the characters because I hated them all  but I was invested in their stories and the only time I took a break was to sleep or if a customer came in  Rachel is a desperate alcoholic who wants to move on from her ex husband but keeps spinning her wheels  Anna her ex husband s new wife  and Megan the woman who was murdered  All three of these points of view had me in turmoil  I m pretty sure I was growling at parts of it because they are three of the most frustrating individuals ever  but it s because of those strong feelings that I enjoyed it so much  This is a  whodunnit  with the emotions amped way up  and I felt just desperate as Rachel at times for the answers to who was responsible for the woman s death  The entire story takes a lot of time to piece together  and I warred with wanting Rachel to stay out it and wanting her to get involved more Any time a mystery book manages to keep my highly analytical brain churning and unable to decide just who it was that did the deed for at least the first 60  of the book I consider it a success  though it s rare    so for this book to completely through me for a loop until about 75 80  is just amazing  Kudos to you Ms  Hawkins  It might have been I was preoccupied with wanting to punch people for their lack of clear judgment  but who could really blame them   but I appreciate when a mystery actually remains a mystery The narrators were excellent and I quite liked their ability to put on new personas and give clear voice to other characters  Megan s voice  Louise Brealey  is my favorite personally because she sounds like Billie Piper and I could honest listen to that woman talk all day  If Louise Brealey may sound familiar and that s because she s Molly Hooper on BBC s Sherlock  The only narrator I had a problem with was Anna  and that s because she had a flat sort of voice   but honestly it worked well with the type of personality Anna has I quite like the style of this book and I can t wait until I get a chance to read more like it  namely Gone Girl  I ve heard it is an excellent read for those who are aching for a book with a slow forming plot and lots of emotional twisting  The story pulled me in immediately and I kept turning the pages because I had to know what happened  However  Rachel  the main character  was such a mess and each poor decision made me cringe  Even so  the narration pulled me in and I just couldn t stop reading it  The plot was creative and fast paced  Having said that  I also must say the characters were so flawed as to be nearly unlikable  it reminded me a lot of how I felt reading  Gone Girl    If you liked Gone Girl  you ll like this book too  It s a psychological thriller a la Alfred Hitchcock  Rachel  a sad  depressed alcoholic pines for her ex husband Tom  Tom had an affair that resulted in a pregnancy  He divorced Rachel  married the  other woman  and now all three  husband  wife and child  are living happily in the house that was once Rachel s  You heard me  IN THE HOUSE THAT WAS ONCE S RACHEL S  Twist the knife why don t you  The train to London takes Rachel past her old neighborhood  From the window of the train Rachel observes her former home but also the daily activities of another couple who are new to the neighborhood  Rachel is fascinated by the new couple  She imagines the fabulous life they live  Then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough  Next comes news that the neighbor has gone missing and her husband is a suspect in her disappearance  Rachel offers what she knows to the police  and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next  as well as in the lives of everyone involved  Has she done more harm than good  I m having a hard time deciding about this book  Over all I guess I liked it  I liked that I was always trying to figure out  who done it  and the book kept my interest that I had a hard time putting it down  What seemed to annoy me most was the characters  I know  the book wouldn t be the book without them  BUT  how messed up and dysfunctional ALL the characters were started to annoy me a little bit  Over all a good book though  This review and others can be found on Cozy Up With A Good ReadEvery day Rachel takes the same train into town and the same train back  and every day she stares at the houses that she passes and dreams about what is happening inside and what the people are like  Rachel has made a life for these people and then all of a sudden  the woman disappears  Rachel finds herself intrigued and needing to find out what truly happened to  Jess  Rachel begins getting deeper and deeper into the lives of this couple and through this investigation of a woman s disappearance  Rachel inevitably begins to confront her own life and the mistakes she has made  As you learn more about Rachel and her life  you wonder what is really happening  and readers are truly taken into a dark circle where you can t tell which way is up This is really one of those books that not much can truly be said about it  or else the entire story is given away  It is the book that readers really need to experience for themselves and then just pass on to others  it was a book that stayed up reading late into the night because I really wanted to find out not only what happened to Megan  but also what would happen to Rachel and the rest of the characters as the mystery continued to deepen I honestly was nervous about reading it because of all the hype this book has gotten  but I did really love the mystery Paula Hawkins gave me in this story  Worth the hype  This book oozes dread  I really enjoyed it because creating that sense of doom takes so much talent and it s thrilling to see it play out in this book I worried and ached for these characters  which made the horrible things so much more horrible  And they re challenging people  I m still confused about Anna Overall  perfect summer read  Hell  perfect anytime read if you love dark mysteries  Update  6 10 15The book will be adapted to a film  Emily Blunt might play the lead role  It will also double as a public service movie on the perils of alcoholism and voyeurism                                                                              There isn t an ounce of kindness in this book  it s all about horrible suburbanites being horrible to each other  which makes it a superb read  This is the first book I ve ever completed as an audiobook I feel that must mean something   Sou muito esquisita com os thrillers e policiais que leio porque cresci a ler Agatha Christie  Nao e do meu tempo mas o Poirot e uma personagem marcante da minha infancia porque devorei todos os livros que o meu pai tinha do detective belga  e eram todos  Quando a TOPSELLER me deu a oportunidade de ler  em primeira mao  um livro que se dizia ser muito bom eu nao recusei  Este livro esteve dezoito semanas no primeiro lugar da tabela de vendas do New York Times  Dezoito semanas  Nao e brincadeira nenhuma Li o em quatro dias  Um bocadinho todas as noites  Aguentei me para nao o ler todo de uma vez e para o fazer durar  Meus amigos e minhas amigas  o Gone Girl ao lado do A Rapariga no Comboio e brincadeira de criancas Depois de o ler estou aqui para vos convencer a meterem as maos neste livro IMEDIATAMENTE Este livro e inquietante e a melhor parte e que ninguem e de confianca  incluindo as tres vozes femininas que servem de narradoras desta historia Entre uma alcoolica  uma mentirosa e uma adultera em quem e que podes confiar  Estas sao as tres mulheres no centro do livro  Rachel  Anna e Megan Eu adoro de andar de comboio  prefiro ate a autocarros  e  como tal  estou sempre a olhar pela janela da carruagem para ver as vistas Com a Rachel nao e bem assim  Ela e a rapariga no comboio que para se esquecer da sua vida miseravel imagina como sera a vida das outras pessoas  Especialmente a vida da  Jess e do Jason  que moram na casa que fica em frente a janela da sua carruagem onde o comboio para no sinal vermelho todas as manhas Mas  certo dia  as coisas nao correm como esperado e a Rachel ve algo que destroi a imagem que ela tinha na sua cabeca da  Jess e do Jason  E agora ela encontra se no meio das suas vidas sem certezas do que sabe na verdade mas certa que nao pode descansar ate descobrir E interessante que a Rachel   que e  de certa forma a personagem principal   desafie os leitores a pensar em como nos assumimos muita coisa   e fazemos julgamentos   de outras pessoas baseado no nosso conhecimento limitado sobre elas  Sentir pena  nojo  frustracao  compaixao e todo um rol de sentimentos por um so personagem e uma coisa rara Todas as personagens deste livro sao terriveis e  como resultado  este livro e uma obra maravilhosa de estudo de caracter e desenvolvimento humano  Tambem esta muito bem escrito e e um thriller psicologico preciso e bem desenvolvido  Eu nao estava nada a espera daquele plot twist no final mas caracas  foi maravilhoso Este livro esta cheio de segredos  Toda a gente os tem  E sobre os pequenos misterios que existem por fora do que vemos a superficie  O que e que acontece atras de portas fechadas  Ate que ponto podemos conhecer uma pessoa  Que horrores existem na nossa memoria de Sabado a noite naquele ponto preto do qual nao de lembras A Rapariga no Comboio e fascinante  viciante e oh so very creepy  Este livro foi me enviado pela editora em troca de uma review honesta   I was addicted  I could not put the book down and I finished it in a weekend  but the crazy  plot twist  was not all that crazy  I figured it out pretty early on  and I was disappointed to find out I was correct  Although it s often compared to GONE GIRL  the shock I experienced while reading that book was just not there for THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN  However  the characters were fleshed out and multidimensional  I hated Rachel  Anna  and Megan through most of the story  Actually  there wasn t a single character I found likeable  but they were real and had redeeming qualities  I loved how Hawkins set the scene and used the train as the backdrop for most of the work  It was real and relatable  As someone who rides the train all the time  I know that there are loads of fascinating people that board  but I thought it unique that the author focused on people in the typically blurred landscape  I definitely recommend this novel for someone looking for a thrilling  fast paced read I  This got SOCLOSE to being a 5 star read for me    but I had guessed the killer less than halfway through the book  and I was disappointed that I was right  I wanted to be thrown for a loop  and that alone knocks it down to a 4 5 for me  Regardless  this was a supremely written book with an interesting point of view style  It is full of absolutely ghastly human beings  Normally  I have to like at least one character to enjoy the book because I need someone to cheer for  Everyone was unlikeable  They were a bunch of deeply flawed people who made some unforgivable errors in judgement but the author managed  shockingly  to create moments of empathy for all of them  I m not a fan of crime novels  but crime novels like this warm me to the idea  The tension building throughout was done exquisitely well  and made the book hard to walk away from  I said  oh SHIT   out loud more than once  The characters were written so authentically that it was easy to forget that the story was fiction  that the narrators were not writing accounts of their own experiences  The writing was meticulous  and the author captured such distinct personalities  I ve read some comparisons with Gone Girl  but I feel this was done much better   Rachel is living a lie  commuting by train every day to a nonexistent job so her flatmate won t know she s been fired  The train often stops in front of the home of   a perfect  golden couple  sitting on their rooftop terrace  One morning Rachel notices something shocking when the train makes its stop  The next day the perfect blond woman is reported missing The main characters are unreliable narrators  women with low self esteem  cheating spouses  and compulsive liars  Memories are just a little out of reach after heavy drinking  This psychological thriller has lots of twists and turns  and is a quick page turner  3 5 I expected more from this book  The ending was pretty predictable since the first start  though there were little twists here and there  But its worth to read   I can definitely see why many people liken this book to Gone Girl   lots of people who aren t very likable  I felt bad for Rachel  though  I really did   The characters were all miserably unlikable  but the plot was twisted enough to keep me going  Fun read  Do you want to know how much this kind of hype turns me off for choosing my reading material   If you liked Gone Girl    For fans of Gone Girl   and  This year s Gone Girl  is a sure fire bet I will want to avoid said book being compared to another one as intensely as this one is to Gone Girl  But The Girl on the Train was picked for our book club  meeting this evening   I read Gone Girl  it was okay  In fact  I think this was one in the rare case where the movie was far better than the book   Pardon me   but Rosamund Pike OWNED that role of Crazy Amy   It s also a crying shame that The Girl on the Train came out AFTER Gone Girl  Because TGOTT is far better  Yes  there are certainly comparisons to GG with its unreliable characters   but I was thinking more of Hitchcock s  Rear Window  while reading  TGOTT is clever  and despite a little bit of a rocky start   it was a little confusing to settle into at the start   I settled in and found I couldn t stop reading  4 5 stars   I think it s hard to not have really high expectations once a book reaches  Costco level   Meaning that by the time The DaVinci Code or any Oprah Book Club book reaches such a wide distribution  you maybe expect more than you should  Case in point  The Girl on the Train is a pretty good book  It s a first person narrative which I was a bit uncomfortable with when reading from an alcoholic s POV  It had a pretty good ending as well  but the main characters were hard to empathize with  making it a longer feeling read  if that makes sense   I ll say  not bad   I got an ARC through NetGalley  in exchange for an honest review  3 5 to 4 stars  Perhaps not the most original thriller ever for someone who s read a lot of such books already  but for me  since I seldom read that genre  it was an interesting story  Guessing who the culprit is turned out to be relatively easy  but this book is of the kind where the whodunnit doesn t really matter  it s how it happened  how and why the person got there  that is the most important part  The fact that the narrators are all more or less unreliable  especially Rachel  also add to the confusion  in a good way The story is told in first person  from three women s points of view  and each of those give a different insight and different sorts of tidbits  allowing to piece things together gradually  They re all flawed protagonists in their own ways  and this can be seen as either annoying or fascinating  depending on where you stand on the matter  Sometimes  they seemed pretty weak and clingy  as in  being unhappy about their lives but not exactly doing much to change things   on the other hand  I guess we all know that big changes in general aren t so easy to enact as it sounds  and so those protagonists are both relatable and slightly grating  because they might force us to face some problems of our own   Had I read this book during another period in my life  I might have been uneasy  feeling like I was confronted with things I should be doing  but wasn t  Whether one ends up liking or disliking the protagonists doesn t really matter  because it s clear they aren t meant to be a hundred percent likeable  and that their roles are never all black or all white  Rachel s alcohol problem and disturbing voyeuristic side  watching people from the train  imagining what their lives may be  then wanting to make her own place in those lives      Anna who acts all righteous but who still was the proverbial bull in a chine shop   Jess  whose boredom is understandable  but who also twists truths in her own narrative   Jason  who may not be such the perfect husband  And so on I would probably not call this book  the next Gone Girl   though    but then  I don t like comparing novels in general in such a way  This one stands on its own  Feb  19 2015  This book made me finally get out of my reading slump so I am already appreciative about that It is quite confusing for me  I wish that in the kindle version they had not just added the names next to the chapters  but also the dates  It would have made it so much more easy for me  After a while I just had to let it go  By it I mean trying to make sense of the story before I should make sense of it    Update  Finished this morning and checked on my kindle to see what others thought of the book  amazon  Wow I was surprised of the many many negative reviews and most did not like it because they did not like the characters I quess I am different because I do not like characters that are perfect and like them with flaws although not those that keep repeating the same mistake So far I liked   and did not like although I did see the reason others did like  They are all 3 thrillers I ve read over the last few months This book by Paula Hawkins is a perfect book to read when you are in a reading slump because the chapters are mostly build in 2 or 3 part  Morning  and evening of one day and then divided over 3 women and that is what I love so yes this was a good read for me Now the big question is  What to read next  Help Me  If you know a good thriller or a book about various women please help me  My friend Lee at work gave this book to me and mentioned that he liked it  He knows I m addicted to reading  And I love to be introduced to new books   As for  The girl on the train  I liked it   however I was annoyed and pissed off at all the characters 99  of the time  Rachel would piss me off  make me pity her and like her but still feel sorry for her at the same time  She is broken  weak and lost  Now Megan  I couldn t stand her  losing Libby was awful  my heart ached for her  I felt sorry for her but I don t get why she is the way she is  She disgusted me  Anna  narcissistic dumb b       Now the men in this book  Ugh don t get me started  As for giving the novel only four stars that s because the ending was predictable and flat  I was looking for the  wow factor   This book is believable but I wanted more  But all in all it was good  Read it  I just wish the author gave more about Rachel  For example Rachel quit drinking  got help for her dependency on  men  and why she s the way she is problem   I wanted to see a big change for her not a now I m curious about Anna unless the author is going to make a series out of this because of the ending  Then again that would be predictable now too  It s a good novel  worthy of a mystery on  The Lifetime  network  You know the one issue   every woman has a bad man issue s with a crazy woman or a bad momma  I can t see a movie coming out of this   Okay  I need to stop because this is sounding more like a bad review and it s not how I feel  I like how the author made the  drunk   assumed crazy lady the good gal or right gal  However  Tom wasn t seen for what he really was which left me hanging  I kind of wanted to something else from Anna and Scott  Okay  still sounds like a bad review lol  Good points  The woman and their messed up personalities revolving around MEN   There are problem ladies MEN  Lol just joking  However the book does make you think about why we as women put up with so much  change ourselves and let a bad relationship change us or why we put so much validation on ourselves because of men  Anna s no man would choose that over me  sorry chica but a hard      has no conscience  And yet her arrogant  narcissistic ways clouded what was really what  Tim was a man who wanted his cake  pie  pudding and eat it too   I like the book because I like seeing the crazy a   b       in my mind and thinking    thank God I m not that stupid  naive or have fallen so low   You first see it as a tragic love story and a wounded heart  is she nuts  Then omg she was just abused to the point if a breakdown  Lesson learned  love may be blind but damn why the stupidity  All the females in this novel were weak  The characters are very believable   People compare this book to Gone Girl  not a favorite of mine   but something grabbed me in this one in a way that Gone Girl did not  I actually read the whole book in a day  And I liked it  Ish  Meaning I noticed some of the flaws    kind of flat  unlikeable characters  multiple narrators with indistinguishable voices  women characters who seem weak and or completely define themselves by the men in their lives    but still  I read and engaged and enjoyed the story  It won t be winning any fine fiction awards  but for a quick summer read  The Girl on the Train delivers  Solid 3 5 stars  vanmorgen begonnen in bed aan dit boek  ben benieuwd na al de positieve commentaren dat ik eerder van dit boek las   ik lees dit wel als ebook dus vooruitgang met bladzijden zal er niet komen   wachten tot het einde voor de beoordeling     I m still uncertain how I feel about this book  Told through the POV of three women involved in vastly different ways to a disappearance  the overall tone is just depressing  Primarily  we read through the lens of Rachel  a woman who has devolved into a drunk  who thinks she saw something important in relation to the disappearance  She comes off so broken that it is difficult to continuing reading  She is obsessed with her ex husband and we frequently start her sections off with her trying to piece together what terrible thing she did the night before while drunk  We also have Anna  Rachel s ex husband s new wife  and Megan  the disappeared woman  although her story is told from an earlier time period   There are so many cringe worthy moments as Rachel becomes more and more obsessed with Megan s disappearance  But this isn t a straight forward mystery  While there is a thriller component  what has stuck with me is the inner lives of these women and how much we all carry inside  Hawkins does a great job of contrasting how this internal pain might stay contained or might leak over into lives   4 5 estrelas Yes  I love being right   And this book was so good  I flew through it  It was definitely different from what I expected  in the way it was told and written  but I thought it was great for the story  An awesome debut   There s lot of buzz going around about THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN  and for the most part  I think it lived up to the hype  It s a dark psychological thriller that was easy to get wrapped up in  Rachel  a k a the girl on the train  likes to snoop on people s lives outside the window as she rides back and forth to London  which gets her in a web of trouble when she sees something disturbing  Rachel is unstable  and her life is a mess  so can her story be believed  The doubts I had about Rachel made this an entertaining story to read  I love unreliable narrators    fun and frustrating If I compare this book to that other  girl  thriller  GONE GIRL   it falls a bit short  THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN had plenty of interesting twists and big reveals along the way  though I wasn t that surprised by the ending  I also thought that the women in this book were just too weak in character  as in a wee bit pathetic  Overall  I did enjoy the book though   Kept me reading late into the night    Impressive debut  and I ll definitely pick up Paula Hawkins next novel  4 stars  Most people compare The Girl on the Train to Gone Girl  but apart from the word  Girl  in the title and the fact that both novels are mysteries told  partially  from the point of view of unreliable narrators  they don t have all that much in common  Gone Girl is indeed a thriller and the twist of the story is totally unexpected  The Girl on the Train  on the other hand  is closer to a traditional mystery  Despite the fact that Gone Girl packed more of a punch and was more unexpected  I found that I enjoyed The Girl on the Train more  It could be the fact that  in the end  I could empathize with at least some of the characters  A female unreliable narrator  No  it s not Gone Girl  Rachel takes the commuter train into London and back everyday  and makes up stories about the people who live in the houses she passes  When she witnesses something at one of these houses  she begins to leave the train and interfere in the neighborhood and with the people who live there  I won t give away any more than that  I liked the book  liked being along for the ride with Rachel  and recommend it   This is a really juicy novel about deliriously bad people  Fun  creepy  enjoyable and although you do see the ending coming I was still biting my fingernails  the tension is wrought and drove me to finishing this novel in two sittings  Wonderful  Read this book in as few of sittings as possible and pay attention to the details  She does a really great job of teasing the story along through a choppy chronology and three points of view  I loved riding this train  Good read with a few twists 3 5 stars  I had to add the  5 because this was definitely an enjoyable read  I actually really liked the way the story was written  I also wasn t too hung up on the way that the characters were written  Just because I didn t like any of them  doesn t mean that I couldn t enjoy the read  I guessed the ending pretty early in  but I was still interested enough to finish the book in one sitting  I m guessing the writing kept me reading   or maybe it was the curiosity of wanting to know exactly how this mess ended With that being said   I couldn t give a higher rating because I hated ALL of the characters  They were all horrible people  The women were sad excuses for human beings  I couldn t identity with any of them  The men were just frightening  to be frank  I don t think that I ve read any novel in which I was unable to find one redeeming quality in a single character  The writing and story had to exceptional because if not  I could would not have finished this story  The story of the book is described by three different characters in three different ways  As you turn each page with more and more curiosity  you never know what it s going to happen till the end of the book  The fact that the story is described at the first person singular  it makes it more personal  The overall style of writing is very catchy and keeps your interest until the end   Mia gunaika pegainoerkhetai me to treno kathe mera  ten idia diadrome  Ti pio sunethismeno   Paraterei ena spiti kai

This book was very good   I wanted to know what happened so badly   I read a lot of thriller in my life and this one is different from all the others  because of the way the story is narrated   The Girl on the Train has a lot of hype and is frequently lumped with Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn  as if all of us readers are constantly searching for the next similar book   a suspense that isn t quite a crime drama and run of the mill mystery    for good reason  The Girl on the Train deserves every bit of that hype and is lumped accordingly with Gone Girl because it s similar  it gives readers the twist and fucked up ness that we are so desperately searching for after experiencing Gillian Flynn s books  I loved The Girl on the Train  It was twisted  confusing  and messed up  I expected an outsider to notice the couple on the deck from the train  but I never expected her life to intertwine with theirs the way that it did  I never expected Rachel to have such problems  either   I enjoyed every bit of the new and unexpected details that came flooding in when I began the book  My favorite part about the novel is kind of why some people dislike it  and Gillian Flynn s books as well   There are no likeable characters  As much as you want to sympathize with Rachel  you can t  You dislike everyone  including the couple on their deck  Everyone is terrible  selfish  and full of twists  secrets  and issues  But I love that because it s so rare in fiction and it s so common in real life  Why should there be a hero  Why can t characters have issues that make them unlikable  Why should that impact my ability to enjoy the story  I ll never understand readers who always want likeable people and likeable events in their books  I think it s interesting to get a glimpse of people and their situations and not be moved to sympathize with them  The Girl on the Train has a synopsis that works and is spot on  but just goes to show you that not everything is what it seems  It was great and I m glad I read it  It deserves the hype  but I think a lot of readers will dislike it because it features such unlikable characters and it is much more predictable  After all  we were looking for a Gone Girl twist and I think it s easier to find one when you are looking for it  I highly recommend the book  but if you re reading it just because it s what people are talking about  I suggest waiting until the mood truly strikes you so that it isn t a chore and so that it doesn t fall short of your expectations Love Literature Art and Reason Review Not great literature  but certainly a good read  The last 100 pages were great  You know  I really liked this  The women are all kind of terrible  but in different and relatable ways  I liked that the author didn t make them suddenly become better than they were laid out to be  you know  Especially Rachel I often wanted to shake  but I think it s a good sign when you feel frustrated by a character s limitations   you re involved in the story  right  I didn t find the end as uneven as some people did   maybe because I was anticipating the twist  because of the inevitable Gone Girl comparison  And I guess that the comparison is indeed fair enough  even beyond the bookclub phenomenon thing  However  I thought that this one felt more grounded  Maybe less crazy exciting  but more believable  too  I mean  I wouldn t go to the mat defending every choice the author made  but I found this to be a very engrossing  frothy thriller  Would recommend  This book is wildly popular right now  It won this year s Goodread award for Mystery   Thriller  and I understand a movie is due out later this year based on the book  It s about a woman down on her luck who rides a train to London to pretend she has a job  Every day  she sees the same couple in their home from her seat on the train  and she invents a perfect life for this couple  until the day  from the train  she sees the perfect woman kiss a stranger  The perfect woman then ends up missing  presumed murdered  Before I say what I didn t like  I ll tell you that the ending is very satisfying and made what I didn t like worth wading through  However  for me  there was a little too much relationship back and forth to story telling ratio  It s like horror books that have too much gore to story ratio at times  this book had too much worrying about who still loves whom or hates the other  for my tastes   Still  it s a must read  Medium sized book at 325 pages  Read it before the movie is my recommendation   I actually like it better than Gone Girl  It s not as cleanly written nor was twisty but the suspense is there  Worth a read  nice and easy but don t expect to be throttled  But it s fascinating enough and well constructed to keep you reading and wanting to know what happened  It gets brownie points for being distinctly British as well  And I enjoyed how it dealt with the reality of contemporary life  Addition  depression  vanity  egotism and so forth  The portraits were viciously honest  No one is perfect and everyone hides something    Oh boy  I am not normally a reader of thrillers but I sure am glad I listened to the Bestseller s List and picked this one up  This book grabs you and doesn t let you go until the fianl page  I was totally caught up in the lives of these characters  Rachel is an out of work alcoholic prone to blackouts  This causes a problem when she feels she may have witnssed something that could shed light on a murder  but can not remember it  She is still hung up on her ex husband who cheated on her  She rides the train every day into London to her fictional job that she lost months ago to fool her roomate into believing she s still working  She sees the same couple on the route the train takes every day and begins to create a story in her head about their perfect life and love  so diffeernt from her own  Then she sees something unexpected on her morning commute and it pulls her into the mystery  So good   Gone Girl crossed w Liane Morniarty  Couldn t put it down  I would 100  recommend this book to all of my pals  It was an interesting  albeit predictable  thriller  The premise is super intriguing  The whole book takes place in segments of morning and evening to coincide with the passing of the train  This book is not a work of literary genius  and it does feel like certain phrases are repeated again and again  however  it is a very good piece of filler fiction  I was entertained the entire time and could not wait until my next chance to read  This is an Anna  Amy  Stonefire Office Bookclub book for sure  I read this novel shortly after reading Gone Girl  The premise of the story was fascinating  On her morning commute  a woman begins to focus on the residents of a townhouse  Over the course of time she creates a life for them in her head  and one day she determines that something has gone awry  This leads to a whole series of decisions on her part that make up a wild ride I did think it went a bit over the top  While I enjoyed the story  it was all just a bit too dark  WOW  What a crazy  twisty turn of a story  When I began reading  I found it sad and confusing  The three points of view were somewhat odd and disjointed to follow along with  As the story progressed  I suddenly found myself drawn in to the plot and wondering what would happen next  I couldn t really feel for Rachel until the end   she was so damn self destructive  Once you figure everything out though  it really makes you wonder about people and their personal demons  I did enjoy the way all three character stories were intertwined together  but I have to admit that there were a few moments when I wondered if it was all one person writing from multiple personalities  I HATED Gone Girl so this comparison wasn t even close   I need 4 5 stars It is definitely tough to talk about this one without giving spoilers  The characters are all pretty unlikeable in general  but I think the author nicely pulls off the trick of developing them more as the story goes along so your opinion of them changes  I came to rather like Rachel towards the end This book does start off pretty slowly  And I was less than impressed with the  shocking  thing Rachel saw on the train  I was expecting more of that moment   even though it develops into more  Once this book picked up steam  I was hooked and cursing the fact that my drive time ended and I had to pause  I didn t guess the mystery ahead of time so that was good too  I hate it when I see where things are going before you get there As far as the audiobook  the voice actress who read for Rachel was great  Her male voices were really good too   some readers  both male and female  really falter here and it can make for a horribly distracting listen  The other two narrators were alright   or maybe it was that their characters were annoying so I found their voices irritating as well  Great page turner  Intricately woven stories of two women whose paths creepily cross  Definitely threw some twists in there  I really enjoyed this book  I was in the middle of another book  but a review from a friend made me want to look at it to see if I wanted to add it to my  to read  list  Well  that didn t happen  I read the first few pages and was hooked  the other book forgotten This book  a psychological thriller  grabs you from the first few pages and doesn t let go till the exciting end  The characters are wildly erratic  making who did what a total guessing game  Some are comparing this book To  Gone Girl    I disagree with them  This storyline has a more viable ending  which is much more satisfying   Gone Girl  ended suddenly  leaving the readers disappointed  This book does not do that  and is thrilling to the very end I look forward to the next book from this author  Highly recommended  As you can imagine  it s hard to give a proper review of a book with major plot twists  BUT I will say  that this book explores the psyches of three women  Being inside three women s heads can get a bit tedious  but most of the time you just can t believe what s happening The story keeps unraveling and unraveling  taking advantage of every detail given or not given  It s a crazy ride  I listened to the entire book in about a day That s all very vague  but if I give you ANY spoilers  it will ruin the book  So just take my word for it  If you like thrillers  this book is pretty awesome  First of all  I want to say  as far as crime thrillers go  it ticked all the boxes  I was completely in the dark as to the identity of the killer until very late in the book  and for a while it seemed like it could be literally anyone   including the narrator herself  I did have some minor issues with it   firstly  everyone in this book is pretty much an awful person  The alcoholic  stalker y narrator is the most likeable character  Also Cathy  She was kind of written as annoying and meddling but I feel like she was the only normal person in the whole story  Also  the way Scott wasn t at all punished for his emotional and physical abuse   with Rachel even apologizing to him at the end  though for what I m not entirely sure   doesn t sit well with me  With that being said  I still enjoyed the book and read it in one sitting  The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a good psychological thriller mystery that keeps you guessing  The story unfolds through the eyes of three first person narrators  all female  all unreliable  The main character  the girl on the train  is Rachel  a sad  desperate  alcoholic  whose life is spinning out of control  She watches the lives of strangers from the window of her commuter train and imagines that they are living the wonderful lives that she cannot  A quote from Rachel   Hollowness  that I understand  I m starting to believe that there isn t anything you can do to fix it  That s what I ve taken from the therapy sessions  the holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mold yourself through the gaps  Meanwhile  through the narration of the other two women we learn that their lives are very different from the ones imagined by Rachel  One of the narrators goes missing and we begin the mystery of whether foul play was involved  and if so  who is the culprit  This book is  inevitably  compared to Gone Girl  and the comparison is valid  I liked The Girl on The Train quite a bit better  I felt that The Girl on the Train delivered on its early promise  and I felt engaged in the story right up to the end  I give the book 4 stars  My only real complaint is that I didn t like a single character in the book  At times I felt sympathetic toward each of them  at other times frustrated and annoyed  Still  I recommend this book  Yay  finally  My aunt finished it and is lending it to me      I was gripped  I love Hitchcock and this was Hitchcockian in its slow unfolding  And the first person narration worked really well  I give it 4 stars only because I m trying to reserve 5 stars for Anna Karenina and the like   For the first third of this book  I was on the edge of my seat  The story flips back and forth between the perspective of the three main woman characters  Rachel  Anna    Megan and through their stories you are able to add another puzzle piece to the whole big mystery  This aspect keeps you on the edge of your seat for a long time until enough of the pieces are available and the big picture is revealed to you   which is great  Except that the mystery was not very original to me  So that s why I m giving it 4 stars  great job at keeping me on the edge of my seat  a lot of suspense in how the ending would wrap up  however  those last few puzzle pieces were an expected outcome  4 starsWell then  that was an interesting ride  Rachel is just a girl on the train  who s created a fantasy world around the couple living fours doors down from her old house  Jess and Jason are the perfect couple  just what she and her ex used to be  But one day  Rachel sees something happen between Jess and someone she doesn t know  When Jess goes missing  Rachel feels she has to offer up her information  and ends up getting deeply involved in the following investigation  I m pretty sure this can be compared with  Gone Girl   but since I gave up on that one after about 70 pages  I m not entirely sure  I do have to say that when I compare what I managed to read with this  I found this a much better story  not a big fan of drama for drama s sake   With that said  there is quite a bit of that in this story  narrated in first person  by three different women  Rachel is an alcoholic who can t get over her ex husband Tom  She consistently complains about making terrible decisions while drunk  but can t seem to stop drinking  I found myself wanting to throttle her sometimes  Anna is Tom s ex wife  happy to flaunt that he chose her  but terrified at the sight of Rachel  Anna can t do enough to get rid of her  a pot stirrer  that one  And then there s Megan  Sweet  little Megan who wasn t quite as wholesome as Rachel believed her to be  I figured out a major part of the plot about 1 3 of the way through  but the author did have me questioning myself later  so it s wasn t too bad  I wasn t a huge fan of the coarse language or the many mentions of sex  but it s a secular novel  so it s to be expected  Overall  a pretty interesting read  Thrilling and unputdownable   This was strange in the beginning  but once it got going I could not put it down  Very good  Whew    Well  I finally found that I had time to finish Paula Hawkins  thriller The Girl on the Train  although it wasn t for lack of interest  This is an absolute page turner and a tightly written thriller  The novel also has a wonderfully complex  emotional cast of characters that brings the story to life in a painfully human way  My only criticisms would be that Hawkins  characters were not fully developed  in the sense that their potential to be powerful  resilient women was not realized as fully as I thought it could have been  The protagonists  reactions to their situations were realistic  but I want bad ass folks in my fiction reading  I also found the ending to be somewhat predictable    I guessed the killer about two thirds of the way through  although there was a minor twist at the very end that surprised me  Overall  a very good  diverting read  I ve actually already loaned it to a friend  More 3 5 stars   I didn t like the main character  but was compelled to keep reading  Not really sure how I feel about the ending    Worth a read  though  One hell of an adrenaline rush  although it s fairly easy to solve the mystery about halfway through  One of those books where every single character is contemptible  and not just because they all use the word  quieten   way too much   And apparently this is a real word  It sounds made up to me  but evidently it s just a Britishism  One I sincerely hope never catches on around here  I listened to this audiobook while I was literally a girl on a train traveling through Europe  I started it on a train ride from London to Edinburgh  and since the book is set in England I recognized some of the city names which made it feel even more appropriate a choice for my train ride   o This is yet another book that s been compared to Gone Girl and of all the books in that category  this felt the closest to fitting that description  It s filled with unlikable characters who still nevertheless draw you into the story and there s a twist The book starts off a bit slow and it took me a while to get interested in Rachel s story  She came off to me as weak and depressed and also made questionable actions where I kind of wanted to smack her upside the head  But I also felt sorry for her and did sympathize with her after a while  Megan wasn t drawn much more likable but she was a lot easier to sympathize with because of all the things she had gone through in her life  The third narrator  Anna  doesn t get her POV introduced until much later in the book and she was my least favorite because she was so self centered and I also didn t like her voice much in the audiobook  The other two women I thought did a better job and had voices that better matched their characters The narrators are a bit unreliable which I don t necessarily mind since I think it can add to the story  but in this case it also made the twist seemingly come out of left field  although it still made sense  Overall it was an interesting book and pretty well done with the different narrators but not one that left me with a desire to rave about it to friends after I finished it  I was annoyed a the blurb about this book someone quoting Hitchcock   Um I don t think so  It took me a while to really get into this book  because the tooing and froing on the monotonous train journey  Although  of course this was setting the scene for the drama that was unfolding VERY SLOWLY    I m sure we have all looked at the houses and gardens we pass on the train and wondered about who lives there  This particular train stopped at the Halt signal  the house   garden visibly seen from the train Although when the story got going it definitely got my attention and romped away   I was gripped   a real page turner The story is told from 3 perspectives 3 quite different women with their own secrets and past fears   longings  Rachel  Tom s ex wife  Anna  Tom s present wife   Megan the neighbours wife  Intertwining stories  Lies and Secrets  Believable character analysis  however Rachel and Anna have never met Tom s family or friends I think this was rather an unbelievable naivety on the part of these two women  Would that happen in real life  I would be interested to read more fiction from this Author  The reason why I m rating this as a 4 is because it didn t quite live up to my expectations  Given that it has mostly been marketed as the next Gone Girl  there was too much hype that it was almost impossible that the book could live up to it I really hate this about myself but halfway through the book  I already made up my mind about whodunnit and I was right  I think watching too much whodunnit shows took its toll on me  But prior to figuring it out  I really liked that there was a point that everyone was a suspect  I couldn t trust anyone  I honestly kept hoping that I was wrong just to enjoy the  twist  more But this doesn t mean I didn t enjoy reading the novel because I did  It was compelling despite knowing what s going to happen next  I highly enjoyed this quick read about the dark parts of the human psyche and was left wanting more If you liked Gone Girl  then odds are you ll enjoy this one too  Not quite as much  but close enough  It surely was a page turner  or to be precise  a blindfolder  if that term exist   because when I was listening to this captivating and so well descriptive story when walking to the supermarket  I got so engrossed   that I actually neverarrived at the store  It was only when I saw some teens vandalising a bus shelter and they interrupted my fictional world that I realised I was lost  I literally didnt have a clue where I was at first  Kind of similar to Rachel in the book  Well written really liked the author used the three female narrators to fill in the story  I also liked how it jumped back in forth in time  This type is not my usual read  but the comparison to Gone Girl and Rear Window sold me on it  The best way to sum this up is to trust no one  the characters are all deeply flawed people with serious problems which makes for a great summer read   Enjoyed Hard to put down  Loved and empathized with all the female main characters and liked how their connection unfolded at end   A solid 3 5 stars  I had heard this book was amazing and about the big twist  so I was expecting one  a la Gone Girl  But the twist wasn t so much a twist  not exactly  The Girl on the Train is a thriller and I enjoyed it  Nicely done  and I ll definitely pick up the next novel by Paula Hawkins   I decided that 2015 would be the year that I read what I want when I want  and not just read particular books because I feel like I  should   It s early in the year  and I ve already strayed from my intention with various results   Sorry  but I wasn t interested enough to finish Emily St  John Mandel s Station Eleven   But I m so glad I decided to try Paula Hawkins s The Girl on the Train The comparisons to Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl are inevitable   Girl  in the title  unreliable narrator  crime from the POV of someone who s NOT a professional investigator   unlikeable  female lead character    But I warmed to The Girl on the Train much more  Often times I struggled with Rachel Watson due to her alcoholism  but she really does try to do the right thing  though often for the wrong reasons Paula Hawkins has crafted an intoxicating story with flawed yet familiar characters and page turning twists  The Girl on the Train is an international best seller for a reason  it s bloody good  and should appeal to fans of Brit crime  An intriguing read that s left me impatient for news about the author s next novel  What can I say that hasn t already been said about this book  It s pretty freaking awesome and definitely worth a read Told from the point of view of three different women  the narrative jumps around not only from person to person but in chronology as well  As their stories continue  we realize that something horrible lead up to a death and that none of the narrators could be describe as reliable    I struggled with the rating but decided on 4 stars because I thought Ms Hawkins did a good job in expressing feelings  sights  and sounds  I did think she went overboard with Rachel s pathetic character  I couldn t relate to her but was rooting for her in the end  The story did keep my interest and overall I enjoyed this novel   As far as thrillers go  it really was quite a ride to read this book  I couldn t put it down  I like how it s written and the women in this book are all complex and problematic whilst keeping everything mysteriously relatable  I really enjoyed this book  It was a page turner  Each character was developed and explored  Secrets poured out on each of them until the very end of the book  It was definitely a good whodunit  I was a little disappointed that I knew who did it earlier than I wanted to  I realized though that it was revealed in perfect time  because there was more to be shared and shown once we knew  I particularly enjoyed that the character development included other people s perception of the character  The author did a great job of layering the character development with objective study of the character  I enjoyed the way the book was written in each woman s voice  I thought the voyeuristic quality of the storytelling to be brilliant  People watching is a timeless favorite  We love to imagine the lives and nuances of people we see  but do not really know  This book has been compared to Gone Girl and I do not agree  They both are similar in their twists and turns and reveals  But   Girl on a Train  has a storytelling style all its own   This novel was a pleasant surprise and you need to read it right now  Don t read any reviews  just read it  Told in the voice of 3 female narrators   none are to be trusted  How easy it is to get caught up in the lives of people you only see as you sit on a passing train  that is exactly what happened to Rachel and it got her into some hot water and making her very unreliable  A story filled with secrets and full of grittiness  Amazing character development and very well written  it wasn t hard to figure lout who the culprit was early on  but that didn t deter me from wanting to know what happened along the way while still holding my interest the entire time I devoured this novel   and that doesn t happen very often  I loved the thrill  I loved the mystery  Would I compare it to Gone Girl  I don t think you really can  There is no book that stands up against Gone Girl  I LOVED Gone Girl and I really really liked The Girl on the Train  Paula Hawkins has instantly become an author I will be keeping my eye on  What you see on the outside is rarely what it is on the inside  Told from three different women s perspectives  we learn about a crime that everyone had motive to commitAlthough I guessed the baddie halfway through I still enjoyed seeing all the pieces come together   going though it with Rachel as she fought through the fog  Everyone in this book is messed up but they ring true to real life more than the other  Girl  book  My favourite character was Rachel   I could feel her pain and betrayal and how wretched she felt having her life turned upside by another persons selfish behaviour  including her own  Her drinking made me mad at times but I understood the why of it  I recommend this to anyone looking for a fast paced escape with twist   turns   drama thriller yang di UK dan USA sudah terjual jutaan eksemplar ini mengisahkan seorang pecandu alkohol bernama rachel  dia menjadi

untuk dibaca setiap perempuan   Quick and very dirtyAn honest to goodness mystery told quickly and well  Very enjoyable for this old mystery aficionado  I ll be looking forward to a next one  In general  this was a very good book and would recommend it for a quick read I m just not sure how much I enjoyed the ending because it happened so quickly and I wish there was more development  Like a British Gone Girl  the women in this story are real and flawed  the men are untrustworthy and the memory loss trope is made acceptable as this slow burning mystery unravels around the protag  who is a struggling alcoholic  Take away lessons  adultery is bad   and hell has no fury like a woman scorned   This was a great book to read in short spurts  Based on friends reviews I wasn t sure how I would feel but it kept me guessing and wasn t too predictable even when I figured out who the killer was  The one thing that almost turned me off though was Rachel s drinking problem  sometimes it disgusted me and other times I felt so sorry for her I think the way in which I read it was what kept it interesting though  if I was able to focus and read in long sessions I think it might have eliminated some of the intrigue  muy buen libro para evadirse un rato  super entretenido  El final no se ve venir Five word review  Amnesia thriller  Everyone has problems  Guys I finished this book two days ago and then just couldn t review it    fffffff wow  So nice to pick something up that isn t like anything else I ve read  Loved the characters  loved all the points of view  the timing  everything  YES  Lovely Lovely Lovely  I want to travel to London now    Started watching people more after this  such an interesting read  Finished this book in two days flat  Have come across a gripping thriller after quite some time  A page turner for sure  But the book s narration was quite similar to Gone Girl  and of course the name   I wouldn t want to read this kind of genre again as it just leaves you rattled as you become obsessed with the twisted characters  A top notch thriller but unsettling for some     I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts  Who was it said that following your heart is a good thing  It is pure egotism  a selfishness to conquer all   This is really a hard to tell story  I m a bit afraid to have my words about it because I might be judgmental  It s not a story that I would want to blab about too  It s just  it has so many terrible and horrible stuffs that I wouldn t want to remember  I leave you the freedom to choose whether to read it or not  Well  I don t really have much of a choice  do I How the story affected me First  it ruined my plan of going on a romantic train ride  Uggh  Now  I ll be remembering this story whenever I m on a train  Maybe I ll be even imagining things like that blue dress Rachel saw on the train  Maybe I ll even try to make up stories on people who live near the railways  Or worst  I won t even look out the train window  And who s fault it is  Damn me  I shouldn t have read it in the first place if I m going to act this way  I m solely to blame  But you can t really blame me  It s a mind trapping piece  You ll be glued to the mystery part of it immediately  Really  Yes  just because I was  Kidding   DDSecond  it totally ruined my wishful thinking of a HEA married life  It gave me the creeps  Nowadays  stories of unfaithful relationships are trendy  But this one so far is like the worst kind of it  You know  What if I fell inlove with a natural liar like him  or worse  I become one like her  No  I can t be  I ll end up having the  Unfaithful  song by Rihanna as my themesong  yeah  this is my greatest problem   And I m now literally thinking of  BAD BLOOD  by Taylor Swift as the story s OST  How s that   Did you have to do this  I was thinking that you could be trustedDid you have to ruin what was shiny  Now it s all rustedDid you have to hit me  where I m weak  Baby  I couldn t breatheAnd rub it in so deep  salt in the wound like you re laughing right at me Well  the lives of the characters in this story suck which makes the story terrible and horrible but on the contrary  the whole point of the story is good  It opens us to the idea of being careful with our decisions in life  to whom we entrust ourselves  and to really get to know the people that surrounds us  Because  we don t know or it might be too late for us to know that the person whom we love the most  or whom we thought loves us the most is actually the one who ll put us to danger  So don t just believe anyone  Another thing I like about the story is the way it depicted how Alcoholism leads to terrible  terrible things  So let s not engage to the habit of drinking to the fullest and heaviest  Okay  Yes Rating  4 terrible stars Yes  the story it told was terrible but it s still mind trapping  mind blowing  mind boggling and mind nevermind  In short  it s a terrible but good story   I saw a review that stated this novel was full of nothing but terrible people  but went on to say that it was great literature   I would disagree on the first point  I would say it s full of morally complex people  That s what makes this book so gripping and continually interesting  There is a lot of grey here  and I love the grey  The main character is one of the most complicated  sad  frustrating  fascinating and infuriating women I ve ever had the pleasure to read  Also  this novel employed shifting time and narrative  which are favorite devices of mine  There are a lot of comparisons to Gone Girl  and it s a very fair comparison  but this is also definitely its own tale   So many people recommended this book  even though it didn t sound like my jam I had to give it a go  I think my expectations were like medium  not crazy high like with Gone Girl where the whole world was all about it  but just several people I know  If that makes sense  Either way  it took me a bit to get into  the switching POVs confused me  I didn t see  it  coming and overall  I enjoyed it and highly recommend it  It s probably more like 4 5 stars  but still  Recommend  yes you should read  If Gone Girl is a crazy rollercoaster ride  The Girl on the Train is like being on a plain train  It took me three months to finish this  partly because I ve been busy and partly because I didnt find it as well crafted as Gillian Flynn s  I don t really mean to compare  but since everyone s been digging it as thrilling as Gone Girl  I would say that the storyline and the way the plot was presented became somehow predictable  The novel s opening is quite interesting  given the part that a story is being told by a narrator you re not sure to trust  I truly like severely damaged protagonists so it really is a plus for me  Rachel is a one memorable character  but unlike Gone Girl  I think the sense of betrayal as one unravel the twists and knots of the story is not as grave  Middle part has slow tugs but then picks up again on the second half  I also like the idea of three different narrators presenting their own perspectives that interconnects in solving the puzzle  I d give it a three for the plot itself  but I m clicking four  mainly because of the sympathy I felt for Rachel  the hatred that I invested for Anna  and estrangement I had for Megan  OH YES  dear reader  spoiler alert   of course it s Tom  That bastard  Possibly one of the best thrillers I ve ever read  The twists towards the end was the highlight  And the feeling of sitting at at the edge is one that s hard to shake off while reading this book  The only thing that bugs me is the ever changing POV  I give this one an easy 4 stars  It started slow but kept my interest through out the book  Faster pace than Gone Girl too  I understand why the publisher trying to ride the Gone Girl train for this book   pun intended  There is a girl  or actually a woman  and she s missing  leaving her husband a suspect  There are cheatings involved and everything isn t what meets the eyes All three audiobook readers performed well  Megan s narrator was a bit inconsistent though  There were parts she was exceptional and gave me chills and some part that the cadence of her voice was so wrong it took me out of the story  But all in all  highly recommended both the novel and the audiobook format  Enjoyed this very much  Opiniao publicada no Efeito dos Livros   A facilidade com que nos embrenhamos nesta historia  seja por simpatia com a drastica Rachel  com a inconformada Megan ou a ligeiramente paranoica Anna  e um ponto a favor  ja o outro e mesmo as migalhas de informacao que nos vao sendo dadas e que nos levam ate ao final  ate a descoberta do enredo  E raios  se eu nao desconfiei do a culpado a desde o inicio   Ler mais    I read this in one day and I suspect that it was a case of the right book at the right time  I was in need of something that I could read and enjoy without too much brain power or effort and this was the book It is not overly original and there are definite shades of similar thrillers such as  Gone Girl    Into the darkest corner  and   Before I go to Sleep   It is at times a little slow and repetitive which means it loses some of its thriller status but still a good read  Si bien todos los personajes del libro me parecieron re loquitos e inestables y dejando de lado el hecho de que cierta parte del  secreto  era bastante obvia  fue un libro muuuy bueno Algunas partes se me hicieron pesadas  pero no por la escritura o lo que sea  sino porque NECESITABA RESPUESTAS   Asi que me impacientaba y decia  necesito leer el final  y bueno    mi otra Vani NECESITABA SPOILERS Mas alla de ese gran dilema de spoilers  el suspenso fue bastante bien construido y no pude dejar de leer hasta terminarlo  3  The quality of mystery thriller novels like The Girl on the Train can be gauged by answering this question  how further were you into the book before you stopped caring about figuring things out  Author Paula Hawkins understands this well enough  and juggles the narration of her story in such a manner so as to keep that mystery alive till the end  And oh  she does that quite wonderfully indeed  The Girl on the Train is the story of a divorced  jobless  alcoholic woman Rachel who takes the same train each day to commute to the city  On her train journey  at a particular signal  she peeks in the lives of a happy couple living close to the tracks  whom she calls Jess and Jason  One day  she sees something in their house which would break her views about the couple and plunge her into a dark and sinister mystery  The story sounds like a version of Hitchcock s Rear Window  and it is  to begin with  But as the story moves forward  the reader is taken deeper into the lives of Rachel  Anna  who is Rachel s ex husband s current wife  and Megan  aka Jess   and how they intertwine with each other even when they are not aware about it  The book moves through different POVs  though Rachel is the key narrator in the story  But by mixing things up with different narrators as well as moving around a bit back and forth in time  Paula Hawkins makes this story much more interesting than it would have been in the form of a linearly narrated detective story  The thrill which you will get from reading The Girl on the Train arises from the form of writing  as if you are reading someone s diary  The characters themselves are not that likable  each with his or her set of serious problems  but there is no way you can keep the book down till the mystery is resolved  The book is being adapted into a movie by DreamWorks  with the director already chosen  I can see the appeal of making it into a movie   it has the kind of tension and drama that made Gone Girl such a big hit recently  But whether the movie works or not  Paula Hawkins  book deserves a read   This has been compared to Gone Girl in several reviews and while I get that  the books are more different than similar  This is not as dark yet it has a psychotic flavor that builds suspense throughout the story  The characters are flawed but yet manage to be likable or at least they gain our sympathy  The plot could have been hard to follow  but the story was well written and kept me guessing  even though I was not super surprised by the ending it could have easily gone a different way  I enjoyed the book and recommend it to lovers of mystery  3 5 stars but great as audiobook Great read  Did find it a bit confusing at the start with the characters  once I got that sorted I couldn t put it down   Em primeiro lugar  parabens a mim  consegui ler 21 livros ate agora  desde Janeiro  Passei o meu desafio do Goodreads  Este livro em particular ajudou  despachei o em menos de nada  90  num so dia  Nao posso dizer que seja o melhor livro do ano  sobretudo tendo em conta os que li ao longo destes ultimos doze meses   mas concedo lhe

dizer Este livro ganhou o premio da categoria de Melhor Thriller e Misterio do Goodreads  Se e merecido  nao sei  Como disse  nao e um livro particularmente marcante  mas le se de forma muito fluida e acessivel  o que  associado a curiosidade que desperta  faz com que o leiamos rapidamente Gostei bastante  Recomendo como leitura entre livros mais pesados e complexos  para uma leitura despreocupada e cheia de suspense  With all the comparisons to  Gone Girl  I was worried I d be reading a carbon copy  but aside from the dark  who done it  vibe  I didn t catch any direct Gone Girl influences  This book stands alone very well with a protagonist so believable  tragic and flawed that sometimes you physically cringe on her behalf  My only criticism is the ending felt a little drawn out  Once we had all figured out the villain  it felt like a bit of a waiting game for it to end  but overall I thoroughly enjoyed this book   This book was a quick read and it held my attention  Every once in awhile I felt like there was filler text but the story picked back up quickly  The story is told through multiple narrators but is not confusing so long as you pay attention to the date in the chapter title  This next part really isn t spoilerish but if you want NO information going in   DON T READ ANY FURTHER  I HATE adulterers   it rubs me the wrong way so from the start I hated  HATED Anna  That opinion never changed for me  I never felt bad for her  never worried for her   whatever  She made her bed  she can lie it  I like Rachel in the beginning but then I found her frustrating and annoying  I suspect someone with an addiction would make me feel that way and I didn t love it  I wanted to be done with her but she kept trying just enough for me to hold out hope for her  She was a mess  all of them were  Ugh   I liked that I didn t exactly see the ending coming  I had my suspicions but I didn t really decide until it was almost revealed so I always count that as a success I also liked that this author didn t really fool with unnecessary information  I like detail and all I just don t need 20 pages of it plunked down all together for me so I was happy that she wove the descriptions into reflections pertinent details   Im a huge fan of thriller novels  particularly psychological thrillers   and I enjoyed this one  PROS  Well written  thoughtful and detailed  Each chapter is artfully pieced together  with just enough detail inform the reader and enough ambiguity to keep the reader in the dark  I appreciated that I didn t suspect the killer until I was supposed to  although alot of other readers said they found it predictable  The most interesting part of this book is  of course  the narration and lack of credibility  For me  this made the book seem realistic  Each character has their own messed up view on the world  prefaced by real world struggles  eg  infertility  depression  cheating   Incorporating multiple narrators allows the reader to fill in some of the gaps in each persons story  and in turn  I was able to come up with my own theories of what was going on instead of being entirely guided by any one narrative  It also made me believe that every character was a suspect at some point  which is hard to do and it makes for an awesome read CONS  Pacing   I found myself struggling to get through once I reached the 75  mark  There s alot of back and forth between the main character and others that I found to be unnecessary   view spoiler Plot holes   I found that there were some things lacking explanation in the book  Not so much the main story  it resolves itself nicely in the end  but there were characters in the story that showed up  and then we don t know what happens to them   view spoiler  Lastly  I would have liked to see more differentiation between narrators  The writing is exactly the same throughout  where it should have been more distinct and at times I would have to refer back to the beginning of the chapter to know who I was reading about Overall  I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any other psycho thriller lovers  The reason I didn t give it a 5 was because of the cons I identified  it prevented me from  loving  the book  P S  I have never read Gone Girl so have no comparison there  I really enjoyed this book   in fact  I couldn t put it down in the way that I found myself picking it up just to see what would happen next  The characters were very well developed   I could feel each of them especially Rachel  Definitely worth a read  I have mixed feelings about this book  On the one hand  I felt it was well written and so amazingly suspenseful  For that  it gets four stars  On the other hand  with the exception of maybe Cathy   a secondary character   every single character in this book was deplorable  It was hard to root for any of these characters because I kind of hated them all   Enjoyed it but did figure it out read it and see if you can too This was a page turner for sure  I liked the multiple perspectives and getting into the psyche and motivations of each main character  The complexity of the characters and the plot twists made this a great exciting read  Overall a good suspense novel  My interest was piqued when many of the reviewers compared the novel to  Gone Girl   Unlike  Gone Girl  though  I found  Girl on the Train  to be a bit more predictable  This who done it novel kept me engaged enough that I wanted to see it through to the end  but the main character Rachel at times was a bit whiney for my taste   Gone Girl ish thriller that starts slow and overuses the whole  I got drunk and did a bunch of stuff and don t remember any of it  plot device  but I was engaged throughout  Enjoyed the read   Intense read  I really enjoyed it and had a hard time putting it down  I could have done without some of the language  but overall really liked it   Really easy read  Along the way you get a bit annoyed by some characters  but the story is well built up  Cool ending   The Girl on the TrainThe novel is based mainly in Rachel  a commuter on London s rail line  As she travels passed the home she once shared with her husband  she can t help but wonder about the residents she sees outside their homes  and how her lonely life and vivid imagination add to the evil that occurs at 15 and 23 Blenheim Street   I would probably give this 3 1 2 stars bit I rounded up  Told from the perspective of the female characters  this book kept me guessing through three quarters of it and I loved that about it  It s getting compared to Gone Girl quite a bit  but to me was a very different read  A quick read and a good one  Cok fazla bu tarz kitaplar okumayan biri olarak vasatin ustunde bir kitap oldugunu dusunuyorum  Baskalarinin aksine ben katili kesinlikle son sayfalara kadar tahmin edemedim  Beklentiyi yuksek tutmadan merakla okunulasi bir kitap  A delicious psychological thriller I had considered Gone Girl to be at the pinnacle of my favorite genre   the psychological thriller  The Girl on the Train sits beside Gillian Flynn s page turner  in my opinion  I foolishly began reading Paula Hawkins  book before going to sleep and could not stop until I reached the last page  As was true with Gone Girl  The Girl on the Train must be read carefully  and the reader must pay close attention to details  including the dates embedded in each chapter The story is told by three women  Rachel  whose life has pretty much bottomed out  rides a train to London every day to fool her flatmate into thinking she has a job  She entertains herself by looking into houses along the tracks and becomes almost obsessed with a couple she sees daily  In Rachel s mind  they are the golden couple and the object of her envy  She even gives them names Anna  whose house is close to that of the golden couple  is the wife of Rachel s ex husband  Tom  They have a young daughter  Evie  The affair  which ended Rachel s marriage  was devastating to her  but the most hurtful thing was Anna s pregnancy  Rachel had desperately wanted a child  but the only round of IVF that she and Tom could afford failed and the marriage with it  Megan  the golden wife  lives with her husband  Scott  in another house along the railroad tracks  Rachel is so enthralled by the couple that she fabricates stories about what she considers to be their perfect life  This all charges when she sees Megan kissing another man from the train window Rachel s already turbulent life takes another nosedive when Megan goes missing  Determined to help the police find her  Rachel is brought into contact with her detractors  Anna  Tom and Scott  Because of her alcoholism  she is treated as a pariah by them and as an unreliable witness by the police  Even she distrusts her faulty memory The story has countless twists and turns  which demand the reader s complete attention  The characters are beautifully developed as the complex people they are  Just when I thought I had a handle on them  I discovered a new nugget  which completely changed them  As is true in all well written books of this genre  no one is what he or she seems on the surface  The writing flows effortlessly  gradually building to a climax I highly recommend The Girl on the Train to fans of books like Gone Girl  Just don t make my mistake and start reading at 11 00 pm because you will most likely lose a night s sleep  True to its reviews  this book reads like Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl  and I think with a hint of All Fall Down by Jennifer Weiner   I was a bit slow to get in this story  but as soon as I did   wow  Hooked for sure  I had to know who dun it  Something that really drew me in was the authors ability to thoroughly manipulate the reader s emotions towards each of the characters at any point in the story  For instance  you feel manage to feel sorry for  disgusted and frustrated by  angry and annoyed with the protagonist  Rachel  and then you FINALLY realize  after a slow build  of course  why she is how she is  Oh boy  and then does that anger transfer or what  Finally  I m not one for loose ends  so where GG left me frustrated  at least TGOTT gave me some  SOME  closure   Thrilling and suspenseful from the very start  a real page turner  I was seriously impressed by the author s impeccable management of timing and information  which kept me nervous and hooked right until the end  Great book  Fun read for a snowy afternoon  Good for fans of Gone Girl  especially those who found the first portion of Gone Girl kind of boring  All action all the time here  This is the book that everyone is going to be talking about in 2015  It is building up a lot of interest  In my opinion rightly so   this debut book is going to make a long journey all of its own Rachel gets on the 8 04 train to London  she has been doing it for so long she knows not just which stations it will stop at but all the signals along the way At one of those signals  she can see into the gardens of some houses  She can see the residents  In fact Rachel has become so interested in one particular couple that she has given them names  Jason and Jess  and created a whole story for them  Their life looks idyllic and obviously divorced Rachel is missing what she once had But one day when the train stops at the same signal she sees something that does not fit in with this ideal life of these strangers  Suddenly the story she has created becomes a real nightmare  Rachel then gets involved with the real Jason and Jess  actually called Scott and Megan and it all becomes very close to home  Too close Can you trust Rachel though  As we learn more about her we see her rely on alcohol  These details are like drip fed to us by the author  is it this why she is divorced  Is it something else  And if she is always recovering from a hangover can we really believe what Rachel says or in fact sees Whilst we read Rachel s story throughout the book  it is alternated with two other female characters Megan and Anna  Which reality is correct  can we trust any of these characters and are any of their actions justifiable  You go through a number of emotions with these characters as you range from page to page with anger  sympathy and love As the train continues to stop at that signal  the story keeps going  It has you wanting to know why  it questions what you see  what you hear and most of all what you believe  I liked this about the book  I enjoyed being taken through all the twists and turns and getting back to where I originally was  I am not sure if I guessed the resulting outcome or whether I did not want to acknowledge it and let the book take me on this wonderful journey  It kept the heart beating  the pages turning and reading late into the night  Excellent stuff  I suppose that everyone does it   looks out at the houses they pass   only we all seem them differently  All saw them differently  Next time you observe other people s lives remember this book            Gripping  intense and utterly un put downable   5 stars for one wild ride and for being able to keep me guessing until the end  Very  very suspenseful  Great read  If you require characters that you can love  then The Girl on the Train is not the book for you  The characters are all pretty much despicable  And if you can t handle cheating  then stay away from this one  Other than that  The Girl on the Train is a great read Rachel is The Girl on the Train  She rides the train to work every day  passing by the house she used to live in with her husband  Tom  He still lives there with his new wife  Anna  who he dumped Rachel for  And they have a new baby  Talk about painful  Rachel deals with this pain by drinking  A lot Rachel becomes interested in a house just down the road from her old house where another young couple lives  She names them  Jess and Jason   And they seem to have the most perfect  loving relationship   Jess   whose real name is Megan  takes care of Anna s child  Megan does not have the perfect life  as Rachel thinks  Megan has lost the art gallery she used to run and now has nothing to do with her days except mope around Rachel sees something shocking from the train and after someone disappears  she goes to the police with the information  But she s been drunk so many times  she can t even be sure of what she s telling the police  and they don t believe much of what she says Hawkins weaves an intricate web around these five people  They become intertwined  unwillingly  in unexpected ways  These characters are awful  The more we learn about them  the more we loath  I get that they are unhappy for different reasons  in different ways  But jees  Do something for yourselves instead of complaining  I think the story takes a while to get going  but when I m listening I tend to be more patient with a slow building plot I did suspect  not right away  who the bad person was  well  they were all bad  but I mean the perpetrator   That didn t take away from the fascination I felt while watching this all play out  The Girl on the Train has been compared to Gone Girl  and while it did have the contemptible characters  it s a different story If you are a fan of the twisted who done it   as long as you can handle the characterizations and subject matter  then you should definitely pick up The Girl on the Train  Teens should like this one too  Really great book  Fascinating  engrossing and nail biting until the last page  Perfect weekend read although ending felt a little bit flat for me  I ve had my eye on this book for a while  so I put it on hold at the library  Problem was  60 other people did the same  LOL  But it was eventually my turn to borrow it As soon as I started reading  I was hooked  I mean  how could I not be  The main narrator  Rachel  is still hung up on the husband who left her two years ago  She s also a hopeless drunk who just couldn t stay on track  Well  except for the train track  because she rode that every single day  Even though she d lost her job MONTHS AGO Then we meet Megan  A woman who is so bored with her life that lying and cheating becomes her thing  Not to mention that she has some seriously dark secrets Oh  but there s more  Enter a woman called Anna  who is now married to Rachel s ex husband  Actually  she was Tom s mistress for a while before he left Rachel  Anna s now a wife herself  and a mother  but she s more concerned about the picture perfect family they look like from afar than what s really going on The night Megan disappears  the lives of these three women intertwine  One was so blind drunk she can t remember what she saw and why she got hurt  The other starts getting paranoid  And of course  one of them is missing I loved this book  It was deliciously messed up  The characters  the story  the conclusion    hell  even the locations are messed up because of these people  The writing is outstanding  It gripped me from the first word  Even though three women share the narration and all three are several degrees of fucked up  each POV felt sounded different  The one thing they all share is how self absorbed and unreliable they all are This story is what makes me look forward to thrillers  When they re written well  man  This is a great example of a complicated  gripping and super dark story that surfaces from a very simple topic  sociopaths    Great book  Wonderful  simply wonderful  even fascinating  I had the audio version  and the three narrator ladies were magnificent  And the characters were developed in a way  one had no idea  until the end  whom to like and whom to fear  And Rachel made it  Hope that s not a spoiler  this was a good and fast read Tal como diz na contracapa  o livro e de leitura compulsiva  Tudo bem  ele nao e muito grande  mas li o livro em quatro dias  sem grande tempo disponivel para leituras  Assim como a atriz Reese Whiterspoon  foi um livro que me deixou acordado grande parte da noite  No entanto  talvez por estar habituado a leituras fortes  nao achei o livro muito violento  nem perturbador ou arrepiante  Talvez o mais proximo disso que encontrei  tenha sido o terror psicologico do livro  Estamos metidos dentro da mente de uma alcoolica  com os sons tipicos da viagem de comboio  perdidos nas memorias difusas  confusos sobre os acontecimentos que precederam e estiveram envoltos num crime  sem saber em quem confiar  A escrita nao e nenhuma obra de arte  sem floreados  vai direta a questao  sempre na primeira pessoa  o que confere uma carga mais intimista a leitura  E um livro para as massas  Para a pessoa moderna  Mais  para o publico feminino  nao so por os pontos de vista serem da perspetiva de mulheres  como ele mostra uma visao pouco masculina  Aqui  as mulheres tem defeitos  mas isso e visto como normal  enquanto os homens a distancia parecem perfeitos  e quando se conhecem por perto  sao uns filhos da mae  E uma tipica perspetiva de mulher  O que mais me agradou no livro foi a humanidade dos seus personagens  e de longe a que mais me agradou foi Rachel  Criei empatia com o personagem desde o primeiro momento  E uma pessoa que mente com frequencia  mas e uma mentira ingenua  uma mentira que revela apenas falta de coragem  a coragem que fugiu com a sua vida perfeita e com o visual bonito que envergava  Ao longo do livro vamos conhecendo mais desta mulher  da sua personalidade labirintica que se revela ser das mais ingenuas e genuinas do thriller  Tambem gostei de todo o misterio  da forma como foi contado  das pistas deixadas no decorrer dos acontecimentos  A autora soube fazer muito bem todo o suspense  mas a identidade do  culpado  nao foi muito dificil de adivinhar  perto da pagina 200 ja tinha na mente que ia ser a personagem menos provavel  e que so podia ser aquela  Nao e nenhuma obra prima do genero  mas e hipnotizante  tem personagens riquissimas e muito atuais http   noticiasdezallar wordpress com Nem egy szivvidito olvasmany  a borod ala maszik  csak falod az oldalakat  hogy egyre tobb mocskos titkok zuduljon rad  Nagyon eros atmoszferat teremtett az irno  tetszett a stilusa is es az elbeszeles modja  tobb nezopont  reggel es esti  naplobejegyzesekre  osztva   Nem gondoltam volna  hogy ennyire megtetszik a kony  de biztos  hogy fogok meg olvasni az ironotol     Due to this book s presence on various bestseller lists  there is almost a pressure to read it  Do I want to be the only one that cannot discuss this  I wanted to save it until I finished another project  did so  and was rewarded by an excellent book that I read in one sitting  Compelling  complex  and an ending that surprised me The train is a unifying device to link characters in varying degrees of closeness  Rachel rides the train every day  it sets the parameters of her existence  it is one thing she can count on  There is alcohol  of course  but she cannot count on it  alcohol may be concealing repressed memories or it may be creating false memories out of hallucinations  Rachel is a very damaged person  Her rationalization of her use and abuse of alcohol will be familiar to some many Megan initially has another name in Rachel s mind  but she will eventually be Megan  Megan doesn t depend on alcohol  but has a belief similar to  if it feels good  do it   Not very conducive to stable relationships  especially since husband Scott  who also initially has a different Rachel name  seems to be away lot  Anna is the bane of Rachel s existence and her marriage to Tom  Rachel s former husband  does not lead to the establishment of a close friendship between the two women  The contrast between the beautiful  desirable Anna and the gone to seed  alcoholic  and fat Rachel contributes to a jealousy based relationship Tom is a hardworking  long suffering husband  understanding of both his wife and his ex wife  He just wants to be helpful and kind to everyone Throw in an almost unethical social worker and a couple of kids and we have a fast moving  interesting story  My constant question as I read was  How is the author going to tie this together  I was surprised  simply wow  loved it  keeps you hooked  who loved Gone Girl must go for this one  Thumbs up Paula  hope we will have more like this one  i know i had a few minor complaints as i was reading this    but after closing the book i dont really remember them it all went by so fast  so  5 stars   This one had me on the edge of my seat  I just couldn t wait to figure out what happened   This will capture your interest within the first few pages and then you won t want to put it down  I heard it s coming out as a movie this year and I just can t wait   I listened to this book on audio    There were three narrators   one for each of the main female characters  They all did an excellent job  Especially the one who played Megan   who  I discovered  also plays Molly Hooper on Sherlock     she did an especially good job narrating conversations   made them sound very authentic  The story itself was completely gripping  Told from three completely different perspectives  it came together in pieces  not creating a clear picture until the very end  I can understand the comparisons to Gone Girl  though the story is pretty different overall  But it has the same fast paced nature that makes you want to never put it down  Really liked it  4 5 stars  HauntingThis is not a ghost story  though I would definitely call it haunting  There is a quality about it that that is difficult to describe  like that moment between waking and dreaming where things almost make sense  where thoughts are slippery things that refuse to be held closely yet are on the verge of comprehension Let that not dissuade you from this marvelous novel  It is eminently comprehensible  It is just that you find yourself questioning your grasp of what is occurring every bit as much as our protagonist does  The truth seems forever just beyond reach  even as events unfold that rightfully should bring things into focus But that is because the author skillfully weaves this tale  around  facts  rather than through them  Our protagonist  an alcoholic woman so well written that I have to wonder if she does not come from personal experience  is victim to all the self doubt concomitant with that state  In her realm of half remembered events and reconstructed  reality   Rachel struggles to make sense of an event glimpsed from the window of a train  It is an event inextricably linked to her life in ways that only gradually become apparent to the reader I found this novel fascinating  It was a mystery with more than a bit of suspense  It made me wonder what the heck was going on  It made me cringe for Rachel in her alcoholism and cheer her for her dogged persistence in solving this crime  For she does solve it  Oh  yes indeed  Join the craze  read Girl on the Train  I read a lot of books and don t say this lightly  This book sucked me in and wouldn t let go until I marathon finished the book  I heard that the audiobook is narrated by 3 different people   that sounds amazing and I would also recommend it   This book was a frustrating read due to the main character  Rachel s  raging alcoholism  In addition  it was another of those books where one can t wholly trust the narrator s version of events  at least not at first  Although frustrating to read  the plot was interesting  and the ending was surprisingly logical with the information the reader finally has obtained I began thinking this book would be a three star  at best  due to the unlikable characters and the lies told by the various narrators  After the initial 50 75 pages  I became hugely intrigued with with what going to happen  and to whom  and I ended up feeling like it was a very good book  If you love Gone Girl and all that Gillian Flynn offers in the way of crappy  unreliable narrators who make your mind whip back and forth between  he did it  no  she did it    then The Girl on the Train is perfect for you  I happened to like Flynn s books  so I picked this one up as well when it came out  Loved it  I felt bad for Rachel  wanted to strangle Anna  could practically smell the sweaty  unstable Scott  felt bad  but not so very bad  for Megan  and would have done the exact same to Tom in the end  Grrr  Sociopathic  He deserved that corkscrew to the neck  but hoorah to Anna for snapping out of it in the end and helping out Rachel just a little bit  Good ending  Not the happiest  but good   Rachel takes the same train every weekday  the 8 04 from Ashbury to London  where she watches the landscape flash past  lost in the nightmares of her own tormented past  At one point  where the train slows  near where she once lived  she finds herself drawn into the lives of a couple who occupy a house near the house where she once lived with her ex husband  Tom  Jason and Jess  as she has named them  have the perfect life she didn t have  until one day she sees something that shatters the perfect illusion she has created  When she shares what she s seen with the police  she finds herself drawn into the lives of the couple  and the relationship of their lives with her ex and his new wife  and no one s life is the same afterwards The Girl on the Train is a debut thriller by Paula Hawkins that begins like a train journey  slowly leaving the station  and gradually picking up speed as life flashes past  mostly blurs with the occasional sharp  barely remembered glance  Hawkins pulls the reader into the lives of the characters  moving from Rachel to Megan  Jess in Rachel s mind  to Anna  her ex husband s new wife  in a journey that sucks you in like the muck at the bottom of a sluggish stream  This is mystery as mystery should be  with red herrings  misdirection  in a tangled line that leads inexorably to a shattering conclusion that will leave you breathless I received this book as a gift  and after finishing it felt compelled to share my views on it  Rarely does a debut novel impress me the way this one did  Paula Hawkins is an author to watch out for  I haven t felt so alive after a book in such a long time   I know understand the hype and I understand the comparison to Gone girl and I ll have to say that in terms of plot and page turning  thus book kept me turning those pages like tomorrow wouldn t exist   She writes so brilliantly and spins her web so magnificently  that my heart was slamming so hard against my chest whole reading the last 100 pages  She truly is taking writing to the next level  ditching that irritating style of secrets and mysteries and big revelations at the end    I won t be forgetting about this book anytime soon  I enjoyed this book I wish there was a 4 5 star  but I did really like this book  Lots of mystery and suspense  Right up my alley  This book deserves its positive reviews  Many times popular books can be over sold  but not this one  The story is vivid  and told from several points of view  This makes the reader aware of how much perception can influence opinion  and reality  Set on the fringe of London  this a book is full of intrigue  There are also threads of cringe worthy situations and creepy behaviors  which make compelling reading  The London references would be familiar to those who know the area  but are not distracting or overly imposed  In E book form  I found each chapter using a date and time heading required attention to follow the chain of events as the story bounced around a little depending which character was speaking  Otherwise  my favorite so far this year  Wow  this book just captures you and doesn t let you go  Wasn t expecting the killer to be who it was I m not sure how I feel about the female characters in this book  pretty flawed  Awesome story overall  Great bookI really enjoyed this book  The different characters telling their parts  It kept my interest throughout  Paula Hawkins is a very good author  I look forward to reading more of her books  Rachel is a creative thinker who invents an imaginary life for a couple who live in a house she passes on her daily train ride into London  With few redeeming qualities herself  the reader is still drawn to Rachel with her flaws and warts  Though she never manages to come across as likable  she is nearly completely honest and aware of her negative attributes  When her path crosses with that of the couple she has only viewed from the train  her perspective changes  No one is who they seem to be  and Hawkins slowly reveals each character s skeletons one by one until and the final suspenseful scene  It is a page turner  I really don t know why many people didn t like the book  but I loved it  Totally get why it deserves to be on the bestsellers list  I was glued to the book and finished it in a few hours A compulsive  fast paced  thrilling and mysterious read that had me at the edge of my seat   or more like  bed   from start to finish The whole story showed twists and turns and I found myself in Rachel s shoes as I took tried to grasp onto what the hell was going on  The book was already written really well with it shifting POV s and though not a fan of dual  let alone triple POV s  I think Paula Hawkins managed to pull it off pretty well What I loved the most about this book was that every character was flawed and not perfect at all  Each of them had their vices and things that made you want to hate them  And no jokes  all characters were flawed  no one a perfect husband  wife  friend   no one  All in all  I loved reading such a fast paced book after a while and I can also say that it was a smashing  nerve wracking and crazy debut by Paula Hawkins  Now that I travel by trains everyday  I think I will be more careful of my surroundings  but then again  Mumbai trains are so crowded I can t even see the bloody sky most times   A very compelling read  Outstanding  This is a brilliant read  A psychological thriller that keeps you guessing till the end  I look forward to the author s next novel This book has had so much hype that I was honestly a little worried that it wasn t going to live up to it but holy cow did it ever This was a twisty turny  keep you guessing to the end kind of book  with completely unreliable narrator s all three of these women were unreliable narrator s which is kind of fascinating because you never knew who was telling the truth or the truth as they saw it or are just lying completely  Every time I thought I had it figured out it would turn a different way  I thought I had it figured out many times and I never did Told by 3 women  Rachel  alcoholic  scorned woman  she is the girl on the train and honestly quite a mess  Anna  Rachel s ex husbands new wife and mother of his child  self centered and paranoid of Rachel Megan  missing  confused  self centered and craves attention The three audiobook narrators Clare Corbett  Louise Brealey and India Fisher all did such a fantastic job they truly brought these women to life and endowed each with such emotion  These were all new to me narrators and I will definitely be looking for other books any of these women have narrated  This book was amazing  it was great from beginning till end never bogged down and kept me guessing all the way through  I don t want to give any more away because this is one of those books where the wrong word could be a spoiler  suffice it to say Just Read This Book  Now 5 stars Loved everything about this book   from seeing alcoholism first hand  CRAZY  to the seed for the book in general  generally wondering about the folks you speed by and inventing histories for them   The characters were crazy but it worked   I loved the way this book surprised me and strung me along and even though I m tired  I m happy it kept me up past my bedtime  An all time favorite   Thank you Penguin Group and Net Galley for providing me with this e galley in exchange for an honest review  Wow  at first I thought I was reading a book about two crazy women and I was a little disappointed  But the story soon revealed their challenges that they were facing and they weren t as crazy as I first thought  The author really takes you deep into these characters and over the course if the story you feel many different emotions  I spent most if the book going back and forth over which character actually did the killing  It was great  I love when you can t figure out who done it  And when it was revealed I was in total shock  This book really reminded me of  Gone Girl  in many instances  It s one of those you can t put down  Unfortunately I had to and found myself wishing like all get out that I could get back to it  A real page turner that you will not predict the ending  A definite must read  There are some books that you immerse yourself in instantly  Books that  even when you aren t reading them  you re thinking about them  constantly  Books that play on your mind  make you wonder  poke your inquisitive nature  There are books that have you staying up late  just to read one more chapter  and books that you tell your friends to read once you ve read it    This is one of those books   This book is predominantly narrated by Rachel  although the book is split between three women who s lives all interlink in some way  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  Rachel introduces herself whilst on the train she catches daily  commuting home from her busy day in London  Only Rachel isn t focused on her job  her long journey home  or her family  She s focused on the lives of  Jess  and  Jason    a young couple whom she has personified and live on the street that Rachel and her ex husband used to share two years ago    Rachel looks out for  Jess  and  Jason  daily  becoming obsessed with them and daydreaming about their perfect life together  a life that the book suggests Rachel would very much like for herself    Until one day she reads in the paper that Jess   real name Megan   has gone missing  and that her husband Scott is the prime suspect  Rachel decides to tip off the police following an event she witnessed the day before Megan disappeared   However Rachel is an alcoholic  She is irrational  prone to blackouts and drunk dialling her ex Tom and his new wife Anna whom live down the street from Megan and her husband  The police dismiss her as a rubbernecker almost immediately  but Rachel is not that easily deterred  and is keen to involve herself as much as possible in the case as to find out what really happened to Megan  But the more she finds out about the missing woman  the less she likes her  Overall  the characters in this book are all pretty dislikable  Rachel is weak  self pitying and unnecessarily nosey  fat  addicted to alcohol  and physically less attractive than either Megan or Anna  Megan is a liar and cheat  beautiful and bored   constantly looking for new thrill at the expense of others  And Anna is a competitive  vindictive trouble maker who seems to want nothing more than to make Rachel s life as miserable as possible  while hiding behind the husband she stole from her in the first place  The men are by no means better however  Scott is controlling a violent behind the facade of his and Megan s perfect life  and Tom plays mind games and lies to get exactly what he needs from whoever he wants  In fact the only nice person in the entire book appears to be Rachel s best friend from university Cathy  who spends the entire book asking Rachel to cut down drinking and improve her situation  helping her along and generally picking up after her   This book is very cleverly written from three perspectives of three different women  Suspense builds from the first few chapters  along with empathy that would not otherwise be expected from such an unusual and dislikable main character  I definitely recommend      Twists and turns and flashbacks made for quite a read  Good writing  stands on its own  but of course begs for comparisons to Gone Girl  Amazing book  I love the way just when you think you have it all figured out there is a new twist that keeps you guessing    The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins Rachel rides the train everyday  She observes her surroundings  one of them being the happy couple she names Jason and Jess  She struggles seeing them so happy  after her recent breakup with her boyfriend  Tom  She handles this breakup with the usage of alcohol  but on one night  she is a complete drunken mess  A few days after  the police start investigating the disappearance of Megan Hipwell  Rachel fears she has done something  and starts to unravel the dangerous plot that has been covered up   I really enjoyed reading this book because it was fast paced and suspenseful  It was full of twists and turns  One example of this is when the reader finds out that Tom was the one who murdered Megan  I at first thought that Megan and Tom only had a neutral relationship  Another aspect of the novel that I liked was how dark the plot became  As the story starts  you think it is all happy and cheerful  but as the plot progresses forward  the dark web of events that occurred come to light  This novel is definitely for a more mature audience  around the age of fifteen  I am not one for murder mysteries  etc  but this one sucked me in  Great read and I highly recommend  Very hard to put down  The characters are not especially liikeable  but we know them  We know people like them  A fast read  Highly recommended   Jeden Tag pendelt Rachel morgens mit dem Zug nach London und dieser halt meist an der gleichen Stelle auf der Strecke an  Dabei sieht sie in einem Vorgarten oft ein junges Paar  dass sie Jess und Jason nennt  Fur Rachel hat es den Anschein  als fuhren die beiden ein perfektes Leben  genau so eines  wie sie es sich selbst wunscht  So wird der Blick durch die Fensterscheibe des Zugs zur taglichen Routine  Jess und Jason ein Teil ihres Lebens  Eines Tages beobachtet Rachel etwas Schockierendes und liest kurz darauf in der Zeitung vom Verschwinden einer Frau  Jess  Sie kommt nicht umhin es der Polizei zu melden und bringt damit Ereignisse in Gang  denen sie nicht mehr entkommt Mit Werbeaussagen wie   Dieser Thriller ist nicht zu stoppen  wird  Girl on the Train  derzeit angepriesen  Meiner Erfahrung nach sind diese Bucher mit solchen Versprechen  samt   vorab verkauften Filmrechten   entweder absolut gerechtfertigt  oder das genaue Gegenteil  Nur ganz heisse Luft  Ich fur meinen Teil bin mit sehr hohen Erwartungen an den Titel von Paula Hawkins herangegangen   448 Seiten und nicht mal 36 Stunden spater  war es trotz Arbeitstag auch schon inhaliert Das Buch erzahlt abwechselnd aus der Sicht von drei Frauen  hauptsachlich jedoch von Rachel  die mit sich selbst und dem Alkohol mal mehr  mal weniger Probleme hat  Perfekt gewahlt ist hierbei die verwendete Ich Form  denn dadurch lernt man die Gedanken und Ansichten von ihr viel deutlicher und naher kennen  ist absolut rasant von der Geschichte eingenommen und mochte auch nicht aufhoren  ehe man die Auflosung kennt  Was hat Rachel mit der verschwundenen   Jess  zu tun und war die beobachtete Beziehung mit Jason doch nicht so perfekt Von Flashbacks des Alkoholkonsums geplagt  wird nicht nur Rachel sondern auch der Leser von mal zu mal tiefer in die Irre und immer weiter zu neuen Wahrheiten gefuhrt  jedoch nie so schlimm  dass man den roten Faden verliert  Chapeau  Frau Hawkins  Dieses Buch ist wie ein Puzzle  in dem jedes Stuck genutzt wurde und das nur mit dem letzten  finalen Teil komplett und zufriedenstellend ist  Eine Auflosung  mit der ich nie gerechnet hatte Es ist nicht unbedingt etwas fur zarte Gemuter  Die Gedanken und Emotionen sind mit einer Handvoll gewalttatigen Ubergriffen relativ deutlich geschildert  Vor allem der   Thrill  mit psychologischer Tiefe lasst die Luft zum Atmen manchmal ganz schon dunn werden Wow  was fur ein Psycho Spiel  Wenn die Bahn das nachste Mal zu spat kommt  kann man nur hoffen  dass es so lange dauert  bis man  Girl on the Train  fertig gelesen hat  The Girl on the Train is a refreshingly original  addictive thriller  Told from the perspective of three female characters  predominantly an ex wife with voyeuristic and alcoholic tendencies  It s a mystery that unfolds in suburban London where commuter trains roll and stop along the sedentary backyards of houses that are filled with memories  marital bliss and conflicts  Houses with husbands and wives  nannies  babies and lies  Told with staggered timelines  a woman goes missing  one with a storied past  The husband is a suspect  or maybe it s her therapist  or could it be the lonely divorcee  Or maybe  it was the mysterious ginger haired man on the train  Chapter after chapter  we re like rail commuters  rolling along the tracks  back and forth  With stops and starts  twists and turns  Memory lapses  jealousies  betrayals  It s quite a ride   Girl on a Train  captures its characters emotions and thoughts flawlessly  A superb first novel by Paula Hawkins and is just the ticket for an engrossing  page turning read   so good  you might miss your stop on the train commute home  or work   What a vile  dreadful book  full of miserable nonredeemable people  If you despised Gone Girl  do not read this book  Five stars  I know  for a book I really did not  enjoy  might seem odd  but  the author did a  great  job  the story was compelling and rather well written  despite the fact that there was not a single character you could root for in the entire book  Overall  I found the ending a bit hard to swallow  and yet  it made for a great finish  Sometimes  showmanship isn t such a terrible thing  and I was able to suspend my disbelief and track along  It is meant to be fiction  you know  This is also one of those books that is made better as an audio listen  Several reviewers mention that the three characters narrating the story were flat  and were hard to differentiate on the written page  The three narrators who read the audio version were absolutely spot on brilliant  I do not like books  dramatized  by readers who attempt to give a book the feeling of a play   acting out  parts  these readers were narrating in the first person  so we were just hearing their thoughts  and each reader did a terrific job in bring her individual character to life  Overall  I d highly recommend it to anyone who really enjoyed Gone Girl  for those who didn t  well  it s the same sort of thing  so consider yourself forewarned   I read this in a day  The book is as compulsively readable as Gone Girl and for all the same reasons  Compelling  imperfect characters  murky plot points that materialize out of the gloom  agonizingly  deliciously  and then a rocket of an ending  Satisfying  but not completely tidy  either  Very  very well done  great book  I was sad to finish it  I could not put this book down  I read it in less than a day  There s not much you can say about this book without giving the plot away  but I really enjoyed reading something from the point of view of a character as deeply flawed and tragic as Rachel  You feel her embarrassment  sorrow  and hopelessness in every word and  in a cathartic way  it s refreshing  She s real  raw It s one of those that just starts and has you questioning   WHAT IS HAPPENING   throughout a good portion of the book  Highly recommend it  Loved it   It s crazy  and I m surprised how much I adored Rachael  She s always so down on herself  and an alcoholic   but she s just so real  This book is like Gone Girl in that I couldn t put it down  The twists are delicious    read it friends  read it NOW       2015 Reading Challenge W Josh   4 A Book Published This Year  Holy shit  This book was amazing  It has been compared to Gone Girl but I hated Gone Girl  This book was so much better  I listened to the audiobook and I have to give props to all 3 of the narrators  They were perfect  Just perfect  Many people only gave this book 4 stars saying that it was because none of the characters were likable  But I actually loved that about the book  All of the characters were a hot mess  Each in their own way  And I ate it up   I could not put this book down  I would have easily listened to this in one sitting if real life  and kids  didn t keep interrupting me  Sometimes it sucks being an adult with responsibilities   Wow  I can t believe that this was her first thriller  This story kept me on the edge of my seat  The twists and turns were amazing  I ve taken time out fro reading for a while  What a book to come back to  I couldn t put it down a d read the whole thing in two sessions  Granted  I was on a train myself both times     I ve seen a one star rating  stating how everyone was a big hot mess  Each to their own  I don t think you realise everyone is a mess right away and it slowly twists and turns  And actually  if anything it makes you sympathise with people who are  Don t trust anyone and think before you judge  We ve all sat across someone and thought about their lives might be like  if they re happy or smelt the alcohol on someone s breath and turned away in disgust  Well  think no further  sink into the life of Rachel  Anna and Megan  This book is full of secrets and a real hidden gem in the world of crime and thrillers  5 glorious gold stars I debated reading this book for a while  I hate being a bandwagon jumper of what s SO POPULAR right now  I resisted Game of Thrones for four seasons before caving   turns out people like it for a reason   cough Jon Snow cough    This book has so many 4 and 5 star ratings and so many pronouncements about  the next Gone Girl Oh Em Gee      and so many Debbie Downers who just didn t get what all the fuss is about  which is usually me  let s be honest here    that I couldn t decide what to do  So  when the e book went on a limited 24 hour sale for  5 I decided to get it and just read the damn thing already    I wanted to finished this book by eating it  I just loved it so much  I needed it inside of me  But  you can t eat PDF files I won t go over the synopsis too much as others already have  more deftly then I ever could  But I have to talk about Rachel  Megan and Anna  The book is told from the perspective of each of them  And they are all horrible people  But they are real  And I saw myself in each of them for different reasons  I ve been depressed and self loathing like Rachel  in my own head and obsessive  I ve been the new wife like Anna  just wanting the ex wife to stop being so goddamn crazy and disappear from our lives  And I ve been excerpts of Megan  fighting the urge to run away from a life that didn t feel right anymore  For the 7 hours it took me to read this book  these women were my reason for living  My husband didn t exist to me  Sorry  baby  The Drunk  Rachel is the most pathetic  despondent and miserable character I have ever known  So dependent on others for her happiness that she s lonely  And so lonely because she s dependent on others for her happiness  her ex husband Tom who she still loves and won t leave alone  the baby she can t conceive and  Jess and Jason    the couple she s never met but obsesses over to the point she develops an emotional relationship with them in her head  She s a blackout drunk drowning in gin and tonic and wine and gaining depression fat  been there   turning herself into someone she doesn t even like  But she can t stop   the hole she s dug herself into is just too deep  She s jobless  running out of money and just plain weird  cringe worthyly so  Like  just so So SO weird  It s hard to read her sometimes  but you can t not because as repulsive as she is  she s also gravitational  It s a masterpiece of a character study  The Bitch  Anna is  without even reading a word of her narration  immediately unlikable  You already know she s Tom s mistress  He left Rachel  married Anna  moved her into the house Rachel loved and had the baby Rachel always wanted  In some ways  Anna is the reason Rachel is divorced and fat and even more drunk then she was during her marriage  When we meet Anna she s a new mom and relegated housewife  recalling the good ole  memories of when she was the hot mistress fucking some other woman s husband   a woman she never had to care about   and the chick who turned heads walking down the street  Since marrying Tom everything has changed  Rachel is harassing stalking them all the time  Anna s scared for her child  because Rachel may or may not have tried to kidnap the rugrat   she hates living in Rachel s old house and she hates that she s become boring  Her sex life is lacking  she puts no effort into her appearance and worries about money  The glamour of being the mistress has disappeared  But while complaining she lets you know she wouldn t have it any other way  She loves her daughter so much  it s okay that she no longer has her career or body or sex appeal  And she feels confident in her marriage  even during the more difficult times  Tom will take care of whatever the problem is  and she believes everything he says  The more you read of her  the more she develops into a character you sympathize with  despite still not liking her at all  The Liar  Then there s Megan  Damnit Megan  Her chapters are set months before Rachel and Anna s  Megan is Rachel s  Jess   Her husband  Scott  is  Jason   The perfect couple  Beautiful and so in love  you can tell all the way from the train where Rachel watches them  Megan  at first  is just as Rachel would hope she was  But as the book progresses the real Megan is revealed to the reader  as well as to Rachel  She s is not the perfect blonde beauty with the perfect marriage and perfect husband  She s anxious  struggling with insomnia and constantly fighting this desire to run away from her life  She cheats on her husband  swearing she can t help herself  She lies about what she s been through  where she is and who she s with  Scott really has no idea what is wrong with her  so he suggest a therapist  She starts seeing Dr  Abdic  revealing her dark history and the tragic mistake that still keeps her up at night  But she can t tell Scott any of this  She refuses  Her marriage starts to crumble  irrevocably  She starts experiencing transference  thinking she s in love with Dr  Abdic who listens to her and never judges her and is always there for her  Then Megan goes missing  And the mystery of where she is  and who could have hurt her  splits into a million different directions  Leaving your head spinning as Hawkins drops diverting clues  one right after the other  There wasn t a character in this book that I didn t suspect at some point   7 in total  including Megan herself because that s just the kind of book it is  Rachel is pulled into the investigation  unable to let it go after pieces of memories convince her she knows something about Megan s disappearance  Seeing herself as some savior for Scott because  they always suspect the husband  and Jason is such a good man he couldn t possibly have hurt Jess  Rachel weasels her way into Scott s life and watches as he learns he didn t know his wife at all  Anna and Tom are pulled into the investigation because of Rachel  The cops think she crazy  Anna thinks she s dangerous  Tom is exhausted by her  Scott slowly unravels her lies and Rachel questions everything   unsure of what she really knows  because her drunken blackouts have her confused and missing chunks of time  The Girl on the Train is a fascinating  compelling page turner that NEVER slowed down  I ve read this faster than I ve read anything else this year  It s full of secrets and misdirection and the characters are straight addictive  like heroin  The overall plot is about what happened to Megan and the people involved  but on a much broader scale it s about the concept of taking a woman s whole essence and reducing her down to simply  a wife and mother   and the kinds of ways that can mess a person up when she can t fulfill those roles the way society expects her to  And it puts a spotlight on the fact that you can never know what goes on behind closed doors  you can never know a person based on judgments from a conversation or appearance  or even  if you ve lived with that person for years  My only gripe would be that the ending felt flat abrupt  But I ll be the first to admit I don t know if that s because it actually was flat abrupt  or if I just wasn t ready for it to end  I ll think about it and if I decide no  it was actually a disappointing ending  then I ll knock those 5 stars down to 4  But until then    Run an I V  and hook this book to my veins  I NEED it   After a devastating divorce Rachel moves in with a girlfriend in the suburbs of London and commutes into the city  back and forth on the train  daily  As the train passes the house that she used to live in she is devastated that her ex husband  Tom  is still there with his new wife Anna and their baby  Desperately missing her previous married life she focuses on the seemingly ideal couple who she names James and Jess who live near Tom and Anna  While she lives a good portion of her life under the influence of alcohol she is confused as to what is real and what is not  Shortly after Rachael discovers the perfect couple  Jess all of a sudden  disappears  Suddenly Rachael has a purpose in life as she sets out to discover what happened to the missing Jess  Slowly the author weaves a tale of mystery as Rachael makes the mistake of going to the police in a drunken state while she quickly becomes the object of their attention The story takes off at breakneck speed through the narrations of the three women  Rachael  Anna  and Jess Megan with just enough hints scattered here and there to keep me gasping as I read  I lost sleep  my eyes burned  and yet I read on  The women are allowed to rage and avenge as they slowly uncover the secrets between them and Rachel s creepy husband as the lies keep flowing entangling the four of them  Although none of the characters are likable they are curiously addictive not to mention so very much fun to read about  With each trip of the train bits of Rachael are revealed in this riveting but disturbing story  I couldn t help but cheer for Rachael every time she made a positive move and my heart broke for her when she took a dive  I started to give this book four stars but because Rachael is such a memorable character I had to give myself a week to think about it and I then knew it was deserved five stars because it was the best psychological thriller I have read in a long time  DreamWorks has recently acquired the movie rights for The Girl on the Train  I couldn t put this book down  If you liked Gone Girl  definitely move this book to the top of your list  Some of the characters were a bit irritating   but it was a quick read and definitely kept me interested to the very end   This book is suspenseful and compelling  I didn t want to put it down  Rachel  the girl on the train  is someone who almost everyone can relate to at some point in their lives  She is very real and likable  Rachel is suffering the loss of her marriage two years ago  drowning in her own self pity  exasperated by excessive behaviors  When a local woman goes missing  Rachel can t remember all of her actions that night  The story turns into a case of who done it with an unexpected twist  I loved the plot and connected with the characters  Alcoholic  newly divorced Rachel Watson is riding the train in to London from Ashbury  where she rents a room from her last and now only friend  Kathy  As usual  she drunkenly anticipates seeing her favorite couple in their backyard and in their house  curtains open  They apparently own the house  surrounded by similar cookie cutter family homes which abut the track  separated by a fence  It has become her only pleasure to see them share kisses and hugs  unaware of the audience watching them from the passing train  which temporarily stops in front of the house almost every day for a track signal  The canned gin and tonics she discretely sips all day kills her emotional pain  but it is not a pleasure as good as watching this handsome couple  The liquor only dulls her regrets  She has named the loving  happy couple  Jess and Jason   She feels connected to them  obsessed with their happiness  So when on yet another fruitless job hunting farce of a train journey  which she is enduring daily to fool her roommate into thinking she actually still has her public relations job instead of having been fired  she becomes panicked when see observes  Jess  kissing another man Four doors down from  Jess and Jason  live Tom Watson and his brand new wife  Anna  who was a restaurant server  in an identical house with the same layout as the blissful couple Rachel cannot stop watching  This house used to be Tom and Rachel s house  but after a pregnancy miscarriage and Rachel s descent into excessive drinking and blackouts  Tom moved on to Anna  who quickly had a baby Rachel is drifting in meaningless haze of movement masquerading as forward progress much like the train she rides back and forth on its unmoving rails  Tom wants her to really move on  and Kathy thinks she is going to work every day  even as she is losing sympathy for Rachel over her increasing erratic and irresponsible behavior as well as her endless drunkeness  Rachel has no plan  She does not care about getting a new job  All she wants to do is get drunk  and watch her favorite couple as she rides the morning and evening train from London  However  she is running out of money  She has embarrassing blackouts which are getting her into trouble she does not remember causing  such as midnight calls to Tom  threats to Anna  and finally she apparently tried to steal Anna and Tom s baby out of their house  which she invaded uninvited Then one day she wakes up covered in blood and bruises with no memory of the previous night Megan  Jess  Hipwell is at loose ends  She closed her art gallery due to lack of customers  and now she is looking for something to occupy her life  Unlike the fantasy of bliss that Rachel has created for her  she is restless and unhappy in her marriage to Scott  Jason   Out of pure boredom and unable to move on to new career  she decides to work as a nanny for Anna and Tom  It is a dull and unfulfilling job  What she actually wants is an affair  When her inability to sleep morphs into daily panic attacks and nervous anxiety  she finally goes to see a therapist  The psychiatrist is not exactly helpful in her opinion  but he is very good looking  Very  Then  Scott comes home one day and Megan is gone  Where is Megan  He calls the police Anna  a nervous young mother  wants Rachel arrested  She has no doubt Rachel is dangerous  violent and unpredictable  She is uncertain  not that she admits it  of Tom s love  despite his assurances  because Tom keeps rescuing and excusing Rachel  Rachel is obviously a continuing threat to her baby and her marriage  After Megan disappears  Anna discovers Rachel is hanging about in front of their house  supposedly trying to find out more information about Megan  Why would Rachel care about Megan  their ex babysitter  It is obvious to her Rachel wants Tom back  Well  She is not having it  She is going to see that woman pays for her continuing disruption to her life I think this book is wonderfully entertaining and quite an interesting twisty mystery  The story slowly picks up speed like a train leaving a train station  but its pace becomes G force quick until a scary and satisfying finish is reached view spoiler    despite a slight drop in speed at the end as a character decides to explain certain confusions which acted like a tap on the brakes  hide spoiler   There are reviewers who believe this story compares to  Gone Girl   but I do not think so  It is fun  with surprises and shocks suddenly directing the reader into suspecting first this character  then that character  as responsible for Megan s disappearance  There is even a possible red headed suspect Rachel meets on the train  a redheaded red herring   Rachel is not sure that she did not do something bad  I guess if other readers think this is like  Gone Girl   and it serves to interest people in reading the book  not that I can see there is anyone who has not already read this book  if going by the number of GR reviews previously posted before me is any clue   then I join in the chorus to recommend this novel because it is a tricky and character driven mystery  whatever other book it may resemble  I do not agree it is another  Gone Girl   however   I CAN agree with everyone who thinks this a fun and exciting book  I read  listened  straight through for hours to finish the last half  Wow  is this story a thriller in the last chapters    I loved this book and could not put it down  Very much like Gone Girl which I also really

seeing them at their window  in the garden and behaving like any other young couple in love  A perfect relationship   Rachel wishes her life could be like that One day  the train stops as usual at the same signal but Rachel glimpses something shocking that will change everything she thinks about  Jess and Jason  Soon Rachel has the opportunity to become part of the life  Jess and Jason  lead    soon they will get to know Rachel for who she is and no longer just  the girl on the train   This is a gripping book which made me just want to keep reading and reading  The story is told from the point of view of 3 main characters which is part of what kept me hooked  I really hope that this book is just the first of many good books from Paula Hawkins   I will be definitely be waiting with bated breath for her second book  Weird shit is happening in this book guys  WEIRD SHIT  I really like the fact that all the characters in this book is so dark and problematic and it is certainly one of the books that you talk about to friends hoping that they will read it because you want so bad to talk about it with someone who experienced the emotional rollercoaster that this book provides  I read few chapters while listening to Gone Girl soundtrack and it was sooo amazing and spooky  Can t wait for the movie  I had heard a lot of talk that if you were a fan of  Gone Girl  you would be a fan of  The Girl On The Train     I agree  I loved them both and found that they had several similarities to me  pretty much all of the main characters in both books I despised  While I did feel sorry for Rachel in  The Girl On The Train   I also didn t particularly like her   but each also had enough stark differences from the other that it was easy for me to enjoy reading both of them for different reasons  Even though I disliked most of the characters in Paula Hawkins novel  I still couldn t help but keep reading  It s dark  haunting  and depressing psychological thriller  but an incredible effective read thanks to the wonderful writing skills of Hawkins  This is definitely a novel that divulges into the behaviors and inner working minds of people    their motives  actions  and reasons behind them  The story itself is told from the viewpoints of three different women  Rachel  Megan  and Anne  All three of these women are unreliable  and each has their own secrets to hide  The main character is Rachel  who takes a train into London each day that rides right past her old neighborhood  From the window of the train  Rachel sees not only her old house  as well as reminded of her past  happy life   but also the house and daily activities of a couple who resides down the street from her previous home  In her mind  Rachel has given the couple names  Jess and Jason  and imagined their perfect life in her mind  When real life does not live up to the fantasy Rachel has created in her head  she becomes entangled in a murder case that takes place and also twisted her into her past life she left behind  A perfect book to read if you are looking for a darker  not necessarily happy tale   This book reminded me of Gone Girl  The ending was totally unexpected  I enjoyed the suspense trying to tie all the knots and connecting all the characters  For a minute I thought Rachel had multiple personalities  The Girl on the Train  A Thriller It is such a gradual approach  the reality of this book  At first watching the troubled behavior of an alcoholic woman made more real by this author s absolutely astounding grasp on alcoholism and how it affects one  I thought that was to be the subject matter of the book  Then the creepy feeling that there is so much more evil in this book than first meets the eye  Bizarre acts after compulsive behavior make this a page turner you can t put down  This book makes for a mental disturbance equal to the train that that roars down the tracks  making a setting for murder  I strongly recommend this book  Simply put a Great read   Since there have been hundreds of reviews done on this one  MY review will be short and sweet when I started reading  I was a bit underwhelmed  I didn t like the characters at all  One was a whiney alcoholic still bemoaning the fact that her husband had cheated on her two years previously  I just wanted to shake some sense into her  Then I met the ex husband     jerk of the year  His present wife comes across as a weakling    yes  dear  no dear  whatever you say  dear   shudders  But as I got deeper and deeper into the book  I realized that even though these characters had no redeeming qualities as far as I could see  they were actually interesting  And I was getting more and more involved into the story Bottom Line     this one s a winner    this one merits 5 stars all on its own    I think it s a terrific women s fiction story complicated or compimented by murder and psychological intrigue  Two married women are haunted   one by the inability to have a child and by the resultant break up of her marriage  and the other by a secret she keeps close to her chest  Their lives intersect through a third married woman and all the men in their lives  I don t want to give the plot away  but let me say it was an almost perfect thriller  Not sure Anna was in character at the very end  however   It s been awhile since I read a book this fast  3 days straight IMO with 3 hours each  I ve been hooked by the thrill of finding who was the killer of Megan but most importantly I wanted to see how life would change its course for Rachel  Whenever I read a story that starts with such a great endurance of pain and sadness I know something good is gonna happened  There is always good in people  and a lot of effort will show it  There is always meaning in everything we do  even by some instinct  I think I can just skip Gone Girl after reading this first  4 5 stars maybe  I definitely had trouble putting this down but thought the end was not quite as good as the rest of it  I also thought parts of it were slow  Overall  I recommend this book   With some of the books I see on the bestseller list  I am wary that they will be overrated and I will be disappointed  as this happens quite often  I m happy to say that was not the case with this story  This was not your run of the mill mystery   it kept my interest to the very end  Well written and highly recommend  Thriller books movies seem to be  in  right now  and when someone recommended that I read this book I was expecting another Gone Girl or Serena  This book was similar to those others in someways and completely different in others  I loved that the narrator was so unreliable  being a depressed drunk  you were figuring out the plot with her  she didn t know anymore than you did  Basically a woman  Rachel  is torn apart by a divorce and the inability to have children  She rides the train to London every morning passing by a house were a seemingly happy couple lives   she has named them Jason and Jess  One day she finds out Jess  whose real name is Megan  has gone missing  Feeling connect to Jess Megan because she has been watching her from the train feels the need to help solve the mystery  Not only is this a hard mystery to crack  but Rachel s own limitations  hinder her ability remember  and be taken seriously by law enforcement  This book had me guessing until the very end in true thriller form  and I loved it   Be prepared to be swept into a seriously riveting story  Nothing is what it seems and no one is who you think they are   So good  Guessed the killer partway but still was not certain  Really great thriller  I know this debut novel is being compared to Gone Girl  but I enjoyed this one a whole lot more  You kept me guessing till almost the very end   Well done Ms  Hawkins    Brilliant Book  Definitely 5 Stars  Unfortunately  I found that all the characters are extremely  unlikable   A debut psychological thriller that will forever change the way you look at other people s lives Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning  Every day she rattles down the track  flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes  and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck  She s even started to feel like she knows them   Jess and Jason   she calls them  Their life  as she sees it  is perfect  Not unlike the life she recently lost And then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough  Now everything s changed  Unable to keep it to herself  Rachel offers what she knows to the police  and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next  as well as in the lives of everyone involved  Has she done more harm than good  I have seen quite few people on metro reading  The Girl on the Train  in the past few weeks and it seemed to be pretty popular top of it  After reading the novel  I can see why so many people are talking about it  It s thrilling  mysterious and you can t help but wonder what happens with characters next  Of course from moment that Megan goes missing  it has the reader wondering  who is behind it  Who is the reason that she went missing in the first place  It s a type of thriller that has you wondering who the real killer is  I enjoyed fact that novel was written in multiple point of views  so that way you got view of each different character  Megan  Rachel and even Anna  Also the fact that two of the characters had their issues  and at times the reader couldn t help but wonder  if what they are saying is actually true  I did think it was cool  that all that started with Rachel taking a train  considering when I started reading this  I was on metro on way to work  It made the story a bit different  those other psychological thrillers that I had read in the past   Rachel  Megan    Despite their issues  I couldn t seem to help but love them  Maybe it was because in a way I felt sorry for both of them  In a way  both of them can relate to one another  because both of them felt like they didn t belong anywhere  Otherwise why would Megan have an affair  If she was happy with Scott  There must been a reason for it  Once I saw how Scott was with Rachel once he found she lied  I could see why she did  though Tom was no better  Her therapist seemed to be the only one who even cared  I can see why she grew to like him  He really cared about Megan  even if he didn t admit it  I just had that feeling that he did  As for Rachel  I can t blame her for drinking  after everything that she went through  Honestly I don t know how she was able to handle way she did  Considering she disliked Anna  she still came  to warn her once she put clues together about Tom  That takes a lot  to go to woman that your husband left you for  It takes courage  Tom was last person I suspected  even I didn t see it coming  But once Anna mentioned that he lied a lot  in way I started suspect that something was off  but never did I think that he was one who killed Megan  That s another thing that I loved about this novel  it had so much suspense in it  and twists and turns that even the reader didn t see coming  It took me a day to finish this book because I didn t want to put it down  I wanted to see why Megan went missing  if Rachel actually had something do with it  what actually happened that night  Most of all I wanted to see how all of it would come to end  It was unlike anything that I had expected  I was blown away by the story  the characters  It s hard to believe that it was her debut novel  It s an author that I am going be looking forward to  An Extraordinary Journey   Super thrilling and a great mystery  I would say even better than Gone Girl Edit   10 4 2015 Almost a month and a half after my initial review  I m coming back and bumping this up to 4 5 stars  rounded to 5 on Goodreads   I have not been able to get this book out of my head  I keep randomly thinking of how engaged I was during this one and looking for more thrillers to read that will hopefully compare to it  As I mentioned  I was not a huge fan of the genre before reading this bok  so I can safely say that this book single handedly turned me onto thrillers and in my book  that s worthy of much higher than the rating I originally gave it    Original Review   8 23 2015 This was a solid 3 75 stars for me  Mysteries and thrillers normally aren t my cup of tea  but I enjoyed this one a fair bit  Some of the characters really grated on my nerves  but I m not sure if they were intentionally written to be disliked or if I just disliked them  I enjoyed the fact that this book dealt with some heavy issues along the way of the main plot without being super overbearing about it  I was a little bit disappointed with how the main plot line ended  but that didn t hamper my overall enjoyment of the book too terribly much   A great read  un put downable and a page turner to the end  I enjoyed the diary format and the simultaneous narratives  structured around the train journey and the single location  It has a consistent economy of style  it s right to the point  at times visceral  with nothing wasted and I felt this worked well  particularly for the content and theme  It s a contemporary novel  with a fast pace and sense of suspense throughout  as good a thriller a you ll have read in a long time  Great debut  look forward to more  I am never getting married  wow  i didnt see that coming  rachel has always been the character that i rooted for since i started reading  she is desperate  damaged and lonely  what she did wrong was love somebody else first rather than herself  anna  fuck hated her till the end  what a hoebag  i just cannot take it when people cheat  and megan  she s just really screwed  she loved herself too much but at least she wanted to be a better person for her unborn child  gawd and tom dont even get me started  one of the best books i have read since gone girl  and i am not surprised how crazy these people are  i work in a stressful environment and i could understand how these people become damaged as they are  so i found the darkness of the book entertaining and intruiging  This was the best book I ve read all year  Very readable book with an unreliable protagonist that keeps you wondering  I enjoyed it  Amazing book  Could not put it down    WOW  I was so excited to read this book when I read the description on Goodreads  I am so glad that I got the chance to read this book  I love the way Paula Hawkins gives a little of each woman s words throughout the story  Rachel is a mess  but I like her  She just couldn t let Tom go and eventually that caught up with her  I hope really that she stops her drinking because she does some crazy mess when she s drunk  Megan s story and past is so sad  I thought I was going to cry when she was telling Abdic her past traumatic event I did not like Anna at all  and even in the end I didn t like her  She s all about herself and Evie  of course  but I think she s very conniving and an ugly person  I recommend this book to anyone who loves Gillian Flynn s stories  as this really made me think of something she would have come up with  I hope we see more thrillers by Paula Hawkins   OH MY GOD  This is the best book I ve read in a while  I couldn t put it down  literally I stood by the kitchen counter reading the last bit It has all of the somberness and unlikeable characters of a Gillian Flynn book  but you actually want to care about them  There are drunks  murderers  good samaritans  you just don t know which one is which  What happened to this person  did she run off  If so with whom  Did someone kill her   WHO  Is it a big joke  who is on whose side  You will tear through this book until you find out The main narrator  Rachel  is one drink away from cirrhosis  She makes the worst decisions possible and all you can do is watch  It s like being trapped in a car going off a bridge  But you want to like her  Every few years I come upon a book that becomes the most wonderful time suck  I count the minutes until I can pick it up again  I miss my stop on the subway  my hour long commute feels like minutes  Welcome to  The Girl on the Train   What starts as a potential chick lit storyline  overweight Rachel just can t let her ex husband go and fantasizes about the lives of a beautiful couple she passes every morning on her commute  quickly turns into a wonderfully engrossing mystery when one of the main characters goes missing  There are multiple narrators  all unreliable  none wholly likable  I ve heard people grouse that they were able to figure out the twists early on  This was not my experience but  even if it had been  the book was delectable  Read it when you have easily cancelled plans on the horizon  BrilliantI loved it  Paula Hawkins created crafted so many layers of speculation it was BRILLIANT  I hope it makes it to the big screen  If it does I will be there on opening day  dusununce konusunu pek de orijinal veya yaratici buldugumu soyleyemem  ama karakterleri anlatisi ilgimi ceken ve dort okuyusta bitirmemi saglayan surukleyiciligi veren sey oldu  kitabi klasik bir murder mystery den ayiran sey de bu sanirim  olaydan ziyade karakterlerin arkaplanina odaklanmasi  ilginctir ki kendi kendime surekli  abi kitapta olay olmayinca sikiliyorum  diyodum ama gorunen o ki kitap zevkim hakkinda hala bir kesinlige varmis degil mis im     ayrica tum kitabi nils frahm   says dinleyerek okudum ve biraz gone girl   gerilim havasi aldigim bu muzik bayaa yakisti bence 4 5 5 This book is absolutely NOT predictable  Those books are very rare   at least the ones I have chosen to read I must say that at the beginning I was not sure I liked the book  It really started out slow  I had to push myself   thank goodness someone told me it had a slow start  or I might have hung it up early  However   once I got into it  I was addicted  There is definitely intrigue  drama  a huge mix of emotions to go around  I thought I had it figured out so many times   but I was so wrong   I really enjoyed the writing of this author  Although it was slow to start  after getting into it  I saw the point  I don t know that it could have been written in any other way  I liked the fact that the story was told in 3 different voices   this added to the story in so many ways  I want to thank those that recommended this book   I don t think I would have read it  but I am certainly glad that I did  I want to find others of the same type  holy fucking mother jesus  I have lost control over everything  even the places in my head Thoughts upon finishing this book  Holy shit  holy shit  holy shit  what the fuck is wrong with people   and I mean that in the best way possible  This book is so intense and suspenseful and it honestly reminds me why thrillers are one of my favorite genres  It s so hard for me to believe that this book is Paula Hawkin s debut novel  It is absolutely outstanding  The ending gave me chills This book is being compared to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn and I do see a lot of similarities  I think this book was more quick paced right from the very beginning  which I liked  but I loved both of these books equally  It had the same dark and gritty feel as Gone Girl  and it also shares the same idea of questioning what happened to this girl and who s to blame and where did she go  I absolutely love mysteries like this  We get to read from the perspectives of 3 females  Rachel  Anna  and Megan  Honestly  all three of these characters are completely fucked up and have a lot of issues  but that made it all the more fun to read  Our main protagonist Rachel is deeply depressed  she s also a pathological liar and a drunk alcoholic  It was interesting to read from her perspective because I never knew when she was telling the truth or when she was having her blacked out version of the truth  The writing style of this book is on point  it is constantly suspenseful and there are several curve balls that I wasn t expecting  especially towards the end   I had theories throughout the entire book but I never got it right and I was so shocked while reading the final chapters of this book  I could not believe it  I thought I had a generally understanding of who all these characters are  or who they say they are  and then they turn around and do something crazy and unexpected and wow  you never really know who someone is behind closed doors  Even the nicest people can be completely insane  That s what I liked about this book is that every single character in this book was dark in their own way and had something to hide  I think that Rachel  Anna  and Megan were all messed up in their judgement at some point but it didn t make me like their characters any less  This book easily goes down as one of my favorite thrillers ever  Right up there with Gone Girl and Into The Darkest Corner  I love shit like this  I can t wait to see what other stuff this author puts out there  I ll read anything she writes     Loved this way more than Gone Girl  Same kind of story  Someone is missing  possibly dead  Who did it  You hear from some different voices  each one adding something a bit different to the story  I especially appreciated the way the story changed as the reader came around the bend of a curve of a new view  I couldn t stop reading  All the hype is well placed  this novel is fantastic  It moves with the unrelenting momentum of the train that carries the narrator past her old life and her new life  and Hawkins does a brilliant job of immersing us into the foggy confusion of an alcoholic  I tried to figure out what happened many times during the novel  but did not fully comprehend it until the truth was revealed  Gasps and shrieks from a morbidly marvelous ending make me encourage anyone who loves thriller suspense to read it  Highly recommended   WOW    Excellent   very suspenseful with lots of unpredictable twists  This gets compared to Gone Girl a lot  and I ll say that the constant tension is similar  but the characters of Girl on the Train are infinitely more likeable and even sympathetic  which made it a much more enjoyable book for me  Highly recommended  I listened to the audiobook and the three narrators do an excellent job  I m a picky reader  If it doesn t grab me right away  my mind will wander and I ll set it aside never to be picked up again Not so with The Girl On the Train  I loved how each chapter is written as if from a diary entry  and how each chapter is a different character in the unfolding mystery  It really did keep me guessing until the end  So good  This book is set to be made into a movie starring Rebecca Ferguson  Emily Blunt    Jared Leto  I m looking forward to see how they recreate the diary entries in the cinematic format   Rachel s life is falling apart  Alcoholic  overweight and still hopelessly in love with her ex husband  she gets the same train into the city every morning even though she was fired from her job months ago and spends her days hanging around in parks and public libraries Each morning the train stops at the same signal and Rachel stares at the back of the same house  occasionally getting a glimpse of the couple who live there  She fantasises about that couple  creating for them the dream life that she wanted for herself  Then one day she learns that the woman who lives in that house has been murdered and she realises that she has a vital piece of information about that woman  something she has glimpsed from the train that makes all the difference The cleverly structured narrative drip feeds you just enough truth to enable you to navigate through the maze of confusion and misery that clouds Rachel s vision  Is she just a sad sensation hungry drunk  looking for meaning in other people s lives because she has lost all hope of finding it in her own  The police certainly think so  To them she s just another one of those sorry individuals so fascinated by a violent crime that they cannot stay away  But what if she really does know something about the murder A tightly plotted character driven thriller  compellingly narrated and full of twists and turns  The Girl On The Train draws you into the lives of a group of characters you may not want to know but cannot ignore  Rachel is unable to reconcile herself with her inability to have children and her subsequent divorce from Tom  the love of her life  No amount of constant pleading and whining will jar him away from Anne  the woman who is now the mother of his child  As a result of turning to drinking to ease her pain Rachel has turned into a lonely  uncontrollable drunkard  managing to get fired from her job  Read the rest of the review on my blog  You Decide  Should I read it or not    http   shouldireaditornot wordpress c    Unreliable narrators are all the rage right now  but this is the first one I ve encountered who is unreliable because she drinks herself to blackout on a regular basis  Wow  This is the most deeply ashamed protagonist I ve seen in a while  When I heard the premise  it reminded me of The Infatuations by Javier Marias  which is also a story of a bystander becoming enamored with the life of familiar strangers  In both  there s a murder and the bystander gets involved with the surviving spouse  But that s about the end of the similarities  Hawkins  novel is much more accessible because it prefers to be suspenseful rather than philosophical  about love  death  grief  shame  even alcoholism  for that matter I admire this novel  especially as a debut  because Hawkins could have taken it a million directions  and it felt very much like she knew exactly which story she wanted to tell  She didn t get distracted trying to fix poor Rachel for us  or even to sober her up very directly  which would ve been a colossal buzz kill  As rehab tends to be  Rachel  Megan and Anna are all quite distinct in their sensibilities  both recognizable and complex  They don t like each other and there s no you go girl sentiments as an easy out  Babies are a problem in this novel  for everyone  Scott  Tom and even Kamal have their own particular shade of bullshit  yet Hawkins doesn t engage in the man bashing the story tees up for us  That s for your book club  I guess I think Hawkins has written a compelling story that should make us flinch  on so many levels  She doesn t give us anyone to  like  and she doesn t fix what s broken in her characters  Yet she does give us a satisfying ending and a good read  Loved it from start to finish Wonderful  suspenseful  and completely unexpected  I enjoyed this book from start to finish and had a hard time putting it down  LOVE LOVE LOVE this book  I would make sure you can read the last 50 pages or so in one sitting  You won t be able to put it down  www lizliska com  Hollowness  that I understand  I m starting to believe that there isn t anything you can do to fix it  That s what I ve taken from the therapy sessions  the holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mold yourself through the gaps   Paula Hawkins  The Girl on the TrainSo I just finished The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  and all I can say is  read it now If you liked Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn  then you will love The Girl on the Train  It has the same mystery  intrigue  and psychological twisted ness as Gone Girl  but a little different Rachel takes the commuter train to London everyday  The exact same commuter to and from London  morning and night  Everyday the train stops at the light by the same houses in a passing suburb on her commute  It is here that she gets her daily glimpse of Jess and Jason  a couple who live in one of the homes that she watches everyday  Jess and Jason have become a fantasy for Rachel  a perfect couple she idolizes until the day she sees something shocking that changes everything  The next morning she awakes from a terrible alcohol induced black out and everything is very  very wrong  The news broadcasts a shocking turn of events for Rachel s beloved Jess and Jason and her fleeting memories from the night before do nothing to help her believe she wasn t involved or witnessed something in someway  There s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home    Paula Hawkins  The Girl on the TrainI don t want to dive too deeply into the plot because there are so many good twists and turns and I do not want to give anything away  but I HIGHLY recommend reading this book  The main character Rachel is a serious train wreck  I do not mean this in a comedic or endearing sort of way  Rachel is a train wreck in a sad  pathetic  and horribly disturbed way  Emotionally damaged would be a polite euphemism to describe her  and she is absolutely fascinating to read about  I found myself  more than once  shouting at her in my head saying   Rachel  What are you thinking   She is a cringe worthy character  wonderfully flawed  raw  and so very real  I am not the girl I used to be  I am no longer desirable  I m off putting in some way  It s not just that I ve put on weight  or that my face is puffy from the drinking and the lack of sleep  it s as if people can see the damage written all over me  can see it in my face  the way I hold myself  the way I move    Paula Hawkins  The Girl on the TrainThis book was mysterious  interesting  creepy  and wonderfully written  I was hooked the whole way through  Un capolavoro  Un ottimo thriller  coinvolgente e originale  Letto con avidita dalla prima all ultima pagina  Don t get me wrong  This book isn t perfect and has one or two loose ends that aren t completely tidied up  I say that first because I absolutely LOVED it  It had my heart racing and I couldn t put it down   What s he going to say now   I found myself asking as I raced to turn the pages  Three narrators  all unreliable and all absolutely believable  Fast pace  thrilling plot  plenty of twists  If you liked Gone Girl  you ll love this  My full review is on izzyreads com No spoilers in this review Okay  here s a bold statement  This is one of the best books I have ever read  After gaining a degree in English language and literature  and publishing books myself   that s perhaps a strange statement to make  And  weirdly  I agree with all of the one star reviews too  The characters are not in the least bit likeable  the person  who done it  stands out like a beetle on a white rug from an early stage  but these things  for me  are unimportant I m not interested in the  oooh     who could it be       dangling like string in front of a cat  for 400 pages  a handful of suspects  wanting me to attempt to spot the least likely person     to put them in the frame     that would be dull  dull  dull What I am looking for is verisimilitude  that sense of reality  in the deftness of description  the desperate and genuine human frailty of the characters  I got all that and more Okay  confession  I have travelled those lines into London now and again  and perhaps that has made me biased as to the realism  but  confession over  I have so many other things I love about this book Weirdly motivated by pet hates  here is what I love  I loath over description   in every scene  the author picks out the 3  sometimes 4  occasionally 5 most important aspects of the scene and describes them in a fresh way  from  boiling frogs in reverse   you may need to read Chris Argyris to get that one  to the silence  stretching out  filling the space between us   to  the familiarity of walking upstairs and knowing which one is going to creek   I could go on and on  Whereas most authors will trot out cliches of  lump in throat   jolt of electricity  etc etc  Hawkins pretty much avoids  okay  couple of instances at most  these throughout the book Next point  dialogue  I HATE dialogue that relies on  blah blah blah  she replied   Meh Meh Meh   He contradicted  sarcastically    lazy  lazy  lazy and in SOOOO much fiction  Hawkins  None of this  I counted only one or two  he said    she saids   And what that gives you is the author s voice not interfering with what s going on  you feel the scene  feel the characters and for this  Paula Hawkins  I applaud you What else  The frailty of the human condition      not many will like Rachel  many will pull their hair out at the things she does     but anyone who s known pain and has ever developed a pattern of drinking  will taste the possibility of being Rachel and that s where the genius lies  You shouldn t relate to her character  but somehow you do  You want her to move on with her life  yet understand that she can t and for better or worse  probably worse  she won t  And I wanted so desperately to see where that led her Very few books make me forget my surroundings  this one did Ah yes  and pacing  You know those books where it takes four pages for someone to relay an unimportant experience and then the pivotal point happens in just one paragraph and you are left disorientated and out of reading rhythm      none of that with this book  it s genuinely one of the most skilfully paced books I ve read And lastly     dialogue realism  Have you every read those books where either each character talks in the same way   that s really just the author s voice   or they talk as ridiculous caricatures   Officer Maloney  pass me another donut    well     every word of dialogue in this book was believable and that s a MASSIVE achievement  Oh  I could go on  but who wants to read a thousand word review A message to Paula Hawkins  don t be a Harper Lee   Write more books    but don t rush them for a multi book deal  we ll gladly wait for another piece of brilliance  Great easy read  Impossible to put down  I was hesitant to read it because  while I liked Gone Girl a lot  the ending still had me irritated  despite later realizing maybe that book actually needed to end like that   I think I liked this book more  It s faster paced and more twisted  Truly a great psycho thriller   I wasn t impressed with this book at first  I didn t care for Rachel and I thought it was just strange  However  I couldn t put it down and by the middle I was completely hooked  One of my favorites for sure  The  girl on the train  is Rachel  a daily commuter into London  Every morning she daydreams about the lives of the couples that she encounters through the train s window  Rolling past the backyards of one happy couple  she names them Jess and Jason and fantasizes about their relationship       until that one day she see Jess kissing another man  The story is told from 3 perspectives  Rachel  divorced and unable to control her drinking  Megan  aka Jess  and Anna  Rachel s ex  Tom s new wife   Rachel has a history of drunken episodes that make it hard for her to determine fact or fiction  Like the train  the story is en route to a terrorizing and twisted ending  It sets into motion a chilling story that questions who can you trust  Be ready to be obsessed with this book  it is a book you won t put down   Call it 4 5 stars rounded up to 5  because I haaaate flashback epilogue endings  even though I understand why the author and editor made that choice  because of the last minute twist  I still feel like it could have been done a different way This book is frequently compared to Gone Girl  but while they have similar plot elements  the disappearance of a beautiful woman   themes  impact of misogyny  the way media frenzy can distort the truth  unreliable perception of other people  and structural elements  multiple unreliable narrators   the impact to which these elements are put is very different  Gone Girl is a darkly indulgent thriller  much of the appeal of Amy is the element of power fantasy  When I want nothing so much as to scream at a guy for being an oblivious douchebag  but know that everything I have to say will be dismissed as my being too sensitive  Amy says   You know all of those stupid oblivious things that men do  and that according to sitcoms and society  women are just supposed to respond to with an exasperated sigh and then go clean up the mess  Actually  it s not OK  It was never OK  And now I m going to use the comparatively few powers and privileges that I have as a woman  and fuck your shit up  In contrast  The Girl on the Train is tragic and suspenseful  The internalized misogyny of the three narrators that keeps them from taking power over their own lives  The disrespect that they accept without question  or rather  by questioning themselves rather than the men who dole it out  That when they do start to question  to act like adults instead of children  to meet the men on equal ground  they are attacked  That Megan is murdered in the process of trying to be a better person  and Rachel very nearly so  That they were attacked by the same men  That they will never be able to commiserate  The only part of The Girl on the Train which could be called indulgent is the ending  and I really can t blame it for that    by then  I was cheering with every blow that Rachel landed There is a ton to unpack in both books  so much that I could easily write a book analyzing each separately  and then comparing them to each other  I am definitely getting a physical copy of this one  although the audiobook is truly excellent  Every character in this book is both awful and good in their own right   Mostly  They re all nuanced and interesting The base plot is a thriller told from a few different perspectives  and that on it s own is wonderful  That would be enough to make this a great novel  In addition  the author does a great job of not wrapping it up too quickly  She draws it out in a way that doesn t feel drawn out  so you slowly start to come to the correct conclusion yourself  but you always have a little doubt What makes this book PHENOMENAL is the character study on three different perspectives of women involved in relationships  the examination of healthy and unhealthy activities in those relationships  and the ways in which we deal with those issues  The description of the feelings from the perspectives of two of the main characters was so compelling that I found myself almost crying in empathy  Hawkins has definitely been cheated on and at a minimum has the perspective of the woman who came along afterward  She really hit home on those emotions and some of the behaviors that go along with them All alongside a thriller that keeps you guessing throughout the story   I m so glad I bought this book  The writing style flowed so well and easily drew me into the story  It was so interesting how all the characters had their dark secrets  About 75  of the way through I developed a theory on the killer and BAM I was right  I couldn t stop turning the pages of this book  Very fast paced and I recommend it   At the start I was quite unimpressed with this novel  It was depressing on more levels than I could initially contemplate  but as I continued reading I realized that whereas I am normally really good at discerning where a novel is headed    This one had me perplexed  I couldn t get a fix on what exactly the author was trying to lead me into  and I think that is what I liked most about this novel  Towards the end I began to put the pieces of the puzzle together  and with most novels that is about the time that I start to become bored  not in this instance  Instead  I kept turning the pages  because I was drawn into the how the end would unravel  I would recommend this novel to anyone that isn t afraid of the human condition  and all the depravities that humans are capable of  If you are overly judgmental  and hold yourself above all others I am sure you will not enjoy this rather exciting breakthrough novel from Paula Hawkins   this book was amazing made you really think  loved it  Ame extremadamente este libro Una amiga que leyo el libro primero que yo me dijo que no estaba tan bueno y que recien se pone interesante las 100 ultimas paginas de las 491 que son  Por lo tanto me bajo todas la expectativas pero cuando yo comenzo a leerlo me atrapo desde la primera pagina y no hubo ni una sola parte en la que el libro me aburriera No espere ese final  pense en todos los personajes para ver quien era el asesino pero nunca se me paso por la cabeza que fuera ese personaje Ahora los personajes Anna me cayo muy mal desde que la mencionaron  Megan no me cayo mal hasta que paso lo que paso a la mitad del libro  y por ultimo Rachel  Rachel me cayo bien no la odie pero tampoco la ame  When I read Gone Girl  I was constantly waiting for the moment that everyone kept talking about     the big twist   With this book  I wasn t waiting  I was in a perpetual state of blissful suspense and even when I thought I might have an idea of what was going on  I was never completely confident  It was fun to read  It was easy to read  I sacrificed sleep and being on time to just about everything over the course of the week it took me to read this  very quick for me since I m such a slow reader  to read this book  I loved that it was told from three different points of view    the three women  Rachel  the main character  and then Anna and Megan  as well  The book centers on Rachel  a sad  middle aged  alcoholic divorcee who won t stop following her ex husband around  She takes the train every day  passing a house where she always sees a couple that seems to be perfect  She names them Jess and Jason and assumes she knows them  She assumes they re perfect and have it all  She makes up a whole life for them  never expecting that their worlds would come together  And then Jess    really named Megan Hipwell    goes missing  and Rachel knows that she had been in her town  following her ex husband  Tom  around  that same night  But she d been blackout drunk and doesn t remember anything  Or does she  Suddenly she finds herself trying to help Jason  Scott Hipwell  prove his innocence solely based on what she s seen from the train  The problem is that the police know she s an alcoholic and so does everyone else  They all dismiss her  Over the course of the book  Rachel battles herself and her own demons  but more and more is revealed about all three of their pasts and how their presents are all entwined  The end was not what I expected  It wasn t completely shocking  but it wasn t what I expected it to be  I was pleasantly surprised  She kept me on my toes like that  I had very few true criticisms of this book  After considering those that I did have for a bit  it occurred to me that they were done intentionally to throw the reader off  I can t say more without giving major plot points away   Some parts are intentionally left vague so as to not be so neatly packaged because real life wouldn t be that way  It was very enjoyable and I can t wait to see what else Paula Hawkins has in store   A very subtle mystery  No gore  no heavy drama  no blood bath but a very spine chilling psychological mystery nonetheless  It s no surprise this won the year s Best Psychological Thriller award  Alcoholic Rachel rides the train everyday into London and then back home often with a cocktail or two  On this daily journey  Rachel encounters the neighborhood where she used to live  and as she peers inside she imagines the lives of the occupants  In particular  Rachel becomes enamored with a couple that she considers perfect  until sudden they aren t  With the disappearance of the wife from Rachel s idealized pairing  Rachel is suddenly drawn back into a world that she was pulled from and perhaps didn t want to leave  As Rachel gets drawn further and further in  secrets are revealed and pasts are uncovered  But can Rachel handle the truth  And can she figure it out before it s too late Alternating between Rachel  the missing Megan  and Anna  current wife of Rachel s ex husband   this book is what thrill loving readers have been seeking  This gripping novel is what readers crave from suspense writers  Hawkins is an excellent writer who reveals just enough to keep the mystery alive until the the final pages  Bit by bit  as the enigma unravels  readers are left to grapple with the unreliability of memories and how we recognize who and what people truly are  Hawkins weaves a tale that is not to be missed   Ten stars  To say this book is excellent is an understatement  At the center there is Rachel  an alcoholic  unemployed  fat  divorced   total loser  continually harasses her ex husband  She takes train rides and has an amnesia issue  One day she saw something odd but cannot remember exact details  Megan  a married woman  gets murdered  Rachel feels attraction toward Megan s husband  In part  because she saw Megan kissing another man  Rachel goes to the police and the story steam rolls  I was engrossed in the story and kept reading  not because I wanted to know who the killer was  I did not care about who the killer was  I was captivated by the quality of writing  I liked the main character  Rachel  not sure why  Maybe since she does not blame someone else for her misery   borrowed  hardcopy  library The Hitchcockian title  The Girl on the Train  by Paula Hawkins  tells you so little of what you need to know and yet everything  this book is a chock full of fuck  Told through the eyes of three women  Rachel  Anna and Megan  Hawkins takes you down on a winding path of pathos  unfulfilled lives  and the compromise of aging  The heart of the book is the extraordinarily unreliable narrator  Rachel  who is in her word   Not the girl I used to be   She s lost that joi de vivre that propelled her through her 20 s  now she s on the other side of 40  divorced  unemployed  and a drunk  Still  she s not without a need for structure  she takes the train to London everyday  as if she had a job  if only not to rouse suspicion from her flatmate Cathy  And on her train ride  everyday  she passes the small town she lived in with her now ex husband  Tom  Over the course of her illegitimate commute  she s become taken with a couple who lives across the train tracks  creating a whole fantasy life of who they are  and the love they share  Rachel revels in the seduction of a daydream as much as she indulges in her drink  The female of the fantasy couple is Megan  who goes missing  well  she s murdered   which sends Rachel on a Nancy Drew tailspin  And then there is Anna  who lives a few doors away from Megan  resents the sad sack ex wife  even though it was Anna who was the other woman  Anna s whole world revolves around her perfect baby and her perfect husband and the perfect home they live in  even though  it was the same house Tom lived with Rachel in   I was white knuckling it as I tried to sort through Rachel s need to feel vital  Megan s need for adventure and Anna s need for the perfect life as Hawkins seamlessly thread their way in and around what really happened to Megan Finished 2 18 15 Great book     This was a tremendous mystery  the characters were captivating and the story was transformed  Anyone who has ever commuted on train will loves it for the simple premise that the story in part emerges from creating a story just about the people we see in passing on a commute  and who has not imagined what those people who we never really interact with might be like  One of the best psychological thrillers I read recently  I was wowed hroughout the book  except for a few pages in the middle when I started thinking   Oh  now I will have to give it 4 stars   But then things began to warm up  I just fell in love with the English countryside background  Ashbury   Rachel  the 30 something jobless  alcoholic lady who is trying to redeem herself and failing at each attempt  but never giving up hope  Anna  who is chronically stressed out and insecure about her husband  infant daughter and everything else  and Megan  the deeply dysfunctional home maker  who is very unstable  The story is narrated as a POV of these 3 ladies  The male characters include Tom  the husband of Anna and also the ex husband of Rachel  Scott  Megan s husband  and a red haired stranger  whose name I forgot  Cathy is Rachel s ever suffering housemate and hostess  who is the sometimes the stable backbone Rachel needs  I loved the various POVs  the various emotions  deceits and interactions  Loved the description of houses  places  train journey etc  If this book ever gets into this year s GR choice awards  I am gonna vote for it  I loved this book  It was a new breed of thriller that I enjoyed every page of  I think at first I expected something else but I loved the way the book developed and I would definitely recommend this   this was a good book  it took me a little bit to get into it but once I did I liked it  I closed my curtains  curled in bed and was swallowed by the story  English language gives some kind of magic features to the books I read I gave it 5 stars even though the plot is pretty simple and predictable I gave it 5 stars even though heroes are messed up and very depressing I gave it 5 starts even though there are some other weak points However  I don t understand when people start to abuse each other and blame in not being a  good reader   spoiling Goodreads books  ratings  Everything is related and nobody is forcing anybody to read what all people read  Everybody knows that a mainstream stuff is usually not the best quality  Why do you need to read it and then educate others about it Let here rest an additional 5 star rating I gave it 5 stars because the scene takes place on the outskirts of London  It has always been a place of mystery for me from all of the books I read about it before I gave it 5 stars because it is written from 3 different women s perspectives  It helpes to imagine places and events better  as if you are watching a movie and camera circles around  going from one person to another I gave it 5 starts because each of us can relate to any of the characters  We are not professional critics and or literature reviewers  We are common people who do not need much to get something from the book  It has to be realistic and based on our true feelings and emotions You know how it is when you idealize your partners friends and after you break up you re finally able to see all of the weak and negative points of their personalities You know how it is when you lie somebody to look better in their eyes  but eventually you are stuck in the mud you created and you cannot get rid of it You know how it is to sneak on somebody and be able to find evidence of their betrayals You know how it is to feel sick when you re drunk and not be able to finish with it even if it makes you feel bad You know how it is when you made a wrong step and you cannot stop all of the outcomes You know how it is when you cannot trust anybody The story is connected with our lives in all dimension Why should only high masterpieces  elevating and educational stories get credit Why the book about our every day life  written in a simple manner  trust issues  madness  depression  arguments  treachery  etc  cannot be a masterpiece It made me think a lot and I am sure that it is the main goal any book has to accomplish  Rachel Watson rides the train every day to her non existent job outside London  Recently divorced  her husband cheated  depressed  and an alcoholic  she continues this ruse so her landlady won t know she was fired from her job  Rachel s husband is now married to his mistress  Anna  and they have a baby  adding to Rachel s misery  Each day the train passes her former home  as well as the home of an apparently loving couple whom Rachel has assigned fictional names  When Rachel sees something from the train window that shocks her  and when later the female she has observed goes missing  Rachel decides to go the police  Unfortunately Rachel is not considered a reliable witness  The story unfolds in the voices of Rachel  Anna  and Megan  the missing lady   and as the suspense builds  nothing is as it seems  This is a real page turner  well written and plotted  The ending was surprising but satisfying  A good page turner  a good story  I d picked it up months ago and in the beginning I couldn t get into it  Because all my friends were raving about the book and I knew the movie was coming out  I decided to give it another go and I m very glad that I did  The author fleshes out every character so you feel as though you know them  You don t of course  and therein lies the tale that entices you to keep reading until you get to the end The last few chapters will leave you breathless  I just finished it  I don t write many reviews  although I read a lot of books  it s 1 20 am and I hope I can fall asleep tonight  After the very satisfying ending  I know this book will stay with me a long time    One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl  four for a boy  five for silver  six for gold  seven for a secret never to be told  Let me just say that this has been a very     ummm  crappy and enlightening birthday  So the highlight of my day was finishing this book  I don t read many adult crime type novels  They have to be some kind of strange  weird  out of the ordinary  psychological thriller  fucked up  type of thing for me to read them  So when people associated this with Gone Girl  I was immediately intrigued  because I love that book  So of course I had to give it a shot I loved this book  I love how absolutely terrible everyone is  each in their won way  and no one is entirely likable  though some you just feel sorry for   Its gritty  sleazy  fast paced  gruesome at times  sad  and just totally crazy  One thing that really pulled me in at the beginning was being in Rachael and Megan s heads  It reminded me slightly at times  of being in Esther s head in The Bell Jar  They are just messed up  in different ways of course  but it felt familiar  Then the author referenced Sylvia Plaths life and blew my mind   I think about Ted Hughes  moving Assia Wevill into the home he d shared with Plath  of her wearing Sylvia s clothes  brushing her hair with the same brush  I want to ring Anna up and remind her that Assia ended up with her head in the oven  just like Sylvia did  Literally all of the relevant people in this book have issues  I felt the most bad for Rachael  and she tried so hard to be good  I even liked Megan  for a minute  Anna  good grief she is on my list of top most hated characters  SO full of herself  Such a bitch  Then men  well     ugh  I also love the way the story played out  starting at different times  and then lining up in the end  I like the different POV s too  it really helped the story  I remember the exact moment I had a guess as to the bad guy   view spoiler  when Megan said she saw a cars headlights  and he smiled at her  I immediately thought Tom  lol  hide spoiler   and I ended up right  but that didn t change that I loved the story and how we got there   I don t know  I don t know where my strength went  I don t remember losing it  I think that over time it got chipped away  bit by bit  by life  by the living of it  There is sad  depressing  sleazy  messed up stuff going on here  and it made for one hell of a book  I think I definitely loved this more than Gone Girl  and I have to say I don t exactly entirely see why the comparison is there anyway  To me  they are very different  I like to believe that if Sylvia Plath wrote a psychological thriller  it would be like this  That is a huge compliment to the author  I cant wait to read more by her  I definitely recommend this one    A mystery so thrilling  it will leave your head spinning  Rachel has lost it all  her husband  her job  her hopes of children  and maybe even her sanity  In order to avoid conflicts with her flatmate  she continues to take the morning train into London to  go to work   It is on this regular commute that Rachel gets to know Jess and Justin It isn t until a particularly hungover morning that Rachel realizes things are getting worse for her  She blacked out again last night and can t quite remember why her clothes were dirty or how she had gotten the cut on her head  Then she realizes that Megan  Jess  is missing  And there are so many similarities between Megan s disappearance and the flashes of nightmare memory that Rachel is experiencing  Is there something Rachel is missing  just out of the grasp of her memory  Is there something she should be apologizing for   or worse  going to the police about The twists and turns of this plot will be leaving you dizzy and second guessing your every prediction  I m still shaking  1000 stars  The final    was an explosion in my head  everything happened faster and faster    If you are looking for a great contemporary mystery  this is it  Thoroughly enjoyed this  Score  9 10  If you haven t read it   read it now I can t say much about the story for fear of giving away any spoilers  but I was hooked from start to finish  It was a tense  often heartbreaking and emotional read  Definitely one of the best audio books I ve listened to in a while  all the narrators did a perfect job of bringing something extra to a great story  Fast reading  Well done  Often would have to check on the dates of when things happened  But loved the writing and character development  Would definitely read more from his author  Recommend reading  Just as twisty and unexpected as Gone Girl  Well  well  well  What a book  The writing style wasn t perfect and there were a few mistakes here and there but what a story  This is my first ever review on a book so that just goes to show how brilliant I thought it was  This storyline had me hooked from the very beginning and had me thinking 24 7 about the possibilities with the characters   Who did this  Who did that  Why would he she do that   Were questions I often asked myself  While this book may have had some issues with the writing style  it was easy to forget once the storyline kicked into gear  This book  for me  definitely deserves the 5 5 I gave it  I have recommended it to my friends and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new read   It s all most midnight for me but I hope this all makes sense to you guys   Was on my list  and by sheer luck  a friend loaned me a copy and I read half of it on a flight out to the other coast and then finished it on the red eye back  Needless to say  the book s narrative and the story had my interest going  and I read it on the kindle  so that also adds to the fact that it was gripping  The narration  the characters and the storyline  the way it zigged and zagged between perspectives and views of some times the same scenarios  One feels empathy  sympathy and helplessness for each of the characters as they are dragged through the single day s nightmarish ordeal  and how each are sucked into it  A great narrative that is not your usual  and despite a fairly ogical and straightforwrd ending  says a lot about the writer to eb able to keep the interest  Highly recommend   gahhhh this book was absolutely amazing    Best  most entertaining book I ve read in a few years  I enjoyed every single page of this book  in my opinion the story is outstanding  And hey  this is the author s first thriller  I think she did a great job and can t wait to read her next book What can I say about Rachel  the main character and one of the narrators of the book   Well  I hated her throughout the story but I couldn t stop reading what she had to say  She s so spontaneous  so stupid  so stubborn  but so human  Her speciality is getting into trouble and this was the thing I both  hated and liked about her at the same time  What about the rest of the characters   Well developed by the author and  oh my god  I wouldn t like to have their lives A must read if you like thrillers  female narrators and stupid   in kind of a silly but a good way   you ll understand this when you read the book   main character  2015 has only just begun  and already we may have one of the year s best suspense novels on our hands  This book follows Rachel  an alcoholic who has developed a fantasy life in her head for an attractive couple she sees in their home from her commuter train every day  When the wife of said couple goes missing  she can t help but involve herself in the mystery  which rather unsurprisingly winds up further complicating her life  The story moves back and forth in time  and is told from the perspectives of Rachel  her ex husband s new wife Anna  and the missing woman Megan  who Rachel initially refers to as Jess in her fantasy   No one in the story seems to be trustworthy  as they all hide information and or outright lie to each other in order to achieve their goals  which makes getting to the bottom of things that much more challenging for everyone  including the reader  Despite all the characters being heavily flawed  most of them come across sympathetically  which helps one actually care about their fates  Rachel in particular is well fleshed out  and comes the closest to being outright likable  which is quite a feat considering how unbalanced she is  The plot moves along at a very brisk pace and builds up to such a suspenseful conclusion that it is a hard book to put down  It may be a little dark for some people s tastes  but I found it to be one of the most entertaining books I ve read in a long time  I told myself I d review every book I read this year   so here goes me I really enjoyed this  It was a very smooth read from start to finish  and at no point did I find myself frustrated or bored  the way I usually inevitably feel when reading almost any book  which is odd  since none of the characters in the book were very likeable to begin with   view spoiler   Except  funnily enough  Tom  I remember thinking to myself near the start  after almost all of the characters have been introduced  that Tom s the only character who seems remotely likeable  Which  i suppose  is a testament to the quality of writing   I was convinced he was a good guy  I even came to see him as a victim  pushed into adultery by his drunk hot mess of a wife  Hah  Kudos  Paula Hawkins   hide spoiler    Usually when this happens I tend to lose interest since there is no one to root for when you pretty much dislike everyone  but The Girl on the Train was so well paced and gripping that the plot took over  overshadowed the flaws of the characters  and it didn t really matter that I didn t like these people  I just wanted to know  with the same burning curiosity that Rachel had  what exactly had happened  I did figure it out just before the book confirmed it  but by no means was this novel predictable  In fact  before I put the pieces together I never knew what was going to happen on the next page flip or chapter  and I was happy enough to let the book take me on the ride  It was only past a certain point where all of the pieces had been presented that it finally clicked together for me  I had put the book down to hop in the shower  and aren t showers just great places to have striking realisations midway through a compelling read  It was a gleeful journey to the end of the book after that as I checked if I had got it right  I did feel sorry for Rachel a few times in the book  but mostly I was irritated and convinced that she was unstable and crazy  I felt nothing for Megan and I absolutely hated Anna  They were all fantastically portrayed  Convincing  I admit I had to go back and forth a few times to check the dates  and MAN is that a bitch to do on a kindle   but that s mostly because I didn t pay enough attention to the dates in the first place   I have a bit of ADHD  but I don t imagine it d really be that hard to keep up with  I can see the similarity to Gone Girl  and why people would compare this to that  but I frankly did not enjoy Gone Girl that much  The Girl on the Train was a much  much more enjoyable read  The pacing of the book is what stood out to me  336 pages was the perfect length  Gone Girl s 560 pages had me feeling almost physically exhausted by the end  tired of the batshit crazy of it all  But this  this was fun  I didn t want to put it down after I really got into the swing of it  determined to finish it even as my eyes were closing and dawn was approaching  Eventually I had to admit defeat but the second I woke up I was reading again  A gripping and fantastic read  Pick it up  Enjoy the ride   This is a psychological thriller  which interweaves the POVs of three women    Rachel  Megan  and Anna    into an evolving murder mystery  I understand the comparisons to Gone Girl  but Girl on the Train has a more ambitious structure  It s populist  sure  but I ve read a lot of  best sellers  that were nowhere near as enjoyable and readable as this  I would give it very high marks  If I could offer any negative criticisms  I might say that I wish there was more about Anna  more POV from other characters like the police  Rachel s flat mate  and the red haired man  and that there were a few more likable characters added  to offset the darkness  But I was undeniably drawn to Rachel  I could relate to her so well that I found myself forgiving her faults  and rooting for her to  somehow  win  I was in tears by page three  And adding more might spoil the structure  which is very well crafted  I look forward to much more from this author  This book  Ohmygod  I literally could not put down  I thought it would take me 4 days to read  I finished it in 1 1 2  It was that good  Gripping  tragic  and emotional  this book was a bomb  in the good way   I have low expectations for new adult novels  because let s be real  YA for the win  But seriously  this surprised and boggled me  I went in thinking it would be a contemporary novel  but it was so much more  It s mystery  horror  terror  and more wrapped into one book  I just loved the writing style and story line  I mean  I get why everyone was saying bad stuff about the book  Like yeah  there were no  good  characters  They were all hot messes  But I think that just makes the story better  Like what other book have you read with so many strong  negative characters  It was a new type of story  filled with antagonists   I think the best thing I liked about this book was the surprises  It starts off from the perspectives of two girls  And then three  The perspectives talk about their lives  They all live depressing lives  There s nothing in common with these girls except for the fact that they live sad lives and have been hurt in some way  They are all mentally unstable depressed people  We keep reading and we start to enjoy the book  But then you start to think   HOW is it related  Because it s hard to join these stories  But then BAM  The author connects all these stories and we realize that they aren t 3 stories  it s one story told from different sides  I loved how the author took a small thing like what she sees on the train  and somehow connected it all  Like Jess and Jason were Megan and Scott  I never saw that coming  And Todd was cheating AGAIN  And Megan killed her child  And Scott was violent too  Like lets just say  this book is INTENSE  My god  there were so many twists and turns  It was a dark  dark  dark   gloomy book  But I loved it  and I don t even like mysteries   Don t try to solve the mystery as you read because you will never solve it  It was like BOOM BOOM BOOM  I m breathless after reading this  Nobody in this story is how they seem  Except Evie  But I have a feeling she ll grow up traumatized although she won t remember what happened   Truly a mystery from beginning to end  I didn t know how it was going to go    Great read  This book DEFINITELY lived up to what everyone said  It was so good  If you liked Gone Girl  this book has as many twists and turns  AHHH SOO GOOD  Tt s a British mysteryAt first I didn t think I really liked the story  I got bogged down with not liking the main character and her drinking and feeling sorry for herselfRachel is divorced from Tom  Tom had an affair with Anna and is now married to Anna and they have a baby   and they all live happily in the house where Rachel used to live  Rachel drinks every day  gets really drunk every day  and calls Tom all of the time  She has lost her job  but she rides the train every day to London so that her roommate believes she still has a job  The train takes her past her old house As she passes by the house   she looks at her old neighborhood  She sees a couple who live a few doors down from her old house  She makes up about them  A loving couple  madly in love  Then one day she sees the wife kissing another man   and then the wife goes missing  She becomes obsessed with telling the husband what she saw from the train  She was in the village that night  really drunk   and in a blackout   but she has pieces of a memory    A really good story An intricately crafted glimpse of a character tethered loosely to life  a world shattered and skewed by odds normally conceived as surmountable  an everyday type tragedy that ordinary people face and overcome daily  but  The Girl On The Train  cannot  she cannot rise above the ache of her divorce  she cannot find courage  she cannot move on  This portrait of suffering is so richly developed in this tale  so poignantly embroidered that the raw pain of rejection etches the pages as if scalded by a hot needle drawn across tender skin  The protagonist is not even likable  but she is  nevertheless  irresistible because the author so cleverly yanks pieces of every reader and tosses them into the traits of this anti heroine until she becomes utterly personal  we ve all felt her angst  if not as keenly  Rachel is an ugly drunk  she sneaks canned gin and tonic onto the morning train  she abuses her best friend s hospitality and she is winding herself into the knot of homeless vagrant at speed  She fumbles  falls and creates chaos wherever she goes  she also lives in a uniquely conjured imaginary world   she devises a fantasy existence for a couple she often spies from the solitary window of her commuter train compartment  She names the couple  emotes unrealistic affection at them  and believes they fit her ideal of what love is meant to be  Cunningly  this couple lives only doors away from her ex and his new lady love and cherub toddler  Ah what a setting  so filled with the possibility of destructive force  Yes  force  an entire vortex of swirling mayhem sprinkled to glitter the scene and tantalize the reader The author not only masters the sense of intrigue brilliantly  but she peppers it with eloquent descriptions of location  environment and the protagonist s state of mind  This aspect is so subtly handled that the scene is lodged in the reader s mind as if by magic  the reader is pulled into the story with all senses tingling  aroma  hue  shade and drama are brushed in at ever layer  This is an accomplished dramatist  and the thrill of the technique will keep the reader flipping the pages well into the night The story rotates around a sighting Rachel makes of her dream girl that shocks her and pushes her into the reality of her make believe couple  she has information that could solve a crime  and suddenly she acquires a personality  she starts to shape up and  fix  herself  This is the true fulcrum of the tale  the turning point that puts the reader on Rachel s side  prompts the reader to  root  for her and  like  her Ultimately the thriller aspect  for me at least  takes a backseat to the character development and the emotional see saw ride created by the shifting emotions in the story  the whodunit aspect becomes less important  there is a whole book to read rather than only a climax to tie up the story  I enjoyed reading it immensely even if I imagined it would end differently   This is one of the best murder mysteries I ve read  The comparisons to Gone Girl were accurate  I ve been trying to find more suspenseful  well crafted books like this one with several female viewpoints  This is quite a hard book to review for one reason only  It s comparison to Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl  Put simply it is nothing like it really  Gone Girl is to this day one of the creepiest books I ever read  surpassed only by One of Flynn s other novels Sharp Objects  Nobody can write like Flynn for her levels of creepiness and thrilling writing  But did it make this boom bad because it wasn t Gone Girl  No  It was still a great book  still an interesting read with a very impressive amount of red herrings thrown in that kept me guessing until very near the end  I still enjoyed it very much I would still recommend it to other thriller and crime fans it is still a very impressive novel and deserves its 5  rating  the ending could be described as flat but it is sort of what you come to expect as a thrillers ending not many of them end up in a way that surprises you  I think that it has been unfortunate that this book has been associated with Gone Girl simply for the reason that it made its readers expect far more of it than what it is and lost it the praise it deserved as a novel in its own right   What a thrilling read  It takes quite the page turner to get me to finish a novel in one day  Paula Hawkins was quite clever in her crafting of the the main character females  The three of them encompass so many character flaws that I think it would be next to impossible for any woman not to relate to them in some way  I know I certainly identified with many of their flaws  And  when I relate to the characters I enjoy the story much more completely I agree with other reviewers that the end of the book seemed a little bit forced  The plot starts out actually quite believable  and ends up spiraling into quite an unbelievable tale by the end of the book  But  that s what makes this a thrilling read and not boring  realistic drivel If you haven t yet  read it  A really gripping thriller told from the perspective of three women  One of the woman is murdered and it s about trying to figure out who did it  I didn t guess until the reveal and thought it was a really good ending  The story is told almost like diary entries but it s trying to mimic the train commute so you get the story in  morning  and  evening  sections  I did struggle to get in to the very first part of the book but after 30 pages or so I was hooked   Let me just preface this by saying that this book really is nothing like Gone Girl  I  for one  found Gone Girl to move way too slowly and couldn t bring myself to finish it   Yes  The Girl on the Train may have progressed slowly towards the beginning  but I feel that enough was revealed to make you want to keep reading  Another thing that keeps getting brought up is that none of the characters are likeable  but I think that s what makes it so captivating  The moment you begin to think you have it all figured out  something crazy happens and you re back at square one  I honestly didn t put the pieces together until the last few pages  chapters and that s exactly how it should be   Very clever novel  switching perspectives between three women whose lives are intertwined and who are very similar  though they do not know it  Beginning from the perspective of Rachel who watches two homes along the tracks while commuting to London  like a voyeur  the novel speeds through flashbacks of the prior day after whatever events have occurred  It s all an interesting way to tell a story  and keeps you moving forward  The writing is amazing  hats off to Hawkins for consistently smooth  clean prose  which always moves and never feels stale or repetitive   A great read for those that love a thrilling unexpected ending while keeping you on the edge wanting more   This is one of those books that consumes your weekend and  when you raise your head from the final page  leaves you a little breathless and dazed  I loved it I loved the way Paula Hawkins gets under the skin of her female characters  how she knows what is is to be the sad alcoholic  the scheming second wife  the broken girl  Because that s what writing is all about  isn t it  The voyeuristic glimpses into the lives of other people and trying to understand what makes them behave as they do  And the  there but for the grace of God       Do damn good   I am giving this 5 stars because as a first book  it is remarkable  Even if this weren t her first book  it would be remarkable  Hawkins crafted this book with three narrators  the present and the past and veiled identities so well  I didn t guess the culprit till the very end  She even made me dislike the protagonist  I wanted to just feel sorry for her  but she was so pathetic my sympathy turned to loathing  I could not put this book down  An outstanding thriller  I highly recommend it  I really  really enjoyed this book  It took me a bit to get the hang of the different POVs  most especially because the dates were not linear  I had to keep flipping back and forth to be certain where in the narrative I was  That s not a complaint  I m fine with a novel that requires a bit of effort on my part I know this has been compared to Gone Girl  and as much as I hate to jump on the bandwagon  I have to agree  Hawkins keeps you guessing  In the beginning you are lost  but really  each time you think you ve figured out where you are   you re wrong  I d like to think I cottoned to Tom s lies soon  but I ll never know for sure unless I compare the page I figured that out with another reader I feel the end was a mild disappointment  Not enough to delete any stars  obviously  but I think she could have done a bit better  I will be watching for her other books  I don t even know if this is her first  but I ll be checking as soon as I finish this and if it isn t  I ll be scooping them up  Ooh my god   That is my only reaction after reading this thrilling read  I started it yesterday  and finished it today  This is clear enough to show all you readers out there that this is one book you do not want to miss out Rachel kept me grilled enough and my adrenaline coursed through my veins  I hated  hated Anna for what she was and felt like killing Tom  for the big jerk and asshole he is portrait as Megan though  is one complex character which shows how psyche of women  and by that I mean  the modern day working women works as  We are exposed to so many things around us that it is hard to comprehend with both the genders choices these days   No spoiler here  though  Please  do not stop in the mid even if a book does not interest you or is not your cup of tea Respect the authors hard work Oone commendable piece of fiction by Paula Hawkins Kudos to you mam Although it took a minute to get used to the alternating chapters  the author had me hooked from the beginning  The number of twists and turns through the plot were written in an extremely engaging manner  This is the type of book that is hard to put down  Hawkins creates a gripping who dunnit novel that is dripping in sneaky clues hidden beneath the surface of the text  The multiple narrations give the reader a history into the faults of the three main females  Rachel  Anna and Megan  For anyone that has been betrayed by an ex lover  Rachel is the perfect embodiment of everything wrong about bad break ups  She is an alcoholic who stalks her ex husband  whilst doing this she witnesses mysterious events taking place on her old street that she passes every day  but as such an unreliable narrator with black outs in place where there should be memories  can she really be trusted  Hawkins creates such wonderful back stories for these characters that you really begin to feel like you know them  She makes you feel happy for one character at the start of the novel and then hate them towards the middle  Hawkins has created a masterpiece of a crime thriller  the ending could have reached out and slapped me in the face it was that unexpected  If you want to have sleepless nights  then read The Girl on the Train   I would actually give this 4 5 stars but of course I can t  This was such an engrossing and riveting book  It had me intrigued until the very end  It was so hard to put down  I don t know what it is but I am always interested in books about trains  I think I can blame  Murder on the Orient Express  for that and this book did not disappoint  And it had such a creepy edge to it  but not in an awkward off   putting way  I could say this book as a definite movie  it was such a good thriller  Unfortunately  the only person who could truly bring it to the big screen and give it its proper justice  would be Alfred Hitchcock  This book just wreaks of Hitchcock  Litteraturpolitiet burde have grebet ind og hindret udgivelsen af Paula Hawkins  Kvinden i toget   En debut som denne  vil i lang tid fremover fa alle andre debutromaner til at blegne langt ud over det rimelige Jeg kan ikke mindes hvornar jeg sidst har laest en bog der dels var sa spaendende  og dels sa vanvittigt velskrevet som denne  Jeg kan slet ikke fa armene ned igen  og har mattet klaebe tastaturet fast i loftet for at skrive denne anmeldelse Rachel tager hver morgen toget fra en londonforstad ind til London  og hver aften tager hun toget hjem igen  Det er flere maneder siden hun har mistet sit job pa grund af druk  men hun skammer sig ved at fortaelle det til veninden som hun er flyttet ind hos efter at hendes aegteskab ogsa rog sig en tur  Hver dag korer toget forbi det hus hun boede i sammen med sin mand Tom  Rachel folger med i livet hos et par der bor i samme gade  men et par huse laengere nede  Hun far korte glimt hver dag nar toget standser ved et defekt stopsignal  og hun fantaserer i alkoholtagerne om deres lykkelige liv  Men en dag ser hun noget  der kommer til at vende op og ned pa hendes liv   og pa adskillige andres  Problemet er bare  om hun kan stole pa det hun ser  og om andre kan stole pa hende  Om det er virkeligt  eller om det er hendes tagede hjerne der fortaeller hende ting Udover at skrive utroligt godt  har Paula Hawkins ogsa formaet at grave dybt ned i den menneskelige psyke  og beskrive hvad hun ser  Bogens karakterer udvikler sig for ojnene af laeseren  og vi bliver stille og roligt vidne til menneskers forfald  Der sker ting og sager undervejs  og det er et sporgsmal om hvem der gjorde hvad og hvornar  ligesom i alle andre spaendingsromaner  Det nye er  at disse sporgsmal bliver besvaret pa et eller andet teknisk plan   han gjorde det og det  sadan og sadan  Men da sidste side var vendt  vidste jeg hvem   og sa alligevel  For hvem er vi  og hvordan pavirker vi hinanden og vore respektive liv  Hvem er skyldig   og er der nogen uskyldige Er man til tju bang  masser af vold og blod  udpenslede sexscener og ensomme whiskypavirkede politimaend  skal man ga langt udenom  Kvinden i toget   Den har ingen af delene  Til gengaeld nar den helt derind  hvor det bliver rigtig uhyggeligt  Der hvor virkeligheden lurer lige om hjornet  og man bliver nodt til at traenge ned i sig selv  Det er sa vildt En fantastisk debut  og der er ikke noget at sige til at DreamWorks sikrede sig filmrettighederne allerede inden bogen udkom  eller at den indtil videre er udgivet i 44 lande  P t   oktober 2015  skriver Hawkins pa en ny thriller  Det kan kun ga galt  Med  Kvinden i toget  har hun sat barren sa hojt  at det bliver naesten umuligt ikke at sla hovedet imod den naeste gang Men jeg er helt sikkert klar nar hendes naeste vaerk udkommer  A gripping and fresh novel that had me on the edge of my seat for over four hours  It was brilliant  edgy  touched on real subjects and with the main character  Rachel  I couldn t help but root for her  Fantastically written in a style I ve come to love and with the alternating POV s  I was entertained  And when the twist was delivered  I shouted out   I bloody knew it   even though I didn t want to believe it  Overall a tremendous job and I can t wait to read more from Paula Hawkins   One of the best books I ve read in a long time  If you enjoyed Gone Girl you ll love it more  Yup  A must read keep you up too late kinda book Outstanding Read   I was personally recommended this book by a coworker and man am I glad that she recommended it  It is an amazing tale told from three different women s points of view  Rachel a battered  alcoholic who was left by her husband for another takes the train everyday and imagines made up lives of people who live on the stops of the train  Megan who suffers from guilt  anxiety and loss who tries to mask her pain in things she shouldn t  And Anna a wife and mother who is trying to deal with her husband s ex all the while trying to be the perfect mother and beautiful wife  Their stories intertwine and lead up to a Saturday night when a great mystery happens  Filled with suspense  mystery  death and what real life throws at us  The Girl on the Train  is an excellent novel     Couldn t put this down  Stayed up till 1 00am to finish it  It was good  sad  and weird all at the same time  I felt like the characters were true to life     Pathetic  confident  sad  confused  desperate     all of those characteristics and more  THIS BOOK IS SO GOOD  What Hawkins does with the role of a narrator   and how she plays with that   is phenomenal  Are they credible  Are they telling the truth about themselves  And then how she spins that around to hit us with    how credible are we as the narrators of our own stories and how much do we lie or bend the truth to serve our own narrative  Love how she weaponizes shame  How she really delves into taking responsibility for things and how powerful it is to make someone see the truth of themselves  Oh  it s so good   This reminded me of Happy Valley  If you like this  WATCH THAT    and everything Sally Wainwright does      I m giving this 5 stars because it s so well written  the characters are well drawn  and the mystery is well concealed  Because of the comparisons with Gone Girl I was tempted to think Megan wasn t dead  that is until they unearthed the body  Then with every twist and turn I questioned my guesses on who did it  I didn t rate it 5 stars because I liked the characters  in fact there wasn t really a likable character in the book  The author clearly views humans as seriously flawed individuals  The girl on the train being one of the most seriously flawed  I wanted to shake her   Awesome book  A terrific thriller that will keep you intrigued until the very end  I hope this author writes more great books like this   What a riveting read  I sped through it  utterly engrossed  I did guess who did it very early on but that didn t spoil my enjoyment in the least  It was so brilliantly twisty and Rachel was a fascinating character  The ending was hugely satisfying  This is a book that lives up to the hype that surrounds it  Highly recommended  I picked this book up at my local chapters  because it was the store s book club choice for the month and I decided I wanted to be a little more social this year  They sent me a quick bio of the book in my email and it sounded quite interesting  I was not disappointed  This book features Rachel who is a completely unreliable narrator having recently recently becoming separated from her husband and falling into alcoholism  Every day she looks out of the train at one couple on their patio  She imagines what they are like believing them to be the perfect couple  One day she sees something out the window that is startling and the next day the woman goes missing  Inserting herself into the investigation everything and everyone is suspect through the eyes of this unreliable narrator   including herself  It is extremely disconcerting not being able to trust the person who is walking you through a novel  The story is also told through the eyes of two other women neither of who are likeable  Despite none of the characters being loveable the story manages to bring the point home that nobody is perfect or what they may seem  The novel makes several poignant points about the fact that what may seem to be perfect from the outside may actually be anything but The novel also explores what it is to have struggles in your life and how you might overcome them  Rachel is a broken woman who is trying to make sense of a situation that is not what she would have wanted for herself  It comes from shared experience  from knowing how it feels to be broken   and  the holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them With plenty of plot twists and a great deal of tension this novel is a page turner  I recommend this to anyone who likes a good thriller or mystery  Really enjoyed this  Proper mystery with a dash of drama  I m a sucker for unreliable narrators and a cast of characters so awful you d change sidewalks if you met them in real life  and The Girl on the Train more than delivered on both scores  The prose is lovely and flows well despite the necessary narrative gaps  when you re dealing with a narrator who routinely blacks out  there are going to be sudden breaks in the stream of consciousness   The whodunit aspect  even once I realized there was something someone might have done  which isn t clear for about a third of the book  kept me guessing until the last few chapters  But in the spirit of Gone Girl  it doesn t really matter if you can figure out the key to the mystery  because even once the puzzle pieces are neatly laid out  there s still tension in the story  There s a lot about this that reminded me of Before I Go to Sleep   same unreliable narrator idea  same dubious cast of secondary characters all up to no good  The not so neat division between male violence and female enabling of said violence  The whole play on agency and manipulation is obviously something I like  so this very much hit the spot  Recommended   I loved this book  It was gripping  suspenseful and unlike some of the books I have read this one kept me guessing right until the end  Well written  engaging characters  Highly Recommend  Roman me je prijatno iznenadio  Mnogi su ga

Detaljan prikaz mozete da procitate ovde http   citymagazine rs clanak prikaz     I don t want to take the chance of giving anything away with this book  I just want to tell you to read it  It doesn t matter what type of genre you are into  you will enjoy this debut novel by a great new talent  I was sucked in immediately by Paula Hawkins use of words alone this is a finely crafted  well thought out story that keeps you wanting to know  what is going to happen next  I read the entire book in less than 24 hours  I just really could not put it down  I ve gone through passages of the book again already and you can see that all the details of what is to come is plainly laid out from the start of the novel  I cannot wait to read future books by Paula Hawkins   A page turner for sure  I couldn t put it down and it kept me guessing while on the edge of my seat  Excellent read  Best book I ve read in a long while  If you haven t read it  READ IT   Really good read  I love that I can t say   I knew it was         until I was almost done with this book  It was a hell of a ride for Rachel and Megan  Quite the page turner  Hard not to love this book   I really enjoyed this book  Suspenseful and addicting  I can t wait to see how the movie turns out  Hard to believe that  The Girl on the Train  is Paula Hawkin s first novel  Loved it and looking forward to reading more books by her  This murder mystery was terrific  It s told from the point of view of three different young women over the course of a few weeks  with flashbacks to a year earlier  The three women at first seem very different but as you continue to read you find how similar they are  It has lots of great plot twists and what seems like a very accurate depiction of what it s like to be an alcoholic  It was fabulous  one of my favorite fun reads  Rarely do the clues keep you guessing until pretty close to the end and Hawkins achieves just that  her characters are unique and the story had me unable to put the book down for any length of time  highly recommend as an engaging intriguing read  Every character in this book was a total mess and almost entirely unredeemable  with the exception of the main character  Rachel who  while a total mess and difficult to like  was at least not a completely terrible person   so if you need your books to be filled with likable characters  don t bother with The Girl on the Train  Despite that  I absolutely loved this book  There were a few points in the book where I was convinced the ending would be predictable and I knew what was going to happen  and I was always wrong  It was incredibly easy to get into  and within the first few pages I was hooked   An unreliable narrator witnesses something  She takes the train every day  allegedly to work  but at a job which is no longer hers  past her old home where her ex lives with his new wife and their baby  She constructs romantic stories of the lives of her former neighbor and sometimes exits the train to wander drunkenly up and down the street Something happens to her near her old home   But even a physical assault can be a confused occurrence which lacks connection to reality  The perfect couple in a house exactly like hers has issues  She sees something  Then that perfect wife goes missing  She has seen something  but cannot recount it accurately  Her drinking is out of control again This is a work of misogyny and murder  The women are driven apart and then together by their shared betrayal  It is a difficult read  and a book I put down several times only to be drawn back into its web  Even as it hurtles towards revelation  it remains dark  grim and confused  It will disturb you  It will frighten you  It will enlighten you as well   Now look  Now look what you made me do  A great psychological thriller with twist and turns reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock s best works  The narrators are 3 women who appear different but whose lives are linked in unexpected ways  This book has murder  mystery  and flawed characters whose behaviors can be frustrating to the reader until we get to know their histories  They are imperfect people trying to find a perfect life  Great character studies delve into how the mind perceives events and protects us in times of severe stress and trauma  While the main mystery may be solved by some readers  I liked that there were still a few surprises after the  end   Highly recommend  I loved this book  but in an odd way it also annoyed me  Let me try to explain  As someone who has had experience with alcoholics in the past  I found the portrayal of alcoholism to be hardly believable  Although this sort of experience may be the case for some  it made me have a much more difficult time relating to the character  I feel like I would have enjoyed it even more had there been less of an emphasis on her drinking   but that is of course a choice that the author made and it certainly didn t ruin the book for me  Other than this  I found this to be one of the best books I have read in a while  I read it over the course of a weekend and when I finished I had that post great book anxiety that I wouldn t enjoy the next book that I picked up because I enjoyed this one so much  If you want a book that s easy to read  full of surprises  and that you know everyone will be talking about for the next year  read this  I highly recommend it  For more reviews  insight  and conversation  check out  On twitter   tipsy_writerhttp   www tipsywriter comIf you would like for me to review your book on my site  please reach out to me and we can discuss options   I was very happy with this book  Saw it at the store and looked interesting  did not know what it was about but I knew I had to read it  Can t wait to see the movie   Wow  I didn t expect to like this so much but this is just so mysteriously different  Very reliable unreliable multiple POVs  I must say  There isn t a lot of action but it caught my full attention from page one   really enjoyed this one  halfway through i thought that i knew who did it but i was pleasantly surprised that i was wrong   Escribo esto mientras trato de recuperar el aliento  A pesar de que empieza un poco mas lento de lo que esperaba no tarda en coger carrerilla para no soltarte hasta el final  y es que la necesidad de saber que narices habia pasado era demasiado grande  Tanta que me he pasado unos dias en los que no queria comer ni dormir  ni hacer otra cosa que no fuera seguir leyendo  Y lo mas importante  el final esta muy a la altura a pesar de todo lo que se enreda la trama Y Rachel  oh dios  pobre Rachel  Me daban ganas de traspasar las paginas  abrazarla y decirle que todo acabaria saliendo bien  Aunque si yo estuviera en su situacion  estaria mucho peor que ella  Vaya personas con las que tiene la mala suerte de cruzarse  Son todos  sin excepcion  para darles de comer aparte  Y pensar que existira gente asi   Despues de todo lo dicho  que ganas de leer mas cosas de la autora   Great twist ending  I loved it   my first adult book ever lol  no shame   I loved this book  I couldn t put it down  which is something I yearn for when I m reading a book  In fact  I was about thirty pages from the end the day I finished it  and I was running late for my shift at the hospital because I HAD to see what happened  Thankfully  my shift got cancelled  and my first thought was  thank goodness   I can stay here and find out what happens  Great read  great story   Loved this book so so much  Also loved the added Bosnian character since I m Bosnian  Not one of the narrators in the book was likable but that s what I loved about it  Rachel made so many HORRIBLE choices and I couldn t help but cringe reading her narrative every single time  Anna and her self righteous indignation over Rachel  interrupting  her life had me boiling with anger  And Megan was a lost soul that I just couldn t help but feel the most sorry for  She is one of those people that is never satisfied with her life no matter what  She can t help being constantly miserable and making everyone around her miserable as well  The men of the book all appear fairly normal as compared to the women but the more I read the more I saw how horribly flawed they are  All in all I would recommend it to my friends   and guess what  I have   Brilliant   it s possible to miss what you ve never had  to mourn for it  A psychological thriller with as appropriate a name as it can be  Though the protagonist is based in Asbury but most of the events unfold in a periodic train ride  Even though many of the reader would contemplate it as another  Gone Girl  as both give an impression of a psychological thriller  It is more of a whodunit story with an added psychological theme  The added psychological theme make the plot more circuitous and a game turner  The most salient feature of this book is how the reader is kept guessing till the first 100pages as to what the book is all about  The cases are strong and with an intriguing background  This book is surely a book worth your time  The book didn t capture me at first  But  it had a sort of raw emotion that I feel like the author had captured very beautifully towards the middle of the book  I was quite early to catch on to the twist because Tom was a common factor for everything that had happened to Rachel  To be honest  I sympathise with him  He had several mental illnesses which he wasn t clinically diagnosed for  Being a BPD and a pathological liar  things you do aren t always reasonable  and his condition was far worse and scary too because he managed to live out a life while managing to fool two of the people he was most close to  I feel like if the author had highlighted his past and what made him like that  the book would have become even more of an excellent read  Nonetheless  I ll rate this book 5 stars because I was unable to put this book down after Scott found out about Rachel s lies  The book really took an interesting turn from then on   The Girl on the Train earned instant accolades when it was released  even earning the Goodreads Best Reads award   and all of that is more than deserved  The story is told through the eyes of three characters  Rachel  an alcoholic who is still reeling from her divorce two years ago  Anna  former mistress now married to Rachel s ex husband  Megan  the restless  discontent wife of a Scott whose disappearance sparks off the plot of the book  Rachel sees Megan and Scott every morning as she rides the train into London and makes up a rich fantasy life for them  living vicariously through this fantasy as a means of coping with her own failed marriage  When she reads of Megan s disappearance in the paper  she entangles herself into the investigation and finds herself caught up in a web of lies  affairs  and past secrets Despite the fact that the ending was  unfortunately  spoiled for me  the mystery was still compelling   Thrillers  have become synonymous with international espionage plots and two dimensional Bond wannabe characters  but The Girl on the Train returns to the true meaning of thriller  The back and forth between characters and times circles the reader around the heart of the mystery  while the snippets that Rachel sees through the window of the train lend a voyeuristic air to the book What truly impressed me  however  was the stunning characterization  Rachel is a deeply flawed character  a pathetic alcoholic who has to beg money from her mother since being fired from her job and routinely tries the patience of her friend landlord  She never outright apologizes for her alcoholism or even seems cognizant of the depth of her addiction  Despite this  she is truly sympathetic  Her agony over being tossed aside for another woman who shares the seemingly perfect life with her ex husband is palpable and touching  The reader can t help but feel pity and some disgust when she pines for her ex husband even after two years  but still root for her  I d like to make a special note that if you do not want to be spoiled over  whodunnit   do not click the spoiler block  view spoiler  Tom s characterization is another stunning example  It would have been so easy to go wrong with him  He could be awful  or  even worse  too likable  But Hawkins never misses a step  His seeming protectiveness over his new family is spoiled by the fact that he had an affair and left his wife in the first place  The way he talks Anna out of calling the police and tries to reason with Rachel s alarming behavior paints him sympathetically  but not too much  And  most chilling  is the end  The actual confession wasn t that shocking  but the way Rachel realizes that he believes his own lies sent a chill up my spine The only place I felt it faltered was with Anna  who seemed unreasonably calm toward the end  I could see her being afraid for her child  but she actually entertains the idea that she would be so happy to be rid of Rachel that she would be happy with Tom   despite him confessing to an affair  a murder  and assaulting his ex wife in front of her  I just couldn t suspend my disbelief at that part  I understand that the point was to show how desperately she wanted that perfect fantasy life  the kind that Rachel manufactured for Scott and Megan  and the kind that Megan yearned for but could never quite achieve  but     seriously   hide spoiler  The book was a classic  and it s easy to see why it gained so much notoriety  This is a chilling  compelling  and imminently readable book  one that shows effortless talent by Paula Hawkins  If you haven t read it yet  do so  Popsugar 2016  A book being made into a movie this year TRUST NO ONE  What a fabulous ride  I had so much fun reading this book  It kept me guessing and I had a really hard time putting it down  The story is told primarily by the main character Rachel aka the girl on the train  And like many commuters she looks out the window as she rides and she happens to notice a couple she sees all the time who she names Jess and Jason  Then one day she sees something upsetting  something she just can t let go  and the ride begins  The characters were all really good  there are a lot of twists and turns  and I thought the ending was very satisfying  This was so good  This is definitely a good choice for anybody looking for something as messed up and intense as Gone Girl  I was hooked from the beginning  Fantastic  One of the few books I have ever read where I hated all the characters but loved the story Really kept me guessing  Felt a tiny bit ripped off because I didn t feel they gave you enough clues to acurately guess till the very end  still an excellent book  If you add a little bit of Hitchcock s REAR WINDOW and Flynn s GONE GIRL mystique you will find the suspense and intrigue in Paula Hawkins  THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a thriller readers won t want to put down  Hawkins introduces her main protagonist  Rachel Watson to her readers sharing her backstory and when needed provides more details  Paula Hawkins will thrill fans of Hitchcock and Flynn s writing and won t be disappointed as they read THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN Rachel travels round trip from Ashbury to London  THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN  storyline begins with Rachel looking out her train window and seeing her former home  Hawkins introduces the support characters Megan and Anna who live in the houses Rachel s train passes each day  The author delivers her suspense thriller in the point of view of these three women  Rachel is dealing with personal issues and drinking blackouts   Megan has secrets from her past and an affair  and Anna is Rachel s ex husband s wife  When Megan suddenly disappears  Rachel knows something about her disappearance but her drinking and blackouts make everything she says suspect  Hawkins continues to give readers Megan s thoughts giving them background leading to her disappearance   The author show Anna s anger towards Rachel when Anna exposes Rachel s drinking problem to tells everyone including the police  Hawkins helps describes Rachel s inner strength  even with everyone doubting Rachel doesn t give up looking for answers  Hawkins keeps her readers guessing what Rachel remembers and who is responsible for Megan s disappearance  THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN delivers a psychological thriller gripping her readers and making them hold their breath to the unpredictable ending  Paula Hawkins  THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a must read and earns a 5 star ranking   I know there are a lot of comparisons to Gone Girl and though there were similarities the books are really very different  There is a beautiful blonde wife that goes missing and the book is told in the narrative of a few people but this one feels different  I never actually liked anyone i Gone Girl from the start where as here I liked Rachel  yes  she has a drinking problem and she makes many stupid mistakes but there is something about her that makes you root for her  You want her to fix herself  get her act together and you worry about here  I won t go into details because you get all you need about the book by reading the blurb  I will just say that the mystery is good and I really had a hard time putting the book down  I finished it in one day  It s probably a 4 5 star read  It s not perfect  but it is really  really good  It s compulsively readable and fast paced  The narrators are unreliable which leaves you guessing up to the end  although what happened is what I thought happened  I wouldn t have been surprised if it would have gone another way    What a roller coaster ride  I honestly had no clue who did it till the very end  I love that in a book  This was brilliantly written and again people   no comparison with Gone Girl  Rachel took the train everyday and she came to see a couple in their yard she started fantasizing about how happy they were and then one day she sees something the wife has done  I secretly think she took train to spy on ex husband who lives in same row complex   She thinks they have this picture perfect marriage   Scott   Megan  she becomes involved in their life after a tragedy and falsely lets Scott believe she is Megan s friend  This is where all leads to disaster  like a train collision of very own  Rachel was lonely and a drinker unhappy with life   Her husband had an affair and married Anna and they lived in her old home and had a child together  something she could not give Tom  I felt sorry for her she was lonely and was looking for an escape into someone else s life  Anna I disliked from the beginning and still disliked her in the end  Scott and Anna would be perfect together  both narcissistic in every way  They are not connected in anyway but should of been I highly recommend this book for a good mystery   Every page kept me wanting to know more  I will definately read more of her future books to come  I was not dissatisfied  4 75 stars  This book drew me in immediately  It was just as gripping and suspenseful as  Gone Girl   but with a MUCH more satisfying ending  I knocked off a quarter of a star though because I guessed  who did it  about 75  of the way in  About 80  in is when shit hit the fan  I was SO close to having my mind blown by the outcome  I would recommend  The Girl on the Train  to anyone who loves mysteries thrillers  Absolutely fantastic read  I love this book  I used to read a lot but after I became the victim of depression I don t read that often anymore  Most books bore me to the bones  But I love this book because I have actually experienced the feelings that Rachel has been experiencing The author seems to have a deep understanding on a variety of psychological phenomena  depression  self consciousness  anxiety  paranioa  insomnia  anger  disgust  blackout  distrustfulness  and vulnerabilty For me  this book is about the portrayal of the nature and the interplay of these phenomena through main characters  Love it Love it to the bones  Great book  Couldn t put it down    nhyt rwy  ft  lqTr Hl  fy lbdy  knt mtkhylh rwy  Hlm  btHky qSS lqTr lmkhb   wlshGf blHy  wl shq wkl lSwr lly

Literary Lawyer   A Dazzling Debut   5 Stars  This is easily amongst the best debut novels I have ever read  The story was taunt  the characters deeps and developed and the mystery and suspense had me guessing from start to finish  Regardless of the fact that it was an incredibly polished first novel  this book would have received 5 stars if it was the 1st or 15th book by this author  While this is one of the best books I have read this year  it will not be for everyone  It does bear similarities to several other  buzzy  books over the past couple of years   Gone Girl  and  Before I Go to Sleep  are the first two that come to mind  Since I haven t yet posted those reviews  I can tell you that I loved Gone Girl and hated Before I Go to Sleep  If you liked one of the two aforementioned novels  you will probably enjoy this one  The Plot The story is told from the perspective of three different characters  Rachel  the girl on the train  Anna  the wife of the Divorcee and Megan  the missing wife  The story opens with Rachel on the train and her daily commute into the city  Deeply unhappy as a result of a broken relationship and struggling with addiction  she finds herself creating an idealized narrative based on her observations of a husband and wife she sees daily outside the window of her train car  Her fantasy narrative is shattered when she notices changes at the home and the women  through whom she was living vicariously  goes missing  Rachael realizes that On the night the Megan goes missing  she had been in that neighbourhood  drunk and disoriented and left with vague memories  Are these memories keys to solving Meagan s disappearance  The plot intricately weaves the complex narratives of these three women and the three men in their lives  One of these six has committed a crime but their narratives are so closely entwined that you will believe each one of them is the guilty party  My Take This book has received plenty of buzz and has continually been referred to as the  next  Gone Girl   In some ways this is a fair comparison  Both books have generally unlikable characters  intense human drama  crime  passion  neurosis  unreliable narrators  multiple perspectives of the same events and provide and intense study of the characters  I think it is fair to suggest that if you did not like  Gone Girl  you are unlikely to enjoy this novel  That said  this is not is not the little sister to  Gone Girl  and while each character is unlikeable in some way  some of elements of their personality leave room for sympathy  While the former may have attributed to the success of the latter  it tells a far more complex tale and provide a more compelling mystery While there is little to like about each of the 6 major characters   Rachel  Megan  Anna  Scott  Tom and Kamal   they do retain some positive qualities despite the fact that each of them can serve as poster children for one or more of each of the Seven Deadly Sins  Often times  unlikable characters will drag a story down if it is not mitigated  In my opinion  the mitigating factor in this book is the intense character study of each of the three women  Their perspectives of the events were intensely clouded by their own failings  shortcomings and addictions but each character was so expertly crafted that you began to understand their motivations even if you didn t agree with them  In my opinion  insight into a character is far more important than liking the character  Personally  I find the best and most compelling novels that focus on the characters and their development  This is one of the best examples of this in recent memory  While the actions and attitudes of the characters are distasteful  immoral and selfish  their motivations are explored but never excused  The book doesn t ask you to like the characters or approve of their actions  It doesn t ask you to share their perspective or accept their actions but does provide you the opportunity to understand the minds that propel the characters  Within a single page you will find yourself both intrigued and repelled  fascinated and disgusted  confused and accepting Given the clouded perspectives  the narration tends to be unreliable  Rachel is unable to rely on her own memory at the best of times  Add in memories shrouded by a blackout and the reader is often unsure of what to believe  While this could have resulted in much frustration  the author provided a vein of reliable narration from Megan which serves to stabilize the whole novel  Final Thoughts  The Girl on the Train  is a wonderful example of compelling mystery and complex character development  Chances are that you will not say  Aha  I knew it was  _________  all along  but rather   I though it could have been them   While in  Gone Girl  the mystery played second fiddle to the characters   Girl on the Train  uses the mystery as a vital element in the development of each character  Truly one of the best books I have read this year  Audiobook Notes I listened to audiobook version of the novel  Each of the women had their own narrator and each narrator did a wonderful job  The narrator that voiced Rachel was especially good at infusing emotion into her voice  This book is tailor made for an audiobook and I highly recommend the format  Buah  me ha gustado tanto esta lectura que no se muy bien que decir porque tampoco os quiero contar mucho  pienso que es un libro que hay que leer sin mucha informacion sobre el Este libro trata sobre Rachel que todos los dias coge siempre el mismo tren a la misma hora  Ese tren siempre para en un semaforo y justo se para al lado de una urbanizacion y a Rachel le llama la atencion una casa que vive una pareja y ella se imagina la vida perfecta y feliz de ellos  pero un dia sucede algo  algo ve Rachel y entonces es cuando empieza la historia  Y hasta aqui puedo contaros  pero digamos que el libro trata de resolver que es lo que ve Rachel aquel dia Para empezar tengo que decir que los personajes me han encantado  estan muy bien definidos dentro de su locura  Mi favorita es Rachel  aunque he tenido sentimientos encontrados con ella porque me tiraba por la borda todas mis  teorias  y literalmente  me estaba volviendo loca En cuanto a la trama    me volvia loca con mis teorias que me cambiaban a casi cada capitulo pero es una de las cosas que mas me han gustado y reconozco que cuando iba por la mitad del libro estaba deseando leerme el ultimo capitulo para saber la verdad y acabar con esta locura  Tambien me ha gustado mucho la forma de escribir de esta autora  hace que te enganches a la historia de tal forma que no puedes parar de leer  Te hace creer una cosa y luego te la cambia con otra teoria y asi    la verdad que juega muy bien ese papel para confundirte de tal manera que crees volverte loca como la protagonista En cuanto al final  la gente tiene muchas quejas de que es predecible y muy tipico  pero a mi me ha gustado  Hasta unas 90 paginas de terminar el libro no tenia una teoria clara de lo que estaba sucediendo y ademas pasan cosas que me dejaron muy loca  tanto en el final como en casi todo el libro  Y si  me gusta como termina  aunque por ponerle una pega me hubiera gustado un final mas feliz  Ya nos digo mas  creo que es suficiente y os lo recomiendo mucho  teneis que leerlo  Este libro se va directamente a la lista de mis mejores lecturas del 2015  Well the book was intense  that s an understanding  I usually don t really read mystery books but with this one  I couldn t put it down  The story start calm and normal with Rachel on the train going to work and seeing a couple in a house that she named Jess and Jason  She loved their relationship  she even get jealous until one day going home  on the train  she sees Jess also named Megan doing something unexpected  The next day she is gone missing  Rachel couldn t help but tell what she saw to Jason  well Scott  Soon she find herself into the mystery and there is no way to get out of this mess  She tries to help to search where is Jess and at the same time  she tries change her bad habits  We follow the life of Rachel  Anna and Megan as the accident just happened  To see three different point of view was really great because when we thought that we would find some clue  it changed point of view  Also the fact that these three woman  who we thought didn t have a lot in common really do  The end is really not what we would except and it really took me by surprise  The cleverness of the author who wrote at the beggining two little paragraph before the first chapter and in fact that reveal to be really important  I also appreciated the fact that the character have flaws and qualities  basically the fact that they aren t perfect make the story even better   Loved the book   Twists and turns right to the endThe ultimate whodunit  This book is hard to put down and leaves you wanting more  As as matter of fact I do  Book  16 Read in 2015The Girl on the Train by Paula HawkinsPeople have been comparing this book to Gone Girl and that comparison is pretty spot on as this thriller has not so likable characters and a plot that will keep you reading and unable to put the book down  Rachel has lost her job due to her drinking problem but in order to not have her roommate find out  she continues her daily train commute  This ride has her passing her old house  where her ex husband now lives with his new wife and baby daughter  and a house nearby where a young couple lives  Rachel invents names and a storyline for this couple and feels as if she knows them  The wife then turns up missing and Rachel is drawn into trying to find out what happened  The plot has many twists and turns and will keep readers hooked from beginning to end  I highly recommend it http   melissasbookpicks blogspot com Right out  I have to say I enjoyed this book hugely  All the characters were very flawed in their own individual ways  which I guess makes them very real  but I was dying to give Rachel a bit of a slap and tell her to get a hold of her self during the first hundred pages  but then that kind of helplessness is what is most destructive with her character flaws  Once the build up was over  the action keeps flowing and with several twists and turns it leads quickly to an extremely satisfying ending It is heavily woman focused  but that is what I expected from the title  Its nice to get an insight into the minds of the more powerful gender  and see that they too have feet of clay  This book kept me guessing throughout  It was a compelling and quick read  It reminded me of Gone Girl and I can totally see it as a book  It s just a matter of time       5 Addicting Stars    My first thought after reading this book was  yup  it lived up to the hype   This is a fantastic debut novel  one that I won t soon forget  Does it live up to the Gone Girl status  Yes  in a way it does  The story has the same type of unreliable narrator who is suffering from her own problems and us readers don t know whether to believe her or not  Can we readers guess who is behind Megan s disappearance  Nope  I wanted to think I knew who did it  but when I really found out I was as shocked as everyone else  This book is awesome  albeit  a bit dark and depressing  I had so many feelings while reading this that my head started to spin  Honestly  if you haven t picked this one up yet than I implore you to do so  It s just a very  very  good book  No wonder it got a goodreads award Anyway  the book is about a woman named Rachel who rides the same commuter train every day  At first I wanted to believe it was because she had to work like everyone else  but I was lead to believe wrong  You see  Rachel is hiding from her demons  She lost her job because she is an alcoholic and is trying to hide this news from her flat mate  It s crazy how well Rachel is hiding her wrong doings and I can t help as a reader feeling a bit bad for her  So what Rachel does on this train  each  and every day  is watch the houses go by  But not only this  she fantasizes about the people who live there  You see  she is already familiar with this neighborhood as she used to live there  with her husband  until he left her for another woman  And stranger things continue to happen  her ex husband now lives in the same house he shared with her  with the woman he left her for  Pretty twisted if you ask me  Either way  Rachel s fantasizing  her mixed up emotions for her ex husband and his new wife  and now a murder mystery begins to plague Rachel s life  She starts with one bad decision  and her life begins to spin even more out of control than it was previously  Yikes  The happenings in this book are quite unbelievable and twisted Overall  I loved everything about this book  It s dark  twisted  depressing  and unique  The author has quite the imagination and she certainly brings it to life in this book  Again  if you haven t read it than you should  It s awesome  I can t wait to see what the author thinks up next   So  my new pet peeve is when literary critics refer to a new  well written psychological thriller as the  next Gone Girl   I absolutely loved Gone Girl  However  I do not think that this book resembles that book in as many ways as these critics make it seem  There are similarities  certainly  It is a psychological thriller and incredibly well written  The plot is confusing and ironic  as it is intended  The most valuable qualities of this book are the irony and character development  Without giving any spoilers away  I will just say that I am just so pleased I read this book  It was enthralling  emotionally provoking and ironic   A fantastic read  I really enjoyed this book  The suspense builds nicely  so you cant stop reading  wanting to know whats going to happen next  I can t stop thinking about this one  If you re a fan of Gone Girl  you ll like this book  More damaged people trying to out crazy each other  and I didn t guess the ending  Thought the book was awesome  Quick read and an excellent thriller   I have to say that this book was riveting  From the moment I started reading it I couldn t put it down  It s full of mystery  suspense  and secrets  If you re looking for a thriller Paula Hawkins debut novel will not disappoint  I strongly recommend reading this  Amazing Finished in 6 days Can imagine this being a film one day Chapters similar to gone girl  Smart  clever  original  Very enjoyable   Loved it  Simply excellent  A very intricate story  where nothing is quite what it seems and no one can be trusted  I loved this book   I have to admit  this book was awesome although it dealt with some erratic personalities  my mind was extremely wrapped in a ton of different directions  Rachel is a crazy jealous lonely individual  Anna I felt was a ticking time bomb  Megan was a ticking time bomb  the author completely fooled me in every part of the book  I recommend this book to readers who like suspense and readers who can have a good imagination  I had to reread multiple sections throughout the book to make sure I understood certain things take your time when reading this book and understand that most of the readings are from the characters minds  I just really enjoyed reading this book  the author Paula Hawkins will have a tough time making her next book just as good as this one POV  Alternating first person between Rachel  Anna and MeganIt s been a few days now since I finished The Girl on the Train  I waited to write this review because I felt like I needed to mull things over  let things marinate in my head  before trying to write down my thoughts  My initial rating was four stars but this book has stayed with me  I keep thinking about it and remembering things and making connections  It s definitely a book that I would re read and for that reason  I ve since bumped up my rating to a full five stars  Reading this book felt somewhat voyeuristic because these characters and their lives are completely raw and gritty and we see far beyond the masks they each wear day to day  That voyeuristic feel is apropos because Rachel  in turn  is also a voyeur who peeks into the backyards of her ex husband and their neighbors while riding the train every day  All of the characters  and the narrators in particular are  by turns  sympathetic and also horribly disgusting human beings  Their personalities are each distinct yet they each have this pervading darkness  The book blurb does a pretty good job of giving an idea of the plot without giving anything away so I won t rehash it here  This book will grab you right from the beginning  Rachel is like a train wreck and it s hard not to watch  As the book unfolds  though  you ll be sucked in even deeper and start to see connections everywhere  All three of the narrators are unreliable so with each chapter  the reader gets another piece of the puzzle and another suspicion  This is not a traditional  whodunnit  kind of mystery  but suspicion does fall on just about every character at some point in the book  And none of them are ruled out until the very end  I had no idea where this train was going to take me until I ended up there  I think the comparisons to Gone Girl are deserved  Although the plots are not really similar  they both have flawed and unreliable narrators and a dark and gritty feel to them  They both are layered exceptionally well and you won t know what s going on until the author wants you to   I don t remember the last time I started and finished a book in one day  but this was a definite page turner  I enjoyed it immensely and found it completely unpredictable  I definitely recommend it  I don t  listen  to books  I haven t had a book read to me since I was little  Since I started taking the bus though  I have found that listening to a book is better than trying to focus on a page on my kindle  So the first book I started listening to was this one   and I couldn t stop  The story had me hooked from the first word and I was anxious to hear what happened next  The readers gave the story so much character and I learned to love hate them as the story unfolded  As for the story itself  it had everything   drama  suspense  humor  romance  a little twisted but it was there   If you do nothing else  read this book  Or listen to it   you will not regret it  Wow just wow  I don t even know what to say this book was so good I read more than half of it today  This is what a thriller is supposed to be like  This book has literally left me speechless   What a surprise  I didn t exspect it to be so good  Thrilling till the last page  Very well written  I read it in two nights instead of sleeping because it was so good  Now I m tired  It was worth it  So many suspects  so many forgotten missing memories  and so much booze lead to an interesting mystery told through three women s perspectives  One is unreliable because she drinks  a lot  One is narrow and hateful  One is immature and unstable  The most likable character is the drunkard  We get her perspective the most but her memory of the night when Megan goes missing is like Swiss cheese  Until she finally remembers  her Nancy Drew investigation takes you on a roller coaster ride of intrigue and bad decisions  I hate that the characters weren t more likable as a whole but still really enjoyed the story   Rachel una alcoholica  divorciada hace un tiempo  a causa de que su marido tenia un amante  Anna  quien estaba embarazada  Rachel tenia una vida miserable  lo unico que alegraba su dia  el amargo sabor del vino rozandole sus labios  segun ella el alcohol la dejaba dormir  Ella siempre tomaba 2 trenes  uno a la manana y otro a la tarde  amaba el tren  Especialmente el crujido de sus vias  Cada viaje que hacia  se enfocaba en la terraza de una casa victoriana  donde se encontraba una pareja felizmente casada  y por supuesto enamorada  Decide invitarles nombres  Jess y Jason  ademas de construir una vida perfecta para ellos  la que ella sonaba  Su rutina cambia  cuando su Jess desaparece   podra estar involucrada ella misma sin saberlo  Wow  fue un thiller que me dio vueltas la cabeza todo el libro  Habia escuchado muy buenos comentarios acerca de el  y no me resisti a comprarlo  en cuanto lo empece  me prometi leerlo hoy y terminarlo hoy  Es el primer libro asi que leo y me quede sorprendida de lo mucho que me gusto  La chica del tren  puede llegar a complacer todas tus expectivativas y a la vez asustarte  incluso llegue a dudar de mi misma   After reading   sample   I have not any doubt I want to read this book I am happy I was not disappointed and even more  I was terrified Detective story is the perfect frame interweave thoughts and contemplations and demonstrate truly curious way of processing information by our brain I love the plot and alive psychological characteristics  The way of writing senses like free and easy breathing  The protagonist has really nobel personality and  despite of alcohol addiction she is fighter It turned out nothing is what it seems   This was an awesome Audiobook as the women who played Rachel really made it come to life  She made you feel sorry for her  where as the actor playing Anna made her seem like a total bitch  I found it quite interesting as the story switched points of view through the book and you got bits and pieces of the whole story  it was all ties together nicely in the end   A Real Page Turner with A Surprise EndingYou won t go wrong with this book  Terrific character descriptions   I feel like I can see them all  A wild ride  this book had me thinking from beginning to end  Amazing thriller  Loved it  Great psychological thriller with highly x  ed up characters   I loved the concept of how this book is written  The story s main character rides a train each morning and evening to get to London  She always watches for her old neighborhood and discovers a couple in one house that catches her attention  She creates a story of their life The book starts with the thoughts of the main character on the Morning and Evening train rides  Soon two other characters thoughts are added The books is captivating and I couldn t put it down  If I didn t have to teach school I would have never left my bed so I could finish  There has been a lot of media attention comparing this to Gone Girl but I found them to be quite different although I read and enjoyed them both  The main character in Girl on the Train is seriously flawed and has some issues but still manages to be a sympathetic character and one you want to root for  It is the kind of book you can t give details about without spoiling the ending  Suffice it to say it was suspenseful  well written and guaranteed to keep you turning those pages to find out what happen next  A very enjoyable read  I was worried this book wasn t going to live up to all the hype  but trust me  it did  This was a delicious suspense tale that absolutely delivers on the twists and turns  From a craft standpoint  Hawkins does some amazing things with narrative distance and delivery that add to  and certainly don t overshadow  the drama  I rarely call books  page turning   but this one definitely earns that description  All around good storytelling   It has been a long time since I ve read a book that I had serious trouble putting down  Like avoiding social situations trouble  Staying up late when I have to work the next day  Creepily dreaming about it  What a thrill  And don t even compare it to Gone Girl  other than the fact that it s also about a missing woman  switches perspectives  etc   because Gone Girl was not 1 5th the book this was  Nick and Amy Dunne   BORING  Never mind about them  this is a different review  But I would hate it to hear if you didn t read this because you didn t like Gone Girl But the story in TGOTT    the intensely human and flawed characters    the twisted relationships    the nail biting edge of your seat suspense  A twist worth waiting for  What a ride  I absolutely loved this book  I found when I wasn t reading it  I was thinking about it  It is one of the best thrillers I have read in a while  I highly recommend it   Oh my gosh   hated to finish this  The storyline played with my brain and Gripped me to the end  Reminded me of Gone Girl  and a little bit of We were Liars  Loved this physiological thriller  read it late into the night until it was over  It is very well written  I loved the way the author slowly revealed the story  The format is my favorite type of read   flipping back and forth between characters  and their perspectives of what is happening  I spend a lot of time speculating on what was going on  The main character is hopeless yet very sympathetic  you can t help but like her  Very happy I read this    I expect there will be a lot of talk and attention given to this book  One question that I am going to submit to the author   is there any significance to the cover of the book  The paper is very rough and coarse    very satisfying to hold this book as opposed to reading it on ipad kindle  etc  Enjoy  So good      I thoroughly enjoyed this read  This story was not predictable  halfway through I had no idea what exactly had happened and was genuinely surprised by the twists  I definitely can see this going to film  Amazing book and audiobook  The three perspectives of events that occurred over the course of about a year were interesting  insightful and misleading  The use of three different narrators in the audiobook for the three different women s perspectives really made this work  I ve already started listening to the audiobook again and picking up on all of the clues and the pieces that I missed or misunderstood now that I have new context with the resolution  At times I found myself disliking ALL of the narrators but I think that makes their characters more real  A captivating book   Ufff  buenisimo Bien por la autora  muy bien por este csi novelon  I loved this book from the first chapter  Just finished The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  I can honestly say  this was the best book I ve read in quite a while  I literally could not wait to pick it up again  I found myself listening to it like junkie  The story is about an alcoholic  who blacks out quite often  She spends her life taking the train passed her old house  obsessing about her ex husband and his new wife  She also the fantasizes about a couple she sees at this station regularly  imagining they are perfect in every way  One problem   The wife of the so called perfect couple ends up missing   I don t know what else Paula Hawkins has written  if anything  but I do know I ll be looking for it and it will be on the top of my list  5 out of 5 stars Excellent book  Grabs you in from the get go  Suspenseful  Intriguing  Surprising  Deep characters and complex plot  Sad and a little hard to read how Rachel struggles so with alcohol   Though I must admit I could relate and understand from the perspective of someone that has always struggled trying to get a handle on her weight   Shows the depth of evil  hatred  apathy  and selfishness in humanity  Surprising ending  Well written and cleverly arranged  told from the perspective of three different women  Highly recommended  Fast read   This book was amazing  Highly recommend  It amazes me that authors can dream up such wacked out  disturbed characters  So when I first started the book I felt as if it was written by an amateur writer  Then I read the black flap and realized this is her first thriller  I didn t mind the writing style that much  It was more of a journalist style  sth I was made sure of after reading the black flap  But the plot was perfect and she did a good enough job to pull it off  Somehow I got so absorbed that I didn t even pay attention to the writing any longer  The book was magnificent  Heart breakingly perfect  Absolutely stunning  I loved it  Love  love  love  It absorbed me and left me hungry for answers in a way I haven t been in a long time  It ended perfectly  Everything was so aligned that the ending seemed right even if I hadn t imagined it  The ending didn t come out of nowhere  There was facts all along that made the ending seem logical in a way most authors can t pull off  Half way through the story and I was already praying that Rachel isn t the murderer  The plot was beautifully thought of  All the details exactly in place  The writing improved throughout the story but all in all everything was so perfect that after a couple chapters I was so absorbed I completely forgot about it  If u haven t ever willingly picked up a book to read  let this be ur first  If u have then u will never regret reading this  I have read a rough 100 books since the beginning of 2015 and this has got to be in my top 5   The short review  Fangirling  Just totally could not get enough of this story  Stayed up late reading and then got up early to read  ON A SUNDAY  PEOPLE  Sleeping until 9 00 has been my idea of church for years now  NOT TODAY  Read this while I was brushing my teeth and washing my face  Wanted to take it with me on my jog  Resented  having  to go to a concert I was lucky enough to get free tickets to   yes  the music was exquisite  but why did it have to be playing today when I HADN T FINISHED THIS BOOK YET  Holy carp  what a rollercoaster The more coherent review  The writing reminds me a lot of Shirley Jackson  which is the highest compliment I can give  The structure is innovative  and Paula Hawkins knows how to give out just enough information to keep you running after more  but doesn t tease so mercilessly that you want to throw the book across the room It wasn t just the plotline that kept me glued to this book   I m barely exaggerating about that glue  I took it with me in my purse to that concert so I could read during the intermission  and actually tried to prop it up in such a way that I could read while I was making the bed  That s a cry for help  folks   It was the way Hawkins forced me to rethink and reexamine all my assumptions about the various characters  This story goes way beyond anything as simple as an unreliable narrator  THE WORLD is unreliable  Until it isn t  Until the right people have the courage to look squarely at what s in front of them  instead of being distracted by what they want to believe I am out of my mind over this book  and I m afraid that ll ruin it for some readers because come on   how could it live up to this kind of hype   I tried to read while shaving my legs  In the tub  with shaving cream and a new blade in my razor  I m almost sad that didn t kill me  because it would have made one hell of an obituary  So don t read The Girl on the Train just because I raved about it  Check out a few pages and see if it grabs you I m just saying  every once in a while a book goes bestseller because it s really  really good P S  Don t forget to reread the first couple of pages immediately after you finish this novel  Paula Hawkins pulls a bit of The Sound and the Fury action at the beginning of GOTT   not enough to drive a reader nuts  just enough to keep you wondering  Excellent story told from three points of view  plenty of plot twists  and perfect ending  Completely didn t see the end turning out the way it did  Great book  One of those that once you start it  you can t put it down   So many good books this year  One of my favorite literary devices is a good unreliable narrator  This book has one of the best  Highly recommended for a fairly easy read packed with excitement  A good  respectable beach book   In a word  or rather a phrase  The Girl on the Train is a HOT MESS  but in a good way  It was such an intriguing web of lies  mystery  and perspectives  The story is told by 3 different narrators  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  Just when I thought I had it all figured out  a different perspective was revealed that made me totally question what I  thought  I had figured out and sometimes the revealed information blew my current theory clear out of the water I found the story to be somewhat slow to start  but the tempo picked up as the other narrator s perspectives were shared  At first  I found the broken storyline that is split between the present  Summer 2013  and the past  approximately 1 year prior that progresses to the current day  somewhat confusing  but after a while I adjusted and it became easier  The mix of the various narrator s perspectives and the back and forth between the present and the past add to the intrigue and suspense  This book will remind readers of Gone Girl  but I found it to be much less darker and foreboding   I absolutely LOVED this book  Goes to show   things aren t always what they seem    From the way the book was written  by date almost like a newspaper  was genius I sometimes would flip back and forth to see what days corresponded with each character and what they were doing on a certain day in conjunction with someone else  The ending   lemme say   I didn t expect that  I didn t expect the culprit to be who it was  I will say  the character of Rachel was very relatable  yet bothersome  Only because she had allowed her ex husband to take her to such low depths  it just made me mad since I ve seen that happen personally in my life and those around me  This felt me turning pages late into the evenings   then I d have to remind myself I have to get up and go to work at 6 00am  This is for anyone who likes  who dunnit   books and loves a good thriller mystery  I didn t see the storyline moving like how it did  MUST READ FOR 2015    This was the kind of mystery thriller that I couldn t put down  I loved how the author told the story from the perspective of the three main women involved  They each have a distinct voice and story that added to the depth and complexity of the book  The portrayal of the main character as an alcoholic was insightful and added not only to character development but to the overall plot development as well  She is flawed  she us pitiful  and yet her story is unfolding too  He ending wasn t a complete surprise  but only because the author raised my suspicions at just the right time to add to the suspense of he final outcome  Great book  I understand why this is one of the  It  books of the summer and why all of the local libraries have long waiting lists to check this out    I could NOT put this down  In fact  I read it in 2 days and it has been awhile since I have been so immersed in a book that I stayed up to the wee hours of the morning to finish it  I highly recommend for anyone who enjoys mystery suspense  Hawkins writing is focused and propels you through the narrative  The characters are well developed   I felt empathy for Rachel and Megan despite their destructive behavior  I also thought the changes in narrator add depth to the story  giving the reader an omniscient knowledge while also serving to further develop the characters   Rachel is a mess  Once a happy  vivacious  gainfully employed woman  she now drinks to escape what her life has become  She now spends her days riding a train for no specific purpose other than to trick her flatmate  who believes she still has a job  Entranced in her made up story of a couple she regularly watches at a regular stop  she sees something she shouldn t  And now the woman is missing This is a brilliant  tension filled book that is nearly impossible to put down  It is directly responsible for my students not getting their papers back on time  Read it  For anyone who loves a plot that races around twisty bends so fast you re apt to get whiplash  THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is for you  But the real beauty of this novel lies in the deft way the author writes characters you ought to hate  but root for anyway  For instance  one of the main characters  Rachel  she s the girl on the train  is such a lush that at one point she leaves her piss soaked knickers in a heap at the bottom of the stairs and vomits as she s staggering up to her bedroom to pass out  leaving all of that stomach churning evidence of her night s activities for her poor roommate to discover  Ew  right  Yet  Rachel is one of the most compelling characters I ve come across in fiction lately  because she somehow keeps scrambling to her feet no matter how many times she s knocked down  There are two other female points of view in this novel that aren t any more likable  yet you end up hoping they manage to survive as well  Kudos to a very brave author who has given us a thrilling read that leads us into territory most writers fear to tread  for fear of alienating readers  It s an interesting tale of intertwined lives of seemingly normal people  I particularly liked the way the author has woven the characters and the complications of each relationship  The empty  sorry and the pointless life of the protagonist Rachel is well depicted  The non linear story being told from the vantage point of various key characters is also impressive As I read  the story kept getting interesting  it kept me guessing what Rachel would do next  It was unpredictable and very gripping  I will be keen to see the 70mm version of this story  Excellent  I couldn t put this book down and read it in two days  At one point early in the story I had a thought about the twist  but got so engrossed in the sorry  that I forgot all about it  The riding on the train and peering out the window is something that everyone can related to  What is going on behind the windows o f the homes that we see every day  I will recommend this book to everyone  It is a great read  especially when sitting in a warm  toasty home or on a warm  hot beach  Read this one and be prepared not to move for a while  it is that engrossing  Birkac dakika once bitirdim  Muhtesemdi    Sifir beklentiyle baslayin ve kitabin sizi cekmesine izin verin  Bu arada kitapta oyle hayran olacaginiz turde karakterler yok  ben kriz bile gecirdim    A totally compulsive  compelling  obsessive read  a real page turner  I COMPLETELY loved this book  well paced  well plotted  and the ending was everything but what I expected  I loved the suspicion  the longing to know who did this and who did that   a mind blowing psychological thriller  O livro conta a historia em 3 pontos de vista  O da Rachel  uma mulher em torno dos 30 anos  divorciada e alcoolatra  O da Anna  uma mulher que acabou de ser mae e que se casou com o ex marido de Rachel  E o ponto de vista da Megan  uma mulher casada com Scott e que desapareceu  Rachel passa todo dia de trem na frente da casa de Megan e observa o casal  criando fantasias e historias perfeitas para os dois em sua mente  ate que um dia ela ve algo diferente pela janela do trem na casa de Megan  Depois que descobre que Megan desapareceu  ela comeca a se envolver em sua procura  O livro foi maravilhoso  muito bem escrito e nao achei arrastado  Todos os personagens do livro tem uma certa paranoia de perseguicao  Achei interessante a presenca do ponto de vista da Megan  escrito em um passado antes dela desaparecer  O culpado nao e revelado em apenas uma pagina  de supetao  Sao descobertas feitas que levam a desconfianca e depois a saber que essa pessoa foi culpada  tudo desenvolvido em muitas paginas  Para mim foi uma surpresa a resolucao do caso  pois durante o livro todo nao pensei que o culpado era essa pessoa  Pensei que ia seguir um caminho de Garota Exemplar  mas nao  Foi muito bom e recomendo  I really enjoyed this book  The author did a great job with the unreliable narrator  and I switched back and forth between feeling pity for her and being disgusted by her  The weak female characters bugged me a little but by the end of the book  made sense  This book is compared to Gone Girl because of the unreliable narrator  but I did not finish reading Gone Girl because it didn t hold my interest  Hawkins does a good job keeping you guessing for most of the book  Hitchcock meets Gone Girl   This is a great noir thriller  Grim  lonely  dark  Yes a lot like a Hitchcock film Patricia Highsmith novel hybrid with some catty  dark side of domesticity  stuff thrown in  The women in this book are bedeviled with various ailments including alcoholism  depression  anxiety  toxic envy  codependency  and past trauma  I wont say more about how they end up in the same orbit  This book has been compared with Gone Girl but I object to that comparison both because the plots aren t actually that similar and since Hawkins has her own voice which is less descriptive than Flynn but more taught  direct and crisp which is what would have made this book a great black and white noir film     Maybe best directed by a woman  I forget the name of the woman who directed  in the cut  but shed be a good choice   Well Shiiiiiiiiiit Holy cow an excellent book  Even better when listened too  Bang up audio recording    Best one of 2015 so far     I previewed a couple of pages first as the book was recommended as a  if you liked Gone Girl  suggestion  And I loved Gone Girl  but loved this book even more  For a debut thriller Paula Hawkins made a great job of keeping me hooked  The characters and plot were brilliantly crafted  I m not usually a fan of first person writing for all characters but it worked here and there s a great plot twist at the end which caught me totally off guard  Really looking forward to seeing what the author comes up with next and recommend to all crime enthusiasts  Great book  Very exciting and suspenseful  I love when the author covers the same event from different points of view   Wow this book was as good as everyone had hyped it up to be   I am not into psychological thriller that much  It scares the shit out of me   chickeeeen      So why I gave this book a go  First  I decided few months ago to read Sandra Brown s Mean Streak w c is a mystery thriller  And with all honesty  it s kinda entertaining  Second   which is the very main reason   is because it topped The New York Times for the first week of February  So why not  right This book is the creepiest book I ever read in my entire life of existence  Okay  maybe I m quite exaggerating this  but seriously  it s eerie  I finished reading it around 4 in the morning  and it absolutely gave me goose bumps This book has three narrators  Anna Watson   the other woman  the lover  Megan Hipwel   the cheater who lived few doors away from Anna and Tom  and Rachel Watson   the alcoholic whose still can t get over of her ex husband s infidelity  the girl who is always on the train  Anna and Rachel s connection is obvious   Tom Watson  But how about Megan  Well  that s where the creepiness started which will make you guessing the entire moment   and then will make you gasp and hold your breath once all secrets finally revealed I just want to mention also  the author s ability to REALLY play with her reader s imagination is fuckin  superb  So if you want an exciting read  I recommend you to grab this one    Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and night  Every day she rattles down the track  flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes  and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck  She looks forward to it  She s even started to feel like she knows them  Jess and Jason  she calls them  Their life as she sees it is perfect  Not unlike the life she recently lost Until today and then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough  Now everything s changed  Unable to keep it to herself  Rachel goes to the police  Rachel once had the perfect life  Well  almost perfect  But she still had hope  Then she found out that her husband  Tom  had betrayed her with another woman  The blow was too much  She had to numb the pain  and alcohol did just that  Her drinking started early in the day as she rode on the commuter train to London each morning  She easily imagined the happiness of the beautiful couple that she could see on their deck through the train window  their loving caresses  his devotion  a life she could now only imagine  Rachel drank to oblivion but getting blind drunk didn t help  Then came the black outs  and she started calling Tom  wanting him back  harassing him and his new wife  She hated his new wife  who had his baby  the baby she should have had  Then she hated herself for being a failure  which made her drink even more  to the point of forgetting her self destructive and humiliating actions Then  on her regular morning commute  Rachel saw something shocking from the train window  Jess  the beautiful girl on the deck  did the unthinkable  She allowed another man to take her in his arms and kiss her  Rachel couldn t believe her eyes  Maybe she was in a drunken haze  No  it was true  Jess was cheating on Jason  How could she  Rachel s dream was shattered  just like her own life had been shattered  Then came the real shocker  When Rachel was watching the news  she saw the face of a murdered young woman  whose name was Megan  Rachel realized it was the pretty girl on the deck  the one Rachel had named Jess  Megan looked even more beautiful than Rachel had imagined  Rachel knew she must go to the police and tell them about the other man  Maybe he was somehow tied to the murder  But would they believe her  How could they since she was rarely sober  A murder  a red haired stranger on the train  the mystery man on the deck  Rachel s blackouts  all blend into an intense psychological thriller that will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat to the very end   I listened to this and COULD NOT STOP LISTENING  No info dumps or unnecessary descriptions   FANTASTIC written and audio narration  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE AUDIOBOOK     I really enjoyed this book and I really wanted to know what happened at the end  There are still some questions for me at the end   things I did not quite understand  details that don t seem to quite add up  but overall it was an excellent read  It was everything you d expect from a thriller   great suspense  good characters  great twists  I was worried at the start that the book would get confusing with three different narrators talking at different times  but it was surprisingly easy to follow  I liked the main narrator  Rachel  the most  She s highly unreliable but I found her quite touching with all her issues  The writing was also pleasant to read and felt honest and true   I could relate to the characters  even the darkest ones   Carve out some extra time for this wildly compulsive read  Hawkins is a wonderful author whose unreliable narrators will have you guessing whodunit to the very end  I couldn t put this novel down for long  Written in the vain of Gone Girl  this book is destined to be talked about by everyone in the coming months  I will definitely read Hawkins again  THEY ARE WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE   Dennis GreenIs this a quick read  Is the writing simple  Is there a soap opera esk feel  Is the main character an annoying mess  Yes  But those aren t bad things in this case  All those things add to the story  It s supposed to feel that way  These things fall in line with the plot that is mainly told in the mind of a lonely alcoholic The structure of the story was super fun  When the main character  Rachael  gets blackout drunk  which happens often  there are huge gaps in time where nobody knows what happened in the story  Dude  where s my car  Rachael then has to try to fill in the gaps This was a lot of fun  Some say it was predictable  I disagree  I had many suspects up until the point when Hawkins drops the key hint as to what Megan  the missing girl Rachael watches from her daily train rides  is up to This book has a female author and it s a crime mystery  That is where the similarities end between this and Gone Girl  Flynn is a straight up badass writer who I m down for whatever she writes  Hawkins executed a great  original idea and I hope she has future tricks in her bag  but I m not sure  Regardless  read this Side Note  I want a six pack of canned Gin   Tonic for tailgating  Bravo England  Me ha gustado mucho  Sin duda lo recomiendo    A fantastic mystery storyHonestly this is not what I expected when I bought this book  I expected a mystery but not one with a story so muddled by the memory of the sole witness  It took me longer than usual to figure out who had done it  Well written characters  no true heroes  The story reads like something that could happen The Girl On The Train  is a great whodoneit suspense laden thriller  The novel is filled with flawed characters who are so believable you can smell the alcoholic fumes coming off of protagonist Rachel  Riding the train into London everyday so her flatmate Cathy won t realize she no longer has a job  Rachel creates a fantasy world  life  for a couple who live a few houses down the street from Rachel s ex husband Tom and new wife Anna  Rachel calls the couple Jason and Jess  One day Rachel sees something  from the train window  that thrusts the perfectly imagined lives of Jason and Jess into stark reality  What I love best about this book is that the characters feel like someone you could know  the story reads like something that could happen  There were points where I was unsure what was going to happen next with the suspense building to breathe holding pitch but in the end leading to a conclusion that was credible  You know that little sad feeling you get at the end of the book because it s all said and done and you have to pick yourself up just like the girl on the train and get back to real life  I m already missing Rachel  I suppose she s a bit of an anti hero  or at the least unlikely      What a roller coaster    I thoroughly enjoyed the ride   At one point I thought it might just be a drunken women s imaginary reality  Wow     A MUST READ  So suspenseful at the end I had to put it down a couple of times   I had mixed feelings about this book  The start made me feel quite angry towards Rachel  I thought the woman was loopy to say the least but as the story continued I started to slowly feel sorry for her  mainly because I could see how she was being manipulated by the people around her  That does not mean that she was entirely blameless  I felt sorry for Anna at the start  mainly because I felt that the situation she was in was not completely of her own doing but  that changes as you read on  Again I realised that all was not as it seemed  Anna could be accused of bringing some of what was happening on herself and at times I thought she was very cold hearted  I actually enjoyed this book  the ending could have been better but actually there was no where else for the story to go and I was gripped from about halfway through until the end  If you liked Gone Girl or whodunnits then this is the book for you  a great holiday read  A First Reads win  I really enjoyed this book  wanting to read through it quickly  and not wanting to put it down  as the cliche goes  Rachel Watson rides the train into London every day  She frequently notices a couple on the terrace of their home in a suburban sub division and starts to make up stories about them  One day she sees a different man there with the woman  and the next day  the woman disappears  I don t want to say any more about the plot  as the novel makes a few interesting twists and turns along the way  Hawkins switches back and forth between three different narrators  two in the present  and one a year or so in the past   And  yeah  the Gone Girl comparisons weren t lost on me  but this isn t a rip off of that novel   I liked the switching back and forth in narrators  and wasn t ever exactly sure which  if any  of them could be fully trusted  Hawkins uses this to keep up the mystery   Rachel  for example  is a full on alcoholic  who suffers blackouts and can t always remember what happened to her   This was a fun read  even though the big reveal of the guilty party could be seen coming  I figured out who it was a bit before it s revealed   Still  it was interesting  well written  and lots of fun  No wonder this one is so popular  It is riveting and well paced  I planned to read a couple of chapters  and read it cover to cover in one evening  The characters are messy and out of control  but in a realistic way  I had a little trouble getting into it because it felt slow  but as the intensity started to build  and the violence increased  it got me hooked and I didn t want to put it down  I didn t see the ending coming which I like  This book is impossible to put down  I spent too many hours reading it because I just had to find out  who done it   It is a dark thriller with a complicated main character who we are not sure if we can trust  However  this unreliable narrator aspect is part of the intrigue with this book  You are just as informed as our main character  who is often drunk and unsure about everything  but you also get to read from other characters  perspectives which can be really interesting  The voyeuristic quality of this book is very interesting in that you are immediately swept into this world where you are often look through a small train window or the blurred eyes of a drunk  observing and analyzing with the narrator  It s the perfect mystery  Bello bello bello    Sicuramente vi verra da ridere  ma questo e stato il primo libro del genere thriller  Ho sempre voluto leggere sto gente ma non n e ho mai avuto l occasione  Bando alle ciance     Ora parliamo del libro Per quanto riguarda il tipo di narrazzione   e stata semplice  chiara ma mai banale  sono stati usati termini semplici e concisi per non distrarre troppo il lettore dalla parte piu importante  la storia  La storia e stata costruita in maniera perfetta   facendo crescere le aspettative man mano che si andava avanti   ma fermandosi anche ad analizzare particolari o personaggi che magari solo alla fine del libro se n e capito il senso  Una lettura tutta di un fiato    Consiglio al 100  questo libro   un gran bel debutto  Wow  It has been a long time that I could just sit and read a book all the way through in two days but this was worth it  It reminded me of why I ve always liked as a source of escaping  I felt very involved with all the characters  I don t want to give away too much so I will be brief  Rachel  has issues  She is a drunk  she is obsessed with her ex husband  and has lost her job  Every day she pretends to go to work so that her roommate doesn t ask questions  and takes the train into town  Each day on the train she passes her old neighborhood where her ex husband still lives with his new wife and child  which is a whole other form of dysfunction   A few doors down is a couple that she only sees from the train  who she refers to as Jason and Jess  They seem to be the perfect couple based on what Rachel sees from the train  They re always lovey dovey on the patio and reading the paper and drinking coffee together  One day Rachel goes by and notices that  Jess  is outside with a new man  The day after that Rachel sees  Jess s  face on the news and that she has come up missing  Rachel thinks she can help  but due to her instability and own regrettable past  and not even knowing the missing girl  Rachel comes off as an unreliable witness  I will stop there but highly suggest that you read this  I hope Hawkins writes more  and soon   One for sorrow  two for joy  three for girl  Three for girl  I am stuck at three  Remember when you watched Darren Aronofsky s Requiem for a Dream  Remember how you couldnt stop yourself from feeling sorry for the characters even though you knew things are going to be bad on their heroine and drug fueled path and none of this is good  That was one true example of a sheer genius of moving picture where everything just hit the most darkest corners of your mindset and it became impossible to get it out of your thoughts for days  Now imagine the same feeling stretched across 300 pages with psychological twists and turns so dense that you will actually find yourself thinking about these messed up people hours  maybe days  after you put the book down  The Girl on the Train is one powerful mystery thriller novel which mostly revolves around the darker shade of grey when it comes to good and bad  The novel is written with the perspective of three ladies  a drunk  a liar and a cheat  Talk about the charming leads  huh    The alcoholic who is not sure of the reality and her imagination  The liar who s entire idea of happiness is based on ignorance  And the cheat who only has her emotional fragility and depression to get closure from her loved ones  These shady characters make you question your own judgement of them as none of them is righteous and none of their actions are justifiable  Hawkins develops them with such a great precision that you will find yourself resenting them on one page and rooting for them on the other  What makes this read more intriguing is Hawkins narrative style where the events are described from the perception of only these three central characters than a third person point of view adding more layers into their personality  Readers familiar with Gillian Flynn s can totally find many parallels with Sharp Objects and Gone Girl  For me  its surely better and importantly more paced than the mentioned novels  Go read it asap and then bury it into your furthest corner only to revisit Rachel  Anna and Meagan into your nightmares  just like your own regrets  OH  MY  LANTA  I am soooo glad the hype of this book lived up to my expectations  I am skeptical to read books that it seems everyone raves about  because about 50 percent of the time  I am disappointed  The hype overshadows the actual story  and at the end I m left all  Seriously   But thank the book gods  The Girl on the Train was one hell of a ride  How much of what we see of someone s relationship is reality What gets hidden behind locked doors and drawn shades How well do we really know anyone An alcoholic  a liar  and a cheat  Which one do you trust This unsettling journey is told through three POVs  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  Rachel takes the train to and from London every day  getting a glimpse into the lives of those who reside near the tracks  She makes up stories about them  she gives them names  character traits  backgrounds  she creates a whole  perfect life for them in her head  Then one day  she sees something disturbing happen between  Jason and Jess    a couple she has become obsessed with  When that small incident evolves into something larger  and much more serious  Rachel finds herself smack in the middle of something she has no business being a part of   after all  she is just the girl on the train    There s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home     Whoa  This was crazy good  you guys  I can t really say much about the plot  because it really is a story you just have to experience for yourself  It s mysterious  gritty  deceiving  and utterly tantalizing  it is everything I want in a psychological thriller  I found myself completely enthralled with this story line  Every spare second I had  my nose was buried in this book  My mind was constantly whirring  putting together scenario after scenario  trying to figure out the answers  and just when I thought I had Sherlocked the case  Paula Hawkins threw another twist my way that sent me back to square one  The characters are all horribly flawed  they all have secrets  I think it s a true testament of a great author when they can make every  single main character unlikable in some way and still keep you invested in the story     I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their heart    I have seen a lot of people comparing it to Gone Girl  but I don t know how much I really agree with that  I know why the comparisons are being made  and as great as The Girl on the Train is  I don t think it holds a candle to Gone Girl   Just my opinion  of course   That being said  if you like Gillian Flynn s novels or just want a chilling page turner that will keep you guessing literally right up until the very end  this is your book  Read it and read it now  5 5   It s been a long while since I finished a book in a single day  but I couldn t leave this for more than an hour without picking it up again  Great reinvention of the thriller genre  Must read   Life is not a paragpraph  and death is no paranthesis  4 5 5The writing was very beautiful it had such an edge to it  very very engrossing  I read this in about 3 sittings and each of them were very long  I just couldn t put it down once I got into it The story itself was kind of crazy at times  it pushed every character s true colors out  which I really liked  It was easy for me to determine who I liked Rachel Kamal Cathy  and loathed Anna  Megan Riley  Although it took quite a time to feel connected to the main character  I did enjoy her povs as well as megans  It was a nice change every once in a while Also the themes this book explored were very dangerous and Hawkins did a perfect job in truly grasping those themes in a raw emotional way I couldn t stand Anna at all but I liked how she stopped the denial at the end and just jammed the corkscrew to move on I feel like the ending is insufficient  It didnt come as much of a shock because I did predict it  I would have liked an epilogue It was very enjoyable overall  I loved this thriller  could not put it down  If I could give it 6 stars  I would     For a book about a girl on a train  Paula Hawkin s novel certainly is a fast paced rollercoaster ride of a whodunnit  I picked this book up late one evening and stayed up past 2am reading it  I simply couldn t put it down  Much like  Gone Girl  the main characters have very few redeeming qualities  However  I felt more invested in Rachel Watson  a divorcee alcoholic who has lost not only her marriage to the bottle  but also her job  her confidence  and her motivation for anything but her next drink  than I felt in  Gone Girl  s similarly flawed Nick or Amy Dunne  On her daily commute to London  Rachel sees the same couple  whom she affectionately dubs Jess and Jason  and pictures what their fairy tale life is like from her seat on the train  But her belief in their perfect life comes crashing down when she witnesses  Jess  kissing another man  Outraged by this reminder of her own ex husband s affair  Rachel is determined to set things right by telling Jason about his wife s cheating  But things are turned upside down when  Jess   really Megan Hippwell  is reported missing  Filled with a new sense of purpose  Rachel insinuates herself into the investigation and Jason  Scott Hippwell s  life  It should have been painful to watch a woman with so little dignity  and who is even deemed an unreliable witness by the police  stumble around drunk as she pitifully scrambles to find a sense of importance in any way she can  At times  I mentally groaned as Rachel made yet another huge blunder  calling her ex husband yet again  showing up at his house  pretending she still had a job  making false claims about a friendship with Megan  lying to her flatmate about joining AA  was there anything this woman could do right  A more fitting title for the novel could even have been  Trainwreck Girl   However  through all of these mistakes and glimpses of who Rachel used to be  I couldn t help but to root for her to somehow pull it together However that seems less likely than ever  when Megan s body is found and Scott becomes suspect  1  and Rachel finds herself irretrievably involved in an increasingly dangerous situation  As she struggles to piece together the drunken events of the night Megan disappeared  she realizes that she may have witnessed more than what she had seen from her view on the train  Like Rachel  I could t imagine who was responsible for Megan s murder  even with the benefit of glimpses into the adulterous woman s point of view   Girl on the Train  kept me guessing almost to the very end and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a fast paced mystery with complex and human characters  What an exciting read  Paula Hawkins is a very talented writer  I was extremely engrossed in this book and once I got about half way through I found it rather difficult to put down  I must say I had the ending pegged from about somewhere in the middle of the book but the story was so well written and the outcome so cleverly disguised I think that most people would be kept guessing  Exceptional characters that make you emotionally attached to them and all round a great read  5 stars well earned  I loved the opening  Girl on train looks out of window on her regular commute to work and imagines what the people who live in the houses she passes are like  Something I ve done myself and I m sure other readers have too The story is told from the viewpoint of Rachel  the girl on the train  and reads like a diary entry  alternating with Megan  the girl who lives in the house Rachel watches and where she herself lived until her marriage broke up  We get to understand Rachel s sadness and frustration with her current life  Megan s seems so much more exciting with the handsome partner  often seen drinking wine and lovingly caressing her in the garden that used to be hers  Both Rachel and Megan have unlikable thoughts and behavior  Rachel drinks too much and often forgets what she s said and done  A characteristic that becomes more important as the plot develops  Megan has a guilty secret and seems unable to commit to a relationship The chapters of  The Girl on the Train  are short and compelling  The alternate point of view and uneven timelines work well  adding to the tension as Rachel gets more caught up in Megan s life and as a reader you wonder just how much you can trust her  The characters are extremely well drawn  especially the women  and the red herrings are skillfully placed  Overall this is a satisfying read and I can t wait to see how the film version pans out  Cuando alguien te observa y tu no te das cuenta    Puedes ser tan transparente que se hacen historias alrededor tuyo  La vida de 3 chicas y su relacion con esposos  novios  amantes y maestros    Que bonita familia  All inizio  la lettura e lenta  come un treno in partenza  pero  dopo i primi sferragliamenti  prende velocita  l ho letto in una sera fino a pag  62  e poi l ho lasciato sul comodino per circa un mese  come se fosse una bottiglia di vino che doveva decantare  Quello che mi ha colpito di questo romanzo e la sua struttura narrativa  mi sono sempre piaciuti i racconti a piu voci e qui sono tre le voci narranti principali  Rachel  la protagonista  e alcolizzata e depressa  E disoccupata  ma non ha il coraggio di confessarlo alla sua coinquilina  cosi  ogni giorno prendere il treno per Londra  E questo il momento della giornata che preferisce  quando puo fantasticare sulla vita delle altre persone  distogliendo l attenzione dai propri fallimenti  In particolare  le piace spiare una coppia  un uomo e una donna  senza nome  che ogni mattina fanno colazione in veranda  Per lei sono Jess e Jessie e la loro vita e un riflesso di quella che aveva con Tom prima dell arrivo di Anna  Anna e l altra  la donna che ha soppiantato Rachel nel cuore di Tom e che gli ha donato una figlia  Infine  c e Megan  la nuova vicina di casa di Anna e che  dopo aver perso il lavoro presso una galleria d arte sara per un breve periodo di tempo la baby sitter della figlia di Anna e Tom e che e sempre alla ricerca dell altro al di fuori del matrimonio Il carattere di queste tre donne e stato tratteggiato cosi bene dalla Hawkins da renderle quasi reali  con i loro pregi e i loro difetti  tanto da rendere quasi impossibile parteggiare per una o per l altra  Se all inizio  il comportamento di Rachel nei confronti dell ex marito e della sua nuova compagna puo essere riprovevole  man mano che si prosegue nella lettura  si capisce che la realta non e mai come appare  cosi come non lo e la vita di Megan e di suo marito  4 5 stars SPOILER ALERT   just kidding Lirim Brilliant  oh my    Brilliiiiiant  This is not my typical type of book  but I liked it a lot  It is very well written  with incredible words  an amazing pace and smooth to read The story pulls you page by page towards the story  immerses you with the scenario and the characters  slowly giving us account of this fucked up world and the hardships of human relationships with the lies that lay beneath the surface of every interaction in this society Rachel is a very complex and disturbed character  but I like it a lot  she made me feel vulnerable and exposed my own drunkenness right in the face with her own behavior  Megan remained me in some ways of my teenage years  when life was  easy  and at the same time full of darkness and complex decisions that affect the years to come  I met some crazy unsecure girls on those years and she made me think of them and their  new selves  today    did they really changed  Anna is the common  I ll go with the flow  girl that never thinks of the consequences  she was my least favorite  Paula Hawkins debut amazed me in many ways because it really puts your own thoughts and beliefs at stake    should we go trusting everything the  others  say  do  sell  project  I think in some way this book exposes and questions our own relationships and their development over the years Strong recommendation is you like strong stories that will shake the ground you walk by  with low moral unsecure characters that if they do not depress you  they will show you the very essence of the XXI century breakdown in society so you can learn something and maybe consider it for your own story Many thanks Paula  please write us another thriller soon    I love a good thriller  especially when the narrator is completely unreliable  3 narrators  one of them the victim  all built in with their own set of issues that make you question whether their point of view is actually the best one  I figured out the twist about 50 pages before the end  but still enjoyed every last page of this book  Definitely understand the hype  and would LOVE to see this on the big screen  To call this book  the next Gone Girl  is to do both books and both authors a disservice I enjoy Flynn s work very much  having read every book she has published thus far  Dark Places remains my personal favourite  THAT is a movie I ll brave the theatre to see  That said  I m not looking for another Gone Girl Read it  liked it  carried on  It stands on its own merit and is a great read  As is this book  I ve not encountered this author before but am looking forward to discovering more of her work  I found this story to be highly entertaining  although it took me a bit of perseverance to get far enough in to be hooked  Hawkins has a knack for creating utterly reprehensible yet realistic characters I can t really claim to have any affection for anyone in this book  I did  however  become invested in what happened to the protagonist  hot mess though she may be  In any case  this book is worth a read  even if you ve already tried it and given it up early on  Go back and try again  it picks up remarkably and evolves into a page turner quite quickly  What on earth should I read next    Where do I even begin about this book  I loved it of course as I have rated it 5 stars  This was a complex journey through the lives of people that seem so normal from the outside  But things are never what they seem  THERE WILL BE SOME SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT    The book is told through three different lives  Rachel  Megan and Anna  Rachel seems to be the alcoholic loser that can t get over her husband Tom leaving her  I feel very sorry for Rachel  All she wanted was to have a child with her husband  Because she wasn t able to conceive she went into a deep depression which turned her into an alcoholic  Her husband Tom was an a  hole who wouldn t help her in any way  He could have tried all kinds of counseling with her  but he leaves her  Of course this doesn t help with her drinking  She is just a sad person living with a woman named Cathy and trying to get by  She just can t cope over not having a child and losing her husband  It s been two years and she s just lost and drinking so much that she loses her job  But instead of telling Cathy this  she still rides the train every morning and evening  pretending she still has a job  This train just happens to go by her old house and she watches her ex husband with his new wife and baby  She also watches another couple a few houses down  She makes up names for them and dreams of their perfect life  It s a little bizarre  but so is life  The name of the couple in the house down from Rachel s old house is Megan and Scott  They are not the happy couple Rachel dreams they are  Megan is not happy with Scott and is having an affair  Scott is a bit of a control freak and scary  Rachel is always calling her ex trying to get him to come back to her  She shows up at their house sometimes  Just crazy things she does when she is drunk  One night she goes out there to see him but is so drunk she can t remember much of anything that happened  She knows she finds her way home with blood on her and that a man helped her up when she fell to the ground  She finds out the next day that Megan is missing  This takes us on a wild ride of Rachel trying to find out what happened to Megan  She was there that night where Megan was last seen  She wonders if she did something to her or if she saw someone that did  She blacked out and can t remember much at all  Rachel gets caught up in trying to find out this mystery  She stops calling and bothering her ex husband Tom as much since she s got something else to worry about  This makes Anna  Tom s wife  happier but she still has stress and hatred for Rachel  I have to say I didn t like Anna at all through the whole book  I thought she was a horrible person  When finding out she was having an affair with Rachel s husband the whole time just confirmed it  Then she eventually marries him  But not all is wonderful in this little world of people  Rachel befriends Megan s husband Scott trying to find out what is going on and help him with his pain  She told him Megan was seeing another man  her therapist  She s trying to keep the police from thinking he did it  The whole book has you wondering if Rachel might have killed Megan thinking she was Anna since they look similar in appearance  But then things start to fall into place and it s a dramatic ending that I didn t see coming  I loved the ending  I just loved it  Justice was done for all involved  in a sense  I loved this book and I hope to read more from this author  She did an awesome job  www melissa413readsalot blogspot com Though I saw the ending coming a mile away  I thought her interwoven first person structure and rich character development was five star all the way  An engrossing  dark  delightful read  loved the book told from 3 different women s the story of Rachael and her drinking problems who loses her husband to another women anna than loses her job  she is afraid to tell her flat mate about her job so she continues to take the train every day   when a women named megan comes up missing she knows who she is she seen her everyday from the train but the day before she seen a man kiss her but it wasn t her husband   because of her drinking the police feel she is not a reliable witness racheal remembers something but is confused by her drinking and and wonders what is real and what she dreamed    fast paced book and has twists you think you figured it out but than it catches wondering again           All girls are crazy but some guys are really crazy Utterly enticing   I thoroughly enjoyed the writing style  character development and plot  Simply Marvelous   This book kept me guessing the whole time and I love that  It s dark like Gone Girl and I didn t really like any of the narrators but the characters are fleshed out so well that I didn t even mind that  The main narrator is Rachel a divorced alcoholic who rides the train everyday so that her roommate doesn t know that she lost her job  She fantasizes about a couple that she sees every day from the train  When the woman turns up missing  she gets way too involved  The three narrators are all fairly unreliable and there are a few red herrings to throw you off track  I was left guessing for most of the book who the  bad guy  is and the final scenes are doozies  A brilliant must read  a definite page turner that left you wanting more each time you read  A brilliant ending for a brilliant book   Son raros los libros que hacen sentir nervioso al lector por lo que esta por venir  por lo que los personajes van a decir  a hacer  Pues este libro es uno de esos  Al principio me costo trabajo agarrarle el hilo a la historia y no terminaba de convencerme  pero de pronto algo magico paso  me atrapo y no me dejo salir hasta que termine  La novela esta contada desde tres mujeres diferentes  lo cual me confundio un poco cuando comence la lectura  Sin embargo  resulta muy interesante como se van desenvolviendo  interactuando entre ellos y revelando paulatinamente el misterio  que al final me resulto inesperado  Los personajes padecen una serie de trastornos que van desde la paranoia  el alcoholismo  los delirios  entre otros trastornos de la personalidad  y que vale la pena analizar desde el punto de vista psicologico   que los llevan a cometer actos que no les voy a contar  para que lo lean  pero que me mantuvieron muy atento por dias  Aunque el personaje principal es mas bien algo que nadie querria ser  la autora es tan buena que uno se llega a identificar con ella y sus disparates  Por algo este fue uno de los libros mas vendidos de 2015 a nivel mundial y gano el premio a mejor libro de misterio de ese ano  aunque es la obra debut de Paula Hawkins  Asi que si lo ven en la libreria  les aconsejo que lo compren  a mi me ha gustado  I looked forward to this novel and I was not disappointed  It held my interest throughout and had many twists and turns  For her debut novel  the author has written a thriller set in suburban London  Its protagonist  Rachel  is a very troubled  alcoholic train commuter who becomes familiar with the routines of people she watches daily along her route The chapters are alternating viewpoints of Rachel and two of the other main female characters  This is a novel I didn t want to put down  It was so suspenseful  I had no idea what would be happening next  It s impossible to discuss the plot without giving something away so I will say that I highly recommend it and give it 5 Stars  I loved this book  the characters and suspense  Loved it   Amazing   So intense  I HAD to give myself breaks  One of the best books I ve read in a long time  Loved it  Page turner   Its a good book  Its like reading a movie  Plot is good   it will hook you up til the end  Enjoy reading This book rocked my world  In addition to being a captivating psychological thriller who dunnit  that I couldn t put down  it reminds us of one of life s most important lessons  don t listen to what others tell you about a situation or a person  use your own judgement  Don t doubt yourself  If you spend time alone and believe in yourself  listening to your own voice  you will see exactly what is in front of you  Not the blurry falsehood that someone with their own agenda wants you to see  Great lines in the book  The workings of other people s families are always so impenetrable  The holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mold yourself through the gaps   If you re getting into the thriller mystery genre  this is a great book to start with  A bit slow at first as it introduces characters  but once the disappearance mystery is introduced it really pulled me in  The characters are all flawed  and some have very negative traits  but as the book goes on you begin to get more of their background story and start to either have more empathy for them or find them even more repulsive  The complex nature of these characters adds to the depth of the story  so it s a great book that challenges the reader to question the way they view people and human behavior in general  The different perspectives and time jumps also provide another layer and allows the reader to view the same situations differently  plus it also serves as a writing tool that helps the author tie everything together at the end   Very absorbing story about a young lady who travels the same route by train twice a day and starts to observe some things that interest and later alarm about a young couple whose home she passes  Her life is complicated by blackouts caused by alcohol abuse which cause her over the course of the novel to forget and question things that she sees  Ultimately a young lady is murdered and the heroine throws herself into the solving of this murder  I don t want to give too much away but it is a real page turner well worth your time   The Girl On The Train is a novel I ve been hearing a lot about recently  after reading it  I think its safe to say we will probably all be heaing a lot more about it The Girl On The Train is a thriller of the highest quality  Paula Hawkins writes excellently and you certainly wouldn t recognise this novel as a debut Rachel  The girl on the train  is a character only the extremely hard hearted wouldn t feel sorry for  Lonely  unemployed  depressed and an alcoholic  Rachel seeks comfort in her daily  commute  to work  so that her flatmate doesn t know she lost her job  where she makes up stories about the houses and strangers she sees   who doesn t  One day she sees one of her regular  friends  kissing a man who isn t her husband  Rachel feels saddened and angry by this  Although she doesn t know the couple that inhabit the house  only two doors down from where she used to live  she feels that she does  and she doesn t understand why someone would be so stupid as to to flaunt their dirty laundry in public As with most thrillers  things are not what they seem  and Rachel is not the only woman keeping secrets from her family and friends  When the woman goes missing sparking a massive man hunt  Rachel feels compelled to tell the Police what she saw  but will they believe an alcoholic prone to black outs  Or will Rachel find herself in more trouble that she could ever imagine The Girl On The Train is a novel told not just from Rachel s perspective but also that of two other women  but to tell you about them  would give a little more away about the plot than I would wish to  I want you all to read this amazing debut for yourselves  Wow  Nothing short of amazing  Every review you read says  Gone Girl this  and  Gone Girl that   but this book stands on it s own as an amazing piece of work  Yes  it has a similar storyline to that of Gone Girl  but it shouldn t deter you from reading it  I kept seeing it come up in my Recommended list  and always browsed past it  Now I want to read it again    Yeah  this is one of those books that reads one way the first time  then once you know the outcome  the entire book will feel new again and you can pick up on little things during a second read that you may have missed the first time around If you read at all  you MUST grab this book  Five stars  Would recommend it to anyone that can magically turn chunks of letters into words  READ IT  READ IT NOW  I am always a bit cautious when I see nothing but great reviews about a book   Will it be so hyped that I will expect too much  only to be disappointed when I put my own eyes on the written word  I put my name on the library waiting list facing months before I can borrow it  Then comes a colleague  with whom I discuss and recommend books   Read this  Read this  and he let me borrow his copy The Girl in the Train by Paula HawkinsIn the Hitchcock movie Rear Window  Jimmie Stewart was watching tenants in the other building from his apartment sitting in his wheelchair as he has nothing else to do while recovering from an accident Change the scenery to a London train  where Rachel on her daily commutes between home and work  passes a house  where a couple lives  She notices the house every day and imagines the names and lives of the couple One day Rachel has a fallout with her ex husband Tomas and his new wife Anna  while being drunk in the same area as the house  she watches from the train  She is so drunk that she has a blackout and therefore a hard time piecing events together afterwards It happens to be the same day where Megan is reported missing   the lady from the house she watches  Suddenly she remembers that she has observed something different at the house while passing it and shares it with the police  Sadly  her reputation as a drunk precedes her and she is not being taken seriously as the police discovers that her life is not what people believe it to be When I noticed the initial resemblance with one of my favorite Hitchcock movies I was doubted the success of the book  That was until the event of the book sucked me inside so I would not let go of the book until the last page turned  I totally get the hype about this book  READ IT I enjoyed this quick and easy read  The format of the story really makes you concentrate on the details  Well written and extremely entertaining   A book that creates such controversy as to whether it s like Gone Girl or not always makes me interested in checking it out  In not comparing this book to any other out there  I found The Girl on the Train to be a page turner and I spent too many nights staying up too late to get through more of it What appealed to me most was the fresh story idea  what we see from a monotonous train ride each day can change your life in extraordinary ways  if you get involved  if there s deceit  We should all be so lucky to put out a debut novel that generates this kind of attention  Great job  Paula Hawkins  Holy mind fuck batman  I was captivated from start to finish  This is a book you don t want to miss out on   definitely read it  In a debut novel from Paula Hawkins writing under her own name  The Girl on the Train is an incredibly woven  suspenseful and unique tale of psychological mystery  The novel is about Rachel  a recent divorcee with a penchant for drowning her depression in alcohol and who can t seem to get beyond her haunting past The story is told from the separate perspectives of both Rachel and Megan  a recently murdered woman  who are connected by random events that never brought the women together during Megan s life  but left them inseparable after Megan s death  I especially enjoyed this novel because there were many striking aspects with which I was able to relate  given some of my recent life experiences  and I felt myself quite in tune with the hardship Rachel is going through  Rachel is drowning in failure  heartache  depression  shame  financial hardship and her paramount weakness  alcohol But what makes the novel so truly incredible is the complexity of the tale  its unusual circumstances and the tapestry Paula Hawkins creates in developing a mysterious tragedy of heartache and deceit that rivals any I ve previously read This book is a definite must read  but get yourself ready for a roller coaster ride of a story  The Girl on the Train  is the first book I ve read  in a very long time  that has lived up to its hype  This is an engaging and entertaining story  well written  and perfectly paced  The emotional involvement with the characters is unavoidable   a dark thriller that is hard to put down  Hmmm  I have a lot of thoughts  First off  you know I LOVE an unreliable narrator  and Rachel reminds me most of the narrator of A Kind of Intimacy by Jenn Ashworth  These books actually have many similarities  domestic suspense  unlikable and unreliable female narrators  unrequited love desperation  British ness    Which brings me to another point    this book is not any better than Jenn Ashworth  or many other British mysteries I have read    Sophie Hannah jumps to mind  And it is not as good as Tana French  Denise Mina  or Kate Atkinson  as contemporary exemplars of this genre  So I m not sure why this book has received such a hard marketing push  unless it is just all about finding the next Gone Girl  That said  I did enjoy the book very much  I did indeed read it  compulsively   as they say  It sucks you right in with enough twists and drama to keep you involved in what is ultimately a novel of narrators rather than action  The split narration and timelines are effective  Its all well crafted  There are some heights for the writing    Rachel s Sylvia Plath comparison is particularly effective and memorable  Tom s character is well drawn    as a woman who attracts men who are attracted to damage  I definitely know that type  The groundwork prepares you for a final third that could seem way ott in another novel  I found Megan s passages to be the most chilling    her recounting the death of her child was haunting and brutal  Again  lay the right groundwork for the emotional fireworks of the final third  The relationships were well drawn and identifiable    I felt viscerally for Rachel in the scene where she and Tom meet in the car and she thinks there might be another chance    who doesn t recognize that feeling  So  Does it do anything new  No  Does it do all the old cliches very well  Absolutely  Whew  what a wild and crazy ride  Similar to Gone Girl  if you like dark murder mystery character studies it s definitely worth a read   Loved it  It definitely held my interest  even though a few characters seemed obnoxious   Good thriller that keeps you reading way past your bedtime  Quando mi sono avvicinata agli psycho thriller  nel mio caso ho iniziato con  L attesa  di Samantha Hayes  sono rimasta subito intrigata dalle trame e dal fatto che era impossibile capire se quello che leggevi era vero o meno  visto che spesso i narratori sono inattendibili a causa dei loro problemi psicologici  Dopo aver letto  l attesa  e aver trovato un sacco di incongruenze con la  rivelazione  sono rimasta delusa  chiedendomi se non fosse il problema di tutti i libri del genere  ma non mi sono arresa  cosi ho iniziato  They All Fall Down   etichettato come psycho thriller   ma che di psicologico aveva ben poco e che ho valutato con quattro stelline per il semplice fatto che non riuscivo a smettere di leggerlo e che alla fine la trama filava  Poi mi sono imbattuta ne  la ragazza del treno  e in alcune recensioni in cui si parlava dell inattendibilita delle tre narratrici donne  inutile dire che la curiosita e salita alle stelle  Tuttavia ho aspettato a causa del rating basso su Amazon Italia  ma non potevo resistere a quella trama  cosi l ho iniziato senza troppe aspettative    e finalmente ho trovato quello che mi aspettavo da uno psycho thriller  Un libro che scorre e che ti spinge ad andare avanti per capire se quello che dicono le narratrici e vero o meno  L alternarsi dei POV non fa altro che aggiungere curiosita a tutto il mistero  nessuno dei tre e banale o noioso  nessuno ti fa venire voglia di saltarlo per passare a quello di un altra delle tre  anzi  probabilmente tutto il contrario  ne vorresti di piu e un po  ti dispiace passare ad un altro POV  ma bastano poche righe e sei di nuovo immersa nella lettura  Poi boom il colpo di scena assolutamente inaspettato  per me  e la mia faccia era cosi o_O tutto si ribalta  tutto cambia e  a quel punto  anche volendo  non puoi mettere giu il libro fino alla fine  Girata l ultima pagina sono rimasta solo con un grande senso di soddisfazione  niente  bello  ma     o  wow  ma   solo la voglia di scrivere questa recensione per invogliarvi a leggerlo  perche veramente vale la pena e YOU WON T SEE IT COMING  Ci sono in incongruenze o buchi di trama  Non saprei  forse qualcuno  L unica pecca certa  in alcuni punti  e la traduzione palesemente sbagliata  Per il resto  merita tutto il successo che ha avuto  I don t often read mysteries but read  Gone Girl  and ended up enjoying it a lot  I decided to read  The Girl on the Train  after hearing that it was similar to  Gone Girl   They do have their similarities  especially the writing style of the authors  which I very much like  One big difference for me though  was that I figured out  Gone Girl  quite early in the book    Girl on the Train  had me puzzling over it until only about 50 pages left  Paula Hawkins does a wonderful job with character development  The main characters aren t very likable but they are so alive and real  that you can t help but like them  as much as you dislike them  I felt like I knew Rachel and Anna personally  and that always makes for a great read  I m very pleased I read this book   Lee la resena completa en  http   oceanodelibros blogspot com es  De que trata Rachel es una mujer que viaja todas las mananas en el tren de las 8 04 para ir a trabajar a Londres  desde su asiento contempla el paisaje y observa con detenida atencion  tanto es asi que en un tramo en el que se detiene el tren observa siempre a una pareja  Poco a poco Rachel imagina la vida de ellos  le pone hasta nombres  Ahora hay un asesinato y quizas ella sea la unica que podria conocer la verdad La verdad es que he pensado mucho en esta resena  quizas por ello voy a ser breve porque si me pusiera a contaros demasiado os estropearia el libro y creo que cuanto menos desvele sera mucho mejor  conservaremos esa intriga La sinopsis nos deja con el dato de que hay un asesinato y Rachel Watson  la protagonista de esta historia es la unica que podria aclararlo  Rachel es una mujer tocada por el sufrimiento  hace poco que se acaba de divorciar y ahoga sus penas en el alcohol  como una especie de via de escape se inventa vidas desde su asiento en el tren que le lleva cada manana al trabajo La novela esta narrada en primera persona no solo por un personaje sino que son tres  Rachel  Megan y Anna  Tres personajes fundamentales que se entrelazaran poco a poco en el relato y que tienen mucho en comun y que ver en la historia Sin duda de todos los personajes me quedo con Rachel porque la pobre es como un perrito apaleado  donde le dan por todas partes  En ocasiones te dan ganas de matarla por seguir como sigue y en otras te da una pena terrible por ella  Con esto no estoy diciendo que sea buena  eso lo debeis de averiguar vosotros  Del resto de personajes  tenemos a Tom  el exmarido de Rachel y su esposa Anna  Y a los vecinos que observa desde el tren  Megan y Scott La ambientacion con pocos recursos se logra y nos envuelve en ese halo de misterio  a traves del dia a dia de Rachel nos sumergimos de lleno en una vida a punto de arruinarse por completo y otra inventada en busca de un pequeno alivio  La trama es un no parar  poco a poco iremos intentando descubrir la cara que corresponde al asesino o asesina  cada uno de los tres personajes es crucial para ir desenredandola  son tres puntos de vista interesantes para la historia Hasta las ultimas cien paginas no os quedara claro quien puede ser el asesino  asi que estaremos en perpetua tension y con la mosca detras de la oreja y desconfiando de todo el mundo hasta casi el final  Es de esos libros con los que estas unos cuantos dias dandole a a la cabeza y pensando Voy a resumir esta novela en cuatro frases y acabo esta resena Intriga constante Tan interesante que no pararas de leer Me atrapo Teneis que leerlo  I really enjoyed this book since the style of telling this story was so different  Parted into  morning  and  evening  sessions it was always exciting to read what has happened during the night or during the day  It was interesting to read the views of Rachel  Megan and Anna and be able to slowly put the clues together to find out who the murderer ist  To be honest  I had two people in mind and I wasn t too far off with it  Also  I liked the characters  Yes  Rachel was annoying at times and I wanted to lock away the wine when she decided to get some more  Anna was hysterical most of the times  Megan bitchy and  what  I don t care    ish  But you can tell that all three woman are behaving because of reasons  I at least could feel with each of them  No matter how bad and irresponsible they were  I m not saying I m okay with it   I just see reason WHY they are behaving like this  It was interesting to read And since I really enjoyed reading this book  it gets 5 out of 5 stars  xo Holy shit  An incredibly skillful use of an unreliable narrator  Although this book contains a mystery  I think its greatest strength is in the character studies  how we lie to others and to ourselves  and the variety of methods that we use to do so  Not an upbeat book  for sure  and yet not exactly depressing  Somehow  there s a certain beauty and grace in the sheer humanness of the flawed and complex characters  I found this to be extremely well written and  as an utterly fascinating read  it has made the shortlist of my favorite books  1  Omgomgomgomgomgomg2  I seriously couldn t put this book down  I would think about it in my purse and long for the moment we were back together 3  I got so scared at one point that it was physically painful for me to turn the next page  I turned it so slowly and then turned the book facedown and took a bathroom break to build up nerve to start reading again 4  It was just genius  Telling the story with three different women s perspective  the jump between morning and evening and different dates  not giving us a story from beginning to end but rather in pieces  every character being a little off so you don t really know whodunnit until the end  You had your guesses and you were pretty sure but you are never REALLY sure  Ugh  So good  5  I also love that so much of the story is just the train and the neighborhood  You became one with this setting  And you also just wanted to walk the streets of Witney  6  The baby in the tub  Nononono  I had to stop reading there  too  7  What makes a book so readable for me  The dialog was great in this  the mystery pushes you along  the insider view of crazy lives does as well 8  Just read it  So good  Starts out giving very little information and just keeps building and building until it completely sucks you in  One of the best books I have read in quite a while  This book is excellent  I was hooked from the moment I started  I listened to the audio version and the women they had reading each of the three main characters helped to bring it to life  unlike other audiobooks that have the same narrator the whole way through  The major ending twist was a little predictable and I had it figured out before they got there  but it was still worth going on just to see how the women in the plot dealt with it  They did an excellent job of developing the two main women in the story  Rachel and Megan   the third could have had a little more depth  Anna   All the same  the ability to relate to the character s faults and desires and to root for them when they are struggling made me sad to have the book end  and for that I gave it 5 stars   Hard to put down  a real page turner    dark and chilling but a great read       4 5    5    O son    Gercekten harikaydi  O katil cikan arkadas varya    Asiri sinir oldum suan spoiler vermeyeyim adini soyleyip Cogu kisiye ilk 150 sayfasi sikici gelmis bana gore de oyleydi acikcasi ama kitabi bu yuzden birakan cok kisi var ama bence sakin birakmayin  Ben acikcasi katili tahmin edememistim  Zaten kitap sonlari tahmin etmede de fazla iyi oldugum soylenemez  Ben kitabi

degistiriyorum  Benim kitaba puanim 4 5 fakat tam puan vermem gerektigi icin iki saattir 4 ile 5 arasinda gidip geliyorum ve sonuc olarak 5 puan veriyorum cunku yarim puancik fazla vermekten zarar gelmez     Ayni zamanda sunu soylemeden gecemeyecegim  Ithaki Yayinlari na tesekkur ediyorum bu muhtesem kapak icin  Favori kapaklarima girdi bile     A Gone Girl type book  I liked it and at the same time didn t like the characters but good ending  I m glad I listened to this on a long road trip  It started pretty slow and I might of given up on it  I m glad I didn t  It really got good and I enjoyed trying to figure it out along the way  Well done   Zuerst ein Hinweis  Ich habe dieses Buch im englischen Original von Randomhouse UK als Rezensionsexemplar zur Verfugung gestellt bekommen und gelesen  Daher kann ich keine Aussage treffen uber die Qualitat der deutschen Ubersetzung  Da ich vom Ubersetzer Christoph Gohler jedoch schon andere exzellente Ubersetzungen gelesen habe  habe ich vollstes Vertrauen  Man hort immer wieder  dass Paula Hawkins mit Gillian Flynn verglichen wird  und  The girl on the train  mit deren Bestseller  Gone Girl   Da Gillian Flynn zu meinen absoluten Lieblingsautorinnen gehort  konnte ich es mir naturlich nicht entgehen lassen  selber zu vergleichen Und  Ist da was dran  Meiner Meinung nach ja    Und nein  Ja  denn auch Paula Hawkins bedient sich eines ganz bestimmten Stilmittels sehr gekonnt  das Gillian Flynn bis zur Perfektion beherrscht  das des unzuverlassigen Erzahlers  Die Geschichte wird aus Sicht dreier ganz unterschiedlicher Frauen erzahlt  aber man kann sich als Leser niemals blind auf das verlassen  was sie sagen  Sie belugen sich selbst oder werden von anderen belogen  sie vertrauen auf eine Wahrheit  die so gar nicht existiert  oder erschaffen sich selber eine kleine heile Traumwelt    Das ist unglaublich clever geschrieben   und spannend  denn man will unbedingt herausfinden  was wirklich hinter all dem Lug und Trug steckt  Ja  denn auch Paula Hawkins ist eine Meisterin darin  uber egoistische  zutiefst gestorte Frauen zu schreiben  mit denen man aber dennoch irgendwie mitfuhlen kann   und sogar muss    Ich habe unzahlige Male laut aufgestohnt  wenn Rachel die falsche Entscheidung traf  denn entgegen jeder Vernunft wollte ich so sehr  dass sie ihr Leben in den Griff bekommt und es fur sie ein Happy End gibt   Nein  nein  nein  bitte tu das nicht     war ein immer wieder kehrendes Mantra  Ich fand die Protagonisten und Protagonistinnen grossartig  mit all ihren charakterlichen Schwachen  emotionalen Wunden und moralischen Fragwurdigkeiten  Ja  es gibt in dieser Geschichte einen Kriminalfall  aber das Buch ist dennoch kein typischer Krimi oder Thriller  Die Seiten habe ich nicht wirklich deswegen umgeblattert  um das Verbrechen aufgeklart zu sehen  sondern weil ich so viele Emotionen in die Charaktere investiert hatte und sehen wollte  wohin die Reise sie fuhrt  Krimi  Thriller  Drama     Ich weiss es nicht so genau  aber was immer es ist  es ist in meinen Augen fantastisch Ja  denn auch die Atmosphare unterschwelligen Unheils  die Paula Hawkins mit eindringlichen Bildern und einem packenden Schreibstil heraufbeschwort  ist Lesern von Gillian Flynn vertraut  Warum also das nein  Nein   The girl on the train  ist nicht  Gone Girl 2 0   denn obwohl die Atmosphare ahnlich ist und die Autorinnen sich auch ahnlicher Stilmittel bedienen  haben die Handlungen beider Romane nur auf den ersten Blick oberflachliche Gemeinsamkeiten  Meiner Meinung nach handelt es sich hier um zwei ganz unterschiedliche Bucher  die beide auf ihre eigene Art und Weise aussergewohnlich und mehr als lohnend sind Ich wurde es so ausdrucken  zwei Maler konnen die gleichen Pinsel  die gleichen Farben und sogar die gleichen Maltechniken verwenden und doch ganzlich andere Bilder malen  Die Geschichte von  The girl on the train  ist originell und spielt augenzwinkernd mit den Erwartungen erfahrener Thriller Leser Die Handlung erstreckt sich uber mehrere Zeitebenen  und so bekommt man als Leser immer neue Bruchstucke aus Vergangenheit und Gegenwart zu sehen  kann dabei aber nie mit Sicherheit sagen  was jetzt Ursache ist und was Wirkung    Ich habe immer wieder neue Theorien aufgestellt  was wirklich geschehen sein konnte und warum  wer hier die Guten sind und wer die Bosen   und im Endeffekt war dann doch alles ganz anders  Der Schreibstil der Autorin hat mir sehr gut gefallen  Besonders gelungen fand ich  wie sie den drei Erzahlerinnen ihre ganz eigenen  unverwechselbaren  Stimmen  gibt  Fazit  Traue niemandem  nicht einmal dir selbst   das konnte das Motto dieses Buches sein  Drei Frauen  die alle nicht das sind  was sie zu sein scheinen  und deren Schicksale durch Liebe und Verrat miteinander verknupft sind  erzahlen eine Geschichte  die irgendwo zwischen Thriller und Drama ihren dunklen Sog entfaltet Die Autorin wird oft mit der Bestsellerautorin Gillian Flynn verglichen   und muss den Vergleich nicht scheuen  denn sie hat in meinen Augen ein ganz aussergewohnliches Buch geschrieben  Fascinating and terrifically entertaining story about a woman whose life is rather on the skids from alcohol who takes the train each day and likes to look out the window  imagining things about those she observes  One day  she sees something that bothers her  and what happens to her and those around her after the incident propels the story into many surprising different paths  The reader is never quite sure if the main character  Rachel  knows what she is talking about when she describes things in her life  The ending  which had me glued to each page  explains everything in a tense  thrilling fashion  What is most surprising about the book is that none of the major characters are likeable  including Rachel  but the story is so gripping that  like in Gone Girl  it doesn t detract from the story  It s rare that a book can pull that off  This one does  big time  Very highly recommended   4 5 stars  more likely    There s nothing so painful  so corrosive as suspicion    I admit  I had a fear this book is overrated  but on contrary  it s more than satisfying  This is a fine psychological thriller with an interesting twist I didn t see coming  Hawkins does a great job in digging inside protagonist s head and making the story believable  This book follows Rachel  Megan and Anna leading their dysfunctional lives  each in their own way  The truth is not one character has redeeming qualities and I hated every single one of them  Honestly  this is the book s strongest virtue   the ability to absolutely loathe all characters  but at the same time to care for the plot At Rachel s old house  her ex husband lives with his new wife and their daughter  Near them live Megan and Scott  whose marriage Rachel thinks of as everything she wants and everything she s lost  If you dig deeper  you see Megan and Scott s bond isn t that healthy  Firstly  I thought Megan just ran away with a lover  Then I thought Rachel had something to do with her disappearance and she fails to remember it  My last wrong presumption was that Anna hurt her  I never guessed the real bad guy  Rachel is hopelessly lonely  drowning the sorrows of her failed marriage with canned gin and tonic and endless bottles of wine  She has lost her job because of her everlasting intoxication  but rather than telling her roommate  she keeps on taking the train into London every day  pretending to go to work  Actually  she just gets drunk in different places  Megan goes missing  the same day Rachel had seen her kissing the other man  Of course  Rachel saw it all from the train  The next morning  Rachel wakes up and feels something is terribly wrong  but fails to remember the night before This book is a page   turner  at first you wonder what has happened to Megan  and then who did it  Throughout the book I kept guessing who is the most dangerous among them  Truth be told  they ARE ALL horrible characters  The plot builds sensibly until you desperately want to know the truth  Everything is precisely plotted and not one single chapter feels like a filler  carefully describing one unreliable narrator after another  These three women are so flawed and foolish  representing everything a dignified woman wouldn t want to be  As much as it is extremely hard to empathize with them  it s so easy to fall in love with the book in general  Rachel is a stalker who doesn t respect other people s privacy  As much as she irritated me  her issues and her mental development kept me going through the novel  The reader goes through all stages of alcohol abuse and overall dysfunction  It gets strenuous at times  but in the end there is a reason why she s so broken and it might not be her fault entirely    I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts    Yes  Rachel  like you weren t   following your heart  while stalking Tom and his wife  which made her constantly anxious  Ugh  she truly is a horrible protagonist  She keeps relaying on other people s pity towards her even though she s ashamed of it  It s so frustrating to read   Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful physical contact with another person  just a hug or a heartfelt squeeze of my hand  and my heart twitches    I despise Rachel  She was drowning in her self pity and even she kept on making things even worse  She knew she was a burden to her roommate Katie and she had no will to change it  I don t even believe she had a true intention of dealing with her alcoholism  Megan is self centered  attention whore and selfish to the bone  She has borderline personality disorder and lives double life  Being dependent on male attention  she s attracted only to unstable men with a tendency to be agressive    I can t do this  I can t just be a wife  I don t understand how anyone does it    there is literally nothing to do but wait  Wait for a man to come home and love you  Either that or look around for something to distract you    Megan was the best narrator of all three women and at moments I think I liked her  She made fatal mistakes in her past and was utterly cruel  but her inner struggles were compelling to me  It s too bad she couldn t be happy with herself Anna is paranoid of Rachel  fragile and submissive  She enjoys in building her happiness in other s sorrow and she refuses to accept that the same can happen to her  Even though she is generally happy  she isn t completely satisfied with being only a wife and a mother   I m trying to process this right now  All I can say is that y all should definitely read this  It will keep you on the edge of your seat  I really recommend this  Libro assolutamente fantastico  da leggere  Finito in pochi giorni mi ha tenuta sveglia varie notti  la storia e avvincente e i personaggi sono credibili tanto da catturarti e renderti partecipe del racconto  Scritto davvero bene  si merita il successo ottenuto   What the F    did I just read Seriously  I feel like I m sitting in the middle of these people  watching their stories play out  And as they go along  their tales begin to twist and turn until I find myself in a knot with only one solution  but I m not sure it s actually the correct solution Told from three points of view  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  this story is about a murder  a divorce  a drunkard  a liar and a mystery of how they all connect  It starts simple  A tale too easy to figure out  Emotions begin to be fiddled with  You re feeling wretched and sorry for one character  hateful and vengeful towards another  And then  FLIP A FEW PAGES OVER  and you don t feel anything like you did  Everything you thought you knew  from what these characters told you  turns out to be entirely wrong  But not entirely  But your original thought was right  That s how this story just twists you until you re lost int he forest with no bread crumbs to help lead you out That is why this story is worth a read  I ve not been on this confusing path in a while I m still trying to figure out the GONE GIRL comparisons  Outside of very unreliable narrators  there just isn t a link  Both great reads Read THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN if you are looking for something to f    with your head  because this will do it  and do it very well   There is no  normal  people in this world  I thought  More or less this is true  I think  This book was a page turner  Ending was better than Gone Girl  but the same excitement  Great read  nqdr nqwl nh rwy  mn ldb lnasy y  lktb  syd   lshkhSyt lry ysy  fy lrwy  tlt sydt  w ltlt  byqwmw bdwr lrwy w l narrator blDf  lkd lrwy  btwSf msh r ltlt sydt dwl bmnth  ldq

Besides the fact that both have the word  girl  in it s title and that they both are in the same genre which is psychological thriller  that couldn t be farther from the truth  To me that s almost like saying all psychological thrillers are just like Gone Girl and we all know that s the furtherest thing from the truth  Amy Elliott Dunne in Gone Girl thoroughly plotted out her crime until she couldn t anymore  The crime that happened in The Girl on the Train happened due to inconvenience and wasn t planned in the least bit  The Girl on the Train was a good read  yes  even through it s not the next  Gone Girl    I listened to the audible  and I have to say that in the beginning  I did find it difficult to figure out who was who  since the book was told in many POV s  I did have to jot down who everyone was at first  so I wouldn t get confused but after that hurdle  I found it smoother to listen to  As many would think from the title  that the book all took place on the train but that s simply not true after reading the first couple of chapters you quickly figure that out  It s more like what was seen on the train and by who    and can that memory be trusted   Mistrust in this book goes beyond that of one s tainted memory but to all the characters who all at one point or another do not trust each other Like many people  Rachel Watson intently observes life around her  Mainly through the vision of a lonely  angry  and bitter ex wife  but also through the eyes of an alcoholic  Through the haze of her curiosity which blur unto downright nosiness  which in all honesty  actually goes beyond the normalcy of just watching life s surroundings  she meddles  she pokes her nose where it doesn t belong  she has a hard time grasping what s really happened during the crime she partially witnessed  Sometimes grief and pain cloud peoples  judgements and they act out in ways you least expect  the author did an excellent job of portraying these characteristic s in Rachel  This book did leave me on the edge of my seat often  Once I thought  I knew what was going to happen the chapter changed and it was on to the next person s point of view that had nothing to do with the last s persons  When I did figure out who did it  I still found myself intrigued on what was going to happen next   Bloody brilliant  Everything was bloody brilliant  The writing  the characters  the plot  everything  The character development is awesome  and the characters are layered  each with its own demons  fears  dreams    You never know who you can trust  and the author keeps you guessing on who is a killer and who trustworthy  For a more keen reader  the key to solving the mystery is there  but hidden in a massive amount of threads that never allows you to be 100  sure of anything  The ending might be a bit cliche  but it fits the story very well  A must read for everyone    Wow  This mystery kept me guessing the whole way through  I loved how Hawkins rotated the perspective among the female leads  She developed the character of Rachel so well  the reader learned more and more about her as she was discovering more about herself  Well done  http   viajarpelaleitura blogspot pt     I had heard mixed reviews of this book from friends  so even though it was on my bookshelf  I hesitated reading it  I really like it though  It was definitely written different from 3 women s point of view and sometimes I wanted to smack Rachel  the main character  but I love the way the story was told from the different perspectives  It more than kept my interest and ask usual I went back and forth on who the killer was  sure I knew each time until something else was revealed  That  to me  is the sign of a good book  wowzers I got The Girl on The Train for my birthday last week and I devoured it  All I wanted to do was read this book  I took it to the gym  I stayed up way too late reading it and I took it into the bath and read until the water was cold  it was that captivating The story follows three women and is told in morning and evening segments  following the timetable for the commuter train in and out of London  Between the made up fantasies  the love triangles  the mental breakdowns  and the struggle to be a better person this book just gives and gives So while it s a mystery thriller  it isn t scary or gory  There s a lot of psychology involved and the reader really gets to delve into the minds of the narrators  there are three  and see why they make the decisions they do  I really liked that added depth I also found it interesting that  in my opinion at least  there is no clear protagonist  Yes  there are main characters of course  but I despised and adored each character at some point throughout the book  You hate the decisions they make and then you love some insight they have on the world  You are certain they re just totally screwed up and then you find out what triggered it and you re empathetic to their choices  This book has so many layers  and each one was crafted to fit with the others beautifully  And I loved all the back stories and character development I was honestly sad when I finished this book  I had to detox from reading for a few days before I could start another because I was in mourning that I had finished it  Usually  I read books that have gotten a lot of hype  either award winners or NYT bestsellers  and I am disappointed because they never live up to the hype  but The Girl on The Train most definitely deserves every bit of praise that it has received  Plus  you don t figure out the killer until the very end I m hoping that someone writes a really artsy indie screenplay and turns this story into a brilliant mini series or a movie  It deserves so much more than to be a fluffy studio production If you haven t read this book yet go buy it  download it  or check it out from the library  If you already own it  drop everything you re doing  bookmark your current book and start this one http   www magnoliasandsunlight com 2    I d like to give this a 4 1 2 but  as I can t  will go with 5 based on my interest in the story and the way the author was able to weave all the characters and details together into an intricate tapestry of mystery  flawed characters  and hidden agendas  Though none of the characters were likeable  their behaviors had me reacting with an emotional repulsion and brought the story close to me  I kept getting confused with the dates of the character entries and my constant turning back in the book to get on track with the timeline detracted about a half star from my liking it completely  But it was compelling and fascinating  which was frustrating to me when I had no time for it once I d begun  Once I did  it was a day spent with it in my lap  If you liked Gone Girl  you ll like The Girl On The Train  If you didn t like Gone Girl  I d say you should pass it by   I absolutely loved this book  The Girl On the Train is definitely a must read for 2015  It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time because I didn t know what was going to happen next  I thought this book was so well written  and I loved seeing many different people s perspectives  I was so surprised by the ending  This is a book that I will read over and over again even though the ending won t be a surprise anymore On my blog  I created an English Toffee Pudding based on this book  Find it at my link text  Just wow  This was really awesome  I loved the different perspectives and trying to keep track of what was real and what you weren t sure about  This kept me reading and on the edge of my seat  So tense  the alcoholic character is so deep  astounding story  impatient to reverse the page to reveal the truth  I am a people watcher  I find it very entertaining to watch people as they go on with their everyday  mundane tasks  I think a lot of people do this  The Girl on the Train explores this practice and what can happen if you take it much too far  Rachel is struggling to keep her head above water after her husband leaves her for another woman  and she loses her job because of her alcohol problem  In order to avoid having to tell her roommate that she has lost her job  Rachel continues taking the commuter train into London every day  where she people watches and drinks excessively  Every day on the train  she passes by the street where she shared a home with her ex husband  and sees a couple just a few doors down that she becomes enthralled with  She imagines their perfect life and love  all from her seat on the train  But one morning she sees something at their home that shocks her and crushes her fantasy of their perfect life  and the next day the wife  Megan  disappears Because of her drinking problem  Rachel often has blackouts  She begins having flashbacks to the night that Megan went missing  and realizes that she was in their neighborhood on the night of the crime  As she tries to put the pieces together  she begins entangling herself in the investigation  And everyone  including herself  seems capable of doing harm to Megan I m not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that this is one of the best psychological thrillers that I have ever read  I absolutely did not want to put it down  This book contained three very  very flawed narrators  Rachel   the girl on the train  Anna    the other woman   now married to Rachel s ex  and Megan   the girl who has disappeared without a trace   who were all at times intensely unlikable  and yet I felt sympathetic towards each of them  As all of the pieces of the mystery kept coming together  I really did not know who possibly could have been responsible for Megan s disappearance  And my theory on  whodunnit  changed about a dozen times throughout the course of the book  all leading up to the shocking and satisfying conclusion  I cannot recommend this book highly enough This review also appears on my blog  Reading Rachael  After so much hype about this book  I thought I d better read it myself  I found myself unable to put it down and read it voraciously until I had finished it  I did find it a bit confusing at times with which character was which and which year I was in and found myself going back to the beginning of the chapters to find out  but overall I found the book very enjoyable  extremely page turning and I couldn t wait to find out the ending   In my humble opinion it did live up to the hype and I would recommend it to anybody  A great book  A missing person mystery  turning in to a murder mystery  told from the viewpoints of three different women  First Rachel  who commuted to London every weekday  and  when her train stops at the lights as it does nearly every day  fantasizes about the lives of the people she sees living in the houses by the train line  Then we have the lives of two of the women who live in the street beside the train line  All of them are damaged in one way or another  Then we have their husbands  who are sometimes not very nice people    Now one of them goes missing      And Rachel thinks she can help because she thinks she saw  Rear Window style  an incriminating event  But the police find her an unreliable witness  alcoholic  blackout prone      Should she insert herself into the investigation  Will that help or hinder  The story is rivetingly told  at great pace  in the three voices  all in the present tense  as the mystery unfolds  I liked it a lot   This book is not for the squeamish  It will make you squirm   tense up  be scared  be angry   say WTF more than once  No one is how they appear  They all have secrets Read this book of if you are a fan of books written in the style of Gone Girl  The Silent Wife by A S Harrison  Always Watching by Chevy Stevens  A Circle Of Wives by Alice LaPlante   The Dark Tide and Into The Darkest Corner by Elizabeth Haynes   Incredible writing   1st person throughout the book    couldn t put it down   read it in a day    4 5 starsvery intriguing  it s like a Hitchcock film  thought the end wasn t as mindblowing as I expected it to be WOW  Loved it   One of the most interesting books I ve read in terms of plot twists and unexpected endings  I ve heard this book compared to a second rate version of Gone Girl  but I thought it was a better read  Phenominal mystery taking place in the U K  A woman is introduced who is taking a train in the morning from the suburbs of London into the city  and then  at the end of the day  back to the suburbs  As she passes a particular location  she most often sees a married couple in front of their home and they re obviously a loving couple As the book progresses  we discover that the woman  Rachel  was previously married and her husband  Tom  left her for another woman  Anna  The woman that Rachel usually sees from the train  Megan  goes missing  and Rachel gets involved in the mystery of what happened to her  Complicating things is that both Megan and Anna live a few doors from each other  and Anna lives in the home that Rachel lived in when she was married to Tom  Rachel started drinking at the end of her marriage and can t remember past events  but something happened to Rachel that can shed a light as to what happened to Megan Each of the three women take turns in giving their stories  and it s almost written in diary format  Extremely interesting and very well done as events slowly unfold  You feel you get into the essence of each character as they bare their feelings throughout the story   The Girl on the Train  takes character development to a whole new level  The three females that narrate the book add so much dynamic to the story  I love a good psychological thriller and  The Girl on the Train  didn t disappoint  Paula Hawkins is a fantastic writer who kept me glued to her pages  If you re a fan of dark twisted storytelling look no further  the train has arrived   OMG this book was AWESOME  First and foremost as a HUGE fan of The Killers  I love you Paula Hawkins for mentioning them in this book  LOL  Now on with the review  I m not going to post any spoilers so a short one from me  I decided to read this book purely based on the title  I didn t read the blurb going in and the opening paragraphs hooked me straight away  This is a psychological thriller and it does not disappoint  If you love a mystery or a whodunnit  then this book deserves a read  It has multiple POVs which are very easy to grasp and understand It has characters that are relatable and likeable  and of course a few villainous ones too  I did liken it to Gone Girl but in my opinion this is better  I adored that this was set in the UK  I felt it made this book so much better for me as a Brit  I was smiling often as I read things that were very relatable  This book definitely jumped into my  favourite books  shelf   Could not put it down    This was narrated by  and full of  crazy characters which made for an impossible to put down read  Loved it  Cogunlukla okula metroyla giderken oturma imkanim olduysa okudum  Son hizlanan bolumleri evde bugun bitirdim ve iyi ki evde okumusum  Yuz ifademi normal tutamazmistim   Yorum yakinda  umarim  bir bosluk bulabildigimde  gelecek    Solo he leido otro libro con un tipo de redaccion como esta  y fue  La Decision mas Dificil   My Sister s Keeper  y aunque la primera persona es un poco fastidiosa  te atrapa    hasta el punto que me lo lei en dos dias  creo que es un record personal  jaja   Excelente    Definitivamente hay que leerlo  This was a great psychological mystery  It starts off with the narration by two women on to a whole cast of characters  Twists and turns leaving one with doubts about all concerned  A surprise ending and a great mystery  You must read this if you like suspense  This is indeed a fast paced thriller  it will keep you guessing until the very end  And what s so creepy about this is the fact that the characters seem all too real  Why  Because they could be anyone you know  Your neighbor  your cousin  your friend  Every person has a limit  for tolerance  patience  anger  violence  And if any one of us gets to that point and we black out in anger  in fury  who s to say what we would be capable of doing  This is depressing if you take it too seriously but I have to commend Paula Hawkins  she maneuvered the story so wonderfully that you don t know who is wrong and right  who is good or bad  But isn t that what s at our very core as human beings  We can be both good and bad  we have flaws  as well as commendable character traits  In the end  it s what we do with those traits that makes us good or bad  It s the choices we make that make us criminals or law abiding citizens  Read  read  read it  Could not put it down  This book is told from three different perspectives  Rachel is an alcoholic who rides the train to and from London every day  watching the houses and imagining the peoples  lives  Megan is one of those people  and she spends every day fighting within her own head about what to do    does she still likes her husband  or should she run away  Anna is the new wife of Tom  Rachel s ex husband  They live in Rachel s old house with their baby girl  Evie  Rachel  depressed with how her life has turned out  spends her days drinking  usually ending with making a rude  drunken call to Tom One day  Rachel sees Megan s face in the news    she s gone missing  Rachel has to battle her blackouts    she knows she saw something important  but she can t remember  She knows she has to help This book  widely regarded as the next  Gone Girl   is a psychological thriller  It s a strange feeling  as a reader  when the main character is such an unlikeable woman who is unwilling to help herself  However  with more and more information  more revelations  you begin to see why she is how she is  She has to fight for herself  for people to believe her  to have purpose in the world   The Girl on the Train  is a solid thriller and I will definitely be reading any future books from Paula Hawkins  brilliant OMG  this book is fantastic  I had LOVED Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn so when I heard that The Girl on the Train is just like it  but faster paced  creepier and darker  you couldn t imagine my excitement  I was jumping up and down my bed and dancing around my room when I finally got my hands on the book     And Paula Hawkins delivered  Enter Rachel and Megan  they are two ordinary women or so as it might appear in the first chapters  leading two very different lives  but are they different really  Their characters are written up so beautifully that their misery  pain  emptiness and darkness reverberates from the pages of the book out into your world  You can FEEL the darkness  The misery  The emptiness  During the first half of the book  all I kept thinking is how Rachel looks out the window and imagines other people leading perfect lives but up close  everyone s damaged  lonely  running from their own demons with major skeletons at the back of their closets  Everyone s a mess  And then Anna s narration starts  Her side of the story was what I was the least bit interested in  If anything  it annoyed me  But by the end of the book  everything is turned upside down  When you find out all the truth  the truth is so terrible  So deliciously terrible  You think you know someone  but think again  because you don t  Not in the slightest  It s a book that s difficult to put down  You are on that train with Rachel and there s no way you can get off now   WOW  WOW  WOW  I rarely give a book 5 stars  but I started this book at noon yesterday and it s 9 05 am and I m DONE because I couldn t put it down  This book is a 10x better than  Gone Girl  type read with vague undertones and very strongly developed  albeit completely crazy  characters that gripped me from page 1  Rachel  the actual girl on the train  is a mentally unstable raging alcoholic prone to black outs and rough  hungover mornings who has actually lost her job but puts on a facade of boarding the train each and every morning where she passes by a couple she is completely taken with  Jason and Jess   Unbeknownst to her  Jason and Jess are actually Scott and Megan   he a completely devoted  head over heels husband  she a troubled young sometimes philanderer who is babysitting for Tom and Anna   Tom is Rachel s charming ex husband and Anna is his once mistress turned wife  make sure you pay attention  When something sinister happens to one of the characters  they become irrevocably intertwined as they muddled through a very untraditional  whodunit  type story  HIGHLY recommend for all readers   you will not be able to stop until the very last page  Me salia en todos lados este libro  facebook  twitter  librerias    Estaba dando que hablar y yo me sentia atraido   Habra sido el titulo tan falto de los tipicos betseller que se inclinan con palabras rebuscadas y que no definen nada Bueno  sea lo que sea ya lo lei en menos de 4 dias y me gusto tanto que incluso me vere la proxima pelicula adaptacion que tendra Mi resena en cuanto a la historia son dos cosas  Uno  que es impredecible y dos que si usted que lee esto  y ya ha visto Gone girl  esa de Ben Affleck  y le gusto  lea este libro  Es una Must read del ano  Worth the hype  That s how you write a book  would have liked the characters a little more sympathetic however  and that s how you end a book   This has honestly been one of my favorite books in a while  It is written to keep you guessing and always wonder what lies in people s past to motivate them to such actions  It also reminds us that sometimes our own memories have a way of tricking us  I would highly recommend this book and I ll be watching for this author s next book  The distinct voices of the three narrators in this story are most appealing  Rachel is the insecure one  Meghan is the confused one  And Anna is the distant one  the almost cruel one  They each have their own interpretations of the same events  which when seen from their individual perspectives never jive with the same meaning  This multiple meanings angle is so human  so true to real life Take for example  Anna s admission of feeling no guilt when she manipulated her way into the life of a married man  This is only too believable  though she told her friends she felt guilty  she really didn t  In fact  she got a little thrill out of the idea that the wife might happen by the restaurant and see her and the husband together and instantly know that she had taken him from her  Sick  But wow  what a believable character I very much appreciate the author s understanding of human emotions and her effort to describe them   WOnderful   Edgy  thriller  mystery   Great read    A refreshing thriller with wonderful characters  The protagonist is a mess  but the mess she gets herself into helps her grow and gives her a promising future  Dark  edgy    and I love that it s told by three of the key players  A boring daily ride on the commuter train turns into a nail biting murder and our downtrodden lead character is caught in the middle  Fantastic  one of the best The description and title drew me in and the book never let go of me till the last page  The characters are all imperfect  and identifying with them is difficult  but that just increases their intrigue somehow  By the end of the book  I d become very attached to some of them  The writing is straightforward and clean  and the plot moves along at a good pace  Suspense builds especially towards the end the twist took me totally by surprise  But it made sense when I looked back   yeah  that was kind of suspicious  now I think about it  yes  I can see now how that happened  That sort of thing  It s a well written thriller deserving of its good reviews  I ll be looking for more by this author  Look out Gillian and Tana  there s some competition in town  A wholly psychological thriller with information doled out in such small pieces you d think Hawkins was training dolphins  This book goes deeper into alcoholism and dysfunctional relationships than most thrillers  Told from the viewpoint of three distinct narrators  the twists and turns emerge at a maddeningly slow  yet somehow breakneck pace  Hawkins is on my must read list  Wow  I couldn t put the book down and stayed up last night to finish it  Definitely a must read  The Girl on the train is a brilliant crime novel  The way it is written is catching  although I am nit sure if a drunk woman is really a good main character for the book  But it turned well in this case Story is about the broken woman  drunk unstable  divoreced Rachel  One of the narratives  She is divorced already for two years ans she commutes every day to London by train and watch people  their houses fron the window  She makes up stories about their lives  gives them names  Akso for Jess and Jason perfect couple she used to watch and inagine how great they life is  the same as her was before  She lives now in a rented room with Cathy and she was fired from her PR job  because of coming drunk during lunch  Tom  her ex husband seems to live a pleasant life in the same house they bought together with woman Anna  he was unfaithful to Rachel  One day a woman  Rach used watch from the train  is kissing with an unknown man outside on lawn of their house  That night Rachel tottally drunk goes to see her ex  She does nit remember what happeed to her that night  only that she has a big cut on her head  That night also Megan  Jess  disappeares and is missing for 2 weeks  The main suspects are her husband Scott and her lover  therapist Kamal  The destiny of all three women is entangled and it is interesting to watch how all their perfect lives  except of Rachel s  change  how all the lies are uncovered Great first book for Paula  This book is perfect  thrilling and I can t wait to see it made into a movie soon   Absolutely loved this book  It took a little while to get going  but man once it did it had me hooked  I have discovered that I love books with messed up and complicated characters and this book definitely had a wide variation  The twist I did not see coming and the ending more than satisfying  can t wait to pick up the authors next novel  I think it just rips and moves along with a pretty quick pace  lots of chances for everyone to be a suspect in this pretty awesome summer read  It made me think of Gone Girl  but it stands alone as its own unique creation  the conceit of train rides back and forth  the fading and uncertain narration  the shifting style  I read it in only a few days  and I think it is pretty intense read   This is probably one of the best suspense novels I ve read in a while and I believe it has everything to do with the characters  Everyone was practically a suspect    except the actual culprit The thing is  when you have an array of flawed characters  from anger management problems  control freaks  alcoholics  mild OCD  it s hard to pin down any one person  People don t necessarily have  motive  but    they could have done it  Maybe that s what I found so appealing about the writing style as well  The main protagonists each got a chance to say their story  To validate their actions  And it worked for the plot All in all  I would totally recommend this book if you re looking for a good suspense to read  I ve seen a lot of people compare and contrast this story to that of  Gone Girl  but I have not read that yet to do the same  I personally can t say I hated this book like some people here claim  I hated all the characters at some point or another  that s for sure  But I did love everything else  the writing  the pace  not knowing who to trust and expect a plot twist every chapter  The story is solid  addictive and keeps the reader hooked till the very end  The characters are genuine  as it really seems you re getting a peak of Rachel s  Megan s and Anna s lifes  Those girls could be real persons and like every and each of us the hold at least one secret  And like some of us  they are insecure  lost and confused  They struggle to keep it together and they re too weak to let go of abusive relationships  Their problems are very real  and anyone near you could be struggling with the same  your mom  a friend  a neighbour  The book is also overwhelming  as you get yourself going trhough the stages of hate  distrust  compassion  concern and frustration  I love how nothing about this story is sugar coated and the author suprises us with raw moments of violence and abuse  physical and emotional that are heavier because of the fact that you get so caught up in the story that you forget this is fiction  I didn t love the end though  It ties the loose ends but it just didn t stands up to the rest of the story  Certanly a must read  The problem with reading a story that s promoted as having a lot of twists is that half the time  you spend so much time wondering where the twists are going to come and where they re gong to lead that by the end  you wonder where they were to begin with  see In the Dark  for example  Luckily  Girl on the Train manages to live up to its twisty reputation  It sets you up to believe one thing  then deftly diverts your attention to something else  so that bits of the characters  viewpoints and motivations are revealed a little at the time The pace was excellent  maybe a little slower at the beginning than I would have expected given the hype  but ratcheting up to un put down able by the end  The tension was very high throughout  and the plotting excellent One critique I ve seen in a lot of reviews is that none of the characters are particularly likeable  and this is true  If you have to like or look up to a character to enjoy a book  this probably isn t a good choice for you  If you can enjoy flawed characters  go for it The biggest problem I saw in the writing is that there are three narrators  and they all sound alike  You can t easily tell without checking who is narrating each chapter  But then again  there are a lot of similarities among the three  maybe the lack of different voices is a feature  not a bug  I m not sure All in all  I loved it  and I would recommend it to any fan of thrillers or mysteries  LOVED  LOVED  LOVED  Soo good   Wow     This book kept me on the edge of my seat right till the last sentence  Such a beautiful and dark story  Poignant  yet I could relate to the characters  their pain  hurt and confusion  This is the kind of psychological thriller that I love  This is the kind of book that I wish to write someday  Loved it   This book was very compelling  I liked the alternating perspectives  it helped to keep you guessing  always wanting more information  I could have done without the language  though  As posted on  http   www hollieinwanderlust co uk 2   There s obviously been a lot of hype surrounding this book for quite a while now  and I managed to pick up my copy of it for about a fiver in Tesco a few months back  I put it to one side and it s only recently when EVERYONE and their dog was reading it that I thought I d better get my ass into gear and read it before I find myself reading spoilers  I took a few days to get into it  picking it up and reading a few pages at a time when I had a break in the day  I went to Liverpool this weekend to catch up with some friends  and that involved a train ride and two bus journeys totalling a couple of hours worth of travel  and that was all it took for me to get well and truly hooked on the story  I finished it the same night after a solid reading session and have to say that it s one of the best novels that I ve read in a long time  and it s absolutely remarkable considering that this is Paula Hawkins  debut novel  The story revolves around a woman called Rachel  but you actually get to see another two perspectives  We learn that her current state  a woman suffering severely from alcoholism  blackouts and arguably from depression  is one that developed as the result of a number of devastating events  She loses her job and becomes obsessed with watching a couple from the window of the train on her commute to  work  everyday  She notices something unusual one morning  and from this point onwards she can t help but insert herself into their lives wherever she can  I have to say that I did eventually  around 40 or pages towards the end  guess what was going on but I think that s just because I drive myself mad with theories whenever I can t work something out  it really wasn t obvious and I was still slightly shocked with how everything panned out  I liked Rachel as a character  generally speaking  although I couldn t really connect with her with regards to the alcoholism  I didn t have much sympathy because she was aware of how it was doing her no favours  and I feel that aspect was overplayed a little bit  On the other hand  I absolutely hated the character of Anna  I thought she was a really unnecessarily nasty  vindictive character and I felt sorry for Megan for a number of reasons  least of all because of what happened to her  The writing was mature and full of suspense  and it kept me on the edge of my seat  It actually got to the point where I refused to go to sleep because I couldn t wait to finish the end of it  and that hasn t happened to me for a very long while  I am really getting into the psychological thriller genre recently and this is definitely one of the best I ve read  I wasn t really a fan of Gone Girl  and this has been compared heavily to that  although I really don t think the plots are all that similar really  so if you enjoyed Gone Girl then you ll definitely love this   4 75 out of 5 starsRachel takes the same commuter train every morning  Every day she rattles down the track  flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes  and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck  She s even started to feel like she knows them   Jess and Jason   she calls them  Their life  as she sees it  is perfect  Not unlike the life she recently lost And then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough  Now everything s changed  Unable to keep it to herself  Rachel offers what she knows to the police  and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next  as well as in the lives of everyone involved  Has she done more harm than good I listened to this book on audiobook and truthfully  I looked forward to spending more time in the car just to hear more of the story  At first  I hated the characters  Rachel was sad  pathetic  and had no redeeming qualities  She is obsessed with her ex husband  Tom  who seems reasonable at first and then distasteful  married to an even worse woman  And on and on it goes  No character could have any claims on my favorite  nor could I say I liked any of them  And yet   That is what makes the book so incredible and captivating  Usually it is the characters that drive to finish the story  what will become of such and such    but this book kept me going with solely the plot  Rachel is a completely unreliable narrator  She s drinking constantly and many times she has no recollection of entire events  The twists in this book seemed to hit me in the face out of nowhere and kept me coming back for more  And the ending    The ending was everything I could have ever hoped for from this book  I am terrible at picking out twists and bad guys so I had no idea what was going to happen  I found myself bored with Gone Girl  the main character  This book seemed to do what Gone Girl couldn t   keep me going not because of empathy or connection to the protagonist  but because of the plot and resolution I would recommend this book to any fan of mystery or anyone who thoroughly enjoyed Gone Girl or any book with an unreliable narrator  I would recommend that everyone at least give this book a few chapters try   you ll be hooked  What a book  I was totally engrossed in it and stayed up most of the first night as I couldn t put it down  Finished it the next day  I can t find anything negative to say about it  and wish I could write as well as Paula Hawkins  I wanted to read it as it has been such a huge seller  and I was lucky enough to outsell it last year at Haslemere Bookshop with The Folly Under the Lake  However  now that I ve read it I have no idea how I managed that as Paula s book is amazing  Looking forward to reading more by this author  Paula Hawkins could take over the Ruth Rendell throne as best living English mystery writer  The Girl on the Train actually reminds me more of a work by the late Rendell in her Barbara Vine Persona  The characters are well developed and interesting  I figured out who the murderer was towards the end  but it was still fun to see how the person would be exposed and whether there would be any more victims  Now I want to read The Girl Next Door by Rendell and The Child s Child by Vine so I can compare  Brilliant storytelling  Suspenseful  Full of irony and everything that makes for a good read   This was a very suspenseful read  This book has kept me rivited from the start  It is a fantastic psychological thriller  not my usual genre  and its told in first person narrative by 3 women all of whom are seriously flawed and none of whom you d want as a friend  The narrators of this story are all  unreliable   great word  and the men are no better   So I felt no love for any of the characters  Rachel a self pitying alcoholic  Anna a smug  attractive housewife who is now married to Rachels  ex and Megan a vivacious blonde with a past but  I did feel drawn in by each of them to know their stories and find out why they were who they were  The book is full of clever twists and turns it s suspenseful and it kept me guessing which is how a thriller should be  The book is going to be made into a film but the setting has changed from England to the US which for me is a shame as it feels like a very English book Some have said its  Hitchcockian  and I think they have a point  I don t think I ll see the film when it comes out  I think I d rather leave these people as they are  in my minds eye  A very good read Wow All I can say is this book is fantastic  Anything else might give away too much  Edge of your seat reading  You might want to allot a few uninterrupted hours because you won t want to put it down  With all the hype  I picked up this one and zoomed it to the top of the reading pile  I was not disappointed The unreliable narrator made this story more of a mystery to follow  In fact  none of the characters were trustworthy to me so everyone was suspect and unlikable However  the progressive thriller pacing of the story kept me reading to find out whodunnit  Maybe a 4 5  not life changing  but a brilliant thriller that I read in three hours flat   Reviewed in detail on  Rain and a Book  Confession time  I first picked The Girl On The Train up a few months ago and did not finish it then  because I felt it was moving too slow for my tapaula hawkins girl train sreesha divakaran rain and bookste  Plus  I assumed it was yet another over hyped runaway hits  I remember it was being touted as the next Gone Girl or something  for the record  I haven t read Gone Girl  Big  big mistake  I gotta say  This book is spine chillingly  goosebumps rendering ly brilliant   apologies for the weird adverbs   I should not have abandoned it the first time The Girl On The Train is the story of Rachel Watson  who  after going through a bitter divorce  sinks into deep depression and alcoholism  She is fired from her job  but she cannot bring herself to admit this to Cathy  her roommate  So she takes a train to London every morning  pretending to go to work and returns every evening  From the train  she can see her old house  the one she shared with her husband Tom Watson  where he now lives with his new wife  Anna  and their daughter Evie  A few doors down is another house   of a young couple  who look very much in love to Rachel  She observes them every day  names them Jess and Jason  Their real names are Megan and Scott Hipwell  One day  Megan goes missing  and Rachel gets embroiled in the mystery  because she is convinced she knows something about the disappearance  but she cannot piece it together because of memory loss caused by her drinking habit Read the rest of the review   here   Awesome story It keeps you guessing the whole way  I couldn t put it down  Similar to Gonna Girl  but with a much better twist  Great mystery and page turner  Critics are raving about The Girl on the Train  and after three days of white knuckle reading and hastily digested chapters on my lunch break  they are right to be  Author Paula Hawkins throws an alcoholic  makes all bad decisions  divorcee protagonist straight into a train station  where  on that very same night  a woman ends up murdered  Haphazard tendrils and alcoholic recollections connect Rachel to the murder victim in ways that aren t clear to anyone  not even Rachel herself Breathless is the best word I can use to describe my physical state upon completing the book  uncertain is the best word I can use to describe my emotional one  The book is written from three points of view  all of which are women s  There is our main character  Rachel  in addition to the murder victim  Megan  and Rachel s ex husband s new wife  and former mistress  Anna  In addition  Rachel has frequent conversations with her roommate Cathy  and a few run ins with a woman investigator working on the murder case I hated Rachel for 99  of this book  Rachel s character is a case study in unreliable narration  and I bow down to Paula Hawkins  skills as a writer for executing it so well  I never trusted Rachel s instincts  or her decision making  and I certainly never trusted her memory  All these things make for a frustrating read as we try to pick apart the truth from Rachel s observations  and unravel the mystery of Megan s death At points  I was rooting for Rachel to let it go  She doesn t need any more drama in her life  I thought  perfectly content to let this murder mystery end with Rachel attending AA meetings and mending fences with her former employer  But Hawkins doesn t give us the satisfaction of seeing Rachel clean up her life  Instead she drags us maddeningly down the rabbit hole that Rachel is determined to travel  and we are forced to grit our teeth and have our minds chew on red herring after red herring I assumed often that Rachel was reading her own emotional state into the murder of a woman she had never even met  All emotions Rachel had toward Megan originated from a fantasy reality she had conjured up during her daily commute past Megan s house  and envying the seemingly perfect life she lived  In this fantasy world  Megan was  Jess  and her spouse  Scott  was  Jason   Even after learning the couple s real names  Rachel slipped back into referring to them as Jess and Jason on multiple occasions I looked down on Rachel  I had little sympathy for her  Yes her husband left her for another woman  but come on  You have to move on eventually  Instead of pity  I often felt disgust  which is exactly how many of the people Rachel interacted with treated her Rachel is clearly suffering emotionally on a very deep level  and trying to self medicate with alcohol  She doesn t feel she deserves anything from anyone  and she tries to make herself feel  more bad  because she doesn t think she feels bad enough for all the things she s done during her drunken black outs  I allowed her own evaluation of herself to validate my own negative opinions of her Why didn t I feel more pity toward Rachel  Why didn t I trust her more  These are the questions I had to ask at the end of the book  So often women are not trusted to recall events correctly  and have their judgement questioned to the point they no longer trust themselves either  I realized I had fallen into that same line of thinking  I listened to other people s opinions of Rachel  even though I was perceiving most of this through her point of view The author makes readers look within themselves and challenge their perceptions of alcoholism and emotional abuse  It reveals the multiple layers of judgement and criticism that victims  disproportionately women  have to dig out from For all these reasons  and more  The Girl on the Train gets 5 stars from me Stayed up way too late reading this book  Couldn t put it down  Gripping from start to finish   Fantastic Could not put down  Very thrilling and unpredictable unlike most thrillers  Great pacing and writing  Looking forward to Paula Hawkins next novel   Wow  Wishing Alfred Hitchcock was here today    Boy would he have a field day with this one  I could not put this book down and few books grab me like this one did    better than Gone Girl  Great psychological thriller  Um enredo muito bem construido  Quando comecamos a le lo  e muito dificil parar e quando acabamos  ficamos com pena que nao continue     With secrets  betrayals and three unreliable  and unlikeable  narrators  The Girl on the Train is a psychological thriller that s being compared to Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl  This intriguing story is set in London where the chronically drunk Rachel spends a daily commute obsessing over her ex husband and imagining a perfect life   not for herself but for a younger couple that lives in her former neighborhood  Like Gone Girl Rachel s narrative and that of her romantic rival just don t add up  Throw in the perspective of the new young woman on the block and things really get interesting  especially when one of the narrators goes missing   Excellent  I read it in a day  Big surprises are ahead if you read the book  Probably it is more my mistake as I did not know that the book is a psychological thriller but it is just about a female weirdo  The book picks up steam half way  clues about past and present lives of the main characters are left at the most unexpected places  Of course  somebody has to die  probably one of the most charming characters  The question  whodunnit  remains open until the very end  A little masterpiece in a world with just caring  loving women  I read this in one sitting  I was intrigued and anxious to get the full story  I rarely read secular novels like this as I prefer to read stories that embody healthy marriages and lives  I think our society offers us plenty of unhealthy behaviors and relationships leaving us no need to seek it out in the form of entertainment  I am glad I read this story  though  As a rare treat  I was kept in suspense  anxiously reading  Did the audiobook  Started slow  but holy moly did it finish with a bang   Storyline is interesting and the characters well written  Not exactly an HEA  but a stand alone that is worth the read    THE GIRL ON THE TRAINSorry folks  this is not like the story of Assia Wevill and Ted Hughes where she gasses herself in the oven out of insane jealousy  It is the story of an abused  lonely and pathetic drunk British woman who fantasizes about what she sees   who she sees   in passing apartment windows from her seat on a daily train commute to London  Something she thinks she sees changes her life for ever  Trust me  this is a must read psychological thriller  It moves quickly out of a slightly slow opening chapter or two into a suspenseful who done it murder mystery of the highest caliber  It had me completely riveted and waiting for the shoe to drop until the very end  This is a page turner that makes Rear Window seem like a kiddies bedtime story in comparison  Woah  Hitchcockian  Hells yeah  This is also the sad story of black out binge drinking and the trail of hell it leaves for friends and family in its wake  That part of this novel will be hard for those affected by alcohol abuse to take in  But it turns out to be a crucial element  I e  the story is driven forward as Rachel gradually  desperately tries to recall blacked out bits of memory that could solve who may have done the murder  It was shocking and very suspenseful to the end and I could not have predicted the outcome  It had me thinking ah      well of course   I should have known it was ____ all along   The story unfolded in such a way that with each bit of new information offered up  a new suspect came into question and it is masterfully woven together using first person diary like entries as told by the various players in a crafty timeline  I would say  however  that although brilliant in form  none of the male characters have their own chapters diaries  This is written by a woman for women in defense of a couple of troubled women I think which is great   I get that  I just want to know why  for example that Scott or Tom or even Kamal or Mac don t get their chance to roll out their own yarn  to come clean in their own words  Was it intentional by Hawkins  Would this have divulged too much and let on who done it  Are all the men bad guys abusers in this  Are there no good guys   Maybe take it up at your book club In the end I hardly expected that the nearly suicidal  clinically depressed  insecure  multi personality like tramp of an alcoholic could go from being the culprit in my mind to being  well  the hero AND a completely turned around sober human being at that   The police think she s a rubbernecker  a stalker  a nutcase and mentally unstable and they are right  But she is transformed as a victim of circumstance from abused drunk and incredible witness to hero sleuth after being jolted into sobriety  It s a stretch but I guess her recovery is almost believable in the way it unfolds  I loved this book  Five stars  It is a must read  Paula Hawkins has a masterpiece on her hands  Mini spoiler  Hey  Rachel did actually see Kamal on the porch kissing Megan   Jess   I adored this book  way more than I enjoyed gone girl  Paula Hawkins writing is steady but fast  it s thrilling and so intriguing  you are bound to flip to the next page in a mind racing attempt  You will honestly love  the girl on the train    Excellent  Suspenseful  Multiple narrators  I really liked this book  Loved this book all the way through to the end      A brilliantly written who dunnit debut by Paula Hawkins  This book was compulsively readable and fit snuggly in the  guilty pleasure  category I indulge in every once in a while  I picked the plot twist about three pages before it occurred  so I d say that the mystery held thick throughout the first three quarters of the novel  Hawkins has a gritty form of crime writing that is reminiscent of Gillian Flynn  Her characters are distantly relatable in a  I know how the protag feels  but god I could never be that much of a hot mess  kind of a way  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick and easy crime thriller  especially for those who loved Gone Girl   This is a great read  and also a great testament for minding your own business  If you want a great end of the school year read   this is it  Absolutely amazing  Do yourself a favor and read this book  Read 100 pages in a sitting in the middle of the night and get scared to get up to go to the bathroom  Because this book is amazing  will truly make you think and feel everything Hawkins wants you to feel  It ll keep you guessing and doubting every character until the very end   Just finished reading the book and I have to admit that I learned a lot from the characters  regardless of how horrid and miserable they were throughout the entire book  If you contemplated the events from a positive angle  you d feel a bit of insight learning about all the things you should NEVER do when you re an adult  The ending was somewhat flat and left me disappointed  which explains what I gave the book four starts instead of five   Completely blew me away   superb psychological thriller  Where do I begin to share my thoughts on this one      when it made such a huge impact on me  It s the story of Rachel  the girl on the train  who commutes daily  the train journey itself becoming a huge focal point of her days  She watches the same houses as she passes by and recognises certain people so well she feels she knows them   she is the ultimate people watcher and concocts little stories about their lives until one day she witnesses something disconcerting and worrying and feels she must do something   but what  A young woman is missing and because of her observations from the train  Rachel thinks she may be able to throw a little light on what has happened to her  She is used to being disbelieved so is at first reluctant to get involved  As she gets drawn more deeply into the lives of others we realise her own life isn t quite as it at first appears and secrets begin to emerge which threw me time and time again  I had huge sympathy for her situation despite her often being her own worst enemy  This story is so tightly woven it wraps itself around you like suffocating in kid leather  Impeccably constructed and penned with breathtaking intensity A police investigation is going on around the missing girl and Rachel tries to do her own investigation  but is thwarted time and again and we begin to wonder if she knows more than she is letting on about what happened or maybe she is barking up completely the wrong tree The story is told in the different voices of 3 women  all a similar age and in similar circumstances yet all very different  and all with hidden flaws  and this technique works incredibly wellUnreliable narrators have become De Rigeur since Gone Girl set the bar and  like gone girl  this work contains several different viewpoints and we don t really know who can be trusted or even who to believe  It sucked me in from the first few words and kept me in a state of nail biting tension throughout Its a refreshing relief for the women in the story to have such dark and yet very recognisable faults and vices  it makes them so immensely human yet kept me wary and alert all through the book To say much more would be tantamount to spoilers and I don t want to spoil the pleasure anyone is going to get from reading this   if you like tangled tales  unreliable narrators  apprehension and tension in your stories look no further  The Girl on the train is waiting to blow your mind   go for it  The hype on this novel is so white hot  meeting my expectations was next to impossible  though I did try to set them at a reasonable level  I was completely prepared to be underwhelmed with some schmaltzy melodrama  Well  I am pleased and awed to tell you that I was wrong in all the best ways  that The Girl on the Train was powerful  tense  and moving  It involves real people with real voices  messed up  fragile  compromised lives  I will tell you right up front that I experienced this story on audiobook and that the production was absolutely wonderful   three excellent actresses doing stellar work in bringing this world into reader s ears and imaginations  I was particularly impressed with the narrator who read for Megan  and I wish I could mention to you her name to commend her performance  but I m not certain which of the women it is  They re all great  regardless Keep your eye on Paula Hawkins because she is absolutely the real deal  it is so astounding to realize that this quality endeavor is her first novel  We are in for so many fantastic reading experiences in our future from this writer   A thriller to be read and devoured  The writing is interesting and captivating  There is a bit of similarity to  REAR WINDOW   Our imaginations are powerful  Page after page  chapter after chapter we learn the strengths and weaknesses of the characters  We determine the killer  we change our mind about the killer  Who is real  who is imaginary  what are the characters motives  So much to lose  Who do you trust  What is REAL  what has been fabricated If you love a good thriller  grab this one and it will grab you  Compelling read  I m a fan of tales that weave back and forth in time and between characters  A psychological thriller that kept me guessing long enough to want to read to the end  Yup  Read it  Loved it  Recommend it  Great twists  Kept me up at night forcing me to read one more paragraph  And it kept me up thinking about what just happened or how could so and so be so stupid   etc  This book not only entertained me  but also made me feel the story  Wonderfully written and crafted   4 5 stars Page Turner  I do a twelve hour drive fairly regularly  and I ve learned listening to a thriller can be one of the best ways to help the time pass   Five hours into the nonfiction can make me pretty sleepy   I had this one on my  to listen  list as an audio book  but when I saw it in the local library  I picked it up and read the opening pages  That led to taking it home  and couple of days later I was done  I haven t read a book this fast in many years This book alters perspectives telling the story from the viewpoint of three women characters  Sometimes I see this as a  trick  of sorts for a writer who doesn t have enough material to make a novel go  This story wasn t like that  The structure is interesting and organic to the story  In fact  if I had been writing this book  I d have been worried how so many of the pages come from one of the three characters  perspective  It was bold and it worked well  So I have a pet peeve against the alternating perspectives but liked this The book is also about alcoholism and depression and women who are left home all day to take care of their kids  This book is a rich and interesting look at those themes  It s a book where you know from the start that one of the keys to a happy read will be a surprise to the question of   Who done it   Hawkins does a great job of  at least for me  keeping me off balance until the last pages  I recommend   Totally grippingOutstanding psychological novel  The author takes you on a wild journey through the eyes of the three women in the story  Not until near the end does the terrible truth begin to reveal itself  On the way there  you are buffeted by the stories of the protagonists  live their anguish and their hopes  move with them through the landscape of the tale  I haven t been so engrossed in a novel for some time  One of those books you can t wait to finish to find out what happens but then feel devastated that it s over  A masterpiece  The girl  Rachel  a raging alcoholic  rides the train everyday to hide the fact she lost her job from her roommate  She gets particularly enamored with a couple she sees each day and makes up stories in her head  She also can t seem to stay out of her ex husbands new life and wife  One day she witnesses a tragedy and believes she can help the police  And she can t stay away In the beginning and actually through most of it I had a hard time keeping all the characters straight  even though Rachel  Megan and Anna had there own chapters  I really had to pay attention to the date at each chapter and who s it was  That being said  this was an absolute page turner for me  Very well plotted and mixed between reality and not reality  I did not like the mc  so it surprises me I gave it such a high rating  but I just couldn t stop reading this  to find out the truth and maybe some redemption  Very good book  The book was perfect written  I loved it  The whole book was very exciting   Kitabin karakterleri kendilerini sorunlarinda kaybetmis  yalanci  sadakatsiz ve bencil insanlar  Kadinlar gucsuz  depresyonlarinda dibe vurmuslar  Yani gunumuz burjuva bunalimlarini ve acimasizliklarini tamamiyle anlatmayi basarmis yazar Tabi sonunda kadin karakterin neden bu kadar kafayi yemis oldugunu anliyoruz ve kendi gucunu geri kazaniyor  Olaylar muthis bir kurguyla anlatilmis ve hem hepsine acidim hem sinirlendim hem de sempati duydum  Karisik duygulara surukledi bu kitap beni ve sanirim iyi kitaplarin yapmasi gereken sey de bu  I very much liked this book  I don t often give 5 stars  But this book had me hooked almost from the very beginning  I could understand Rachel s POV   the infertility  the severe depression  the alcohol addiction  the getting involved in something almost to just feel normal again  I think she was written this way to be despicable and pitied   but I completely got her  The plot was kept you guessing until the end and I like that too  I figured out the ending just about the same time that the protagonist did  Very well written  I can see why it is compared to Gone Girl  but I think the two are very different from each other  I would recommend this book to those who can understand a character such as what I mentioned above  I believe if you find that kind of habit disgusting or intolerable  then the book won t appeal to you  Also beware that Rachel takes you on her journey of being depressed  so if you are an emotional reader like I am  it s easy to feel the same things for yourself  Don t do it  lol  Could not put this book down  All done  The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a stand alone novel of mystery intrigue and thriller variety  Hawkins builds a world that is almost like putting together a jigsaw puzzle or wading through a dense fog  The characters that populate the world both drive the narrative and pop off the page  This book feels like the events that happen in it could happen under anybody s nose  Hawkins reveals her true story thread deliberately slowly almost like peeling an onion  I m being intentionally vague on the narrative because this book is best discovered while your going through the book  I will say this you won t see the ending coming  Hawkins masterfully hides the ending well  The hype train is big with this book  but I have to say it s one of the corner stone works of our time  The Girl on the Train is a must read five star read  Rachel is living a lie  Every day she leaves her friend s home where she has been staying  until she can get back on her feet  and takes the train into London  Ostensibly she is going to work  but she lost her job weeks ago and now when she gets to London she goes to the library or the park  and buys canned gin and tonics and drinks those until it is time to go home  Sometimes she drinks so much that she loses blocks of time that she cannot account for  a fact that scares her but not enough to stop the drinking  Her friend knows she drinks  Rachel cannot hide the slurred speech or the smell  but her friend doesn t know about the blackouts or that Rachel lost her job because of the drinking  Rachel keeps meaning to tell her  but her friend s reaction the disgust  the impatience  keeps Rachel from saying the words  So every morning  Rachel gets up and gets dressed and takes the train to London and every day on the train she passes the house where this young couple live  She has named them Jess and James and they are all that she is not  young  happy  married and living together in a cute house  They are living the life that Rachel should have had but does not  and every day Rachel fantasizes about their life  projecting all her longings and lost dreams on them and in some strange way it soothes her pain Then one day from the window of the train she sees Jess kissing another man and soon after that she finds out that Jess has disappeared and the police are now looking for her Megan  the one Rachel calls Jess  is not living the dream life that Rachel imagines  Although she loves her husband  sometimes she wonders if this is enough  She has also lost her job  but doesn t know what she wants to do  In the meantime she decides that maybe she could babysit for the couple down the street who have a new baby  giving herself some time to sort things out and talk it over with her therapist Anna is married to Tom  Rachel s ex husband  They live in the home that Tom and Rachel lived in when they were married and Anna is now busy making it her own  Their new baby is a symbol of all that went wrong between Rachel and Tom  When Rachel found out that she could not have children their marriage deteriorated and Rachel s drinking escalated  Rachel still makes drunk calls to Tom which Anna resents enormously and sometimes shows up at the house which terrifies Anna  Although she loves the baby  she is surprised by how much energy and time it takes  so she is relieved to find that Megan  who lives just up the street  is willing to babysit so Anna can have a break Hawkins is a deft story teller  Although Rachel is an  unreliable narrator   there is something likable about Rachel and you want to know her story and she makes you understand her pain  As Hawkins shifts from character to character we see what led up to Megan s disappearance and the interconnections between our characters  lives  As the story progresses and Rachel s blackouts play a bigger and bigger role in what happened  the tension rises and each revelation brings you closer to knowing what happened to Megan Although compared to Gone Girl  I found this book much more satisfying  It is wonderfully written  with characters that are realistic and relatable  Hawkins explores the depths of a woman s despair  the consequences of trusting too much and you come away with the realization that you never really know what goes on in a marriage or behind closed doors  I LOVED this book  It had an such an interesting perspective on all kinds of personality disorders  and it kept me until the very end on what actually happened   I couldn t put this book down  Unpredictable  thrilling  and so well written it read like a movie playing in my head  I couldn t wait to get to the end to find out what happened   one of the best books i ve ever read  hands down  from start to finish  it kept me interested  i thought i knew how it was going to end about four different times and it kept shocking me over and over  the main character annoyed me just a tiny bit but nothing major  seriously  if you liked gone girl  you will devour this book  Great book  Loved the suspense and story   I have lost control over everything  even the places in my head   A fascinating book as good as its reputation says it is  The dream like trance the alcoholic protagonist was in led me to feel the surreal experience fully  As she rode the train and fantasized about the imagined lives of the neighbors  while passing by the house of her ex who she obsessed over and wouldn t psychologically let go of  she fully took me along for the ride in a creative way  I was sucked into her head  even if she repulsed me with her weakness  as she went back and forth from present day to past tense  trying to reclaims memories that would help solve a mystery The multiple point of book also digs into a few other heads too  the wife she sees through the window and imagines a life for  and the  other woman  that stole her husband from her years before  Their stories merge together While the story is strong with keeping me glued as to what s going to happen next  it was a detailed character study more than anything  The protagonist is so weak sometimes she does nauseate  but overall was likeable  Out of all the characters  I disliked Anne the most   ugh  Most of these people were flawed paper people with few redeeming qualities  but it had a realism in the intensity An unusual  well done experience  The very end isn t a shocker  but it was a good twist wrap up  There are surprises in store for the reader  twists in the almost Hitchcock type tale  everyday lives made extraordinary when brushed with crime  It works better since the characters aren t completely likeable  because their realistic flaws make the plot believable  It helps the story is told in patches by characters who aren t always reliable because of addiction  memory lapses  lies  false motives  and coming from different areas of the playing field  When did you become so weak   I don t know  I don t know where that strength went  I don t remember losing it  I think that over time it got chipped away  bit by bit  by life  by the living of it   If you take away the mystery  the crime and tension  you get a sad drama that tugs on the heart strings and makes the reader emphasize with the characters who dig their own graves  Is it harder to feel sympathy for someone who makes their own mess and keeps sabotaging themselves  In this book  not really  I kept sympathizing while being repulsed as the longer I read about the character  the more I understood the trance like weaknesses This is a book I d recommend for any reader  Whether you re into drama  horror  suspense  mystery  most of that s here  The train itself almost takes on its own personality  you get that strong of a feel for the environment these characters are in  The writer is talented and dishes all this out slowly under a druggish haze that heightens the experience  Completely recommended   I don t generally read thrillers  but on the encouragement of Stephen King  I did  gladly  It starts pretty depressingly and if u give it a chance u will be handsomely rewarded     The most fucked up  captivating and irritating book I have read this year  It took me a while to read because I ve been busy revising and whatever but wow  it lures you in and you can t let go of it  even if you try   It s so thrilling and exciting  you read from all these points of view and you re trying to figure out who s bad and good  It s well written and causes such suspense  by the end of it you realise you re at the edge of your seat  Will leave you shocked and end up giving you goosebumps  Lesson learnt from this book  don t trust anybody  ha  You won t see it coming  Reader beware  Once you start turning the pages of this mystery  you will be hooked  You will neglect other aspects of your life to keep reading  You will require post reading discussion  so maybe read this book with a friend or book club The summary of this book introduces the reader to Rachel  a train commuter  who has been watching the same husband and wife on their deck from the train window for months  After she sees something shocking  Rachel tells the police and sets into motion events where she has potentially done more harm than good The summary compares this store to a Hitchcockian thriller  And there is most definitely a Rear Window aspect to this plot driven mystery  The narrators are all unreliable in one aspect or another  so figuring out what has really occurred is quite fun One detail that becomes apparent within the opening chapter is that Rachel has a drinking problem  Her imagination appears overly stimulated  She s escaping into other people s lives because hers is such a mess  However  Rachel is still likable  Aspects of her life are relatable  She thinks things like   The sense of shame I feel about an incident is proportionate not just to the gravity of the situation  but also to the number of people who witnessed it  She knows she has reached a new low  She s not exactly sure how she got here or how to get out of her rut  Even though her life is beyond mundane  I never tired of her narration  Much of the plot hinges on Rachel s perception  Her perception of herself and her perception of the people around her  All of this perception has been influenced by alcohol and her overactive imagination While Rachel is the main character  if you pick up the book and look over the table of contents  you will see the chapters are broken up into the names of three women  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  The other two women are important to the plot  but their narration doesn t get as many pages as Rachel s does Having the narration split up amongst these three characters quickly moves the plot along  Unlike other books that change up narrative perspective  I wanted to hear from each woman  Every time  I never dreaded a chapter change because the narration was going to rotate  Instead  each woman reveals details that kept my attention and kept me wondering about what the heck was going on in this seemingly sleepy suburban neighborhood Around the half way point of this book  I realized that I was going to have to commit to finishing the story  So many people have compared this novel to Gone Girl that I knew the unstoppable reading point would surface And it did  around the last fifth of the book  Would I compare this story to Gone Girl Not exactly  Gone Girl was darker  Much darker  Plus Gone Girl felt more personal because that story centered around the relationship of one husband and wife  The Girl on the Train has more characters from different families interacting  so while it has aspects of the psychological thriller where I kept wondering who did what and why  it wasn t nearly as disturbing as Gone Girl The Girl on the Train explores how closely neighbors  friends  couples  lovers  husbands  and wives know each other  but at the resolution of The Girl on the Train  the plot strands are nicely tied together  The character who emerges as the antagonist remains a bit of a mystery  as that character should  The rest of the characters move on  and as a reader  I m not concerned about them at all  They ll all be fine  I walked away from Gone Girl wondering how those characters would continue to exist  Gone Girl is a reading experience that takes the term psychological thriller to new heights of creepiness  While The Girl on the Train isn t nearly as disturbing or creepy  it s still a solid mystery  well worth a read  Like Gone Girl in the way that it explores one of the creepiest marriages on earth    Think Gone Girl meets Penn Station  Have you ever wondered about the lives of the other commuters  Yeah some of the time you re thinking the story line is crazy or that wouldn t happen in real life  Then you realize you re in the heads of three crazy unpredictable psychopaths and all of a sudden you re into it  Very suspenseful and hard to put down  partially because it s so hard to predict the next step of a jealous alcoholic  Also  great ending  Everyone loves a little justice  Wow  This book made my heart race  had me gasping out loud from shock  my husband kept asking me what s wrong   and gritting my teeth in anticipation  I have Reese Witherspoon to thank for this   she recommended the book on her Instagram account just when I was looking for a new fictional read  Now I am recommending this book to all I know   please read it now  I swear it will get you back into reading if you ve fallen off the reading wagon   I want someone I know to read it so I can discuss my shock and horror with them  because it has the type of plot twists you want someone else to share with you  This book is being compared to Gone Girl  which I also read and liked  but I have to say I prefer The Girl on the Train to Gone Girl  The Girl on the Train felt a little more real to me and moved at a more rapid pace Paula Hawkins  can you please write something else  I ll read anything with your name on it now  Had you on your toes to the very end   Spooky  Brings new meaning to trainspotting    A riveting page turner with a  I didn t see THAT coming  ending  One of the most fast paced thrillers I have read  I can t begin to describe how good the book is  It s one of the books where I don t fall in love with any character  And yet  I am unbiased in liking all the characters  I feel warmth  sympathy and excitement as I read each persons part  I can t predict what happens next  and that leaves me flipping pages at a very fast rate  The language is ordinary  but the emotions aren t  This book takes you deep into the psychology of 2 women and it is gripping in the strictest sense  Thank you Paula Hawkins   Psycho thriller murder mystery  Domestic  Like last year s popular Gone Girl  this is a delicious slice of coupling on the edge of sanity  A wonderful  absorbing read  Loved the way Ms  Hawkins drew me into the minds of her people first  revealed their disturbing story slower  like a tease  Ala voyeurs  we watch Rachel ride the train and fake a life and fall off the wagon  to wake up in the gutter  She is not a protagonist easily loved  she is a heartsick voyeur addicted to booze and old secrets  But is her mind or the vodka playing tricks  Could she have blacked out and     done that  It s hard to tell     Well I read that one fast  for me at least  My favorite books are not usually heavily plot driven  but more reliant on character development  The Girl on the Train shined in both categories  The story moved like a train  slowly at first and picking up the pace until it shot out at lightning speed  I do have to say that none of the characters were particularly likable but the main ones  Rachel and Megan  were fascinating  Quite honestly  Rachel was a train wreck  Having been in substance recovery for many years myself  it was often excruciating to experience her drunkenness so intimately  Fortunately I was a different sort of drunk  So she says  Once I got through the very beginning  there was never a dull moment  and I was surprised by the ending  Great read   One of those rare page turners that you can t stop thinking about  Well written and well characterized and just  Gone Girl  ish enough  I loved this book  I could not put it down  I loved the main character because she was the anti heroine heroine  You realize that her all togetherness is hidden until a situation arises  a crime  that compels her to dig deep down and be the person she truly is      One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl   Three for a girl  I m stuck on three  I just can t get further  My head is thick with sounds  my mouth thick with blood  I really enjoyed this book  despite reading some of the negative reviews  I did find Rachel a bit annoying at times  but I loved the characters and their stories  The author did a great job at making these characters believable  I loved that this book was able to keep me on my toes and keep me guessing  We watch stories on the news  and we want to know more about what the reporters tell us  more than even the authorities know more often than not  but I doubt we could ever imagine ourselves being linked to the tragedy  This novel is a story of what happens when you do happen to be linked to one such event  We start off with Rachel  someone who takes the same train day in and day out watches this couple that live a couple doors down from her old house   which her husband and new wife live in  and she imagines this life for them she wish she had  until one day she sees something out of the ordinary  It jumps around a timeline to give you the full scope of the events  and you get to see different points of view from the three women at the heart of it The Girl on the Train is an intense novel that doesn t ever give  I was completely enthralled all the way through this and barely wanted to stop  The prose is very accessible and the subject matter is one that can be relatable as someone who has ever been fascinated by a particular news story  a person they saw from the distance that one time  or as someone who knows what rock bottom feels like   I don t think I ve ever read a book this fast  Just over 24 hours in total   Probably about 6 hours of actual reading   I think this was better than Gone Girl  The characters were certainly more likable   This story kept me guessing all the way to the end  Incredibly thrilling  This is great fun and a fast read and I thoroughly enjoyed  I suspected the killer s identity fairly early on  and was sure of it well before the Reveal  but still enjoyed the journey getting there  Definitely fun stuff  I wasn t a big fan of the ending because it got a bit hokey and almost every character was acting way out of character compared to how they would act earlier  I understand that the whole plot is built on lies and deceptions  but fairly mundane characters become mustache twirling villains and emotionally dependent liars become the most reliable and levelheaded But the silly ending can be forgiven because it s quite a ride to reach that point  While there aren t many suspects in the story  the author does a good job keeping the reader guessing and surprised  New clues are revealed and loose ends are tied up very well  The narrators are interesting and the lies they deal with and tell themselves isn t frustrating  but believable There s a bit to process  but I don t come away confused or disappointed  It s not quite a classic and I can t see myself rereading it now that I know the twists  but that may change over time since you do find yourself flipping back to earlier segments to piece things together  It s worthy of the praise it s been getting  but I can see how it s not for everyone  This book really kept you guessing   This was one I couldn t put down and read in two days    what a group of characters  what a situation  what a book    back cover comment   I usually am not drawn to this type of book   a suspense thriller  but read it because it was on the best seller list and a friend highly recommended it  I would suggest watching the time element at the beginning of the chapters because they are not in sequence  This caught me off guard and I was confused for a while  The storyline is heart wrenching  full of much emotion and very raw  I loved it   Utterly brilliant  I loved The Girl on the Train and the flawed characters within  Not knowing what to expect I was hooked by the premise of a woman on a commuter train seeing something peculiar at one of the houses she passes every day  The story packs a bigger punch once the reader learns more about our commuter  her ex husband and his new wife  and the couple she nicknames  Jess  and  Jason   because she feels she knows them and their perfect lives given the daily glimpses she enjoys   Things are not as they seem and the tension grows as we learn more There is nothing to criticize in this rich debut by Ms  Hawkins  The story is taunt  believable  though a stretch at times  and gripping  The characters are troubled  each living with mistakes from the past  and making bad choices that impact others  A truly enjoyable escape read and I couldn t wait to see how it would wrap up  I was not disappointed  This is an exciting read  5 starsDisclaimer  This book is NOT a romance  This is a psychological thriller and it s best if you go in totally blind  Trust me on that one  I knew practically nothing about this book when I started  other than it was literally about a girl on a train  duh   that gets a little too involved in watching the people living in a house she passes by every morning and evening on her commute  I was blown away by this book  Maybe it was just the right timing  maybe it was just that the book itself was pretty suspenseful  I don t know  but for me  it worked  I d been in a major book funk  Nothing in the romance genre seemed to hold my interest  I d DNFd 2 books and barely gotten through another  overly hyped  one and I just did not know what do do with myself  It was through desperation that I finally opened this one  and I m glad I did because it totally pulled me in from the first page I honestly can t say much more  for fear of spoiling this  It s one of those books that you need to experience chapter to chapter as the layers slowly get lifted and the mystery revealed  It s a super easy read  written in short chapters that are completely easy to follow despite the number of different characters  The heroine  Rachel was totally relatable  despite being so deeply flawed  Even though I could guess the  big reveal  by 80   I think that was intentionally done by the author  so we could get the full effect of the comeuppance the  villain  had coming  I can totally understand the hype surrounding this book  although I don t know how it compares to Gone Girl as I haven t read that one  or watched the movie   But if you want something different  outside the romance genre  something like a palate cleanser if you will  then this is an excellent option  I honestly couldn t put it down  and kept wondering what was real and what was imagined  It made me think about the way we view people  Who hasn t wondered about perfect strangers in the street  or on the subway or bus  thinking that they have a perfect life  and yet no one knows the dark  deepest secrets we keep  sometimes not even the people closest to us 5 awesome stars and totally recommend you read absolutely NO spoilers if you plan on tackling this one     I really enjoyed this literary murder mystery  I m so glad that I jumped on the band wagon and ordered it from my public library  then waited  4 months until my turn came up for a digital copy In this story  Rachel rides the train to work and back every day on the same route  At the beginning of the book  Rachel is an emotional wreck who has recently been divorced and replaced in her marriage and in her marital home  She spends her commute drinking and creating fantasy narratives about people that she sees along the train route every day  including a young couple who have recently moved in a few doors down from her old home where her husband still lives with his new wife and baby  One day the wife of the young couple goes missing under suspicious circumstances and Rachel finds herself inextricably tied up in the story and in the lives of the people involved  Due to her mental state at the time  she makes one bad decision after another  becoming more and more deeply involved in the situation  despite her lack of a direct connection to the case  The mystery unfolds and is very clever and dramatic This would definitely make a good movie  which I m sure it will be soon  Compared with Gone Girl  I would say that this one was definitely a simpler story and I think I actually enjoyed Girl on the Train more  There was less suspension of disbelief necessary and it wasn t outright scary for the most part  Despite the simplicity of the story  the literary technique of the unreliable narrator kept me guessing because I couldn t see the whole story from a bird s eye view until the narrator herself began to see things more clearly  Very well done  I ve been up until midnight the last two nights finishing this book  Once I got past the halfway point  I couldn t put it down  I loved the character build up  and the plot kept me guessing and made me feel like anything was possible  In the end  the surprises kept coming until almost the last page  There were about 5 different times throughout the book that I was convinced I d figured it all out  only to be thrown another curve again and again  Highly recommend this book  unless you enjoy getting to sleep at a decent hour   in that case  save this one for vacation or a weekend   Great read   READ THIS BOOK  You will not be able to put it down  It will keep you guessing on the edge of your seat all the way to the end  I have no doubt that  The Girl on the Train  will be adapted into a major motion picture  If you are a fan of  Gone Girl  this is the book for you  I wish I could give it more stars   Seriously compelling  ridiculously addicting  and so very fucked up The Girl on the Train was one of the most fun books I ve ever read  I know  fun isn t the first word you d associate with a book like this  but I was lit with excitement by the time I got off this crazy ride This book featured one of the most fascinating characters I ve ever read  Rachel is fascinating like watching a building collapse is fascinating  I don t think I ve ever cringed or screamed more at a character  I ll give you some details about the events in this book  though not too much  but seeing as this is a mystery  I think the details should remain such Rachel is a sad  sloppy shell of a woman who spends most of her life watching the lives of those around her  She used to be different  but now her days roll by without anything to mark them  Until she sees something she shouldn t and becomes involved in the lives of the people she used to watch from afar  I loved Rachel  I felt for her  I was scared for her  I pitied her  and I rooted for her  even though sometimes I wanted to turn my back on her  But I could never leave her alone  She was that friend who exasperated me as she did stupid shit over and over again  but I stuck by her because I knew that she could be better The novel is told mainly from her POV  along with two other women  and through their eyes the reader sees each clue to the puzzle  I loved the format for this book  Its nonlinear plot confused me and spun me in all directions until I had no idea what one was north  The mystery was truly absorbing  made even more so by the fact that the main character s observations were unreliable  I had so much fun trying to see through the mucky facts  but that wasn t even the best part of the book to me I loved the characters most  They were so engaging and well developed  each one evoking strong feelings from me  There wasn t a redundant one in the bunch  This wasn t suspense that relied only on the unsolved mystery and the plot to thrill and captivate  The characters pulled me in and each one made me feel like I was living their life  which made what was going on between the pages seem so real Paula Hawkins created a novel that had movement  At no time while I was reading did I feel like I was sitting still  I recommend this to any reader  regardless of which genre they love  This is simply a great book with skillful writing  layered characters  and an exceptional story  I just finished it and I already want to read it again  OMG  This book was so addictive  I couldn t stop reading the 100 last pages  I thought for myself  I want to know  I WANT TO KNOW    Someone said me that the ending of the book was a little predictable  but I don t think that  In the last chapters  even before the last Megan s Chapter  I started to connect all the details  till I found out who was the Megan s murderer  I don t think that the ending of the book is predictable  it s my opinion  of course   It could be predictable if in the end  the Megan s killer was her husband or Abdic  I think that Paul Hawkins had the talent that most of the Thriller s authors don t have  She made me think of all the possible options  that in the end  any of them were true  So  I loved it  I hope that in the future  this book can be adapted into a movie   Rachel is on a downward spiral  Her marriage has broken down  she has lost her job and her drinking is more than a small problem  Taking the commuter train to London  at peak times  each working day  she watches the world go by  rather than confronting it  As she observes the same people  in the same houses  each day  she begins to form a picture of them in her mind  Their names  their jobs and their routines  The fog of alcohol helps bring these people to life  for her  and when she hears that a young woman that she he has been watching  has disappeared without trace  the reality of what she has witnessed hits her with a bang  The only thing is  with a reputation as a drunk  prone to mental breakdown  will anyone believe her This debut novel is creating a lot of discussion at the moment  although not released until Jan  the reviewers have given it a resounding thumbs up  I agree  An addictive read from page one  Rachel is a character that demands attention  Her descent to her current level is drip fed to the reader and the pity  shame and despair that she feels is palpable  She is a victim of circumstance and there but for the Grace of God go I   The unsuspecting  actors  in her real life play are only seen for a few minutes each day  but she feels a connection to them  makes them part of her journey and her routine  The past is interlinked with this street and the alcohol keeps her connected more than she should be  Prone to blackouts after some of her drinking sessions  Rachel struggles to piece together the weak parts of her memory that may contain information about Megan  the missing girl  and the night she disappeared  Did she witness something or is it all related to her depressed and drunk state  The standard of this novel is high  Way high  Much stronger than Gone Girl  paced at break neck speed  hidden stories and twist and turns throughout  For fans of Into The Darkest Corner and Before I Go To Sleep  it is a superb psychological thriller  with hints of classic black and white Hitchcock movies throughout  A perfect way to escape reality  and may make you look at your fellow commuters in a new light  Sure to be a massive bestseller  Before going into this  I should highlight that I listened to an audiobook with amazing narrators  and that could have contributed towards the high rating I thoroughly enjoyed this novel  though I know a lot of people felt otherwise  I loved the narration  in the beginning  I felt like an outsider peering into the deepest recesses of Rachel s drunken creepy obsessive disturbed consciousness  I liked how the different narrators didn t sugar coat their feelings and expressed them candidly  The unreliable drunken narrator was definitely one of the highlights of this novel   I suspect the author  Paula Hawkins  made those train journeys that her character Rachel did  while sipping pre mixed gin and tonics   Much to my embarrassment  I could associate with Rachel s drunkenness  though hopefully that makes me a typical Londoner in his twenties  Anyway  Rachel  who appears to be a self loathing  snooping  anti hero ends up becoming the hero of the novel  which I very much liked  I also think the characters were believable  ranging from Megan  who suffered from anxiety and lacked direction  to the overly concerned not so best friend Cathy  to Tom  who wins the award for being the ultimate douchebag All in all  a great mystery thriller  and I look forward to reading more novels like this  Gone Girl  here I come    Page turning fast read  The change in perspectives through out the story adds a great element to the story  As a reader you taken down a rabbit hole of lies  betrayal  and guilt  There is red herring after red herring    Kaya  Adult ServicesReserve a library copy  The moment I finished this book  I said  wow   This is the best novel in any genre I ve read in a long  long time The story revolves around Rachel  who takes a commuter train every day and notices a couple she calls Jess and Jason  whose home backs onto the train track  Along the way  we learn about Rachel  her present and past life  and  Jess and Jason   The stories are woven together seamlessly  with a growing feeling of inevitability  The author s talent for telling a story is impressive We learn that Rachel is a mess  She is so flawed  you have to feel terrible for her  She is lonely and isolated and damaged  but finds that she is not ready to stop fighting her demons  I like how complex she is  how fragile and yet still alive  I really cared about her as I read this book  She makes so many mistakes  and during the story she becomes more aware of them and what she needs to do to stop making them  Other characters are layered  surprising  and complex as well  though I won t say more as I don t want to spoil the read for anyone The story is a thriller  a whodunit of the very best kind  There are red herrings and plot twists and dark back stories  Yes  I figured out who did it before the final reveal  but that was because the author led me there intentionally  And even so  there were surprises and revelations right up to and including the final page Various points of view and a shifting timeline are used to tell the story  The chapters are mostly short  with dates and names to help the reader  I thought this was an extremely effective tool  It kept the story just flying along  and it casually dropped shocking bits and pieces of characters  lives on the reader in totally believable ways In reviews  this book has often been compared to Gone Girl  There are some similar plot points  and they have the shifting narrative point of view in common  In my opinion  The Girl on the Train is by far the superior story  told by a far superior author  I love books that are told by multiple narrators  especially when you know that those stories will intersect one another at some point in the story   it is the waiting for that intersection to occur that gets me every time  It is like looking down on a road  waiting for cars  or trains  to collide with one another  This book was artfully written  and the moment when the narrator s stories connect is perfect  When I figured out who the bad guy girl was  I almost dropped to my knees  I was doing dishes and listening to the book  and that moment when my brain clicked all of the pieces together  it literally took my breath away  That    that is what makes a good book   I read  Girl on the Train  simply on recommendation and the fact that everywhere I looked  I saw or heard about Hawkins  novel  So due to its popularity  I thought I d give it a shot  Am I ever glad I did   Girl on the Train  tells the story of Rachel  a daily commuter who  while riding the train one day  witnesses an event that changes the lives of not just herself  but of several others  This book has been compared to  Gone Girl  and it is an accurate comparison  This book has the jerk husband  more than one actually in this case   the missing wife and the speculation that Flynn s novel has  as well as the suspense and the gripping storytelling  The characters are compelling and dysfunctional  which adds such a powerful emotional component to the story  I actively hated Anna for the majority of the book  right up until the end in fact  and when a reader holds such a strong opinion of a character  you know the writer has some insane talent  To think that this is Hawkins  first novel is surprising  however I am happy to hear this because it means that I did not miss any of her previous works  I will be lining up  alongside everyone else  to read anything else she creates Wow  This one was a wild ride from start to finish  The trio of women at the heart of this book  Rachel  Anna  and Megan  are all unreliable as narrators  The first is a blackout drunk  the second is a former mistress gone domestic  and the third is a serial cheater  Between the three of them  we get a story that is deliciously jumbled and fractured  and the truth is wonderfully hard to figure out  Literally every single one of the ensemble cast is messed up in some way  You d be hard pressed to find a single positive character in this book  I think it s safe to say there are  in the end  three couples in the centre of this book  Rachel and Tom  divorced   Tom and Anna  married with a baby   and Megan and Scott  married   Each brings their own set of problems to the table and each is absolutely vital to the story  None of them are trustworthy  though  At its core  The Girl on the Train is a book about love gone wrong  You can see it in Rachel  can see it in Megan  can see it in Scott  can see it even in Tom  It s a book about suspicion  and jealousy  and desperation  and rage  It s a book about loss  too  but it s also about the fact that you can t truly know someone just from glimpses into their life  In the same vein  it s a book that says you don t know the person you love the most as well as you think you do  It s quick paced and written relatively to the point  so it s an easy  enjoyable read As a quick end note  I absolutely love the e e cummings reference quite at the start of the book  and I love how it fits into the story like a charm  Life is not a paragraph  and death is no parenthesis   5 de 5 estrellasNo voy ha decir demasiado sobre el porque no se debe  hay que subirse al tren  mirar bien por la ventanilla y descubrir que sucede en el trayecto  Ha sido la novela del verano para mi  Si quieres sentir emocion  intriga y leer una buena historia  a por el   Loved it   This is nothing like I normally read but I thought it was brilliant  This book was hard to put down  Rachel you feel sorry for but are also angry with strange kind of character that is hard to cheer on  Spellbinding  When traveling I often wonder about the homes I pass and the people who live in them  This added whole other twist to your imagination  La trama esta muy bien hilada  y no sobra ni un solo parrafo  La historia es tan buena  que a veces perderas la nocion del tiempo mientras lees  No quiero contar mas  puesto que es una novela de intriga y misterio  con grandes dotes de suspense  http   www atrapadaenunashojasdepapel    Wow  I couldn t put this one down until I was finished  Great book   Rattled through this book in a day  Just could not bring myself to put it down  Ate  drank coffee and smoked cigarettes  all the while turning pages compulsively to see what happened next  Haven t read a book this good in years  Wish I d never read it so that I could read it again without knowing the plot  Loved the style and pace of the novel  loved the characters  loved the plot  Felt very real  totally authentic  Can t think of any real criticism  which for me is rare A totally unexpected gem  If you like psychological thrillers  I m pretty sure you ll love this  Phenomenally written  Best plot twists I ve read in quite some time   I really wish I could give half stars  I feel like this was a 4 5     leaning toward a 5  I listened to the entire book in less than 48 hours during a camping trip  I got it as a free download and figured I d give it a shot  though with all the hype about the book  I actually didn t know anything about the story  I m really glad I didn t because I enjoyed letting the story unfold  It was unpredictable  frustrating  compelling  amazing  A great modern mystery  I really enjoyed the audio experience for the most part  The readers for Rachel and Megan were good  though the voice for Anna didn t work for me  I think what I missed about the audio vs  a print copy  though  was the ability to work out the timeline for myself  There were times when the women s narrations matched up and overlapped  And then there were times when they did not  and it took me a while to figure out that one person was narrating in March while the others were narrating in July  for example   Page turner  As wild a read as  Gone Girl   Wow   I absolutely loved this book   I had to stop myself from reading it in one sitting   it s totally gripping a real page turner   I really liked the way it was written from the 3 women s perspectives and loved the way the story unfolded giving just enough glimpses to keep you second guessing right up to the end   this is a must read for anyone   best summer read so far   excellent book  Loved it  Loved it  Loved it  Psychological thriller  Could not put this book down  finished it in 2 days  I loved this book so much that I am anxious that my next read is not going to hold my interest  Going to change the genre to historical fiction because there is not another book in this genre that will be an equal match  Loved it   Did I say that already    I suppose we re all unreliable narrators of our own lives  Ask 10 witnesses what they see and you ll get 10 different answers  Over time  our memories shift like tectonic plates  so slowly that we don t realise we re creating our own version of the truth  It s human nature  which makes unreliable narrators the most terrifying of protagonists  They jump out of the page like new friends  drawing us into their deepest thoughts and sometimes making us forget that we don t really know them at all Hawkins  debut novel is astonishingly good and features all the hallmarks of a master thriller  Much like Gone Girl  the story revolves around a missing wife and the dangerous question  what really happened   But that s where the comparison ends  The Girl on the Train is executed with far more intensity  the tension building amongst the trio of unreliable narrators  until we can t be sure what to believe anymore  Hawkins has certainly set the bar high for thrillers in 2015  I can t wait to see what she comes up with next  Wow  Just wow  I don t usually read thriller  but that was so much worth it I have a love hate relationship with this book  Everything about the character is absolutely repulsive  They re so repulsive that I ve eventually pitied them  Especially Rachel  I pitied her so much  She s so pathetic  but I sympathized with her  I HATE TOM  He s so infuriating  I was so happy with the ending  It was the poetic justice I anticipated  I really liked the writing style and the thrilling vibes  Overall  I loved it  But hated the characters  that s how I know the author succeeded  excellent  I lost sleep to finish this  totally unique and unpredictable Awesome book Lots of twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat until the end  I could not put the book down  http   sylwiasbookshelf com the girl    As you might have guessed the book is about a girl on a train    Every day she takes the same train and stares into the windows of the same house  Until one day she sees something terrible  which she can t keep to herself  Sounds a bit creepy  It did to me  and that s why it got my attention  I was really curious about what Rachel saw  What could she have seen that was so horrifying  And then I got to the part where she sees it  and I thought  well  it s not really that terrible  But it was what happened next that was truly terrifying  How it would change her whole life so dramatically that she would never be able to forget it Paula Hawkins introduces a few different characters who  seemingly  are not connected at all  You might think they re just part of a side plot  but she has a plan for every one of them  At first it seemed like I had everything figured out and nothing was going to surprise me  and then Paula delivers a massive twist that I haven t seen coming at all   Now when I think of it after I ve read the book  it was kind of obvious  and couldn t have been any other way  But she so skillfully diverted my attention to other details  that I was really stunned by the sudden change of events Throughout the book the story is very well paced with a lot going on and a lot to think about and try to figure out  As is the case with most books  there s just a a bit in the middle where the story slows down a bit  But do not quit there  It s just a devious trick by Paula just so she can take you by surprise with a twist a couple of chapters later    A bit of the  calm before the storm  idea  so keep reading  All is Not as it SeemsA girl on a train  a perfect couple  a horrible crime  secrets and lies  Many  many lies  Unable to cope with her past and her current situation  Rachel Watson invents a fantasy life for a young  vibrant couple that she observes on her daily train commute into London  An alcoholic  Rachel s obsession with this couple fills the emotional void in her life and the alarming gaps in her memory  When a horrible crime rocks her small suburb  Rachel must face her demons in order to learn the truth  But exactly what is the truth and who  if anyone  is telling it  Paula Hawkins weaves a complicated web of deceit in which all the players see the same events through their own clouded perceptions  The reader is kept guessing as Rachel is drawn further and further into the mystery and each character s secrets are unraveled  And everyone  including Rachel herself  is lying to protect their darkest truth In the same vein as a Hitchcock movie or a Gillian Flynn novel  The Girl on the Train is filled with suspense and twists  The reader s loyalty shifts from one character to the next at the hand of Hawkins  masterful storytelling  Her characters are deeply flawed  yet extremely compelling  Although I found Rachel to be loathsome at times  I was rooting for her to overcome her personal battles and find peace   Muy bueno nada mas comenzarlo me ha enganchado y no podia parar de leer  Evitare spoilers para no desvelar nada sobre la trama Solo decir que lo recomiendo a todo aquel que les gusten los libros de suspense  Talk about a page turner  I got to the point where I never wanted to stop listening to this book  Every time I thought I had it figured out  something else surprised me  The characters are incredibly interesting  and I like that they are not one dimensional   The Girl On The Train is a great thriller  packed with twists and turns and complex characters  There is a lot of hype about this book  I don t pay attention to hype or use it to make judgement about books  I wanted to read this because it sounded right up my street   the kind of thriller I love  I was right  The book exceeded my expectations  I thought the characterisation was brilliant  The book is narrated from the point of view of three women  Rachel  the girl on the train who s unemployed and has a serious drink problem which has gotten worse since her husband left her for someone else two years before  Anna  the woman Rachel s husband left her for and Megan  the woman Rachel watches from the train and projects her happiness fantasies onto  Rachel is my favourite character  she s so messed up  holding onto her sanity by a thread and wonderfully real  I really like the way the book moves between the viewpoints of these three women so you get to see what s going on from different angles  This can work really well and the author pulls it off  As for the plot  I thought this was a great  original thriller  There was so much going on  This one of those books where the author makes you think about twenty different things are going on and when the truth is revealed at the end of the novel it s the opposite of what you ve thought all along  I absolutely love it when an author surprises me  I loved The Girl On The Train  If you like psychological thrillers you must read this  Unputdownable  SO GOOD   10X Better Than Gone GirlThis is the best book I ve read in 2 3 years  and I read 60  books per year   Terrific plot  engaging characters  wonderful writing    this book has it all Read it now  You ll be glad you did  The Girl on the train had my complete attention  The story is narrated in first person by three women whose lives cross  The main character is Rachel  an extremely flawed woman who drinks so much that she has blackouts  When she reports an important finding related to a missing woman  she is not taken seriously  After one of her many blackouts she thinks she saw something significant  but just can t remember  Her struggles to try and reclaim that memory puts her in progressively worsening danger  I really loved the suspense and the unpredictability of the story  The characters here believable   especially Rachel and he alcoholism  It s one of those books that s keep you in suspense until the very end  I highly recommend it  Loved it  Very suspenseful and characters that were interesting  Similar to Gillian Flynn   read it in three days because I couldn t put it down  Great book  in the same way that Gone Girl was a great book  Read it straight through cover to cover in two days  Gripping storyline follows a woman  her ex  his new wife  and the neighbors down the street  But who dunnit  This book was everywhere months ago  so not wanting to miss out on the latest great thing  I ordered a copy from the library  In my current assignment laden state I only read about the first chapter before it was due back  It took me a while to decide whether I would attempt another request  Rachel  the main character whose perspective we begin with is really disconcerting  I wasn t entirely sure I wanted to inhabit her brain again I finally had another crack and all I can say is  brilliant  With a motley cast of characters whose behaviour and motives are very slippery  it kept me hooked  second time around   It sort of vaguely sits in the same genre as  Gone Girl  although in a very British rather than American way Worth reading if you don t mind a little bit of gritty in your fiction  Fast paced  once I figured out who the villain was  I had to race to get to the finale  Immensely enjoyed this and really struggled to put it down  I was engrossed by the intrigue right from the start  constantly re guessing possible outcomes   It started a little slow for but only a bit   Sometimes only details do that to me  when nothing is happening  But I believe those details are necessary for us to understand everything before anything major happens so I kept going  After a few chapters  it was nearly impossible for me to put the book down  This book made me stay in one place for 5hours until I finished the entire thing  I generally do not like unstable or sad  depressed main characters and I still couldnt stop reading this  The ending of course blew me away   I cannot wait for the movie  I was jumping up and down when I found out  I loved the style in which the story is written  It goes back and forth between what happened before and what s happening now which I think is a major reason why it hooks the reader to the book LOL  We all wanna know what it was that happened back then  Ughhh  Anyway  it s been a loooong time since I liked a book this much  I ll definitely be looking for the author s other books   Popularne knjige me obicno razocaraju  ali ova nije  Ima izvrsnu krimi radnju  ispricanu iz prvog lica od strane tri zenska lika   odlicno razradene likove  sa svim vrlinama i manama   odlicno pogoden tempo  bilo mi je neobicno da se treci lik pojavljuje tako kasno  ali se to pokazalo opravdanim   U svakom slucaju izvrsna knjiga  new favorite author  can t stop reading this book  can t wait for new ones from the this author great read Great suspense  Loved it  Kept my interest till the end  Would recommend to anyone especially those who liked Gone Girl  Good thriller of the domestic kind  Page turner not only because of the well paced unfurling of the mystery but also because of the unpretentious writing  The portrayal of the main character as an alcoholic and depressive  as well as her yearning for an alternative sounded plausible for t he most part   Good read  This would make an excellent movie too   if it s done right that is  Let me first get this out of the way   The Girl on the Train  by Paula Hawkins is this year s must read book Very soon  the innards  and outards  of this debut novel will be covered in praise filled quotes written by successful mainstream writers and glossy magazine editors  the magazines being glossy  not the editors   And once it enters the Oprahsphere     well  we all know what happens then You ll buy it   download it   borrow it   whatever it  Maybe you ll even read it while you are commuting on the train   Would that be ironic or coincidental  I always get those confused  But  bottom line  and all cliches aside  you ll read  The Girl on the Train  and you ll like it  And not in that overcooked  unbuttered Brussels sprouts kind of way It s the story of Rachel  a drunken ex wife whose bitterness is all consuming  Then there s Anna    she s the reason Rachel is an ex wife  Finally  Megan  who consumes Rachel and pisses off Anna  Sounds like a fun bunch  huh These women are three of the most unlikeable people you ll ever meet  They are not welcome at your girls  night out  They will  however  still manage to ruin your weekend plans   Sorry  no can do   you ll mumble as you click your way through your Kindle  drawn in by Hawkins  intricate crafting of a story that hits those trigger points that catapult a novel to the top of the best sellers list Rachel  a rapid fire  gin and tonic lush with wanderlust  commutes to London via train every day  Along the way  she watches Megan  for whom our traveler has created this fantasy life  They ve never met  their lives separated by the train s window  It s in that driver s seat of sorts that Rachel s given Megan a made up name  Jess  and made up life  perfect   fueling her  what if  mantra and allowing her some control over her out of control existence But Rachel s fantasy has seismic faults Megan  aka Jess  has a real life  living a few houses away from Anna  you know  the  insert derogatory noun here  who stole Rachel s husband and who in someone else s novel surely would wind up dead  But that would be too simple  too Lifetime movie ish  here  Instead  Hawkins dumps Megan s corpse in a park and it s then that things get     well  weirder Rachel  no longer the voyeur  slides into sleuth mode  inserting herself into the world she is no longer    and hasn t been for some time    welcome  Into this turmoil  Hawkins offers up a couple of seemingly nice    but deep down  you know they re twisted    husbands  as well as a therapist who probably could use a self help book Add those slices of lime to Rachel s gin and tonics  and    voila     you ve got yourself ordering another round from Hawkins  This book kept me guessing throughout  I thought I had it figured out  but the twists and turns just kept coming  I liked how bits and pieces of each character s history were revealed throughout the story  Having lived in Chicago  I totally get the fascination with seeing people and their homes as you speed by on the train  I know a lot of books these days are written from the perspective of several different characters  but I do enjoy that  You re able to gain a better understanding of the different characters  If you enjoyed Gone Girl  you ll love The Girl on the Train  I read this a couple of months ago just because of all the hype surrounding it  This is not my usual style of book but i gave it a go  This is the first book i have read by Paula  certainly not the last I finished this in a day  i could not put it down   even cancelled my lunch date so i could finish it  oops  This was an excellent storyline that was filled with many twists   turns  Untill near to the end i could not see where this was going  Boy have i not read a book like this in a long time   if ever    Loved the charactors throughout and i really felt i had jumped into the story  Would reccomend this to anyone  I really wasn t impressed with this book to begin with  I found myself rolling my eyes at it saying  why do people like this    Then something changed  It became a WONDERFUL read  I loved it  I was confused  I wanted answers and boy was I SURPRISED   I loved this book  Couldn t put it down and finished it in 2 days  Fast  compelling  scary  Its everything everyone is saying about it  What s better than a couple snow days and a book that sucks you in  Not much  Great mystery that kept me completely enthralled  I even wanted to read it while sitting at stop lights   There is this place   in all of our lives   where we begin to wonder if everything we thought were true  and real  becomes an illusion  That is where this book takes you  Great read   great thriller  Highly recommend for female readers who enjoy suspense  We are tied together forever  bound by the stories we told  READ THIS BOOK  What a fantastic ride it was  Excellent plot  amazing twists in the story  strong characters  perfect ending  fantastic writing  all wrapped up in a 316 page package  I thoroughly enjoyed watching Rachel s personal journey and cheered every realization she had about herself and the mystery she found herself tangled up in  Though I did figure out whodunit  normally  this drives me nuts   I was caught by surprise by the revelations of which events were real and which weren t  I want everyone to read this book so we can discuss it   Really great book  You keep thinking you know what s next and it surprises you  I like being surprised at the end  Such a well thought out plot  Very thrilling I didn t want to stop   Easily one of the best books I ve read lately  Or ever I loved this book While it s my general nature to cast a skeptical eye towards anything that seems overly  popular   in this case I must conclude that sometimes the  it  book is  it  for a reason As mysteries go it was so refreshingly un mystery like  devoid of the usual cliche devices so often used to advance a murder plot  What a story  Pathos  really  which I found very intriguing and unique  So engrossing that I almost forgot there was a mystery to be solved  That s really saying something The main character is incredibly flawed  heads up  if that s not your thing  in a way that made it  to me  very interesting  Really a different sort of main character in a mystery  with a really different angle on reaching a solution which  let me tell you  is spellbinding If you see this book compared to Gone Girl  consider that apropos only in that they are each fantastic books  The Girl on the Train is every bit its own  And great Five  yeah  Five Stars   UCBC Rating 4 87  Loved it  I m guessing it will be in the theaters soon   This has to be the thriller of the year  It keeps you gasping for air with all the twists and turns  Even though I was right quite early on who the killer was  it was still interesting to see how it got to that point  Highly recommended   The Girl on the Train is a compelling novel written by Paula Hawkins  It depicts the story of Rachel  Megan  and Anna  three women intertwined by the same man  The reader first meets Rachel  the girl on the train who takes it every morning and watches her Jess and Jason sit on their porch as the train passes by  One Morning  Rachel watches Jess as she stands up to passinotley kiss a man who isn t Jason  The next morning  Jess is missing  As Rachel tries to find out what happened to Jess  Hawkins tells a thrilling adventure of loss and love and hurt and sorrow  The Girl on the Train is such an outstanding debut novel that it will leave the reader craving more  I rated this book 5 stars because it is very well written and I absoulutley enjoyed it  I am really stunned that this is Hawkins  first novel because it is amazing  The plot  the switch from charcter to charcter  the dynamics  the story line  AMAZING    I also really enjoyed how Hawkins finished off the novel  She left the reader with just enough closuer and just enough room for imagination  I would reccomend this book to those who espically liked Gone Girl and to those who want a good read  Honestly  I think it s one of my favorite books so far  And it s not thriller  mystery part of this book that makes it special  That makes it intriguing and keeps the focus of the book  But it s something else    Detailed description of pain  of misery  of abandonment are the core points of this book The topic of this book is so deep that I m not surprised that some readers cannot appreciate it fully  It s not an action book  It s like a confession  It is a way to look into lifes of others  No wonder some people are trying it out  never going onto all its depth and criticising the book  It s purpose is far from just being one more exciting and fun read It touches sacral   humans misery and pain  It s not ment to be amusing  It meant to be revealing For me it s a masterpiece  Tudo neste livro e excelente  A capa  a escrita  as personagens  todo o enredo que me cativou desde a primeira pagina  e o facto de podermos ver tres pontos de vista de personagens tao importantes Definitivamente 5 estrelas  Couldn t put this book down  great psychological easy read  loved it  This was the July selection for Page Turners Book Club and what a pick  I debated between four and five stars for this one and finally settled on the full five  Why  Because this book knocks it out of the park for what it is trying to achieve  Is this a book that s going to change the way you see the world  No  Is this a book that s going to present big ideas or explore complex aspects of life  No  But is it a book that grabs you and just pulls you through every page because it s intense  engaging  and suspenseful  Absolutely  I can understand the comparisons to Gone Girl  but I actually found this a much more enjoyable read  We have an unreliable narrator who works to unravel her own spotty memory and at times you just want to jump into the book and shake a few more details out of her brain  This was NOT a book to read late at night and I made it about 40  of the way in and then just plowed through until the end  staying up 2 hours past bedtime to finish  Great read and one that makes the entire rest of the world disappear once it gets a hold of you  This was a tense thriller and I enjoyed it  Cool how it is told through different voices  Holy  Crap   Yep  It s good  It s about a girl who is struggling with alcoholism  who travels daily on the train  She may or may not have witnessed a crime  She may or may not have committed the crime herself  She honestly does not know  Because whenever she is drunk  she blacks out and has no recollection whatsoever of what happened while she was drunk  She sets out to find the truth  But the closer she gets to the truth  the closer she gets to endangering her own life  A lot of people have compared this to Gone Girl  Yes  they are both psychological thrillers  Yes  they are both good  But I never once thought of Gone Girl when I read this book  The book that kept coming to my mind  the book I kept comparing this book to  was   Before I Go To Sleep by S J Watson  Another excellent read  All three get 5 stars from me  Fast  fun  interesting read  I couldn t put it down once I really got started  So good  Suspenseful    Really easy read because I couldn t put it down   This is our book club pick and I really enjoyed it  Even though I guessed a huge part of the mystery at 29   there were still lots of other surprises that kept me interested  I loved the short chapters and alternating points of view  I also really enjoyed the whole idea of how all of Rachel s life and her obsessions seem to revolve around the train lines  That ending  hot damn  was not expecting that  which is kind of the point of the book  Enjoyed and devoured  What a ride  I couldn t get off this train until I finished the entire story in one sitting  Paula Hawkins is a master at telling a story and diverting attention from the real crime and criminal  It was a satisfying psychological thriller  Recommended  Loved this book  I was completely engrossed from the first page to the last  One of the best written books I ve read in a long time  The book starts off a little slow but quickly picks up after the first few chapters  Rachel is an alcoholic divorcee who rides the train back and forth everyday between work and where she is living  Along the route she has to pass the home she once shared with her husband  She spends the duration of her rides daydreaming about the people who live in the neighborhood next to her old home  something terrible happens and before you know it she finds herself involved with the case  This book is a mystery thriller  Hard to put down   Una historia llena de los comportamientos humanos que no solemos sentarnos a pensar La forma de escribir y de dividir asincronamente la trama principal  me parecio cautivadora de principio a fin  Crazy twisty  If you liked Gone Girl    You ll like this  Bloody brilliant  Fun book to read  I love the differing viewpoints  I really had no idea till the end how it was going to turn out  This book blew my mind  It started a little slow for my taste  but once I got into it the suspense kept me engaged  I totally did not expect Tom to be a killer    Throughout the book I often wondered if Rachel had a history of trauma and believe she demonstrated several traits of borderline personality disorder  i e   issues with boundaries   Kamal was extremely unprofessional and was unethical by befriending Megan  allowing her to come to his house  how did she even know where he lived    kissing and touching Megan  etc  However  overall this book was highly enjoyable and I would recommend it  I am still recovering this book  I devoured it in three days  but trust me  you can finish it in one sitting   between maddening work deadlines and an afternoon of convalescing at home from one of the worst bouts of menstrual agony  You can not put this book down  It distracted me from urgent obligations of my occupation  And when my eyelids were leaden and sleep was crying to be heard  I put on another kettle and charged through to the very end  The book begins with the introduction of one of the most hopelessly flawed protagonists of the fictional world  Rachel  a lonely train commuter consumed in drunken reveries of her past and the couple who lives in House number 16 on Blenheim Street that she observes with passion on every commute  On one of these droll morning commutes  Rachel sees something that she cannot unsee and what follows after is a wild search for answers  each step revealing more filth and menace  One line to best encapsulate the book  A bunch of lunatics  each more repugnant than the other  entangled in a labyrinthine of a mystery  But oh is it one palpitating  dangerously engrossing  and creepy AF mystery that you can not forget   This was a great book  I love a book that can be very interesting and still not tell you anything until the very end  I did feel that there were one or two unanswered questions and that always peeves me  Because of that  I would have done 4 5 stars if it was available  What a good page turner  brilliant book full of suspense and wonder with a great finale I was hooked really engrossing read So far  this is one of my favorite books of 2015  While being compared to Gone Girl  the only similarity that I can see is that both are psychological thrillers  I did not figure out the ending and I was surprised  I liked the way the book was written  from the points of view of the three main characters  Rachel  Megan and Anna  None of the characters in the book was particularly likeable  except maybe Rachel s roommate  As Rachel was an unreliable narrator  she had black outs and could not remember what she did or saw   I really had no idea which way the book was going to go  there were lots of twists and turns  The author  Paula Hawkins  is a wonderful writer and I thought the characters were all well written  Like Rachel  I too would be daydreaming and imagining lives about the people I would see if I were passing by on a commuter train  so I found this book very believable  bad things happened to her every time she drank  I would ve thought she would try to curb it more  but she was pretty hopeless  I have one question that I must have missed in the reading   what happened to Megan s child that she lost years ago  How did she die   an illness  an accident  or what  Although the book was dark and somewhat depressing  it kept me enthralled until the end and I highly recommend it  I hope our book discussion next week is a good one  This book flowed easily from start to finish  without any hard or slow sections  The ever building suspense made for a top notch psychological thriller that I read in every spare moment over a couple of days  Great entertainment  Wow  Keeps you guessing from beginning to end  Recommended  especially if Gone Girl was a  like  for you  The fact that I immediately wanted to give The Girl on the Train five stars is almost strange given that there isn t one single totally likable character Told by three main female characters  each is so flawed that you almost feel like you can t empathize or sympathize with any of them  Rachel is a raging alcoholic who drinks gin and tonics out of a can on the train home from work and regularly drinks herself into a blackout Anna is a smug mistress turned wife who married Rachel s ex husband immediately after they split Megan is a bored wife who entertains running away from her loving husband daily  and enjoys romps with other men to dull the drudgery of married life They all sound like they should be awful and none of them are reliable witnesses to the world around them  And yet as the story weaves itself following the investigation of a missing woman  you can t help but feel sorry for each of them in different ways In the end  not one of them is a bad person  they re just each heavily flawed characters I found myself thinking I couldn t relate to any of them at all only to realize there will little things about each of them that yes  I could relate to or at least understand I especially love that Rachel makes up stories in her head about Megan and her husband Scott  whom she names Jess and Jason as she doesn t know them   creating a fictional life for them as she passes their house each day on the train  I ve occasionally done the same  though to less of a crazy obsessive degree as Rachel   while bored on the bus so that was kind of a nice touch I don t often read  whodunit  thrillers but I loved this one  It s so fast paced  it s almost impossible to put down  I read it in less than three days  a rarity for me   and I didn t have my revelation moment where I guessed who the culprit was until very late in the book Well done  loved it tremendously  Great read for vacation  Kept me guessing  i hvnt read a mystery novel in a while this one was a page turner  i really loved it  WOW  What an outstanding read  If Alfred Hitchcock was alive and wrote a book  this would have been the result  Fast paced  can t wait to read the next page  thrilling  and all in all  a terrific  not to be missed book  I understand  according to Listopia  this book was the first book read in 2015 among the 40 somethings   Do yourself a favor and read this book  Most people read it in a day  it took me about 10 days 5 stars Fiewww finally i finished it     This book was really breathtaking to me   Bener bener tak terduga  aku baru bisa nebak si pelaku baru pada akhir akhir cerita Diceritakan dalam 3 sudut pandang  Rachel  yang paling banyak berperan disini   Megan dan Anna Semua berawal dari Rachel Wanita pecandu alkohol yang hidupnya berantakan sejak suaminya berselingkuh dan bercerai dari nya  Hmmm  sebelum bercerai dia juga udah mulai depresi sih   Rachel yang tiap hari pulang pergi naik kereta tujuan London  selalu memantau pasangan suami istri Jason dab Jess  bukan nama asli mereka  di balik Jendela kereta  setiap kali Kereta tersebut berhenti di Palang Lampu lalu lintas kereta Sebenernya Si Rachel ini udah dipecar dari pekerjaan nya hampir sebulan lamanya  Demi tetep keliatan masih seorang employee dia lakuin itu tiap hari  pergi jam pagi pulang nya malem  Supaya flat mate nya ga curiga kalau ia sudah pengangguran  Dia hobi banget merhatiin tingkah laku suami istri Jason dan jess itu karena menurutnya  mereka pasangan sempurna dan saling menyayangi  Mirip seperti hidupnya dulu sewaktu masih bahagia dengan Si Tom  suaminya Suatu hari dia ngelihat si Jess ini couman sama lelaki lain  alias havingan affair  runtuh sudah lah image dia ttg pasangan sempurna nya Nah  yang lebih gawat nya keesokan harinya si Jess ini dinyatakan hilang Rachel berusaha mengungkapkan apa yang dialamin Jess  dengan berpura pura jadi temen nya si Jess kepada Jason  Dia berhutang kepada Jason ttg si Jess yang punya affair Yang lebih parah nya ini  karena dia alkoholik ga ada yang percaya sama omongan nya si Rachel  karena ingatan dia sendiri blur gitu  jadi pengakuan dia sering berubah ubah Disinilah dimulai nya semua misteri hilang nya Jess  Satu sama lain ternyata bersangkutan Bener bener keren ceritanya   Bikin gue rela begadang ngabisin ceritanya    Ps  Hati hati sama orang terdekatmu  entah itu keluarga atau tetangga mu   Bisa jadi dia seorang psycopat  p  p Intriguing and very Gone Girlish  This book kept me engaged and was difficult to put down   I really enjoyed this book  It is a whodounit different from others  I found that the main character had sufficient depth to make it different than most  A girl takes the train every day and it stops at the same spot waiting for a light to change  It stop very close to where she used to live with her ex husband during happier days  Yet she does not look there  she stares at a house a few numbers down where lives a couple appearing blissfully in love  With time  she gets tangled in their life in a way that it is hard to extirpate herself from it  This was everything I want in a mystery thriller  a compelling but flawed  and unreliable  protagonist  a plot that pulls you in within the first few pages and tightens the reigns on your attention as the chapters go on  and characters that you think you have figured out but end up surprising you  I loved that  slight spoiler alert  The Girl on the Train had an actual  literal red herring in the red headed stranger on the train  When I finished the book I couldn t help but laugh about that At first I was worried that the choppy morning night way of telling the story would get grating and wear on my nerves  but the writing was so good that I barely noticed  I loved how much I cared about and also was annoyed as hell with Rachel  She was such a mess  but as the story went on  I began to suspect why  It was satisfying to have those suspicions confirmed As someone who reads a lot of mystery thrillers  I was also pleasantly surprised by how long it took me to figure out who the  bad guy  was  I knew before the  reveal  but not too much before  which is rare for me  Hawkins did an excellent job of taking the reader on a ride  and telling the story in just enough pieces to keep us turning the pages I rarely give 5 star reviews but The Girl on the Train deserves it  I know some say this book has some predictability in it  I agree because I figured out things about half way through but the reason I rated it five stars was because it was easy to read and engaged me  I read 300 pages in one day to finish it  I think it deserves a five star rating because I didn t want to put it down   This is psychological suspense at its absolute best  There s no waiting for the tension to build  it s there from the first chapter on  And near the end you can just forget about putting it down   THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a dark  haunting and depressing psychological thriller  but it s incredibly effective thanks to the writing skills of author Paula Hawkins  Rachel is a divorced woman who would do anything for a drink  and like a lot of folks consumed by a love affair with the bottle  one might call her a victim of circumstances  Her husband Tom had an affair that resulted in a pregnancy  He divorced Rachel  married the  other woman  and now all three  husband  wife and child  are happily ensconced in the house that was once Rachel s The train that Rachel rides to London each day takes her past her old neighborhood  From the window of the train she observes not only her old garden that backs up to the tracks  but also the daily activities of another couple who reside down the street from her previous home  In her imagination she has given the couple names and has created a fairy tale love life for them  Real life  however  cannot live up to her fantasy and the couple does not have the picture perfect relationship that Rachel has concocted  When a murder occurs  Rachel becomes entangled in the investigation because of what she has witnessed on her daily commute This rather bleak story with intersecting timelines is told from the viewpoint of three different women Rachel  Anne and Megan  All the women are unreliable narrators with something to hide  In fact  most of the characters in this novel  including the men  lack veracity  and are a self serving and unsympathetic group with plenty of skeletons in their closets Lest I continue and divulge too much of the plot  let me just say that the twists and turns in the story are many and readers will be easily drawn in  making it easy to devour this book in one afternoon  I had read about this book  which sounded something like  Rear Window  on a train  which was what influenced me to read it It starts with the central character  Rachel  taking her everyday train into work and observing people on the train and people who she sees out of the window  as well as a mysterious pile of clothes on the track  She takes an interest in one particular couple  until a few chapters in when it is revealed that the girlfriend  Megan  has gone missing Rachel immediately assumes the mantle of detective and starts her own investigation  getting close to Megan s boyfriend Scott by lying about who she is  It does become apparent early on that Rachel is not perfect  she is a recovering alcoholic  who had a bad breakup with her husband Tom  Tom s new wife Anna clearly hates her  and there is also the issue that she had a blackout the night that Megan disappeared  and suddenly Tom and Anna were angry at her  and she has no idea why I loved the narrative style of the book  written mostly in the present tense  in the form of memoirs and from the point of view  of Rachel  Megan and Anna  the point of view alternates throughout the book  and occasionally moves back and forth in the timeline  Megan s chapters are all told in flashback  not too surprisingly  I liked seeing the world through Rachel s eyes  and then seeing her from the point of view of Anna  It was a good way of giving the characters personality and making me care for Rachel  Megan and  eventually  Anna I loved the way that the book kept me guessing  and I found it gripping right to the end  I love the switching of narrators  each more unreliable than the other   For her first novel paula did a great jop   really great jop  I love all the characters  i feel sorry for racheal   i don t like her weakness   i hate her weakness   paula did good on building up the characters   Everyone of them was kind mystery   and the surprised form the first to the end we re thrilled  even in the end it just show how hard paula worked on it  the sequence of it are just suitable and in their right pages   it make me curios and take my attention  and i kept imagining every seance   thats what a good novel should do   and it did it so its worth to be one of the best in 2015 and I m glad that i read it   and i ll do it again cause i think one read isn t enough for it and beside there is no boring in it at all     There is quite a bit of buzz about this book at the moment on Goodreads  Nearly everyone who has read it is raving about it  so I was keen to see if it lives up to the hype   and it does  It is a very tense psychological mystery that really kept me on my toes as I read  turning the pages  not wanting to put it down until I had worked it all out The train that Rachel commutes on every day always pauses at the same signal and she uses that time every day to people watch   taking a little glimpse of the couple she sees every day on their deck  creating her own little life for them  One day  however  she sees something that doesn t add up  something that draws her deep into events that are way over her head The story is told from three different viewpoints and I really enjoyed each one  as each gave a slightly different take on the story  There are a number of characters and all are complex and flawed  They lie  cheat and deceive and so nothing is really as it first appears and  more importantly  nobody is as they first seem  I did work out what was going on  but only just before it became apparent in the book  and I was still kept eagerly reading on to check if I had got it correct I don t like to say things like  If you liked XXX then you will like this   but if you do like psychological  twisty turny tense reads then this should be right up your street  Many thanks to the publisher for the review copy  I couldn t put this book down  Each page left behind a breadcrumb that just left me wanting more  The author took care to reveal the true nature of each character slowly and methodically  The end result was a rewarding read  Voyeurism  unfaithful spouses  blackout drinking  paranoia  shame  hope  fear  betrayal  murder  revenge  this whodunit has it all  Paula Hawkins throws everything at us but the kitchen sink and  just like Oliver Twist  we re left at the end  hands outstretched  plaintively beseeching   Please  Ma am  may we have some more   The Girl On The Train locks you in early and doesn t let go until the last line is left reverberating in your head  If you look up  page tuner  in the dictionary  it will most likely reference this novel  An excellent read  I look forward to whatever Hawkins publishes next   Made you think all the way through I loved this book  Easy read  Good twist  Main character totally pathetic    but that s what kept it interesting  If you have a little voyeur in you  you ll love it  LOL Holy crap  it did come out of nowhere  LOVED IT  better than woebegone girl  This review is originally posted on  http   wp me p5m5jd at Disclaimer  I obtained this copy of ARC from the publisher in exchange for my honest review The Girl on the Train is a fast paced  dark  disturbing  mysterious and propelling psychological thriller that not to be missed Narrated in first person POV alternating among 3 women in different chapters  I m able to see that every one of them has their own secrets not to be told to anyone  including their closest ones  They have their own issues in life and their hatred towards other persons in their lives Plot    The story started with Rachel  who commutes twice daily during weekdays on a train between Ashbury and Euston  The train will stop at a signal point where she can look outside the window at the houses at Blenheim Road  Witney   particularly at Number 15 and Number 23 Every weekdays when she s on the train  she s very eager to be able to look at the Number 15 house with a couple she named them as Jess and Jason  She would never expect she could be able to know them personally until one day  something terrible happened that linked them together I like how the writer put the little pieces together to make the 3 women who seems unrelated to become related in some ways  some how  And all these little pieces makes the story full of mysteries which I m quite shocked and thrilled at the part near the ending of the story Characters          Even though the book has 3 narrators  Rachel Watson plays a major part in the story Rachel is an alcoholic who couldn t accept the fact of her divorce and she even lost her job because of her drinking problems  Most of the time  I would think that she s a mess and quite hopeless in getting herself back to her normal life and she definitely needs help from AA  Alcoholic Anonymous   Sometimes I might think that she s getting better as she doesn t drink for a couple of days but I m quite disappointed when she picks up that bottle of wine or tin of gin and tonic again Another narrator of the story is Megan who lives at Number 15 and being labelled as  Jess  by Rachel  She babysits Tom and Anna s daughter who live at Number 23  She has a troubled past that she never tell her husband  Scott  Rachel s  Jason    The lives of these 3 women change after Megan went missing Anna  who seems like the happiest lady among the 3 narrators gave birth to Evie after she married Tom  Even so  she hates Rachel and occasionally she ll get stressed by the nonsense caused by Rachel The other two characters narrated in the story are Tom and Scott  Both Tom and Scott are loving husbands and to others  they are the dream man of most of the women  But when I read through the story  it s unbearable to know the dark side of every characters Conclusion          I ve read Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn before I pick up this book  But I m not going to compare them even though they have some similarities like missing girl After finished reading this book  I asked myself   Do I feel sorry for the women in the book   I would say no  Even though you would say that the unfortunate events happened to them deserves my sympathy but I think that somehow they need to be responsible for what they did Take Rachel for example  she knows that it s her own fault to become a drinker  But did she help herself to get rid of the  disease   There are a lot of times we would expect others to take the blame when something bad happened to us  But before that  have you ever think of any other things that you can do to make it better Overall  this book is a page turner and basically I would resist the urge to put down the book and get to sleep especially when Megan went missing  So I m not surprised to know that a staff of the publisher was reading the book secretly under the table during a meeting because she was at twelve pages from the end This book is highly recommended to the readers who love thrillers and even if you don t read thrillers  try it out  Depois de Gillian Flynn  e das comparacoes feitas entre a autora e Paula Hawkins  li o livro com o dobro do cuidado  nao fosse alguem dar numa de Amy Dunne  Os comentarios a volta da Rapariga no Comboio foram pressagios   o livro arrebatou  com ou sem aviso  nao se importou que eu nao confia se em nenhuma das personagens  a uma certa altura ate se desconfia da vitima  nao va estar viva afinal  Fica como um dos melhores de 2015  recomendacao enorme   vamos ver em quem confias  so para seres provada errada uma e outra vez   Definitely liked this one  It made my skin crawl in parts  It s one of those books that makes you worried that maybe you don t actually know anyone around you  I have been dreading writing this review because from the beginning I hated the main character  I found Rachel extremely irritating  a drunk girl who threw everything away and insisted in feeling sorry for herself  The reason I didn t stop reading was because I do not like to not finish a book      but then I still give 5 stars  why  Because this book will blow your mind  You will doubt everything you think you know  and will want to re read it just to see how many clues you have missed The characters are complex and seriously troubled  The book will take you on quite a ride  So many twists and turns  Cannot give it away  It is destined to be a brilliant movie  I can understand why it is being compared to  Gone Girl   and I really hope that who ever makes the movie keeps close to the original book   Review  The Girl on the Train   Cogito Ergo Sumhttps   elexithymia wordpress com 201    The Girl on The Train by Paula Hawkins    OMG  This has to be one of my absolute favorite reads so far this year  Murder  obsession  evil  jealousy  cruelty and heartbreaking at times  The Girl on The Train has what it takes to keep you turning those pages and let me tell you    the twist at the end will have your jaw drop  It is so deceptively simple in some ways  that as you are reading  suddenly the sun is setting  day turns into night and your eyes have not left the page  I wasn t furiously turning the pages  I was absentmindedly turning the pages because I was so engrossed in the story Here s the gist    Rachel Watson rides the train everyday past a housing complex and becomes obsessed with this couple she sees most days lounging on their patio    until Rachel sees something that she shouldn t see  But because Rachel has some problems of her own  when she tries to tell someone what she saw  no one believes her    until    Read this book  Both a great murder mystery and literary fiction  Well written characters  a leading lady that you can empathize with  and a great story  If Hitchcock were to write murder mysteries  this would be it I give this 5  Train Tickets  Hop aboard and enjoy  One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl       Three for a girl  I m stuck on three  I just can t get any further  My head is thick with sounds  my mouth thick with blood  Three for a girl  I can hear the magpies  they re laughing  mocking me  a raucous cackling  A tiding  Bad tidings  I can see them now  black against the sun  Not the birds  something else  Someone s coming  Someone is speaking to me  Now look  Now look what you made me do  I wanted a new kind of book to read  something that will always keep me reading despite my long pauses  So  I chose this book  Mainly about three women which their destinies meet together though they were apart  A story about how love could take us far  not that pure love  but that cheated sense of desperation to one another A book that shows how love and anger if went out of control  could destroy not just ourselves  but the sense of humanity in our innermost  Terrible things could happen when we cross our limits  lives and the hearts of our beloved ones toward some unstable  temporary and valueless relationships made upon fragile and empty sensations Men and women assuming that love is a soccer game  throwing its ball to one another  will soon perceive how hard and fatal this game is  A game with no winner or loser  a game of chaos  and opaqueness  A game of loss If this book is to be read for a moral  I will summarize it below  Never seek the guidance of anger  to lead your love  to a truth less destiny P S  Some may pointed that this book has a slow pace  But in reality  I find it necessary since the plot is so heavy and fragile at the same time  But the author did an awesome job I even felt so touched at some points  since we were so connected to the characters  This is the best book I ve read in a while  Throughout the story you end up doubting all of the characters at some point  I love how unpredictable it is   It has been a while since I read a book that I felt the need to discuss  I even got my husband interested and kept giving him updates as I proceeded through the book  It was refreshing to have a couple of female characters who were to be both admired and pitied at the same time  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and think that anyone who enjoys a thriller with a few twists and turns will too   What made this story so interesting was definitely the unreliable narrators and the twisted plot  I felt so many emotions while reading this  I went from hating Scott  to liking him  from hating Anne to liking her  from liking Megan to hating her    As frustrating as the main character Rachel was  I always enjoyed reading from her point of view  She could seem a little crazy at times  but I still liked her character overall and I genuinely felt bad for what she had gone through  I sometimes questioned if what she was saying was true  due to her alcohol intake  I wanted so badly for her to remember the events of the night that Megan went missing  and hoped that she wasn t to blame  Paula Hawkins did an incredible job at writing such complex characters  Every single one of them is extremely flawed and difficult to trust Not once did I have the ending figured out  The story flowed quite nicely and every plot twist had me hanging on the edge of my seat  I haven t read a book that had me glued to every page like this since I read Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl  I think I may have been even more captivated by this one  After I read about Megan s disappearance  I couldn t put this book down until I had it all figured out  The Girl on the Train is worth all of it s hype in my opinion  If you re in the mood for a great thriller  be sure to pick this one up  5 out of 5 stars https   readsbymandm wordpress com 20    Loved it  Rachel is my spirit animal trainwreck   This is a great book If you thought GONE GIRL was awesome then you will really dig this I will warn you that it does take place in England so the geography might be unfamiliar  I now wish I knew the London area better You guess  who done it  through most of the book  And just when you have that  aha  moment  it changes like 3 times more The story is told from 3 points of view which made the book flow great and you hardly get bored  It surprised me how much I read yesterday  Time just seems to zoom by as you try to piece the puzzle together Definitely something I would recommend to my mom  a taut book with an unreliable narrator who is a woman  not a girl  Rachel takes the same train into London and back  although home is not an accurate description of her destination she returns to  Rachel was drunk when she had lunch with a client and lost the deal and her job  Now Rachel is living with a woman  Cathy  in a rented room  Cathy who means well  initially does not know Rachel has is unemployed and struggling to remain sane amid her losses  Her husband  Tom  has left her for another woman  Anna  because of her drinking problem  They have a new baby  which is another dismay because Rachel wanted a baby but did not conceive  When drunk Rachel often calls Tom and drives both Tom and Anna crazy On her trips Rachel makes up the story of a man and woman  Jason and Jess  she often sees from the train in the house down the street from Tom and Anna  Megan  the real name of Jess  had an gallery that has closed  Megan has babysat for Tom and Anna  Then Megan  beautiful  but with a secret history  goes missing  Rachel has seen Megan kissing a tall  handsome man and tries to help Scott  Megan s husband  With only a few other auxiliary characters author Paula Hawkins has spun a first rate whodunit   Wow  what a psychological thrill ride this book was   absolutely love the roller coaster ride I just went on reading this book  Such an adventure I had purchased this book and put it on my to read list for this year  to read at some point as I have like hundreds of books I wanted to read first  But a talk show called the Social have a book club and this book was the read for this month  so I wanted to read it so when I watched them review it I would enjoy it more and I m so glad I did  I couldn t put this book down   had to keep reading until I finished it It really makes you think if you really know anyone and that what you perceive to see isn t always what you actually see   blurred perceptions  After reading this book it makes you realize the saying that the grass is greener is definitely not true  The book is told from three points of view   Rachel Watson who is the girl on the train  Anna Watson who is the new wife of Rachel s ex husband and Megan Hipwell a neighbour of Anna s and the woman who Rachel admires every day while on the train  These women  one is an alcoholic  one a liar and cheat and the other is just a selfish bitch for better terms  With characters like these why would you want to read this book well because its just WOW   even with all their flaws its nice reading a book where the characters don t have a perfect life and are perfect  There s so much emotions you feel while reading this book that tug at your heartstrings and it will blow your mind and leave you at the edge of your seat  I don t want to reveal anything as it will ruin the story and the wow factor  but it s a book you have to read if you like a good psycho thriller  God I hope they turn this book into a movie  It was a good book  I liked it a lot  It was a good thriller book for this first time author  I hope she continues writing good books  I don t think it should be placed on the same shelf as Gone Girl  but it is still extremely well written  It catches your attention  You love and hate the characters equally  You want to kill them and help them at the same time  I did not see the end coming until it was there  Very well done  Very worth the read  Pretty impressive for a first effort  Clever plotting  Weird people  But the good   Win in the end  The Girl on the Train was riveting  I could not predict where this story was going  The main character  Rachel  had more than a few flaws  a drinking problem that was out of control and a seeming inability to tell the truth  Floating helplessly through life  she yearned for an earlier time when she was married  Would her husband return to her  How could she make it happen  Along with these struggles  she often vicariously observed the lives of others while riding the train through her old neighborhood  She saw something that perplexed her  But did she really see what she thought she saw  The unfolding story of Rachel will keep you hooked in to this story until it s unexpected conclusion  Loved it  I enjoyed the unexpected twists and turns in this book  Very fast paced  it s quite easy to get into the story  Characters are all pretty screwed up in their own ways so at first you may not know who the villain may be  Not much character development  but this is not that kind of book  I do recommend for murder mystery lovers and those who prefer fast paced books  An absolute page turner  This book sucked me in right away   It must be horrible for all the bright people out there to read a book like this and know the ending before they get there  Me  I m not so bright  which is ok as I can immerse myself in a great book like this   not have a clue what is going on until the big reveal  Life is good  Read it before the film comes out  Yes  I loved it  Listened to the audiobook and it was so engaging I would stay in my car to finish a chapter no matter how long it took  The readers are great and I thought really made you feel for the characters  That said  like Gone Girl  I hated everyone in this book  People making horrible choices even if the intention was good  It was twisted and wonderful and  I loved the premise of it  I ride the metro sometimes to Pasadena and I would wonder what was happening in some of the homes along the line  It was just wonderfully written  fast paced and an excellent read  I was thinking that some of my older ya readers would really enjoy this book  I think if they liked Stephanie Kuehn or Chris Crutcher this would be a good one to suggest   I read this so fast  I startled myself  I had to keep going and I didn t figure who had done it until just before the author gave it away  Rachel is  the girl on the train  who pretends to her friend flatmate landlady Cathy that she still has a job when in fact she had been fired months earlier for costing her company an important client while drunk  She broke up her own marriage to Tom over her alcoholism  Now she rides the train to and from London as she always did  pretending she still had a job so Cathy wouldn t suspect It is while she rides this train that she always looks to her old house where her husband  who cheated on her with a slut named Anna  still lives  having married Anna and having had a baby girl Evie with her  Rachel is just a pathetic loser and really  Anna is the same insecure type creature  On the street where she lived  Rachel has created a fantasy life of a perfect marriage for Scott and Megan  a couple she spies on as the train passes  Soon though she is drawn into a nightmare  she has kept drunkenly pursuing Tom and Anna and now that neighbor of theirs  Megan has gone missing  She involves herself in the case and the killer is willing to kill anyone who gets too close to solving Megan s murder  Who could the killer be  jealous husband Scott who found out Megan was having affairs  Anna  afraid of losing Tom to Megan  Tom  was he sleeping with Megan  The exotic psychiatrist Megan was seeing  and sleeping with   Or could it even be Rachel herself since she was there that night  drunk and furious at Megan for kissing the doctor in her front yard  she had this sick and elaborate fantasy going about Megan and Scott and was angry at the cheating  who wound up at home with blood all over her and a blacked out memory of what she had seen and done that night  I enjoyed this mystery a lot  Hallmarks of a killer thriller from one reader s perspective   Book Riot Challenge  2015  Guilty Pleasure Category   Thrillers 1  There s speed in the read  Mini cliff hangers throughout the book compel a reader to turn the page  2  Characters develop across time and their complex traits are revealed through their actions  It s all about   Show the reader  don t tell   First rate dialogue matches the character and their traits  The dialogue is believable to a reader  Would this person say that  3  There is a sense of disquiet and apprehension that contribute to the reader s desire to keep moving through text   This is creepy  but I just have to know   4  Settings  descriptions deliver a sense of foreboding  rain  heat  claustrophobic space   All of these descriptions ratchet up the feeling of tension 5  Elements of surprise keep a reader off balance and interested  Predictable events and character cliche would not be welcome in a psychological thriller  Bull s eye  Ms  Hawkins  This reader thinks you hit the mark on a debut thriller  I can see this one headed to film  Thanks for the wild ride  I can t recall ever reading such a captivating book  I couldn t wait to get to the next chapter and the next  Paula Hawkins is a masterful writer  Her prose just flows without any bumps or hiccups   I loved this book  It was suspenseful and hard to put down  I highly recommend it   Good read  Can t wait to see it on the big screen   Loved this a lot better than Gone Girl  I LOVED this book  The story rattled along like an express   what a ride  I loved how all the strands of the story were interwoven like hair in a tight plait  and each time it was a surprise to learn how close they all were  I thought the character development of Rachel   the main narrator   was excellent  She is unreliable but there is a reason for that and it is not all down to her  Some reviewers say she is unlikable but I liked her and felt sorry for her  Because of the multiple narrators it is tricky to guess who dun it  and I had everyone in the frame at some point which made it exciting  I recommend this book  Amazing  Can not put this one down   Really good  Extremely entertaining  read in a cross country flight   Rachel sits on the train  making up stories about the  perfect couple  she sees at one house every day  Only as time goes on do you realize that Rachel is just as obsessed about her ex and his new wife  a few doors down  And Rachel may be a somewhat unreliable narrator  Then the wife of the  perfect couple  disappears  A well plotted  well told story  The weakest part was not liking the characters  but there is such a great explanation for at least one of the things that I gave the author extra kudos at the end for that   This thriller reads like a screenplay   and I d like to watch it  After reading this novel  I have no choice but to leave a stellar review  My mom recommended this book   The Girl on the Train  by Paula Hawkins  with high praise  I agree with every word she said  I was skeptical first  as a result of the confusion from reading three points of views at once  The trick to reading this novel  as I can fully suggest  is that you have to stick with it throughout the first few chapters  Once you know what is going on  it will be well worth the initial baffling feelings you may have reading throughout the mystery  It is important to keep in mind that the entire point of the novel is for the reader to not know everything that is happening  otherwise it would not be a mystery  Hawkins does a wonderful job with balancing out three points of views  giving just enough detail to hook the reader yet leaving out just enough to leave them wanting more  The characters  while at first some may be hateful  are quite lovable in the end with a series of plot twists and unexpected reveals about each  The novel also delves into the psychological realm of each aspect of the mystery  This serves to be very purposeful in the analyzation of the plot and motivation behind the crime which was committed  by of course  an unexpected character  I don t want to post about any spoilers  because it would ruin the book  but instead I will talk about the symbolization in the novel  The foreshadowing used in the beginning of the book was so important  yet it could be missed at a first read over  I had read this book twice before fully grasping each symbol and deeper meaning to them  as well as catch the hidden foreshadowing  Hawkins did such a sly and clever job at flawlessly leading the reader on down each falsely paved path  yet guiding them to the correct destination at the end every time   I highly recommend this  The comparisons with Gone Girl are obvious i e  similar pacy writing style  multiple narrators  mystery to work out etc  I didn t rate Gone Girl very highly though so was unsure whether I d enjoy The Girl on the Train  It had been at the top of the Kindle most popular charts for months and when it finally came down in price to a couple of pounds I thought I might as well  since there are a lot of good reviews on here  I agree with others that it is basically a better  British  Gone Girl  One of my main reasons for not liking GG is that the characters and scenario felt so unbelievable  The 3 narrators here  particularly Rachel the Girl from the title  felt a lot more realistic  The way she spoke about her alcoholism  struggle to conceive  and her overall bitterness at her relationship ending in infidelity was all so convincing and  yes  real  When Rachel talked about being replaced by another woman  Anna   this stood out    She must be very secure in herself  I suppose  in them  for it not to bother her  to walk where another woman has walked before  She obviously doesn t think of me as a threat  I think about Ted Hughes  moving Assia Wevill into the home he d shared with Plath  of her wearing Sylvia s clothes  brushing her hair with the same brush  I want to ring Anna up and remind her that Assia ended up with her head in the oven  just like Sylvia did    The quality of writing was excellent throughout and the 3 women all had distinct  voices   Although the pace slowed slightly at a couple of points  for the most part I was gripped and didn t want to stop reading  The denouement might be disappointing for some as it could possibly be guessed  but I still think it came together in a way that was much more believable than Gone Girl  It really was a fantastic read that I got through in a few hours  I think it will be very difficult for author Paula Hawkins to follow this   her first novel   as it was so good  but I ll certainly be keeping an eye out for anything else she comes up with    There s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home  So thinks Rachel  a troubled divorced alcoholic who takes the train to London every day  Recently unemployed  she is commuting in to the city to avoid telling her landlord that she lost her job  Rachel loves the train rides  and always keeps an eye out for one particular house along the tracks  She has constructed a story of the couple who reside there  Jason and Jess  and likes to think of them as the perfect couple with the perfect life that she herself once aspired to  But when Jess goes missing  Rachel suddenly finds herself involved in a criminal investigation This debut novel  a fast paced thriller in the same vein as Gone Girl  is a great summer beach read because it keeps you guessing  A real page turner  featuring three deeply flawed and unreliable narrators  this book touches on alcoholism  marriage  infidelity  infertility  motherhood  and of course  murder It seems like everyone has a secret  and the reader is kept in the dark and must determine which narrator can be trusted  The author has created a clever story with the intrigue of an excellent psychological mystery  Interesting to note that  The Girl on the Train  is the fastest selling adult novel in history having sold more than two million copies in the U S  alone since it was published in early 2015  The book has already been optioned for a movie  On the edge of my seat  So interesting  amazingly suspenseful  Fantastic book  Read it so fast  Better than Gone Girl  Read This Book I read the Sample of this book and thought maybe  maybe not  Then my daughter recommended it  so I started it again  At first I was a bit put off by Rachel and her drinking but then it started to become a very important part of the story and I stopped thinking of all the people in my life she reminded me of and started getting caught up in the twists and turns Author Hawkins was leading me through and found myself anxious to get through each chapter and onto the next piece of the puzzle  A few reviewers have compared The Girl on the Train to a Hitchcock Thriller and I wholeheartedly agree  Not sure how good a movie this would make but I am sure that it is a Great Read  Start it as soon as you can and be prepared to not want to do anything else until you finish  This novel was simply amazing and so wonderful to read  The author did a great job with the Rachel and the plot  I ve never been more frustrated and annoyed at a character in my life  Rachel just couldn t get it right  She just kept fucking up  I wanted to take the drink right from her hand and down it for myself  then slap some sense in to her  She redeemed herself in the end  And Anna blew my mind  in a weirdly pleasant way  by the end The ending left me quite shaken  So much so that I fell and took a tumble down the street when I went to walk my dog after  There s blood on my hands and cuts on my knees  I m still quivering  The Girl on the Train is a read in one sitting thriller from the perspectives of three women in each others  orbits  They re all flawed to unlikeable  but somehow still sympathetic  which is a nice balancing act and the result of some skillful writing  Overall  the whole book is successful on so many levels  from being an enticing character study  to a fast paced  compelling mystery Have you seen that Donald Glover sketch about crazy women stories vs crazy man stories  If you haven t  I recommend you watch it  but if you can t  here s the money quote  I realized like   every man  every man in this room has a crazy woman story  you know  Like every man in here is just like   Oh  remember Christine  Christine was crazy  Christine was so crazy  Remember when I had my new girl and Christine comes up like   Where that bitch at    And I was like   Christine  what s goin  on  I got my new girl  get out of here   Christine was crazy  right  Christine was crazy  Aww   memories You know  and every dude in here has that story  And I was like  why don t women have crazy men stories  Why don t women have crazy men stories  I don t really hear them  And then I realized and I was like  OH  It s because if you have a crazy boyfriend   you gon  die  And that more or less describes this book  Every one of the three female protagonists is the type that some guy  somewhere    probably many guys    would call a  crazy bitch   for various reasons  And they re all varying levels of  crazy   but if you re a woman you know  all it takes is one tic  one anxiety  one less than serene behavior  and that s all you need for some guys  and women   out there to take you less than seriously  And worse  the  crazier  you are  the easier it is for an even crazier man to get away with manipulation  abuse  and murder  This book is fiction  hyperbole  but it s also truth First  we meet Rachel  She s a depressed alcoholic who is still hung up on her ex husband  and she rides the same train every day from her home to a job in London that she was fired from months before  just so that she can ride by her old house that she shared with him  Reading her earliest chapters is an ongoing exercise in fremdschamen  with every drink  and every  good idea   you re shouting at her   Rachel  NO   It s one of these  good ideas  that gets her wrapped up in the disappearance of Megan Hipwell  a woman who lives down the street from Rachel s old house with her husband  Scott Hipwell  Before her disappearance  though  Rachel had also been watching Megan and Scott from the train    calling them Jess and Jason    and fantasizing about what appeared to be their perfect marriage  It s this obsession with them  as well as a coincidental proximity to the neighborhood around the time that Megan goes missing  that causes Rachel to involve herself  thinking she can help Then  we get into Megan s mind  first in chapters that begin approximately a year or so before Rachel s chapters and the disappearance  Though not formally diagnosed  Megan is probably something of a manic depressive  A former addict with a few darker demons  Megan is mostly happy with Scott  but nonetheless begins to feel stifled over time by his love  The more overbearing he seems to her  the more she tries to draw away  and the harder he tries to bring her back in  She self medicates with infidelity  some of which Scott is aware of  and that doesn t help his hovering  as he s constantly wondering if Megan is distant because she s having an affair  or if she s just withdrawn  Reading these chapters sets up the context to her eventual disappearance and paints a stark contrast to the perfect woman painting Rachel initially creates of her Finally  we meet Anna  She s the current wife of Rachel s ex husband  Tom  You re mostly sympathetic to her  because you already know that Rachel hangs around  calls and emails Tom all the time  and is generally still a semi threatening presence that the family can t seem to shake  Still  the other thing you know about Anna is that she was the  other woman  when Tom began cheating on Rachel  Until you read her perspective  your feelings about her are entirely formed by your personal feelings about  the other woman   but at the very least  you understand why Rachel resents her  if not why Rachel still stalks her family  To say too much more is potentially giving clues away  There is an argument to be made for all of these people and more  at some point  to be responsible for Megan s disappearance  and the story skillfully unravels what happened while exploring the dark psychology of failed  and doomed  relationships and the emotional toll they take   lost myself in the pages  spent a well deserved sunburnt afternoon on the beach  and finished the book within the day  success  If people say that all the characters in this book are a train wreck  they definitely aren t lying  And  truthfully  that s probably why I liked it so much and yet hated it so much  I can t give it less than 5 stars though simply because I really did want to know what happened next through the entire story  I probably could have read this in one sitting if it hadn t been for real life getting in the way  Each of the POV characters were just as lost and confused as the next one  It was something that was very interesting to me The entire time I was reading I couldn t help but feel like most of the characters were people that I could have encountered on the street  I wanted to be the girl on the train fantasizing about the lives of the people who lived in the houses that I passed  For Rachel  though  she actually got to know them in ways that she probably never expected for all the wrong reasons  It s fast paced and gives a sort of insight into abusive relationships and alcoholism that was way more real than I expected it to be  I bought this book because I kept hearing about it everywhere and I have to agree  It is amazing   1  The arrangement is fascinating  At the end  it is actually quite a simple story  What makes a story fascinating is not the the story  but the order arrangement way the author tells it  All the three girls take turns to narrate  It helps readers to see the difference from eyes of different people can be quite different  isn t it 2 You don t have to like the characters  the author only writes the dark side of people All of them are train wrecks and totally messed up  none of them are lovable characters  At the beginning  I feel very uncomfortable and I would rather not know about those messed up lives When I read half through the book  I get the feeling that maybe the author just writes about the dark side of human nature At the end  I realize that all these messed up lives got an explanations    The more Rachel messed up   view spoiler  the more horrible Tom lied and manipulated her  view spoiler  3 Vivid descriptions of alcoholicsThe way Rachel thinks and hides the liquors in milk box    and finding comforts from drinking  what makes people start to drink  both Rachel and Anna makes me wonder whether the author is also an alcoholic 4 Jess   JasonP86 I realize that perhaps  after all  she isn t so different from me P224 But it goes to show  doesn t it  that you think you know someone and then   P319 I have the clearest memory of Scott talking about Megan  saying I don t even know who she was Nobody s life is as perfect as we imagine  People believe what they wanna believe 5 Three different attitudes towards babies Rathel wants baby so bad  and invest tons of money in xxx several times and became an alcoholic out of it Magen P19 He thinks spending time around babies will make me broody In fact it s doing exactly the opposite  when I leave their house I run home  can t wait to strip my clothes off and get into the shower and wash the baby smell off me Anna P232 I keep telling myself this while I m trying to get egg yolk out of my hair  while I m crawling around on the floor picking up spoons and upturned bowls  I keep telling my self this is normal Still  when we were finally done and she was playing happily by herself I let myself cry for a minute 6 Weakness   ManipulationP314 This is what he does this is what he always does He s a master at it   making me fell as though everything is my fault  making me feel worthless The more miserable Rachel is  the more manipulated Tom has been He mamaneged to make Rachel believe that it was her hurt herself and he was the one helping her   hide spoiler    hide spoiler   awesome  gripping  better than Gone Girl  Please do yourself the favor and read this book  1 This was a quick   could not put out down  read  Excellent  decadent read  It was like looking through a window into the lives of these people who had lots of little secrets  Great for a quick  captivating read  I read this in one day and don t usually get into thrillers  but the suspense was really well done and well paced and I definitely could feel my pulse going off at the end  Really quite brilliant  I listened to the audio and the narrators were awesome  When you want to read some book  you almost always search for a gripping  interesting storyline and characters  When I started to read this book  I was a bit disappointed at first because I had read the reviews about it before so I had very high expectations in the beginning  but the first  80 pages deceived me  It wasn t very gripping and attention catching  It was just a story about a weird woman who went on the train to London and imagined lives of the people who lived by the train tracks  But it was just the beginning  After the  not to say boring  but not very gripping part  came very very interesting storyline with many plot twists especially when it came to the very end  It became so thrilling I couldn t put the book away  The characters became very easy to identify with and I was really captivated  All the plot twists were so unpredictable and I just couldn t believe it was really going to end like that  I highly recommend this book to everyone who wants to enjoy a very good book  This is  in my opinion  one of the best psycological thrillers and I think every fan of detective novels will be astounded by this book  Fast paced  Well written  Really got into it and had to know who did it  They are all awful people   I loved how this dark story became clearer and clearer a little bit at a time  I enjoyed trying to figure out what happened and where it was going  Increible  Magistral  En cuanto cogi este libro  supe que me iba a encantar  Me engancho muchisimo desde la primera pagina  y es que esto era todo lo que necesitaba despues de esta sequia literaria de tantos meses  un libro asi era todo lo que necesitaba  un libro tan fresco  que presenta otro tipo de historia  otro tipo de personajes  otro tipo de narracion  ya que esta contado desde los diferentes puntos de vista de las tres protagonistas     Un libro diferente  que no fuese lo tipico de lo que ya estoy harta Cada pagina es mas increible que la anterior  Nunca sabes lo que te vas a encontrar en la siguiente hoja  pero sabes que va a ser sorprendente y totalmente inesperado  En cuanto al final  que es lo que ultimamente no solia convencerme del todo en los libros   magnifico  Es cierto que ya  de algun modo  te lo esperas  ya que poco a poco lo van dejando caer a medida que avanzan las paginas  esa es la unica   pega   que le pongo  que al fin y al cabo no es una pega  ya que es algo inevitable Se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo  Fantastico  excellent Imagine that your life is a total mess  You are depressed and you are alone  The only thing that entertains you is that couple who you see in your train window every single day  passing by their house  You know them so well  They are happy  They are in love  Until one of them is missing and you are the only one who saw IT You saw IT  but of course no one will believe you  Why  Because you are a filthy  stinking alcoholic  an ex wife who got fat  an ex who can t move on  a desperate worthless someone  They all think that s what you are  Not to forget the blackouts during which you ve done horrible things in the past  and which things you couldn t remember the morning after that  And one of this blackouts happened just on the night of the disappearence  You know one thing  You were on that street  and you saw SOMETHING  But can you trust yourself  And if not  tha who could you trust  There is them  The man who broke your heart and his new wife  the woman who stole your dreams  And they are the neighbours of the missing woman  Did they saw anything  Were they involved  Her husband who lost all of his hope  Who is the main suspect  You like him a lot  He s just like you  Broken and abandoned  He understands you  And he can t be the murdereer  You know him  They don t  You saw the real him  Did you really And there is B  The one who was kept in secret  The one who denies the obvious  the only one about whom you know that he is one 100 percent lying  The thing is  how do you prove it  Why are you so sure that you aren t the one who did it  You want to solve this mystery  You want to remember  You want to know the truth  Although be careful  because EVERYONE IS LYING and you won t expect this kind of truth   I would like to begin by saying that I recommended this book to a lot of people and even neglected by monthly book club read for this This is dark  Like  it s going to make you think real hard about  things  in general  For instance  I spent one night  probably more than that  just sitting there and thinking about my own life  Which I think most people do  but this was serious  this was dark Our main character is someone that you will want to save  You will want to reach into that book and pull her up  brush her off  and take her to an AA meeting  While I felt at times that I just wanted to shake her for my frustration with her memory and with her addiction  I changed my tune Our character rides the trains  drunk or sober  she rides the trains  Through the windows she create a new life  actively imagining how her previous neighbors lived and becoming jealous of the rich fantasy that she created in her head  By and by through a drunken night and this active fantasy   she finds herself in not only in danger  but pulling on a continuous rope trying to find those lost memories from one night as well as what went wrong with her marriage As a reader  I used to become so annoyed with novels that told the story through multiple perspectives of the characters involved  But as I ve gotten older  I have grown more appreciative of this and enjoyed reading and understanding the other characters through this form of writing  I have become more appreciative of how straining this is on a writing and how it helps them develop their story The author does a wonderful job of  feeling  for the main character  She is an alcoholic  depressed  divorced  unemployed  and on the cusp of being homeless  Her world was shattered when her husband left her for someone and then    of course    had a child with the other woman  Her rich fantasy life keeps replaying this in her head  reminding her of a time when she was happy   or at least not alone  But this story tells more than just a cheating husband who finds happiness with someone else  Much  much more  Amazing audiobook  A little hard to get into with the three  unreliable  narrators  but each one is fantastic  Made the three women so believable that I completely bought the story  This is a book that grips you from the start  I couldn t put it down so I ended up reading it a single day  In my own categories  I would classify this as a psychological thriller  Obsession  deceit  and repressed memories    All things that work to send Rachel down the road towards self distruction  However  when she needs answers  she s like a dog with a bone  She can t avoid putting herself into awkward situations as well as putting herself in harm s way as she tries to come to terms with her broken marriage  while  at the same time  trying to help the husband of a missing woman whose supposedly perfect life she would fantasize whenever she travelled by their home  located along the tracks  on her daily trains travels  It s not very often that I find a book that I can devour in one sitting  but this one had me hooked  I kept hearing incredible things about it  and over a long weekend  I finally got around to reading it The story is told from the perspective of three women who are central to the plot  The first person we meet is Rachel   an infuriating alcoholic who deserves a good shaking  She s selfish  unemployed  drinks a wee bit much and constantly blacks out  and is just so annoyingly unreliable  Her stalker behaviour would drive anyone nuts  You think she s lost it right at the beginning  as she takes the train into work everyday from Ashbury to Euston  pretty certain that would drain her bank account   Through her  we meet both Anna and Megan  who infuriate you even more  But that s the best part   what makes this book a masterpiece is the way the author has painted these flawed characters  You want to keep reading and find out which one of them is the worst out of all of them There are plenty of comparisons online to Gone Girl  Whilst the characters will probably remind you of Nick and Amy in parts  I can t see much of a similarity   except that they re both psychological thrillers  I also think that Gone Girl has more of a  surprise  element to it But chances are that you ll like this one if you re a fan of Gillian Flynn s book  I recommend adding this to your reading list  Clearly  the combination of public drunkenness  infidelity  murder  and lies are a pretty good combo  Dark  Gripping  Haunting   Captivating  I Loved It    This book was fantastic  It s one of those books that you wanted to talk about so badly the whole time I was reading it and then the minute I finished I needed to talk to anyone I knew who had read the book  Hawkins does an amazing job of slowly revealing evidence  by switching narrators and through flashbacks  so by the time the answers are revealed the reader has all the pieces  Because of this I felt like the ending was very well thought out and intentional  which tends to be my biggest complaint in murder mysteries  Often times I feel like authors want so badly to shock us they don t develop the evidence throughout the course of the story  Hawkins ins t trying for pure shock value  I truly felt like she wanted the readers to play detective and figure it out as they went  None of the characters can be trusted and everyone is a suspect  I ve heard critics of the book say this made the characters unlikable and there was no one worth rooting for  First  I don t think we need to like the characters to like the story and second  I don t think it s true  At the beginning of the book Rachel  the protagonist  presents the reader with the idea that everyone is broken  As we chip away at each character s exterior we realize this to be true  Every character in the story is flawed  just like people in real life  I felt like aside from the murder mystery this was one of the major themes of the novel and it develops so beautifully as we get to know each of the characters better  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery and anyone who likes digging for clues and putting the pieces all together   Wow wow wow      Didn t see that ending  So much better than Gone Girl   I am not one who reads books from the thriller genre  However  on a visit to the local bookshop  I was drawn in by the cover of the book  The blurred title of this  what I can only describe as irresistible read  drew me in  I started reading this book late night and landed up having lack of sleep as I could not simply call it a night until my eyes literally shut close from exhaustion  This book was so unpredictable and compulsive that I just wanted to read until there wasn t anything left to read  The characters are fantastic  I cannot praise these characters enough  I was entirely hooked on their words  I loved the style of writing used as it just placed you in the minds of these characters  I felt like I knew Rachel and Megan as though they were people I have met rather than characters in a book  The story itself is enthralling  It literally kept me up most of the night trying to piece together different clues and and information to form an accurate theory before the real truth was revealed  I must admit  I was pretty close as to my theory of who did what  but it was not without overthinking every detail on every page  Even then I could not help but be shocked by the actual ending of the story  This is nothing short of excellent  As I said  I am not a person who reads thrillers  but if this is anything to go by  I will be adding some more thrillers to my book shelf   Great read  It kept me guessing the whole time   To paraphrase one of my favorite childhood books    I think I can  I think I can  I think I can     say this book took me on quite a train ride   I am pleased to say that I deduced  who done it  early on in the read  but even given that  I was in it to the very end  Me ENCANTOOO dios es demasiado bueno y no paras de leerlo aunque las primeras 40 paginas son un poco lentas la autora supo como amarrarte a seguir leyendo hasta el final  Definitivamente le doy 5 estrellas  Es un excelente libro se los recomiendo a todos This is an excellent book  as intriguing as Gone Girl but with a good ending  which Gone Girl lacked in my view   The Girl on the Train is very original with the main character battling alcoholism and set back by severe blackouts  I can t go into detail about any small quibbles there without spoiling surprises  but  frankly  my few moments of incredulity didn t dampen my enthusiasm for the book as a whole  I highly recommend this novel as an very imaginative story that kept me enthralled from beginning to end  It was fun to be tricked  too  although I hate to admit it   This book is truly amazing  I loved it  It is fascinating thrilling  beyond suspenseful  character driven and very entertaining  It s the kind of book that really is impossible to put down after a certain point  Definitely not your typical mystery novel  Those who compare the book to  Gone Girl  and call it Hitchcockian are absolutely right  I urge all fiction fans to read it not just those who like mysteries  as it is so much more than a mystery   Devoured it  Gave it my sister  She devoured it  I loved how much empathy I felt for such a flawed narrator   This is a psychological thriller which reminded me of Gone Girl in the fact someone had been murdered and none of the characters are particularly likeable  This is where the similarities end though  Even though none of the characters are likeable  they are understandable in their bad choices  The Girl On The Train is Rachel  a recently divorced woman who is also an alcoholic and her life is in tatters  The train journey she takes into London each day also take her past the back of her old house  where her ex and his new family now live  Though she watches this house from the train window  she also watches that of her old neighbours  Scott and Megan  One day Megan goes missing  and Rachel thinks she has seen something that can help  but her memories are clouded from the amount of alcohol she drinks  What starts as a bit of nosiness  draws her into the murder of her ex neighbour and she learns that everyone has secrets and lives are never as perfect as they might appear on the surface This was a definite page turner for me  I could relate to the characters  even their bad points  and I felt for them  which always makes a good book for me  It when I don t care about the characters that I stop reading  This is a must read for all fans of the genre  This book is absolutely riveting  I couldn t put it down  Fun I thought this book was great  A fun read   it was hard to follow in the beginning but was much easier to follow as I continued to read  I highly recommend reading this         Adorei  Nao se tornou um dos meus livros favoritos  e certo  mas prendeu me e entusiasmou me  Dava por mim a pensar no que teria acontecido  A querer ter pausas no trabalho para ler um pouco mais Inicialmente  andei um pouco perdida  confesso  Gosto de policiais  do misterio  da curiosidade em saber quem fez o que e porque  Neste livro  estas duvidas surgem mais tarde  mas quando isso acontece     Rachel  who is a bit like me  and I couldn t help but almost become Rachel in this brilliant little riveting story  is divorced  has lost her job  is undisciplined  gaining weight and has a definite drinking problem  But she means well and is determined to quit drinking  to get a new job and to move on from her divorce  And yet  she can t quite do any of the things necessary to get her life back together  She spies on her ex and his beautiful new wife and kid  she gets up every morning and takes the train to London  pretending she s still employed and in the meantime  she watches people from the train  especially one couple who seem to have the life she has always wanted  real love  a new child  they are both attractive and loving to each other  and yet    Some of the things I think make this book an outstanding read 1  Brilliant authors seem to understand and convey human emotions and psychology in a story  We re used to the protagonist being some kind of outstanding or heroic individual and then cheering him or her on as they make it through the many obstacles  In this story  Rachel is rather average and her life has fallen apart and yet somehow  she becomes a sympathetic character that I cared deeply for even though almost every step of the way  she is messing up  looks bad  dwells on the past  is awkwardly drunk over and over again  tells a lot of white lies and tries to cover up her miserable existence  It s heartbreaking  perhaps like having a kid or a brother or sister who is just a screw up but you can never give up on them because there always seems to be a chance that they will do better  change  2  It delves well into relationships and control issues and how hard life really is sometimes  And how immature people do immature things  How men and women fight and are always seeking love and companionship and how tough that seems to achieve  None of the main characters are really what they appear to be on the surface  Some are liars  some are cheaters  some are conmen and women  and all disappointingly selfish and wounded  And sometimes  things move to a terrifying and horrible level  Maybe our average failure of a gal is really the best of the lot 3  The story moves along at a good pace and the actions of the main characters come together well  the story unfolding gradually and believably and there s no predictable ending  I was worried and nervous right to the very end  4  For me  if after the end of the book I still want to hear more about the main characters  wondering if maybe there will be a sequel  in this case I doubt it   if I want to help them  check in on them  the book is a success  It is absolutely the case here I highly recommend this one   Ok it s time to be quizzical  I have started this review before completely finishing this book  although I am near the end  I will have finished the book by the time I m done with this review  I m sympathetic to Rachel  Who wouldn t be  I also just want her really badly to not be the killer I also don t want her to be killed by Scott if he is the killer or if there is a series of very extreme turns near the end I think it s also possible that her ex husband could be the killer seeing as how Megan had many lovers  I m completely engrossed at this point and I feel like I ve very clearly thought this out that the ending is going to be one of these possibilities  1 Rachel herself killed Megan by mistake in a drunken stupor  2 Scott her husband killed her and will also kill Rachel 3  Rachel s ex husband Tom killed Megan  and was also secretly romantic with her  4  the lover therapist killed her  5 the drunk red haired man from the train is a serial killer and killed Megan and will also kill Rachel  I think the story is going to end with most likely number 1 possibly 3  Those seem like the most unpredictable of endings  Reading throughout this story I don t like the character Anna because she is a homewrecker  I can t help but be suspicious of her too like she is involved some how  I like Rachel but I don t like her roommate to much  I don t like how Rachel is so obsessed with her ex and I wish she would be a stronger woman and move on  I especially didn t like how near the end Tom jealously confronts Rachel about her seeing Scott and she feels guilty  At that point I want to smack her around  I love the story thus far and am now going to finish the end to see how far off bass I am Now that I ve finished I was surprised and also not surprised at the same time  It was a great story and I can see how it won the best Goodreads thriller of the year  Also I do like trains   Loved this book  I did the audiobook with three different narrators and thought it was amazing  The author does a great job of building the case against multiple suspects at the same time so you are kept guessing until the big reveal  It is also adept at addressing  minor thematic spoilers  infidelity and loss and addiction and domestic violence  It s a tight cast and three different narrators  so it might seem ponderous  but the mystery is unwrapped between the perspectives so nicely  Great pacing  Fun read  It makes you feeling edgy   gets you addicted from the beginning with being emotional and dark  With the touch of a bit of psychoanalysis and turning the suspense up with a chapter for each character   It s the perfect mix of Moriaty   Flynn  That disturbing  fuckedupness Hope that the movie will be as good as the book not done in haste like gone girl Read it in a total of 5 hours I think  I could not stop reading  Finished it in 2 days  The story is divided in short chapters which alternately tells the story of Megan and Rachel  I think this is one of the reasons why this book was so easy to read  Fast pace  lots of twists and turns  absolutely loved it  Everytime I thought I figured out who did it  something in the story pushes me in another direction  This is definitely a must read  especially for thriller fans  Do not skip this book  I will keep an eye on Paula Hawkins  because if this is a hint of more to come    I will always be satisfied     Total guilty pleasure  The perfect page turner for a rainy January day  The girl on a trainAn alcoholic fantasist with a failed marriage  a lost career and a hopeless future is odd type casting for a main character  The daily routine of commuting  ordinary people living ordinary lives in the suburbs  the dullness of working for a living in a city of millions is not a glittering locus in quo for a psychological thriller  People not being exactly as they portray themselves is nothing unusual  The author takes these mundane facets of life  creates ever evolving characters  could be you  your mate  your aunt      and weaves a simple but perplexing tale that draws you in and makes you revise your understanding of the plot almost chapter by chapter  The tension is quietly palpable leading to an eye opening finale  Excellent  The very ordinariness of it adds to the tension  A wordsmith of note  I will read more by this author  Amazing  fast paced  so many twists and turns  Difficult to put down  After the phenomenon of Gone Girl  the unreliable narrator trope has become all the rage  Of course we all know there are legendary characters throughout literary history who are famously  unreliable   but never has the trend been so prevalent  The narrators in this grim novel are all untrustworthy  The main  voice  of Rachel was particularly difficult to labor through  Her broken down  alcoholic  complete mess of a life was harrowing  I hated her and felt sorry for her  Anyone who has struggled with alcoholism will feel that familiar hangover  that poisonous rotten taste that lingers on the breath and the deathly fear of the blackout s many secrets  It was hard for me at times to tolerate her weakness  The pain of a philandering husband is something many of us are well acquainted with but I found myself disgusted by her collapse of character but then that is the point  The other two narrators are equally as stomach churning  Women without backbones  Women without strength  Women who hated themselves and used men to fill that void  And also that predatory evil that can only reside within a woman s insecurities  The plot is riveting and compulsive  I was pulled in and then got lost in this triumvirate of pain and horror  The twists and turns of a missing woman and the affect it has on everyone in the story  I figured out the mystery rather early on but that didn t stop me from spending hours ravenously turning pages to get to the end  Like Gone Girl  it made me feel that the true nature of what women are capable of had been revealed  We are complicated creatures who grow weary with the predictability of the opposite sex  It is an engaging read and left me feeling a bit lost and alone as a woman on the other side of a failed marriage but with the flicker of hope that the rawness of womanhood is being unleashed by these captivating women writers  Bravo  Ever sat on a train or bus  looking out of the window and imagining what s going on in those houses  I m a bit like this  Sometimes I stop and wonder what all those people around me are up to  They all have a life as complex as mine  and for them I m just an extra in a movie  instantly forgotten  This is where this book starts   I watch the people I pass   the two men running  backpacks on  training for the marathon  the young woman in a black skirt and white trainers  heels in her bag  on her way to work   and I wonder what they re hiding  Are they moving to stop drinking  running to stand still   I enjoyed it immensely  It s a clever written thriller that is very fast paced but doesn t leave character building behind  There are different viewpoints from 3 main characters which are perfectly spaced  giving you just enough information to keep you guessing People keep drawing comparisons to Gone Girl  but I don t think that gives Paula Hawkins s work justice  While Gone Girl has loosely a similar tone and story  The Girl on the Train is a different kind of beast  Yes there are twists that I didn t saw coming  but it s less of a heavy character study and more a realistic chain of events where bad things happen to good  or are they   people And this is why this book gets 5 stars from me  It s realistic  So realistic that it s scary  The Girl on the Train must be the first thriller I ve read  where every action from every character just made sense  Everything done and said happened exactly like I thought it should  And not needing to shout at the characters for their foolishness  was a nice change   WOW  This book is so good  I got into all the characters really fast  It is great writing and the twists in the story are very good with a fantastic ending  I LOVED IT  Once I got into this  it was hard to put down  It will be hard to find a better book than this one  Gerard s review  It has been compared to Gone Girl  but I liked this a lot better  I am still trying to figure out why  Maybe because these characters were more real  and struggling with real problems  then the whacked out  amazing Amy  of Gone Girl  I think the background story in the beginning was enough to get you interested without being too drawn out  I liked the way the background continued to be filled in right to the end to round out the motivations of the characters  This was a very well written mystery with a vivid cast of characters  including an unreliable drunk as the amateur sleuth  Frankly  I loved it  The characters were thoroughly messed up and complex  the use of unreliable narration was well handled  the mystery was compelling enough to keep my attention  and the unusual structure appealed to me  The novel is basically written as a series of monologues by the three main female characters  so that it almost feels like you re reading their diary entries  and the chapters are divided into morning and evening sections to mimic the average commuting schedule of the train that plays such an important role in the story  Mostly  though  I can t stress enough how great the character work is  These people are royally screwed up  and some of them turn out to be truly awful people even when you feel bad for them  but they are believably complicated and their faults remain relatable   Not counting the killer s  of course   I guessed whodunit long before the end  but I don t blame the author for that  I ve read  studied  and written enough mysteries myself to recognize the tricks Hawkins employs  Ultimately  this novel reminded me of GONE GIRL and DARE ME in the best ways  Highly recommended for readers who like mysteries  thrillers  and incredibly well drawn character studies  I liked it  It was hard to put down  I was so happy I picked this book up  especially since it has been a bestseller  I am usually not into these types of books  I actually found most of it really depressing and even a little paranoid  BUT after reading the entire thing  it was incredible  I simply could not put it down  literally stayed up until 2 AM finishing it  It was a quick read and very sad but WOW  the ending was a bit of a surprise  Loved it  It was so dark with fucked up characters  And also was brilliantly written and unputdownable  It kept me guessing all the way through  I really enjoyed this thriller  No spoilers     I wasn t sure where this book was going  and the multi perspective narration threw me a little  but I did find that I was sucked in and that the book picked up speed  hurtling towards the end like a freight train  Definitely a great read  WHAT        THE HELL This book broke my mind I don t know what else to say except  read it  Sometimes we look at other people s lives and believe they re perfect  especially when we compare them   negatively  usually   to our own  reminding ourselves of our faults  our lacks  our unfulfilled wants  In this story  a woman named Rachel takes the train to and from London every day  going past a group of houses she knows well  She lived in one of those houses before  when she was happy   or so she told herself  as she remembered being married to Tom  a man she drove to infidelity through her drinking  Four doors down live Jason and Jess  the perfect golden couple in their perfect golden house  Except their names aren t Jason and Jess  Rachel doesn t know them  but every day as she peeks into their lives from the train  she makes up details that make them real to her  They re happy  they re in love  they have everything she lacks  And then one day  Rachel sees something unexpected  something that shatters her illusion and changes her life I never expected this book to be so intense  It is a keen psychological thriller that pokes into the thoughts and motivations of its characters  Rachel and her alcoholism  her guilt and shame  constantly berating herself as she descends further down into the dark chasms of her addiction  How rational her insanity seems  as she tries to understand her own actions  both drunk and sober  Megan  petite and bird like  blonde and beautiful  haunted by a secret so dark it cripples her ability to live the careless life she is offered by her husband  And Anna  a fierce lioness when it comes to protecting her family  even in the face of questions that may fracture everything she loves This book made me think how sometimes we believe what we want to believe  how love is an illusion because we tend to love the story we choose about the other person  as long as that story suits us  This is also a book about the lies we tell  both to others and to ourselves  A gripping thriller that kept me on my toes   highly recommendable  Great summer read  I read it on the train  This was such a page turner  Really kept you guessing  Great read  Why is this book at the top of everyone s must read list  Because it s fabulous   I am a voracious reader  with at least 2 books going at all times  At the ripe old age of 44  I now know what I like  and this book had it all  A mystery chock full of thrills  Check  Break neck pacing  Check  Fully formed characters with plausible motivations and actions  Check again  I figured out the mystery before the big reveal  and that still didn t leave me disappointed   Eager to see what else Hawkins can create  An immersive absorbing read that I couldn t wait to return to and thought about when I wasn t reading it  Exactly what you want in a good page turner  believable characters and a disaster slowly unfurling with one person on the track of truth who no ones believes  Only one point bugged me  With the price of train tickets what they are  how on earth could Rachel afford to commute daily with no job     Minor point that didn t detract from the book   This is a terrfically exciting  page turning psychological thriller   whodunnit   or what  Not quite sure how to categorise it  Probably thriller  with contemporary women s fiction elements Rachael s life is in a mess  Her husband left her two years before for another woman  she hasn t been able to have a child  she s living in a semi friend s spare room and she s sinking into alcoholism  She has also lost her job   despite this  she s been taking the morning and evening commuter train into central London every day  in order to maintain a facade of employment  The train nearly always stops at a signal just at the bottom of the gardens to a street of terraced houses  and it happens to be the street where Rachael used to live with her husband Watching these houses every day while the train halts  Rachael has become mildly obsessed with a couple who have moved in three doors down from where her ex husband still lives with his new wife and their baby  She often sees a pretty girl out in the garden terrace with her handsome husband  and begins to fantasise about the perfect life that they must lead together  Until one day  she sees the girl embracing a man who is not her husband   and the next day  the girl goes missing  After this  the story moves at a smooth  taut pace as Rachael gets drawn deeper and deeper into the mystery and the real life of that perfect couple  I can t say much in detail about the plot as all of it would be spoilers  and I think it s definitely better to read this book with as little idea as possible of what s coming  I have to say that it touches on themes that I personally find upsetting  and I would probably not have chosen to read it had I known about a couple of the dark places it goes   so I m glad I didn t know in advance  because this is just a fantastic read and I would have missed out Thoroughly recommended  you don t have to like the characters  they all have dark sides  go for the mystery  the story runs in circles and won t give you an idea who baddest person is until you ve read 80   it will gut you at some points too  you ll empathize with the characters and feel frustrated with them   A Freaking Wonderful NovelThe best book I have read in months  EVERYTHING is just so crazy  couldn t put it down   LOVE LOVE LOVE this book  BRAVO     would recommend to anyone     Rachel rides a train into London every day  passing houses  glimpsing through windows  and wondering what s going on behind them  Riding the train every day is a front  a cover to establish her absence on a daily basis  Secretly  she s lost her job  a result of her drinking problem  a reality she must hide from her roommate  There is one house in particular that she passes every day  It used to be hers  until Tom  her husband  divorced her for Anna  Now  Tom and Anna live happily with their baby girl in her house  while Rachel wallows in alcoholic sorrow  eking out her means of survival  She drinks daily  suffers blackouts  and is one step away from being thrown out onto the street There is another house that Rachel passes every day  one belonging to a romantic and admirable young couple  She sees them ever day  She fantasizes about who they are and what their lives are like  The appearance of their blissful coexistence gives her some kind of unexplainable hope  She s even given them fictitious names   Jess and Jason   Then one day  Rachel sees something that catches her attention  the possibility of existing infidelity in the young couple s perfect world  Then  she sees something even more mysterious Paula Hawkins   The Girl on the Train  is a well paced  page turning  and fascinating read  Her characters are finely sketched  realistic  and genuinely crafted  The mystery is consistent and leaves the reading guessing from the point when Rachel sees  Jess s  face splashed across the newspaper  to the final climax  The fictitious  Jess  is a young woman named Megan  who lives only a few doors down from Tom and Anna  She has suddenly gone missing  Hawkins tells the story through the first person accounts of Rachel  Megan  and Anna  interwoven throughout the book  and with a talent well versed in Agatha Christie Rachel hits rock bottom and rebounds into high wire walking sobriety  She begins to examine two of the possible suspects  Megan s husband  Scott  and Megan s lover  her therapist  She learns many things about the suspects and many truths about Megan as the mystery thickens  Then  Rachel s memories about a certain night begin to return as her recovery progresses  She s not believable to the police  she s been involved in past boundary issues with Tom and Anna and deemed a stalker  As Rachel s mind clears  so does the mystery  which leads to the nail biting end Paula Hawkins is an amazing new mystery author  Her next book should be anxiously awaited   The Girl on the Train  is slated to become a feature film in 2016  Let s hope it lives up to the book  wow  what a debut novel  gripping and gritty and scary in places  I loved all 3 characters and didn t see the twist coming until it literally smacked me in the face  highly recommend I  read  this book as a book on tape as I was driving from Florida to Pennsylvania  I am pretty sure if I had had the book in my hand  I would have read it in a day  Hearing the  conversations  between characters really kept things intense  So many twists and turns I felt I was on a roller coaster  The moment I knew what had happened was surprising  but the enormity of the happening was even more so   Guys  This is a good one  It s not quite as twisted as Gone Girl but still has surprises and an ending that did not leave me questioning if these characters would really tie it all up like that  I love an unreliable narrator and there are 3 of them in this book  Very good  I liked it better than Gone Girl HEAVY SPOILERS AHEADI was struggling between 4 stars and 5 stars and decided to go with a 5 because this book is honestly that good People comparing it to Gone Girl are wrong in many ways but the major for me being that this book had an ending  And ending distinguishable from the whole story  My biggest problem with Gone Girl was that it eventually ended exactly where it started only with all the cards open and a kid in picture Let s talk characters  shall we   Each and everyone is a friggin nutjob  Every character in this book has some sort of Mental disorder or is crazy in some way Megan  with her crazy idea of victory when Tom kept coming to her and her wanting more than what she already had Scott with his anger issues and  well  sleeping with a woman months after your wife s death ain t normal Anna with the blind love and nervousness syndrome Cathy with her constant sorrys Rachel with her need to be involved and stalking And the Lord of all the Crackpots  Tom  who literally had a need to lie and severe anger issues Maybe that s what made the book so readable  you couldn t  as a reader  trust one single person  Hell  even the psychiatrist was in love with his patient It is the best feeling when in a fast paced suspense killer  the bad guy gets his just desserts and that happened here This book is great and no wonder everyone is loving it  Paula Hawkins debut novel is the ultimate psychological thriller that will keep your pulses racing until the very last page The story is narrated through the eyes and pen of Rachel a lonely somewhat miserable young woman who drinks a lot  let s face it Rachel is an alcoholic  Every morning she commutes by train to London to work  there is also a fantasy going on here as she see the same couple every day from the window of her carriage and creates a fantasy world for this couple  What we then realise here is that the sub plot is that this couple live just a few doors away from Rachel s ex husband Tom and his new wife Anna  The narration from Rachel is something that makes The Girl on the Train something very special and incredibly insightful from a woman whose life really has come off the rails  Through the narration you begin to understand how Rachel lives a life through a glass and if often so drunk she has no memory of what has happened in her life  She has had a drink problem for quite some time and the fact that she lost her job because of it adds to the mystery of her daily train journeys into London Many reviews I have read of Paula Hawkins debut novel said they could not show any empathy with Rachel  yet I totally became involved with her and she stands out to me more so than any of the other lead characters  yet I am not entirely sure why  I put this down to the incredible skill of Hawkins writing and how she has portrayed Rachel  When Megan goes missing Rachel believes she holds vital information as what happened  but alas Rachel s memory is vague to say the least and struggles to recall exact details and the frustration that bubbles to the surface in this taught thriller  Add to this that Rachel continues to harass her ex husband  lies and is viewed with incredible amount of suspicion by those around her  Rachel decides to take it upon herself to get involved in the investigation into the disappearance of Megan and also those very close to the investigation  There is a real twist to the end of the story that will keep you gripped until the very last moments as Rachel finally recalls some detail from one of her previous blackouts  There is so much more to The Girl on the Train that it is at times completely unpredictable a clever and refreshingly brilliant thriller With the huge success of Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl still very much fresh in our minds  2015 has seen some brilliant thrillers based around poisonous relationships but without a shadow of doubt The Girl on the Train is the runaway success of the year and a global smash hit and with a film now due to hit the screens late 2016 staring Emily Blunt in the lead role will surely be just as successful on the screen as the book has been through 2015 If you have been living anywhere other than this planet and you have not yet experienced The Girl on the Train  make this a Christmas book choice to curl up with over the holidays and experience what the rest of the World has in this roller coaster of a modern psychological thriller  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Is  The Girl on the Train  destined to be the Blockbuster Breakout of 2015  It s sure shaping up to be  I ve gotta admit  now that I stayed up late last night  then rose early this morning to finish  in that delicious hour before anyone else  when reading feels like the guiltiest pleasure   HECK YEAH IT IS  All the buzz for this is that it s the  next Gone Girl  and it s an apt comparison  Only instead of one unreliable female narrator  Paula Hawkins  gives us three  all great  all wanting something different and yet  in so many ways  the same thing  There is Rachel  the drunk who starts the story with her keen observations aboard her daily train into London  Megan  the woman Rachel sees from the train whose life she fantasizes about  though for reasons she ll soon discover  shouldn t   and Anna  the one who unites them  whose philandering gives her what she wants yet will burn her in the end The book is fast paced and leaves you guessing until a point where  even though you suspect the outcome  you still plow through to find out how Hawkins takes you to the end  As I often do  I read some articles on the book and discovered the author sold  The Girl on the Train  on a partial manuscript  fewer than 100 pages and an outline   If you re unfamiliar with how the publishing world works  you should know this is EXTREMELY rare  Meaning her agent and her editors all knew she was on to something  and what a satisfying something it was  particularly that ending   I loved the last line and the way it brought the story full circle  In interviews she gives  Hawkins seems surprised at the book s success  but she should hold on  the buzz is only going to build from here  As the bookseller in this article noted   The Girl on the Train is intense  and it s in an Internet sense  shareable    by that I mean  once you read it you want your friends to read it too so you can talk about it  Once a book becomes viral like that  there s no slowing it down    Source  http   www theglobeandmail com arts b    So yeah  prepare yourself to hear a LOT about this one  if you haven t already  And if you want to talk about it afterward  well  I m all ears  Girl on the Train could easily be entitled Girl on the Train Wreak  Nevertheless  I found this to be a very entertaining read and I think the movie will be a thriller too I don t give many books 5 stars but GOTT hit my personal criteria to earn the top rating from me  My approach to star ratings is based on my eagerness to continue reading a particular book  Three stars means I look forward to continuing and probably finishing the book at some point  Four stars equates to looking very forward to picking up the story again soon and will finish it for sure  And 5 stars indicates that I actually rearrange my schedule and priorities to continue reading the book and finish it asap  GOTT started as a 3 star for me but  quickly went to 4  At about the halfway point it moved to a 5 as I became more engrossed and connected to the characters and intrigued with the mystery of what s coming next  as well as what Rachel was going to drink next I particularly enjoyed the format of breaking the happenings of the days  and therefore the story  into two parts   morning and evening and also stating the dates  It gave the book a manageable and predictable pace around a number of unpredictable turns  It also allowed me to keep organized around the different players and  of course  the time frames too  The fact that I had a visceral frustration with the characters as the story unfolded speaks to the effectiveness of Hawkins writing  I can fully appreciate why this was a Goodreads choice award for 2015   I wasn t sure I d like this book when I started but the thing about reading a book for a book club is that is makes me keep reading when I might have otherwise stopped  And in this case  I m glad I kept reading  The further I got into the book the more hooked I became  I was dying to figure out what happened and Rachel s black outs just added to that suspense and mystery  I felt for her as a character because I believed she was a good person who just needed help  This has got to be by far the most intriguing book  I have read this year  I highly recommend reading this book  This is a new author for me  and this is her first thriller  This story is told from many point of views  it starts out with Rachel  who daily rides the train  each day she passes by one house  where she notices a couple  She envisions that this couple is perfect and dreams up their ideal life  even giving them names of Jess and Jason  who really are Scott and Megan Hipwell  Rachel has made a mess of her own life  Rachel drinks too much  and it is easy to get annoyed with her for not seeing the destruction  she is bringing into her life  She is divorced from Tom Watson  who is remarried to Anna  and Rachel is living with her friend Cathy  The story is told from Rachel  Anna and Megan s view  As the story unfolds  one begins to understand what leads to Rachel s drinking  then one day as the train goes by  Rachel saw something that involves the couple  that she deems perfect  After a newscast  Rachel realizes that maybe what she saw is vital information  and goes to the police  Rachel gets drawn in further and further into the investigation  but is she helping or hindering it  What a ride  I read this in 1 1 2 days  Great from start to finish Rachel is such a wonderful character  Both good and bad  I really felt for her If you love thrillers  give this one a read  You won t be disappointed  Two damaged characters are the main contributors to this storyline  Their everyday lives have been shattered by their past  so as you discover their backstory  you also uncover the mystery of their present situation  I gave this book five stars because I felt that the two protagonists are very well described as they react to some of womankind s oldest problems  but I don t want to give any spoilers   Also  the book is perfectly paced and entertaining the whole way through while still managing to be a well executed literary work  Very good  Didn t suspect the ending  Terrific read  Main character sticks with you  The writer releases information of the plot carefully  and this contributes to the addictiveness of this book  Can t wait for Hawkins to release her second novel  One of the best thrillers I ve read  Highly recommend you carve out enough time to read in one sitting  The suspense is killer   Sarebbero 4 e mezzo le stelle  Comunque davvero gran bella storia  l ho trovata molto originale  Lettura molto scorrevole  l unica pecca e che la parte piu intrigante e concentrata tutta nelle ultime 100 pagine  Ma e un libro che consiglio a tutti coloro a cui piacciono i thriller    Ela esta enterrada a sombra de uma betula  ali junto aos velhos carris do comboio  com uma lapide a assinalar o tumulo  Nao passa de um monticulo de pedras  alias  Eu nao queria atrair atencoes para a sua ultima morada  mas tambem nao a poderia deixar sem lembranca  Ha de descansar em paz ali  sem que alguem a venha perturbar  sem outra companhia alem do canto dos passaros e do

um livro incrivel  belissimo  viciante e intrigante  superou em muito as minhas expectativas Nao deixem de ler  A Rapariga no Comboio  como eu estava fazendo Recomendo sem reservas a autora Paula Hawkins que irei seguir sem duvida alguma Excelente 5      Loved it  A thriller much like Gone Girl with narrators you can t help but relate to   flaws and all  The author does a great job of making you guess until the very end  who dunnit  and once you find out  you ll catch yourself second guessing everything you thought you knew about Rachel  Wonderfully written and a solid 5 star read  This book was a complete mindf ck    SERIOUSLY     It was one of the best novels I read  READ THIS BOOK     Wow   a book written about real people  You never know what goes on behind closed doors  You never know what makes someone do the things they do  You never really realize how people are connected until you go digging around  Everyone in this book has something to hide  and they all could be guilty of murder  but only one is a true killer  This was one of the most engaging books I ve come across this year  It s hard to give credence to the negative reviews  because it s quite likely they never read the book in its entirety  Many people have a difficult time with the first 50 pages of any book  and one notices such reviews rarely give details  This book takes unreliable narrators to a wholly new level  Perspectives keep changing  You find yourself asking   Are my predictions based on unsound thinking  provided by an unsound narrator   In fact  the reader is never quite sure of anything but the inexorable progress of the central mystery  The solution is like an image in a thick fog  a life size figure that only becomes visible as various narrators  points of view coalesce  It is a wonderful thing to see a talented author use such a daring literary device to such astonishing effect  Slow confusing start  partly because I didn t read a description of the book and never took note of the dates  but man once I caught on to the story it was a page turner   4 5 StarsWhoa  I mean  this is a good book  I was so doubtful when everyone kept referring to it like Gone Girl  mostly just because it s a well written thriller to from a female POV written by a female   but I m glad I jumped on this train  pun intended   Rachel   I loved this character  I think she embodies that side of everyone that we keep locked away  That side of us that holds all of our embarrassing things  I ve never been able to truly sympathize with an alcoholic and I didn t know if the fact that she was one would frustrate me to no end while reading  It did  but in a good way  I cannot tell you how many times I sincerely hoped she was sobering up for good and then when she would slip  my heart would ache for her  I felt a lot like her flat mate  Cathy  Rachel s blackouts  which are SO interesting on a psychological level  truly made this story and made Rachel one of the best characters I ve read in a while  Anna   Four words for you homegirl  Chill  The  Heck  Out  I mean  I get it  I do  but chill  Just chill  You don t own your town  You can t call the police every time Rachel shows up  In this  I m grateful for Tom  I m glad he talked her out of it so many time   view spoiler   actually  in hindsight  knowing that she lived with Tom really explains her crazy paranoia with Rachel  He probably used that paranoia against Anna and most likely heightened it  Ugh  Tom    hide spoiler  Megan Jess   Poor girl  My heart broke for her so many times  I can imagine how I would be even close sane after expediting what she did  She was another character that was interesting to read about  She seemed crazy and unstable like the other two women and then you find out the root and it explains so much  Then her odd behaviors make complete sense  You understand why she is restless and needs constant love and emotional attention  Poor  poo girl   view spoiler   Tom   I kind of saw this coming  I was highly suspicious of him about half way through the book because  Komal was too obvious  as was Rachel and Scott  and I though maybe Anna was in on it  but I had to be Tom  He was the only one that it could have been where you weren t thrown for a complete loop  He was shady to me  Like hella shady  And now knowing how messed up he is  I wish we had more background  Like why he is that way  just like we got each of the women s background as to why they were  crazy   Also  as a thought  did he even go to work everyday  I mean  was he the boy on the train  We find out he lied about everything and then we have him coming home from work whenever he pleases and a huge debt owed to his parents  I doubt he did what he really did for work  Actually  I just doubt everything that he does and everything that comes out of his mouth  I m glad Anna and Rachel were able to see his end together  I think it s the only way either of them would have been able to cope and move one with life    hide spoiler  Overall it was a great book and I can t wait to read more from Paula  WOW  ignored my finals to finish this  amazing   My kind of book  Couldn t put it down  Loved it   I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts   The Girl on The Train follows the perspective of three females that are initially only loosely connected  Rachel  an extreme alcoholic  takes the train every day and begins to feel like she personally knows a married couple that she sees as she passes every evening  When that wife  Megan  goes missing  Rachel feels the need to step in and figure out the case herself Many people have compared this book to Gone Girl  which is one of my favorite books  and now The Girl on The Train has also won my Best Book Award  But I like these books for different reasons  In general  I would say that if you liked Gone Girl  you would probably like this book and vice versa  However  if you didn t like Gone Girl  don t completely discredit this one  While they are both thrillers with dysfunctional female leads  The Girl on The Train is much faster paced and not as horrifyingly disturbing as Gone Girl  Many people  including me  hate books where the lead character is unlikeable  but The Girl on The Train is one of those books where you don t really need to like the main characters  Actually  you will probably hate most of them throughout the whole book  However  by the end I actually felt some sympathy for all but one of the characters  if you ve read the book you know who I am talking about  but I won t spoil it here  Read the rest of my review here  http   judgingmorethanjustthecover bl    Take the movie and novel Gone Girl  add a little fatal Attraction  and you have a chair gripping version of Paula Hawkins FIRST debut novel  Let me repeat  DEBUT  as in FIRST novel  I whipped through all of this EASILY in two days and you have to wonder  if this is her FIRST novel  HOW will she EVER match this one in subsequent writings Seen on Barnes   Noble bookshelves in the states everywhere rated in GoodReads as one of the top novel as well as in Booklist  I am SO glad I have this in our Upper School Library   I can t even begin to tell you how many times you will be shocked from the page turning plot Hawkins infuses   this is an all star find of the year    You ll see    Ok  I guess there are two camps when it comes to this book   HATE IT    and OH it was REALLY GOOD  Me  I liked it  I will pause for flying tomatoes     Ok  now that half of you said WHAT out loud   that is why I like no  love this book  First book in a long time I would talk back to the characters in the book  I pulled for Rachel and wanted to stop drinking  I would cringe every time she would get black out drunk and wake up the next day and say  Something bad happened   This was a book about a woman   who is a real alcoholic   trying to figure out what happened last night when she was black out drunk   did I mention she woke up with bruised and battered and with a deep feeling  Something bad happened    Oh  did I mention that a woman when missing in the same area and same time Rachel s last coherent memory of that night  Yes  I loved this book   There is someting about this book  You start it and when you look up again you are already half way through and think  How did this happen   I am not particulary fond of thriller and crime novels  but it just gripped me  right from the first page  It is chilling and exciting  You don t like the characters much  but sooner or later you get their motives  You start to understand  that you are not supposed to like them  you are supposed to feel with them  The Girl on the Train is a perfect book to read during a summer heat wave  it will chill you to the bones  Great debut  AwesomeCouldn t put this book down  Very similar to Gone Girl  Apparently  this is the author s first book  Fantastic  Quick read  This novel is well written  highly imaginative with twists and turns pulling the reader into a web of suspense  It doesn t get much better than this  The characters are not the sort you tend to feel any sort of compassion for  they are not likable and extremely faulty  The main protagonist of the story would be Rachel  a self destructive alcoholic followed by the mistress Anna who displaces Rachel  takes her husband for her own  her home   her life  and the neighbor Megan who has mega issues of her own  chiefly fidelity  The author writes the work going from the thoughts and actions of these three women as a first person narrative  I found a similar way of writing in  Gone Girl  by Gilllian Flynn  where the author moves back and forth like a she said  he said story  This involved into a three way thought process  The whole story flows and it s difficult to not want to know  what comes next    Who really know s anyone  really  If there was a underlying theme  I think this would be it  I found the book quite similar to Rachel Abbott s novel  Stranger Child in style and context  I can see the similarities with Gone Girl  Gillian Flynn  in the complexity of characters and storyline  I read The Girl on the Train  on the train and could imagine the scene so perfectly the characters on the train and in street  as well as houses backing on to the train line  I loved this book  could not put it down from around 60  through  I read through to the end in the early hours  Een pageturner om U tegen te zeggen  Meeslepend  moeilijk weg te leggen  Gone Girl didn t grab me like I thought it would and I got an advance readers copy of this from work and probably wouldn t have read it except the word of mouth was insane  That was some ride  I read about 100 pages before bed last night  woke up at 4am and devoured the last 120  Time didn t matter  I was so engrossed by the characters and the plot  Been a long time since I ve been this hooked on a book   I loved this book  Little slow at first but got totally awesome  Kept me on the edge of my seat page turner and I loved all the characters  I m thinking 4 5  what a rollercoaster    4 5 One of my favorite thriller books I ve ever read  Did not disappoint  Let me start by saying that I chose to go with an audiobook for this one  That being said  the narrators  performances were an enjoyable experience  It really brought the book to life  I think if I had done the ebook or paperback  I would still have liked the book but it may have dragged in a few places   The story was simple  but written well enough to keep me intrigued  Everyone was a suspect in my book  I enjoyed the triple female POV  People can be so pathetic  twisted and selfish and all of it is showcased in this book   Well  I put off reading this one for a while   heard good and bad about it  and there were comparisons with  Gone Girl   not all good  so I started it with some trepidation  and honestly  I couldn t have been more wrong  This is by far one of the most enjoyable and enthralling reads I have had in ages Rachel catches the same train each morning  and again each night  She knows all the stops and as she rattles along the tracks each day becomes a voyeur into the lives of those whose houses back onto the train tracks  including the people who now live in the home she once called her own   her ex husband and his new wife and child  She makes up names and creates a fantasy life for a young couple she frequently sees in their garden  and envies the perfect life they seem to have  But one day she sees something that shatters that fantasy  and she becomes entwined in the lives of these strangers  and her ex husband   drawing them all together in ways that no one could have seen coming Some critics have said this story is predictable   I must be getting a little jaded in my reading  because I actually didn t see some of the twists in this story until they were upon me  The pace was fantastic  definitely an express train    and I really liked the characters   so many examples of  all is not as it seems  here Buy yourself a ticket  get on board and enjoy the ride    If you like a good mystery  this is the book for you  This story will have you sitting on the edge of your seat  turning pages frantically until you get to the end  It was almost impossible to put down or to guess the outcome  The novel is written in the format of a journal or a diary  although the timeline is not a straight line  All of the main characters are introduced quickly into the narrative  and each slowly reveals personality traits When it begins  it is 2013  and Rachel Watson is riding on a train to London  She spies some clothes at the edge of the tracks and her mind begins to wander as she imagines whose they might be and how they might have gotten there  Rachel is unable to accept her divorce from her husband Tom  although a couple of years have passed  She has gained weight  drinks to excess and is obsessed with her ex husband s new life  As she rides  she reminisces about her marriage  She was a different  happier person once  very different until she discovered Tom s affair with Anna  until he left her  Anna became involved with Tom  even though she knew he was married  Tom and Anna have a young daughter and seem very happy  Rachel cannot accept this  From the train she can see her former home  but she avoids looking there  instead  she concentrates on a home a few doors away and watches a happy couple there that she has named Jess and Jason  In real life they are Scott and Megan Hipwell  but Rachel doesn t know this  As she rides the train  daily  she looks for them and creates a fantasy about their lives  He is the perfect husband  idolizing Jess as he chats with her outside  and she is an adoring  loving wife  Megan Hipwell seems very happy when she is viewed from the train  but secretly her life is coming unglued  Both Rachel and Megan have lost someone they love  both have trouble sleeping  both have lost their jobs  Megan had an art gallery that closed  Rachel lost her job because she drinks too much  becomes rude and argumentative and also blacks out and remembers little of what she does when she is drunk  Rachel is ashamed of her degenerate behavior  but Megan kind of likes to walk on the wild side  to live a bit dangerously  to test the water  Both of the women have secrets in their past or present lives  and both of the women want to travel  although one dreamt of traveling with her brother  and the other had dreamt of traveling with her husband to recapture their spark  Both want to improve the life they are living  The lives of the three women intersect as we discover that Anna  Rachel and Megan are connected  Anna  who was  the other woman   is afraid of Rachel and wants her to stop calling the house to harass them  Megan  Rachel s Jess   briefly takes a job as Anna s nanny  Rachel remains in love with Tom  and one night she returns to the neighborhood  gets drunk and blacks out  When she wakes up bruised and bleeding  sick to her stomach at home  she remembers little of how she spent the night or how she was injured  When she discovers that the woman Jess Megan goes missing that same night  and does not return  she becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her  of unlocking her lost memories  One day  on the train  Rachel notices that someone has written on the side of a building   Life is not a paragraph   She responds to that statement with her own   death is not a parenthesis   That short thought bubble stayed with me throughout the book as the mystery evolved  Death is not a part of the whole  Death is not an interlude or an afterthought  Life has a beginning and an end  and death is the end result  the final outcome The lives of Megan and Rachel do not run concurrently  Megan s begins a couple of years in the past  moving into the present  and eventually  each story line  Anna  Megan and Rachel s meet  bringing the book to a satisfying  but surprising conclusion   Original Blog Review  https   myescapebookscoffeetea wordpr   My Blog  http   myescapebookscoffeetea wordpre    My Instagram  http

4 5 StarsOk  I really am speechless When I started reading this book I was so  but so confused that you really can t even imagine  When I bought it I wanted to like this book because everyone in this world loves this book    everyone says awesome things about it    so why not  I wanted it  I saw it and I bought it Since I was kind of still am in a reading slump and I didn t know what to read because I was not in the mood to read anything I picked it up just to see if it was that good    as good as everyone says it is    and OH BOY  yes  it is awesome As I mentioned before yes  I was confused at the beginning and I was confused during most part of the book and I think that I am still confused with some stuff  but some things started making sense  There were a lot of characters    there were Megan  Jess  Scott  Tom  Anna  Rachel    and I was like  WHAT      and then I just started thinking and I discovered that some characters didn t exist  some characters were just one character with two different names    yes I am not making sense because I don t really want to spoil everything for you  So if you want to know what the hell I m talking about go ahead and read the book   I think that the most important thing to read this book is to have some patience    and to pay attention while you are reading it    because there are some things that you can actually discover at the beginning of the book if you are paying that attention that I was talking about    and those same things that you can discover by yourself are only explained at the end of the book    so you can save some years of your life if you are paying attention  believe me    because otherwise you are going to get really nervous and you are going to feel like you are getting mad sometimes because you can t figure out what s really happening and your heart will start racing and you will seriously lose at least 5 years of your own life     kind of  I am just being kind of dramatic  Now for real    this book was amazing  but I have to tell you    at the beginning it was quite hard to stay tuned    I m being honest with you when I say that I wanted to give up    I was thinking that I couldn t like this book because it was boring    I thought that I was going to be the only person in this world not liking this story    but I was pretty wrong    I finished the book and I just loved it    it was really good  you just have to be patient and to try to understand what the author is trying to show you    once you get into the story  once you understand what s happening you can t put the book down  Some books are very easy to review  and this is one of them   The Girl on The Train  is simply excellent  Immediately engaging and gripping  with a carefully constructed plot and readily believable  and even recognisable  characters  I had actually been a little reluctant to read this book following the immense hype that has surrounded its huge success on both sides of the Atlantic  and because a lot of people had compared it to Gillian Flynn s  Gone Girl   which I had not liked at all  In the end  I relented simply because I was on holiday and saw it on offer at a very cheap price and decided to give it a go  That was certainly a fortuitous decision The book takes the form of alternating narratives from Rachel  an alcoholic divorcee who regularly commutes from Hertfordshire into London on a route that passes the house where she previously li9ved with her ex husband  She becomes intrigued by the house just four along from her old home  which she comes to observe on a regular basis as her train is invariably brought to a halt at the foot of its garden  Seeing the occupants  who had arrived since she lived in that street  she starts to imagine their life  even assigning them names and speculating about their respective jobs  Rachel is not a happy person  and as her narrative proceeds we gain an alarming insight into her lifestyle which is not as it initially seems Interspersed with Rachel s story we are offered Megan s narrative  which starts about a year earlier than Rachel s  Megan lives in the house that Rachel observes almost every day  but the story that she unwinds reveals a very different life from that which Rachel had imagined for her The portrayal of a personality unwinding  and the events that unfold as a consequence is fascinating  Hawkins combines very sharp observation with immense suspense  producing a heady and addictive brew  Having started the book I found it very difficult to put it down  Well I am giving that five stars because I though it was original  exciting and very very readable  I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience including the unpleasant but quite real characters  the clever story line involving the trains and the final twist regarding who the murderer actually was  I did guess that in advance but knowing did not in any way spoil the last chapter  I loved the parts where the girl is looking out of the train and making up stories about the people she sees  I   m sure lots of us peer out into people s windows and back yards when we are travelling by train  I know I do  Any way I enjoyed this book much more than the blurb led me to believe I would and that made me very happy   An amazing thriller  couldn t put it down   Listened to this book on Audible  Couldn t stop listening  Finished it in two days walking around everywhere with headphones   Wow okay this book  As you can see I gave it 5 stars so it was a good one  I don t know if thats because it was so brutal that I was so shocked and had to kept reading to find out or because I liked the writing  What on earth s wrong with you  Are you drunk   he asks  but I can see in his eyes that he knows I m sober and I m betting that for once he wishes I wasn t  Thats some good writing The story starts out in the first person perspective of Rachel  a reckless  depressed  newly divorced  drunk who rides the train everyday to portray to her roommate that she still has a job  that she got fired for  for being too drunk Then the story switches to Megans perspective  A depressed  reckless  run a wayer kinda girl from all her problems  Seem familiar  Megan lost her brother in a motorcycle accident and is still grieving  So she hooks up with men to try and make her feel wanted  good  And just like Megan all of these characters in this book are whack  They all have profoundly messy lives and are just trying to figure it all out  Rachel rides the train everyday to get away from her life and looks at this one perfect looking house in particular and starts to make up a story about the couple that lives in that perfect looking lifestyle  And reflects it on her own marriage before the divorce  You learn that the people that living in that perfect house are none other then Megan and Scott  So when Megan goes missing Rachel sees her in the papers as an opportunity and decides she can do something that might be useful in her life and find out what happened to Megan  Did Megan run away  or was she kidnapped  What about the man that Rachel saw kissing Megan one morning  Megan s sections then become flash backs in time to before she disappeared  Slowly learning about Rachel and Megan and why she finds warmth in being with so many men  The Girl on the Train is a must read to kids over 16    Its super creepy 5 5 10 10Would read again  I was not prepared  This book is dark and controlling  and I could not stop until it was done  It does have shades of Gone Girl but a somewhat more satisfying ending  I m already casting the characters in my head Damn  That was a trip  Cheating husbands  dead wives  drunks  and so much more drama At first  I didn t understand the hype around this book  I didn t like it  The beginning is really sad  The characters are all very flawed  marred by their own vices  But getting towards the end  the plot suddenly twists and everything you expected to happen doesn t  You thought you knew the characters but then you learn the truth  No one is who you think they are  You re just as surprised as the characters  The author straps you into a rollercoaster of a dramatic triumphant ending  Wow  What an exciting read  HOLY S  T   This book is so so so good  It has me wanting to read more and it wasn t predictable  Which was great because I don t like books were you can tell the ending  The only thing I didn t like was that it was a little bit confusing but other than that  it was a absolutely AMAZING  When I first began this book  it frustrated me  the three lead characters were  an alcoholic  a depressed and unhappy woman and an embittered new mother  How would I ever get through it when the protagonists were unsympathetic and annoying  I am so glad I persisted because the book is a thrilling read and so worth the investment of time and energy Anyone who has commuted to work will understand Anna s situation  as she takes the train to and from work every day  she looks out the window and imagines the lives of those who live in the homes along the route  But  when this situation is combined with Anna s alcoholism and her inability to maintain control of her life  her memories and her stories  you can see just how scary it can be when a real  honest to goodness crime occurs on her train route After I got over my initial annoyance with the three characters  I was riveted by the story and by the author s creative ability to keep the mystery fresh and have it unfold slowly  not revealing the culprit until the end Excellent read  This novel kept me in limbo all the way to the end  The author is exceptionally talented at setting up the characters and plot  I loved the Hitchcockian style of writing   twists and turns were unexpected  I hope this author is working on her next thriller  My two dear friends recommended me this book and said I would like it since it is similar to the gone girl  Then it turns out I really love it  I am crazy about it  It is the first English novel I have ever finished  I couldn t stop reading it even English is not my first language  I always stayed up the whole night last night to finish the book  The ending is so unexpected and surprising to me  I love stories that I can t guess the end   One of the best books I ve read in a while finished it in 2 days because I couldn t put it down  just loved it  it s the kind of thriller where you can t put the book down  Fun book that kept me staying up late just to read another chapter Wow  Just wow  On the one hand  I don t want to give this too good of a review  because I don t want to make others  expectations too high  That might ruin it  This book need to sneak inside and wow you when you don t expect it  On the other hand  this was exquisite It s a bit like a roller coaster  steady yet fun at the start  the tension builds slowly but surely thought the first half   you re intrigued  not quite certain if this is going to be amazing or just fun  and it s okay if you need to set the book down now and then  The tension crests at the midway point  and there is no setting this book down  it is a breathless ride to the end The story is told from three points of view  Rachel  Anna  and Megan  If I have one quibble with this book  it s that the three voices are not sufficiently distinct   there were a few times she I would lose sight of who was speaking  and I d get  you  and  I  confused  and have to go back and check  That said  I definitely identified best with Rachel  She is the one I think of as the main character  the one who has the most depth  the one I understood the best  Rachel is fucked up  but I could easily see myself slipping into the mess she s in Through the first half  I found myself comparing this to other recent thrillers  Before I Go To Sleep and Gone Girl  This story is the one that might be told if the main character of Before I Go to Sleep was investigating the disappearance in Gone Girl  but both of those books were a bit too over the top to feel real  A mistake this book does not make Hawkins  writing is exquisite in its spareness  The character s musings appeal to my Inner Bitch  Beautiful sunshine  cloudless skies  no one to play with  nothing to do  Living like this  the way I m living at the moment  is harder in the summer when there is so much daylight  so little cover of darkness  when everyone is out and about  being flagrantly  aggressively happy  It s exhausting  and it makes you feel bad if you re not joining in  She must be very secure in herself  I suppose  in them  for it not to bother her  to walk where another woman has walked before  She obviously doesn t think of me as a threat  I think about Ted Hughes  moving Assia Wevill into the home he d shared with Plath  of her wearing Sylvias  clothes  brushing her hair with the same brush  I want to ring Anna up and remind her that Assia ended up with her head in the oven  just like Sylvia did  Cathy is waiting for me when I get home  She s standing in the kitchen  aggressively drinking a glass of water   That simple image  of  aggressively  drinking a glass of water     it communicates so much in so few words  Cathy  normally ridiculously nice and accommodating  is angry  justifiably angry  she s stewing  she s simmering with all the things she wants to say  but she is also passive aggressive in her anger  she withholds the words and lets it out in small gestures  I would never think to describe it that way  but it is perfect Things I liked 1  The characters are complex  with both good and bad qualities  except for the villain  in the end  2  I did not guess who the villain was 3  I LOVE the Unreliable Narrator trope  it makes the puzzle that much more fun to solve  FREAKING LOVED THIS This book was the Best birthday present ever Couldn t stop reading it  didn t see the ending coming And  best of all  now I want to go back and read it all over again  dissecting every chapter for the clues  Like Rachel  I dream up lives of the inhabitants of houses I pass when traveling  Unlike Rachel  I never intend on getting mixed up in the realities of those neighbourhoods Way better than  Gone Girl   I actually felt empathy towards the women especially Rachel and Anna in this psychological thriller  I didn t feel anything positive towards Nick and Amy in  Gone Girl  and nearly closed the book part way through  At least all of main characters got what they deserved in both books In the upcoming film version  it will be interesting to see if the director can repeat the story s tension and how Emily Blunt fares as Rachel  Hopefully I won t be disappointed  This gripping thriller will keep you up all night  It s no surprise that it has been compared to Gone Girl  because just like Gillian Flynn s riveting mystery  the characters are well developed and the plot is filled with endless twists  Just when you feel that you get to know the characters  they shock you with secrets from their past or bold  unexpected actions Rachel is a depressingly hopeless alcoholic  riding the train to London daily to avoid telling her roommate that she got fired from her job  From her seat on the train she observes the people in the houses she passes  One particular couple  whom she names  Jess and Jason   appear so happy and makes Rachel long for the life she once had when she was happily married to Tom and beginning to plan a family  Rachel   They re a match  they re a set  They re happy  I can tell  They re what I used to be  Rachel s fantasy of  Jess and Jason   really Megan and Scott  could not be further from the truth  as both have secrets to hide and a depressing relationship  Megan   I can t do this  I can t just be a wife  I don t understand how anyone does it   there is literally nothing to do but wait  Wait for a man to come home and love you  Either that or look around for something to distract you   Rachel discovers a secret about her imagined  Jess  shortly before Megan disappears  While Rachel feels betrayed by a person she thought she knew  but never actually met   she finds a new purpose in her life and dedicates her existence to solving the mystery of Megan s disappearance  Rachel   I am no longer just a girl on the train  going back and forth without point or purpose   She becomes deeply tangled in a mess of deceit and lies  and realizes quickly that no one can be trusted All the characters are so tainted by their flaws  and yet they are so honest and depressingly real that you can t help but relate to them  This story goes to show that even the seemingly happiest people have their secrets and baggage  Rachel can t stop drinking herself into a blackout stupor  while longing to get back together with her abusive ex and become a mother  believing that this would make her worthwhile  Meanwhile  Megan was unhappy in her marriage  seeking comfort elsewhere  and happened to cross paths with Anna  the new wife of Rachel s ex husband  Everyone is mysteriously connected  and it turns out that Rachel is actually the good one  the one who loves unconditionally  forgives the faults of others  and recognizes the dangers of following one s heart   Jedna z lepszych ksiazek  jakie czytalam od dluzszego czasu  Decydujac sie na lekture tej powiesci  zasugerowalam sie rekomendacja mojego

todo lo que prometieron  rapido de leer  buena escritura  buena trama  un gran giro en la historia  que no vi venir  y mas Creo que el un gran thriller psicologico que realmente cumple con la definicion de  no puedes confiar en nadie  El unico pero que tengo con este libro  pero que no es algo malo  es que todos los principales me producian cierto rechazo  ya sea por sus personalidades  sus acciones o motivaciones  pero eso hace que el libro sea diferente y refrescante  Debo aclarar que no he leido Gone girl  por lo que no tengo punto de comparacion con otro libro de este estilo 100  recomendado   from Erin I don t generally read  The Book Everyone is Talking About   but for some reason The Girl on the Train appealed to me  The story begins on a regular Friday with a regular commuter on her daily trip to the office  Rachel is an unhappy alcoholic  recently divorced  who still pines after her ex husband and is consumed with jealousy for his new wife and baby  Every day she sees a house and a couple from the train  and has invented a happy back story for them that she clearly wishes for herself  Inevitably  things are much messier than they seem on the surface  for Rachel  the couple  her ex husband and his wife  and just about everyone in the book  This book reminded me of Gone Girl in some respects  in that a woman s disappearance is at the heart of the story  many of the characters are awful people  and everyone s life is a wreck  But the central mystery is so engaging that you want to keep reading  If it tells you anything  I read the entire book in one sitting  Get on the list now because it s really long  Mind blowing   Full review will be up asap  for now tho    i loved it  Holy cow    I enjoyed this book immensely  It was intense and gripping  and very well written  I would not compare it to Gone Girl  which is how it s described in a lot of reviews  It was soooo much better  While it does have an unreliable narrator  she s unreliable in a different way  Highly recommend  I listened to this book twice in 2015  Feb  July  The beginning was a bit dry but a phenomenal ending  Ok  Wow  Looks like it is the year if the thriller for me where favourite stories are concerned  Triad  Before I Go To Sleep and now this After an admittedly shaky start for me that left me dubious about the potential rest of the novel with the initially jarring switches between characters and dates  at some point I seemed to find the  signal place  and from then on was swept up in the speed of one desperate to see the story through to its conclusion  I even lost track of time towards the end  reading in huge chunks that felt like no time at all lost in the thrills  red herrings and suspense  I can count on one hand the number of novels that have had me in that situation in the past year so far  but this has proven a wonderful addition to that list Suffice to say  I can certainly see why this book has remained in it s chartered positions and garnered such public interest  My instinct told me when I first found this book when it was initially published that it would become something big  For once I was right  and for once I agree  I guess all I can add now is that I hope the supposed film adaptation anticipated about this can will live up to the transfixing nature of the novel  Kudos Ms Hawkins  the best debut thriller I have enjoyed in a while  excellent book  Rachel rides the same commuter train every day on her way to and from work in London  While the train stops at a signal as it s going behind a row of suburban homes  she s able to watch a young married couple have breakfast on their deck  She doesn t really know them  but just by watching them every day she feels like she does  She s even made up names for them  Jess and Jason  and life stories  just based around what she sees of them for a few seconds every morning  but they seem like a perfect couple  But then one morning  she sees something shocking  something that urges her to go to the police  After she tells them what she knows  she becomes inextricably entangled in the  perfect  couple s life whether she wants to be or not  And  Rachel s involvement just might cause more harm than good I could not put The Girl on the Train down  I found myself really invested in the mystery surrounding both Rachel and  Jess   I love a good psychological thriller and this is no exception  Hawkins characters and plot are complex  require focus  and are bound to pull you in  Usually I have problems making it through books where the main character isn t likable and let s just say Rachel is someone you wouldn t want to be friends with  or acquaintances with  at all  For that matter  none of the characters are all that likable  But  in the case of this novel  I was so wrapped up in solving the mystery and piecing our unreliable narrator s story together that I developed a love hate relationship with the character If you like Alfred Hitchcock films  Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn  and unreliable narrators  you might love The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  I expect this addicting novel will be one of my favorites of 2015 and I m interested in anything Hawkins has coming up Seriously  just go read the book already  Really good suspense novel  Kept me on edge and guessing the whole book  I like the writing and it has good flow   The Girl on the Train is an entertaining book  The five main characters in the book are well drawn  The nagging question that haunts me about the book is   What is the meaning of the train   The train acts as a sixth main character in the story  For me it read like an Agatha Christie Whodunit  The author wove together the three female characters  narratives like an impressionistic painting  This book is well worth reading  THE GIRL ON THE TRAINThis psychological thriller is being labeled this year s  Gone Girl  but I think it s better  It s fast paced and addictive  The twists and turns kept me guessing all over the place  until the very end Dreamworks has already snatched up the movie rights  THE GIRL ON THE TRAINFasten your seatbelts  It s going to be a bumpy night Rachel is divorced  unemployed and considers herself worthless  She believes women are valued for 2 things  their looks and their roles as mothers  Rachel is barren and she considers herself too plain looking  She also drinks too much  to the point of regular blackouts  The next day she can t remember where she went  what she said  what she did  etc    She s a hot mess  but you can t help but feel sympathy for her  Rachel rides the commuter train twice a day  pretending to go to work  so her landlady will not evict her  Every day her train slows and stops near the Victorian row home she used to share with her ex husband  Tom  who now lives there with his gorgeous wife Anna and their new baby  To distract herself from obsessing over her ex  Rachel turns her focus to another couple who live two doors down  She refers to them as the  golden couple   she gives them names and fantasizes about their perfect life together   A voyeristic photo by Gail AlbertOne day Megan  the female half of the  golden couple   goes missing and her case becomes headline news  That same night  a few doors down  Rachel was reported to the police for harassing and stalking her ex husband and his new wife  Anna  Anna and Megan bear such a striking resemblance to one another  the police suspect a case of mistaken identity and foul play involving Rachel as the perpetrator  Rachel was so drunk that night  she can t remember a thing  but she has a sinking feeling she did something really awful  You ride along as Rachel tries to piece together what really happened that night    photo by Gail Albert  A lot of readers are comparing this book to Hitchcock s  Rear Window   because of the mysterious and voyeuristic way Rachel observes unsuspecting people through the windows of their homes  I agree  I can t wait to see how they visually translate this book to film  If you are in the mood for a great psychological thriller  don t miss this one  LOVED this book  Couldn t stop reading it  So well written and suspenseful  Loved it   I enjoyed this very original story which I downloaded on audio book for my morning commute to work  There was something very surreal about listening to The Girl on the Train as I travelled to work  allowing my own train journey to draw me into the lives of Rachael  Megan and Anna  Rachel s character was written in great depth  so much so I found myself liking her despite all her self imposed problems and insecurities I got through this book very quickly and it kept me captivated throughout  The only thing I will say is that this is not my normal genre and I usually read fast paced crime thrillers or Stephen King novels  I m not sure this book would have kept my attention as well if I had bought it in paperback form  and it was partly due to the fantastic narration that it kept me listening into the wee hours  I would recommend to anyone wavering between audiobook and paperback to go for the audio version  The plot was good  I guessed the ending three quarter ways through but this is not your classic whodunnit  to me it s all about the characters and how their relationships interact  develop and change as their worlds collide  There was a lot of hype surrounding this book and it is very well deserved  It s very cleverly written and I look forward to reading more from this author in the future  5 StarsGreat read   I rarely give 5 Stars but this book totally deserves it  I loved the plot  a very sad  lonely  drunk  yet sympathetic woman cannot seem to let her ex husband go and move on with her life  She certainly has reason to be angry with him  he dumped her for another woman  but 2 years later she is still obsessed to the point of losing everyone and everything in her life  At times you really feel for her but other times you just want to shake her and tell her to get over it  One drunken night  while she  Rachel   acts on an impulse and decides to show up at her ex husband s house  she finds herself in the middle out of a missing persons investigation  The story is told alternately between the points of view of Rachel  Anna  former mistress  current wife of Rachel s ex  and Megan  missing women   As the plot unfolds  we find out more about each woman  their lives  histories and motives  We also realize how little people really know about others and how outside impressions can be very deceiving  While reading this book  I didn t really find myself reflecting on the writing style  To me  that means it was written seamlessly for the story  The book was easy to get hooked on  I couldn t put it down once I got started  The ending was not what I had expected  Although the  bad guy  was one of several on my list  I really didn t figure it out until very near the end  I highly recommend reading this book  I d love to hear others thoughts on it  It would make a great book club read    I loved The Girl on the Train  It s much more than a who done it  although it is a fabulous one  Rachel  the main character and narrator  takes the same train into and out of London every day  A couple  who she soon nicknames Jason and Jess  catch her attention  and she enjoys seeing what they do every day when they have breakfast and an early evening drink on their terrace  They seem to have the ideal happily married life  She becomes fiercely protective of them even though she has never met them  One day she sees that something seems to have gone terribly wrong with Jess  and she decides it is her job to warn Jason  Only before she gets up the guts to warn Jason  whose real name is Scott  Jess  whose real name is Megdan  turns up murdered  and her face is plastered across the newspapers  front pages   Rachel  named by a main character as a sad  no life alcoholic  inserts herself into the police investigation  in part because she has some personal business of her own down the street from the couple s home  However  she also has seen something in a drunken stupor that she senses is key to the police investigation  only she can t remember what  Although Rachel s obsessiveness with the murder and her alcoholism should have been toned down  the depiction of her poor self esteem is right on target  Reading her detailed thought process and her interaction with the other characters shows excellent writing  The plot twists and turns many times  and each time I had to put down the book  I was excited to get back to it  I knew what the end was gonna be  who done it  about 100 pages beforehand  but I still loved getting there  Yes  about 50 100 pages could have been easily deleted  but it still was great  I mean  one doesn t dislike  Gone with the Wind  because the movie is four hours long  Right   I was really on the fence about whether to give this book 4 or 5 stars  In the end I opted for 5  because I enjoyed it as much as most of the  relatively few  books that I ve rated 5 stars  But please  Paula Hawkins  learn what a semicolon is for  and use them as needed  Non riuscivo a smettere di leggerlo e l ho finito in una giornata La storia vista da tre donne  ognuna diversa dall altra L investigazione e assolutamente assente  e tutto solo nella testa della protagonista  e lei che pensa  che riflette  che cerca di ricordare  che va in giro per la citta a racimolare indizi  che cerca di capire che cosa sia successo  E anche se verso la fine capisci cosa e successo veramente ancora prima che lo racconti lei  e proprio questo il bello  che tu conosci la verita ancora prima che la protagonista lo ammetta a se stessa  ed e come se le dicessi  stai attenta  non andare li  no  non farlo    This is a page turningly  sleep losingly suspenseful story  It reminded me a little of  Gone Girl  with shrewd use of the unlikable and unreliable narrator  Great read for mystery lovers  I m new to psychological thrillers  and thrilled  ha ha  no pun  to have read this book as my first foray into the genre  I listened to the book on Audible and enjoyed every second  I am going to dissect why that is  because I didn t like any of the characters in this book and that s interesting  don t you think Why would a book captivate our attention when we dislike everyone in the story  I haven t read Gone Girl  yet  but I do agree with one of the Goodreads reviewers in that none of the characters in this book were likable to me  What I loved was the powerful slowly unfolding story telling  the gripping  captivating way the author carries you along  leaving you absolutely no choice but to go with her  You simply have to know where this leads  what happens  and in the process  you are willing to put up with the unlikable Anna  the selfish  self centered Megan  and the drunk  over apologetic  and yes  at times  pathetic Rachael and the nervous anxious and overly concerned Tom  Okay perhaps I liked Kamal  the shrink  Yes  he was the least unlikable and the more sentimental character  and most of the time  he was doing the right thing Anyway  this to me says that curiosity is a stronger driver for knowledge than emotional attachment  Either way  I devoured this book in one week  I listened carefully and enjoyed the three narrative voices so much that I couldn t bring myself to speed up the audio to even 1 25x even though I was dying to move forward on the story  Girl on the Train  was satisfying from start to finish and here are the things that Paula Hawkins did extremely well   Chilling start  One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl  A nursery rhyme that is running through Megan s mind   Three points of view  We have Anna  Rachael  and Megan  although primarily Rachael  unfolding the story for us one tiny layer of onion at a time  and this she   the author   did extremely well   The depiction of sorrow  depression  abandonment  shame  jealously and how that all manifests itself in self harm  in this case drinking   The assumptions people naturally make about one another from the outside  and how that rarely if ever matches up to reality   The fascinating way in which Rachael gets herself tangled up in the lives of strangers and past relationships   The whole science around blacking out and memory loss   The writing is exquisite  I enjoyed reading a current  2013  themed book for a change Sadly  this is the kind of book you read just once  and it s so very good the first time around  Don t read any plot spoilers  grab the audio version and hey  if you re about to embark on reading this  I m envious  Maybe I should read  Gone Girl  next  What do you think  Brilliantly written  While reading  you can totally relate to the feelings that Rachel goes through  You ought to feel sorry for her  The end of the story literally makes your jaw drop and makes you think  oh my  This has been it       Also  many people didn t like it as much as I did  I lovvvvvveed it  especially after reading  Pretty Girls  by Karin Slaughter  Different people different tastes  Peace  Everywhere I looked on our Spring break vacation  people were reading this book  And I suspect those reading on Kindle and tablet were doing the same  I loved it  I don t typically pick up thrillers  Only occasionally when I hear a lot of people talking about a book  will I voluntarily pick one up  And this one had a lot of buzz  I loved this book because I didn t like any of the characters  It sort of reminded me of Olive Kitteridge in that regard  But the book was nothing like that one  Can one call it a page turner when you read on a Kindle  It was a button pusher or a screen swiper  Didn t quite keep me guessing until the end  but I sure did want to race through  Heart pounding fabulous       Its only January but my favorite read this year so far       RCS  So good  Now    how to stay spoiler free Heard a lot about  The Girl On The Train  being another  Gone Girl   which actually put me off choosing it for a while  Glad I downloaded it  because it was so much better  The characters   with one notable exception   were sympathetic  They were complicated because of their beliefs  weaknesses  and misunderstandings  not because they were bat guano crazy Figured out who the  bad guy  was fairly early on  but was on the edge of my seat to find out exactly how it was all going to come out into the open  I read this book almost a year ago and I still think about it   The Girl on the Train  is either a book you will either love or hate  it s just one of those kind of books because it was so popular  I really liked how real and flawed Rachel was  She s a depressed  overweight  lonely  unemployed alcoholic still nursing romantic feelings for her cheating ex husband  Tom  Rachel is NOT perfect which made her such a relatable and honest protagonist  I also enjoyed reading about Megan s traumatic past and turbulent present  She was another character that wasn t cookie cutter or predictable  she was full of inner conflict and self loathing  And as for Anna  well   she was a stone cold bitch but hey  at least she didn t pretend to be somebody she wasn t   warts and all  I really loved the emotion I felt when I read this book  Women are complicated creatures  I think we should embrace that truth and not criticize or run from it  A gripping psychological thriller  Enjoy   First and for most I must say WOW just WOW this book was a roller coaster ride  Ive never read a book where the main character is constantly intoxicated  This book is a must read I do have to say it takes about 5 chapters to really get into the book  Once you get into the story it all starts to piece together quite nice  I love the fact that this book has you pinned you want to find out who did what etc   I was not expecting the twist at all   Did not see it coming at all   If you are a fan of Gone girl you will deff love this book by far it kept me on my toes  I could not put this book down as I finished it in 2 days  I needed to get to the bottom of the story  I had to know who did it  Thank you Paula for writing such a beautiful masterpiece    5 5 Books do not come any better than Girl on the Train  The plotting  the pacing  the characters  all of it  flawless  I was hooked from page one  read it practically in one sitting  and I see why so many people love it  Like Stephen King said  Hawkins nails that alcoholic narrator and uses the device to perfection  GOTT  like Gone Girl before it  is a perfect blend of literary and popcorn thriller  Simply put  a masterpiece  If you liked Gone Girl you will love The Girl on the Train  The similarities are there   most obvious in the switching of viewpoints from one chapter to the next  Rachel drinks too much and is never sure of what she s done or what she thinks she remembers  Anna is her ex husband s current wife  Megan is the perfect  beautiful neighbor  The scene is set  the mystery begins and off we all go  Expertly crafted  it is hard to put this one down  even though you may figure out what s coming  I felt for each of these women as the tension built and they shared their stories  All in all  a satisfying read   one that was hard to put down   If I could give this 4 5 stars I would  but I rounded up  I thought the book was thrilling and suspenseful  The descriptions of Anna s drinking made me cringe  Which shows how well it was written  that I could really feel what these characters were going through  The lack of characters made me think the killer had to be someone we knew already  but it kept me guessing  Some parts bothered me  but I won t nitpick  I could not read this fast enough  Brilliantly written and delivered  Loved how flawed the characters were and the three narrator format  Wow  OMG  So far  it s the best suspense novel I ve read this year  It does start out a little slow  but once the narration moves from Rachel to the other characters  the speed of the novel picks up like a traveling train  bits and pieces begin to fall into place  and then you see the ending coming like a train wreck and cannot stop reading because you have to know how it end and most importantly   why What I loved  The red herrings  the misdirection   all brilliant ploys to disguise the truth What I didn t love  Rachel is not the most sympathetic of main characters for over half of the novel and it is hard to warm up to her  but I understand the author s purpose within the story for making her so unlikable  What I learned  You never really know a person Overall Grade  A I couldn t put it down  I ve only marathoned my way through books on three occasions  reading The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  The Martian by Andy Weir and now After reading a couple of YA novels I really needed a good dose of more mature writing and this book is beautifully written and captivating  Collins narration is extremely vivid and I can t help but to fully immerse myself in the book   I included a small excerpt from the book at the end  Paula Hawkins manages to make you feel hate  love  disgust and pride towards the characters all at the same time  The characters in this book feel extremely realistic  They are multidimensional and have believable character development  The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins and The Martian by Andy Weir are definitely my top choices for 2015  It s a glorious evening  warm but not too close  the sun starting its lazy descent  shadows lengthening and the light just beginning to burnish the trees with gold  The train is rattling along  we whip past Jason and Jess s place  they pass in a blur of evening sunshine   Excerpt From  Paula Hawkins   The Girl on the Train    The Girl on the Train is a best selling novel by British author Paula Hawkins  The novel debuted at number one on the The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers of 2015 list dated February 1  2015  It was the first book recommended by a book group promoted by the ITV television programme  Loose Women  Coleen Nolan  the singer of The Nolan Sisters fame suggested this book  I had not read anything by Paula Hawkins  but the title caught my interest Although Paula Hawkins was born in Harare  Zimbabwe  on 26 August  1972  she now She was educated at Oxford University  Oxford  England and now lives in London  She worked as a journalist for many years before writing The Girl on the Train which is her first thriller  although it is her fifth novel  The earlier works are romantic fiction written under the pseudonym  Amy Silver  The Girl on the Train has sold more than 120 000 copies in hardback since January  and sales of ebooks and copies in other countries are at around 2m  The US market has taken to it especially   the book has been at the top of the New York Times bestseller list for 13 weeks  and the film rights have been bought by DreamWorks  In The Girl on the Train  Rachel  the  girl  in the title is a divorced woman in her 30s who staggers along  unsteady and unsure  On her daily  morning commute  the train always stops at the same signal and Rachel starts to become obsessed with the couple whose garden backs on to the train tracks  They have  she believes  a perfect life  Rachel  herself  is being sucked under by alcoholism and the heartbreak of her failed marriage  However  she is shocked by something she sees in the couple s garden one day  Shortly afterwards  the woman goes missing and Rachel becomes entangled in their lives for real  This is complicated by the fact that she suffers from blackouts and memory loss  and is such a mess that neither the police nor the woman s husband can trust what she says  The Girl on the Train is more than a straightforward crime thriller  at its heart are the threats  pressures and judgments made on women  These include  domestic violence to ageing and to how they approach motherhood  Although there is a murder and the victim is female  it does not feel like the gratuitous  sexualised murders of attractive young women that pile up in so much crime fiction  It is a beautifully crafted book  I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would  so  if you enjoy a good thriller  I highly recommend The Girl on the Train  Valerie Penny I listened to the audio book with my husband  We thoroughly enjoyed this book  At first we were confused with all the different characters narrating but once we sorted it out we became engulfed in this mystery  Loved the ending and loved the story   very exciting While I cannot say I really liked any of the characters in this book  I did like the book  I read it in three days  so I would say it is a fast read Oh  and how ironic I was so into it  I almost missed my stop on the subway seriously  How well can we trust our memories  Can we really know another person  Two questions to ponder as the story of a woman s disappearance slowly unfolds  Told from multiple viewpoints we have to decipher the truth based on some very unreliable narrators  I can see this one being a popular pick with readers   Very clever and suspenseful  I did not see the twist coming  The characters were flawed but compelling  Rachel Watson is the girl on the train  She is there every day because she is trying to keep up appearances of being at work and valuable to someone after being dumped by her husband  Tom  He dumped her because she is a boozer  gin and tonic in a can is her drink of choice  but he didn t wait very long before hooking up with Anna whom he subsequently married  Tom and Anna live in the house Rachel used to share with Tom and  as the train passes each day  Rachel is able to get a glimpse of their new life as she passes by  Needless to say  it s like tearing the scab off an old wound every time she sees them  It s made clear that Rachel is still in love with Tom  though it is certainly not reciprocated  One couple she sees each day in her stupor she idealizes and even re names as Jess and Jason  Things start to go off the track one day when she sees Jess lip locked with a guy who is NOT Jason  The idyllic relationship she has created for her couple is thus shattered  We discover that  far from ideal  the marriage between  Jess and Jason  is not solid and Jess  aka Megan  is coming apart thanks to Megan s love for her therapist  As Megan disappears  and her husband  Scott  despairs  Rachel tries to inject herself into the investigation surrounding her disappearance  Unfortunately  when she does try to help she is often in an alcoholic stupor which makes her a less than reliable witness or informant  Rachel uses the investigation as a form of therapy for herself but she can t escape the confusion alcohol brings and she ends up trying to kidnap Tom and Anna s baby  This is a pathetic act  brought about in part by alcohol and partly from the fact that Rachel is sterile and frustrated for many years because of it  Adding to the complexity is the fact that Megan  being out of work and at loose ends  becomes nanny to Tom and Anna s baby and  unfortunately for her  Tom s mistress  Tom has strong sperm and they soon attack Megan s womb and she becomes pregnant  Scott discovering that he is not the father  One of the odd factors of the book comes to light gradually  nobody seems offended by anything that the others do  There is little blame placed though there is much to go around  Perhaps too much  What started as a dreamy mash up of  Peyton Place  and  Rear Window  turns into its own type  a demented thriller that has enthralled millions from this first time author  A complex but very satisfactory read  This book is written in the point of view of three of the characters in the story  Mainly it is written by Rachel  a divorced woman who imploded and spiraled into drinking and depression  Fired from her job  she continues to ride the train to and from work daydreaming about the people she sees from her train window  I don t want to give too much away  It took me longer than normal to  get into  the book  but once I did I couldn t put it down  I was very VERY surprised by the ending  Certainly didn t see it coming   A highly enjoyable thriller that keeps you guessing right up until the end   This is one of those books that I was thinking about even when I wasn t reading it  My go to book when I was waiting in lines or at the doctor s office  that would engross me to the point where I would forget I was waiting for anything at all   Unlike that book on my nightstand that I glance at and get that surprised  oh yeah  I m reading that  I should finish that sometime    The Girl on the Train demands your attention and is very hard to put down When I first picked up the book I was angry that the flap on the inside cover let me know the narrator was unreliable  But then when I started reading  I realized that myself within the first handful of pages  This will probably be one of my favorite books of the year  where the reader is invited to see the ending of the story and watch how it unraveled in a sort of drunken stupor that makes you vow to never drink again by the end of the book   Not a hard vow for me  as I m not a drinker  but dang  this book is enough to make anyone long for sobriety   I was annoyed at Rachel way too often  I hated most of the characters  Yet I couldn t stop  And I refuse to tell more about it here as there are enough spoilers in the reviews already So yeah   worth reading for many reasons   This was a stunning thriller  It captivated me in tone rather like The House of Mirth by Edith Wharton  a favorite book of mine  That sad spiral downward that I didn t want to travel with the character  but so well written  so intimate in voice  that I couldn t help myself  I kept thinking   No  Rachel  No  Don t do it     when she d be about to repeat a bad decision   Don t you ever learn   I hung on to the end  hoping that she would become the hero of her own story  with my doubts growing  Some of the situations were difficult for this  usually  cozy mystery writer  But they all supported the story  adding to the angst of both characters   reader  Hat s off to Paula Hawkins  What a stellar first novel  Congratulations  Loved it    Never wanted to read a book so fast to get to the end  Very good novel of suspense Wow   from page one this book grabbed my attention and didn t let go  Hawkins  characters are so flawed that it was almost too painful to read their chapters  The author did an excellent job keeping me guessing until the later half of the book when I saw where the story ending was headed  This is a gripping story full of angst  pain  anger  dysfunction  If you re looking for a feel good reading experience this isn t it  but if you re looking for a story that rips your gut open and doesn t let you go until the very end then this is your book  Great murder mysteryRead entire book in 24 hours  Story is told from each lead female characters point of view  Very clever and a worthy read  Este livro que esta ha 8 semanas em primeiro lugar na lista de best sellers do New York Times  http   goo gl zww74   e um suspense eletrizante  que atica curiosidade  que nao deixa vc largar o livro enquanto nao souber o final Incrivel porque e o primeiro livro dessa moca do Zimbabue  Paula Hawkins  que vive em Londres desde os 17 anos A Editora Record

unforgettable It begins slowly but once more information is discovered the roller coaster ride begins and you cannot get off of it until you find out who done it  Female characters are damaged and untrustworthy and the males appear to be strong and protective but then things turn upside down Wonderful book  no wonder it on the best seller list  My highest recommendation to all  Dont compare this to Gone Girl the story  Its the same genre of mind eff for sure though But not the same This was well thought out story  She left you thinking it was one person on one page and another person a few pages later  It was a fun train ride for sure  Non guarderete piu fuori dal finestrino con gli stessi occhi   Recensione presente anche sul blog  http   gillyinbooksland blogspot it 2    Il caso editoriale piu esplosivo del 2015  cosi reca la fascetta sul romanzo     La Ragazza del Treno e stato definito un vero e proprio  page turner  ovvero che ti spinge  in parole povere  a girare pagina  andare avanti nella lettura compulsivamente e per quanto mi riguarda non potevano trovare termine piu adatto Una volta cominciato infatti mi e stato letteralmente impossibile staccarmene e considerando che non appartiene al mio genere preferito  e veramente incredibile     non me l aspettavo Cio che mi ha spinto a leggerlo e stato il fatto che anche a me e capitato spesso di viaggiare in treno  piu negli anni passati che ora  e anche io  come Rachel  mi chiedevo come fosse la vita delle persone che incontravo in viaggio  oppure di chi era in macchina sulle autostrade che spesso costeggiano i binari  oppure di chi vive nelle case sempre nei pressi dei treni  Certo     non sono mai arrivata ad attribuire nomi fittizi o a concentrarmi piu volte sulle stesse persone ma capisco perfettamente quanto la mente possa vagare e giocare di immaginazione quando non si ha nulla da fare     se poi si considera che Rachel ha un motivo piu che valido per soffermarsi su quella casa e sulla via su cui essa sorge si capisce ben presto l ossessione della ragazza Ad ogni modo si tratta di un thriller e non voglio rivelare nulla per non rovinare il piacere della lettura    Rachel e una ragazza un po  borderline con un serio problema con l alcol e durante i suoi quotidiani viaggi in treno verso Londra si ritrova ad osservare la vita all interno di una casa in particolare fino a che  un giorno  i suoi occhi vedono un qualcosa che la scuote nel profondo     e della trama non rivelero piu nulla  Quella Rachel se ne frega delle conseguenze  e in preda a deliri di ottimismo oppure accecata dall odio  Non ha un passato e nemmeno un futuro  vive soltanto nel momento  Rachel pero non e l unica voce narrante del libro  Ne La Ragazza del Treno infatti tre donne si contendono la scena e le loro storie per quanto diverse e strutturate su livelli temporali diversi si ritroveranno a percorrere lo stesso binario che ci condurra verso il finale Paula Hawkins ha scritto un libro davvero particolare e avvincente  Complice uno stile decisamente semplice sono stata trascinata a forza dentro il libro e dentro la storia di queste tre donne diverse ma inesorabilmente legate da un destino terribile     tre donne apparentemente comuni ma che solo pian piano  particolare dopo particolare  si apprende quanto sia complicata e unica la loro vita Vorrei dire e aggiungere altro ma rischierei di rovinare quel finale che invece dovete gustarvi sorso dopo sorso    Percio mettervi comodi  salite sul treno e preparatevi al piu particolare e avvincente dei viaggi perche una volta arrivati a destinazione non guarderete piu fuori dal finestrino con gli stessi occhi  I loved it  I m glad I stuck through the first 100 pages because it just got better and better  It reminded me of a Hitchcock movie   Wow  What a terrific vacation read    thank you Tammy Siegel  Kept my attention from beginning to end  Great psychological thriller with plenty of twists and turns I love birthdays  You get stuff you probably would never buy for yourself  My son gave me an iTunes gift card for my recent birthday  And  in anticipation of a long solo drive  I purchased this book on audio  Audiobooks are not cheap and you have to be careful what you choose  Or you could end up falling asleep at the wheel  However  this particular book is ideal for the audiobook medium as it is entirely in first person with both of the main characters  Rachel and Megan  relating their interior monologues  And because it is in first person  you get the feeling  as it is read to you  that the characters are actually speaking to you  Thus there is an instant and personal connection  Plus  this is a compelling story of Rachel  an alcoholic voyeur with an active imagination  building a story in her mind about a couple  Megan and Scott  Rachel watches this couple  who live in a house on the tracks of a commuter train Rachel rides each day  Then we get to hear Megan s side of the story  I won t give it away because it took me by surprise  It also helps that the three actors reading the story have amazing voices  This is a rather sad and depressing story but some of the take away lessons and insights are worth the read listen  however you choose to enjoy this book  Wonderful and original thriller and makes you think how many people while away their daily commute    though the heroine s is not exactly a normal one    with creative thoughts to ease the daily boring grind of the journey  Heroine s character may well strike a chord with male and females alike in her battle with drink and the awful realisation of the downward spiral and the loss of memory etcetra  embarrassment and on and on  All the characters are well drawn and I would gladly recommend it to all  with a fantastic unexpected climax   although I guessed the killer halfway through    but that is no criticism  Terrific   I m currently listening to  rather than reading  The Girl on the Train but I can t resist writing a review  It is being compared  a LOT  to Gone Girl and fair enough there are some similarities I guess  However  as much as I loved Gone Girl  I really love this  The protagonist is superb and much different to anything I ve come across before  I recommend that if you haven t yet bought it  buy the audio version  as the reading is fantastic and listening to this book is enthralling  I keep overrunning on tasks such as cleaning my teeth in order to not stop  If you re hesitating don t  Buy it  Unexpected I didn t expect to like this one so much  It had so many emotions in it  You can t help but loathe and yet feel sorry for Rachel s condition  I loved the story told between the 3 women  Great unexpected ending  Can t wait for the movie  Fan fucking tactic  A thriller to keep you glued to the book from the moment you open it to the end of it  I found some similarities to  Gone Girl  and I can totally see this one being made into a movie too  I d absolutely watch it    I have heard many people compare this book to Gone Girl  I really liked Gone Girl  but even that book didn t get five stars from me  The Girl on the Train did  I am stingy with that fifth star  so this shows how much I enjoyed this book   The Girl on the Train is the story about a woman named Rachel struggling with alcoholism and is still trying to come to grips with her failed marriage  She spends much of her time riding a commuter train back and forth from her apartment to a job she no longer has  During the trips  the train frequently stops at a signal where Rachel can look upon a house just a few doors down from where she used to live  At this house  she watches a couple and believes they have the dream life  She knows nothing about them  but has built the story of their life in her own mind  She soon learns more about them then she ever expected and becomes embroiled in a mystery  Despite knowing her shortcomings  she just cannot resist getting more involved than she should  Author Paula Hawkins captures the personalities of her characters brilliantly  The book is told entirely from the first person perspective  but the perspective shifts between three different women  While that might sound like it could get confusing  it was actually quite easy to distinguish the three different characters  They led very different lives and had their differing personalities  It was very interesting to read how Rachel saw an event  and then see how one of the other characters saw it  The viewpoints told different stories and did a good job of preventing me from solving the mystery too quickly  I figured out what had happened earlier than I expected  but I realized that was probably Hawkins  intent  Thanks to the knowledge  I got to join in the feeling of dread as I watched the characters walk into trouble I knew was coming  The first person narrative also allows the reader into the heads of these people  That was especially important for getting to know Rachel  The woman was very screwed up  That would have been obvious even if it was told from the third person  but by making it first  you got to read the mental ramblings  the broken reasoning  the frustration  and pain straight from her mind  The reader can feel just how screwed up Rachel has become because of her past  There are times you just want to shake some sense into her as she continually does things that screws up her own life  but creates trouble for those around her  While she intended to help  she proved to be very unhelpful throughout the story and gets herself deeper and deeper into trouble  Hawkins  pacing of this story was perfect  You get to know Rachel quickly and see the monotony of her life from the opening pages  But you feel the tension as well  The tension grows fast as she witnesses something she never wanted to see  The mystery unravels in a way to where you just cannot resist turning to the next page  Because I am usually a late night reader with a day job that requires me out of bed early  I had to force myself to put the book down and crash several times during the week I read it  But as the pace picked up  my reading sessions grew longer  my desire for sleep grew less  I read the final 80 pages in one marathon read  a marathon for me anyway  because the race to the climax was too good to stop  This is a must read for any fans of Gillian Flynn  Even if you aren t  or have never read Flynn s book  I strongly recommend this one  There are only two other books to which I would consider five star books  very  very goodI spent 90  of this book with my head spinning with trying to figure out what was going on  I love that  I m a librarian  so I see lots of booklists and read plenty of reviews  I knew that  The Girl on the Train  was a book I would be reading as soon as it was delivered in our next book shipment  This book did NOT disappoint  I absolutely devoured it in about three days  and that s only because I couldn t devote every waking moment to it   I simply couldn t put it down  Here s the crazy part    I figured things out about halfway through the book and still couldn t put it down  That s how much of a page turner it was for me  Rachel is a young British woman who rides the commuter train to work in London each day just like clockwork   the 8 04 train in the morning and the 5 56 train in the evening  During her daily commute  she sees the same houses and people outside her seat s window at a certain signal stop and begins to feel like she knows them  Well  that is  she knows them via the fictional life she has made up for them in her mind  she s even given them names and occupations    So  she sees  Jess   Jason  each day on their deck and they are the perfect couple   in fact  they remind her of the REAL life she used to have just a few doors down from them in the same neighborhood not too many years ago  However  Rachel no longer has that perfect life  In fact  her ex husband  new wife  and baby girl still live in that house  which is also a source of pain on her daily train ride  One day on her commute  she witnesses something at Jess   Jason s house that would suggest they don t have the perfect life either  This new information consumes Rachel and she feels she needs to help  but Rachel has problems of her own and perhaps she s not seeing things clearly  Due to some deep seated personal demons  Rachel has become her own worst enemy  Would authorities believe her if she came forward  Is it even a good idea to get involved  Are  Jess   Jason  even close to who she s dreamed up in her head  The story is told from the perspective of the three women in the book   Rachel   Megan  Jess s real name    and Anna  the woman who stole Rachel s husband away from her   It s hard for me to believe that this is the author s first book  Paula Hawkins does an incredible job of weaving these three women s stories together in this suspenseful thriller  This is one of those books that leave me sad because it s over  I hope Ms  Hawkins is already busy on her second novel  I m ready to put it in a future library order     The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  finished 2 11 15   Note to Self  Do  not  start what you know to be a page turner novel two days before one is to have dinner company  and four days before one is to present a big concert  Worried that I d have to feed my guests delivery pizza    or that my audience would enter to an empty stage  I was compelled to finish this book in less than 24 hours  that s my excuse and I m sticking to it       First of all  it employs my favorite literary device  alternating narrators  swoon   The writing is fast paced  the characters  human frailties and feelings are believable  and the plot zig zags just often enough to keep you guessing  but not so much as to make you dizzy  Hollowness  that I understand  I m starting to believe that there isn t anything you can do to fix it  That s what I ve taken from the therapy sessions  the holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mold yourself through the gaps  I did feel as if I d figured it out with about 100 pages to go  but maybe she meant to do that  such that I was feeling quite clever  but was really only being manipulated  I daresay  Britishspeak  it s the new Gone Girl  and I mean that in the best possible way    This is an amazing book  I was guessing the whole way through  I loved the characterizations and switching narrators  Wow  Comparisons to Gone Girl due to subject matter but the more fair comparison is in how this is a page turner that you can t put down  When you read for leisure  you do it to entertain yourself  When you read for school  it s to learn and get a good grade on a test  Sometimes leisure reading can provide both entertainment and education  sometimes it just provides entertainment  This book provides entertainment and it did its job well  Sometimes we just need to read for the pleaser of reading and not be so critical of the way a book was written  This book was not meant to be part of an English literary class  it was just meant to entertain and it did  I loved it  This one I finished at the speed of light partly because it s unputdownable  partly because I didn t have to stop every few sentences to proofread or correct usage in my head  Kudos to the author on her winning debut effort and to Penguin for their ongoing commitment to quality  How rare professional copyediting has become in the publishing industry  I really liked this one and I especially enjoyed the ending  truly vindication for Rachel  Well written  and  though a little slow in the beginning  it was really quite a fun ride Quotes Cathy s a nice person  in a forceful sort of way  She makes you notice her niceness   I can t get comfortable  because every way I turn I run into dead ends  the closed gallery  the houses on this road  the stifling attentions of the tedious pilates  the track at the end of the garden with its trains  always taking someone else to somewhere else  reminding me over and over and over  a dozen times a day that I m staying put  ReflectionThis one is still weighing on my mind   wow  Just such an edge of your seat ride  I kind of want to read it again  And I don t usually re read books  Amazing  Everything about it is amazing from the characters and their personality  or should i say personalities  that are cleverly chosen  to the plot that is intriguing  to the style of the author  I loved how she tells the story from different perspectives  Each chapter would be from a different person s view  The reader will try to resolve the mystery and analyses to find the killer  gathering every piece of information available to be surprised at the end     i will not give a spoiler   You should read the book to find out  I enjoyed every detail in it  I m not sure what I expected but this was another great read  listen  for this month  I m on a roll   The audio was read by 3 different readers who were fine but I thought their voices were so similar that they were difficult to tell apart  This example of unreliable narration reminded me so much of Gone Girl but I liked this so much better  Rachel takes the train into London every day and every day she pays close attention to one house  The house is very close to where she used to live  before she and her husband broke up  and she loves to watch the young couple there having their breakfast  They seem to be a perfect couple  She has even named them  Jess and Jason  But one morning  she sees something she can hardly believe and soon nothing can stop her from entangling herself in something that can only go from bad to worse  This is the definitive book for helping you to remember to mind your own business      Rachel catches the same commuter train every morning  She can t help but stare into the gardens and windows of the houses that back onto the line  She knows the train will wait at the same signal every time  Same signal  Same train  Until she s sees something shocking  But I shouldn t be telling you too much about the plot  The author has perfectly structure the book to keep you guessing  keep you on your toes  It is unpredictable  which is what makes it one of the stand out thrillers of this year It s not just about the girl on the train  There s also the girl in the house and the new girl  Each chapter is told by one of these three women and at different periods of time  When you think you know what s happening  you re left in doubt as each narrator has their own version of events  No one can be trusted  Rachel is an alcoholic  Megan has tainted views of Rachel after being told stories from her husband  Anna is hiding something from everyone What was refreshing about this novel was how  normal  it all was  It s not the story of psychopath killing as many people as possible while being chased by a rouge cop with his own problems  Its flawed human beings making mistakes and bad choices  It s all behaviours we are also guilty of  Peeping in houses through the train windows  Painting your ex as a mad  bad  sad woman  We are capable of terrible crimes and we can also be victims just like the characters in this book  It s all too real The way in which I read The Girl on Train speaks volumes about how good it is  I was up until 4am  I had to know what was happening  I had to know the truth  As I said  there are many twists and turns and red herrings  All the clues are in front of you but everyone is coming to different conclusions  Everyone I ve spoken to has had their own theory  None were right  It s a testament to the brilliance of the book  It demands to be read and talked about  I wasn t quite sure what to expect from this novel as it entered the literary world with both a great deal of hype as well as comparisons to the hugely successful book  Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn I am delighted to say  this was a terrific read  Sharing more in common with Flynn s work than the use of  girl  in lieu of  woman in the title  such as the notion of unreliable narrator s  it s an original  dark and compelling story told from three female points of view  The primary narrator is Rachel  the  girl  on the train who  when travelling to and from her work daydreams about an apparently loving couple she sees for a few seconds each time the train pauses on its journey and who happen to live a few doors down from her old house  Inventing a life and even names for them  she invests heavily in her imaginary scenario so much so  one day  when she sees something that doesn t accord with her imagined view of their world  she is distressed  When she discovers the young woman she has named  Jess  is missing  she is compelled to uncover the truth of what she thinks she saw and what it might mean Things  however  are a little more complicated than a blurring of the lines between fact and fantasy  or adhering to the adage  seeing is believing   It just so happens Rachel was in the area the night the woman  whose real name is Megan  goes missing  Rachel knows something terrible has happened and she may have borne witness to events  The only problem is  Rachel is an alcoholic who has  blackouts  and cannot recall what occurred or even if anything did   But she has snatches of memory    snippets of images and very strong feelings that she cannot dismiss  Do they mean something or is it the drink playing tricks The other two narrators are Rachel s ex husband s new wife  the young mother  Anna  who lives a few doors down from the missing Megan  who is the third narrator   and in the same house Rachel used to dwell in and which represented such promise and happiness  until her marriage unravelled The three women s stories and  indeed  version of events  are all interwoven with Rachel s painful and desperate need to recall  interfere and discover what is true  what is not  and overcome her battle with the bottle and the demons of her past being dominant I don t want to give away too much about this plot because it is clever  There were times I thought  how on earth is Hawkins going to pull this off  There is no way I am going to be able to suspend my disbelief regarding this     But I did  The reader does  and that s because the flawed and oft times pathetic and frustrating narrators of this macabre tale are as believable and human as are the stupid  reckless and tragic decisions they make and the lives of those they draw into their stories and actions Light on police procedural  which is where I struggled a bit with some of the actions and behaviour of characters   this is far more a psychological thriller that plumes the depths of perception  of memory  of how we construct our lives  make excuses  accord blame  and reinvent ourselves in an effort to erase the past and shore up a future  It s how the same people can view an identical event in completely different ways and react accordingly It is also about manipulation  violence   emotional  psychological and physical   betrayal  of ourselves as well  and the impact this has on others Once I started this tale  I could not put it down and felt quite wrung out at the end  Like the train Rachel rides  you hop on board and find yourself hurtling towards a destination that even if you see it coming  the arrival is daunting and haunting A great and unexpected novel containing beautiful prose and some genuinely marvellous reflections on people and life  featuring weak and real characters embroiled in events that will chill and thrill  this is a cracker of a read  A chilling adult thriller with multiple disjointed  dated entries confuse and tantalize the reader  An unreliable narrator   Think  Gone Girl   Rachel  a divorced drunk  is sliding down a black hole of depression and self loathing  Though she lost her job months ago  she continues to  commute  daily on the train to London  She passes her former  happy home  on the way next to the tracks  It is now occupied by her ex  Tom  his wife  Anna  and their toddler  Evie  Also on Blenheim Rd  a few doors down are Megan   Scott  who appear to live an idyllic life  from Rachel s vantage point on the train  Then Megan goes missing  Rachel gets inextricably involved  and the mystery twists like a knife into your heart  Read it   I was thinking it may end up 4  but golly  the ending was amazing  I just finished the book and I m kind of speechless  One thing I noticed  the grammar was different  There s no problem in that  I just found learning the differences interesting through reading it  A well written book  vocabulary  literary devices  plot  etc    a first experience  according to my memory  of British grammar  not too different from American English   OK  now the actual contents of the book  Only recently have I been taking note of things such as where the author is from and if it is a debut  I think if debut novels are this good  someone give me a list  The dates subtitled in the story are important  well  some of them are  so I advise keep note of the dates and changes in time or confusion may arise  The story is told through three women  Rachel  Megan  Anna  Megan has quite the tale  Rachel was like my child  I felt proud when she stopped touching the alcohol  I liked how she connected the pieces of her memory and didn t get so offended being a terrible category of ugly  Sad  isn t it    One thing that slightly bothered was she calling  texting   visiting  her ex husband  Anna wasn t much of my favorite because she was like all for Tom and like I said  Rachel is like my child  The story mainly revolves around Rachel  Megan has more of a role in the story than Anna in terms of the story telling perspective  They have a lot of problems in their lives  exes and lust  insomnia and blackouts  lying and cheating  etc  etc  I liked that about the story for a reason I can t explain  There s the police and detective involved whom I did not like honestly  The men in this story besides the therapist  Scott and Tom    wow  Scott  Jason  wasn t my favorite character  Scott is Megan  Jess  s husband  The funny thing is how in  The Heroes of Olympus Series  I didn t like Jason  Scott did bother me a lot  I hated him for the paranoid way he acts  TOM  TOM  TOM  Oh  how happy I am you re damned in hell  This man is not just an ex husband of Rachel  husband of Anna  father of Evie  Oh  awaiting readers  you ll see what I mean   This story is all twists and turns  I m a perceptive person but this story is nearly impredictable  Some twists are nice though predictable  The last 60 something pages were mind boggling  That kept the story very interesting and I would be telling random people  OMG RACHEL WHY  I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO RACHEL   or     AND THEN SHE DIED AND RACHEL STOPPED DRINKING AND      Just all the twists made this story perfect  Of course  and the wonderful phrases and sentences far more than worthy to be recognized as quotes  Any few words can be quotes  This author s words were worthy of that  A wonderful debut thriller  I can certainly see why so many people love this book   Very clever suspense novel  I really enjoyed it   I avoided reading this one for a while because I was worried that its constant comparison to Gone Girl  a personal favorite of mine  would be untrue    which they were  Yes  this is a gripping thriller  and  yes this is a mystery but that is where the similarities end  While Amazing Amy is dazzling and brilliant  and undeniably brutal   Rachel  the titular girl on the train  is decidedly human  as are most of the characters who occupy this story  And what a story it is  I finished this one off in three days and hardly put it down  It s unsettling and spooky from the first page to the last  If you re a fan of thrillers that will leave you guessing  and second guessing your guesses  then I recommend reading this one ASAP   reviews can also be found on instagram at  rachaelreviews  nthyt mnh khll 6 s t rwy  mmt   wmshwq  llGy   Absolutely fantastic  Best book i ve read in years  Couldn t put it down  Done in 2 days  I loved this book  Rating  4 5 The girl on the train is told from the perspective of three different women  Rachel  Megan and Anna  and from different time periods 2012 and 2013  Rachel is the main character  who is alcoholic and takes the train everyday to work  Megan is the typical suburban housewife  and Anna is the most  sane  out of the three  and their lives is intertwined somehow    I enjoyed the writing  it was straightforward  but nothing fancy  i would have enjoyed it more if it was a bit more poetical with good quotes  but it wasn t bad  The character development was great  even the side characters had good development through out the book  I didn t figure out the twist easily  so props to Paula Hawkins for crafting such a good Thriller Mystery book  I would like to thank Transworld Publishing for approving me on NetGalley in exchange for a fair and honest review As you all know I m not a thriller reader  preferring chick lit or fantasy  I had heard so many wonderful comments about this book that I thought I would stick my toe in the world of thrillers and give this a read The story is told from the point of view of the three main female characters  Rachel  Megan and Anna Rachel is the main lead character but she isn t your typical main character  she is very flawed with so many problems that I wouldn t know where to start  she passes the same houses every day and gazes at a couple whose life she wishes she had  thinking everything is perfect   Jess and Jason s  life is far from the perfect picture in her head  catching a glimpse one day in passing takes Rachel on a voyage of discovery  not just about Jess and Jason but about herself  her past and her alcohol addiction I have read that someone found this hard to get into  what I found was that it is a little confusing to start offwith as it switches between main characters  and also years  this all becomes clear later in the book and it is a unique way of showing the background to a story without it being told to another character in the book  I ended where I really enjoyed how the story was told in this way  it was confusing but in a good way So what do I think of it  Especially given that I m not into reading thrillers  I did enjoy the story on the whole and the more I got into it I wanted to find out what had happened  I was gripped by the story and the twists and turns in parts had my head spinning Would I read any more thrillers  Yes  I would  This is a tense  gripping story that had me on the edge of my seat  I was intrigued with what would happen next always wondering who  An excellent debut and I will look out for more books by Paula  I think anyone that loves a good thriller will really enjoy this book  I m off back to chick lit and fantasy for now but will be dipping my toe in to more thrillers this year  Great thriller with highly dysfunctional  unlikable women characters  which I happen to like  which makes me think I should try writing thrillers instead of women s fiction  because  difficult women  happen to be my speciality   I usually guess what happens fairly early on but I did not with this until pretty late in the book  Quick read  too  I think people who were dismayed with the ending of GONE GIRL will find this one more satisfying  reminiscent of Gone Girl with a MUCH better ending  I enjoyed this one  And so the Gone Girl phenomena continues  When a theme hits and scores with the people  authors must milk it until it runs dry  huh  Just hope this doesn t turn into a Da Vinci Code thing because if so  it will loose all its glory On to the review Rachel commutes every day to London on the train  To pass the time  she looks out the window and looks at the houses she passes by  One in particular has her attention though  and she slowly starts to create a story for the couple she snoops on All is well and whatnot until she sees something unusual  It s that day she decides to start participating in the lives of this couple and it s that day everything starts going wrong  Very wrong I don t want to say anything more because I don t want to give anything else away because this is a book that needs to be read so you can find out the messed up story hidden in it  I will say though  that the character of Rachel is one of the most pathetic I have ever read  I can t express how much I dislike this woman  In my world  when a book makes you develop such strong feelings  be they good or bad  it is one fine written book I look forward to reading more by Hawkins and I deeply hope it won t be another Gone Girl emulation  OMG     alguma coisa me dizia que tinha sido aquela pessoa a culpada    Juro que nao estava a espera disto  De uma historia destas  Se no inicio eu estava a detestar as personagens  nao pela maneira como elas foram criadas  mas sim pela maneira de elas agirem umas com as outras  sempre cheias de mesquinhices e fraquezas  nao levou muito tempo a que eu ficasse simplesmente siderada por elas  O facto da narracao ser em trio  Rachel  Megan e Anna  ajuda imenso a que sejamos completamente absorvidas pelo que elas dizem  sentem  fazem e pensam  Sao tres personagens cheias de sentimentos contraditorios e cheias de emocoes reprimidas Opiniao Completahttp   sinfoniadoslivros blogspot pt     Creepy  but so good  Para quem gosta do genero  vale mesmo a pena ler este livro  Ao inicio  nao prende muito  mas a dada altura nao se consegue parar de ler  Muito bom  mesmo   From page one we feel sorry for protagonist Rachel  self professed alcoholic and all around loser  divorced  unemployed  living in a bedroom of an old school mate s apartment that is barely big enough to walk in  She has no money or life to speak of except for her daily train route  a pretense of still going in to work to keep her landlord at bay as finances continue to dwindle  On this commute  she passes by her old home  where she spent several happy years with her ex husband before her marriage  and mind  began to unravel  Now  watching these homes in her old neighborhood  she becomes obsessed with the lives she sees behind French doors and in sunny gardens along the rail track  the seeming utopian bliss she so desperately wishes to recapture  Through her typical boozy haze  she is caught off guard one morning when she sees a startling change in the status quo  which sets off a horrifying chain of events fraught with murder  deceit  and maddening twists of perception that leave the reader guessing until the very end  Engrossing and intelligent like Hitchcock s Rear Window  A Girl on the Train is a gripping thriller that will rob you of your ability to sleep until you discover the dreadful truth  The brilliant audiobook performances of Louse Brealey  India Fisher and Clare Corbett add thrilling new paranoia to your morning jogs in suburbia  Excelente thriller que te tiene sin aliento hasta la ultima pagina   Mereci disipas las buenas criticas recibidas por los medios americanos y britanicos   Sera una de las novelas de este verano   Well  well  well  May have just found the hot new darling of the crime novel scene   The Girl On The Train  is in works for a movie  which I can see as this is a very visual book  The new  Gone Girl  for 2015  And only her debut to boot  Now look  Now look what you made me do  is a creepy little opener to this fabulously un putdownable novel  The scene is set  the crime is underway  the tension is there  Hawkins is an ex journalist  and I can see how that career has seeped into this book as the writing is taught and snappy  One minute you think you may have sussed it all out  but the next page  that s all in the dust and you sit there thinking  like what the hell just happened there   We all know that Rachel  our main protagonist  is super flawed  an alcoholic with a crazy imagination  but we can t really trust  or like  the other two narrators of this tale  Anna and Megan  either  All three have issues  all three can be nasty little bitches  all three can be utterly charming at times  The tale of the unreliable narrator   who can we trust  if anybody at all  As Rachel  our train journeyer  states several times   something bad has happened  and she tries her best to help solve the crime  but can she trust her alcohol fuzzed memories  Hawkins kind of reminds me of Gillian Flynn  but I think Paula Hawkins is more fast paced with her plotting and writing  I really did enjoy  Gone Girl   and thought Rosamund Pike was superb as Amy in the movie adaptation  but actually prefer Flynn s novel  Dark Places  to  Gone Girl   though all three of her novels are a great read and gripping  This book was so hard to put down  and I didn t want it to end  For the movie  I can absolutely picture the wonderful Welsh actress Eve Myles in the role of Rachel  Highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good  gritty  super teeth crunchy crime book   The Girl On The Train  will twist your mind  make you think  try to nut it all out  and mistrust  The characters are flawed  creepy  nuts and I love it  Seems some reviews I ve read on GF are negative  they find this kind of book abhorrent  pathetic and the characters horrid   er  they are meant to be  This is real life  this shit DOES happen  horrible  of course  but it does as we see this crap on the News every day  and people DO act in these ways and can be extremely bloody nasty to each other  Life unfortunately is not a sweetshop and unicorns Anyway  please do yourself a favour and pick up this book right NOW  Looking forward to Paula s next novel   I know it s a bit trashy  and I had guessed the denouement before the end  but suffice to say I stayed up last night to finish it  and have read this in a matter of days whereas my previous book took me weeks  It is superior to  Gone Girl  in that the characters are at least mostly sympathetic to a degree  whilst I couldn t give a toss about any of the narcissists in  Gone Girl   Clever use of layered narrative  hello Wuthering Heights  and its distortion of perception  Definitely would recommend  especially now beach reads are upon us  I defy you not to at least find it intriguing    I listened to the audio recording of this story and loved everything about it  the tale  the characters  the writing  and the astounding performances of the three narrators  Well done  This novel is a magnetic thriller of two women  interconnected by thin threads of a secret one for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl  four for a boy  five for silver  six for gold  seven for a secret never to be told Rachel is a broken  wretched woman relying solely on alcohol to soothe the violent pangs of her misery but the drinking has left enormous holes in her memory  She is frightened by her own blackouts  unaware of what could have possibly happened last night or the night before that  I can feel the heat come to my face  my stomach a pit of acid  Yesterday  sensible  clearheaded  right thinking  I decided I must accept that my part in this story was over  But my better angels lost again  defeated by drink  by the person I am when I drink  Drunk Rachel sees no consequences  she is either excessively expansive and optimistic or wrapped up in hate  She has no past  no future  She exists purely in the moment   I want to drag knives over my skin  just so that I can feel something other than shame  but I m not even brave enough to do that This time  however  she has to to somehow remember what happened that dreadful Saturday night because there are no reminiscent tid bits of memory  only some physical evidence  Megan is another sufferer  She s an insomniac frequently suffering from panic attacks and excessive anxiety  Although  apparently she feels happy but she is not bone deep happy  Rather she is not contend with her present life   She is engulfed by a hollowness and a deep sensation of incompleteness    and my brain is going to keep racing round and round and I know I ve got a sleepless night coming  I can t just sit here  watching the trains  I m too jittery  my heartbeat feels like a flutter in my chest  like a bird trying to get out of a cage The ghosts of the past haunt both these ladies so much so that they find living in the present cumbersome  In their rather unstable frame of minds  they take some preposterous decisions and follow absurd pathways  often whispering of dangers ahead  The story is set in an suburban area of Whitney  the atmosphere of the area with undeveloped aura  passing trains  creaking their way every hour or so adds to the eerie atmosphere and thrill It is clear that the author knows her subject very well and has taken care of presenting each significant minute detail of her characters  The psychological aspects in the novel are expertly dealt with  What is more is that  she knows exactly where to draw the curtains over which details  The novel is a blast of emotions  shame  guilt  anger  solitude that the reader feels on behalf of the characters but not only these  there is a different set of feelings that one feels for the characters viz  pity  sympathy and fear  All this just proves intimate connection with the characters which is another excellent feature of this novel The pace is rather exciting  Indubitably  a phenomenal thriller which hooks you from the first page and doesn t let you relax until you ve turned the final page and discovered it all The Girl on the Train deals with how solitude and hollowness can make someone completely deranged and how  under such lonely circumstances  people can be open to attracted to anyone paying just the mildest bit of attention to them and how faulty can be decisions that such people take  Last but not the least  the writing is superb  a major player in keeping you entangled and lost in the story with the lucid description I simply loved this novel  in fact  it s the best that I ve read in a while  The girl on the train is desolation  abuse  blood  tethering on the edge of insanity  fear and a deep mystery that goes unpredictable  thus enjoyable  I d recommend it to everybody  Read it   Strong storytelling  complex characters  and a psychological depth that makes it exceptionally believable This is one of those rare crime books  it is one that could easily be read again  because it does not simply rely on the whodunit but on strong storytelling  complex characters  and a psychological depth that makes it exceptionally believable  It is a fascinating journey into the mind of Rachel  someone who is broken and flawed  who cannot trust anything that comes from anyone s mouth   not even her own If Rachel sounds awful  she is in good company  The other main narrators  Megan and Anna  aren t nice either  Megan hides a dark secret  Anna is cold and selfish  In fact  all the characters  the men included  lie  cheat  and manipulate  Yet the author has managed to also make them sympathetic and realistic  at no point do they turn into one dimensional caricatures But of all the liars  Rachel is the biggest  unable to trust her own memories as she battles with alcoholism  Even her daily commute on the train is a lie  as she lost her job months before  and travels in to ensure no one realises  It is from her train seat that she bitterly recalls how her life has changed  because each day she passes her old home  where she used to live with her husband  Tom  Now he lives in the same home  with his new wife A few doors down live a couple  Megan and Scott  who Rachel becomes obsessed with  And that obsession is about to shred her already torn life As recollections and half truths slide around Rachel s mind  as she examines bruises and tries to put together what is happening to her  she is also trying to solve the puzzle of what happened to Megan This is a skilfully told book  the three women each telling their take on the tale  each one different enough to make it clear that no one is reliable  Everything is constantly shifting  leaving the reader always wondering  just what is the truth This is a brilliant book  and incredibly complex and assured for a debut novel  Paula Hawkins has a bright future ahead of her  A great summer read   in AprilVery much enjoyed the story as it unfolded  and its narrative approach  A definite page turner that I am sure many will enjoy  WOW WOW WOW  What just happened   and omg what a story  If you love a good twisted crime novel  read this book now  I just can t put it down  very very interesting and fast paced   I thorougly enjoyed this novel  It started off slow and mainly concentrated on the main character  Gradually other characters were introduced and the novel moved a bit more quickly  The final third gained speed when the central mystery finally started to resolve itself until the very end when I could not stop reading  Sort of like a train  I sort of disliked the main character  alcoholic  but she grew on me  She was realistically portrayed as were the other characters in my opinion  After stating another novel right after this the writing was so awkward compared with Ms  Hawkins  That s when I realized that a good writer makes you forget that you are even reading  LOVED IT   hoping this novel turns into a film   If you liked Gone Girl  you will love this book  It s fast paced  mysterious and thrilling  I will definitely read the next book by Paula Hawkins  This was SO GREAT  I can t remember the last time I read a book in a few days  I couldn t put this book down  It was such a page turner that I was half way through the book by the second day  Who can you trust  In this book  I thought I trusted Rachel    She seemed like she had good intentions  but was living a very hard life  She was dealt a really horrible deck of cards  but was trying to get through it with some dignity    minus the alcohol  Anna    well  what can I say  She s every woman s worst nightmare  I hated her in this book  She was such a bitch and reading her parts of the book was the least enjoyable   at least for me  Megan   I didn t know what the hell was wrong with this girl  She had a very unfortunate life  but she was such a liar that I also had a really hard time liking her  This book was one of those books that I loved  but hated the characters  So    Who done it  Who was the person that made Megan disappear  Lets just say that there was a time where I had thought that every one of the characters had a part in her disappearance  In the beginning  I thought maybe it was Rachel    Then I thought maybe it was Scott or possibly Anna  I couldn t make up my mind on who it could be  Then  there was a certain part in the book in where I knew who it was    I m not going to say But  I am going to say that if you were on the fence about buying this book    GET OFF THE FENCE and RUN TO YOUR NEAREST BOOKSTORE  Get your hands on a copy of this book  I promise  you won t be disappointed  Happy Reading   Wow       I love books that I can t put down  As soon as I finished The Girl on the Train  I messaged my friends and told them to pick it up  I see the Gone Girl comparisons but unlike it  this moves so much faster and it leaves out a big chunk of unnecessary reading  Rachel the main character  not very likable  even heard myself calling her a Dumb      at times buttt can you blame the poor lady   She drinks  And the issues there are real  As much as we want her to stop drinking she knows it won t stop today  Maybe tomorrow  We learn quickly that she s alone  She longs to feel the touch of another person and the only thing close to that are the joys she experiences from riding the TRAIN The rides give her an inside look at the homes by the railroad   and that s where we meet Jesse   Jason through the perspective of alcoholic Rachel  Until one day it s not Jesse and Jason    it s Jesse and a new tall  dark  and   handsome man  Rachel feels betrayed  how can she do this   The feelings in her gut are all too familiar considering that the same thing happened to her  And it just so happens that Tom  ex  and his new wife  Anna live a few houses down  Happily  with their baby girl Suddenly we find out that Jesse is missing  Jesse is really Meagan  Another lost character that has a void to fill and does it by cheating on her husband  Scott  aka Jason   Rachel  knows she has a lover  and now feels the need to go and tell her husband and the police  Her credibility is not too good considering she s always harassing her ex and his wife  The lies that come pouring out this book are endless  It really goes to show that not everyone is who you think they are I think what I like the most is that Paula Hawkinscreated characters with such realistic personalities  The women in this book are flawed    searching and finding themselves in the wrong places  I had my guesses on to what happened to Megan but it was great seeing it develop through the perspectives of Rachel  Anna    Megan  I m a fan  I completely missed the hype on this one  I mean  I knew this was a book that existed  but I didn t know how popular it was  My mother is not a reader AT ALL  I d say she s read maybe two books in her lifetime  so when she asked me to borrow this book  I couldn t believe it  Unfortunately reading proved too much for her and she was unable to get through it  so I gave it to her in audio format  That was also not enough to keep her from falling asleep  so my mother has never read the book  That meant I had to read it  then tell her the short version I read the entire book in less than a day  It was utterly engrossing  The characters are completely horrid  yet I found myself intrigued by their stories  Told from multiple characters  perspectives  the mystery slowly reveals itself  with a few unexpected twists and turns I must admit that usually I am rubbish at guessing who the  bad guy  is  but in this tale  I found it rather obvious  It was obvious  view spoiler  because of the fact that all the characters had massive character flaws  except the one  who appeared downright normal in comparison  You just know he had to have the most skeletons in his closet   hide spoiler  As with most mysteries  the story could be summed up in one sentence  which I relayed to my mother  but these types of stories aren t about who done it  it s about how we got there  And this journey was very satisfying  I recommend this book to fans of mystery thrillers  Great read from a first time author  The book has been compared to Gone Girl because it s a thriller about a girl who has gone missing  I liked it better than Gone Girl  Very satisfying until the very end  Looking forward to her next book  WOW  Could not put it down  Stayed up WAY too late to finish this book  I can see why the library s waiting list for this book was so long  Well worth the wait Hawkins drew a well crafted thriller and at the same time  drew non judgmental attention to the issues of substance abuse and domestic violence  Telling two  and later  three  parallel stories of women s lives and their relations to the men around them  and how Rachel  Megan  and Anna deal with love and loss  Can t wait to see what else Paula Hawkins has written  I haven t read a book this deliciously fun in a long time  The story itself is interesting and kept me wanting more  but what really hooked me was the excellent characterization of the three lead characters  all women  btw   All three women are seriously flawed  their unreliable narration colored by personal bias and profound emotions  The writing style changes beautifully with each perspective switch  and this adds another layer of doubt for you the reader trying to sift through an already complex and suspenseful story  The tension is just right  each scene revealing just enough to tease you into reading the next chapter  and then the next  until the novels heart pounding  well earned and well crafted ending  Wonderfully written  fun to read and kept my attention the entire way through  I gobbled this one down in a day  I hope to read more from this author if her next books are anything like this one  I kept hearing about this book  how it was being compared to Gone Girl  This was no Gone Girl  This was Agatha Christie on crack  I literally could not put this book down until I finished it  Did I have an inkling of the ending  Sure I did  but only because this book is so similar in Christie s formula  But it s different  oh so different  The three different story lines converging is entertaining and just enough to throw the reader off the scent  Or just to question it enough  Is Rachel really crazy  Or is everyone else deceitful  Awesome book  Do yourself a favor and read this one   Loved this book  I couldn t put it down and it had me guessing right up to the very end  I see the parallels with Gone Girl BUT don t let that stop you from endulging in this great read  AMAZING     This seems to be the book everyone is talking about these days and it was even better than the hype made it out to be  IMO  Rachel and Megan  the definition of unreliable narrators  alternate telling their story of how things are never what they appear to be from the outside looking in  A great book full of secrets  lies  twists  turns  lust  and even some humor thrown in  Kept me guessing  I had about 8 theories going at once   I can t recommend this one enough  A                        If you liked Gone Girl  you will love this book This story starts out with a lonely  troubled woman who is riding the train into London every day  We gradually discover why she s doing this  what her situation is  and then the really interesting things start to happen as she observes different people in their homes each day  and what is happening in those homes that she can see into as the train slows and stops on its way into London and on its way back to her home each day This is a story of mistaken assumptions  characters who trust the wrong people  and lie to themselves and others  The plot turns in very interesting directions with the tension and suspense gradually escalating through 2 3 of the book  and very quickly escalating in the final 1 3  At then end of the book  you realize how easy it is to judge people by only the limited facts you know about them  Incredible book  Never have I read a novel where I failed to like a single character  it was so refreshing  When I first began reading the girl on the train I wasn t sure what I was reading to begin with  I had heard so much about this book that I was unsure with what I was given when I began to read  This was soon washed away as the plot started to unravel and all the core characters came into play  It is clear Rachel is a tragic and lost character  who through her obsession for a child has torn her own life apart  The great thing about this character is although she is aware of this she stills holds hope that she can recover what she lost with Tom  The fact you can empathise for her but also get really annoyed at her behaviour and inability to stop drinking is a true show of the authors skill as a writer You want her to move on  rebuild her life and forget the past but the fact she cannot do that shows a very human quality that allows the reader to build a strange relationship with Rachel  it also helps you establish her point of view to cloud your opinion of other characters such as Tom and Anna  The fact that the narrative is split between the key antagonists of the story is also what makes this such a great read  The author has allowed you to see the story through several pairs of eyes to build a more rounded picture of Rachel  her relationship with others but also you get inside the thoughts of the characters themselves which gives the story a more gritty appeal Although I saw a potential twist that I managed to guess before it happened  it still added to the shock and dislike of Tom as well as every other character  This is not something I have com across before  it is brave as people are so used to having a nice ish  narrator that they can relate to and cheer on  but everyone in this has done something awful and are basically just not nice  or more realistically human when put to the test I would recommend this book to anyone as it is something that stands alone in its agenda to be what it is and doesn t set out to make heroes and villains  just to show a very human and tragic story  It is a book I could read a thousand times  This psychological thriller started out slowly  building layers of personalities  neuroses and lies until the climax knocked me out of my seat  For the last three hours  I curled up in my comfy armchair and didn t budge until I was finished    then wished it hadn t ended so soon Kudos to first time author  Paula Hawkins for one of the most compelling reads I ve enjoyed this year  Utterly fantastic  This book was incredible  When I read books like this I think  I REALLY need to expand out of just romance  I just finished and my head is swimming with everything I read  Brilliant narration  complex characters  some of whom I hated and loathed  a tight and compelling plot and wonderful pacing  This was a fantastically suspenseful  psychological thrill ride  From the first page I couldn t put it down  Every time I thought I figured something out my theory was trashed  It wasn t until the last third where I really put my mind into gear  desperate to gleam something  anything before all was revealed  At that point I had my suspicions  mainly because everything else was foiled  Many compare this to Gone Girl  and yes  I see the similarity  But this was much better  Very different too  and needs merit all on its own  This was taught with nail biting adrenaline and build up  I loved it  I felt so sorry for Rachel while at the same time begging her to get it together  It s amazing how little you really know about people  how much they could surprise you with the depth of their depravity  Go into this blind  Don t do your homework  don t ask around  JUST READ THIS  When it ended I felt gutted  in a good way but also in a  wow   that was intense  way  I couldn t believe this was a debut  Anyways  bloody brilliant and highly recommended  I don t know why there are so many negative reviews of this book  I consider myself a pretty discerning reader  admittedly quite inexperienced with thrillers  but I thought this one was awesome  The story pulled me right in  and kept me there  Other reviewers complained about unlikeable characters  but while sure  there s some nastiness  I never felt repulsed by them personally  actions  of course  but not THEM   I liked the book  Five stars  I read it immediately after Gone Girl because there was so much comparison  In my view  this one is MILES ahead of Gone Girl  which I thought was boring  dumb and absolutely full of uninteresting  unlikeable characters  There s barely a comparison to be made    this one is far  far better  Read this  and skip Gone Girl  Loved this and devoured it in three sitting   would have been one of I didn t have a toddler  If you like books with positive  uplifting messages and characters you can root for  pass on this book  you re not going to like it  If  on the other hand you like twisted  complicated characters and stories  like I do  you just might like this book  This is the second book I ve read that s been described as being similar to GONE GIRL  but this one actually comes pretty close  It starts with Rachel Watson  an unemployed alcoholic who is maintaining the illusion of a normal life by continuing to commute daily to London  Every day she looks at the perfect couple in their perfect little house  just a few houses down from where Rachel once shared her own perfect life with Tom Except none of them are perfect  Tom cheated on Rachel with Anna  and is now married to her  The perfect  Jess  cheats on  Jason  her husband  and it turns out not only is she not Jess  she s Meg  but  Jason   Scott  may have murdered her Rachel does a lot of horrible things  partly because of her alcoholism and partly because of her inability to get over Anna destroying Rachel s marriage to Tom  She can t stop calling Tom  and the only thing that seems to let her break away from her sad story is the idea that she might be able to help find Meg s real killer Rachel gets further involved with Tom and Anna  gets involved with Scott  and even gets involved with Meg  the dead girl  s therapist  She vacillates between pathetic and sympathy inducing as she tries  and fails  and tries again to sort her life out I got the audiobook  narrated by three different women  The actress who does Rachel is good  but the actress who does Meg has the most beautiful voice I ve ever heard  especially when she does the Bosnian accent of Kumar Abditch  Chapters alternate between the three women  unfolding the story of what happened with great pacing This novel has everything I could hope for in a psychological thriller  and even though it s only January  I wouldn t be surprised if it was my favorite book all year  I am grateful to the publisher for sending me an advance copy of this book  It is though going to be tricky to review   much of the information is hinted at  inferred and only emerges after a degree of teasing  There s a lot of potential for spoilers If  like me  you commute by train I m sure you will have gazed out of the carriage window into the back gardens of houses beside the line  Often  the track is raised up  and you can see right into the garden  or even the house  Though people are protective of their privacy at the front  nobody seems to realise just how much you can see from the train   the weed choked gardens  of course  the neat gardens  those with trampolines and sandpits    the house with a pair of deck chairs on a flat roof  the bike stored on a fire escape  posters in the bedrooms    what Hawkins has done is to imagine how much you might see if you really looked  if you saw the people as well  which  to be honest  you generally don t at eight in the morning  as they re probably also on their way to work too  That idea of peering into someone else s life is very powerful  But of course lives seen like could be very deceptive Rachel travels into London every day  looking out of the window  observing the gardens  the couple she calls  Jason  and  Jess   weaving happy little daydreams about them  We sense something a little strange about Rachel  but what it is  the book only reveals slowly  Likewise  only gradually do we learn why she is paying such close attention as the train passes that particular row of housesHawkins shows great delicacy and skill as she hints at Rachel s problems  The focus is on the situation she s looking into  not on her  But drawn into that situation she is  there are natural comparisons with Hitchcock  perhaps   Stranger on a train seeing what she takes to be evidence of a crime  is an obvious one  but there are others  too  spoilers   as the book digs deeper into the relationships between the various couples who live beside the railway track I loved the way here that Hawkins makes it oh so plausible for Rachel to be trying to find out about what has happened  She comes to believe she is involved  and that only by filling gaps in her own past  if there are gaps  will she solve the crime  if there was a crime  and only by solving the crime will she fill those gaps  So far  so logical  but Rachel is damaged  blundering  both a threat  so some  and  perhaps  herself in danger  While she is not immediately sympathetic  Rachel is a complex and engaging character who wins over the reader  especially as it becomes clearer what has happened to her  By the end I guarantee you ll be cheering on  though perhaps cringing at what she may do next  It is an absorbing read  perhaps a little slow to get moving   but if you commute regularly you ll be used to sitting waiting  It s all part of the journey  and can be put to good use  I once lived in a house by the railway  in a town an hour from London  We could hear the station announcements from our back garden  We could see the garden from the train  just for a moment  I don t travel that way now but sometimes I take the train from Paddington and I spot that garden  wonder who lives there now  are they happy    perhaps I should take that train more often  and watch more closely  get to know them better    The Girl on the Train is suspenseful  gripping  and provocative in all the right ways  I read this book in six hours  Hawkins  portrayal of the stark truth that the people in our lives we feel the closest to and think we know so well are often no different than passing strangers is both captivating and disturbing  Her gritty and thoughtful representation of depression and addiction is compelling Tom and Rachel are a seemingly happy couple that eventually become plagued with the crushing realities of infertility  As a result  Rachel spirals into alcoholism and Tom finds solace with another woman  Flash forward and Tom is now a happy husband to Anna  the woman he left Rachel for  and a father living out his life in the house him and Rachel bought together but she left when their relationship went sour  As a result of her alcoholism  Rachel loses her job but must keep up what little facade she can to placate her flatmate and convince her to allow Rachel to continue to share her apartment  Rachel takes the train to and from London at work hours everyday to ease any suspicions that she may be unemployed  Unfortunately  this train ride takes her by her old home  the now happy haven of Tom and Anna and everyday she s reminded of her failures and her loss  As a distraction to this sad reality  Rachel becomes fixated on the couple three houses down  A couple she affectionately refers to as Jess and Jason but later learns are Megan and Scott  In Rachel s mind  Jess and Jason appear to be the perfect couple  passionately in love with bright futures as a doctor and fashion designer  In reality  Megan and Scott are facing a growing distance from one another  Scott always at work as an IT consultant and Megan constantly imagining a different life for herself after the failure of her dream art gallery  This reality comes as a slap in the face for Rachel when one morning  from the train  she witnesses Megan kissing another man on their back patio  The next day  Megan is missing and presumed dead  From here  the reader embarks on a suspenseful journey along side Rachel to expose Megan s killer and reveal the dark truth about the people she imagined she knew so well  Hawkins skillfully weaves Rachel s addiction throughout this piece and has the reader rooting for her to find sobriety and get to the bottom of what happened the night Megan disappeared  The cons I found with this book are so few and more due to personal preference and gratification  I don t feel they re even worth noting here  Enjoy this book for what it is  a page turning  suspenseful murder mystery that will have you on the edge of your seat eager for answers   THIS BOOK IS SO DAMN GOOD I MEAN OH MY GOD LOVED IT  Un muy buen thriller   De esos libros que te dejan picada y no puedes parar de leer  No es de esos libros que te dejan algo que aprender solo un libro que no quieres dejar de leer para ver que pasa al final  Si me gusto mucho porque a mi si me gustan los thrillers como estos jajaja  Great thriller  fast paced  in depth character development  Reminds me of Gone Girl  Read it in two days  Very enjoyable  It s been a while since a book sucked me in right from the beginning  and this one really did  I really enjoyed reading it and couldn t wait to pick it up again when I had to put it down   I LOVED this book    Every time a new book is compared to  Gone Girl  I end up being disappointed   The Girl on the Train  lived up to the hype  This book was exciting and suspenseful  All of the twists and turns made it impossible to guess the ending  I would definitely recommend this book   J ai adore l intrigue  le livre est tres prenant   A lire absolument    Hard to put down  wanted to get to the end   Hells yes  This is my kind of book  I suspected everyone but the actual killer  I even suspected maybe Megan ran off for some time  Basically  I thought everyone was potential but the actual killer  I also really related to the main three girls in some way  It was raw and real and suspenseful  and just great all around  I have nothing negative to say about it  Such a great murder mystery  Meine Rezension http   lovelybooksbytine blogspot de     A fantastic thriller  moves at a keen pace  believable characters and what a good thriller should do is keep you guessing right to the end  If you haven t already read it it s well worth it highly recommended  A very good vacation read  In fact  I was always racing back to my beach chair just so I could get that girl off the damn train  Throw in lots of drinking  infidelity  violence and a few train rides and you ve got an action packed suspenseful thriller that I think has a good chance of getting made into a movie  Many are calling it the British version of  Gone Girl  since the story is told in first person from the perspective of the three main women in the story  and since there is some suspense when one of the girls  as seen from the train  goes missing  One of the best books that I ve read in quite some time  The storyline and characters were top notch  Overall  I enjoyed this book more than Gone Girl   especially the ending  I loved this book  I was hooked from start to finish  I love myself some  unreliable narrator  and this book had some to spare I liked the main character Rachel alot  I really felt for her and wanted her to pull through  I loved how they used her blackouts to create tension and obscure the truth  I loved how the view points would switch so that you could relate a little to all the women in the story I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that likes a murder mystery or likes unreliable narrators or to just anyone in general   Ia zhertva reklamy  dazhe ne budu pytat sia govorit   chto shum vokrug eto knigi ne

first on my blog I finished this book yesterday  and afterwards I sat in silence  stumped for a good five minutes  It was a thrilling whirlwind of emotions  confusion and anticipation  I had absolutely no idea what to expect  I heard it referred to as  the next Gone Girl   but that was about it  It also just came out in January this year and it s so talked about that I finally had to throw aside the rest of the books that were next on my list and dive into The Girl on the Train And I m so glad I did  The story is gripping and riveting  The narrative switches from the point of view of three very different but equally disturbed women  and Hawkins does a great job distinguishing between their voices  I was concerned at first that I was going to get lost in who was who  but I never had that problem  It flowed smoothly and effortlessly between narrators and periods of time I came across a few other reviews stating that they guessed exactly what happened  but I honestly had no idea  It was completely unpredictable and kept me guessing the whole way through   Heard this through audio book  Both a good fast paced read listen and very well done with three different readers doing the 3 women who alternate in narration in the first person  The readers have a good range of English accents so you really feel you re in that space  I highly recommend  As for being better than Gone Girl  this is up there with that book  and both are a mystery  but it s a totally opposite type of imperfect protagonist than  Amazing Amy  who is so in control  while  and I m not giving anything away  Rachel is an alcoholic wreck struggling to maintain her sanity while everything is spinning out of control and everyone is turning against her   Enjoyed this novel from the first sentence to the last  Absolutely engaging  I haven t read a book that fast in awhile  But I couldn t put it down  Each chapter that ended kept you guessing  The points of views kept changing but they were easy to follow and things weren t too obvious to figure out  The book started off interesting and ended great  I recommend   It took me 25  of this book to warm up to it but when it clicked I became obsessed  The very best part of the story is how deeply flawed and complex the characters are  I don t want to be friends with any of them but I loved trying to decide who was  bad   Rachel in particular was detestable to me at first and through much of the book  I was so convinced of her guilt that when other plots began to unwind it was like a slap of cold water to the face  Sociopaths aplenty   Although this book is nothing like  Gone Girl   it appeared on the shelves at an appropriate time  just as the film of the said book was inspiring heated dinner table conversations Paula Hawkins novel can only be described as a  ripper of a page turner   Sure  there s a few implausibilities throughout  but name a thriller that doesn t have at least a few  Without giving anything a way  the book features three narrators via virtual diary entries and there s minimal time shifts  It may sound complicated but its actually brilliant in its simplicity There s a disappearance  a murder and a whole lot of time spent travelling on an outer London train   observing the world outside the carriage  I was seriously sucked in by this book  and as Paul Simon once said   Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance   Paula Hawkins debut novel is the ultimate psychological thriller that will keep your pulses racing until the very last page The story is narrated through the eyes and pen of Rachel a lonely somewhat miserable young woman who drinks a lot  let s face it Rachel is an alcoholic  Every morning she commutes by train to London to work  there is also a fantasy going on here as she see the same couple every day from the window of her carriage and creates a fantasy world for this couple  What we then realise here is that the sub plot is that this couple live just a few doors away from Rachel s ex husband Tom and his new wife Anna  The narration from Rachel is something that makes The Girl on the Train something very special and incredibly insightful from a woman whose life really has come off the rails  Through the narration you begin to understand how Rachel lives a life through a glass and if often so drunk she has no memory of what has happened in her life  She has had a drink problem for quite some time and the fact that she lost her job because of it adds to the mystery of her daily train journeys into London Many reviews I have read of Paula Hawkins debut novel said they could not show any empathy with Rachel  yet I totally became involved with her and she stands out to me more so than any of the other lead characters  yet I am not entirely sure why  I put this down to the incredible skill of Hawkins writing and how she has portrayed Rachel  When Megan goes missing Rachel believes she holds vital information as what happened  but alas Rachel s memory is vague to say the least and struggles to recall exact details and the frustration that bubbles to the surface in this taught thriller  Add to this that Rachel continues to harass her ex husband  lies and is viewed with incredible amount of suspicion by those around her  Rachel decides to take it upon herself to get involved in the investigation into the disappearance of Megan and also those very close to the investigation  There is a real twist to the end of the story that will keep you gripped until the very last moments as Rachel finally recalls some detail from one of her previous blackouts  There is so much more to The Girl on the Train that it is at times completely unpredictable a clever and refreshingly brilliant thriller With the huge success of Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl still very much fresh in our minds  2015 has seen some brilliant thrillers based around poisonous relationships but without a shadow of doubt The Girl on the Train is the runaway success of the year and a global smash hit and with a film now due to hit the screens late 2016 staring Emily Blunt in the lead role will surely be just as successful on the screen as the book has been through 2015 If you have been living anywhere other than this planet and you have not yet experienced The Girl on the Train  make this a Christmas book choice to curl up with over the holidays and experience what the rest of the World has in this roller coaster of a modern psychological thriller  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Will be out January 13  2015  READ THIS BOOK     I have read Gone Girl and whilst these two books are compared  I enjoyed Girl on the Train so much more  The book kept me reading into the wee hours and that is rare  I really enjoyed the flawed characters and the anti hero  You struggle to like anyone in this book  but at the same time the flaws and the characteristics you despise  you find yourself thinking  so I am not the only one who thinks that   As a debut novel I thought this book was great and would highly recommend it    better than Gone Girl Hard to put down  I mean it  U want to continue reading and reading and finish it in one sitting  Believe the hype  I loved this book  The narrative structure  with its disrupted timeline  and the characterization  which is accomplished through a pattern of small revelations kept me reading all night long  Rachel is a fascinating  complex character with flaws  fears  and fantasies  Highly recommended for readers who enjoyed thrillers like Gone Girl  Before I Go to Sleep  or Reconstructing Amelia  I enjoyed this book  The audiobook performance was wonderful  YES  Finally a book that I was dying to finish  There are so many comparisons to Gone Girl  but honestly  I didn t see it  Both psychological thrillers  OK  but that was about it  This book completely stands alone on its  own merits  I couldn t wait to see how this one ended and at one point or another  I thought all of the characters were suspects  Great read and so much more satisfying than that other book that everyone else seems to love  Although I had guessed who the killer was from halfway through  my interest didn t diminish till the last page  It was a compulsive read and I finished the book in less than 24 hours  neglecting chores  forgetting everything until I was done  The characters were well drawn  Rachel and Megan  especially  and the revelations of the various backstories well paced and masterfully done  I was given this book by a friend and looked at it very uninterested  I am used to being given books by people about things I am not interested in because  I enjoy reading so much   Long story short I picked it up yesterday and didn t sleep until I read every page  I loved every word  I was so into the book  The thought of it ending actually mad me sad  It has been a really long time since a read a book this gripping  This author is amazing  The characters felt real to me  She didn t try so hard like most authors to make them perfect and over sell them  I questioned each character and formed a love  hate relationship towards each one of them  She made me understand addictive in a way I didn t think is possible  I loathe addicts  strong words I know but we all walk a different part in life   I would only give this book to people that appreciate and take pleasure in the joys of reading   Have you ever played the game of looking at someone  or couples  and making up a story about their life  Rachel Watson  who takes the train daily to her job  does this  however  when she sees something that doesn t fit in with her version of the truth  it sets off a series of events that leaves the reader wondering who are the good guys and the bad guys in this story I really enjoyed this book  but don t want to give away any of the plot points as that is part of the fun  I thought that Hawkins did a brilliant job of showing how everything is not as it seems by using three different narrators with slightly different timelines  Rachel is definitely a flawed character  who you simultaneously feel sorry for and turned off by her behavior  As a debut novel  I think Hawkins hit it out of the park   This book was definitely a page turner  Like some others have mentioned  I did click with who was to blame pretty early on compared to most thrillers  but for me this didn t spoil it    It simply added to that suspense of how it was all going to end  the sense of oncoming dread    The reason I ve given 5 stars is mainly because of the characters  The emotional journeys which you observe them going through are completely believable and it reminds us of the hidden stories that hide behind everyone s  normal  appearances    2016 starts off with a page turning thriller about a woman dealing with her broken marriage and a drinking problem who becomes involved in the disappearance of another woman who lived on the same street that the she used to live on       In the morning  I take the 8 04  and in the evening  I come back on the 5 56  That s my train  It s the one I take  That s the way it is   Sheer brilliance  That s what this book is  I am in awe I had the great honor of meeting the author  Paula Hawkins  a couple of months ago  Naturally  I was excited to read Rachel s story after listening to her discuss this book and the voyage that led to it  Nothing  I mean nothing could have prepared me for what I just read I think Rachel is one of the most interesting and complex characters I have come across in some time  She is just a woman like any other  Sad  downtrodden and defeated by the everyday cruelties of life  but a woman nonetheless  A bit pathetic and definitely lonely  she spends entirely too much time in her head  As we are introduced to Rachel and her current state  it is painfully clear that this poor thing is about to take us on a harrowing journey One of the things that make this book so remarkable is that each character has great depth  They all have a story  As their truths are exposed  you become more and more entrenched in the story  This plot was more realistic than I think we want to acknowledge  Knowing that there are people out there who are this sad and desperate    and common  It makes me look at everyone I see a little differently The settings for most of the book are almost claustrophobic  There is a stifling sense of dreariness throughout the story  I loved the moments when Rachel was on the train  I loved the symbolism  We heard this story from multiple points of view  This added another layer of profundity to the mystery In the end  there is a mystery to be solved  The character development and the world building is so fascinating that one might forget that if the writing wasn t so brilliant  So the mystery    I had no idea who was guilty  I really didn t  I went back and forth several times suspecting each and every one of them  But what it came down to is that you were not going to know until the author was good and ready to tell you  And when the killer was revealed  WOW  Just Wow Even after the mystery is answered this book held me for just a few more pages and offered a couple more twists  I actually smiled at the wickedness of the revelations 6 stars and a gin   tonic for this dazzling book  Here s to many more to come  Purchase link   The Girl on the Train  A Novel   Brilliant  I had so much fun with this book  and I m sure I won t be forgetting it anytime soon  It s easy to see why one critic compared this novel to  Hitchcock   Written in what has become a popular format  the story is told from the points of view of three different women  Megan  Rachel  and Anna  Rachel is the protagonist  the  girl on the train   and the ex wife of Tom  with whom she seems obsessed  We are told of her obsession riding the train so that she can peer into the backyard of her old house and those of her former neighbours  She sees Anna  Tom s pretty new wife  from her vantage point of the train  One day her former neighbour  Megan  goes missing  and the remainder of the novel is Rachel s search for the truth of what happened the night she got off the train  the same night Megan disappeared  Is Rachel herself somehow involved  What did she see  Because of her wine soaked memory blackouts  she has no recollection of that night  only that she was near the station and was seen by a  red haired man  with whom she later meets to obtain an account of her actions  Is he involved in Megan s disappearance  Is Scott  Megan s husband  a killer  Or was her therapist  with whom she was having an affair  responsible for her disappearance  It s a cliche to say it  but this novel really is a  page turner  and our suspense to find Megan s killer is matched by our concern for Rachel herself  our unreliable narrator  whose life  due to excessive drinking  is out of control as we see her shunned by nearly all those who know her  As she tries desperately to puzzle together Megan s disappearance and her own possible involvement in it  we see her climb in and out of an alcoholic stupor that gets in the way of her ability to find meaning and stability as well as her attempt to help solve a mystery she may have done more than just witness  A great read  It s bound to be compared to Gone Girl  I like both  They are different  despite the missing girl and the infidelity themes  The Girl on the Train is more addictive  I finished it in less than a week  which is a record time for me  All the twists  the interwoven tales  the frequent lines that demand you to stop and think  wow  this is great stuff   they make up for a true page turner  I can t remember the last time I felt this challenged  like trying to solve a puzzle or a math question  only with this one you feel very emotionally involved  In that sense  I like it more than Gone Girl But I knew there was something off  I knew when I was about 90  done with the book  I couldn t make it out at first  But just now  2 days later  I can  It s the not so surprising quality of the answer  In Gone Girl  you are left with awe and admiration and fright for Amy  She herself is complex  In The Girl on the Train  the story is complex  while the revelation simply ends the whole thing  The villian is boring  When I think back to the book after finishing it  I think about Rachel and her accurate portrayal of depression and addiction  I don t really care too much for the ending  this was a really good book to read  I couldn t put it down  I love the flow of the story  I felt sympathy for the main character Rachel and was proud of the way she took charge in the end  I didn t care for the two main men in the book but I think we are not suppose to like them  They were both controlling and arrogant  I felt for the other two female characters but I didn t really like Anna  I thought she was cold and self centered but again I think that is how we are suppose to feel for her  I felt sorry for Megan although I think she brought on most of her issues by making bad choices throughout her life  I think she realizes that too  I love the twists and turns through out the story that either make you change your mined on the villain several times or totally confuse you  I usually figure things out with the first 100 pages but not in this book it took me quite a while to put it together but I wasn t sure how it would end  I usually find the ending or the revealing of the bad guy anticlimactic but this time I wasn t disappointed  I found it to be interesting and pretty much on the edge of my chair kind of thing  I really liked this book  A must read   I couldn t put this book down  I was actually reading it while standing in my kitchen trying to cook at the same time  I can honestly say there are very few books where I can t figure out what s going to happen very early on  I couldn t put done the book because I had to know who killed Megan  Literally I forgot I was cooking dinner and almost caught my kitchen on fire     never has a book had me come close to that  LolAnyhow Rachel  The Girl on the Train  is a drunk  We re talking black out can t remember anything total mess  She watches this couple every day while she s on the train  going to her  fake  job  a job she lost but is embarrassed to tell her flatmate   She thinks this couple have the perfect marriage and she fantasies about it and how they must be like  Wow  was she way off on that one  One day she see another man kissing Megan and then one day Megan goes missing  Now she knows she witnesses something that happened the day Megan went missing  of course she was drunk and trying to get to see her cheating ex husband who just happens to live on Megan s street   however  she can t remember what happened  She afraid  bleeding  has a cut on her head and she can t remember anything that happened  She gets involved in the case and desperately wants to figure out what she can t remember  There s murder  black outs  secrets  lies  infidelity  public drunkenness  you name it  it s in here  It s a great book and like I said  I can usually figures things out very quickly but  this book was close to the end when you figure it out  And remember  you can think other peoples lives are perfect and make up fantasies in your head and live them out in your mind but  it s usually way off from what you believed  Happy reading  A page turner  Reminds me a lot of  Gone Girl  by Gillian Flynn   It was a great mystery and it really told the sad tale of an alcoholics life  even the little known fact that when an alcoholic stops drinking  that when they take the next drink  no matter how much later  they become drunk just as quickly if not quicker than before they had quit  Their tolerance to alcohol is less  not greater  Then too the alcoholic blackout is described well  The arrangement of the chapters by character and dates made it a frustrating read  I had to look back often to determine where I was on the time line   Fantastic book with unreliable narrators  Really great story in the vein of Gone Girl  Highly recommended   I am   Completely startled  I have no idea where to begin or even   Wow  Definitely worth

psikhologicheskii triller  Genial Heerlijk boek  jammer dat ik het uit heb  Halverwege had ik het idee dat de schrijver een beetje te lang doorging op de leegte en het drankgebruik van de hoofdpersoon maar op het moment dat ik dat dacht kwam er ook meteen weer een mooie wending in het verhaal  vergeven en vergeten dus  Niet voorspelbaar  leuke invalshoek en het feit dat je bepaalde zaken en dagen vanuit een andere persoon zijn perspectief leest was voor mij weer even een goede reminder dat De Waarheid een relatief begrip is  Rachel  Anna  Megan  Scott  Tom en natuurlijk  Jess  en  Jason    ze zijn je tijd waard  Een detective maar dan net een beetje anders  This book has three narrators Anna  Megan  and most importantly Rachel   who IS the girl on the train  an unemployed alcoholic who rides the commuter train carefully observing and fantasizing about what is going on in a neighborhood she passes twice daily  and whose  blackouts  further the mystery and glimpses of memory serve as clues to solve a devious crime in this new highly acclaimed psychological thriller about trust and betrayal  Very suspenseful and hard to put down   5 stars Wow  that was a page turner  And set in a London suburb  Yes  please  What an amazing read  A page turner  The story about an alcoholic woman who was recently divorced and staying with a friend in a tiny apartment gets tangled with a case of a disappearing person  Her intention to help effects everyone in her life  Paula Hawkins did an amazing job in this psychological thriller telling stories from 3 main characters going back and forth  The simply written language but each chapter leaves you with a question of what is going to happen next  love it    I finished the book in one day  I could not put it down  A book worth all the hype The Girl on the Train is the debut novel of Paula Hawkins    particularly excellent for a debut  Psychological thrillers are one of my favourite genre of novels and I must say i was in awe with this nail biting mystery  They said it was similar to Gone Girl but for me they are entirely different   There s nothing so painful  so corrosive  as suspicion  The multiple points of view of the 3 women made the story bigger and richer  In the beginning I am lost  but really  each time I think I ve figured out who murdered and then suddenly   I m wrong  The twists and turns kept me guessing all over the place  until the very end  It was packed with confusion and doubt  The plot was compelling and brilliant  it has strange characters added to keep it exciting and intense   This book made me go mind f cking crazy and i super loved it  Recommend this to all the readers who love psychological mystery  suspense  thrilling story  P SI am so happy that this book will be going to be a movie soon  Can t wait for it  Took me no time to read at all   BATSHIT CRAZY and i lOVE ITT    kinda reminded me about Gone Girl    Similar feeling i had while reading it         Fantastic book  highly recommended  Fast paced and well written characters  Manipulation at its best  Loved it  Couldn t put it down  Started it this morning and finished this evening  So good  The way this is written just kept me enraptured  Great story  A taut suspense story that is also an elegantly written novel   what a joy   I m used to one or the other  good action yarns are rarely examples of eloquence and insight   The story s tri focal point of view is a fascinating way to tell the story  as we are given three first hand accounts of situations surrounding the central horrific event  Our narrators  the haunted  fragile Megan  whiny  pampered Anna  and bat shit crazy alcoholic Rachel each have unique takes on the matters at hand  It s remarkable that the author is able to make us sympathize with two of the three  Anna is a hopeless case  but we warm to the brittle Megan in spite of her insecurities and most surprisingly  to Rachel  the main narrator  despite her self destructiveness and wrong headed choices at every turn  The woman is a disaster  but like so many train wrecks  we find it hard to turn our eyes away  The book screams for a film adaptation  but I hope they don t do it  The way to appreciate this one is to curl up with the book  Preferably during a thunderstorm  but away from alcohol and sharp objects   Never thought I would love a mystery  Loved the book  Was a quick read and keeps you guessing  Big Little Lies meets Gone Girl  Top 3 of the year for sure At first I thought it was because I m an Anglophile that I couldn t put this book down   but nope   its that good  I thought I had it figured out then 27 twists later  ok  slight exaggeration     THE END  Everything played out vividly in my head  Now I need to go find another book set in England  Rachel s life has become a pathetic lie  Because of her excessive drinking  her marriage has ended and now she s lost her job  To keep her unemployment a secret from her roommate landlady  Rachel continues with her daily train commute  The fact that her train takes her past the former home she shared with her ex husband  and now the home he shares with his new wife  is a painful reminder of what once was  So  instead  Rachel concentrates on the home a few doors down  and watches the goings on of a young couple she s named Jess and Jason  She imagines a detailed and happy life for the couple until the one morning she witnesses something shocking  Rachel is drawn into a police investigation  but her frequent blackouts make her an unreliable witness  Even Rachel doesn t know what to believe  Whoa  this was one crazy book with a bunch of effed up people if I ever read one  The author writes in present tense  which is my least favorite of all tenses  but I understand why she chose it  Paula Hawkins  writing is so fantastic that I was able to forget what the tense was pretty early on anyway  The story is told from three separate POVs  Rachel  Megan  Jess  and Anna  new wife   One woman is more unstable  damaged and insecure than the next  Or maybe the dysfunctionality is equal  just different  Either way  it makes for some very entertaining reading  I read this book quickly  because it was just so darn good  The middle dragged slightly  but I m impatient and I wanted to find out what happened  A few times I thought I knew who the  culprit  was  but the story zipped off in another direction so I was definitely kept on my toes  The Girl On The Train is suspenseful  appealing and thoroughly absorbing  Forget the comparisons to Hitchcock  This book is a unique modern day thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing until the very end   a great mystery I consider this a well crafted murder mystery  The way that Hawkins weaves the story together by going back and forth in time  from different perspectives  revealing just enough of the story to keep you turning the pages is masterful   I loved this one  It was curious to read about a situation from an unreliable narrator  she was drunk most of the time  Rachel is a 30 something year old who has been married and divorced with no children  At the beginning of the novel things were slowly put in to place by her and a couple other characters  and as you keep reading  especially from Rachel s point of view  you begin to wonder if everything is part of their imagination  or has it actually happened There was things going on where I thought I figured out what the big twist was  but on more than one occasion  I was totally wrong  I actually love when this happens  you get more out of a story I think  The characters were generally likable  even Rachel sometimes  at other times you really just want to shake her with the drinking  One thing I can never figure out is why Rachel would want to put herself in the same situation time after time  but in the end it all seems to come together I can sortive see where people are getting the comparison to Gone Girl  however  I think that they both stand on their own tow feet very well  and if you liked one you should like the other  At first I didn t know what to think when Jess went missing  was she really missing  or did she run away with someone else  That part kept the story going at a really good pace I am not sure what else to say without getting in to spoilers  however  if you are looking for a great thriller that will keep you guessing right till the very end  this is a story for you  I give it a 5 5  Wow    This book was a slow start for me  but man what a thrilling ride once it got going  Amazing character development  loved the perspective changes throughout  Kudos to the author   Good ReadI loved the story line  a book I didn t want to put down  I love books with more then one side of the story  great twists and turnsVery enjoyable read  I loved the story and would highly recommend to other readers  I would look forward to other books by this author   As is always the case for me  when I saw all the hype surrounding this book  I knew immediately that I wanted to read it  The description sounded entertaining  and I had high hopes  and The Girl on the Train still managed to exceed my expectations in every way The unreliable narration that lies at the heart of this book is enthralling  and it pulled me in and kept me on my toes for the entire novel  Usually  I get frustrated if I don t know what s going on when I m reading  but Hawkins manages to perfectly balance on the line between reader understanding and curiosity  I never knew the whole story  but I knew enough to keep me interested In the end  what I like most about this book is that the ending provides enough of a  twist  to be entertaining  while still providing enough hints for an astute reader to see what s coming  or at least the direction it will be coming from  It is not often that I say a book ends perfectly  but for me  The Girl on the Train did exactly that I could go on  but in the end the important takeaway from this review is simple  As far as mystery thrillers go  this book is  without a doubt  one of the best I ve found Rating  5 Stars All I can say is   wow  What a ride  I don t want to say too much and spoil the fun  This starts slow  and gets creepier  and the pace picks up  and then it really races at the end  a bit like a train picking up speed   I listened to this from audible com and it was a perfect book to accompany me on my commute  The three female narrators were voiced by 3 actors which added to the tension  You don t know until the end who s a reliable narrator and who isn t  Very clever I m sure this will be adapted for the screen  but I highly recommend you read it first    Auf alle anderen in diesem Abteil wirke ich vollig normal  ich tue  was sie tun  zur Arbeit pendeln  Termine machen  Dinge erledigen  WIE MAN SICH IRREN KANN  Dieses Buch ist wirklich wie Zug fahren  Ein kurzes Ruckeln und schon nimmt es machtig an Fahrt auf  Ich werde nicht lange drumherumreden  Ich liebe dieses Buch   und zwar vom allerersten Moment an  Erwartet habe ich aufgrund des Hypes nicht viel  denn leider wird man ja des Ofteren von  solchen  Buchern enttauscht  Einen Hinweis auf Gillian Flynns Gone Girl werdet ihr hier bei mir nicht finden  denn mir ist schleierhaft wo dieser Vergleich herkommt   Naturlich ist nichts so wie es scheint   anders ware ja auch doof       Die Geschichte wird in drei Teilen erzahlt Rachel  Juli 2013   September 2013 Rachel ist 33 Jahre alt und wohnt in einem Londoner Vorort  in einem kleinen Zimmer bei ihrer ehemaligen Klassenkameradin  Diese lasst sie nur aus Mitleid bei sich wohnen  denn Rachel bekommt seit der Scheidung von ihrem Mann gar nichts mehr auf die Reihe   zudem ist sie Alkoholikerin  Sie fahrt taglich mit dem Zug zur Arbeit nach London und wieder zuruck  Der Zug stoppt immer an der selben Stelle uns so hat Rachel die Gelegenheit  einige der Anwohner zu beobachten  Eine junge Frau hat es ihr besonders angetan   so ein Leben mochte sie haben   hier scheint alles perfekt zu sein Megan  Mai 2012   Juli 2013 Die 29 jahrige Megan fuhlt sich vollig unbeobachtet und fuhrt alles andere als ein perfektes Leben  Sie geht kaum noch aus dem Haus  belugt und betrugt ihren Ehemann und geht zum Psychologen  Eines Tages verschwindet sie einfach  Kurz zuvor wird sie noch von Rachel mit einem fremden Mann in ihrem Garten gesehen  Auch am Tag ihres Verschwindens war ihre Beobachterin ganz in ihrer Nahe  aber da diese mal wieder total neben sich stand und einen ihrer Blackouts hatte  ist sie der Polizei keine grosse Hilfe  Doch noch wahrend der Suche nach Megan  zeigt sich wer sie wirklich war und welche  Leichen  sie im Keller begraben hatte Anna  Juli   August 2013 Anna ist keine Sympathietragerin und ziemlich hinterlistig  Sie ist nun mit Rachels Mann zusammen und lebt mit ihm in Rachels ehemaligen Haus  Wahrend diese ihm keine Kinder schenken konnte  wurde Anna noch wahrend ihrer Affare mit ihm schwanger  Fast taglich wird sie von Rachel belastigt   auf der Strasse  am Telefon     Sie hat richtig Angst vor der alkoholkranken Frau  Ihre Mann ist ihr keine grosse Hilfe  denn er hat Rachel gegenuber ein total schlechtes Gewissen und nimmt sie daher immer in Schutz  Obwohl die Geschichte aus drei Perspektiven erzahlt wird  bleibt Rachel die Hauptakteurin  Ich konnte mich richtig in sie hineinversetzen und mit ihr mitfuhlen  Man war richtig dabei  wahrend ihr Leben immer weiter  entgleiste   Im Mittelpunkt steht die Frage  Ist Rachel die Taterin oder das Opfer  Soll man Mitleid mit ihr haben oder sie hassen  Paula Hawkins hat tolle Nebenfiguren eingeflochten  die eine Bedeutung haben konnten   aber nicht mussen  So legt sie ganz nebenbei noch ein paar irrefuhrende Spuren  die welche sein konnten  oder auch nicht    Da waren Rachels Mitbewohnerin  deren Freund und ein fremder Mann aus dem Zug  Megans Psychiater und ihr Mann  ausserdem noch Annas Mann bzw  Rachels Ex Mann Oft ist es nicht so wie es scheint  Die Autorin lasst einen hinter die Fassade dieser drei unterschiedlichen Frauen blicken und am Ende gibt es eine grosse Uberraschung und man kapiert  Es ist wirklich nichts so wie es scheint  Wahrscheinlich schaut jeder   jeder schaut auf diese Hauser  an denen der Zug voruberfahrt    nur sieht jeder sie anders  Die Hauptstory spielt im Juli   man kann richtig nachempfinden wie unwohl sich Rachel in dem vollgestopften und nicht klimatisierten Zug fuhlt  Dazu noch ihr Ubergewicht und ihre Benommenheit durch ihren standigen Alkoholkonsum   Die Knopfe meiner unangenehm engen Bluse spannen uber dem Busen  und unter meinen Achseln zeichnen sich Flecken ab  die Feuchtigkeit liegt klamm auf meinen Armen  Meine Augen und meine Kehle jucken   Fazit  Eine unglaublich fesselnde Geschichte  Ein unglaublich guter Schreibstil  Ein unglaublich gutes Ende  Suspense     Right up to the end  I ve been ruminating on this story for a few hours  since finishing it I have been trying to find the right words  Here is what I have come up with  first off  the title of this book is a bit misleading  one might believe it s going to be just another cheesy thriller who done it  it s not  Sure  it s thrilling  and you ll be wondering who the heck did it up until the end  but that s such an understatement of this book  Secondly  this book has some complex characters  and though the book is told in alternating chapters between three different women  it manages to be real  and the differences between these women are very clear  This is not an easy writing feat  And finally  the thing that I was most surprised by  and was not expecting  this book is so deeply human  More often than not  books like this tend to have very flat characters  but each and every main player in this book has a full conception  I don t want to say anymore  for fear of spoilers  just know that if you like real people  complex  broken  terrible and beautiful characters  and a little who done it  then read this book  it is unlike anything else I have ever read in the genre  Very good The best book I ve read in a while  Really quite suspenseful  Although I saw the end coming  it was a fantastic read  Besides being a thrilling story  you can absolutely feel the emotion of the main character  Rachel  You can feel her obsessiveness  her pain  her shame  her feeling of unworthiness  You aren t practically in her shoes  you are in her shoes at times  feeling her desperation so acutely  But at the same time you are beside her wanting to champion her on to do what s right   No  don t do that  Yes  do that  No  don t do that   All the way through the gripping story until the end when she draws on her inner strength that seems to elude her throughout most of the book up until the last pages  A creepy psychological thriller   When a woman on a train witnesses a potential crime  she is dragged further into a story that she struggles to escape   Exacerbated by a drinking problem and various emotional issues  the main character is highly flawed  and not even necessarily likeable  but the plot is intriguing and the pace is quick and easy to enjoy   This has been my first  night feeding  book since my little one turned up a week ago  and it was really easy to get carried along by this novel  Very good   Just my cup of tea   Worth a read   I listened to this as an audio book  which I m glad of because of the accents which I adore  If you are someone like me who occasionally chooses to listen to a book rather than listen to music on the way to work  this is one I d recommend as an audio because it makes it simple to keep the characters straight from the beginning  The only problem is that you won t want to turn it off until you get to the end  I was all consumed until the last word of the last page  Found myself listening during my lunch hour  after work and lots of times I shouldn t have been   it was captivating  I see why some reviewers have compared this book to Gone Girl  It has in common three things  a missing person  a narrative that shifts point of view and timeframe and forces the reader to start to put the pieces together  and the insight into the ugly underbelly of the human experience that great authors seem to gravitate toward and understand  And like when I was reading Gone Girl  I found myself obsessively shutting out the world to finish it I latched on to the premise immediately  A lonely  desperate girl watches people from her seat on a daily commuter train and makes up stories in her head  Don t we all watch people and do the same thing to some extent  But then she crosses the line  several in fact  into non normal and unacceptable behavior and we see that she is  as the book says   unstable   and soon we aren t sure where the stories stop and start and reality comes in  But as readers  we want to know what is really going on here  And so the story is able to pull us along first into Rachel s pathetic  sad  booze clouded narrative  This character is tragically messed up and yet oddly thrilling until we wonder if all of us don t have the potential to become a little like Rachel  Then we ask the the same about Ana Scott  or Megan given the right set of circumstances  The thought makes me shiver  So in a way  it s almost a cautionary tale  Don t let yourself slip or you might slide too far and find yourself on the wrong side of a newspaper headline  I ll never ride a train without thinking of this book  Weirdly  I really want to  Ride a train  that is  and watch the people    A great read  Wow  Probably the best thriller I ve read since Gone Girl   Couldn t put it down    It won t stand the test of time as a classic or anything  but it s such a fast read and so absorbing that I had to give it 5 stars  Definitely worth reading   Really enjoyed it  The main character is such a hot mess  but very sympathetic at the same time  The twists and turns at the end will keep you riveted  If you ve ever been dumped  divorced  had a crappy job or gone on an extended bender you will relate to this story  Wow  This book just screams  crazy psychological thriller   It s the the kind of book or movie I am not normally drawn to  but I couldn t put it down  Well  I did have to put it down just to get out of those crazy brains for awhile  I might need to give it a 5star rating on those merits alone  It s like a Steven King novel in the way it gets into your psyche and it takes awhile to shake it loose  I was able to catch on to who the killer was  but all of the characters were so crazy  it kept you in suspense  I see it s picked up to be a major film  It could go either way as a film   super intense and edge of your seat scary thriller  or a complete and utter dud  Let s hope for the former  Except  does it work when you already know how it ends  Wow  I literally could not put this book down  Thanks mum for lending it to me  x Jeden Tag im Zug beobachtet Rachel eine recht biedere Wohngegend und uberlegt  wer wohl die Menschen sind  sie dort leben  Sie selbst wohnte dort ebenfalls einmal  in einem anderen Leben  vor der Scheidung und bevor sie angefangen hat zu trinken  Sie fahrt eigentlich auch gar nicht zur Arbeit  denn ihren Job hat sie schon vor langer Zeit verloren  doch das mag sie gegenuber ihrer Mitbewohnerin nicht zugeben und halt daher den Schein aufrecht  Doch eines Morgens bekommt eine der Fassaden einen Riss  als sie eine der Bewohnerinnen einen anderen Mann kussen sieht  Es kommt jedoch noch schlimmer  genau diese Frau  Megan  wird kurz danach vermisst und dann ermordet aufgefunden  Was ist geschehen  Fur Rachel tut sich ein Abgrund auf  denn sie war am Tatabend vor Ort  um ihren Exmann  der immer noch dort wohnt  zu sehen  Doch sie war so betrunken  dass sie sich an nichts erinnern kann  Kurze Erinnerungen schleichen sich ein  doch sie bekommt sie nicht in ein vertrauenswurdiges Bild  Auch die Polizei will ihr keinen Glauben schenken  obwohl sie diesen anderen Mann auch ganz sicher gesehen hatte  Daher wendet sie sich an den trauernden Ehemann und setzt damit weitere Ereignisse in Gang Der Roman ist geschickt konstruiert  da er auf verschiedenen Zeitebenen spielt und unterschiedliche Perspektiven anbietet  Es sind die Frauen  Rachel als Beobachterin  Megan  das Opfer  und Anna  die neue Frau von Rachels Ex  die die Ereignisse aus ihrer jeweiligen Position schildern  Rachel als Alkoholiker  Megan mit offenkundigen psychischen Problemen und Anna als unsympathische und rucksichtslose   Neue  bieten dabei alle drei keine vertrauenswurdige Berichterstattung an  so dass man hin und her gerissen ist zwischen Glauben und Zweifel  was der Spannung ausgesprochen zutraglich ist  Insbesondere die Figur der Rachel ist glaubwurdig und facettenreich gezeichnet  wie sie als Alkoholikerin kampft fur ihr Leben  gegen die Abhangigkeit  versucht  eine Normalitat und Schein aufrechtzuerhalten und doch immer wieder scheitert  Der Mordfall wird ebenfalls in sich logisch erklart und nachvollziehbar aufgelost  Fazit  Fur mich ist es kein Thriller wie im Klappentext angefuhrt  denn dafur fehlt mir die psychologische Spannung  Aber ein sehr uberzeugender und unterhaltsamer Krimi ist es allemal    A rapariga no comboio  e aquele tipo de livro que queremos levar para todo o lado  E o tipo de livro que quase nos impede de sair de onde estamos porque nao queremos parar de ler  Gosto de livros assim  Que me obrigam a pensar neles quando estou a fazer outras coisas  Este livro e tudo isso e muito mais  Tem uma historia brilhante e surpreendente  Personagens complexas e cheias de contornos arrepiantes e inesperados  Muito bem  Paula Hawkins  For the complete review please go to  Rachelle Reads     The story begins with Rachel  She is a divorcee who spends too much time at the bottom of a bottle  Yet  every day she commutes to London for work  and every day the train slows in the same spot  In this spot  Rachel has vicariously watched this couple live out their life through their windows  Despondent from her own failed marriage she imagines their marriage to be loving and warm  Everything she use to have  but her world quickly begins to unravel when the wife goes missing as she is inevitably drawn into the investigation Megan  on the outside  lives a charmed life with her husband Scott  But on the inside  she is unraveling      The concept tag for this book is Gone Girl meets Rear Window  and I think that s an accurate description  This novel has all the page turning suspense of Gone Girl combined with the voyeuristic delight of Rear Window  This novel resonated with me right away since I used to live in London and took the train often into English suburbia and beyond  I spent hours looking out train windows and wondering who lived in the passing row houses and what their lives were like  That s kind of the premise with which this novel begins  Rachel  the main narrator  travels on the same train at the same time every day  The train stops daily at the same signal light where she is able to glimpse the backside of a Victorian row house and the couple that lives therein  She s constructed a whole life for this unknown couple  given them names  talents  careers  The narrator soon reveals that this house is only four down from where she used to live in her old life that included a husband and a job  Her life is very different now  and as the novel unfolds  Rachel recalls life then and now  Because of her struggles with alcoholism and blackouts  she becomes embroiled in a murder mystery  sure that something she s forgotten is a key clue in solving the mystery Told through the point of view of three narrators  this novel is a fast paced and riveting dark mystery with well developed  likeable  and believable characters  Rachel is a sympathetic character who is terribly flawed but recognizes her shortcomings  This is one of those novels I would term brilliantly crafted  as the writing is as good as the story  and the plot twists are well paced and placed  The Girl on a Train is suspenseful and not predictable  and although I did figure out  whodunnit  before the end of the book  it took nothing away from the story Not only is this the best book I ve read this month  it s the best book I ve read in several months  I dare you to put the book down  I read this book because I m a sucker for a murder mystery and I liked the synopsis  Now  I ve read it s been compared to Gone Girl and to me it couldn t be further from  I read Gone Girl  didn t care for it and it was a huge struggle to finish it while I read The Girl on the Train in a day  This book kept my interested from beginning to end  I was more than eager than come to the end and I really liked the story and the way the author developed it  Some people have criticized the end  but Rachel is a woman struggling with big problems and we can t expect an immediate happily every after  I loved this book and would recommend it to anybody that likes a good thriller  OMG OMG OMG        I m SPEECHLESS    I just finished this book half an hour ago and I am still gob smacked  This book is a gripping thriller that will keep you hooked onto every page   SPOILER FREE  the story is about a woman called Rachel who commutes to London daily on a train  While on the train she fantasies about a couple who lives by the train tracks  she calls them Jess and Jason  she often wonders what life is like for them  as you do right   until one day she sees something  It happens very fast but this shakes her world and the small world she s created  As days and weeks go by  terrible things happen and Rachel finally has meaning in her life  despite the fact she put herself in constant danger  She really is more than just the girl on the train  So much more    If you like thrillers then this is for you  This book also exposes the social taboos like drinking and affairs  it really opened my eyes  I read through this book like the speed of a train  Very hard to put down  Life is cyclical  Events run parallel  History repeats itself  This story was intense  I was amazed I figured it out before I hit the halfway point  because usually I suck at that   With its intriguing premise and Transworld s reputation for publishing some of the best thrillers I ve ever read  The Girl on the Train was one of my most anticipated novels of 2015   and it completely blew me away  Hawkins s debut took the blogosphere by storm and it has every right to be at the top of the charts  It s so brilliantly written  so unpredictable and so full of twists and turns that I read the second half in one sitting and would willingly give it 6 stars if I could One of the  many  reasons why it stood out for me is its narration  Rachel  our main character and narrator  is alcoholic  She s had drinking problems for quite a while and she even lost her job because of it  And why it s interesting  as far as the story is concerned  is because she s unreliable  She often drinks herself to a state where she completely blacks out and has no memory of what she s done when she wakes up the next morning  Add this to a story where she is the only witness and you ll have no idea what to believe All the characters are brilliantly   and very cleverly   written  in a way that makes it impossible for you to know who to trust or who to believe  Not just Rachel  but everyone has their own version of events and they are all acting suspiciously in one way or another  I love books with unreliable narrators and The Girl on the Train was no exception  Read more     I really liked this book  Came in with fairly low expectations   because I m usually just not that into thrillers  But this one had an interesting slant that really pulled me in  It wasn t  perfect   but I still will give it five stars  About the ending     view spoiler   I didn t think it made sense for Rachel and Anna to lie about what happened  Then I thought about it and decided maybe they did this for several reasons  We don t really know what happens with this loose end about whether Scott will he be tried and found guilty for the murder of Megan  Is this because Rachel has decided he s dangerous and deserves to be put behind bars to protect other women from him  Anna s reason for lying might be to protect her daughter from the stigma of going thru life with a murderous father  Yes  he will be known as the father who physically attacked his ex wife and was killed by her in self defense  But he was ostensibly driven to it by Rachel s continued presence in their lives  at least that s the public facade they could adopt  Any way  these questions bugged me some  and I thought the ending would have been better if these had been wrapped up more forthrightly by the author    hide spoiler  That said  I couldn t stop reading this  A real page turner for me   The Girl on the Train blends the suspense of Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl with the angst of Claire Messud s The Woman Upstairs  Rachel Watson  divorced  alcoholic and  mentally unstable   is the girl on the train  She rides it every day to and from a job she no longer has  past a house she no longer lives in  and looks into the windows of other s lives  In particular  she fixates on No  15 Blenheim Road  where Jason and Jess live  so named by Rachel  She s named them and given them fictional lives she covets  until one day she sees  Jess  hugged and kissed by a man not  Jason  and the next day is reported missing  Thus begins The Girl on the Train Told in three voices  Rachel s  Megan s  Jess s  and Anna s  Rachel s ex s new wife   the novel  while gripping  is at its best in these characterizations  particularly Rachel s  I was most affected by her torment  her shame  and yes  her alcohol induced instability  The Girl on the Train makes for excellent reading and would make an equally first rate film  I wouldn t be surprised to see this happen  The Girl on the Train was SUCH a thrill  I am not aware of the proper literary term  but I love the fact each chapter goes from the perspective of multiple characters  Usually  I find it hard to follow but this was so well written  I loved the character development throughout the book because you were building Rachel s character along with her  As she was trying to remember who she is was as a person  the reader follows along with her  I love books which make you constantly try and guess the ending  but this book s ending    UGH  I hate when girls say this  but I can t even LOVED IT   Yanimdan gecen insanlarin ne is yaptigini ya da bir eve bakarken icinde kimler yasadigini cok merak ederdim  Bunun anormal bir sey oldugunu zannediyordum  Yalniz olmadigimi ogrenmis oldum Rachel sayesinde  D Tesekkurler Rachel a gidiyor  Ve katil    O o Asla tahmin edemezdim ben  This book was really amazing  The characters were extremely dynamic and the writing was amazing  The beginning is a bit slow  but it s definitely worth it  If you liked this book  I suggest reading  The Secret History  by Donna Tartt  It has a similar twisted feel that keeps you continually guessing  Honestly  it s a little unsettling how much of myself and others I saw in the characters of this book  All the way through  I saw pieces of myself in Rachel  The most unsettling part is that I started to see my ex boyfriend in Tom towards the end  All in all  a wonderful and fast paced read   Couldn t put it down    Not of major substance but a page turner Loved this book  A great page turner  when I had time to read it  lol  Kinda reminded me of Gone Girl  A book I couldn t put downA life of denial  routine  self destruction and imagination  changes in an instant on a simple regular commuter train journey  Has this single event really altered Rachel s life forever  What are Tom and Anna doing  And where is Jess  I found this book easy to read and hard to put down almost immediately  as opposed to some novels which take a bit of work to follow and get into the story lines at first  That being said  the book is not simple and is therefore very well written  following the timeline diaries of some of the characters in order to weave a complex tale  in an unguessable plot until the last few pages You cant help feeling that this book has been written by an author who has experienced or understands the twists and human emotions that have been captured brilliantly  and whom highlights varying human conditions as each frailty arises perfectly  In short a really good read for someone who wants a  look over your shoulder  kind of book   enjoy A pageturnerish mystery that begins when Rachel Sanders observes a couple in their apartment while she passes in the train  every day  She becomes interested in watching for them  creates a story about them  and we are off an running with a surprising  twisty story that sometimes get messy and out of control but is never dull  If I could rate this higher than 5 stars  I would  This is THE BEST book I have ever read   I read this book in one sitting because it was just too intriguing to put down  I immediately identified with Rachel  our first narrator  whose life has basically hit rock bottom  After trying to conceive a child only to be told she was barren  she began drinking heavily to ease her pain  Her marriage begins falling apart as a result  and her husband ends up leaving her for another woman  Alone  alcoholic  and depressed  Rachel moves into the spare bedroom of an old friend and survives of off cheap liquor and spending her day on long train rides to London and back  Much of her storyline is spent idealizing her past and acting out in drunken rages to try and get her life back  As a divorcee  I understood the hopelessness she faces at times and completely empathized with some of her struggles  She does  however  become frustrating as she refuses to move on and start her life over  she is happier living in a fantasy world where she makes up people and relationships in her mind  Enter Megan  Megan is a woman that Rachel sees every day from the train  and Rachel has constructed a fantasy world about Megan and the life she leads  Megan lives a few doors down from Rachel s ex husband and his new wife  so she often fixates upon Megan to pass the time as the train passes by the station  Rachel builds Megan up as a paragon of womanhood  representing everything she herself lost  until one day  she sees Megan doing something shocking  This causes Rachel to relive the emotions of her own sordid past and she grows angry at the fictional person Megan has come to represent in her twisted imaginary world  She soon learns Megan s real identity as Megan turns up missing the following day  Rachel has no memory of the evening of Megan s disappearance as she was on an alcohol fueled rampage on Megan s street harassing her ex husband and his new wife Anna  She wonders   where is Megan  and is she responsible This event throws Rachel into a tailspin  Her life and hold on reality slips even further  As she struggles to remember what happened  she involves herself in Megan s life and disappearance to a degree that is dangerous to her physically and legally  As she slips further from herself  Rachel comes closer to the truth  We briefly see Anna  the new wife s  perspective on the events throughout the novel  but the reader is left wondering constantly  who can I trust  We have a drunk  a liar  and a home wrecker  Whose intentions can we truly see and who has hidden motives This thrill ride of a novel will keep you turning the pages until the end when the reader  Rachel  and Anna come face to face with the shocking truth  Brilliant read   the pace of the book never slackens as the stories unfold  There is an honesty about flawed characters  the three women in this book are all struggling one way or another and the theme running through is how women punish themselves  I read a lot of reviews about the book before I bought it   a lot of them stated that none of the characters were likeable  but I really felt for Rachel   yes she is an alcoholic  but as we travel through her story I had a lot of sympathy for her This is a story of hope  I was only a third of the way in and I realised just how blessed my life was   Rachel s loneliness seeped off the pages  She was at her lowest ebb and while she might have done dreadful things  I believe she was trying hard to please everyone around her  Imagine going to London by train every day and hanging about in Libraries because you don t want your flatmate to know you have lost your job  She never burdened Cathy  her flatmate  with any of the pain she was suffering  why she was drinking  she carried her burdens alone  Its pity that prevented her from opening up  when you are at your lowest ebb  pity is unbearable  Despite being labelled crazy  dismissed and scorned  she is very brave  she tries to help people  Scott  and Anna  even though they treat her with such contempt  Rachel does pull her life together the ending was very satisfying and hopeful  Paula Hawkins writing is excellent  this story drew me in  the characters portrayed so well   and the pace relentless  It takes talent and skill to pull that off  I can t wait to read more  for a first book this is an astounding achievement   A slick  on the edge of your seat style thriller  with a highly original plot  I loved this book  so much so that I don t want to give away any of the plot for fear of ruining the reading experience for others  What I will say is that having made the commute to London Paula Hawkins so vividly described  I felt like I was right there on the train with the main character  Rachel  The Girl on the Train is an excellent piece of writing for a debut author  I cannot wait to see what Paula Hawkins comes up with next  OH MY GOD one unreliable narrator makes it hard alone  but Three  Rachel  The most frequent narrator  Alcoholic  troubled  divorced  jobless Anna  Pretentious  Self obsessed  jealous  liar Megan  LIAR  cheat  a Had been drug addict AND NO ONE AMONG THE THREE CAN BE TRUSTED There aren t too many characters  which makes it even more confined  tight  gripping  enthralling  The prose is as simple as it is effective  with red herrings all over the place  you think it could be that one for a moment  the next moment you re convinced that it can t be them  Although you know you can t trust the narrators  you have But no choice  And you fall right into Hawkins  trap  guessing and guessing till the very end  Every single character is flawed  and their flaws well portrayed  Hawkins  character insight is Brilliant  And having the story narrated by three women was a masterstroke Anyone who loves a mind boggling  deep and dark  disturbing and brilliantly crafted psychological thriller  go grab THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN  NOW  Something happened that day  Something that triggered the events that connects three women  an alcoholic  a mistress and a cheater  Rachel  Anna and Megan  three different women and each one of them has a different role to play Have you ever wondered how other people live their life  Have you created a story about those strangers you saw  Named them  Made a perfect story about them thinking it was you  Rachel  the girl on the train  did  Whenever the train stopped at the station  she will observe the couple  which she named Jess and Jason  through the train window until one day something happened  Something that destroyed her perfectly crafted story about Jess and Jason  Something that she cannot remember  Something that pulled her into their lives  Something that tied Rachel  Anna and Megan together When I saw The Girl On The Train on my favorite book store  I searched it on goodreads and found that it is somewhat similar to Gone Girl  Somewhat similar because it s much more fast paced and more creepier  Which I cannot fully agree because I haven t read Gone Girl yet  But it is fast paced and creepy The book is full of mystery  secrets and lies  Lies that leads to another lie that they didn t notice that they re living a life full of lies  Paula Hawkins wrote a book that is utterly unpredictable  I came up with at least five theories on how the book will end  and none of them was correct  It s just frustratingly beautiful I recommend this book to those people who loves mystery and thriller NOTE  Free yourself before reading this because once you start you cannot stop until it s finished  OMG    This book was soooo good    So many twists in the plot it keeps you guessing until almost the end  Psychological thriller about a woman who witnesses something she feels the police should know except when the delve into her past they deem her an unreliable witness  Book proves the point that our memories and perceptions of what we think  are not always remotely close to what actually was or is  I think the only part I was remotely disappointed in was the ending  Didn t seem totally believable to me in the fact that we live in a more violent society today than in years past  But then again it is a psychological thriller so I guess he has to toy with her for awhile anyway  It would be unfathomable to my slightly younger self that I would find so much to explore in the way of gender politics from mystery thriller bestsellers  but authors like Gillian Flynn and Paula Hawkins have changed my mind  This is a book for every heartbroken woman who needs reminding that the lost relationship was never that good to begin with  Paula Hawkins spends ample time will all three of her narrators  all experiencing grief  all looking for power  and all struggling with being and being unable to be a mother  the only role for which women are valued  It isn t typical family drama  though it might sound that way  The Girl on the Train is a dark  puzzling story without sentimentality  Thoroughly enjoyed this mystery  It kept me guessing until the very end  The author alternated chapters based on the view points of the three main characters  It was cool to see each one s individual perspectives which was very different from the persona they presented to others  This book is in the vein of Gone Girl but not quite as good  Still I would recommend it  This is one of those books that s hard to put down  My only criticism was sometimes I just wanted to shake the main character and slap her across the face to stop making bad choices  One of my new favorite books  I couldn t put this book down  I was reading it sitting in traffic  when I got out of the shower  I was late to work  up in the middle of the night  and ignoring real life  The alcoholic flashbacks were appropriately chilling and terrifying  the ultimate unreliable narrator  To be honest  I guessed the ending at a little over halfway  I didn t care at all  the unraveling was psychologically riveting  The whole concept is fascinating  A girl watches a couple from the window of a train every day and gives them an invented identity  Neighbor watching is a common phenomenon and Hawkins turns it sinister in an ingenious way  This book lives up to the hype  I very much enjoyed this book  It is told from three characters points of view with Rachel being the main character  as she is the girl on the train  I liked the short chapters which always keeps me reading and I also was eager to get back to the other women s stories At first  I found the voices of the three women to be similar but in time I realized they in many ways had similar qualities  The ending is a bit over the top  but most thrillers end with a bang I ve seen comparisons to  Gone Girl  and a modern day Hitchcock and I found it to be all that  Thrilling ride  Held me in suspense  with great characterizations  One of those books that has you saying to the characters  oh  don t go there  don t do that   Right up to the end  Excellent twist at the end  and it didn t seem like a cheat  I highly recommend it  and the audio book version is excellent  Three actresses reading three characters  and do such a great job  How did this collection of dysfunctional characters find each other  I enjoyed the book from beginning to end  Unlike other reviewers I didn t figure out the killer until almost the end so I was reading late into the night to get the answer  very good book love how it was told from different perspectives couldn t put it down I started on page 18 in the morning    and I was done by the evening  I couldn t put it down  I loved the pace  I loved the unlikable characters  I was reminded at every stage of Patricia Highsmith s dark brooding and psychological twists  Suspenseful and creative  Great story development and characters  The Girl on the Train is Paula Hawkins  debut novel  and it s a cracker of a read  She s delivered one of those stories that you don t want to stop reading until you reach the end because it becomes so tense and the chain of events and revelations keep you hooked  the fast paced storytelling reins you in and doesn t let go  This is a gripping psychological crime thriller  a genuine page turner of a novel  The opening premise is a great idea  and so easy to identify with   how  whilst travelling by train  we might look out of the window and observe the lives of others playing out in gardens backing on to the tracks  and imagine what those lives might be like  Three young women narrate the story in turn  and each one of them had me questioning what was true  what was really happening  what could I believe  Rachel in particular I thought was very compelling the way her character was drawn and fleshed out  A couple of quibbles aside  which I can t really mention because they would be spoilers  I found this to be an addictive  twisty read and a cleverly told debut novel which I think will be massively popular with readers  4 5 stars rounded up to 5  Wow  What an incredible story  I was constantly interested  always trying to figure it out  wondering what would happen next  And I love how she wrote the story by date from three different perspectives  I loved knowing exactly what was going on in each character s head  Paula is a talented writer  with a creative mind  What a crazy  twisted  incredible story  SPOILER ALERT My only complaint is all the evil  All the lies  the addicts  the affairs  the abuse  Even our heroine  Rachel  was a drunken liar  This book made we wonder if the author has never had a real friend or an honest relationship   Which is clearly a super harsh and unrealistic judgment  P  But I would have felt better if she d have included more good  honest characters in this evil little world of hers  I guess that s why I do better reading Teen Fiction    I m not sure which book those who so vehemently disliked it were reading  but I found The Girl on the Train definitely lived up to its more positive press  The Girl on the Train was a taut  dark  psychological thriller that kept me glued to its pages until the end  Yes  the characters were not especially likeable and were  for the most part  extremely flawed examples of humanity  and that  for me  was one of the elements that kept this reader wanting to know how the mystery would be resolved  The author carefully wove the various threads of the story together so that the reader could gradually get to know the characters as fully dimensional people who were the engines of their fates  not as flat  stock character portrayals  This process of character development  while gradual  was instrumental in building the mystery s tension  As for the book s naysayers  I think perhaps their evaluation of this story was based on a lack of reading stamina wherein they wanted a quick  easy narrative fix that was not too mentally taxing and easily digested for instant gratification  My advice to them is to leave psychological thrillers alone and stick to Harlequin Romances    This book was intense and fabulous and heartbreaking  A hell of a ride  I woke up early to take a shower this morning and ended up unshowered and late for work because I needed to finish this book  Great read   loved this book So good  I was glued to this book and read it in 4 hours  It was that gripping  If you are a fan of Gone Girl or Hitchcockian thrillers  this is a must read The Girl on the Train is written from a few different perspectives  but focuses mostly on Rachel  To put it delicately  Rachel is having a tough time sorting out her life  Every day  Rachel s commuter train stops at a signal  which gives Rachel the perfect view of a seemingly happy suburban couple  who she names  Jess and Jason   Rachel dreams up a magical life for this unsuspecting couple  imagining them as a perfect couple  with a perfect life  However  one day Rachel sees something that shatters the illusion and cannot keep it to herself  Soon  Rachel becomes entwined in the life of this couple in dangerous and thrilling ways If I haven t made it clear above  you should definitely read this book  It is enthralling  engaging  and intriguing  It s not a happy  fluffy novel  so don t read it expecting any of that  But it is well written and full of mystery If you read it  let me know what you think in the comments below  Very odd characters  quick page turner with lots of suspense created continually making you guess what was about to happen and who did it     Not my usual kind of book but it was interesting    Perdi o controlo sobre tudo  ate sobre os lugares dentro da minha cabeca     p  18 Enervante  inesperado e intrigante   A Rapariga no Comboio e um daqueles thrillers em que a leitura se transforma facilmente em compulsao Mais do que a historia  o requinte raposino com que esta e narrada obriga nos a dedicar lhe toda a nossa atencao  completamente absorvidos  morbidamente fascinados com as problematicas vidas destes personagens Narrado a tres vozes  transferimos as nossas suspeitas a cada nova informacao  o que acaba por tornar a leitura muito estimulante e dinamica  Rachel  personagem de particular concecao  e o oposto da comum heroina  de indole autodestrutiva  Rachel comprometeu a sua vida a todos os niveis gracas  em grande parte  ao consumo excessivo de alcool  Queremos acreditar nela  apesar de sabermos que recorre a mentira sempre que lhe e conveniente e tememos  tal como ela  pela revelacao dos episodios em que o alcool lhe roubou a memoria  Nada e o que parece    nem ninguem    Com o enredo inteligente e complexo de um livro que nao pretende ser apenas mais um nas nossas prateleiras  A Rapariga no Comboio e ja um dos meus preferidos deste ano  This has been hugely compared to  Gone Girl  the huge hit from last year   Or was it 2013  Time flies    There are a number of similarities  both are narrated in first person and told from different points of view from the main characters  both tell the story of broken relationships and both are absolutely gripping The Girl on the Train however keeps everything entirely secret until the last chapters  leaving readers guessing what is happening right until the very end I found this really well written  Rachel  the main character  is someone that you both love and hate Really great story and an absolute page turner  There were a few loose ends i would like to have seen tied up i e  what happens with Scott  with the therapist  but on the whole great story  I Make up Myself  in PassingMotive disintegrates beneath flaws in everyone s story about each other  I may have read hundreds of books between this one and the last I rated here  though that has to be some exaggeration too  I get put off by social media  as if thought were a train  and as if I wanted anyone to think I had somewhere to go  I m as lost as the rest of us  and a lot less entertaining This book popped up because it was on someone else s list to whom I ve been algorithmically connected in ways someone more clever than me controls  Some team of people  It has always been the equivalent of being outdoors  naked  to say something  which must be why I flip binary between silent and weird  How should one dress in the social network scene But we do make up stories about ourselves and about others  and they exist at the same distance that we each exist from ourselves  which is passing distance through a train window if it pauses enough to obey a broken signal  That s the conceit of this book  and it seems right on It s almost a detective story  teasing a truth that never comes  sort of  but satisfying enough to call it an end and get some sleep  finally  without having to ponder any more than you already have while reading  Nice There are multiple first persons  and you might be one or several of them  except that they are women and I am but a man who mostly deserves the motives imputed  guilty or no  Clueless And one whose story is passing into someone else s  because the pieces of it lose coherence beneath memory rotted by age and drink and loss of motive  because someone else imposed theirs on me  is it  Too much self is itself a crime All that is left are fragments  Tying them together is hard work for a reader  and the author s job is to make it worth the while Nice work  Thank you  Great storytelling  lots of twistsPaula Hawkins s is a great storyteller  The reader becomes the main character  Rachel    the girl on the train  Haven t we all looked out a window  made up a story about what we ve seen  Fallen in love with an illusion  But Rachel with all her flaws  is the one with strength to finally face the truth about herself and others  Conflicts between a wife and the ex wife  a guilty therapist  lovers and haters    all could be such typical storylines  but the author takes us on an interesting and unpredictable ride  Gets better as you go along  Recommended read  Me ha encantado  Paula Hawkins debut novel is one to remember I must admit  I wasn t convinced at the start  I didn t seem to be able to understand the characters but I soon got into the storyline  I loved the character of Rachel and it was great to see how your opinions constantly changed throughout I was gripped continuously at the end and I can now not wait until the film is released  A great job has been done by Hawkins  When I first started reading this book  my first thought was   How is this going to get suspenseful  It s just some drunk woman riding a train   Well  I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly this book picked up the pace  and I had trouble putting the book down  This book had me scratching my head  and thinking   Rachel  You are being stupid   sometimes at the same time  My only complaint is I wished the author waited a little longer to expose who did it  At about page 250  give or take  I figured it out  and then I was waiting for the characters to figure it out  This is a must read   While I am a sucker for quite a few literary tools  there is none that I succumb to as much as the unreliable narrator  I think it is the closest thing to having a relationship with a book   god  I m single  Seriously  with most fiction you accept that you are reading the story as is  No skewing the truth  no hiding  not that much anyway  and no funny business  While some people are that honest  I don t know a single person in the dating world that would assume that about another human being  In that way  a relationship is like reading a book with an unreliable narrator  you can sit for hours and invest yourself in a story and a narrative and completely forget that they have the power to SCREW WITH YOUR MIND  But  for the sake of experiencing the story  you keep reading anyway  You ignore the warning signs  maybe try to figure it out  but know that nothing can come from hypothesizing  you just have to wait for the truth to come then deal with what comes The only thing better than having one unreliable narrator Having multiple No  that is not a metaphor for polygamy   This is one of those books that builds steadily toward a slam bam climax  I can t say I rooted for the main point of view character  Rachel  but she seemed real and I did feel for her  even though she was her own worst enemy at times  It has some tricky twists and turns  and though I did guess the ending  I still felt compelled to keep turning the pages  I can see why this novel is getting so much buzz  It s hard to put down  I gave it five stars for that alone  I was never bored   Ale jo  za to  ze jsem cetla  kudy jsem chodila  tak davam plny pocet hvezd  Hlavni hrdinky mi lezly na nervy vsechny a ti dva kohouti taky  Nakonec si moje sympatie asi nejvic ziskala ona samotna  divka ve vlaku  Rachel  Jestlize je 50 odstinu  porno pro mamky   tak Divka ve vlaku je  detektivka  thriller pro mamky   Hlavnim tematem tam je tehotenstvi a rodina  at uz chtena  nechtena  vytouzena ci odmitnuta  Protoze nepatrim k pravidelnym ctenarum kriminalnich romanu  tapala jsem do poslednich stran  kdo je vlastne vrah  A zaver se bude jiste velmi vyjimat ve filmovem zpracovani  AWESOME  I was hooked from page one  I could not put this book down  It kept me guessing until the very end  and the complex characters made for a thrilling story  This was a thoroughly entertaining summer read   Wow  Just wow  I am blown away by this book  because in the beginning I didn t know what all the fuss was about  At first we are introduced to a women riding the train to work and depressed with her own life  Just because of her observations from the train window  she becomes embroiled in captivating missing persons case for a woman she doesn t even know  There are so many twists  turns  lies  and hazy memories that this story keeps you turning the page   view spoiler   The last person I expected to be Megan s murderer was Tom  I didn t like him and thought he was a terrible husband  but didn t have any idea he would have been seeing Megan as well as murdering her  I was really stuck on Scott and I can see why the police and even Rachel thought he was the killer  I just wish poor Rachel had someone in her life to really help her get everything together  Tom used her depressing and drinking against her to make her feel worse and worse  And Anna really only cared about herself  and was blind to her husband s lies Even Rachel s mother was distant and Cathy didn t know Rachel well enough I guess  I also am shocked by how much Tom lied about   hide spoiler   This book really shows how complicated marriages can be and all the lies that can fill them  I listened to this book on my commute and whenever I got to my destination I was sad that I had to stop listening  All three voice performances were great and definitely distinct so I could easily tell who was speaking at all times  The red herrings in this book were excellent and even though I grew suspicious early on  I wasn t sure until almost the end of this great mystery  Full of exciting flashbacks from Meagan and Rachael trying to fill in the blanks during her blackouts  this book was worth every second  Loved it  So so so good  Un put down able  Another favorite  I could not put this book down  I suspected EVERY character in the book and was still surprised by the ending  Paula Hawkins knows how to write  Is this the new book that s now cool to hate  Haha  I actually really loved it  and was hooked from the first page  It s been a long  long time since I finished a book in one day  People kept comparing it to Gone Girl but I didn t find it to be that way at all    I m going to tell her that the line he used with her don t expect me to be sane  he used it with me  too  when we were first together  he wrote it in a letter to me  declaring his undying passion  It s not even his line  he stole it from Henry Miller  Everything she has is secondhand   Pg  34  the Girl on the Train by Paula HawkinsHave you ever seen a stranger in your travels every day and wondered what their life was like  That curiosity is taken to a whole new level in The Girl on the Train  Rachel is still reeling from a bad breakup and grieving its loss by drinking more and more  A bright spot in her lonely life is seeing the same couple at a house that her train always stops near  In fact  that couple eventually becomes so real to her that she feels she knows them and gradually an obsession grows  One day  her burgeoning voyeurism on her daily train ride leads to witnessing something that is far out of the norm for this very happy couple she s named Jess and Jason  What does she do  She knows  Jess  and  Jason  and is now very invested in their lives  Maybe she can help them  Maybe it is her DUTY to help them  Yes  she decides  it s time to become more involved  Now  before it s too late I was so absorbed by this hypnotic book that really  I became the voyeur  too  I was reminded of Patricia Highsmith  and yes   wait for it  Gone Girl  I was guessing till the very end  I felt a loss when this book was finished  I need more Paula Hawkins   I could not put this book down  It was just one thing after another  Great characters and story  THE ENDING   All the characters were well developed even though they were a crazy mess  Definitely a page turner and would recommend this book for people who like a chic lit mystery  Sorry for labeling it  chic lit mystery  but the characters and their problems would annoy the hell out of some people  A good book though   Oh goodness  what a good read  This book kept me up well past midnight because I had to find out what happened  I really love when the authors keep you guessing and Paula Hawkins did not disappoint   and it s her first book  I will definitely read whatever else she writes   The Girl on the Train  by Paula Hawkins  is a thriller about power within relationships  emotional abuse and the unreliability of memory  It explores an individual s selective vision  the lies we tell ourselves in order to maintain the fantasies in which we wish to live  It lays bare how memory is a construct as much as a recollection  that interpretation can rely on corroboration  It questions the fanciful  selfish reasons for trust  how we judge and are judged Rachel is struggling with her life  She has lost her husband  her job and her self respect  Each day she travels to London by train  passing the house where she once lived  She watches a young couple who now live nearby  imagining the happy lives they lead until she almost believes it is real  She feels that she has got to know them  so much so that when one of them disappears she cannot stop herself from becoming involved Rachel wishes to help  to uncover the truth  but what of her story can be believed  She is an alcoholic  dogged by memory blackouts and vivid dreams  She is an unreliable witness who cannot even be sure herself what she remembers The plot is compelling  multi layered and tightly written  Each of the characters adds intrigue leaving the reader guessing but never quite sure of where the tale will go next  As each character is forced to shed the blinkers they have chosen to wear and to face what has been happening around them the painful truths cause their lives to implode The imagery of the train is a constant throughout the book and works well  A journey  strangers  the unrelenting presence like the elephant in the room  I was impressed by the author s careful unveiling  the pivotal secret and the chilling denouement This is an engrossing tale that will not disappoint  It may just cause a few more commuters to look out of train windows and imagine the lives that are being lived as they pass by  This psychological thriller will have you turning pages quickly  The story is told through three women  Rachel  Anna  and Megan  whose lives are intertwined in ways they don t even know  The secrets  lies  and betrayals lead to misfortune for all the characters  Enjoy  Really good suspense  the ending was my favorite  Through the whole book the author Hawkins kept me thinking Rachel was just drunk and she was the one who killed Megan without knowing it  I was wrong   This book was defiantly a dark read  I had no idea who did it until the end  I was like ohhhhh snap  It was really good  I m looking forward to seeing the movie next year  A very impressive debut novel  Disclaimer  I kept myself pretty much in the dark about this book before reading it  GONE GIRL comparisons notwithstanding  I didn t even know it was set in England  I thought the train in question ran from NY to Connecticut  So  the early pages required a bit of adjustment on my part  but before I knew it  I was at page 50  page 100  halfway  then 100 pages left  The narrators weren t immediately likable  but I think they were real with the kind of honesty that usually gets edited  I understand why people say they didn t connect with the narrator s   but I did find the story to be compulsively readable  which is why I call it a five star read  And while I didn t so much enjoy the character of Rachel  I found that her growth propelled the story forward toward a satisfying ending   OMG     This ranks up there with GONE GIRL  Amazing  so good Couldn t put it down  Rachel    the primary narrator    is an often unlikeable woman  delusional and depressed  drowning in booze and the dregs of alcoholism since the breakdown of her marriage to Tom  The narration also shifts to Tom s self absorbed new wife  Anna  and to Megan  a hedonistic and impulsive woman who is suffocating in her role as suburban wife  When Megan goes missing  both Rachel and Anna find themselves involved  What do they know  Where is Megan  That Rachel is drunk nearly all the time and a compulsive liar on top of that makes her a highly unreliable narrator  both to the reader and to her own self  She struggles to reclaim memories from the night Megan went missing    a night when Rachel was in that neighborhood and black out drunk  This story is full of surprises  swings and turns  and is gripping to the very end  Anyone who liked Gone Girl will appreciate the creativity in the craft and the many layers of both light and dark in the characters   Trendeki Kiz dun bitti  Kesinlikle aldigi her ovguyu hak eden bir kitapti Konusunu cogu kisi biliyordur ama ben yine de ufaktan bahsetmek istiyorum Rachel isini ve evliligini

gazetelerde okudugu bir haber 23 numarali ciftin hayatini trenden izlemeyi birakip bizzat dahil olmasina yol acar  Kitap polisiye turunun en heyecanli  katil kim acaba diye merakla dusunduren kitabi degil  Ama yazar karakterleri oyle derinlemesine yazmis ki  Okurken kendinizi Rachel in duygularindan alikoyamiyorsunuz  Ben okurken onunla birlikte dibe cokup onunla birlikte caresizligin tadina baktim  Diger karakterlerin hepsinden nefret ettim  Acimasizliklarindan  umursamamazliklarindan  piskinliklerinden nefret ettim  Gercek hayatin tum acimasizligini onumuze serdigi icin yazardan da nefret ettim ama ayni zamanda bu durust yonunu sevdim de  Bilmiyorum kafam hala karisik jhkjjg Kitabin sonunda bosta kalan ufak tefek seyler var ama puan kirmaya degmeyecek seyler oldugundan 5 5 veriyorum kitaba  I ve heard a lot of complaints around this book  mainly centered around the fact that none of the women in it are particularly likable  especially Rachel  the main narrator   That s true  and thus a valid complaint  but since when is it important that a story be full of good and wonderful people to be a story worth reading At any rate  if you are thinking of reading this book  do it  And  if it s not already too late for you  try and go in as cold as possible  knowing as little as you can  It s the best way to go in Also important  try and start it when you have a lot of free time  It s absolutely impossible to stop reading once you start   Fun fact  the letter from the publisher at the beginning of my e galley said that one of the Penguin staffers was actually reading this under the desk at a meeting because she was close to the end and couldn t stop  I completely sympathize   I was five minutes late to work because I was close to the end and couldn t stop  I enjoyed this book a great deal and Paula Hawkins is a new must buy author for me  Highly recommended  This book is quickly becoming the  must read  novel of 2015 and I would agree  Paula Hawkins has written an engrossing psychological thriller that held me spellbound  so much so that I read in two days because I could simply not put it down  Gripping  fast paced  and told with such heart wrenching honesty  I was totally wrapped up in Rachel  Megan  and Anna  the three women whose lives are changed forever because of what can be seen from a train  I m amazed this is a debut novel and will certainly be looking forward to more from this author  There is a temptation to compare to  Gone Girl  and I think those who like one will like the other because both are intense  cleverly plotted and with not so nice  heroines  Highly recommend  I read this book in 2 days it was so good  It reminded me of  Gone Girl  with the story jumping from different points of view  I can normally predict what s going to happen in a book but I didn t with this one  All the clues were leading me towards Rachel killing Megan so I was surprised by the ending and I m glad  that doesn t happen often  I loved the irony of Rachel killing Tom with the corkscrew too    nice touch  Fantastic book  I found it a little slow to begin with and I had a hard time following the jumping from one thread to another  and then I realized that the dates and times were stated at the top of each section  as well as who s story we were following   oops  Paying attention to those details made the whole story a lot easier to follow hehehhe The Girl on the Train is going through the motions  pretending to live a real life  with a reason to be on a train  a real destination to arrive at  a schedule to keep  In reality  Rachel s life has fallen apart and she spends her days trying to drink her time away and avoid as many reminders of her old life as possible  But her daily train journey takes her past her old house  and as she stares out the window  day after day  she thinks about the people who live next to her old home  She watches these strangers in tiny flashes of their daily lives  she gives them names and makes up stories about them  She grows to think of them as her friends Then one day she sees something which sours her whole fantasy  and suddenly she feels she needs to intervene in the lives of these strangers  to sort them out  but instead she finds herself involved in a murder investigation  one which brings her all too fully back into her old life Brilliant twists and turns that will keep the reader guessing all the way to the last page  PerfectRead in 3 days  It grabs you in and wont let you go until you really know what and why Very intense story  I was sucked in from page 1  I highly recommend it    Read this in a day  Couldn t stop  I love a great psychological mystery  and this was one  Also  I didn t see the ending coming a mile away  which I always appreciate  Some language situations but not nearly as graphic as Gone Girl  Gripping read  satisfactory ending  Hope Hawkins writes another one along these lines  On the cover of this book SJ Watson calls it  Gripping  enthralling   a top notch thriller and a compulsive read   I agree 100 I simply could not put this book down It is well written   tight  tense and thrilling all the way  Reading it is like riding a roller coaster Who is telling the truth Who is lying Rachel  an emotionally unstable alcoholic who has recently lost her marriage and her job  rides the train to London every day  keeping up the pretence she still has a job Everyday she passes the back of the street where she used to live   when she was married   and every day she looks She makes up stories about the people in the houses   one couple in particular  Then one day she sees something  something that changes the way she sees these people and that will involve her in their lives A compulsively readable  emotionally immersive  Hitchcockian thriller  this is an electrifying debut  Paula Hawkins I wait impatiently for your next book I have read some really good books this year  but this is far and away the best  Another good read   one of the crop of psychological thrillers being talked up these days It has been likened to Gone Girl and there are similarities with the structure of the book  and the subject matter to an extent  The story is told in first person but from 3 differing participants  viewpoints  Each chapter alternates between these viewpoints  sometimes only switching between 2 of the narrators in consecutive chapters though  and some of the timelines are slightly different   but they converge towards the end One of the main characters  Rachel Watson  comes across as not very likeable as she has a drink problem and for that reason  as she herself admits  her recollection of events is unreliable so you re never quite sure when reading her bits if it is truthful  In fact  with reading the three different narrators you generally get that person s view of the  truth  rather than necessarily what actually happened As is usual with these books  there is a twist towards the end  can t say too much without revealing it  and the differing viewpoints converge as the story reaches a climax  Part way through this I was inclined to give it a 4 star rating  marked down because of the unsympathetic Rachel  but as you can see  I ended up giving it 5 stars because the tension and thrills picked up in the final 15  of the book and you also realise that Rachel was being manipulated throughout most of the book  so she garnered more sympathy by the end of it I can imagine this book being picked up for film or TV adaptation at some point  So good  Literally couldn t stop reading and couldn t figure out the ending   Crazy characters that you hate  worry about and lots of open ended things that don t make any sense until they all make sense in the end  Totally suspenseful and worth the read   This book  this book  I admit that I loved it  but I almost feel twisted for loving it  Literally every character was an absolutely loathsome human being  There was not one  likable  character in the whole story  and yet I liked them all  I appreciated their flaws  even with how utterly horrific they were  It s obvious to me that the author either knows a great deal about psychology  psychological disorders  and addictions  or else she did her research very well  I feel as though she created characters with flaws that almost all of us can relate to in one way or another  Maybe not so extreme as the characters were  but relatable nonetheless  Addiction  vanity  dishonesty  promiscuity  anger management issues  attachment disorders  It was all present  And I found myself totally repulsed and simultaneously totally engrossed by it all  It was a worthy read  I feel  I d recommend it to my friends   When I read a few reviews prior to reading this book  I immediately became excited that it was compared to Gone Girl  I ve never read the book because I saw the movie first   big mistake   but I still enjoyed the movie  At first  I thought Rachel might have been behind Megan s death  Then I thought   that s way too easy   As the story focused on Anna and Tom  I knew one of them was behind the murder  I wanted so badly to think it was Anna because I couldn t stand her  Lol  The characters in this story were so messed up and troublesome  but I think that s what made it awesome  Definitely a great thriller   I couldn t put this book down  I have seen reviews that compare it to Gone Girl  but I found it much more appealing  Unlike Gone Girl  initially unlikable characters became more likable  or at least understood and believable  as the story unfolded  Not only was it a true thriller   a page turning experience unlike one I ve read in a long while   but it also brings attention to the various reasons why people sink into depression  turn to alcohol  and become obsessed with what is going wrong in their lives to the point of self destruction  A strong theme in the book dealt with the effects that abuse has on people  and how often the  silent  type of emotional abuse can be the most destructive of all  I look forward to the next thriller by this author   This was a fantastic book recommended by a fantastic reading friend  Kate Harris  The story is ever evolving and is entwined in the lives of several people  The main character is the girl on the train but what she sees as real life and what actually is true is what makes this an interesting read  I was not in the mood for reading but once I started I could not put this book down  This books draws you in and you just want to know what happens next but what actually happens is not what you could predict and the more you read the more intrigued you become   unbelievable book  I probably experienced every emotion available to the human body  I just have no words how incredible this book was for many reasons  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  This book was referred to me by numerous people and I had a hard time putting it down  Although it was a tad bit easy to figure out who the killer was  I was taken through twists and turns that made me rethink my decision constantly  I did get pissed at Rachel numerous times because I couldn t understand her stupidity but she was believable despite her actions  I will pass it along and start referring this book to my friends   This was a much faster paced and creepier Gone Girl  A book completely filled with secrets and lies  no one in this book can be trusted  With three very messed up and complicated women at the heart of this novel  the story instantly has a great amount of depth and deception  I was drawn into this book very quickly and wanted to know more instantly  it was a real page turner  This was a very cleverly crafted thriller  with all loose ends tied up  I was left guessing right up until the killer was revealed which I really enjoyed  I loved the constant guessing and mistrusting of each character chapter by chapter I felt the ending was slightly flat compared to the rest of the book  the rest was full of suspense and drama  and my opinion constantly changed on the characters throughout  After everything was revealed I thought something much more dramatic would happen  I don t know why but I expected more  saying this  I would definitely read another Paula Hawkins   Just finished this book and oh my forget 5 stars   50 stars    These characters will be on my mind for a bit  That  Was amazing   Um espectaculo  Completamente inebriante  Uma leitura que nos agarra do principio ao fim e em modo crescendo     Personagens magnificas e reais  uma historia super bem desenvolvida e coerente e uma forma de escrever fantastica   I finished this book in one afternoon  It s been a while since Ive devoured a book like that  I saw this book had 38 000 reviews on Amazon and decided to give it a shot  It captured me from the first page and I was hooked  I love that feeling  The story twists and turns but it takes you right along for the ride  Fast enough to keep your constant interest but not too fast that you can t keep up  You never quite know where the story is taking you  Paula Hawkin s debut novel was exceptional  I see a movie deal for this book in her future   A great read  And a good ending  was honestly not expecting the killer to be that person  Glad I saw this one and picked it up to read  I absolutely loved this thriller  I give it a five thumbs up and more   The plot is weaved into the story in such a way as to keep you reading as fast as you can till the very end  I loved the way the author uses the people she sees while on the train as part of the story  Very imaginative as we all tend to do this about others from time to time  thinking of how their lives are compared to our own  The writer really intrigues us with the plot between the imaginary characters that she creates while on the train and the Real characters  what a difference  Also her drinking problem adds to the mystery of this book  and what she really Did when she was drinking  Did she perhaps commit the murder in a drunken state  What did she really do with the red haired stranger  All in  all I really enjoyed it  and I could certainly see this as a great movie plot  Can t wait to read another suspense story from Paula Hawkins   Bravo    This is one of those books that I found it hard to like any of the characters  however  the story is amazingly well told and I couldn t put the book down   A page turner  I read it in 2 days   Full review on my blog   Accio Reviews   Wow  Wow  Wow This is one of those cases where I will be struggling to put together a coherent review Not only because this is a brilliant book but also due to the fact that I believe you should go into the reading of it as blind as possible and I don t want to give too much away This story is told through three different points of view  Rachel  our protagonist  and two other women  which I won t be getting into much detail of who they are  since  you know  spoilers   Two of them are concurrent as for timeline  at the beginning of each  chapter  there is an indication of what day it is to help you keep up   while the third begins about one year earlier  As you read the book you should take this into account  because every detail matters and that look into the past is filled with clues and a privileged perspective into the characters at play The biggest compliment I can give this book is that it was the most brilliantly executed  show  don t tell  that I have read in a long time  You get to know all of these people by the little things they do or say  and all of their personalities slowly form in front of your eyes  instead of having paragraphs and paragraphs of exposition just to get that out of the way  As a writer  I will definitely be looking back to it as an inspiration I did  however  end up the tiniest bit disappointed because I guessed what the ending was going to be halfway through reading the book  but since I rarely get these things right I just kept waiting for a plot twist that never came  It doesn t hurt at all my rating of it because it still was an amazing read and a great  insightful look into first impressions and what people really are behind closed doors  You think you know someone but you might be sorely  dangerously mistaken For fans of Gone Girl and Before I Go to Sleep  this thriller will keep you at the edge of your  possibly train   seat until the very last page  A little bit about me  I love March Madness  I especially love the opening Thursday and Friday games   ahh the upsets  I enter multiple pools and cheer on random college teams that I know next to nothing about  Now how does this relate to The Girl on the Train  Well this past weekend was the opening weekend of March Madness   32 games within 2 days starting on Thursday  And how did I spend my Friday night   reading The Girl on the Train  That s right  During one of the greatest sporting events of the year  I was curled up on the couch reading Girl on the Train  I just couldn t put this book down  There was the mystery aspect that I really enjoyed  but the thriller part just hooked me  I figured out the mystery about half way through  but the ending and the tension just kept going and I couldn t tear myself away  The characters were flawed  but at times I just wanted to be friends with them and be there for them  Overall  I loved it  As a fan of thrillers  I would suggest this novel to those who love thrillers as well  especially Before I Go to Sleep  This was so much fun to read  While the  twist  at the end wasn t nearly as  twisty  as the jacket blurbs would have had me believe  it was quite a ride to get there  The main characters  and there are a handful  are delightfully  interestingly damaged   each in their own way  The story is doled out   in bits and pieces  and not chronologically   by the three women  Every one is unreliable  But  in a major difference from Gone Girl  to which this is being compared   unreliable does not mean unlikeable or unsympathetic  I liked these characters   well  most of them  Hurray Paula Hawkins  for creating such compelling characters and then setting them in such a roller coaster of a story  and then keeping such precise control of them  If you liked Gone Girl  read this  If you didn t like Gone Girl  read this anyway   it s much more satisfying  Just make sure you have a free afternoon when you start  You re not going to want to put this one down   One of the best books I ve read  It is a fast  nail biting exciting read that walks the reader through emotional roller coasters of life  I don t want to include spoilers b c it would ruin the read  All I can say is that Paula Hawkins is my new fave author    Wowza  I loved this book  Read it very fast considering my current schedule  It s kinda dark  kind of confusing at times  but the confusion is intentional and propels the story at lightning speed  I always felt that I had one foot in the truth and one foot in the ether  A masterfully written story  in my humble opinion  The ending is a doozy and though it was likened to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn  a fave author of mine   I think I actually liked this better  The characters are endearingly unlikeable  The plot dark and muzzy and almost dreamlike at times  I ll definitely be picking up Paula Hawkins future works based on this novel  I highly recommend it   4 5 stars  I read this book in under 2 days  so one day basically  My favorite thriller of the year  right up there with Gone Girl  It s impossible to put down  If you re looking for something to get you out of a reading slump then this is it These characters are all terrible in their own way  I would NOT want to be friends with any of them    but at the end of the book I came to appreciate the strength and determination of the female characters  7th and 8th graders  This probably isn t for you  I doubt I d want my middle schooler reading about this  It s mature and deals with alcoholism  murder  and sexual themes  However  parents of students  what a ride this book was  At first it was a little slow  like a train chugging away from the station  Eventually  the pacing picked up  You love to hate Rachel until  miraculously  everything changes  I loved what a complex relationship she holds with those around her  her judgmental roommate  her ex husband and his new wife  Megan and Megan s husband  Scott  I also was tragically invested in Megan s story  feeling myself root for her all while assuming the worst  Read it  Love it   Disturbing  maddening  great original story  I plowed through it  Like I said before  it was a little like Gone Girl  but there was a train  None of the characters was very likable so it was hard sometimes to care what happened to them  Then Rachel  the protagonist  nosed out ahead of the pack and displayed both ingenuity and courage  I like the way the story was told in the voices of the three women and this way of telling the story became very significant in the end   I won t say any more about it because I don t want to spoil any surprises   I was sad to finish it because the plot picked up speed near the end and I couldn t put it down  The life lesson learned in the end is   Just like the horse  after you fall down  you have to get back on the train   http   viv omundoencantadodoslivros b   Antes de dar a minha opiniao  gostaria de agradecer a TopSeller por me ter dado a oportunidade de ler este livro ainda antes de sair no mercado  Foi uma oportunidade fantastica e a qual espero que se volte a repetir  Ja conhecia os ARC  Advanced Reading Copy  atraves de outros blogues estrangeiros e verificar que as nossas editoras comecam a desenvolver o mesmo tipo de atividades deixa me muito feliz Agora  em relacao ao livro   OHMEUDEUS     Este foi um livro completamente alucinante  Acho que  cada vez que fizer uma viagem de comboio  nunca mais irei olhar para as casas a beira da linha da mesma forma  Uma palavra para o descrever  Viciante  E  por mais que procure  nao encontre uma unica parte em que possa dizer mal da historia ou dos seus personagens Na minha opiniao  Paula Hawkins criou uma historia fantastica e que nos prende desde a primeira pagina  Sendo que a conjuncao entre essa historia e o misterio que envolve vao se tornando  ao longo do livro  cada vez mais envolventes e fazendo com que o leitor se sinta mais e mais absorvido pelo que se esta a passar  O que posso dizer e que a leitura acaba por ser feita de uma forma quase compulsiva  em que o leitor quase nao consegue parar de ler e a vontade de saber o que se vai passar a seguir vai aumentando a um ritmo completamente alucinante Para aqueles que ainda nao sabem  o livro estara a venda a partir do dia 8 de Junho  Nao queiram perder este comboio  comprem o livro e entendam da melhor forma tudo aquilo que tenho estado a dizer  Acreditem que nao se irao arrepender  I read fluffy wuffy  sweet kitten like books usually  chick lit  or Ooooh vampires  Werewolves  you get my gist   This was nothing like that this is nothing like any of the books I like  In fact  thriller  would usually make me go nope  Not into things like that  but this one   this one has changed my mind  This book kept me absolutely hooked  it wasn t scary in a cover my ears and sing a disney tune it was scary in a ooooh this feels eerie but whats going to happen next  I spent my day wondering what was going to happen until I could get back to it  Rachel gets the same train every single day of her life she goes past the same peoples houses she watches everyday who are sitting outside eating breakfast she begins to imagination what their lives are like and what they do and how they feel  They are the perfect lives  Something she does not Are they really all that perfect though  Rachel witnesses something and informs certain people of that something  Has she done the right thing  or has she done more harm than good   Sin palabras  este libro arrasa todo lo que tiene en su camino  al igual que un tren El final  inesperado Sin duda alguna  el mejor libro que lei este 2015  Loved this book  Could not put it down  Fantastic storyline and fast read   75  through this book  Was a slow start for me in getting into this book  Have so many different feelings going through me while reading this book  There s a dark side to the story that gives me a very weird feeling that I can t explain  I feel so bad   sad at the same time for Rachel   Megan  And I myself am thankful for my normal  boring  life  I already know part of the ending of the story because I peeked  It s a surprise  no spoilers here  I m admittedly not a fast reader  but I m trying to read this book as fast as I can  Can t wait to get to the end  even if I do sort of know the ending   A must  read    This was incredibly good  It dealt with issues like domestic abuse  alcoholism  and not being able to get pregnant in a way that felt very raw to me  It was a little slow to start  but once the main plot started it really took off and I was completely engrossed  Highly recommend to those who enjoy thrillers   worthit Das Cover Zu sehen ist der Titel des Buches in einem verschwimmenden Weiss  Im Hintergrund ist ein Zugfenster mit dem leichten Umriss einer Frau zu sehen  was den fahrenden Zug symbolisieren soll  Ich finde  es ist ein recht  hektisches  Cover  das aber auch zur Geschichte passt  Schon ist auch  dass das Cover vom Original ubernommen wurde Die Geschichte Jeden Tag fahrt Rachel mit dem 08 04 Uhr Zug von Ashbury nach Euston  Und so gut wie jedes Mal sieht sie das Parchen von Haus Nr  15  Jess und Jason  wie sie die beiden nennt  auf der Terrasse  Rachel stellt sich vor  dass beide zusammen eine perfekte Beziehung fuhren  Doch eines Tages sieht sie Jess einen anderen Mann kussen  Rachel ist schockiert  doch es kommt noch schlimmer  Einen Tag spater ist Jess  die in Wirklichkeit Megan heisst  spurlos verschwunden  Rachel lasst diese Sache keine Ruhe und mischt sich in die Ermittlungen ein  Denn Megan scheint keine Vorzeigevergangenheit gehabt zu haben  Doch welcher Polizist glaubt schon einer alkoholabhangigen arbeitslosen Frau  die ihren Ex Mann und deren neue Frau stalkt und selbst einmal in der Strasse des Verbrechens gewohnt hat Meine Meinung  Girl on the Train  wurde mir von einer Arbeitskollegin und Freundin empfohlen  sodass sie es mir auslieh  damit ich diesen spannenden Thriller auch entdecken konnte  Ich hatte schon ein bisschen was von dem grossen Hype gehort  der um dieses Buch gemacht wurde und war sehr gespannt  Los geht es mit Rachel  die jeden Tag um die gleiche Zeit mit dem Zug fahrt  Sie entrustet sich  als sie sieht  dass der weibliche Part ihres taglichen Vorzeigepaares einen anderen kusst und am Tag darauf spurlos verschwunden ist  Naturlich wird nach ihr gesucht und auch Rachel meint  etwas dazu beitragen zu konnen  um Megans Morder zu fassen  Leider ist sie nicht unbedingt glaubwurdig  denn sie trinkt gerne ein Glas  oder eine Flasche  zu viel  benimmt sich dann wie eine Verruckte und hat Aussetzer Blackouts Die Kapitel sind mal aus Rachels  mal aus Megans und mal aus Annas  der neuen Frau von Rachels Ex Mann Tom geschrieben  Auch sind immer Datumsangaben  z  B  Freitag  12  Juli 2013  sowie Tageszeiten  morgens oder abends  angegeben  was mir das Lesen am Anfang erschwerte  aber im Verlauf der Geschichte wichtig war  Auch wenn ich nicht so wirklich der Thriller Fan mehr bin  hat dieses Buch mich absolut begeistern konnen  Ich habe immer mitgeratselt  wer der Morder sein konnte und war geschockt  als immer wieder Teile von Megans Vergangenheit enthullt wurden  Nach und nach setzten sich die Puzzleteile zusammen und ergaben ein grosses Ganzes  Fur mich war  Girl on the train  wirklich ein sehr spannender Thriller  den ich verschlungen habe  Einfach top Meine Bewertung Mit  Girl on the Train  hat Paula Hawkins einen super spannenden Thriller Debutroman erschaffen  der mich bis zur letzten Seite gefesselt hat  Nichts ist so  wie es scheint  Fesselnd  spannend und uberraschend  Absolut verdiente funf Sterne  What I liked about this book was that the narrators weren t entirely reliable or likeable  One of my favorite lines comes from Rachel  who is battling alcoholism  She says   How much better life must have been for jealous drunks before emails and texts and mobile phones  before all these electronics and traces it leaves   The first person narrators don t have distinctive voices  so if you put the book down in the middle of a chapter  it will take you a second to figure out who is talking  you can figure out if it s Rachel if she s talking about how much she wants a drink  for example   All in all though  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will recommend it to friends because I couldn t wait to come back to it to find out what happened  and I wasn t disappointed  AwesomeDefinitely recommend  Thoughts it was a great book look forward to movie coming out  Lost a lot of sleep staying up to read  Dear Paula Hawkins Please make this a movie  It would be fantastic  Sincerely Couldn t Put It DownI read this book in 2 days because I couldn t put it down  The Girl on the Train begins with Rachel  who it seems  has her life together  She goes to and from work every day on the commuter train  We soon find out she s not quite got it all together and is an alcoholic who suffers from blackouts  Then there s Megan  Megan s a restless unhappy insomniac who just can t be content with her perfect husband  Finally  is Anna  Anna has the perfect life and family  When we begin to find out how these lives are interwoven we re plunged into a rabbit hole there is just no getting out of  I highly recommend this book  Jaw dropping   Mind blowing    Not what in was expecting at all    So worth every penny I spent to read this book  I m not going to give any spoilers but  I will say that if you try to figure it out you won t just let the story flow  and don t judge this book by the cover or you will miss out an amazing story  I could not put this one down  Paula Hawkins is a very creative writer  weaving a story with twists and turns that are original  While I see the parallels with Gone Girl and agree that the genre is the same  the story line is very different  The main character  Rachel  is an alcoholic and she is a bit crazy  but the reader can empathize with her pain and neediness because she is lost and not unkind  could not empathize with any characters in Gone Girl   You just want to shake her throughout the book  and want her to snap to her senses  Rachel feels that she is acting in good faith  which makes her likable  even though her involvement in the plight of Scott and Megan is way over the top  Paula Hawkins method of revealing key information over the course of the book is the true art of this story in my opinion  She continued to surprise me throughout  although after each surprise I thought to myself  well  I should not have been surprised by that     This book is such a treat  you don t want to miss it  I ve already lent my copy out and have promised it to a couple of other friends because I enjoyed it so much  Minner meg om Gone Girl  Creepy og underholdende  En bok fylt med triste skjebner  Tror knapt det finnes en eneste stabil person i denne boken  Synes Hawkins skriver godt  Jeg lot meg hvertfall rive med  I read a sample of this book when it first started getting popular and I couldn t get into it  The sample was the first 20 or so pages and I was bored out of my mind so I passed on buying it  I read some other reviews that were pretty critical  Some have said the book is a waste of time others have said its a tedious glimpse into the lives of some messed up characters and one review said that if you REALLY like to read you ll HATE this book  That being said I gave it a second chance and I m so glad I did  It went on sale one day and I let my friend know since she had expressed an interest in reading it  She texted me a few days later gushing about how great it was  So  with nothing else on my reading list at the moment  I tried it again and suffered through the first 20 or so pages  I must say I really enjoyed it  The mystery kept me guessing until almost the very end and the prose flowed really well  I mean  its not Hemingway or anything  but it is a well written    well paced thriller that s perfect for the quickly coming chilly fall nights  Changing my review because the more you sit with this book the more you realize how good it actually is and i think its one of my favorites now I really liked this book  A lot of twists and turns   A good who done it type story that had me guessing for most of the book   I read this book in 24 hours because I couldn t put it down  I had to figure it out and I m usually pretty good at solving before the author reveals but this kept me guessing right up to the end  Someone wrote that they didn t like any of the characters  I liked them all  Very believable which is part of its magic  I will never feel the same about my train rides again  Holy  Cow  What an incredible  edge of your seat kind of book  This book reminded me somewhat of Gone Girl  but it was not as vulgar  If you love thrillers or mystery books that continue to keep you guessing then you should read this book  It was incredible  The first couple chapters were confusing for me  but I finally figured it out  Pay attention to the dates and also who the chapter is focusing on  hint  the name of the chapter is the name of the person that chapter focuses on     Great book  I loved reading this and would recommend it to anyone who loves a little psychological thrill  There s little to stay except that I was absorbed in this book as soon as I picked it up  While I understand it has a similar plot line to Gone Girl  this book is far superior  I couldn t get past the first 40 pages of Gone Girl  Hawkins carefully intertwines the story line of three emotionally vulnerable women who are able to overcome the abusive man they once loved  It s a roller coaster of a story told through enticing writing   Apesar de ler pouco do genero presentemente  um bom thriller psicologico sempre me fascina  E quando li a sinopse do livro A garota no trem  ele instantaneamente me chamou a atencao  E nao seria para menos  quando finalmente o peguei em maos  devorei em dois dias Como sintetizar tanta genialidade num enredo  Como resumir meus sentimentos em tanta verdade e profundidade numa narracao Vamos la    O livro e narrado em primeira pessoa e e alternado entre tres personagens chaves  Um quebra cabeca muito bem calculado desde a primeira pagina  E eu amei cada nova descoberta  cada pedacinho dessa genial charada muito bem harmonizada Paula Hawkins me ganhou pra sempre  Me apaixonei profundamente pela escrita dessa autora tao surpreendente O que mais me encantou foi a forma que a autora narra  Nao existe mundinho perfeito a caminho  Voce se depara com a realidade  a do vizinho  a sua  E tudo tao real  tao intimo  Eu senti o que ela descreve  eu reconheci a fraqueza  a dor  a fragilidade do ser humano  Eu captei a sensacao do vicio  nao porque eu me coloquei no lugar  mas porque eu tambem tenho debilidades  todos nos temos e Paula Hawkins foi extraordinariamente primorosa ao atingir o ponto exato da impotencia humana  Uma para tristeza  duas para alegria  tres para menina  Tres para menina  Fico empacada nas tres  Nao consigo passar disso  Minha cabeca esta repleta de sons  minha boca  repleta de sangue  Tres para menina  Posso ouvir as aves  as pegas rabudas    estao rindo  debochando de mim  um crocitar estridente  Um bando  Mau agouro  Posso ve las agora  negras contra o sol  Nao as aves  outra coisa  Alguem esta vindo  Alguem esta falando comigo  Veja so  Veja so o que voce me obrigou a fazer  Por mais que alguns personagens sejam dignos de raiva  as vezes ate nojo  eu nao consegui odia los completamente  Porque eles sao tao  tao humanos  Eu senti raiva sim  repulsa  claro  Mas em determinados momentos  senti muita pena  e tudo muito cru  verdadeiro e me vi completamente envolvida Quando eu acabei a leitura  fui pesquisar sobre o livro e descobri que   A garota no trem  ja vendeu quatro milhoes de exemplares e foi traduzido para 44 linguas  O livro esta na lista dos mais vendidos do  New York Times  ha 27 semanas  e no Reino Unido derrubou o recorde alcancado ha seis anos por  O simbolo perdido   de Dan Brown   Fonte  Jornal O Globo   E a melhor noticia  A historia vai virar filme      Simplesmente ADORO quando isso acontece   Preferi nao citar os personagens  nao quero sinalizar nenhum tipo de spoiler  E eu SUPER indico que voce leia  E uma leitura fluida e viciante  vale muito a pena MESMO  I purchased this book back when it was released  and only now have I gotten around to reading it  I really wish I had read it sooner  it was so good  I don t normally read creepy books like this  but I want to delve further into the genre after reading it The story is told from three perspectives  Rachel  Anna  and Megan  and all three of them are screwed up  some more than others  There is a lot of mystery surrounding them and their motives  so much so that you aren t sure if you can trust them  As a result  I became wary of everyone  even the secondary characters  and it made the story much more interesting and exciting  About halfway through I thought I knew what the outcome was going to be  but it turned out I was very wrong  I could never have picked the ending and was completely shocked when all was revealed  The characters in this story are believable and well developed  the plot is exciting and interesting  and Paula Hawkins is able to grip you right from the first page  and never let you go  even after you finish the last  It has shocking twists and turns throughout  and the multiple perspectives adds to the mystery and suspense that appears throughout the novel I highly recommend The Girl on the Train  for anyone who loves mystery and suspense novels  as well as people who want to delve deeper into this genre  Paula Hawkins has created a fantastic novel  and I can t wait to see what she does next  What a wild and crazy ride that was  Picked this up after reading they were making it into a movie and my favorite actor was rumored for one of the male leads  So  yes  I sat and figured out who was who before reading  Didn t really know the other actors  so just Jared Leto stuck in my head  I could see him in the role  Ensemble piece  Three female leads  two male  In the book the females alternate being the POV character  Full chapters  so there was no real confusion  Although  a nitpick  the chapters really needed to be numbered  not just labeled Rachel  Megan  or Anna Rachel is the titular girl on the train  On her morning and evening commute she passes the house she used to own with her ex Tom and his new wife Anna  She also passes a home where an attractive couple  Megan and Scott live  Rachel creates a story for the attractive couple who she dubs Jess and Jason  Turns them into the perfect couple with the perfect life  Meanwhile Megan is looking at the trains passing by  wishing to be one of the people traveling off on a new adventure  Jared is supposed to be playing Scott  The characters are all gloriously flawed  No one has the life they want  Possible spoilers  depending how sensitive you are    Something happens to Megan  She goes missing  And Rachel thinks she knows something from her train window impression of Megan and Scott s life  So she inserts herself into the investigation and befrending Scott  When Megan turns up dead  Rachel does her best to defend her new friend Scott  but her fantasies  lies  and drunken misrememberings catch up to her  While Rachel s story    and later Anna s story    move along the present  we get most of Megan s story in a parallel flashback       As for the movie Rachel Watson    Emily BluntTom Watson  Rachel s ex     Chris EvansAnna Watson  Tom s new wife     Rebecca Ferguson Megan Hipwell    Haley Bennett Scott Hipwell    Jared Leto  Instead many of other reviews  this book deserve 5 stars  It is a thriller that keeps you connected with the story and with the characters  By keeping all lines of possibilities on the events  despite the modest narrative  the book manages to build a web  with facts that will gradually linking  Of course  if you read the book with great expectations  they will end up being broken  It s not the kind of book that changes lives  a ordinary history  common characters  murder  many suspects  unpredictable course  The greatest merit of this book is a fluid writing that gives good reading pace  The greatest problem is the book is the attempt to narrate the fact s by first person  with each chapter corresponding to a different character  I took long time to realize that  and all narrators have almost the same point of view  I really didn t know what to expect when I started reading this book  I thought it was going to be a mystery about a girl who saw something while riding the train  It was not that simple  It was definitely more than a story about a girl on a train and what she saw  A reader may think they have the ending figured out before the end of the book but that is simply not the case  This book is an intense thriller where clues are not what they seem and neither are the characters  I honestly thought I would take my time with this book but I could not put it down   Wonderful thriller that keeps you guessing right to the end Rachel  alcoholic  ex wife of TomAnna Tom s new wifeMegan  babysat for Tom   AnnaScott  married to MeganCathy  Rachel s room mateRachel fantasises about the people in a house that she can see from the train as she travels to work  and continues to travel this route after she s fired   It s just down from the house that she used to live in with Tom  who now shares it with Anna and their child  Evie Megan goes missing and Rachel s fantasies lead her to Scott  Eventually her head clears and she starts seeing the whole picture  Tom was having an affair with Megan  who became pregnant  and he kills her  Rachel realizes how controlling and violent Tom really is  After a struggle with him where he nearly kills her  she rams a cork screw into his neck in self defence Anna makes sure he ll be good and dead Excellent read  Such a thriller  I read this book in 3 days  and could have read it in one sitting if I had the time  Paula Hawkins keeps you guessing the entire time  and never leaves you fully trusting any of the characters  You won t be bored with this one  Thought I had it figured out several times  It turns out I didn t  Well done trickery  I loved this book  I loved the fact that it was dark  that the narrator was unreliable  and yet I rooted for her  She wasn t so despicable  or pathetic  that I couldn t care about her  The suspense was well crafted  I was guessing for a long time  I did figure it out before it was revealed  but that didn t spoil anything for me because I still wasn t sure how it would all play out  I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes dark suspenseful thrillers  This book is written from three different viewpoints  the perspectives of 3 different women whose lives are connected  The first part of the book switches chapters between two of the women with the third coming in a little later  At the beginning it is not entirely clear how the main two female characters are connected and chapter by chapter the connections are revealed  I felt a touch frustrated about a third of the way through because of the deliberate confusion and lack of clarity created by the switching between characters  but this resolved and the story picked up pace and in the end I was anxious to read at every opportunity to find out what was going on and how everyone was connected I liked how all the different threads weave between the characters and despite none of them being particularly likeable  and all of them being very flawed  the characters were interesting and compelling  The climax is superb and I really loved the last page An excellent psychological thriller that I would thoroughly recommend  5  no maybe 10  or 100  IDK I  LOVE  THIS  BOOK  SO  MUCH My heart will always have a space for this kind of book  I mean  I love this genre so much  People might say that they don t like it compared to Gone Girl  but I don t care  I fucking don t care  this genre will always have a space in my heart Now about the book  This book has 3 POVs which are Rachel  Anna and Meghan  The plot is back and forth which makes me a bit confused because I didn t notice the date at first but after get used to it  I wasn t confused anymore Idk about you  but I ve already felt a thrilling sensation since the begining of the book  I can feel myself as Rachel eventhough I ve never had a husband ok that s weird  I always feel the excitement when I turned the pages one by one  When I finished a chapter  I didn t want to put this down  I didn t want to stop reading it  I enjoyed it  But again  I m a super duper truper slow reader  Although I found a book so thrilling  interesting and exciting I just can t finish it less than a week but trust me  if you love psychological thriller mystery suspense like me  you need to read this at least once in your lifetime Your slow reader Dyn  When deciding between 4 or 5 stars  I realised that I had to award the full 5 because when I started reading the book I loath the main character so much that I thought there would be no way she could be redeemed  I even wanted to rate the book a measly 2 5 stars just because the main character was so ugh   I also nearly stopped reading the book too    I only continued because the writing was great and the story was compelling  You wanted to know what happened  despite the deeply flawed main character  I was so glad to be proven wrong and to develop sympathy for Rachel and that she became likeable in the end  If she was a real person I would want her to succeed  Subsequently  I hit the 5 stars  It s a great read  Seriously one of the best books I ve read in a long time  Suspenseful and intriguing  Couldn t put it down  Highly recommend it  blG   nthwy  frh  srdt bwl hwkynz

me  you re sick of books being hailed as the next Gone Girl  Because a  they usually aren t like that book in any way that matters and b  they often aren t any good  period  And then comes The Girl on the Train   happy sigh   and you say   Oh my God  this time they weren t lying just to get sales   It s not often that I sit and read  I mean an undivided  sit down for a long period with no intention of doing anything but reading kind of thing  but I got about 75  of the way done with this and I just had to settle in for the long haul  And it was worth it  So worth it  At one point in the story  early on  I thought I was going to bail because of how some of the female protagonists  if anyone in this book is really that  I think the characters may all be antagonists LOL  were being portrayed  But after the fifty zillion twists to get to the end  I sat back and said   It all works   And immediately I started trying to figure out how the hell you would film this baby  I m sure she s sold the movie rights by now  If not  it won t be long I hate to say more because I don t want to spoil the ride for others  Have fun  is all I can say  and good luck sussing this one out beforehand  This book was really good  I liked it more than Gone Girl   C est un thriller  un roman a suspens que nous devoile l auteure  Dans la banlieue de Londres  nous suivons Rachel  qui chaque matin et soir prend le train pour Londres  a la meme heure   Elle prend donc pour habitude d observer une maison laquelle est habitee par un couple qu elle nomma Jason et Jess  ce couple parfait a ses yeux Cependant  un jour  Rachel decouvre que l homme se tenant pret de Jason sur leur balcon n est pas Jess    L illusion de ce couple    parfait    tomberait a l eau  Peu apres ceci  le journal indique qu une femme   Megan Wipwell a disparu  Cette femme   Jess Rachel est alors emmenee dans cette affaire   entre passe douloureux  present trouble et futur inexistant  nous restons aux cotes de trois femmes   Rachel  Megan et Anna  la nouvelle femme de l ex de Rachel  Que s est il reellement passe   Megan avait elle un amant   Qui etait cet homme a ses cotes  Une disparition  une enigme a resoudre entouree d autres problemes de la vie comme l amour  le divorce  l alcool  ou encore le souhait de devenir mere   Un roman addictif qui tient ses promesses   Un roman qui    nous fait tourner la tete    au sens positif  nous obligeant a vouloir decouvrir nous aussi la verite Je conseille alors cette lecture aux amoureux de romans policiers mais aussi aux amoureux des livres tout simplement   T his has got to be just about the best book i have read so far this year  The plot was very original in fact i have never read a book quite like this before  was quite beautifully writen the plot was one that kept you guessing right to the last page i would recommend this book to any fans of thrillers or contemporary fiction  I put this book on my Favorites shelf  and it is a first for me because it is an audiobook and it is on my favorites because of that  I so much enjoyed the three voices of Rachel  Megan and Anna  and through them the voices of the other main characters  It was a little weird yet fascinating when characters overlapped between the women and I got to  hear  how this character felt like that one  sounded  or felt towards them  It was a new sensation for me  getting that inside look of someone from another person s pov from an auditory perspective  This is only the second book I ve completely listened to and the first one with shifting perspectives with a different narrator for each one  I am thrilled with it  I will have to go back and read it one day  as the previous book I listened to I had read quite a few times already and had already connected to that way  The way this mystery pulls together in the end thrilled me  such winding and connecting but not where I expected   Keep in mind though  if you are an avid mystery reader that hardly ever ever read true mystery type books   Easily the psychologist Dr Kamal Abditch  last name might be off  but that is what it sounded like to me  was my favorite character   it was easy to fall in love with him from the one character s POV  view spoiler   Megan s   hide spoiler    Mostly though  I loved how the book is like life in that in the end  we all turn into the same thing  In the end  each of the women have been put into the  place  of the other  walks in the proverbial shoes of the others   even if it burns them to do it  Especially the ending  that I liked the best  but don t want to spoil   view spoiler   The end when Rachel has insomnia  like Megan  Though to an extent I feel like Rachel doesn t  deserve  the insomnia whereas a part of me totally felt like insomnia was something that Megan deserved  Though on the other hand Megan didn t at all  it was an accident that was handled wrong in all ways  An accident by a young girl  a young girl left without the mental emotional support she needed before  during and after the baby    hide spoiler   Definitely enjoyed and will recommend   Woah  This was so twisted but found myself engrossed with the characters and storyline the entire time  I had a hard time putting this book down  Lots of sad parts that made me think could realistically happen to someone  A few times there were predictable moments but I didn t care  Bravo  Paula Hawkins  this was a great debut novel and look forward to reading your next one      UNA POR LA PENA DOS POR LA ALEGRIA TRES POR UNA CHICA      FENOMENAL   TENGO QUE DECIRLO AL PRINCIPIO NO ME GUSTO MUCHO  PERO DESPUES FUE GRANDIOSO     WOW  what a mystery  This is a warning to clear your day  or a couple of days to read this book  You won t want to do anything else but read it to the finish  A friend of mine calls books like this NCT   No Chores Today  This is definitely a NCT book  The story is told from three female narrators  You can t trust or believe any of them  There are hints and teasers dropped all through the book  I didn t figure out the ending ahead of time  There are already many reviews out there that will summarize the story for you  so I won t repeat all that here  There is much tension in the plot  the readers  sympathies go back and forth between characters  Run  don t walk to your nearest bookstore or library to pick up this book then clear your day for a thrilling read  What an intense book  I can easily say it was the one I enjoyed reading most in 2015 and it s a definite page turner  The story is so intriguing and it made me think about the characters and the story all day   I loved everything about this read  The women in the book are so relatable  Their thoughts mirror many of my own about life  There is so much more depth to this book than the reader can ever imagine from the start  I love that each chapter is narrated by one of the three main women  Awesome awesome read Wow  Couldn t put the book down  A must read for anyone who likes thrillers  This book  was a little boring in the beginning  I am not going to lie about this one  but i still had faith that this book was going to somehow rock my world  and it did  This is what i would call the biggest psychological crime book i have ever read thus far  not only is Rachel a a woman hurt by her husbands infidelity  but she also blanks out  drinks a lot amd from time to time pops up in front of her ex husbands house  either just to be there  or i have no idea  its just crazy  Her ex husband Tom  is a total jerk  at the end of the book  Megan  is also another one as well  there were soo much secrets  too much to write i dont want to spoil anything  Hahha  This book was awesome though I absolutely loved it  It was very refreshing to read about adults  not teenagers  I found it very easy to indetify with Rachel or Megan  mainly because of their depression I guess  I enjoyed the tiny plot twists  they were very smooth and elegant  preparing the whole story for the ultimate plot twist  I couldn t put down the book which wasn t the best because I had my exam so I should have focused on studying but what can you do when there is such a good book like this  I liked how Paula portrayed the addiction  how many forms it can how and what it is like to live with these obsessions  And I also loved that she showed that nothing is perfect that seems to be perfect  no relationship is as happy or easy as it seems to be  I really  really liked it  And my dad even picked up the book to read   And I read it on the train so the joke has been made hahah   In the morning  I take the 8 04  and in the evening  I come back on the 17 56  That s my train  It s the one I take  That s the way it is  If you haven t heard about this book yet  trust me within the next few months you will The Girl On The Train is a thriller whodunnit nail bitter similar to works like Gone Girl  I enjoyed this more then GG because it was much more multilayered  It all starts with train commuter Rachel seeing something out her train car window that unsettles her  This alone  depressed  alcoholic decides to do something about it and unwittingly puts herself in the middle of a murder investigation  Rachel is sure she knows something and is desperate to be apart of events bigger then her own life  so she keeps going back in hopes to jog her blackout  booze soaked memory  Did Rachel have anything to do with Meghan Hipwell s disappearance  Did she see who killed her  One way or another  she won t stop until she discovers the truth Read this book  That s all I have to say  Read it  It s fantastic  I m sure it ll only be a matter of time before we hear of a movie deal for this  it s riveting   This was a thrilling page turner that didn t reveal its twist until the vital moment in the plot  It has been compared to Gone Girl  but I would actually say this is a better novel  The characters are more ambiguous and less archetypes  the writing is more literary  and the twist is more convincing  Also  there isn t the horrible rape politics that Gone Girl turned into a major plot point  The buzz around this book is totally worth it   WOW  Very well written mystery  When I put the book down  I couldn t wait to get back to the story to find out what the next twist would be  I m looking forward to reading more by this author  The Girl on the Train was everything I d hoped it would be  I was drawn in by the synopsis and by the reviews describing the author s Hitchcockian presentation of this thriller  The novel did not disappoint  The female leads are all sympathetic in their own way  particularly Rachel who  despite her alcoholism and self deprecation  actually makes for a quite likeable heroine when compared with Megan and Anna  We first see these two women as pristine ideals  from Rachel s perspective   although  that veneer is soon stripped away through the women s personal narratives  Just as the bleaker facades of the other characters are revealed as the novel progresses  we see Rachel s sincerity  her compassion  and her desperate need to be loved radiate through her drunken stupors  In fact  Hawkins novel acts as a vehicle for us to be reminded that all individuals are multifaceted  with loveable and despicable attributes  The delivery of the story is impeccably executed  Hawkins allots us just enough information to keep us on edge  keep us guessing and second guessing  I particularly liked Rachel s flashbacks and Megan s ambiguous recounts   The whodunnit isn t hard to guess if you re paying attention  but you ll be pleased that it s not a knock off or copycat of previously done gotcha endings  And even though I had the whodunit about halfway through the novel  there were still enough little surprises along the way to keep me riddled with suspense  I read until my eyes refused to stay open  and this novel was a delightful distraction from life  Truly awesome stormy weather reading  I only wish Hitckcock were still living so that if it was made into a film  it would be done right   Sin ninguna duda este libro a sido uno de los mejores que he leido en 2015  aunque no sea un libro lleno de personajes  es muy comodo de leer  la trama esta basada en como rachel a pesar de sus desorientaciones  y algunas lagunas mentales  intenta resolver el misterio que en el libro se desarrolla Rachel tendra un impedimento muy grande a la hora de resolver el caso ya que tiene graves problemas con el alcohol  especialmente con el vino y el gin tonic  esta presencio el misterio en el momento en el que sucedieron algunas cosas extranas  pero gracias a que en este momento esta ebria  no recuerda mucho y a medida que avanza la historia va teniendo algunos flashbacks y con esto va conectando la historia Creo que se

testa sulle spalle  Non posso  Non con te  LA RAGAZZA DEL TRENO di Paula Hawkins e un thriller psicologico  tendente al giallo  con una struttura narrativa avvincente  La mente nasconde sempre moltissimi segreti  Anche quella della protagonista  Rachel  abituata a spiare le vite degli altri per non riflettere sulla propria  E sola  Divorziata  Ogni giorno prendere il treno  la mattina per andare  il pomeriggio per tornare dal lavoro a Londra  Il viaggio in treno e il suo momento preferito della giornata  Seduta accanto al finestrino  puo osservare le vite degli altri e fantasticare  Nessuno la vede  Nessuno sa di essere spiato In particolare  le piace spiare una coppia  un uomo e una donna  senza nome  che ogni mattina fanno colazione in veranda  Rachel da loro dei nomi  si affeziona alla loro routine  che un tempo aveva anche lei  quando era sposata con il suo Tom  Per lei  quella coppia di estranei rappresenta la coppia perfetta dalla vita perfetta  La sua vita invece e tutt altra cosa L apparente tranquillita su cui poggia la vita di Rachel viene rotta  una mattina  quando su quella veranda  vede qualcosa che non avrebbe dovuto vedere  Quel momento rappresenta per Rachel lo spartiacque tra la serenita e lo sconvolgimento totale  Rachel deve analizzare anche se stessa per comprendere cio che ha visto e che non riesce piu a ricordare A narrare le vicende sono tre donne  Rachel  Anna e Megan  nei loro diari  Ogni giorno il lettore puo scoprire cosa hanno fatto  I piani temporali  pero  sono differenti  cioe non seguono l ordine cronologico  ma distribuiscono eventi  elementi e dettagli per accrescere la curiosita di chi legge e scopre l evolversi degli eventi  una pagina dopo l altra  saltando da n periodo all altro  Questo meccanismo cattura il lettore  man mano che vengono disseminati indizi e delineate situazioni  Una suspense crescente accompagna le azioni della protagonista  mentre cerca di ritrovare i tasselli mancanti alla sua memoria  Lei ha un grave problema di alcolismo e la mancanza di lucidita le crea confusione nei pensieri e nei ricordi  Rachel e una donna abbandonata da tutti  ma tenace nel voler salvaguardare l ombra di perfezione che vede negli altri Il ritmo della narrazione diviene man mano piu incalzante fino allo sconvolgente colpo di scena  I misteri della mente umana sono tanti e non sempre chi appare equilibrato lo e davvero e viceversa  I finished reading it in two days and that only mean one thing  it s a keeper  loved  loved  LOVED    Couldn t put it down to the point of insanity  That is all Actually  that s not all  I m kind of amazed by what this book did  I see other reviewers are disgusted by the portrayal of women in this book  and I hear that  About halfway through  I was right there with those reviewers  Frustrated to have all these female characters who  if they re not crazy about having babies  they re crazy about not having babies  as if that s all that defines us  All we are  If babies make us crazy  and lack of babies makes us crazy  well  then I guess we re all crazy But this line stayed in my head while I read on      let s be honest  women are still only really valued for two things  their looks and their role as mothers  And then I got to this one   I m well aware there is no job more important than that of raising a child  but the problem is that it isn t valued  I realized  the farther I got in  that all these limitations on the women is all done on purpose  That the theme here isn t how women naturally are  but how women become when we re treated as things  as birthing vessels  as objects to use and discard  What happens when we re lied to  betrayed  abused  abandoned  How we cope due to that  What we learn to do to avoid it  And how all too often we re working against each other  the world our enemy  And if we d just team up  we could be so empowered I guess that s the big picture I m getting out of this  The other side to it is how strong and twisted and wildly entertaining this book is  how impossible it is to put down  how I stayed in an uncomfortable neck pain position for a very long time because I couldn t interrupt my reading to move to the couch that was three feet away  How  oh I ll just read 15 more minutes and then go do some things I need to do  turns into flipping one more page for two hours until I finish  Because every 15 minutes is 15 minutes deeper into a tunnel that you can t turn around in  you must keep going  walking  then powerwalking  then jogging  then running  Until the end  Phew  What a book  Loved this book  the narration and characters  This was so hard to put down We follow the story of a girl on a train  no spoilers there     who  at the same point in her journey every day  peers into the lives of two couples whose houses back onto the train tracks  An innocent enough situation for our protagonist to be in  However  as the story begins to unravel we learn more and more about the girl on the train and the people that she observes and our views continually shift as the plot twists and turns Paula Hawkins is one of those writers that has great skill in giving the reader just the right amount of breadcrumbs to keep them on the trail  but not enough to see where they re headed  This novel kept surprising me until the end and was a lot darker than I first thought  A great read  So good  I couldn t stop reading it   Wow what a read  I can t believe that this took me two days to read because I honestly didn t want to put it down at all  but unfortunately the world must carry on regardless of me wanting to stick my head in my book  Such messy characters in this book  all with their own issues and problems but there were moments when I liked each and every one of them even if it was for a very short period in the story  I really empathised with Rachel through the whole book  First being unable to conceive and then your husband shipping you out before shipping a replacement in within days   how does anyone pick themselves up right away and move on from that   For this reason I never felt negatively towards her  I just felt sorry for her struggle  I didn t manage to connect with Anna very much I found her a little heartless at times but my opinion of her at the twist ending did change  Fab  whodunnit  book that kept me intrigued and hanging on right until the very end  I would love to see this on either the big or small screen  I think it would make a brilliant drama or film and translate really well  Well deserved 5 s from me    A well crafted thriller  I became a cave dweller  and didn t leave the book for much more  than provisions  and self care  It was like being on a runaway train  not knowing where it was going  The twists and turns of the track taking you to another dimension of the story  Loved it  Paula Hawkins have proved herself to be a master story teller  Congratulations  full review at https   shesreading wordpress comHOLY CRAP  THIS WAS SOOO GOOD GUYS I thought the beginning was a tad bit slow just because not much was happening plotwise  But then I didn t even noticed how much I didn t want to put this book down until I HAD TO  damn you  work  I was expecting something much different than what the book actually delivered  Every review said it was almost exactly like Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn  which I loved but I didn t want to read a copycat book  you know I thought the multiple person narrative worked excellently for this book  I thought I would get confused  but it easy to notice a difference in the voices  And even if I was confused  having the narrators name at the top of every page in the chapter would ve helped quite a bit  Also having the dates at the beginning of the chapter helped establish a solid timeline of events   I felt a bit like a detective double checking the time and dates while reading I did find the main character  Rachel  quite annoying during the majority of the book  She s an alcoholic and very self deprecating and every time she would lie about anything  I d cringe  But then I ended up loving her and her bravery after learning the reason behind her alcoholism during the conclusion of the novel A few of the other notes I took while reading  Is Megan framing the therapist Is it the red haired guy from the train station Why is Rachel so stupid  ugh I bet Tom is Mac Was Megan cheating on Scott with Tom  Word of advice  after finishing the novel  go back and reread the first two pages  Amazing context I highly highly highly recommend this book  This book is definitely going on my favorite books list  I can t wait to reread this whole book again and catch more stuff that I ve probably missed  Well  that probably have to wait until much later because there s other books that are just asking to be read   I finished the book in a week and I was like   Should I even say why I gave this book 5 stars  It was one of the best books I have ever read   It was perfect  I loved everything   The story  the 3 different narrators  the mystery  the back and forth  the plot twists  the amazing end    There was nothing that I did not like  I don t think that there is a book that can follow that It was The best psychological thriller I have ever read   Someone who loves thriller books and specially Stephen King s books should definitely read it  This is a 4 5 5  Very Hitchcock  Fast paced and suspenseful  Loved how the train motif permeated the stylization of the whole book  Would recommend to anyone looking for an easy  interesting  and fast thriller  MY only beef   why the      SPOLIER        killer really were the way they were  They were a pathological liar just because  The explanation was rather weak  but it didn t ruin my liking of the book   Fabulous thriller  The narration by the alcoholic Rachel is cringe worthy at times   found myself talking  yelling  out loud to her several times  Kept me guessing throughout the book  Girl On The Train is a mindboggling  mysterious twist that hooks you from the beginning  Paula Hawkins is very detailed with her writing which makes the 235 page book kind of slow  However  the story is so intriguing that it doesn t matter how slow it might seem  Hawkins brings to life main character Rachel  who is a divorced alcoholic  by having her try to piece together the many puzzle pieces that unravel throughout the story from her drunken blackouts  The book is also narrated by two other characters who play a huge role in piecing the puzzle to together known as Anna and Megan  I recommend this book to someone who enjoys being captured by small climaxes that lead to one unsuspecting peak  which keeps you guessing until the end  I gave this book 5 stars because as I was reading this book I kept wanting more  I wanted each character to expand their perspectives and get deeper into their feelings  and Hawkins did just that   Stayed up late two nights in a row because I couldn t put this down  Tight and taut and fraught with intrigue and danger  Best thriller I ve read since Gone Girl  this has great movie potential  Don t start it unless you have time to finish it because you won t want to put it down  A sort of modern day retelling of Rear Window with a nasty twist  It was a bit odd at first but quickly became a  can t put it down  read  Loved it  Great readNice book that had me on the edge of my seat near the end  Took awhile to get there  but I was not disappointed  Most people know about this book by now I guess although I have met a few over the last day or so who had not heard of it  It is very successful and I can see why  From the beginning it pulls you in  throwing out questions which you just HAVE to know the answers to  The three viewpoint characters are so well drawn that you forget that they are not real people and  for me  this is where the magic lies  Their world becomes yours  Utterly  There is enough detail of the everyday to make you feel as though you are there with them yet  somehow  not a word is wasted as the pace never lets up  The mystery at the heart of the novel is solvable  but that is part of the charm  You want to solve it  you need to solve it  almost as much as Rachel  And when it is finally unraveled it is satisfying  even if you did guess where it was heading  The delicacy with which the author reveals information and develops character is breathtaking  A great read  So  so amazing  This book keeps you guessing then totally blind sides you  I don t want to give a word of it away  just read it   Wow  Lige en bog for mig  Jeg har laest  at mange synes  bogen ligner Gone Girl  Kvinden  det forsvandt  og The Good Girl  Den perfekte pige   Det er jeg helt enig i  Sprog og stemning minder om hinanden i alle tre boger  men jeg nod denne bog og The Good Girl mest  Dejligt med en krimi  der er spaendende fra forst til sidst uden at det er nodvendigt at have et enormt stort  uoverskueligt persongalleri  Det gor ikke denne bog  og de to andre  mindre interessant  at man som laeser ikke rigtigt kan finde ud af  hvem man skal tro pa    og at alle personer er meget nuancerede og ikke umiddelbart nemme at forholde sig til   The first few pages of this book were dark and depressing  but hang in there      once you get inside the head of Rachel and Megan things finally take off    The main character Rachel is so raw  naive and vulnerable  She is so different from your typical  life is great  I am beautiful and rich main character  It was refreshing  The ending definitely had the best twists and is what makes the book so great   I could not put it down  Everyone is talking about how this book is like Gone Girl  This is a mystery thriller suspense drama and it is about a girl  But that is where the similarity ends  The book is told in three different women s point of view and they are all connected by one man  The main character is Rachel  She is a divorced alcoholic who blacks out whenever she is drunk  Then there is Anna and Megan  Megan goes missing and Rachel feels like she knows what happened to her but can t recall exactly what she witnessed  No one trusts her because she is an alcoholic and she doesn t even trust herself  Very moving and depressing story but it does end on a hopeful note  When I finished reading Gone Girl I thought Nick and Amy deserved each other but at the end of this book I really sympathized with the women  especially Rachel  An excellent read  Easily one of the best books I ve read this summer  I really liked this book  Interesting plot  kept my interest  was well written  and had just the right amount of twists and turns you want in a thriller  Great twists and turns   Loved it  Couldn t put it down   I finished this book in under 24 hours  it managed to bring me out of my reading slump and kept me intrigued the entire time  While reading  I kept thinking of ways the book was going to end and what the big twist was but I was wrong the whole time  I was quick to guess what was going to happen in Gone Girl  but with this book I had no idea what was coming  It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time and I couldn t put it down because I needed to know what was going to happen  So glad I picked this up   As an avid mystery thriller reader I suffer from the double edge of being able to figure out what s really going on before the author s unveiling  On one edge is the smug satisfaction of not being fooled  On the other edge is the disappointment of not being fooled long enough to really enjoy the book all the way through  What was interesting here at least for me was the fact Hawkins kept me guessing to the very end and it was not because there was some surprise new character at the end  or even a character who has remained on the margins  It left me feeling that I had been walking in the company of a killer for chapters and chapters without giving him her a second look  Ah a satisfaction that is so much better than being right  I really enjoyed this book  even though every character is despicable  drunkards  cheaters  abusers  busybodies  murderers  and liars  and some are a combination   I enjoyed it because it was suspenseful and the reader does not figure out who the murder is until the end  or at least this reader did not   The book is a suspense murder mystery in the same vein as Gone Girl  although not nearly as graphic or gory  and Silent Wife  although not quite as manipulative   The book is told through dueling narratives from the perspectives of the three main female characters  Rachel  a busybody  divorced drunk  She is probably the most pitiful of all the characters  Rachel s alcoholism costs her her job  but she continues to ride the train every day  making up stories about a couple she sees each day  When she observes something suspicious  the police don t consider her a reliable witness  Anna  the mistress  now second wife of Tom  She is completely without a conscious and feels no guilt for how she destroyed Rachel s life and is selfish and self absorbed  Megan  A bored  self absorbed housewife who cannot seem to get her act together  so she decides to have affairs to kill time  This move costs her her life  And then there is Tom and Scott  the two husbands of the saga  I listened to the audiobook and enjoyed the various British accents and some of the cultural differences  Overall  a good suspenseful story with very little blood and gore   Really enjoyed this book  Couldn t put it down Enjoyed it more than Gone Girl which I have seen it compared to  I did guess who done it about half way through but was still gripped by the story  Great read  Every once in a while there comes a book that changes how you see a category or genre   The Girl on the Train  is one of those  Fast paced and with an ever changing point of view between one of three different narrators  Rachel  the alcoholic ex wife  who is in the outs and looks at her past life with adoring eyes  Anna  the other woman  who stole Rachel s husband and new mother  Megan  artsy young woman  who is viewed by Rachel from the train as the idyllic wife in her dreams Rachel who passes her ex house spies on another couples life every time the train passes behind their house  She finds their lives idyllic and romantic  Until one day  something she sees shatters her dream  just to discover something gruesome has taken place  Being an alcoholic  she in not believed by the authorities and so begins her search of her memories in order to solve the mystery  As with most thriller mysteries  we can t tell you much detail without giving up the prize  But once you get started with the novel it is very hard to put down as you are kept guessing through out  The suspense on some parts is really good  You can even hear the  violin screech  from Psycho inside your head  Not that the narrators are worthy of trust Very recommendable   Loved all the twists in this book  Great crime drama  The Girl on the Train is at heart a mystery with an unreliable narrator  which can be frustrating  read  manipulative and annoying   What makes this work so well is that we re not actually sure how unreliable she is  We get told she is  and we have reason to believe the other characters  but we re not sure if we should believe them more than we believe her  It s very well done  It s also refreshing to see an everyday woman with everyday problems that aren t being laughed off or undermined by being over dramatised in a Bridget Jones kind of way  The mystery is really good  too   I m not surprised to see it s being considered for a film  The book is more thoughtful than you think it will be  ignore comparisons to Hitchcock  which aren t really relevant  and also very exciting   I read a review whose author said the ending was disappointing  and I couldn t see why  I thought this was really good  especially for a first book  No need to add my review to the thousands that have come before  Suffice it to say  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  It walks the thin line between reality and fantasy  and hovers above the deep dark abyss of alcohol induced black outs  where that line is even thinner A very enthusiastic four and a half stars  rounded up to five  Could not put this book down  Gone Girl with a pathetic main character  Hated her but liked her all the same  Wow  This is a real page turner  I saw someone review it as a faster paced Gone Girl  I would agree and add that it is less predictable and has much better characters  I literally had trouble putting it down for the last hundred pages or so because I just needed to know how it would end  Great story and very well written  Could not put it down  This is the first book in a while that I ve read cover to cover in a day  Highly recommended  Holy cow  That was completely unexpected  i loved every minute of it  4 5This is my one and probably only adult fiction book I ll read this year So this book was really good Don t expect too much action because there s none  It s a slow moving story that relies heavily on character development Hawkins geniusly plays with your mind and not in the obvious ways   view spoiler   I was a quarter of the way into the book until I realized that Rachel was unemployed  Hawkins relied on the assumptions of the human mind that makes us believe that when a person gets on a train in the morning and comes home on the train in the evening  that person is going to work  However  Rachel didn t have a job    hide spoiler  It is a true psychological thriller because as the reader  you go back and forth as to who you think dunnit  I will admit  I did have a guess and I was correct  My guess wasn t just a out of the blue  I was able to come to a conclusion based on the details of the story and I was confirmed based on the details of the story  I love it when an author leaves clues for the reader to figure out who dunnit Hawkins leaves little crumbs for the reader  Several of the characters had skeletons but they weren t revealed all at once I have two complaints  One is that women aren t portrayed in a very positive light in this novel  There are four women in the story and none of them were strong women when it came to men  not even Cathy  I know they all have their problems but one of them could have been stronger  This however is not the reason why I didn t give it a 5 The ending was a little anti climactic  Because 95  of the novel was good  I gave it a 4 5 Overall  I really enjoyed the book  It was exciting and it was written well  Wow what a great book  I finished in 1 day because I could not put it down  Great book   The Girl On The Train  is one of those books that you will either love or hate  I for one enjoyed it immensely The Characters were so messed up   all in their own sick way   that I couldn t put the book down  The concept drew me to the book at the very start and the concept was the thing that kept me wanting more  it basically got me hooked and I read the book in a day  I m not even kidding Yes  it was a slow start  but once you really got to know the characters and are well invested into the storyline I guarantee that you will want to find out what happens yet  The book itself plays with so many psychological factors and Paula Hawkins really brought across every character with so much detail and  care   with care I mean that although it is a rather short book  the characters are what make the book so great in my eyes  They re the centre of what drew me in  Yes  the storyline is suspenseful and has some great twists that I didn t see coming  but overall the history and personality of each and every person who is introduced to the plot is what makes the book what it is   thrilling and a great fun and non regrettable read  I really recommend this book  I read it a few months ago and sometimes still find myself thinking about the book  the characters and the storyline  THAT is what convinced me this book was not good  but a masterpiece  If the author somehow manages to burn this book storyline the twists  THIS GREAT READ into my brain and sub conscience  she s done something right  I have so much to say about this book and I don t even know where to start  Let me first off by saying that anyone who wants to read this book  first read Gone Girl  Read Gone Girl and then read this and then tell me if you can even compare the two because you can t  In so many ways this book was more intense  faster  and creepier than Gone Girl  But in an extremely good way  I personally didn t finish this book in one sitting  but if you wanted to  you could and you probably will if you have an entire afternoon to commit to this book  Actually  even if you don t want to use an entire afternoon  you will  I promise you will  From the beginning to the end  you just have no idea what will happen next  You have no idea which character you can trust and want to believe in  Honestly  you can t trust any of them  They are all corrupted and messed up in their own way and that s the thing that makes you dying to want more  You need more each time you turn the page  This is so engrossing and the minute you think you know what will happen  the complete opposite happens from beginning to end  It will keep you interested throughout  The story takes place with three female characters  and each time their perspective ends  you feel disappointed because you re so engrossed in what their perspective is that you don t care about the next character that comes up  I want to give spoilers but I can t  All I m going to say is that none of the characters can be trusted and that what happens in the end is the least expected and the entire story leads up to it  I ve learned that The Girl on the Train is supposed to be a film  and I already can t wait for it  Granted  novels that turn into movies are usually let downs but I am looking forward to this  This book has to be one of the best novels of 2015  Hands down  No contest because it is that good  Paula Hawkins cannot stop here with just this one story   Loved this book  A must read Paula Hawkins   The Girl on the Train  is a high speed ride in audioEarly reviewers of this novel touted it as the next  Gone Girl   However  as wonderful as Gillian Flynn s novel is  Paula Hawkins  train overtakes it well before the end of the line  Hawkins  time stamped structure of the story told in first person by three separate  but deeply entwined female main characters  lets the mystery unravel at just the right speed  The British accents of the three superb female narrators of the audio version of  The Girl on the Train  draw the reader  or listener  into the darkness of the unique tale and its unexpected climax  The voice inflections and diction variations between the jilted Rachel  jealous Anna  and twisted Megan are at times as mesmerizing as the prose  Alcoholic protagonist Rachel s memory lapses and her struggles with the disease are central to the story line and her human frailty is so exposed and explored that no reader could deny her empathy and sympathy The female narrators do an outstanding job as well with the voices and acting of the roles of the major male characters  Scott and Tom  and with the minor male characters such as the red handed man  Even if someone has read the print or digital version of  The Girl on the Train   I recommend listening to the audio version  too  After following the narrators  British accents and the colloquialisms  I well understand the fervor shared with millions over the television series  Downton Abbey        Darden Northwww dardennorth com And another 5 star  That s 2 in a row for me  I listened to this book on Audible  Narration was really good  I couldn t wait to listen     took the long way home from work      what  you need eggs from the store    Of course I can go  anything to listen longer     Twists and surprises     Bit of a slow start  especially coming off my last book  but it had me going right up until the end  Liked it better than Gone Girl   Amazing   When you start  you can stop until you get to the bottom of it  My Rating  4 5 stars  out of 5 It s breaking records on Goodreads  It s lengthy time on the New York Times bestsellers list has been raising eyebrows  Stephen King praises it  So what s up with this critically acclaimed suspense novel I purchased this book in its second week of success  I walked down hallways holding this book open with my thumb and pinky finger of one hand  eating with the other  At this page flipping rate  it didn t take long to reach the end  As a suspense novel  I think that makes it easy to be appreciated by a large audience  Not everyone likes romance  Not everyone like contemporary  Not everyone likes an adventure  But everyone wants to know what happens to the alcoholic girl on the train  whose imagination and ex husband sit in the small houses not far from a spot where the train stops everyday  Close enough for Rachel  this alcoholic of a protagonist to see through the windows  And she s the only one looking when something shocking begins the suspenseful  thrilling  tense and page flipping mystery in this book  Rachel is a character that anyone would be frustrated with in person  But that makes her character just a little more intriguing as you get to know her character  why she rides the train to an imaginary job every day and why she drinks herself to sleep every night  It s impossible to totally predict the ending of this book  Readers may suspect  but every chapter  every surprise  is another reason to doubt your guesses about who is responsible for the chaos in the small houses by the railroad tracks  The third person makes the plot even more suspenseful in that unique way only the third person can switch quickly from scene to scene  featuring different characters  Paula Hawkins is a talented writer   How else would she make it to the top of the New York Times bestsellers list  It s part of the requirements   I would say that the one thing that could create negative opinions about this book is that Paula Hawkin s writing is one of those styles that just appeals to some people  and not as much to others  Even if the negative reviews say it was the plot  I truly believe it just wasn t their writing type  Everyone has a writing type  It explains why so many people  asides from the sex readers  like Fifty Shades of Grey  It s probably why I liked Anna and The French Kiss so much  I recommend this book to any one who wants a good escape of a book  A book that ll have them on the edge of their seats  It s suspense  It stands at the top of the thriller genre  See more of my reviews here  The Writing Reader This was a very fast read for me  two days  and I enjoyed every minute of it  It has love  betrayal  mystery  murder and more  Rachel the  girl on the train  is a pretty complex character in that she is so self destructive with no confidence at all  but underneath all the layers you see the good in her and you find yourself rooting for her  All the male characters in this book were about as unlikable and intolerable as you can get  This book was compared to Gone Girl  which I have to agree with  which I happen to like a lot  Get it  Read it  Once you start  you will not be able to put it down  Oh dear  that was hell of a book  Gave me an anxiety  because in the certain moment I know something was going to happen  but it was a great read Characters which you hate  they are that well written  But in one moment they are get the likeable values  so  Story is keeping you fascinated  You just want to read  you know on each page there will be new discovery  and almost on every ending of the chapter there is a plot twist What an awesome read it was  I envy all of you who still will read it for the first time  The book was first class  However  the narrators were awful  Their attempts to pretend to be a man were like a terrible parody  and were desperately inconsistent  And the whole reading was over dramatic  Don t get the audiobook  but do read it in print  Best book I ve read in over a decade  Read it before the film comes out  This was so good and twisted  and towards the end I had to go back and reread bits from the beginning because they turned out to not be about what I had originally thought  Full of so many unreliable narrators  and no one is always telling the full truth  I had a hard time putting this down  I m glad I finished this book  Kind of boring at first  There is not a character you ll like  All of them have real bad qualities  But I found when I wasn t reading this book  I was thinking about it  You ll most likely be able to guess who the killer is   Fab fast paced book   Terrific thriller  I had read no reviews of this one before I opened it to read and I didn t realize that it was a thriller  However  I found the key character  Rachel  a quite ordinary individual who has reached a dismal place in her life  Divorced  she turns to alcohol and loses her job because of her drinking  In short  she is an alcoholic  To avoid her flatmate s discovery of the jobless state  Rachel takes the train every day into London as if she were going to work  She sits in a window seat and becomes fascinated by a couple she sees on their patio so often she feels she begins to know them and gives them names  One day she sees a strange man embracing the woman  When the woman disappears without a trace Rachel wonders what could have happened and becomes involved in the search for her  However  no matter what she finds who would believe an alcoholic who has blackouts  There is a twist to this story  Yes  I did determine what happened to the missing woman  and  in turn  why and who was involved  It s exciting and keeps the reader turning page after page  Rarely do I give a mystery thriller five stars but since I couldn t put this one down I chose to do so  See if you like it as much as I did   Want a thriller read done right  pick up The Girl on the Train  There  that is my review in one short sentence convincing you to pick it up  The Girl on the Train was a gritty  sometimes even uncomfortable like read  Rachel  the main protagonist  is so unlikable   actually  every single main character in this book is hateful  More than once I was disgusted by Rachel and I feel that is what made the book such a different experience for me  There is no clear indication on who you should be rooting for or who you can side with or who the hell to trust and confide in   shivers  this book really gave me the creeps  and I loved every single page of it  Granted  the beginning was slow  it took me a day or two to get to page 70 but right after we are finally up to what the synopsis reveals  you are officially locked in this game of lying  deceit  despicable characters  and suspicion  Told from an almost dual POV of Rachel and someone else  as well as their two differing timelines that will ultimately diverge  you can t help but run a 100 theories through your head trying to figure out where Paula Hawkins will take the plot  The pacing of the book and how only fragments of the real story and happenings and memories get thrown at us is what makes it such an addicting read  Rachel is a drunk  Like a complete and utter drunk  Everyday she wakes up saying she ll quit then drinks as much as humanly possible   whether it be morning  in the train  or even as soon as she wakes up in bed  As a result of that  Rachel has had her fair share of blackouts and lost memories   some very important memories that could solve the whole damn mystery  Rachel is not supposed to be a likable character  She frustrated and disgusted  3rd time already   me to no end  All I wanted to do was shake her and tell her to GET A GRIP and to hell with her cheating ex husband and to just  for God s sake  MOVE ON  Of course Rachel s demons aren t that easily fought   and so we trudge along  unwillingly may I add  through Rachel s worthless days   but that added to the gritty and chilling feeling of the whole novel  I don t think I ve read an adult mystery thriller as good as The Girl on the Train   I know it has been labeled as the next  Gone Girl  which I ve read  but I truly believe this amped up the suspense and thrill while keeping me engaged throughout the whole novel  While I was able to guess correctly on one point  the motive  and the execution of the crime as well as all the other memory holes are what kept me going  This is a brilliant thriller and I can t recommend it enough  I am interested to see what Paula Hawkins  next book will be and if it s another thriller that will leave me  days later  still thinking and obsessing about the characters and events that took place within the book s pages   The Girl On The Train has garnered a lot of attention from readers last year and I must say as a connoisseur of psychological thrillers it deserves all the hype  The author took an everyday thing we do  riding a train  threw in a person desperate for a release in her current reality so not unlike us everyday humans  and threw in a heinous crime that will curl around your head and live there  The complexity of the characters  how they were interwoven in the story gives it life  Take Rachel  the alcoholic who has an obsession for her ex husband who married the woman he cheated her with  Anna  who just wants to have the normalcy of a family  forever afraid of the shadow of her husband s ex wife who is showing signs of getting tired of the shit Rachel is pulling and getting angrier and angrier about it  Tom  the husband in question  trying to be the peace maker but standing firm that he has moved on and Rachel should too  Then there s Rachel s  Jess and Jason  as she calls them  The couple who lives near her old house and now where her ex husband lives with his family  She see s them be a couple and she makes it up in her head how perfect they are  how so alike they were when she and Tom were married  But in reality they have there own problems The story made me see that sometimes what under the surface is a much darker place  Sometimes what we see as happy is just one side of the story  that there could be an ugly side in an otherwise perfect life  How truth can be twisted by words  especially if it is from someone you trust  How not seeing past the exterior can be deadly This is a heart pounding and mind fucking book that will in all sense satisfy every thrill craving you have I recommend reading this book while on a train to somewhere not for any special reason but because you will feel a little bit closer to what Rachel experience  Look out the window  see the cars  houses and people passing by and try to imagine  make up the story  It feels really satisfying that way   Djan I d been meaning to read The Girl on the Train for a while   daunted by the fact that it had a similar title to one of my thrillers  Girl on a Train    which came out the year before  by the way   for those who have asked    I was also aware that the two books were getting mixed up by readers  as you might imagine Well   I finally got around to finding out what all the fuss was about   and Paula Hawkins  book is indeed a stonking good read  In fact  it is an excellent example of a psychological thriller with unreliable and damaged narrators and everyone in the book covering things up  telling lies  pretending  making assumptions and being unable to trust anyone   not even the police officers provide an oasis of safety  When I consider the actual storyline  it s relatively straight forward   based around a single crime  but it s the execution that is key  Paula uses every device known to authors in order to create a book that moves forward faster than the Eurostar and is extremely hard to put down  There are short alternating chapters with drama or conflict of some kind on almost every page  Every scene has something within it that  according to whichever of the three narrators is centre stage  is unexplained  or confusing or  not quite right   which leaves the reader with a perpetual sense of  what s going on   Have you ever used a  fitball  or wobble board at the gym  This book is like being on one of those   you don t know which way you re going to be tipped at any moment  There is a relentless tug around who the bad guy is   when all of the characters  apart from Rachel s flatmate   seem to be plotting  hiding something  sneaking around or behaving shamefully in some way Don t expect a smooth ride to the next stop   there s not a lot of time to admire the view  Not the kind of writing I would always want from a book   but I loved it  A woman who blacks out when she drinks too much watches people s lives from the train to and from her residence to London  Some people she sees so often she makes up names and lives for them  Other people she knows from her past and wants to alter their lives  When one of the people whose life she watches goes missing on a day she sees something from the train and on the night when she is in the area  the questions become how is she involved  does she know the person who may have done something  will anyone believe her  and can she save herself  We learn early on that she is an unreliable narrator and we can t believe what she tells us or what she thinks she knows  She lies to herself as well as to the other characters and to us   What a brilliant book  It was one of those that grabs you slowly reel you in  bit by bit  When it does  wow  you can t putt down The main character  Rachel  is not the traditional heroine  she s not particularly likeable   at first  We start reading her thoughts  her point of view  as she looks down on a row of houses from the train as she passes to and from work It turns out that it isn t just a row of houses as the story unfolds  The author leaves lots of clues  which you don t pick up upon until later   I like that  it s clever writing  Things gradually start to make sense as we read on and it changes to a total of three different points of view  This gives us different perspectives on the story It s very clever and as just as I worked out what was going on  there is a twist and a twist and probably another one  too  I lost count Certainly my best read off the year  Hats off to Paula Hawkins  EXCELLENT book   I just could not get enough of this story  It was very well written  a little on the repetitive side  but at the same time  given the nature of the main character and what she was dealing with  it was fitting  I was just blown away    I ve never heard of this author  I believe she is new but if all her upcoming books suck you in as this one does  I m sold   Loved it   Great Hard to follow at first  But loved it after that  If you loved Gone Girl  you ll love this book for sure  I devoured this book  In fact  I woke up at 3am second guessing my early theory and had to keep reading out of curiosity  Rachel  the main character  reminded me of Sasha from The Hypnotist Love Story by Liane Moriaty because both have similar profiles  However  the way this novel unravels is completely all its own  I loved the structure  We witness the story through several key characters  perspectives at different time points and not until nearly the end do we see it all come together  The characters are unapologetically and seriously flawed and yet they are everyday people  our spouses and neighbors  and that alone disturbs  Absolute stellar debut  Although I ll need to follow with a much lighter book  Something that shows the sunnier side of humanity  No book will actually be  the next Gone Girl   that s not a fair assessment  That said   This was a great book with unpleasant characters and kept me reading through the night   This book was described as  a gripping and enthralling psychological thriller   It lives up to the description  It was a page turner and an suspenseful mystery  It was much better than Gone Girl which I personally did not like  I read it almost right through and am missing it  Excellent novel by a new author  I understand why some people said they didn t like this book  I will say that the characters reminded me of some of Gillian Flynns characters  very unlikeable  but that s where the similarity stopped  I listened to this book on audio and read it using Amazons narration thingy  That s a big reason why the book immediately held my interest otherwise it probably would have taken me longer to finish  I won t give you a synopsis because plenty of other people have already done that  But    this book isn t for everyone  Some will love it while others hate it  It really is terribly depressing and there is no happy ending  Just reality  Wow  This was an exceptional read  I felt every emotion  dependency  pain   I felt everything  Hawkins  allowed the reader to espy the painful consequences of giving in to our weaknesses  The book was intense  and I not once wanted to put it down until I arrived at the last page of her book  The Girl On The Train  and when my vision became blurred and eyes crossed  I loved how she developed Rachel s imagination  In a way  the train daydreams reminded me of myself  I totally  anticipate reading more work from her  It s so much easier looking at someone and writing their life verses actual getting to know them  This is definitely  a bit more than a 5 star GoodRead in my opinion   Definitely a page turner with twists and turns  Gone girl ish for sure   When I saw this book in the first position of the USA Today Best seller books list and all the negative reviews about it in goodreads com or any other website and how people are comparing it to Gone Girl and listing all the similarities of the 2 books  I almost change my mind about reading it but I told myself I ll give it a shot and review it myself and believe me I did not and I m not regretting having read it All of the negative reviews didn t stop me of reading this book and actually it shouldn t stop anyone too Go ahead guys and read it and forget all about some some negative reviews because it s a really really good book and believe me you ll have fun reading it  I enjoyed this book  Easy to read  fast paced enough to keep me turning pages and not skim parts  which I tend to do if bored   and interesting story  I liked the flawed main character  well maybe not liked but understood her perhaps   I would definitely read more from this author  I don t know why it is so often compared to Gone Girl though  which I also enjoyed   I can t say this book was unputdownable   at times I had to put it down so I could catch my breath and get my head around what was happening  Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning  Every day she rattles down the track  flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes  and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck   Their life  as she sees it  is perfect  Not unlike the life she recently lost And then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough  Now everything s changed  It s hard to review this book without risking spoilers so I ll keep it brief The author s writing style is perfect for this kind of fast paced thriller  The first person narrative alternating between the main female characters made me feel like a mutual friend of each woman  Sure that they had my sympathy they were confiding in me  not realising that with a turn of the page I d switch allegiance For the first time in a while I found myself suspicious of almost every character involved in the main plot  so I can hardly take credit for guessing the  big reveal   I d recommend The Girl on the Train to lovers of psychological thrillers that don t pull any punches Thank you to the publisher for the advance reading copy  If you like reading a mystery triller this book is for you  the story will have you sitting on the edge of your seat  this story has three main characters Rachel Watson is the main

wife she got the husband  Tom  and the house and a beautiful baby  now she want one nuisance in her life to go away the ex wife Rachel Watson the mystery of the plot is very well and the suspicion moves around all the characters  At first i was quite confused  i was reading and familiarizing myself with one character  but then i found myself reading about two other people  I really enjoy reading this book i couldn t put it down because i wanted to know more  During the summer of 2013 Rachel rides the train into London everyday pretending to go to the job from which she had been fired and trying to hide her alcoholism from her landlady  She passes houses she recognizes  two in particular  and adopts fantasies about the lives of the people there  Melanie and Scott live in one of the

about her past and her involvement with the people she observes from the train and her struggle to sort out the meanings of the events that led to her present life  Fantastic  Read it in a day  will think about it for many days  No spoilers here  but  kept me guessing the whole time   This book reminded me of Gone Girl  not only for the great mystery  but also for the unlikeable characters  Rachel is divorced from her husband  She wanted to have a child  but in vitro did not work for them and slowly she became an alcoholic  Tom  a manipulator  husband tells her all the terrible things she does when drunk  He leaves  Rachel moves in with a friend  She doesn t want the friend to know she has been fired because she was drunk  so she leaves for the train every morning  Tom has married and has a daughter  Evie  Rachel continues to call and drive Tom and his wife crazy  On the train Rachel sees a couple in the house near where she used to live  She makes up stories about them and their happiness  Until one day  she sees the woman  Meg kissing another man  Meg disappears and her husband is accused of the murder  Rachel is sure he couldn t have done it  In between drinking  she tries to help him  I enjoyed this mystery and didn t figure it out until near the end  One thing I didn t agree with was Rachel s fear at the end of the book  Wow  This was excellent   read it slowly so you don t miss anything  I finished this book a week ago and I am still speechless  I was hooked and mystified and rattled and intrigued and perplexed and everything a good mystery book should make you feel   and that was only after chapter one  Sometimes  I tend to finish reading a book in less than a day  But  by the time I get to the end I skip couple of lines and get the gist of the paragraph or a page and skip a lot of narration  So  this time I decided to take my all time I need to read each and every line in the book  Coming to book now  I loved it  This is one of best thrillers I read till this day  I loved every single bit of the book  Though there was a small part where I didn t really enjoy the read  it was very negligible  I just cannon explain how enticing the book was  It was really hard for me to put the book down  It was worth every single minute of my time  I had quite fun reading it  I cannot praise it enough  I immensely admire Paula Hawkins for such an interesting and gripping read  Rachel was a typical weak girl you could find next door  The way she was entangled into the story seems so real  It was very believable  There was a point where  I was so irritated with her addiction  If she were my friend I would have shown her some tough love for sure  Megan was a little like Amy  from gone girl  I loved the way her character was built  She was that perfect little girl  every one would want to be but once they see into her life  it was everything they would hate to have  For me  she seemed very delusional  She also seemed very shattered  weak and strong at the same time  Anna  What can I tell about her  Do I love her  NO  Do I hate her  Maybe a little  Do I wish she didn t exist  NO  She was someone I would hate to see in real life  But in this story she was right where she should be and just how we would want her to be  Scott is a good guy  if you ask me  Having couple of weaknesses made his character feel very real  I would have loved to hear a tiny bit of story from Scott s point of view too  But  he was just the right person to exist as Megan s husband Tom    what can I speak about him  He was just perfect  Though I hated few facts about him I loved this character for following his heart  The ending would have been amazing  if there weren t so much drag  But I am happy with whatever was put together  I found every single missing detail answered and logical enough to fit in  All together  one if the best books I read in the recent past   Holy crap  Hit the halfway mark and could not put it down  The comparisons to Gone Girl are not fair  I hated Gone Girl  What a great ride  I could not put it down  Creepy  Rachel rides the commuter train to work each day and looks out at the homes as she rides along  Once upon a time  one of the homes was hers until her husband had an affair and left her  Now he and his new wife and baby daughter live there  One day Rachel sees something from the train window  Because Rachel is lonely  broke  and jealous of her ex husband s new life she ends up getting embroiled in a murder mystery connected with what she witnessed from the train window which is only several houses down to her former home  Be ready to want to read  just one more chapter  if you pick up this book  Great suspense novelI enjoyed it from beginning to end  Suspenseful from the beginning  no need to wait until the middle of the book  Rachel drinks because it lets her slide  warm and loose  into oblivion  I don t blame her Along the way  we find out just why she d rather choose oblivion than real life  Rachel is realistic   unreliable  fucked up  weak  She s just a girl on the train  until one day she s no longer just a girl on the train  going back and forth without point or purpose This book is intense  different and I loved every moment of it  The writing style is different but not that hard to follow  pay attention to the dates given   It s fast paced  3 so there no boring lulls  Each word in each line has a reason  For example  Rachel compares herself with Sylvia Plath and Assia  I want to ring Anna up and remind her that Assia ended up with her head in the oven  just like Sylvia did  I MEAN LIKE  IS THIS FORESHADOWING OR SOMETHING  The description of an alcohol is as well as the gas lighting felt so real to the point where it annoyed meI totally get the hype and am looking forward for more from the author  Great read for a 1st timer  Looking forward to more    Excelente  Uma trama complexa  personagens com caracteristicas peculiares e a presenca do trem suburbano  Narrativa atemporal e por 3 diferentes personagens  E preciso estar atento a cronologia de cada uma delas e quem sabe ao terminar  reler os primeiros capitulos  Fazia tempo que nao lia um bom suspense  Ele termina mas a historia fica com voce  O mais gostoso foi terminar este livro dentro de um trem Recomendado    A great thriller  I didn t want to put it down  A friend described it as  reading popcorn   I like that   not a whole lot of substance  but once you start you can t stop  And who doesn t love popcorn  The plot combines elements of Rear Window  Vertigo  Gaslight and Psycho  It s a shame Hitchcock isn t still around to direct the movie  But I hear a really good team is being assembled to make the movie  so I have high hopes   This was my first audio book and such a good choice   This story kept me hooked and wanting to listen to more   OMG  the last 100 pages of this book were so intense  I couldn t stop reading  I just had to finish this today  IT WAS AMAZING  So intense  so unpredictable  the writing was amazing and the characters were complex and messed up but that is what made me love them more    And I was not expecting that character to be the killer AT ALL   Loved it loved it loved it     Intense and very well done  Once I read Psychological Thriller Novel and it was awesome  Dari paragraf awal sampai akhir  novel ini menjanjikan perjalanan yang tak membosankan  Melaju dengan alur yang sempurna  tidak begitu lambat akan tetapi tidak terlalu cepat  penulis dengan lihai mengungkap setiap fakta dengan begitu mencekam Saya juga sangat menyukai tiga sudut pandang dalam novel ini  Rachel  Megan  dan Anna  Ketiganya begitu realistis  dan alasan dibalik setiap perbuatan mereka bertiga sangat rasional  Saya terutama suka bagaimana masa lalu ketiga tokoh tersebut tidak hanya diceritakan sebagai filler akan tetapi sebagai fondasi yang sangat kokoh bagi kelangsungan cerita The movie adaptation of this novel starring Emily Blunt and Jared Leto will hit the cinemas on October 2017  Can t wait  Wow  What a story  Dark  suspenseful  and thrilling    When reading late at night  I actually felt frightened at times  It was a great book  and I m looking forward to the movie version  I can only hope that it is as good as the book  There is so much going on in this story and trying to keep the info straight between each of the female characters perspectives was challenging at times  I think that if I would have had the time to read it in one sitting  it would have been easier to comprehend all of the events taking place  Although it was difficult to put down  I read this over the course of a few days  I had to re read parts to make sure that I knew where I left off with a particular character s narration  Rachel  Megan  and Anne  so that I could have a better understanding of the story and to eliminate any confusion  That s not a negative   just a warning   be prepared that this book is full of lots of descriptive details given by the three narrators  I enjoyed reading each females  perspective and found this to be a very creative story  I look forward to reading more books by Paula Hawkins  Amazing author  I m one of the slowest readers on the planet and the fact that I read this book in 24 hours speaks volumes    at least for me  anyway  I just couldn t put it down  It s that good  Yeah  it s dark and I didn t much care for the characters  however I grew to adore Rachel     it was still damn good  What an awesome  suspenseful plot    great twists  I really didn t see it coming until right before it all came crashing in  It was an edge of your seat read     I just wished I could have savored it a little longer  Highly recommend this book   Loved it  Great thriller  Had me guessing until the end   Full of surprises  love the writing style  a great book to start the year with    Such a great book to read  I sympathize with the heroine struggling to get people to listen to her when they know she s crazy  Great twists and turns in the plot  This book really kept me turning the pages  and that s what I ask for when reading for pleasure  There were some parts that were a bit difficult to believe  but that s true in most fictional stories  A fun and exciting read  with suspense akin to Gone Girl  a great read  fast paced  a real page turner  This book was like a drug  I couldn t put it down  It was addicting  suspenseful and just down right clever  I feel like lots of people also compare this to  Gone Girl  but there also two very different books and Girl on the Train has its own kind in suspense and thrill  I loved how Jenkins perfected the perspective of all 3 characters it just really tied the bow for me  The thing is everyone is a really horrible person in this book  they all do something scandalous or commit some kind of negative act which is very intelligently composed  On top of that its just down right twisted and this factor just creatives such a damn cool perspective  This has been one of the best reads I ve had in a while  and I would recommend it to anyone no matter what your preference in genres is cause it has a bit of everything   WOW   This was riveting  I almost felt like a voyeur at times  Totally mesmerizing  engrossing  you name it  Recommended  Powerful  compelling  psychological thriller along the lines of Gone Girl  Word of warning   you will not want to put this one down  so block out a day or so to devour it  Yes  it s just that kind of book  Yes  it is worthy of the hype  I m expecting a film out of this one  too  Highly recommended  I read this whole book in two days  ironically  on a train  This book grabs you and doesn t let go  It s a lovely little ride of twists and turns    We know from page 1 that a female has been killed  we don t find out who it is until about 50  through the book and don t have a clue who did it until   80  completed  What a keep you guessing  edge of your seat story   We have three narrators RACHEL  the main narrator  divorced  unemployed  alcoholic  whose excessive drinking causes her to have blackouts   and she has no memories of these black periods  She has totally lost control of her life and is miserable  and is still in love with her ex husband  But every day  she  pretends  to go to work in London  taking the train  and as the train passes this one house  she sees this couple whom she imagines to be the  perfect  couple  Megan and Scott  However  she later sees Megan in the garden kissing another man  not so perfect after all  Rachel needs to be somebody  needs to feel worthwhile but does so in such inappropriate  damaging ways  She is trying hard to redeem herself MEGAN  the beautiful wife of the perfect couple who has a checkered past and many dark secrets hidden even from her husband Scott  Megan needs to have sexual control over men  with her  it s a game   and she doesn t like to lose  Unfortunately  her past comes back to haunt her in an unexpected way ANNA  Rachel s ex husband Tom s new wife  w  whom he had an affair while married to Rachel  later married Anna  and they have a child  Anna needs Rachel  whom she sees as dangerous  unstable  and frightening  to leave her  her husband and their daughter alone  But  maybe all is not as it seems in her household  Finally at  80  of the book  the killer is discovered for what he REALLY is  by Rachel  and     I did NOT have a clue  A MUST read  for sure      One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl    Three for a girl  I m stuck on three  I just can t get any further  My head is thick with sounds  my mouth thick with blood  Three for a girl  I can hear the magpies  they are laughing  mocking me  a raucous cackling  A tiding  Bad tidings  I can see them now  black against the sun  Not the birds  something else  Someone s coming  Someone is speaking to me  Now look  Now look what what you made me do  Oke jadi itu kutipan pertama dari novel ini  I got so confused because I was actually understood it  Tapi entahlah ini jadi my favorite quote on this book  So strange but has a deep meaning  ternyata this is all about Megan  She died with her baby  her body discovered with a broken bone  Sad  Pelakunya orang terdekat dari tokoh utama ini  sungguh gak dipercaya  Awalnya I thought the murdered were Kamal or Scott  tapi no  ah sial bener bener dipermainkan istingku disini  haha  I really love this book  ini pertama kalinya aku baca buku Thriller  this book blowing my mind banget dan this book has changed my perception about life  Really can t wait for the movie   I loved loved loved it    It gave me the thrill of Gone Girl maybe more amazing book great plot i was on the edge of my seat the whole time    Unexpected events i just love it    I really enjoyed this book  it has a slow  meandering way of folding you into a story which seems so innocent and light to start with but gradually descends into complex darkness  The characters are wonderfully crafted  and all of them are not what they appear to be  Loved the first person narrative and the way it switches perspective  I like that I cant say a lot on the plot lest some of the best bits be given away    But if you enjoy a thrill  a mystery or several scares  wrapped up with what I felt was a true understanding of the fragility of people and the nature of abuse  in many forms you ll enjoy this  Its a complex  intelligent thriller where no character is left as a 2D image  but all are given a life  soul  and a brokenness I found realistic  rich and compelling  Best thriller I have read since Night Film  I had my suspicions about who the killer was early on but it did not diminish my enjoyment or slow my pace  I wanted to spend every spare minute of the past three days with this book  Certainly not an uplifting book but the ending does not make you angry the way Gone Girl does  I really want this to be a movie  such a great vehicle for three actresses  Really great book  Similar style to  Gone Girl   the book is told from the vantage point of the 3 women protagonists  The last 20  of the book is highly suspenseful  and I look forward to the movie version   If you liked Gone Girl  you will love this book  I Couldn t put it down  which for me hasn t happened in a long time   Kept me at the edge of my seat until the end  Highly recommend   Amazing  The best book I ve read in a long time  Maybe even better than Gone Girl  I love that there are three strong female characters in this book and so Hollywood has no choice but to embrace that in their upcoming film version  The film version star Emily Blunt as Rachel and is set in New York  I can really see Emily in the role and look forward to her depicting Rachel s alcoholism and how a couple of strangers ultimately save her from descending into total oblivion  I m very  very excited to find out who will pay the rest of the cast   Beware before ride this train   A power packed suspense thriller  you cannot get down once you board this train Amazing story line   gripping narration will not allow you to put down this book once you start off A must read for every fiction lover  I figured out the ending about 3 4 of the way through  which maybe is later than most people would  I m not sure  But I found this book endlessly fascinating  Three fairly unreliable narrators  all women  all very different  I didn t particularly LIKE any of them  but I still enjoyed reading things from their perspective  Definitely check this out   Also  the comparisons to Gone Girl are pretty ridiculous  It s really nothing like Gone Girl   Sten arkhe moiazei me gunaikoulistiko muthistorema  upotheto   Aute pou den ekane paidia kai autos pou ten paratese gia mia alle kai emeine sto spiti

actually each of them has been in my mind the one who did it at certain time in the book  Any one could have done it      Of course the main character with its alcoholism was not always likeable  but the author had to blur the story somehow and seems like she described the alcoholic very well Highly recommended suspense page turner  My friends and I chose this book for our book club  It was fantastic  I read the book in a day  I couldn t put it down  Just when I thought I had the entire story figured out  something else happened that completely changed my mind  My heart was racing as I read each chapter  Thoroughly enjoyed every page This book was disturbing yet I couldn t put it down  lots of flawed characters with many twists and turns  A bit unbelievable but glad I read it since it has been on the best seller list for so long  I think it would make a great movie  Was the first book I listened to on audio tape  Thought the plot was great  good pacing  nice twist  I would read it again  La chica del tren es una novela de intriga y misterio que se ha convertido en un Best seller mundial  y de la que se han vendido cinco millones de ejemplares en seis meses  permaneciendo 20 semanas en la lista de los libros mas vendidos del New York Times  considerandola asi la novela para adultos mas rapidamente vendida en la historia  Ganadora a mejor libro de misterio en el 2015 en GoodReads y en multiples publicaciones  La adaptacion cinematografica esta programada para otono de este ano  en la cual los protagonistas seran Emily Blunt y Luke Evans  tenia muchas ganas de leer un buen libro  y ahora comprendo por que esta historia tuvo tanto revuelo    Es simplemente insolita para mi  normalmente este no es mi genero mas sin embargo me mantuvo cautivada desde un inicio  Rachel toma el tren todas las mananas y desde el puede ver hacia unas casas q estan cerca de las vias  la  23 su antigua casa y la  15 la de Jess y Jason  una pareja q le recuerda a diario lo q ella ya no tiene  Sumida en un profunda depresion a causa de su divorcio  Rachel abusa del alcohol al grado de olvidar lo q hizo la noche anterior  pero cuando recuperar su memoria puede resultar ser de vida o muerte  ella no parara hasta lograrlo  Hay veces que me caen tan mal los personajes  Rachel me cayo muy mal a veces  otras me dio lastima  otras estuve completamente de su lado y senti su rabia  y otras simplemente no la entendia  y es que este un personaje tan complejo  y no me refiero a complicado  sino a lo elaborado q esta  podria haber estado narrando la escritora algo q a ella le paso ya q describe el alcoholismo de Rachel como si fuera algo propio  es de verdad impresionante  Un thriller q te mantendra con el libro pegado a las manos  tentada a adelantarte unas paginas por q no tienes ni idea del posible final  Se gano cada estrella   4 5 stars because the end was a bit disappointing I couldn t put this book down  It grabbed my attention from the start and is the most refreshing crime novel I ve read in a while  especially in terms of the main character  Really clever idea with the train and Rachel s flaws  Enjoyed it thoroughly and highly recommend it  The only reason I read this book was because I had a free point from audible  So I  purchased  The audiobook  Are usually listen to this book on my way to work and on my way home and I have been loving it  Following the different dates was a little tricky at first but I began to get a hang of the different timelines between the narrators I love how dark and mysterious this book was mainly follow Rachel s point of view but we also hear from Anna and Megan  What I loved about this book was how I had no idea how it was going to end  and who was the killer  It was dark  disturbing and very thrilling to read which was surprising because I had read many mixed reviews about this book mainly good but some bad  I would definitely recommend this book to people who like dark novels   I loved this book      Paula Hawkins  storytelling here is fantastic and I enjoyed every second of this book  If you like unreliable narrators with a penchant for lying to you  the reader   then you ll love this adventure that has a satisfying ending  HIGHLY recommended  Smraziavashcho originalen tril r  Avtorkata izkliuchitelno fino e narisuvala tezi mrachni otriaz tsi  razgledani obstoino prez pogleda na tri gledni

it  I wanted to read it again and again  I m obsessed with it  This is a real thriller  it s so addictive in the end  I couldn t stop reading it  Everything about the story is so architecturally built and it s defininately a book that keeps you guessing and makes you be alert and suspicious of everyone involved  There are secrets  lies  infidelity and so much mystery  it never gets boring  The characters are great and it s one of a few books I can say that the characters are well built  there is a great psychological depth in this book  It s officially one of my favourite books now  the best thriller I have ever read   4 5    couldn t put it down  Paula Hawkins creates a psychologically thrilling mystery through the alternating viewpoints of alcoholic Rachel  mentally unstable Megan  and home wrecker Anna  Each of the three women s lives intersect with each other  resulting in a complex murder mystery in which each woman finds themselves entangled somehow Hawkins has a real talent for her beautiful descriptions of mundane tasks  Even an action as simple as Rachel taking a sip of alcohol  or Anna holding her baby Evie  or a description of Megan s appearance  feels magical and meaningful  Hawkins chooses her words and their placement very carefully  ensuring to leave nothing out  Each detail means something and cannot be discounted Additionally  her characters develop realistically  changing in subtle ways over a believable amount of time  Although the final chapters do feel a bit rushed  the story wraps up neatly  leaving the reader satisfied with the outcome  Although the outcome is unexpected  once again  it feels very believable  Hawkins mixes mystery  the struggles that accompany addiction  and the complexities of love and romance effortlessly throughout the 330 pages of  The Girl on the Train   I could not put this book down  I became an expert in doing things with one hand so I could hold the book in the other hand   read while blow drying my hair  fixing lunch for my kids  brushing my teeth   I feel bad for my family  they didn t see much of me these past 2 days I picked up the book under the recommendation of  if you liked Gone Girl you will like The Girl on the Train  but this was way better than Gone Girl  Seriously  It s not a warm fuzzy feel good but if you are looking for a suspenseful page turner this is the book for you  Twists and turnsTwists and turns  You should expect that from a psychological thriller  And that s exactly what you get  There are a couple of plot elements that are a little repetitive but all in all it was an interesting  dark journey    this was really the most hyped book of 2015 it was everywhere and doubtless will be MADE INTO A BLOCKBUsting film even for people who have not read the book and it will be a runaway success   I must admit i enjoyed the book especially the begining and the same boring commute each day and how we all make stories of the people in the houses we pass or the people we see each day     Rachel is the main character on the train and sees things she should nt going on between characters and is strung into a situation she cant get out of   i know a few people who have read this and most enjoy it but a few not impressed   i am not good at following murder  mystery things so i enjoyed a few people claim to basic  I showed my mum the first chapter and she said had read it before but MAybe confused it with gone girl  not to sure on this  I suppose the main thing u should remember is not to judge on first impressions      oh wonder how many people were annoyed by the comments oh u r a girl reading the girl on a train   huh sigh  WOW   What an Awesome Awesome Read    Some compared it to  Gone Girl  but this was way BETTER    Could NOT put it down    This one features a bunch of horrible  messed up  depressing characters with lots of secrets  going about making bad decisions  and living shitty lives  Absolutely nothing redeeming about the characters  This is why some will hate this book  But I have learned to separate despicable characters from an engaging story  and appreciate the story for what it is _engagin  Like watching a train wreck unable to keep ones eyes of it  I was hooked from the beginning to the end  What makes for a great book  It s characters  The story  How well written  What you learn  How well you are entertained  This book grabbed my attention so much so that I found myself skipping meals just cause I don t want to stop reading to cook and feed myself  That said its getting a 5 star from me  I wanted to be entertained and I was  To anyone wondering if they should read this book  READ IT NOW READ IT RIGHT NOW BUY IT AND READ IT IN ONE SITTING  I almost did  I started one hot evening and finished it the next day around lunch time  only taking a break to sleep  You know how Stephen King has that way of writing that s not necessarily poetic or ultra quotable  but so INTERESTING that you never feel bored  Paula Hawkins writes like that  She doesn t add any filler or bad metaphors  it s all just story story story and it s extremely addicting The question I m about to propose is for those who have already read it and it is NOT SPOILER FREE Did anyone else see the weird parallels between Megan and Rachel  One was barren and the other lost her child  one was being cheated on and the other was cheating  etc etc   I thought there was going to be something there  like we find out at the end that they re the same woman  or that Megan was completely made up and was just some sort of sick wish fulfillment  I don t know  maybe I m over analyzing Anyway  this is one I need to buy for myself so I can reread it every summer  Literally  my only complaint was on the editor s part because there were some typos and weird sentences  I LOVE THIS BOOK  5 stars  You know it s a good book when you can t stop thinking about it when you put it down and can t wait to pick it up again  This is one of those book  Have sat solidly for the last three hours to finish it   something I haven t felt the need to do for a while  Basically it tells the story of three women  Rachel who travels the train every day  the women she sees from the train window sat on her patio every day  and the third the women Rachel s husband had an affair with  One day Rachel sees something from the train that changes everything     Crazy good   Absolutely insane and intense   I literally read the entire book in 9 hours  I couldn t put it down  If you are into romance  mystery  or thriller stories  this one is definitely a good one  I honestly didn t see it coming   I didn t think I was going to enjoy this book after I d read the first chapter and I stopped reading for a couple of weeks but then I went back to it and started reading again and became totally engrossed in it within a few minutes  Rachel travels on the same trains every day and creates an imaginary life for a couple she sees in their house and garden  She calls them Jess and Jason and she thinks they are happy together Then she see something which upsets all her pre conceived ideas and it really unsettles her  It is clear to the reader that Rachel has a problem with drinking and is never completely sober and it gradually emerges that her life is not at all what it seems to be at first When the young woman she has called Jess goes missing  Rachel is obsessed with following the news story and it starts to change her life  We hear from Megan  Jess  and Anna who is now married to Rachel s ex husband and the story is told by these three woman in turn  What is the truth  What really happened on the night Megan disappeared  Who is telling the truth and who is lying  Are they all lying I found this book totally compulsive reading after not being able to get into it over the first few pages  I wanted to know what the truth was and I wanted to know about these three women and how they are really connected  I felt sorry for and annoyed with Rachel by turns  I wanted to tell her to get help and sort herself and her life out and her friend Cathy  with whom she lodges  seems to have the same reactions to her This is a well written novel and I shall definitely be watching out for more books by this author  I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley for review purposes  I wasn t sure what to expect from this book  The premise wasn t something that drew me  but the fact that so many of my friends recommended it made me curious Immediately I was struck by the similarities to Gillian Flynn s novels  mostly in the writing style and the use of mysterious and unreliable narrators   Not at all surprised to come here and see other reviewers are making the same comparisons The storytelling in the novel was tight  Hawkins tells the story at the right pace  in the right order  revealing different timelines in tandem in a way that unfolds the story wonderfully  I figured out the  twist  about halfway through  but only because of her use of misdirection on every character EXCEPT the killer  I wouldn t say it was predictable  though  and right up until the end I still thought things could shift another direction  Everything feels possible My one beef with this story was  and this is also keeping in tune with Flynn   that every character was unlikable  to the point of being grating  I love a good antagonist or antihero  I love divisive characters  But Rachel s tics and issues became tedious and grating by the end of the book  Megan was an interesting character who warranted further time and explanation because  I suspect  she d have been incredibly more dynamic than her limited narrative allowed and perhaps more sympathetic as a result  Anna wasn t given enough page time to separate what appeared to be her sociopathic tendencies vs  her love for her child  And the men suffered from similar treatment  Like in any Flynn book  you walk away feeling as if there is no clear winner That said  this book kept me up all night reading  which is rare for me nowadays  so I can t say the challenges above had a significant impact on my enjoyment  The Girl on the Train is a tightly woven  excellently paced thriller that I d recommend to readers who love a great suspenseful read  The Girl On The Train was a doozy of a read  Simply a great thriller  This novel kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish  Our main character Rachel travel in and out of London daily  She sees that same people everyday and thinks she knows them as well  One day however  on her daily journey she sees something different  and a bit out of the ordinary  Not knowing exactly what to do  or how to handle the situation she decides to take take action  Her actions thrust her into a chain of events that she may not recover from  A rapid fire suspense thriller  Hawkins tells the story through three female perspectives  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  As the story unravels it takes many twists and turns and the truth is both surprising and mind blowing  Hawkins does a great job building the action and suspense to the final pages and nails it with a superb novel   To pass time on her daily commute by train  Rachel looks out the window at the homes along the tracks and becomes attached to the imagined lives of a young couple she calls  Jess and Jason   A perfect fantasy until she discovers the wife has gone missing and her imagination turned fixation gets the better of her  The overwhelming amount of rave reviews this book is getting just weeks after its publication date does not surprise me  Hawkins  debut is chilling till the very end  Every page of The Girl on the Train is unpredictable  every character  including the three women who narrator the story  is riddled with issues  It s a tense  emotional read and the less you know about the plot before you pick it up the more entertained you ll be  A literal page turner  5 5 stars   I started reading this book and felt disgusted by the main character  Rachel  So miserable  pathetic   But the sympathy for her builds up quickly   Until she drinks again   I was on that roller coaster with her throughout the book  I think author has done a great job describing the state of an alcoholic    It s ugly and scary The mystery becomes riveting pretty quickly and it gets intense   I couldn t stop reading   Such a mess in all those lives  you start doubting your own   The ending is rather disappointing but I couldn t suggest a better ending   I don t know the best way to end that story    And 290 pages of a great developing story beats the last 25 of the weak ending  I am very impressed by this book  thank you to Paula Hawkins  superba    buy it Amazing    A must read  suspenseful and exciting  Highly recommend it to all  Read it in just over 24 hours  I didn t want it to end  Normally I do not make an effort to read current best sellers  but I am glad I did this time  Even though I did not like any of the characters at all  I wanted to know more about each one  especially Rachel  A mark of a good writer is the ability to make thoroughly unlikable characters likable   For the first time I did not even bother to check what was the last page number or how many pages were there yet to be read   I loved it to the core   totally   My favourite line   what is that gap between dreaming and wakefulness I really enjoyed this book  A great mystery  It s easy to draw parallels between Paula Hawkin s _The Girl on the Train_ and Gillian Flynn s _Gone Girl_  Besides the similarities in title  they both feature complex  psychotic characters  and unreliable narrators  propelled by a quick moving plot  Both novels are also an investigation into the idea that appearances mean nothing and that carefully crafted facades can come crashing down with the simplest of interventions  One place where _The Girl on the Train_ easily bests _Gone Girl_  however  is in its logical   yet still shocking and satisfying   ending  Too many otherwise great thrillers climax far before the ending and fall into an unimpressive heap in the final pages  Luckily  this is not the case with _Train_ Comparisons aside  I think we can all relate to the fantasy of  outside looking in   inventing stories about those we encounter during the course of our daily lives  Hawkins takes this concept many steps further and introduces us to Rachel  an alcoholic who has entirely too much history with a certain street in a London suburb  where she observes a couple  she even gives them names  Jess   Jason  from her morning train to a job she no longer has  Her interactions with the characters and the turmoil she faces within herself  to drink  or not to drink  With Rachel  the answer is almost always to drink    plus our uncertainty of whether or not we can believe what she says  definitely keep this novel interesting  As readers  we get alternating viewpoints every other chapter that lend insight to the house of cards that comes crashing down in the last 20  I am eager to devour Hawkin s next book  It s not often I stay up until way past my bedtime to finish a book  Good work  Ms  Hawkins  This was way different than anything I have read in a long time  And I couldn t stop  I was fascinated with how fucked up yet real everyone was  The audiobook narration was EXCELLENT  There were three separate narrators for the 3 POVs which was super helpful  Anna s voice I didn t love but her part was very small  Rachel and Megan s voices were lovely  The British accents were so nice  Loved it  Many people compare it to Gone Girl  They shouldn t  Yes  it is a whodunnit and there are love hate interests but that is where the similarities end  I think it is very well written  quickly engrossing and moves faster than Gone Girl  A really great  fun book  Hawkins book gets rave reviews  There is a definite reason for the praise  The Girl on the Train is a mystery that keeps you guessing  Megan  Rachel and Anna are all victims  They are humans with flaws and foibles with at least one thing in common  A highly recommended read   A deeply unsympathetic central character might sound off putting  but Rachel is so human it still draws you in  The archetypal unreliable narrator  she even knows she is unreliable  The use of more than one narrator and time frame also highlights how important it is to see more than just one side of any story  Great story  constant twists and turns  Dark and twistyI enjoyed this one  I like the way Flynn writes her books  from different character perspectives  Didn t see the end coming either  Best book of the year  Great characters  great plot  just GREAT  I held out on reading this book for a very long time  It is very suspenseful and dark but I couldn t but it down  The challenge solving the mystery will keep you reading   The book starts with a narration of the girl on the train  She tells us about some things that are happening now and others that happened in the past  Then another narrator chimes in  Then another  And slowly the whole puzzle comes together  and we see how things were interconnected  I loved the pace of the story telling  and overall the book was very engaging   This book took a little while for me to get into  however the velocity really swept me up once I was about a fourth of the way into it  A new writer  Paula Hawkins does an incredible job of weaving disparate points of view into a truly thrilling and gripping story  Not the same old warm oatmeal  she is an extremely refreshing writer  There is a reason this is the  1 best seller right now  Pick it up  you won t be able to put it down I couldn t put it down  I had to know   This book is a hell of a ride  On a train  Just kidding    but seriously  this book is a heck of thriller  I honestly haven t enjoyed a book in this genre this much since    wait for it    Gone Girl  I know that s such a cliche   There are so many twists and turns  characters you feel sorry for  then immediately hate  but then truly love all in a matter of pages  It s a very dark book and while the ending is well written  it s predictable  I guessed it with about 75 pages left  to contrast with Gone Girl as I was shocked to the very last page   But it s definitely a 5 star in my book and highly recommend   Whew  I read this book in a day and a half  It was incredible  It s now 2am and I will not be able to sleep for a good while after finishing this  I am pleasantly terrified  I love books like this  I just love how fast paced and mysterious it was and I also just love an unreliable narrator  Highly recommend to someone who wants a fast read or someone who just loves suspense   The trouble with idle imagination is that it gets you deeply into situations when you have only a small understanding or even a BIG MISUNDERSTANDING of what is really going on  This situation gets even more complicated when the misunderstandings are multiplied by three different narrators  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  each with her own assumptions and misunderstandings about the other two  And when one is an alcoholic  not recovering  unfortunately   and the other two are seductresses caught in love triangles with one another s husbands  friends  and therapists  then it gets really complicated trying to figure out what s real and what was only imagined or misunderstood  That this entire narration is so interesting  really so captivating  is to the credit of author Hawkins  considerable skills  Not a comic  but a tragic tale  and well worth the time  Super fun straight up thriller  Rachel is the best drawn of the characters  most are pretty flat  and Hawkins does a great job of creating a person who feels so real  so flawed  If you like your fiction fast paced and plot driven  this is your book  I went in a little leery because of all of the hype and then because of the backlash against the hype but I read this in a few short bursts over 24 hours  It was hard to put down  It isn t the next Gone Girl  and in fact  didn t really remind me at all of GG  I guess anything that is dark and disturbing is going to be called the next GG  Pick it up and decide for yourself but in my opinion  this one is worthy of the hype   And will make a great movie    HET MEISJE IN DE TREIN   PAULA HAWKINSDe cover is zonder meer schitterend  De letters van de titel zijn op een aparte en originele manier weergegeven op een zwarte ondergrond  als een voorbijrazende trein  Onder de letters zelf zie je de voorbij rijdende trein  De letters zijn wit en het lijkt net alsof ze met de trein meerijden  De ondertitel is in een standard lettertype weergegeven  ook in wit  JE KENT HAAR NIET MAAR ZE WEET PRECIES WIE JIJ BENT Onderaan de cover staat de naam van de schrijfster  in okergeel  Ik geef de cover een dikke 9 Voordat het daadwerkelijke verhaal begint zijn er 2 pagina s met op elke pagina een kort stukje  Ze zijn beide zeer spannend geschreven en het smaakt direct naar meer  De spanning loopt op door deze 2 stukjes en maakt je nieuwsgierig naar de rest van het boek Het verhaal  Rachel neemt elke dag de trein van Ashbury naar London en  s avonds weer terug voor haar werk  Elke dag komt ze langs het huis in Witney waar ze met haar ex man Tom heeft gewoond  Die relatie is 2 jaar eerder door haar man verbroken  Rachel was door emotionele problemen aan de drank geraakt en haar man kon het niet meer aan  Hij bleek ondertussen al een tijd een minnares te hebben  Inmiddels is hij met haar  Anna  getrouwd en heeft een gezinnetje gesticht  Dit kan Rachel maar moeilijk verkroppen  Het voelt nog steeds als haar huis en als haar man  Op momenten dat Rachel stomdronken is  belt ze ook met regelmaat naar haar ex en dat verontrust Toms nieuwe echtgenote Anna erg  Enkele huizen verderop  in dezelfde straat  woont een stel dat zij als idealistisch en perfect beschouwd  een beetje zoals haar leven met Tom vroeger was  Ze noemt het stel Jess en Jason  Rachel kijkt ook elke dag op heen  en terugreis naar hun huis en fantaseert over het prachtige leven dat dit stel zou kunnen hebben Op een dag ziet ze iets vreemds in de tuin  Het zit Rachel niet lekker en ze gaat op een avond naar Witney om achter antwoorden te komen  De volgende dag wordt Rachel wakker met een black out  Waarschijnlijk door haar overmatige drankgebruik  Als later blijkt dat Jess sinds die avond vermist is  stapt Rachel naar de politie  Ze trekken haar tip na over wat ze eerder die week overdag gezien heeft in de tuin van Jess  maar de politie kan uiteindelijk niks met deze tip  Rachel wordt vanaf dat moment beschouwd als een onbetrouwbare getuige  aan de drank en mogelijk geestelijk instabiel Rachel gaat zelf op onderzoek uit naar wat er die bewuste die bewuste zaterdagavond gebeurd kan zijn Conclusie mening  Het boek bestaat uit meerdere verhalen met verschillende tijdlijnen  Ten eerste het verhaal van Rachel  dat begint op Vrijdag 5 juli 2013  Verder is er het verhaal van Megan  Rachel noemt haar Jess   Dit verhaal begint een jaar eerder op woensdag 16 mei 2012 Elk hoofdstuk  beginnend met een datum  bestaat uit de onderdelen  ochtend  en  avond   Heel af en toe zit er een deel  middag  bij De twee tijdlijnen en de levens van beide karakters komen langzamerhand bij elkaar  Deze manier van vertellen is heel bijzonder  de schrijfster bouwt zo heel knap de spanning op  Op zaterdag 20 juli 2013 komen de tijdlijnen van Rachel en Megan samen en komt er een nieuw verhaallijn bij  Anna  de huidige vrouw van Tom  Ook bij haar dezelfde indeling   ochtend  en  avond  en af en toe  middag   Zaterdag 20 juli 2013 is de datum dat Jess Megan verdwijnt  Megans verhaallijn blijft hierna in het verleden doorlopen  Die van Rachel en Anna lopen nu gelijk qua tijd Het verhaal zit als een perfecte puzzel in elkaar  Alle kleine details blijken achteraf van belang te zijn en het geheel valt uiteindelijk aan het eind perfect in elkaar  Je wordt meerdere keren tijdens het lezen op het verkeerde been gezet  Elke keer als je denkt dat je weet hoe het in elkaar steekt  volgt er een nieuwe verrassing  Het boek is goed geschreven  gedetailleerd  spannend  Elke keer blijken situaties in het boek anders in elkaar te zitten dan je daarvoor dacht  Heel knap gedaan Uiteindelijk komen de verhaallijnen dus samen en de schrijfster heeft geen steek laten vallen  Het verhaal is uitstekend opgezet Een klein minpuntje  de ondertitel klopt niet voor 100  als je het boek uit hebt  Rachel weet niet precies wie  JIJ  bent  Ze fantaseert bijvoorbeeld over Jess  die dus Megan blijkt te zijn  De ondertitel is wel begrijpelijk omdat ze het op deze manier net iets spannender maken  Het stoort dan ook absoluut niet voor het leesplezier en ik geef het prachtige debuut dan ook met veel plezier 5 sterren   Loved it  psychological thriller that turned my assumptions upside down  Acabo de terminarlo o o  Dios  que buen libro que fue este  La verdad que al principio no habia sentido gran emocion  pero como todo fue desarrollandose hacia el final fue excelente  Tenia dudas de todos  queria leer capitulo tras capitulo y la ultima parte    asombrosa  Realmente uno de los mejores policiales que lei estos ultimos dias   I liked this book more than Gone Girl  I wouldn t have predicted the ending  Couldn t put it down  Awesome book  kept me hooked right to the end  Couldn t put it down Intriguing  suspenseful  thrilling  and deeply captivating  this is a book you won t be able to put down  Reminiscent of Gone Girl but great in its own right  I d highly recommend this  if not for the story  then for the complexity of its leading character  AAlthough I had only read this a few months ago when it was selected by one of my reading groups I elected to re read  I felt it held up very well for a second reading though I still felt exasperated by Rachel s drinking It was well received by the group though we all agreed that all the main characters were hard to like much  We ended up talking about our own experiences of drinking to excess   in our younger wilder days and wondering whether the degree of drinking Rachel was doing was realistic in terms of the effects  It was a fun discussion and certainly collectively we agreed the novel deserved the popularity it had gained since publication   Great thriller with a great plot twist that I did not see coming  I loved this book  Excellent twist  didn t see it coming  Loved this book  There is much buzz in the book and it was well worth it  Usually in some suspense books  the who  what  why is hinted at but you never know until close to the end  Authors handle this differently    either memory loss or someone not being up front  What was unique about this story was the protagonist is an alcoholic and it is during a blackout when the mystery takes place  So she is trying to figure out what happened during her blackout  It is much more than that  It is an interesting character study on an alcoholic who is a depression since her husband left her and having other life problems  It is also the story of the 2 of the other woman in the book  the new wife as well as the missing woman who lives near the protagonists ex  I would say those looking for something a little different and in the mystery suspense genre  you would not be disappointed  Well maybe you will but I liked it    Want to know what I thought of this book  Read my review at http   www assistantplus com the girl     Unpredictable  Saya rekomendasikan untuk yang suka romance thriller  Cara Hawkins membuka fakta di buku ini keren banget  Bahkan saya sendiri ga nyangka ending ceritanya seperti itu Awal mula yang sederhana  kemudian kita dibawa ke dalam kesemrawutan konflik semua tokoh  sampai menjumpai akhir yang tak terduga  Lumayan mengaduk emosi Semua tokoh menyebalkan  Wkwk   aduh maaf ya  Tapi memang begitulah kenyataannya  Ga ada satupun tokoh di buku ini yang patut dijadikan contoh  sekalipun tokoh utamanya  Mungkin gara gara itu mengaduk emosi saya  pBuku ini diceritakan dengan 3 POV   Rachel  Anna  dan Megan  Penyampaian dengan 3 POV ini tidak membingungkan  karena dipisahkan dengan label nama dan tanggal  Walaupun saya sempet bolak balik juga lihat tanggalnya  D But It s not a big deal  Ga bakal mengurangi bintang yang saya kasih ke buku ini  5 stars  Thank you  Paula   Zuerst einmal zum Cover und dem Titel  Beides passt wie die Faust aufs Auge  Finde ich super gewahlt  Mehr ist dazu auch nicht zu sagen Dann mochte ich dieses Mal unbedingt zu den ersten Satzen des Buches ein paar Worte verlieren bzw  abschreiben  Schon nachdem ich sie gelesen hatte wusste ich  dass ich dieses Buch lieben werde und deshalb sind sie heute so wichtig  Vielen gefallt der beschreibende protokollartige Stil nicht auf Anhieb und sie mussen sich erst hineinfinden  Fur mich war es Liebe auf den ersten Blick Da liegt ein Kleiderhaufen an den Gleisen  Hellblauer Stoff   vielleicht ein Hemd    verknault mit etwas schmutzig Weissem  Wahrscheinlich ist es nur Abfall  irgendwas aus einem Mullsack  der heimlich in das zugewucherte Waldstuck oben am Bahndamm geschleudert wurde  Oder die Sachen wurden von einem der Arbeiter dort liegen gelassen  die am Streckenabschnitt beschaftigt sind  Schliesslich sind sie oft genug hier  Vielleicht war es aber auch ganz anders  Meine Mutter meinte immer  ich hatte eine zu lebhafte Fantasie  Tom meinte das auch  Aber ich kann einfach nicht anders  ich sehe ein paar liegengebliebene Fetzen  ein schmutziges T Shirt oder einen Schuh und muss sofort an den zweiten Schuh denken und an die Fusse  die darin gesteckt haben  Ich habe mich von meinem Sofa direkt in die Szene gerissen gefuhlt und war von der ersten Sekunde an in der Atmosphare der Geschichte gefangen Erzahlt wird die Geschichte zunachst aus der Perspektive von Rachel  sowie Megan  die Rachel zunachst Jess nennt  weil ihr Megan s richtiger Name nicht bekannt ist  Schon die ersten Kapitel bauen eine so gewaltige Spannung auf  dass ich es fast nicht ausgehalten habe zwischen dem Lesen auch noch arbeiten zu gehen  Aus Rachels Sicht lauft Jess  aaah Megan s Leben einfach perfekt  ein toller Mann  ganz sicher einen tollen Job und naturlich ein schones Haus   in der Strasse  in der Rachel fruher selbst gewohnt hat  als ihr Leben noch in Ordnung war  Aus der Sicht von Megan sieht das alles weniger perfekt aus  Ihr Mann ist oft unterwegs  mit ihm lauft es nicht immer rund und besonders Geschehnisse aus ihrer Vergangenheit belasten sie sehr  Genau das macht das Buch aus  Die verschiedenen Blickwinkel  spater auch aus Anna s Sicht  der Nachfolgerin von Rachel in Sachen Ex Mann Tom Das Buch ist auf so vielen Ebenen spannend  ich kann es gar nicht in Worte fassen  Die Charaktere sind toll ausgearbeitet  besitzen Tiefe  ausser Cathy vielleicht  und gewinnen den Leser fur sich  Auch oder vielleicht gerade Rachel  als sehr ungewohnliche Hauptdarstellerin mit Alkoholproblem  arbeitslos und einem gewissen Hang zur Depression und Antriebslosigkeit  lasst keinen kalt Ganz langsam wird man gegen Ende zur Losung gefuhrt  und auch wenn man die Wahrheit dann endlich begriffen hat bleibt die Spannung nicht weg  sondern dann geht es erst richtig los Vollkommen zu Recht ist dieses Buch nicht nur auf der Bestseller Liste des Spiegels mehrere Wochen die Nr 1 gewesen Die Geschichte ist unglaublich spannend  so dass man das Buch nicht mehr weglegen kann  ein absoluter Pageturner  Ich kann nur allen Freunden von Krimis und Thrillern empfehlen sich das Buch auf dem schnellsten Wege zu kaufen und unter keinen Umstanden langer zu warten  denn es ist tatsachlich so  Ihr verpasst sonst was Mehr zu sagen bleibt mir nicht  Vom Inhalt mochte ich schliesslich nichts verraten  aber das Buch ist wirklich super und auf jeden Fall 5 Baumchen und den Kauf wert  I was utterly hooked on this book from start to finish  What an incredible journey full of tension and late nights this book took me on   Admittedly  I had high hopes going into this book as it has been said to be as good as Gone Girl  Let me tell you  it was as good as Gone Girl and maybeee even a little bit better At times I tried to guess how the story will end but eventually I just gave up because every single time I thought I knew everything I was completely wrong  The story was incredible and so complex that I literally couldn t put this book down The main characters throughout the book are not the most likeable I have to say but they were all so intriguing and I just couldn t trust any of them Wish I could read this for the first time again and experience everything once more  Honestly  this book is fantastic   If you want to have a few sleepless nights reading because you re so incredibly hooked on a book then this book is for you  The pacing was so fast and I got completely lost in the story I will not be forgetting this book any time soon  And I will  from now on  be a little more cautious when looking out the train window    Well  I mentioned earlier that I didn t really like any of the characters and now that it s over I still don t  However    this was a GREAT read  Suspenseful and a good ride  I did guess the killer ahead of time  but it was still fun to watch it unravel  I would love to read more by this author  I could not put this book down  I have heard comparisons to Gone Girl but although I can see the writing style  unreliable narrators and alternating points of view  as similar I found the things this book has that Gone Girl is missing is someone to root for and a satisfying ending  The story alternates between Rachel  Megan and Anna  Rachel is a hot mess and an alcoholic who on her daily train ride to London passes a house and imagines she knows the couple who lives there  She invents a whole wonderful life for them  Megan  who is the woman who lives in the house Rachel watches actually has a far less than perfect life  Anna is Rachel s ex husband s new wife  former mistress and neighbor of Megan  Bu kitap ruyalarima girdi  kabusum oldu  Okudugum en akici polisiye gizem romaniydi   belki de ruh halimden filan kaynaklandi ama kitap cok fena akti gitti  D Hatta bir bolumde aglatti bile  Bilmiyorum belki tahmin etmesi kolay bir olaydi ama ben hic bu tur kitaplarda dogru tahminlerde bulunamiyorum  Bu yuzden kitaba benden bes yildiz  D not   bu kitaptan sonra evlilikten korkuyorum  evlilik hakkinda fena suphelerim var  D A must read  In my opinion  way better than Gone Girl  The entire story plot kept your mind alert and thinking what would happen next  After I would turn a page  I would be in awe that something happened because it was the last thing I was expecting  Towards the end of the book  I was in utter shock that Tom was the crazy one  All this time  mentally draining all these women  after he was the nut case all along  He deserved the corkscrew in the neck   bastard  Won t go into too much detail in order not to spoil the book too much  But 5 5 in my eyes  one of the best books I ve read in awhile  would not mind re reading it either  I hope the author comes out with more books  I m a huge fan  Sometimes you read a book that s been hyped up and you can t figure out why  Sometimes it s awful  Sometimes it s OK  And sometimes  just once in a while  you find one that is truly deserving of all the attention  The Girl on the Train is one of those The story is told from three points of view but the primary narrater is Rachel  She s been divorced for a couple of years but still intensely in love with her ex  She is an alcoholic who occasionally suffers blackouts  She takes the train every morning and afternoon to keep up the pretence that she is still going to work   that she hadn t been fired for wandering in drunk and losing an account  She has made up a fantasy about a couple she sees every day from the train who just happen to live a few houses down from her ex husband  from her old house  One day  she sees something different with the house she watches  Then a news report comes out that the woman is missing  Because of this  she inserts herself into the life of the husband while simultaneously causing an uproar in the life of her ex and his new wife I know this sounds very chic lit but it turned very dark  A  who done it  as mainly told from the perspective of a drunk who is never sure if the bits of memory she has are real or imagined  It was a real page turner and a story I just could not put down until I learned the truth  I highly recommend it   Thoroughly enjoyed it  better than Gone Girl  For a 1st book  Paula Hawkins kept me interested the entire read  Congratulations to her  Fast  couldn t put it down read   This was such a brilliantly written book  The story line flowed together effortlessly in a way that made it more than difficult to not keep turning page after gripping page This story  written in somewhat of a diary format  primarily follows Rachel  an alcoholic divorcee on her quest to recover memories lost to the liquor bottle  one of which has her wrapped up in a murder so close to her mind she can barely believe it is real   Barely  During the pages of this book we also meet Anna  the shameless mistress her husband ran off with  and Meghan the innocent  or is she   woman who you need to read this story for This is hands down one of the best books I have read this year  If not ever  I highly recommend this to anyone looking to get deep into a story that leaves you questioning everything you thought to be true until the very last page  I bought this book because of all the great reviews and the comparison to  Gone Girl   which is the only Gillian Flynn book I liked  but this book surpasses it  The plot is intricately woven with the narration of three women and their intersecting lives  The story is suspenseful  smart and I couldn t put the book down until I was finished  There are twists and turns and though I did figure out who the killer was and why  it was still exciting and even more twisty than I imagined Truly  I don t understand all the negative reviews but so many seem to be based on the characters  personalities and weaknesses  I m sorry but this is a murder mystery filled with flawed people which is truly realistic  What were readers expecting  Heroes and perfect  moral characters  How boring would that be as well as unrealistic  So many main characters in literature are flawed  imperfect  weak  tragic  and broken  It s sad that so many people think a character who was abused or who has a drinking problem isn t work reading about or listening to  Each character in this book has their flaws which come out here and there throughout the book  making you realize that what you thought you knew  you didn t know at all  It s also incredible to me that the same people who complained about the flawed characters were also offended by the comparison to  Gone Girl   Because the characters in that book weren t flawed with infidelity  psychopathy and more  The characters in this book are far more redeemable  I loved this book  I would recommend it to anyone and I can t wait to read the next book by this author   This was a marathon  At one side I couldn t stop reading while changing theories a dozen times on how the story could end and the mystery could solved  At the other side I wanted to give me some more time to think about it more and process the things what I just read  In the beginning of the book I almost felt depressed like Rachel did as the reader is really taken into her mind  The perspective on sitting in the train changes as well as the need for alcohol does  I didn t know where the story was heading to in the first quarter of the book  I would say it builds slowly  but then it happens so quickly  The other 3 quarters of the book  sprinting through the pages and not looking backwards until you finished it  Then you ll have time to think  plenty time  In the end  I think this is a very good story  although it is not that innovative as I expected to be  But hey  I enjoyed every single page reading it  It is a thriller story  with a lot of drama build around it in a way that every detail serves as a clue or cause for what happens later  Also things become so personal  like you ask yourself if it is based on personal experiences of the writer  The lies build on lies  becoming bigger lies  The stupid and hazardous actions  of whose you know you ll regret them later  This is a very good book  with a nice story  I liked it   This book has been on my TBR shelf since it first made the New York Times Bestseller list  Considering the fact that it costs about  10 just for the ebook  I was a bit apprehensive about spending that much for an author I had never read before  That is until the Gods of eBook Sales and Impoverished College Students shined down on the reader world and put this book on sale for a limited time  I grabbed it as soon as I could I will not lie  The first 20  of the book I was pretty confused  I wasn t sure exactly where the novel was headed or what exactly was going on  My thoughts were pretty jumbled  However  that did not lessen my interest in the book whatsoever  If anything  it only raised the amount of suspense and intrigue  I ended up finishing the entire book in about a day and a half I m gonna try and give you my review without spoiling anything for you which is not an easy task and you will see why once you read it We get three different points of view from Rachel  Megan and Anna  One startling aspect about this novel that surprised me was that you will not view these women as productive citizens of the world or as role models in any way  shape or form  They are incredibly flawed and have a boat load of issues  Let s sum up these three characters Rachel Rachel is the main protagonist  She is The girl on the train  She has suffered from alcoholism for several years  She has been fired from her job and basically ostracized from her former friends due to her drinking addiction  Her life is not going anywhere at the time of these events  She s lost control over many facets and cannot seem to find the strength or the will to get her life back on track  no pun intended   She spends every single day riding the train and wasting time  She likes to see a particular couple on her daily commute who live right by the train tracks  She fantasizes about what their lives must be like until one day she sees something shocking and feels the need to intervene  It was difficult to like Rachel at times because she makes many mistakes throughout the course of the novel  I understand why she did them  but at the same time I wanted so badly to shake her by the shoulders to make her stop spiraling downward Megan Megan is one half of the couple that Rachel likes to watch on her commute  She seems to have the perfect life according to Rachel s fantasies  She is married to Scott   a handsome man who showers her with affection  However  as the novel progresses we get to see a side of Megan that is filled with the negative consequences from her dark past Anna Anna is yet another character that is difficult to like  She is the bitter enemy of Rachel  She is constantly looking for ways to get Rachel out of her life for good  She also happens to be one of the reasons why Rachel is so utterly miserable  Anna was the mistress that helped destroy Rachel s marriage and is now married to Tom  Rachel s ex husband  and lives just a few houses down from Megan and Scott On a seemingly normal day  Rachel witnesses events that entwine all of their lives together and will test each of their bonds and sanity I don t think I have ever had so many theories for just one novel in my life  It seemed as if every few pages I was adding a new theory to the mix  I must give Paula credit for being able to successfully keep me on my toes  By the end  I really had no idea who the culprit was and since all of the characters are flawed  it made it even harder to narrow it down This book has been repeatedly compared to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn  Gone Girl is one of my favorite books and I was a bit skeptical that The Girl on the Train would live up to its standards  However  I can completely understand why those comparisons were made now that I have read the book  They do not have the same plot or similar characters  but both books give off a certain vibe  They are both psychological thrillers that will keep you guessing the entire time  Omg i just finished this  including the fact that im sooo busy with school stuff i could say that i finished this book so so fast  And i loooooveeeeddd it  That plow thought of my gosh fantastic For all you who havent read this book or for all of you others who have really low ratings about it i suggest you reread it again this book has very complex charachters that have a great character development throught the reading  its a very very deep book and also complicated you should read it very slow to understand every word and every action when i was reading it i was in a such a diffwrent world it happened like i was there at the moment and it was smth i havent expirienced in the past books that i ve been reading lately  Toatally a 5 star rating and i would totally recommand this book to anyone who likes complex books and is a great fan of phsycological thrillers just like me    A wonderfully woven tale of intersecting lives  secrets  betrayals  and jaw dropping revelations   One of the best thrillers I ve read in a long time  Kudos to the author   I highly recommend this book  a must read  Adrienne ThompsonAuthor of See Me I picked this book up not knowing that I would be instantly gripped  I couldn t put it down until I read the last word    Girl on the Train  is creepy and filled with desperate characters  Nothing and no one are what they first appear and the plot twists in disturbing ways  The fantasies people create in a state of pain and desperate loneliness are dangerous indeed   Unreliable but not UnreadableI admit  the title of this book interested me  but when people told me the story featured an unreliable narrator  I stayed away  Books with unreliable narrators can be good  don t get me wrong  but there are so many bad ones that I m leery of buying one and wasting my money and time  This book finally won me over though  and I m so glad I gave it a chance  because it really is a great book At first I was very confused  of course  given that the narrator s of the story don t know what s going on themselves  but I was also trying to read the book a chapter at a time over different days  and that doesn t help with the confusion  This book is best read in one sitting  which suited me anyway because I found it almost impossible to put down  There s violence  of course  and some of the characters are exasperating at times  but the book is so well written that it s definitely worth a read  I enjoyed this  I think I would have enjoyed it more had there not been so many Gone Girl comparisons made by the critics  This had me expecting and waiting for the shocking character twist  It came  and I probably would have been shocked hadi not expected it  I liked the narration constantly shifted back and forth between three characters  The dramatic irony really kept the plot nicely paced and moving  Even though the main character Rachel was a pathetic loser  I found myself becoming more and more sympathetic as the novel progressed  I won t say that she redeemed herself at the end  but I did feel she deserved the respite from unhappiness that she ended up with  I also think that canned gin and tonics sound like a really interesting idea   This was a delightfully twisty thriller  I wasn t so sure because it kept getting compared to Gone Girl  which I hated  but I hated it because it didn t hold up and the characters didn t hold me either  This isn t the case for  The Girl on the Train  where I was kept up half the night with a need to know what on earth was happening It s all told in first person by increasingly unreliable narrators  as their lives and worlds are called into question  I think you could do a personality test on women by asking who  out of the three main female characters and the three narrators  who you found most sympathetic  For me it was definitely Megan  who s pain and independence really drew me in Without giving too much away  I d say that it felt like Broadchurch meets Pretty Little Liars on a train   the narrators are dealing with secrets  lies  and crimes that get increasingly complex  combat with police who don t seem to understand while trying to protect themselves and their families from those same police  and try to come to terms with disturbing revelations about themselves and those they love  Very satisfying read  Listened to the MP3 audio book  which is how I consume many books these days  I highly recommend listening to Girl on the Train as the voice work is excellent Read this in 5 days  so obviously I loved it  The POV style here is fascinating because rather than a typical story told by multiple characters in which the truth remains regardless of character  the incomplete inaccurate knowledge of each voice makes for a much more gripping tale  In addition  this unique use of POV feels far more true to life in that no one ever truly knows another person s motive or true self  The series of misinterpretations indeed becomes part of the narrative and clouds the truth very effectively to keep the reader engaged Beyond the human characters  I was also struck by the inanimate characters in this story  the train  the gray restless sea  the rain  More than background or context  they influence the story in real ways The Girl on the Train reads like a story based on true events  each character utterly believable  I found myself casting the movie and feel like we can bank on that happening in the near future  Couldn t put it down  Couldn t wait to get to the end to see if I d guessed  who dun it   Loved the way it was written  Loved the ending  Highly recommend  Such a good read I didn t want it to endMan  this was a good book  It reminded me a little bit of Gone Girl  parts of it anyway  the relationship between Megan and Scott and how she couldn t seem to be happy with one  Although in this story  she didn t turn out to be the crazy one  At first I didn t know why we needed Anna s poverty but as I got further into the book  it made more sense  She had a story to tell  just like the other two  And I think  without her part  the stories wouldn t have been as connected  especially Rachel s and the ending might not have been as great  And the ending took me surprise although I had narrowed down my list of suspects to two  but I still couldn t believe who the culprit turned out to be  The writing was so engaging that I felt like I was on the train with Rachel  I can t wait to see what this author comes up with next  Why five stars  Cause I loved it  It knocked my socks off  if I wore socks that is   but I don t and insist on running around barefoot in the house I was in the mood for a good thriller and I guess I found it  Didn t have high hopes for the book as its been given mixed reviews and compared  a lot  to Gone Girl  and with a mixed review book it can go either way  Main characters are gritty and un likeable which really works for the story  the plot is simple in hindsight  but has been given great twists and turns by the author and keeps you guessing till the end  Pace of the book is good and it doesn t get boring or drag needlessly  That is exactly what one wants from a mystery thriller  Its not high prose but its well written and kept me hooked and that s all I wanted  so five stars   The Girl On The Train by Paula Hawkins is so good that you have to occasionally remind yourself that this is her debut novel  A fact that should have all mystery readers excited for what is to come Rachel rides the commuter train every morning  passing a stretch of suburbia she once belonged to  She watches the couples in their homes  One she knows too well and the other she dreams about  Her dream couple is Jason and Jess  They are idyllic  In love  young  attentive  with their whole lives ahead of them  The other couple are Tom and Anna and they are why her life is destroyed    I am not the girl I used to be  I am no longer desirable  I m off putting in some way  It s not just that I ve put on weight  or that my face is puffy from the drinking and the lack of sleep  it s as if people can see the damage written all over me  can see it in my face  the way I hold myself  the way I move  On night last week  when I left my room to get myself a glass of water  I overheard Cathy talking to Damien  her boyfriend  in the living room  I stood in the hallway and listened   She s lonely   Cathy was saying   I really worry about her  It doesn t help  her being alone all the time   Then she said   Isn t there someone from work  maybe  or the rugby club   and Damien said   For Rachel  Not being funny  Cath  but I m not sure I know anyone that desperate    Rachel was married to Tom once  Then Anna came along and then the baby and Rachel was left  Tossed aside  For a younger  prettier  fertile version of herself  Now every morning  as she rides the train  She watches as she passes by their lives  going on  Passing her by  But truth be told  Rachel doesn t always just pass by  Sometimes she gets off  Sometimes she goes to Tom and Anna s home  Angry  Hurt  Drunk  But then  Rachel is always drunk now  Drunk and broken  With a memory missing large chunks from it     One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl   Three for a girl  I m stuck on three  I just can t get any further  My head is thick with blood  Three for a girl  I can hear the magpies they re laughing  mocking me  a raucous cackling  A tiding  Bad tidings  I can see them now  black against the sun  Not the birds  something else  Someone s coming  Someone is speaking to me  Now look  Now look what you made me do    Rachel is failing at moving on  Too tired and too often too drunk to make anything of her life  That is why she needs Jason and Jess  Her perfect couple  They lead the life she once had  Until the day  Until she sees something from the train that changes everything  But who will believe her  Who will trust her  The Girl on the Train is compelling and emotionally taxing  You will be angry and at once supportive of Rachel as she tries to piece together what she believes she has seen through the fog of her alcohol impaired memories  She is at times so damaged  that there is a sense of overwhelming hopelessness  which is what makes her attempts to do the right thing so courageous  Or is she simply fighting for attention  To matter once again when she is devoid of any self worth There is also a real mystery here  The story told through the voices of three women  Rachel  Anna and Megan  Each with their own demons  Each with their own self afflictions  Each trying to make the most of their bad decisions But it is Rachel who drives the train so to speak  Rachel who must set right the wrong she knows has happened  Rachel that makes the Girl on the Train so unforgettable A terrific debut  A terrific read   Very interesting  many twists and turns   and some hard moments to read through as well  Kept me very engaged  Well written   Recensione completa http   peccati di penna blogspot it 2   Il romanzo mette in moto la mente  il lettore inizia a sospettare di tutti e a ipotizzare  cosi come fa la protagonista  Ho trovato la lettura intrigante e appassionante  molto fruibile e godibile  per nulla pesante  Ovviamente  oltre ai lati positivi di questa lettura trainante  ci sono alcuni negativi  reputo alcuni passaggi sono un po  confusi  la narrazione avviene attraverso 3 POV  Rachel  la protagonista  Anna  la nuova moglie di Tom  terrorizzata da Rachel  Megan  la ragazza scomparsa misteriosamente  Oltre a questi cambi di personaggio abbiamo anche passaggi dal presente al passato  Insomma  questi salti destabilizzano  ma niente di eclatante La ragazza del treno mi e piaciuto molto  se come me non siete lettori di thriller questo potrebbe essere un romanzo di iniziazione  Scoprite anche voi che fine fara Rachel e dov e finita Megan  The premise of The Girl on the Train is intriguing from the very beginning  We all have an inner voyeur which draws us to the lives of others  Rachel gives in to hers with a spectacular display of inventive fantasy  making up alternate universes to make sense of the lives she sees played out each day as her train passes by  When one of her favorite characters disappears  she is compelled to launch herself into the lives of those she used to watch from afar  Will she find that their reality is aligned with her made up stories  or will roles be reversed  Is the missing woman a victim or a perpetrator  Is Rachel herself a credible witness to the events passing by on the train  Complex  character driven and speeding like a freight train  The Girl on the Train is a wild and entertaining mystery ride  I loved it from beginning to end  Despite the quicksilver pace  the various mysteries unraveled agonizingly slowly  The voice alternates between three women  Rachel  our nosy traveler  Anna  her ex s new wife  and Megan  the missing girl  Each woman steps forward and tells her tale and the story comes together one bit at a time to the stunning conclusion  Recommended for those who enjoyed Before I Go to Sleep and The Silent Wife   How can you despise every character yet feel sorry for them just a few sentences later  How can you clutch onto their every move yet give up on them in a heartbeat  This is  The Girl on the Train  and this is an Author that knows how to write a true page turner  A fantastic novel written with such precision that it simply leaves you dumbfounded every step of the way  You think you have it all figured out but the Author throws a curveball that puts you back at the start  A truly fantastic read  recommended to all those who love a page turner or those craving a bit of uncertainty in their lives   Simply brilliant   I literally couldn t put this book down  I  ironically  started reading it on my train to university and spent the majority of the day waiting for lectures to end so I could get back to it The characters  Rachel and Megan Jess in particular  are brilliantly thought out  and despite their flaws and mistakes it was difficult to dislike any of them  The twists and turns never stopped  but  unlike in some books  they didn t feel as though they were added just to throw the reader  but as if  should you look back  you would see all the clues fitting together perfectly This is a fantastic book and one  if I may say so  that I feel would be adapted into a fantastic film too 5 5 would recommend   ert  ert i sauket eso t rileri

narrators were all horrible  complete assholes  It felt like a combination of Gone Girl and Before I Go to Sleep  but good  The pacing was great  it was entertaining  it kept me reading and guessing   We re all guilty of it  The house on the corner  a jogger you pass every morning  each are given a place in your own little universe  Your mind fantasizes names and back stories  You ll never actually visit that house or have a conversation with the runner  but you know them  But what if one day you woke to find the house destroyed or the jogger missing  Meet struggling alcoholic Rachel  She is angry  ashamed  and intimately knows the route and landscape of the train she takes every day  She s carefully watched the houses and people along the rail line  After witnessing an act if infidelity from afar  the infuriated and bitter Rachel spends a night spent in a drunken haze only to find the next morning that the adulteress has mysteriously disappeared With a damaging reputation that precedes her  emotional scars that have yet to heal  and a passion for justice  Rachel beings to untangle the truth of what really happened that night  Wrapped in lies  contempt  and unrequited lust  this brilliant thriller will captivate you till the last breathtaking page   This deserves all the freaking hype  indeed  Definitely looking forward to watching the movie in 2016 This is the kind of book that s so good it makes me envious  makes me wanting to be able to write a story like this  It started out a bit slow  but soon it s picking up pace and became so engaging I barely able to stop reading  All the characters are fucked up people  I think that s one of the reasons why I love this  Though I find it quite distressing that almost all people are violent when they get angry  But I think that s because the author wanted the reader to suspect all people  Nobody can be trusted  Nobody is decent The only thing why this doesn t go to my favourite shelf is because I don t really like the amount of violence and creepiness in this book  I m an early bird  and therefore I m usually in bed by 9PM   sometimes earlier  The fact that was I was up until 11PM finishing the book should give you a pretty good indication of how into it I was  It s so satisfying to get your hands on a good book and being so immersed by the story that you devour it in just a few sittings  would have been one if I didn t have to work  The book had me on the edge of my seat  constantly wondering where it was going and what would happen next  It was gripping  enthralling and suspenseful  a great riveting thriller    Rachel Watson rides the train into London each day to get to work  Her train happens to stop across from one particular house almost every day  and Rachel has created imaginary identities  Jason and Jess  for the man and woman she sees frequently in their back garden  When Rachel hears the news about a missing woman named Megan  she soon realizes that Megan is her  Jess   and she becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her The story is told from three separate perspectives   Rachel  her ex husband s new wife Anna  and the missing woman  Megan  Each woman knows only a part of the story  and we are left to piece it together as we go  This book kept me on the edge of my seat from the first page right up to the very end  It s full of terrible people  pitiful people  and broken people  Both Rachel and Megan had me wanting to alternately shake them  and then give them hugs to comfort them  I felt emotionally exhausted after finishing the book  but I didn t walk away empty handed  There are several life lessons to be taken away at the end 1  Men are not to be trusted 2  People are not always what they seem 3  If he does it with you  he will do it to you 4  Women are not to be trusted 5  Alcohol can be your best friend and your worst enemy  Both at the same time 6  Therapy can help 7  Your memories are not to be trusted 8  Life is pain 9  People lie   A lot  10  If you do everything right  nothing can go wrong   Wait  I think that was supposed to say everything can go wrong     Rating  5  5Ce minunata este viata cand reusesti sa dai peste o carte care sa te prinda asa de bine intre paginile ei   Asa am patit eu cu Fata din tren de Rachel Hawkins  o carte despre care auzisem atat de multe lucruri Am observat ca aceasta carte este extrem de populara si multi cititori o urasc pentru acest simplu fapt  considerand ca este o carte care prinde la publicul care  citeste o singura carte pe an   Eu nu sunt de acord cu acest lucru avand in vedere ca foarte multi cititori inraiti au adorat aceasta carte asa ca mi se pare chiar o jignire cand afirmi asa ceva  Da  parerile sunt impartite dar este bine sa nu aratam cu degetul spre ceilalti cititori  mai ales spre cei care citesc des Actiunea acestei carti m a atras inca din primele capitole si am realizat ca dupa aproximatix 100 de pagini aveam senzatia ca deja citisem mult mai mult decat o facusem  Protagonista acestei carti este o tipa pe nume Rachel  o alcoolica parasita de sotul ei si ramasa fara slujba  In fiecare zi ea ia acelasi tren cu care merge la slujba ei inexistenta din Londra  In timpul calatoriei cu trenul aceasta de multe ori bea si analizeaza oamenii din jurul ei si parerea acestora despre ea  dar cel mai mult ea este interesata de o anumita casa pe care o vede din tren  In aceasta casa locuiesc doua personaje pe care ea le porecleste Jess si Jason iar acestea ii inspira perfectiunea de care ea nu mai are parte Mi s a parut extrem de interesanta cartea si a fost fain sa poti urmari povestea din perspectiva mai multor personaje si in diverse perioade de timp  Principalele personaje feminine se pare ca au o legatura intre ele  legatura pe care nici nu o poti distinge decat dupa o analiza mai completa  Personajele nu sunt perfecte  relatiile dintre acestea de asemenea scartaie foarte mult si fiecare personaj are ceva de ascuns din trecutul cu care nu se poate impaca Rachel  pe cat de disperata de a participa la ceva interesant si de a incerca sa rezolve o posibila crima  nu mi s a parut in mod special un personaj lipsit de speranta  Are extrem de multe defecte  traieste in trecutul care o bantuie zilnic  in amintirile pe care nu le poate vedea cu claritate  dar pe parcurs se vede ca are parte de o evolutie  nelasandu se intimidata ca in trecut Toate personajele feminine au ceva in comun  trecand prin niste drame care le fac sa clacheze la un moment dat  Intalnim destula violenta in aceasta carte in timp ce urmarim si drama unei alcoolice care nu isi poate aminti momente din viata ei  momente ce vor fi definitorii pentru a realiza cine este ea cu adevarat si ca vina nu ii apartine in totalitate Nu mi a placut de doamna detectiv Riley intrucat  la fel ca si Rachel  am urat o pur si simplu inca din prima clipa  Este ciudat cum uneori un personaj nu iti poate placea chiar dinainte sa stii ceva anume despre el  Detectivul Riley mi s a parut ca ar avea ceva personal cu Rachel si cred ca si ea a simtit acest lucru  Nu stiu daca aceasta a fost doar senzatia mea insa imi pare rau ca la acest capitol nu am reusit sa aflu disting mai multe detalii Acest thriller m a tinut cu sufletul la gura pana la ultima pagina si mi a demonstrat cum viata nu este perfecta iar de multe ori trebuie sa ne alegem cu grija oamenii din jurul nostru pentru ca acestia ne pot distruge la un moment dat daca nu suntem indeajuns de puternici Daca nu ati citit cartea pana acum sper sa o faceti cat mai curand pentru ca este una dintre cele mai bune carti pe care am citit o in ultima perioada   Sper sa mai pot gasi carti asa de antrenante  care ma fac si pe mine sa ma simt ca un detectiv in actiune Citate   Cum a putut Jess sa faca una ca asta  Ce e cu ea  Uita te la viata pe care o au impreuna  cat e de frumoasa  N am inteles niciodata cum pot oamenii sa nesocoteasca flagrant  cu asemenea usurinta  durerea pe care o pot provoca  urmandu si inima  Cine a zis ca e bine sa ti urmezi inima  E egoism pur  un egoism care distruge totul    p 47  N a inteles niciodata cum de era posibil sa ti fie dor de ceva ce n ai avut niciodata  cum putea sa te doara    p 107  Astazi  lumina e proasta  vremea s a schimbat  cerul e de plumb  amenintator  Nu reusesc sa vad in casa  nu mi dau seama ce se intampla  Sunt de a dreptul disperata  Nu suport sa fiu lasata pe dinafara   e bine sau e rau  acum sunt parte din povestea asta  Trebuie sa stiu ce se intampla    p 118  Totusi  sentimentul acela familar de groaza creste in momentul in care trenul opreste la semnal si aproape ca mi e frica sa mi ridic privirea  Fereastra e inchisa  nu mai e nimic acolo  E liniste  e pace  Sau poate ca totul a fost abandonat  Scaunul lui Megan e inca pe terasa  gol  E cald azi  dar eu nu ma pot opri din tremurat    p 288  Plaja e pustie si e atat de frig  incat trebuie sa mi incordez maxilarele ca sa nu mi mai clantane dintii  Merg repede de a lungul fasiei de prundis  dincolo de vestiare  atat de frumoase in lumina zilei  atat de sinistre acum  fiecare din ele  o posibila ascunzatoare  Cand vantul se inteteste  cabinele prind viata  scandurile de lemn scartaie  si  impreuna cu vuietul marii  par a fi niste soapte  cineva sau ceva se apropie    p 402   Best book I read in a long time     Brilliant  Loved it  Couldn t put it down   When the main character is an admitted alcoholic and liar without much going for her I would normally not give the book much of a chance  But  Rachel s fascination with making up stories about the couple who lived in a house she saw from her train window twice a day reminded me of Hitchcock s Rear window and knowing how much I loved it I kept reading  And  boy am I glad I did  The Girl on the Train is a stunning novel of psychological suspense with a host of possibly unreliable witnesses  I couldn t wait to find out if they were all lying  or if they were just fooling themselves about what they thought happened  For all of those readers waiting for the next Gone Girl I think this is it  This was my first thriller suspense novel and I could not put this book down  I really enjoyed the multiple perspectives and the importance of dates  Even though I am far from middle ages  divorced  depressed  or drunk  I found the main character  Rachel  very relatable  At some points in the book I loathed some of the characters but at other points I found myself feeling sorry for the same characters  I figured out the guilty person about halfway through the novel but it was still very interesting to find out how everything played out  As an American  I also loved that the book took place around London  The writing in this novel was very gripping   Great book   Very exciting  The main character  Rachel  is a woman who is a depressed alcoholic because her ex husband  Tom  left her for another woman  Anna   Rachel took the train every day to work  but after she got fired from her job she continued to take the train everyday to hide the fact from her roommate that she got fired  Every morning on the train  Rachel passes a certain couple  their names are Scott and Megan  living in an apartment by the train  and fantasizes about having the  seemingly  perfect life that this couple has  However  one day Rachel sees Megan kissing another man  and when Megan suddenly disappears  Rachel decides that she must get involved in finding out what happened to Megan  Rachel reaches out to Scott and they become friends  sort of   however  Tom and Anna happen to live near Megan and Scott  and so all their lives come to intersect in a beautiful mess  I think this book is very well written because it definitely keeps you guessing about what happened to Megan  Some other minor characters are brought into the fray  but in the end you find out what really happened to Megan  There was a point in the book when it mentions a  her   but later on in the book you realize that the  her  is referring to a different woman than the one you expected Wonderful book  would read again   Really hard to figure out who committed the murder   Lots of twists I liked it   This book is interesting reading on several levels  There s the plot level  who is responsible for the disappearance that occurs some 20  of the way into the book  Is it a disappearance  There s also some mystery with the narrators themselves  None of them is reliable  either by omission or because   well  no spoilers The Girl on the Train is plot driven  so my synopsis must be brief  An English woman is obsessed with her ex husband and still dreams of the life they used to have before he left her  Every day  on the train to London  she passes by a house that stands next to where they used to live  She fantasizes about the people she sees in that backyard and invents lives for them  One day  she sees something from the train that shocks her  and the days and weeks that follow lead her  and the reader  to question everything she s seen before Above all  the best thing about this book is how the male characters  who drive the action forward  are all in the background  The women in this novel seem to be acting as pawns  driven by their fascination with the perfect man  the perfect home  and the perfect suburban life  I wonder what each of these narrators would be without their obsession with status  control  and fulfillment gained through  the ideal man   Behind closed doors  none of these men is ideal  either  which we find out pretty early Paula Hawkins has deep sympathy for these narrators  each of whom  especially Rachel  makes the reader cringe every time she makes questionable choices  But for what  Is society driving these women to lead desperate  even quietly desperate  lives  Are their goals unattainable The choice of a train is fascinating  because  like these narrators  lives  the path of a train is fixed  There is the idea of movement  a destination  even a beautiful one  but no deviation is allowed The final scene of this novel occurs near the beach in northern England  where the stormy gray sea is simultaneously colorless and tumultuous  At the risk of being sentimental  which is my habit  there is a strong parallel between the choppy water and these women  who are emotionally limited and moved by forces they cannot control A terrific read  This was a very engaging book  I liked the way the story was told from the POVs of the three main women in the story  There was great character development throughout and the concept of an outsider looking in  discovering the secrets of other people s lives is fascinating  This book is compared to Gone Girl  which I think is BS  They aren t similar and this book is fantastic on it s own  I want to know what the next The Girl on the Train will be   I actually listened to the audio book but am going to hunt for a paper back copy to own as well  I found this a compelling story   I d heard about the unreliable narrator but  isn t that what we all are  Telling our view of the world through our own hurts  prejudices  fears and dreams  Because we are  limited  to Rachel then Megan and then Anna s POV  the sleuthing has to happen between the lines and I loved the construction of this  who dunnit   The story was exceptionally well written and the characters completely F  ked up  as many people are  which made it at once difficult to like them but difficult to dismiss them Ending great  High recommend  Everyone is messed up and acting very strange  Cheaters  liars  drunks  philanderers  killers  stalkers   this story has got it all  And yet they seem like normal people  Everyone is a suspect  You don t know who to trust  And  true to form  the lying continues to the very last page Definitely kept my attention  Loved this book    I couldn t put it down  Like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo   you have to suffer through the 1st  intro section    but without that  you have no background  no insight  no way for the Author to led you in your thought process by those context clues   that may or may not led you to proper thinking   Couldn t put it down after the bland section Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and every night  Every day she rattles over the same track junctions  flashes past the same stretch of cozy suburban homes  And every day she stops at the same signal and she sees the same couple  breakfasting on their roof deck  living the perfect life that Rachel craves for herself   a lifestyle she recently lost  She looks forward to observing this household every morning  even makes up names and narratives for its residents  Then one day Rachel sees someone new in their garden  and soon after  the woman who lived there disappears  Unable to keep this information to herself  Rachel offers what she knows to the police  and in the process is drawn into the lives of the couple she thought of as Jason and Jess but whose names   she has learned from the news   are really Megan and Scott Hipwell  But the police accuse Rachel of being unreliable  and it s true that her memories can t always be trusted  Plus there are the stories that her ex husband s new wife has been spreading about her  By the time Megan s body is found  Rachel is in over her head  intricately entangled in the details of the investigation  as well as in the lives of everyone involved  Has she put others in danger  Has she done more harm than good  A compulsively readable  emotionally immersive  Hitchcockian thriller that draws comparisons to Gone Girl  The Silent Wife  or Before I Go to Sleep  this is an electrifying debut embraced by listeners across markets and categories  The girl on the train foi o primeiro livro  em meses  que eu li sempre que tive 5 minutos para o fazer  a prova e que o li em 4 dias  A premissa do livro consiste na vida de Rachel e na forma como  quase involuntariamente  ela acaba envolvida em situacoes muito desagradaveis  Mal comecamos a ler o livro percebemos que a vida da Rachel e recheada de pequenos misterios que vao sendo desvendados ao longo do livro Nos primeiros capitulos percebemos que ela vai para Londres todos os dias de comboio e na sua viagem passa sempre por um conjunto de casas que ela gosta de observar  especialmente uma delas  em que ela ve um casal para o qual inventa nomes e vidas  Tudo corre muito bem ate Rachel assistir a algo que a perturba muito e acaba por se envolver numa situacao que lhe trara muitos dissabores Uma coisa que logo a partida achei fascinante e a questao da perspectiva da realidade que este livro traduz tao bem  as vezes achamos que as coisas sao de uma certa maneira por nossa culpa ou porque alguem nos faz acreditar nisso  no entanto  muitas vezes na nossa vida  interpretamos coisas de uma forma errada porque criamos uma ilusao relativamente a algo  Nunca disse que esta review seria facil de ler  mas se lerem o livro vao perceber perfeitamente Depois amei o facto de que nunca estava a contar com os grandes twists da historia  claro que a autora faz de proposito  no entanto  acho fascinante como ela conseguiu dirigir tao bem uma historia com tanto suspense Apetece me  berrar  aqui uma serie de spoilers mas nao o vou fazer porque quero que voces leiam e amem e fiquem tao pasmados como eu  O poder que as pessoas podem exercer sobre outras chega a ser extraordinario Em suma  este livro tem imenso suspense  boas personagens  bem descritas  e inteligente  e assustador e foi dos melhores livros  no sentido de entretenimento e nao de qualidade  que li nos ultimos tempos  Isto nao e um livro de culto  no entanto  dentro do genero de livro que e  ou seja  para entreter  e um excelente livro que cumpre na perfeicao a sua funcao  One of the best books I ve read this year  Rachel is unreliable and self sabotaging  and the story is simply terrifying  A must read for anyone traveling home for the holidays  Really enjoyed this book  bought it this morning and finished in a matter of hours  I really enjoyed the writing style and the story was laid out so it was difficult to determine who was guilty  at some point I considered almost every character a viable suspect  Although at points one character began to annoy me with their actions this was I realized a part of the character  that character needed to be that way to be realistic and to make the book as good as it was  I would recommend this book and would definitely read another by this author   I hated all the characters in this book  but that doesn t make this a bad book  In fact  it is a fantastic book  the character developments are REALLY good  All the characters are coming to life  and the book kept me guessing till the very last  The ending was a total mind fuck  I did not expect it AT ALL  it is just awesome  I know people are comparing it with Gone Girl  and many of them are hating The Girl On The Train  saying its nothing like Gone Girl  I never read Gone Girl before  so I can t really make a judgement between them  The only thing I can say is  this is a amazing book  maybe even one of my favourite  Efter lite seg inledning tar boken fart och det ar svart att lagga den ifran sig Skickligt vaver forfattaren ihop handlingen och trollbinder lasaren  Upplosningen ar mycket ovantad och en riktig rysare Vill du ha en spannande thriller for att stracklasa ar detta en perfekt bok for dig Beskrivning av boken Alkoholiserade och arbetslosa Rachel tar taget samma tid  varje dag  Varje dag betraktar Rachel det unga vackra paret i huset intill sparet  Jason och Jess kallar hon dem  I Rachels ogon ar deras liv perfekt  Tills hon en dag ser ut genom tagfonstret och upptacker nagot som skakar om henne totalt  Ett par dagar senare vaknar Rachel

Girl    Jens Peterson  Aftonbladet En beroendeframkallande bladvandare    Metro Arets mest efterlangtade psykologiska thriller    Sunday Times En imponerande debutthriller    The Guardian 4 5 stars    better than I expected  Books with alot of hype  it s 60 40 for me most of the time   the 60  being I either  don t care for it and couldn t finish or I did finish it but couldn t see how it was so popular This one fell into the latter 40   for the most part    The writing kept me interested  slowly weaving things together with the different POVs  and filling in the background and laying the groundwork for everyone  No one is a saint in this you find out  as different revelations and secrets come to the surface  Things you think you know or guess are up ended later on and other leave you with a sense of dread and fascination  I found myself going back and forth a few times with different characters Rachel is    difficult to sympathize with  Actually  while I liked parts of each narrator I didn t particularly care for any of them and yet I did care  if that makes sense   The best way I can put it  Around 39  is when it became even more compelling for me  It was very hard to put down and I found myself going through my morning routine faster to get started on it The twist I suspected near to when it happened  but it was a fleeting thought at first  I actually was thinking of someone else entirely before the the true perp showed their colors  It was surprising but also not a  big twist  really  to me anyway   It was shocking and cold blooded in the end but it also felt   been there done that  in a way The dread and uncertainty almost felt like it s own person at times  watching from the shadows   ready to pounce when the moments where right It was done very well don t get me wrong  I just wasn t as stunned as I should have been  Still  this was an excellent read and I would recommend it  just don t read too many reviews first     Would I read again  Probably   It s a good book to get lost in Happy reading  Did I just stay up all night reading  Sure did  AmI too creeped out to ever sleep again  Yup  Fans of Gone Girl  pick this up ASAP  This just sucked me in and wouldn t let go  Rachel is a complete mess  and you can t help but shake your head at her decisions throughout  but even as I recognized all her self deception and poor choices  I was rooting for her somehow  She has enough residual intelligence and grit that she remains sympathetic and compelling Hawkins has woven a completely alluring mystery with the unreliable narration and the slow revelations of three different but connected women  all while managing to juggle a spliced timeline for maximum dramatic effect I ll say no more   just go check it out  The Girl on The Trainmn lmfrwD

for a week    Absolutely phenomenal  Wow  just wow  Could not put it down    Good read  Couldn t put it down  One of the best suspense novels I have read  Felt like I was on the train  I didn t think I would like this book very much at first  as it s a bit dreary in its tone  and the characters are not particularly likable as other reviewers have noted  But I soon found myself rooting for the main character anyway and   more importantly   I got hooked  I wanted to find out who the killer was  and everyone looked like a plausible suspect up until the end  The book was so well constructed that this was one of the rare times I had to immediately go back and re read some of the chapters  It is a bit reminiscent of the first half of Gone Girl when you don t know who is good or bad  In the end  a thoroughly absorbing read  My wife recommended this book and she reads books at a much higher level than I do  So I was a little skeptical about this book and it started in the first person  a little intimidating  But after the second chapter I became drawn in by the three first person characters and above all the mystery Since it s a story told by it s three main female characters you feel intimately involved with each of them This is by far one my top 5 favorite mystery novels  I found myself unable to stop reading with the tension building to the final sentence leaving you feeling totally satiated and wondering how this author could possible top this work   The Girl on the Train by Paula HawkinsThis is a book  I wanted to read for a long time  so  when finding it for a one week loan in the library in Karlskrona  I grabbed it  Ok  it is translated into Swedish  but still    I was a little bit nervous since it had got such raving reviews from almost everyone  and I was afraid that my expectations were too high  I did not have to worry  This book caught my attention right away  and I had difficulties putting it down and I finished it the same day Rachel takes the commuter train from Ashbury to London every day  Having lived herself along the same railway line  she continues to keep an eye on the houses on her old street  She tries to ignore No  25 since her ex husband lives there with his new wife and their daughter  She still has not come to terms with the divorce and is harassing the couple with phone calls and e mails  However  she has discovered a young couple at No  15  of which she gets somewhat obsessed  She gives them the names Jess and Jason and imagine their happy lives  compared to her own miserable life  We slowly learn that the mixed gin and tonic Rachel drinks on the train on a Friday evening going home  is just the beginning of a trip into oblivion  Her drinking sprees make her wake up with very vague remembrances of what she has been doing  One day she reads in the paper that Jess  although her name is Megan  is missing  Two things come to her mind  the day she saw Megan kiss a stranger in the garden  which made Rachel quite upset with her at the time  and the vague memory that she was in the neighbourhood when Megan disappeared  She contacts the police to share her information  and gets questioned herself It is impossible to tell more of the story without making spoilers  and this is too good to be spoiled  A psychological thriller at its very best  The story is told from the views of Rachel  Megan and Anna  the wife of the ex husband   and evolves little by little  What you think you know  is not what it turns out to be A fantastic  thrilling story which does not reveal the culprit until the very end  It is Paula Hawkins first book  which makes it even more admirable  The female characters  that make up the main part of the story  are very well drawn  and we are there and suffer with them  At least for Rachel  I felt like I wanted her to take a hold on her life and get back to the person she once was  Her problems were very well described  and you felt with her in all her misery Dreamwork has bought the film rights and it seems that Tate Taylor will direct  Will be interesting to see who will play the parts of Rachel  Megan and Anna  Something to wait for as well as for another book by Paula Hawkins From my blog thecontentreader blogspot com Great book   Was unsure of this book to start with    maybe it was because of all the hype it had received  but I am glad I decided to read it now   I found it easy to read  I loved the plot  the twist and turns    and I could identify with the characters   it had me gripped     The only thing I was a little upset with was the ending   I thought it was weak     after all that intense drama to have an ending like that was slightly rubbish     maybe the author just got fed up and run out of ideas     but on the other hand with an ending like that there is room for a book 2       maybe  Lots of moving parts to this book and it should be file under  suburban housewives with first world problems  I found the beginning a tad boring  I almost gave up on it  good thing I didn t because I was rewarded with a good fun read Three women narrate the story  Rachel  Megan and Anna Let s break it down a bit Rachel is the sad pathetic drunk  She s no Henry Chinaski but still  nothing makes a better unreliable narrator in fiction than a drunk   she s lonely  depress  jobless who still takes the train into  work  because she has nothing better to do  A black out drunk who s miserable about her break up with Tom  a man who is now married and has a baby  she still calls him  and stalks his family  she s all kinds of weird this one Anna is the  bitch  of the bunch who stole Tom from Rachel  yeah very soap opera ish  the mistress has now become the housewife with a rugrat  She lives in Rachel s old house which she hates naturally  Rachel still bothers Tom which drives Anna crazy  Otherwise Anna is somewhat content with her little baby and a husband she loves dearly Megan is the beautiful blond  who is a liar and a cheat  married to the perfect man  However she s anxious  unhappy and wishes to run away from her life  She cheats on her husband  constantly lies about her past or where she s been  Then she goes missing This is the book s big mystery What happened to Megan  Who did what to whom  Clues are dropped and peppered all over these characters  at one point or another you ll suspect this one  that one or the other  The touches of Hitchcockian psychological thrills  is what makes the book a page turner  hence the reason why this book has become Amazon s bestseller of the year  Author Paula Hawkins knocked it out of the park with this one I was left with one question though  Who s the red headed dude  I was given two books to read  The Girl on the Train and another book  Two people told me to read the other book first because they liked it better than this one  so I did  I loved the other book  And then I started reading The Girl on the Train and I couldn t put it down  I liked the anonymity of Rachel  the main character  sitting on the train  the train she took everyday  looking out the window and imagining the life of a couple that she often saw on her journey on the train  I never would have dreamed of the story that author  Paula Hawkins  conjured up from such a simple act  sitting on a commuter train imagining a life of a couple one just happens to see while sitting on the train  What a compelling story  Wow  this one kept me wondering until the very end  What happens when the last person to see a killer and his victim is so drunk that she can t remember what happened  Well  you ll have to read to find out  Told from the perspectives of the victim  the witness  and another woman  it highlights how painful and horrible alcoholism is  and how manipulators use brokenness in others to get what they want  The pace is different from your average thriller but a great mystery story nonetheless  This has garnered many a comparison to Gone Girl  but personally I thought this was a whole lot better  Rachel is a great character  she s so real because she s so flawed and this makes her completely relatable  It s easy to see how she has ended up in the position she s in  an unemployed functioning alcoholic who resents her ex husband for moving his new wife into her old house  and when she latches on to the mystery surrounding a missing girl  it provides her an opportunity to have something to focus on  There s so much to say about this book  yet I don t want to spoil anything as it s tightly plotted and each new revelation that comes to light throws more doubt upon what actually happened  and I loved that   it kept me guessing throughout  and even though I was adamant I knew who the baddie was  and I was right  woo   I wasn t sure  how  it had happened    I know that s a bit vague  but suffice to say   read this now  You won t be sorry  and I m looking forward to the film adaptation   This story had from the beginning  I loved the fast paced plot  along with the twists   turns provided While some compare it to Gone Girl  I would not do the comparison  To be honest  I thought this book was better than Gone Girl  While I pretty much disliked every character in Gone Girl  I actually liked the characters in this book The main character had flaws  which is a great thing to have in a story  as people in general have flaws  are not perfect  With those flaws  she was still a likable character  She didn t mean harm when she did stupid things but was acting from raw emotions  The new wife was a little less likable but still had good traits  I could go on and on regarding the characters but do not want to give anything away While I figured out what happened to the woman that died  it took me awhile  which I greatly appreciate with any mystery thriller  There were some awesome little twists and turns that kept my attention throughout  I seriously could never fully walk away from the story   and always wanted to keep reading it  Unfortunately  work or everyday life stuff would creep in at times    The approach that was taken  as far as how the main character got involved in the murder investigation was very creative  It is something that I have not seen before I can t say enough good things about the book Definitely recommend  A slow starter with an explosive finish I was unlikely to pick this book up   but I really liked watching The Gone Girl  Gone Girl   and all promos for this book compared these two  An hour in  about 4 5 chapters down   I wasn t sure what I got into  The author seems keen on telling the story of a mopey divorced woman  with a little bit of whodunnit murder mystery wrapped around it  As the story progressed  the book picked up the pace and hit the right notes to tell a gripping story  Rachel Watson s protagonist is such a strong and interesting character  I really liked how Anna Watson grew into uncovering the big secret in the end  If possible  I d have ranked this book 4 5 stars for not handling the fringe characters very well  and specially showing how dumb and clueless the detectives were all the time  I guess that is forgivable since the book is written as a POV narrative Overall  a great read if you like thrillers  Great book  Hated the ending  5 Stars from me What a great debut thriller  The Girl On The Train is seven shades of awesome I very quickly found myself drawn into the story and into feelings of empathy and support for  the girl on the train   What a mess she s made of things lately  bless her I absolutely loved this book  loved the way things unravelled   mostly with me cringing as the poor girl seemed to dig herself deeper and deeper into embarrassing and unbelievable situations This book is people watching to the nth degree with a heap of loneliness and desperation sprinkled on top of a classic crime thriller A great read and a really fast read  almost impossible to put down as it flicks between characters meaning you have to keep reading in order to find out what happens next Highly recommended  I rarely read thrillers  but DANG  maybe I should read them more  I loved how the reader was left to piece the puzzle together  Once I hit the half way mark  I was hooked  I literally could not  put  it  down  What a crazy ride  And an even crazier ending  A debut psychological thriller that will forever change the way you look at other people s lives Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning  Every day she rattles down the track  flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes  and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck  She s even started to feel like she knows them   Jess and Jason   she calls them  Their life  as she sees it  is perfect  Not unlike the life she recently lost And then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough  Now everything s changed  Unable to keep it to herself  Rachel offers what she knows to the police  and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next  as well as in the lives of everyone involved  Has she done more harm than good Compulsively readable  The Girl on the Train is an emotionally immersive  Hitchcockian thriller and an electrifying debut  Oh wow  what an awesome book this was  I can t believe it s a debut novel  Not that I haven t read good debut novels before  but this one really knocked my socks off  The novel alternates between the perspectives of three different women  I can t say that the characters were all that likeable  but I m pretty sure they weren t supposed to be  I liked Rachel the most  but she frequently made me cringe with her embarrassingly bad decisions  I really felt more sorry for her than anything else  I guess  Megan was just incredibly messed up  and Anna   well  I pretty much couldn t stand Anna  However  Hawkins seems to be a master at making you care about characters that are deeply flawed  In fact  maybe that s a part of what made this book so interesting  The characters are so messed up  you can t help but wonder what they will do next  It was akin to watching the Jerry Springer show or rubbernecking at an accident scene  Completely voyeuristic  but very enjoyable  I know most people aren t going to believe me about this  but I saw the twist coming before the reveal  I think it s only because I had insomnia one night and couldn t help but think about the book  I can t say what tipped me off because I don t want to give anything away  but when you re lying in bed for an hour or more  unable to sleep  there s time to scrutinize a lot of things and some stuff just wasn t adding up  That s all I m going to say about that  The writing was done very well  the plot moved quickly  and I didn t notice any holes in it  I really just feel like this book was a literary masterpiece  I can t gush about it enough  Obviously  I m giving this one five stars  I d give it a higher rating if I could  If you haven t read this book  you really should as soon as possible  I listened to the audio book and I was really impressed  so I highly suggest reading listening to it on audio  The narrators were amazing and they just brought it to life  5 stars This review was originally posted on Bookworm Book Reviews wow  Elizabeth is missing  meets Gone Girl  enthralling  captivating and lovingly written  an amazing thriller that will win your heart I finished it at 2 a m  Need I say more  Probably not  but I will anyway  I haven t digested this yet  the 2 a m  was eight hours ago   I m better right now at why I didn t hate it  First  I don t know how the author did it  but I was not nearly as annoyed with Rachel as I normally am with self destructive characters  Yes  a couple of times I thought   please  PLEASE do not pick up that drink   but it didn t prevent my enjoyment of the novel Second  I see my Goodreads friend CLM thought it was predictable  I didn t find it predictable  Sometimes I m onto things early  but other times  now  evidently  I m a mystery thriller writer s best reader   just dim enough to not figure things out  Third  the writing was not awful  In fact  I found it crisp and interesting  Fourth  I haven t figured out which of the loose ends weren t tied up  and what parts of the plot don t make sense  Maybe I will after I ve had more than four and a half hours of continuous sleep  and perhaps I ll come knock off a star  But as of now  I think it was tied up  all right and tight   as an old Brit might say Fifth  somehow I didn t find it irredeemably dark  As with Rachel s character  I am not sure why not  when it s the sort of novel that would normally depress me  I would have to think about it or go back and read  but the author kept me sympathetic and interested without my getting too morose  OMFG  I can t believe I ve finally read it  I wait so much time to have it in my bare hands I litteraly wait months until it came to Uruguay and I finally bought it  This book kept me awake a whole nigth  Rachel is one of the best main characters Ive ever read of  She s an alcoholic unemployed person but she s clever and she always think the best of people even if she doesn t know them  She s always thinking about people and their actions  Her imagination is amazing  she invents a whole story to a couple she observe through the train window evri morning and evening  she named them  Jason and Jess  she invented to them jobs  age  how they met  everithig So when she observed something strange one morning she realizes that Jason and Jess weren t than happy as she thought they were She get s involved with a crime and different troubles with her ex husband ITS REALLY AMAZING  THERE WAS MOMENTS I COULDN T READ FAST ENOUGHHighly recommended      Warning  this novel is addictive and will keep you up at night     This was a super fun read  Dark and twisted  Just when you think you have it figured out  you find out you didn t  Quick read because you can t put it down  I ve heard people make comparisons to Gone Girl  I hated Gone Girl and loved this story  I picked this book up at a store a few weeks before I actually bought it  but I only read a few pages  I put the book back thinking it was a sad story about a woman obsessed and fixated on her past  The depression seemed too much for actual enjoyment  I m so happy that I gave this book a second chance  Don t give up after a few pages like I initially did  Stay with this girl on the train  You will not regret the ride  I always like a good  juicy  unreliable narrator  Or two  I could hardly put this book down once I started to read it  I wanted to know what happened next  As another reader noted  the story is fairly sad from beginning to end  and none of the characters are extremely likable  though by the end I felt a little better about Rachel  The unsavory characters just added to the bleak tone of the book  at any rate  it wasn t a bad element  in my opinion  I tore through this book in three days  Having just read a rather biting review of this book that states this book is for people who don t read  I would add that I am an avid reader of all sorts of books  I am also a writer  We all have our own opinions  this review is merely mine   Okay  so others may not think this should get five stars  but I listened to it rather than read it and the suspense probably added to my running speed  because I became so involved with the plot  The actress who reads this is very believable as the main character   a great choice of reader  I found the protagonist s lack of self control believable and sympathetic  Also  I did not guess the ending for most of the book  which is a big plus in mysteries   This is dark  And it s depressing  And it s really creepy  The characters all have almost unfathomable problems that make your heart break  But once you start reading Paula Hawkins s  The Girl on the Train   all you will want to do is read  This chilling book  combination psychological thriller and who done it  tells the story of three women and two men living in the London suburbs and the love  lies and jealousies that break them  Each chapter is told from the first person point of view of one of the women  The writing is riveting and the plot compelling  and even when you guess  who done it   there are more twists and turns to come  Advice  Take it to the beach or save it for a snow day when you can just give in and read for hours at a time  It s THAT good  Loved all the twisted characters  The book kept me interested  I really enjoyed it   Oh my goodness this book was so juicy  Of course it fits my  perfect book  characteristics  takes place in Great Britain  suspenseful  well written  I listened to this book and the narrators  3  lulled me into a auditory bliss  I also know a book is good when I don t just listen on my commute in the car but make excuses to go for a walk or listen while I cook dinner  The reason I chose this book is that I heard a review that this novel was the next  Gone Girl   I seem to be getting through my audio books much faster than my print books these days The story takes place in the suburbs of London  A sad  lonely  alcoholic woman  Rachel  who rides the train every day  passes her old home and fantasizes about her old life  husband left her for Anna and they live in the house she once shared with her ex  Tom  and about the life of a couple she does not know  but fantasizes about  a few doors down  She even gives them names   Jess  and  Jason   One morning  Rachel sees  Jess  do something awful from her vantage point on the train and then finds out that she is missing  Rachel becomes entwined in the mystery and things get VERY interesting and suspenseful  Some might say this would be an easy mystery to figure out  Now that I look back on it  I can see how  However  I usually don t try to figure out mysteries when I am reading them  I just enjoy the ride     I found the character development to be outstanding  I had such a clear vision of each one in my mind  Having been jilted in a marriage once myself  I could see why Rachel felt the way she did and how she went down such slippery slope This book is really worth reading if you enjoyed any of Gillian Flynn s books  it s similar in some ways  yet very unique in others  Definitely not quite as dark or  disturbing   though   What a page turner  no wonder this is the  1 NY Times Bestseller  This quick read is told from a few perspectives and goes back and forth over a period of time  The main narrator is unreliable  since she is a heavy drinker and imagines lives for people she sees from the train she takes daily  Really fun  I couldn t put it down  THIS BOOK IS JUST AMAZING  I gave it 5 stars because it became one of my favourite books  its perfect  Full of suspense and totally unexpected  I trully recommend itAND I WANT TO READ MORE OF THIS TYPE OF BOOKS   I WANT TO READ MORE FROM THIS AMAZING AUTHOR     Wow  This book was really  really good  A very quick read  very compelling characters  and I m a sucker for the  plot unravels in the present while we see the build up in the past as well  type narrative  The climax of the story is incredibly tense and gripping  I was literally biting my pen I was so anxious and exited If you want a quick read with a strong  uncomplicated and pleasant writing style  very well structured narrative  interesting flawed characters  a great first person present tense with a likable voice and a gripping mystery  I recommend this   Could not put it down   WOW  Fast paced  very entertaining  Twisted  I loved it    Hitchcockian is right  Paula Hawkins debut novel is worth the time  It was not at all what I d expected  and that alone kept me reading  At the halfway mark I found myself saying  This book has me all screwed up  And I cannot put it down   I had to find out why  and who  Now  be warned  there are a couple of spoilers in this review  although I do not give the end away  I m not that kind of person   Told primarily by Rachel  who isn t always a reliable narrator  we see how these people s lives are intertwined  Rachel may be crazy  you think  The others who tell their sides  Anna and Megan  may be as well  A bit of the literary criticism that was pounded into my head in college popped up as I read this  so I will share it with you  even though I normally just read a story for the story  Rachel rides the train every day  back   forth to a job she no longer has  looking out the window at the house she lived in with her ex husband  who now lives there with his new wife   baby  She s got a drinking problem  and has become a bit obsessed with the couple who live in the house a few doors down from her old house  the couple she calls Jess   Jason  Rachel is  in the beginning of the book  on a journey to nowhere  As her story unfolds  and she gets involved in things outside the train windows  we see that she is finally moving forward  The train is a symbol of her journey  This novel has been compared to Gone Girl  and a couple of other things I ve not read  but the comparison to Hitchcock is spot on  Read it  You ll like it  Oh  and another thing  I had not figured out who or why by the time it was revealed  and that  as you may know is always a plus in any mystery for me   Train ride or train wreck For me  this is a new genre of mystery thrillers  along the lines of Gone Girl  I like it  The characters are well developed  although I never did really understand what Megan s problem was  Was she bipolar  Narcissistic  In any case Rachel certainly was a tragedy  but in the end she redeemed herself  which I applaud  Like a train  this book chugged steadily along gathering speed at times and screeching to a stop at others  I couldn t put it down  There was just too much to discover and the desire to find out what happens next  undeniable   Friday July 5  2013 In my head I can still see that little pile of clothes lying at the edge of the track  abandoned  That s one of Rachel s observations from the train as she rides pass the neighborhood she use to live in before her husband cheated on her and then married his mistress  Her life s gone downhill ever since  That s how the story begins  Written in first person form three differ women  The girl on the train  Rachel  her husband s new wife  Anna  and a dead woman recently found dead  who lived in the same neighborhood  Megan  Their lives are connected    more so than we first realize  More so than they realize  I don t want to give anything away but everyone sees things differently while riding on a train  and in our own lives   in our relationships with our spouses or lovers  Sometimes seeing things differently    not seeing people as they really are    can be dangerous  You might find out what a person is really like    to late to save yourself  Or you might figure them out just in time to save yourself  Toward the end I guessed who did it but I couldn t guess what happened next  The Girl On the Train is charged full of electrifying suspense  It s wonderfully written with a twist at every turn  I consider it a must read  It s that good  Great psychological thriller  I couldn t put it down  If I were to compare it to gone girl  I still like gone girl more  but this one is great if your in the mood for something similar  I figured out what happened around page 228  which for a book that s around 300 pages  isnt so bad  I didn t expect it for most of the book  Great read   Rachel has become so fascinated with the couple whose house she passes while she s on the commuter train that she s even named them  She often sees them nuzzling on the terrace and compares it to her life  to her recent divorce  her old house is just a few doors away from their s  and alcoholism  One day Rachel sees  Jess  kissing someone else and soon after the woman goes missing  Rachel has information for the police but they deem her unreliable as she has suffered a blackout the day the woman disappears  As Rachel tries to piece together what happened that night  she gets deeper into the dangerous mystery  The excitement never stops with this thrilling mystery and the ending is great  Highly recommended  I didn t know about the book or the author  I went to the book shop and I just bought it judging the book from the cover  I have to say I really enjoyed it  wonderful story and very well detailed   recommend it  A very well executed book  I read the Indonesian version which I was not that eager to read at the beginning     I lost my interest after 5 pages but decided to move on  I am excited that I did that Rachel is a drunks  She started it long before her marriage is over  It was not that bad before  from her point of view but got worse when her pregnancy program failed  Her marriage is over for Tom could not handle her drinking habits and what came after that  He cheated their marriage when he met Anna  Rachel then moved from the house and Anna lived there  with Tom and their baby girl  in a house next to the railroad Pretending to still have her job  she was fired because she was drunk at work and made her company lost some money   Rachel went to work every morning and back late in the afternoon in the same train  She always looked at the houses near the railroad  especially ones closed to her old house                   What would you do when you arrived at home filthy and blood on you but did not remember a thing Rachel went on with her life despite the terrible wound on her head because she did not remember a thing from last night  the same night Megan  a beautiful wife who lived closed to her old house  was found dead  Stunningly creepy and compelling domestic thriller  A scary reminder that you never do know what s going on in the lives of your nearest and dearest   although these people s secrets really are above and beyond most  I hope      The book twists and turns all the way to an ending that left me gasping  Really top notch stuff  This book kept me guessing At first I thought the girl in the train was a spirit  haunting her former life from the tracks and keeping her regular routine in tact  instead  the several perspectives of the characters showed that she was real  The pieces came together at the end with satisfying closure to a tawdry tale of sadness underlining the ease with which a person can use and abuse another human for selfish needs  Ann Landers used to write that one can not be taken advantage of without giving permission  sometimes it takes strength to recognize another s absolute disregard for anyone else  I can t wait to watch the movie   Loved it Fascinating and creepy   Loved it  Better than Gone Girl Do I need to expand on that  OK then   This was the sort of book that had me brushing the kids off and forgetting to feed them because I couldn t bear to put it down  That doesn t really make me a bad mother  though  I finished it in an afternoon  I really couldn t put it down Every day on her commute to London  Rachel looks out for the same house  to see what the inhabitants are up to  She doesn t know them  but has given them names and back stories  and craves the daily update she imagines for them as the train makes its regular halt at the signals at the end of their garden  But Rachel isn t really going to work every day  and she s got more history involved in her mystery couple than she lets on  The story is told from three perspectives  those of Rachel herself  Megan   the woman in the house   and Anna  who lives a few doors away  and is the new wife  once mistress  of Rachel s ex husband  Then Megan disappears  and Rachel can t stop herself from becoming involved It wasn t just the plot that kept me reading  excellent though that was  Hawkins does not put a foot wrong  whether it s in the changing voices  the atmosphere and setting  or the characters themselves  main or subsidiary  There are no slips  no careless moments to jerk the reader out of the complete suspension of disbelief that is the hallmark of a really good read The only minor quibble relates to reading it on my Nook  I didn t realise until a good few chapters in that the dates weren t moving day by day  so I lost track a bit of when the  Megan  chapters were happening  It s just not as easy to flip back and check electronically  Loved it  Can t wait for the movie  Spellbinding and I loved the English setting  Thanks mom and dad  My Rating  5 5This is Paula Hawkin s first novel  It debuted on January 13  2015 and is  as of this post  two weeks later   No  2 on USA TODAY s Best Selling Books list Synopsis Maybe it was then  Maybe that was the moment when things started to go wrong  the moment when I imagined us no longer a couple  but a family  and after that  once I had that picture in my head  just the two of us could never be enough  Through several different points of view and many twists and turns  The Girl on the Train encompasses a sinister plot  a deadly romance  and the darkness in a seemingly peaceful domestic life  Rachel  one of the main characters  is an obese  twenty eight year old who has been divorced for two years  yet still dreams of the married life she left behind  On her lonely train ride home each day  she passes a young couple  upon whom she paints an imaginary life of domestic bliss  But one evening  she sees something from the train window that sets her on a tangled and distraught path  She goes to the police with her story and becomes wrapped up in an investigation  But will she do more harm than good My Likes  It gives me a little frisson even now  walking past that house   butterflies suddenly swarm in my stomach  and a smile comes to my lips and colour to my cheeks  Writing Style  Hawkins  writing style is the best part of this book  It was very readable while also being complex enough to keep me entertained  As soon as I started reading it  I couldn t put it down  It demanded to be read  compelled me to keep going  sentence after sentence  until I found myself at the end  Yet still the novel was nicely paced and didn t seem rushed despite the continual forward movement Character  The characters in this novel were both real and relatable  Every character had a depth of personality and wasn t merely two dimensional  Not only that  the characters were so real that they left an impression and gave me insight into my own character  The imagination and precision that went into the characters in this novel was astounding   If the characters in my still in the works novel turned out half as good as these  I would be beyond happy   At night when I lie awake I can hear it  quiet but unrelenting  undeniable  a whisper in my head  Slip away  Suspense  I appreciated the ability of the author to create such a tangle of suspicion that it left me completely in doubt as to who the true criminal was   Although  I   typically  unless the novel is completely simple and sub par   tend to go along with the narrator in her quest for knowledge  This allows me to be just as surprised as she is  though it takes out the fun of pretending to be the detective   But in this particular novel  I was able to do both   though there are probably those more skilled or paranoid than I am who figured out the culprit  But I can gladly say that I was both surprised and intrigued by the ending Everyday Life  I like that this book took something incredibly simple and every day  a train ride home from the city  and used it to incorporate a complicated and sinister plot The author goes into some detail about ordinary life  the people Rachel seems from the train in their domestic environments  And it s touched on in such a way that it makes me feel as though  by not paying attention on my bus ride home  I m missing something tangible in life  I might miss an entire story by just reading a book or surfing through Facebook instead of staring out the window at the houses and people that pass by My Dislikes It s not until I get home that I realize I cut my hand when I fell  and at some point I must have rubbed my hand across my mouth  My lips are smeared with blood  Character Differences  Rachel and  Jess  do have some similar personality traits  vices  and expectations  yet they are also fundamentally different people  with different needs  values  and complications  Yet the two different points of view often seemed too similar in thought  and writing style  that  if I hadn t had the name at the beginning of the chapter to go by  I wouldn t have known which character was which    For instance  Rachel is incredibly needy and obsessive throughout the novel   Jess  on the other hand  seems to be more aloof and independent  but seems to slip into a neediness that mirrors Rachel s  without reason    It s a dream  I think  I keep trying to grasp at it  to hold on to it  but the harder I struggle  the fainter and the further away it gets  Introduction to  Jess  and  Jason   I felt as though the beginning introduction to Jess and Jason wasn t quite long enough for me to feel as acutely that sense of loss that Rachel experiences at the end of the novel  when her entire world has fallen over onto itself  I felt her disappointment  but I couldn t quite share it with her WarningsThis book has very mature themes and some graphic content  including both sexual and violent All in all  few dislikes  I adored this novel  I started reading it late into the evening  and literally could not put it down until I had finished it  which ended up being some four or five hours later in the early hours of the morning   I feel no shame  Haha  but seriously  this book  as most  if not all  of the previous book reviews have certainly mentioned  is definitely worth your time   Trust me  you won t need much time on this one  It s a fast and thrilling read   I was locked into the character s lives as resolutely as if they had been my close friends I hope you enjoy the book  and I d love to hear your thoughts on it if when you read it  Check out this review and many others at my blog  CreasedPage May your life have many creased pages  Manda I was originally going to rate this 4 stars due to some minor plot discrepancies  but my enjoyment while I read this was so great I can overlook minor flaws  Many people hate the 3 female protagonists in this book  I personally really enjoyed them all  Yeah  they re flawed  they have personal problems and struggles but they aren t perfect cookie cutter women which I so appreciate  They are each strong in their own right and stick to their convictions  As a mystery thriller novice I didn t see the twist or big reveal coming and was very taken aback which I enjoyed  The story starts off rather slowly  but once you get over the 50 page hump you start to see where Hawkins is going with this book  My only  minor  gripe is that there are two characters who play a rather large role in the first 3 4 of the book  yet they are abandoned for the last quarter and their stories are not wrapped up  Other than that this was an excellent read and I totally understand why the wait list at my library system currently stands at 371   Really enjoyed this read  Similar to  Gone Girl   as it keeps you wanting to read just to find out what really happened  I would highly recommend this book if you enjoyed  Gone Girl   I really enjoyed this book  It reminded me a lot of Gone Girl  Well written with prose that flows easily  The language is probably at the low end of four stars  it s good but not great  The language is probably the least well crafted part of this book  But it s not all about the language  is it No  this one has so much more going for it than that  There are the characters  told by three distinct women  each challenged by some very real character flaws and compelling pasts that are meted out  ever so perfectly throughout the novel  Nothing is revealed to soon  nor is it held out to the very end for the sudden  twist  ending  Then there is the pacing  wonderfully done  each page doling out its own revelations of character and plot  And the plot  Nothing that is groundbreaking  but it s pretty flawlessly  This is a mystery  and could you guess the whodunnit in advance of the reveal  Sure  you could  But like the greatest of mysteries  this one gives you all the information you need to start piecing it all together  and pretty bluntly  but it is never so heavy handed as to set off the lightbulb that makes you go  well  gee  that s obvious  This novel has suffered some comparisons to Gone Girl  and I say  suffered  because I view that one extremely unfavorably  it s final twist is indeed shocking  but only because it s completely ludicrous and unfairly achieved   and I can see where some of the comparisons arise from  The domestic arrangements are horrifyingly caustic  which is usually something I hate  I still read for the escape  see  and while I love conflict and struggle I want it to take place outside of the home  In Girl on The Train  I just didn t mind the emotional setting  It was too compelling  and the characters  far from being shallow and conniving  minus the one baddie who  as a murderer  needed to be conniving   were fully realized and their admirable attributes balanced realistically with their shameful ones The other comparison this draws is to Rear Window  While that is deserved due to the framework of main character  Rachel  as voyeur  this novel quickly departs from the small window view and thrusts our heroine into the action  So if you re fearful of encountering something detached from the action  fear not  There is plenty of movement and activity here In all  I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys mysteries  And also to anyone who enjoys character studies or domestic dramas or to anyone who just enjoys watching a complex drama come together piece by piece  If I ve given other books five stars  this one deserves ten  Despite the comparisons to Gone Girl  I would say The Girl on the Train more closely mirrors Big Little Lies by Liane Moriarty  one of my favorite books   What set this book apart for me was the pace  Instead of waiting for the action  I was hooked from very early on  16  in on my Kindle  Paula Hawkins does an expert job of keeping the reader riveted while casting suspicion on every character  making it impossible to know who to trust  Atmospheric  creepy  fast paced  beautifully written  It will be hard to find another book to top this one  Loved it   great twisty who done it  Excellent book  I couldn t put the book down  I read it in three days  A must read  What a great story  Crazy people  alcohol  forgotten memories  vengeful exes   trains  This book keeps you constantly guessing and on edge with suspense  Definitely recommend to anyone who loves drama spiced with a little bit of thrill   A great read with a  you can t really tell who did it  ending   Absolutely loved this book  Exciting debut novel and congratulations to Paula Hawkins  Three women each tell the story from their viewpoint and intertwine as the book goes on  We meet Rachel  Anna and Megan  I really liked the way my opinion of each character changed as the book went on  An intriguing plot line and suspense mostly generated by Rachel s story and her lack of memory about events  Megan goes missing and Rachel feels she knows the answers if only she could remember  Some people have commented that the ending is easy to guess  I don t think so and anyway why would you  There are only so many characters in the book so it stands to reason you ll know the character and the law of averages says someone will be right and there are only so many plots for an author to use  Instead  let the book take you on its journey and discover the delights of all being revealed at the end  This book is a cracker  well thought out plot and with interesting  well rounded characters  Buy it  read it and enjoy the ride Riveting  Great book  I couldn t put it down  The characters are all so different  I honesty didn t even know who to feel sorry for  Definitely an enjoyable read for readers who like twists and turns in their stories     Rachel is a washed up thirty something who creates a fantasy about the seemingly perfect couple she sees during her daily train ride into London  When the woman goes missing  Rachel manages to insert herself into the investigation of the woman s disappearance  In the vein of Gone Girl  this dark psychological thriller is fast paced and features some very unreliable narrators  Andrea Larson  Cook Memorial Public Library  Libertyville  IL This definitely scratched my Gone Girl itch  Very suspenseful  All 3 of these women are falling apart in the most reviling ways  I liked exploring and finding sympathy for them  connecting and finding similarities with myself or real women I know  I like that the author didn t look away when things got ugly and let you in on the characters most selfish and self destructive thoughts and choices  I don t know that I ve read women in popular fiction that were so unlikable but sympathetic  Felt very real  feminist  modern  Loved it  Let me just start by saying  wow   If you intend to start reading this book  make sure that you do so while you have nothing to do because you won t be able to put it down  You become so engulfed in the mystery that your mind keeps going through different theories that just make you want to read more  The writing is splendid and I love that you read through the point of view of the three girls  Each story is crazy on its own and it s mind blowing when they tie together at the end  You start guessing at the solution early on  but you ll never be sure and you might even be wrong at the end  I love that you grow to love Rachel despite also criticizing her for what she s doing  At some point in the book I stopped feeling bad for her because but then I realized the girl is traumatized  If I was in her shoes I would be too  If you liked Gone Girl you will love this book  Read it  Now I understand why is was something like  295 on the waiting list at the library  I decided to just buy it  Kindle  rather than wait  What a completely engrossing  satisfying story  The tale is told by 3 women   Rachel  Anna  Megan and involves a sad  lonely  heartbroken alcoholic woman  Rachel  who creates an entire fantasy life surrounding a couple she sees daily from the train window  It is only 4 doors down from her old house  now occupied by her ex husband and new wife  Anna   Megan is the character about whom Rachel fanaticizes and watches each day with her handsome  loving husband   the perfect couple  perfect life  Megan goes missing and things begin to really fall apart for Rachel who deals with her alcoholism and frequent blackouts  unemployment and her life full of lies and misery  She plops herself squarely in the middle of the mystery of the missing woman and it is fascinating how the story unfolds  each chapter revealing another juicy tidbit  I read it quickly  but wanted to savor every morsel of it at the same time  This I could read again   Great book  Kept me interested from the beginning  Each chapter revealed a different piece to the puzzle  Excellent read      A real page turner     In fact there were times I was afraid to turn the page     I was gifted this book on my birthday and I took me a while to start but this is one one those books that grows on you  I finished it in a couple of days and have concluded that Paula sure has some talent for writing a thriller The dark places of her mind  alcoholism and a human urge to get better of the situation  Rachael s struggle to make sense in her miserable life and her entangled affair with Jess and Jason and their supposed  perfect  relationship sounded mundane to me at first  but Paula s mesmerizing writing builds depth to the characters who you can relate to as real world people  their faults seem reasonable and every character has a role to play Loved it and would recommend it to every fellow reader   Ah  Ms  Hawkins    very clever  Ingenious  really  The tale of two women  at first   each told a year apart  I felt like I was traveling on the train  First with one  on a fast ride with destination and the other a slower ride  but still another destination that had already been foreshadowed  Yes  I did figure it out before the end  and have to admit there was a little too much of the therapists role  Could have been off putting if more were shared so kudos for keeping the balance  this was not an easy book to write so my hats off to you there  Compelling  intriguing and yes  I couldn t put it down  the best part was right up to the end it was suspenseful  Another hats off right there  Ah yes  the way the cork screwed  plot twisted  women and their revenge or assurances or whatever you want to label it as being  I think I ll label it survival  Audio readers  there are 3  were awesome  Great book  24 hours from start to finish    I couldn t put it down  Loved it but I m a sucker for a short chartered quick read with a crazy plot   This is such a fantastically gripping thriller  it s quite amazing to find that it is a debut  I loved the concept of where a fleeting commuter glance could lead   The speed blurred cover text is genius  by the way   The timeline cleverly switches back and forth between the events leading up to the crime  and Rachel s embroilment in its aftermath  and it kept me rapt  guessing wildly  until the very end  Yes  there are strong  shadowy strangers  long hidden grudges  fake niceties  unguarded flashes of malevolence    all the usual suspects a good thriller has to offer  But it is Rachel  our  Girl on the Train   who is the most fascinating  What we know for sure is that she s close to emotional collapse and alcohol dependent  She can t trust herself  and so neither can the reader  Is she the architect of her own unhappiness  Is she a victim  or a perpetrator  A fantasist  A voyeur  Is she strong  or is she weak  You ll commit to finding these answers  I guarantee it   The Girl on the Train  is one hell of a ride  and once on board  there s no stopping  til terminus  Enjoy your journey  I did  4 5 stars if I had the option http   www thewellreadredhead com 201    Wow  I couldn t put this one down  The Girl on the Train is an up all night  cannot put down thriller  The unreliable protagonist is named Rachel  a seeming sad sack alcoholic who is divorced and very unhappy  She rides the train daily into and out of London to her mindless job in public relations  While on the train  she passes the houses and fantasizes about the perfect lives lived within the walls  She is stuck on one in particular house and even names the loving couple Jess and Jason  One day  she sees Jess kissing someone on her terrace and Rachel is crushed to see that it s not Jason  She soon learns that  Jess  is  in fact  named Megan and she has disappeared  The police suspect the husband Scott  who Rachel secretly thinks of as Jason  Rachel soon loses her job over her alcoholism  but keeps up her schedule of riding the same trains back and forth to London to hide the embarrassing truth from her roommate and to stay connected to her drama of Megan and Scott  Rachel decides that she must insert herself into the drama of the missing wife because she feels that the information that she has from viewing that kiss from the passing train in critical in saving the husband  The other piece that we learn is that Rachel s ex husband  and his new wife and child live a few houses down from Megan and Scott and that this house was originally Rachel s  All of the lives become intertwined in interesting ways and suspicion shifts around constantly because the reader is never sure about the veracity of what anyone is saying  intentionally or unintentionally  Rachel  who blacks out when she is drunk  is constantly trying to piece together the ongoing story and trying to decipher reality from her imagination  It is a very exciting book and reminded me of the Hitchcock movie  Rear Window   I raced through this book and thought it was well written and well executed  Loved this book  Its deceptively simple style drags you right in  making you want to read on and on  While I cannot say that I was very surprised by the  whodunnit  in the end  it still was very cleverly done  with main protagonist Rachael being a very unreliable narrator  Despite her alcoholism and all the flaws that come with it  I liked her  and also the Co protagonists Megan and Anna  They all had something you could sympathize with  even if you didn t find them sympathetic  exactly  I personally love stories that are set in an environment that could be my own life  rather than serial killer scenarios  So this book is definitely up my alley and I can recommend it for a fast  feverish and engaging read   Would read the VERY NEXT THING this author wrote  Compelling read  Fast and twisty plot  Loved it  At first  I wasn t interested in reading this book  I read a review of it  and thought  that sounds pretty good  maybe I ll try it  Boy am I glad I did  This was an amazingly twisted story of a murder  told from the viewpoint of several different characters  with abusive relationships  alcoholism  and survival instinct all playing a role in the outcome  You really have to pay attention to the title of each chapter  as it tells you who is speaking and  more importantly  when  When the pieces start to fall into place  you can t put the book down because you want to find out how it ends   and what an ending it has  If you like psychological suspense and plot twists  this book is for you  You would be setting yourself up for disappointment if you actually believed that everyone you passed along the street lived a life full of laughter   happiness  Fact is  there are many people out there that are miserable  sad  grieving  addicts   reckless  This book is exactly that  Rachel is a young woman  an alcoholic actually  that cannot get over the fact that her husband Tom has left her for another woman  Anna  She s had to move to a neighboring city   takes the train to   from work every day  or at least that s what her roommate thinks  The truth is that Rachel hasn t only lost her marriage but also her job  since she doesn t know how to tell her roommate she just pretends she s still employed   makes that commute every day  Normally she begins to drink in the evenings  but sometimes she can t deal with her inner demons   starts drinking her gin   tonics during her early commute  On those days she gets so plastered she blacks out   barely has any recollection of what has happened  This proves to be a huge problem  Rachel has made it a habit to stare out of the train window during her commute   every day she sees this couple in the yard of their home  She gives them names   imagines what their lives must be like because she always sees them in good spirits  However  one morning she sees something completely different   it ruins the story she s made up in her head about this couple  Not being able to understand what has happened  she is pulled into their lives   unfortunately cannot pull herself away due to her own weird fascination for wanting to find out what s really going on This twisted  dark  psychological thriller completely consumed me  I found myself reading at red lights  during my breaks at work     any small window of time that permitted a few pages I took advantage of  I love how the story is told from different POV s   I also really like how it goes back   forth in time  To me these things specifically make the read go so much faster  If you re looking for a page turner   you like suspense I definitely recommend this read  Paula Hawkins absolutely delivered  The twists and turns  This is storytelling at its best  I highly recommend  That was a totally engrossing story  I like these kind of books  not necessarily of the crime mystery genre  where there are clues throughout the story  key words that the reader can pick up either early on or in retrospect  that give the culprit away  It feels like a scavenger hunt  or a playful wink from the author  I managed to pick up in those clues and identify the murderer Paula Hawkins tried very hard to throw me off  and it almost worked  but I was adamant  The story unfolds in a diary format sort of  of three women  Rachel  the main protagonist  who numbs the pain of a bad marriage and failed dreams with alcohol  Anna the other woman  the new wife  and Megan  Anna s neighbor who goes missing  It is only fitting that the story is told from the point of view of these women  Telling you exactly why would give too much away  So each characters get their turn to narrate 2 3 days of the present time  although Anna is not introduced in the beginning   There is no big leap from a period to the next  only Megan s  diary  is set from a year earlier  but get back to the present time as the story goes  This book has been compared to Gone girl  But in reality what both books have in common is the genre   An excellent read  One of those rare books that had me thinking about them during the day and being anxious to get back to them in the evening  Listened to this on Audible  Good audio read for sure   This is definitely the best book I ve ever read  I never wanted to put it down   Thought I d like this book  it ticked all the boxes  based in London suburbia  crime fiction  not too long  And yep  sure did  Not that the characters are that loveable  in fact pretty loathsome really  But really liked the writing style and pacing in fact struggled to put it down  It ll make a good film  I didn t expect to spend such a huge chunk of the weekend reading this but I truly could not set it down  A lot of people are comparing it to  Gone Girl   and I suppose there are some similarities  but Hawkins takes the idea of an unreliable narrator much further and also perfectly describes a woman foundering on the rocks of alcoholism and depression  You really have to pay attention to the timeline switches but the plot unfolds so well  I really enjoyed this one but it hurt my heart as well  all three of the women whose stories are told are in places in their lives where the past is dragging them backwards  IntenseIntense as an electric arc  a difficult but well drawn story  Honest and deeply pathetic  A heavy sigh upon ending   It is a real thriller  Hard to put down  I DID AN   ALL NIGHTER  ON THIS ONE  TERRIFIC  THIS AUTHOR MADE ME FEEL ANTICIPATION ON EVER PAGE TO THE POINT I DID NOT PUT IT DOWN TILL I HAD FINISHED READING IT  A COMMUTER TRAIN AND 3 LIVES THAT S IT  BUT  WOW  CAN THE AUTHOR  PAULA HAWKINS  WRITE  I LISTENED TO A STORY ON NPR ABOUT IT AND BOUGHT IT IMMEDIATELY  I HAD NEVER HEARD OF HER  I THINK  FROM NPR  PROBABLY NOT TO MANY OTHERS HAD EITHER UNTIL THE TRAIN CAME ALONG   OH  BY THE WAY  IF ONE HAS BEEN READING CHIT CHAT ON REVIEWS REGARDING COMPARISONS  I READ  GONE GIRL   AND I HATED IT    I really enjoyed this book  At first I was going to rate it 4 stars because I could not get over my frustration at the main character s alcoholism  Just stop drinking  I kept screaming it at the book and her persistence was infuriating  but after I finished the book I realized that Rachel s drinking is a key piece of the story and that all those bad things had to happen before she quit  This book definitely kept me on my toes  I must admit I guess about halfway through who the bad guy was but I still wasn t disappointed to find that I was right  The author gave an interesting perspective of three very crucial female characters  I love that it was through their eyes and not their male counterparts  Women can be vicious but at the same time incredibly resilient  I found myself being angry at all three women several times but just as they grew to understand one another  at least Rachel and Anna did  I also began to understand them a little more and I gained patience towards them  Overall  I thought the storyline was unique  the characters vivid  and the circumstances real enough to be believable and outlandish enough to keep the reading suspenseful  Echt een boek dat je niet aan de kant kan leggen  About twenty pages into this novel I thought  oh damn  another unreliable narrator  I kept reading because Rachel is such a compelling  realistic character   I m a fan of  unlikable  characters  I find them interesting   Parts of the plot weren t too hard to unravel  but I had to keep reading  at a breakneck speed  to find out what happened to Rachel  Great suspense  great settings  great characters  great read  I read this in two days  Simply couldn t put it down  Very well written from the first page  Rachel was an engrossing character  Damaged and broken and because of her unreliability in what was real or unreal  due to her drinking  she was the perfect character for this plot  This novel was so well written and took this reader along for an enjoyable ride with all the twists and turns  The writing wasn t overly descriptive but certainly enough that I felt like  I  was sitting on that train right next to Rachel Personally  I thought it was way better than Gone Girl        I loved Gone Girl ALL the way through until the ending when I shook my head and said  what   Not so with this story  Realistic and satisfying ending that doesn t leave the reader shaking their head in confusion  My only concern is now finding another book to keep me as engrossed as this one did  I highly recommend it  This was very exciting  For the last 40 pages or so I couldn t put it down  Highly recommend  I loved this creepy  uncomfortable book all the way through  My skin was crawling in many parts in the best way possible  These characters are all so well developed  and the plot is incredibly twisted and thick with thrills  It s a good Gone Girl esque psychological thriller  maybe a little faster paced but just as readable  The narrator was so unreliable  but I did start rooting for her  I could relate to her desperation in some ways  In fact  I think I could relate to all of these characters in one way or another  despite the fact that I didn t really like many of them     I couldn t put this book down until I knew who done it  and it was a satisfying finish  5 stars   A compelling psychological thriller  set up so that every main character was under deep suspicion at some stage  Really clever without a hint of smugness  a cracking good read  Despite many of the most recent comments  I genuinely enjoyed this book from start to finish  It is really hard to weave an engaging thriller mystery story and until now  I was beginning to give up on the genre  The Girl on the Train read like a story told on Dateline  but I still would recommend it  Admittedly  there are some truly trying personas to get on board with  but I felt they were just believable enough to be possible  We all know that one compulsive liar or that one person obsessed with the drama of other s lives  The ending  though anticlimactic to some and maybe even expected  was quite honestly pretty fitting for the tale  After reading through a suspenseful thriller most any  happy  ending will seem to fall flat  If you understand that this mystery is meant to be solved  then there are high hopes for you to enjoy the book   Intrigante  rapido  confuso  enganador  agobiante  claustrofobico y tremendamente adictivo  Tome este libro sin mayores expectativas  sus primeras 50 paginas no me conducian a ningun lado  pero de un momento a otro el libro tomo vida  cogio forma y no me solto  En sus ultimas 100 paginas mi corazon estaba a reventar  latia tan fuerte como el de la misma Rachel  debo confesar que me tomo por sorpresa     no  no lo vi venir  cosa que me gusto demasiado porque yo tenia un una candidato a diferente al del final  asi que quede como  ohhhh   La historia me gusto muchisimo  Muy  pero muy buen libro  Every morning  Rachel gets up and catches the 8 04 commuter train from Ashbury to London  Every day  about halfway through the journey it stops at a signal in Witney  sometimes for a few seconds  sometimes for a few minutes  While sitting their waiting  Rachel can see into the houses that back onto the line  She watches the people inside  having breakfast  getting ready to leave and she imagines lives for them  assigning them them names and careers  Her favourites are Jess and Jason  Jess  a beautiful blonde  Rachel has decided works in the fashion industry and is an artist  Her handsome husband Jason is a doctor  whose frequent absences Rachel attributes to a doctor who specialises in foreign aid  Jess and Jason are very much in love and remind Rachel of her true love  Tom  and the blissfully happy times they spent together  In the evening  Rachel takes the 17 56 home and she checks in on the Witney residents  These events structure her day and  I suspect  her life  The interest Rachel has in Witney is intense  Her day is structured around those two stops and her surveillance is constant and odd  While reading  I started to ask myself why does she care so much  why is she so invested in other people s lives  As we start learn more about Rachel  we find out she was happy and now she is not  Something happened  something big  that resulted in her happy loving marriage ending and Racel lodging with a university friend Cathy  a woman she describes as  a nice person  in a forceful sort of way She makes you notice her niceness  Her niceness is writ large  it is her defining quality and she needs it acknowledged  often  daily almost  which can be tiring   Something bad has happened for Rachel to be in the place where she is  and the spectre of this bad thing hangs over the opening chapters of this novel  building tension and setting up Rachel as one of my favourite literary figures   the unreliable narrator One morning  Rachel is shocked to see Jess kissing another man  betraying Jason  who Rachel has decided is the perfect husband  The next day  she is shocked to see Jess s face plastered all over the news  Her name is actually Megan she has gone missing  Her husband is not Jason but Scott  who works in IT and is prime suspect number one  Rachel is convinced he is innocent and has decided she must tell him and the police that Rachel was unfaithful  but can she leave the isolated half life she s been living in order to do this  Is she able to take the step from being the girl on the train to being involved in a real life missing person s case I really enjoyed this book  The tension at the centre of the tale is established early and effectively and grows steadily throughout the book as the story is told by different characters  including Megan  Comparisons have been made between The Girl on the Train and Gone Girl  They are both tense psychological thrillers but they are different in that The Girl on the Train is less dark than Gone Girl and the characters will be much less polarising  I think if you liked Gone Girl you will probably like this but also the audience for The Girl on the Train will find the book less polarising A cracking read that I finished in an afternoon  Five stars  Woah  Brilliantly deceptive  I do have a soft spot for the unreliable narrator  This might be better than Gone Girl  Review to come  Reese     when will the movie hit the theaters  Girl on a Train by Paula HawkinsPG13 for language and sexual situationsThe Book  Rachel considers herself worthless and turns to the bottle  She loses her job but continues to ride the commuter train twice a day to trick her landlady  She passes the home of her ex husband Tom and his new wife Anna Because of a signal malfunction she often finds her trail stopped on the tracks next to her former home  She notices another couple  She refers to them as Jess and Jason and manufactures a narrative about their lives When Megan  real name of Jess  disappears Rachel finds herself in the police investigation  She was stalking the neighborhood the night of the disappearance  Because she drinks to a point where she has blackouts she has only sketchy memory of the night and unexplained wounds on her body  The book is in three first person voices  Rachel  Megan and Anna My Thoughts  I know why this book has been on the New York s Best Selling list for the past few months  It s good and easy to follow with the different dates and times at each section  This is a raw look at the world of alcohol and human carnage  There were surprises all the way until the end  This book has a powerful messages The take away People lie to themselves and others   Value Truth Men and women expect different things out of a relationship   Value Insight Sex outside marriage damages relationships   Value Marriage  Told in the same vein as Gone Girl with alternating points of view  The author does a great job of keeping you guessing as to who perpetuated the ultimate crime and it doesn t help when the main character drinks to the point of blacking out and is stalking her now remarried ex husband because she can t emotionally let him go  And then  a woman pops up dead on the same street he lives on  and she s been there  but can t remember  Even has a night where she comes home injured   but can t remember  Really enjoyed this novel  Highly recommended  Will definitely read the next book by this author   Review to come LOVED this book  could not put it down  and stayed up way too late a few nights reading it  I would actually give this a 4 5 if that were an option  The only down side to this book is that I knew I was being manipulated  but the writing was so good that I didn t mind  Shades of Gone Girl  Very well done debut novel by Paula Hawkins  She does an excellent job of portraying the disease of alcoholism and how it ravages the main character as she tries to cope and remember the things she saw  She tries to figure out the mystery but no one will trust her or believe her   she is considered an  unreliable witness  because of her alcoholism  But she is a strong character   very well developed  This book does have a Hitchcockian feel to it too and clues are doled out in each chapter  The book switches narrators with each chapter so you can follow the story from different viewpoints  Each character is well written and has a different personality in how the book is written  I liked the book very much  This one really kept me on the edge of my seat  I love the way Hawkins gradually reveals key information along the way while at the same time brilliantly developing her characters  The writing was good too  stark  taut  clear  and sometimes beautiful  During the busiest time of the season for me  I finished reading this one in only three days because it was that good  I couldn t put it down  The Girl on the Train was everything Flynn s Gone Girl should have been  WOW     Absolutely mesmerizing  It was hard to put down  I highly  highly recommend to anyone looking for a fast paced mystery thriller   This book is so creepy  make your skin crawl good  Goes on my Must Read shelf  Ich habe das Buch im englischen Original gelesen  daher kann ich nichts zur deutschen Ubersetzung sagen  Nachdem das Buch momentan ja in aller Munde ist  musste ich selbst herausfinden  was hinter diesem Hype steckt  Der Klappentext klang vielversprechend  auch wenn ich mir noch nicht sicher war  was mich erwarten wird  aber das finde ich auch gut so  Nach Beendigung der Leseprobe war sofort klar  dass ich das Buch auf der Stelle weiterlesen muss  Stilistisch hat mir das Buch sehr gut gefallen  Obwohl es sich um einen Thriller handelt  meiner Meinung nach ein sehr guter Psychothriller  verspruhte die Erzahlweise eine gewisse Ruhe  Fur mich stand dies fur die Ruhe oder Stille  die Rachel im Zug empfand  vielleicht aber auch fur ihre Einsamkeit  Ich konnte sehr gut nachempfinden  wie sie sich fuhlt  was sie denkt  was in ihr vorgeht  Meiner Meinung nach wurde sie als Charakter sehr gut dargestellt  Die anderen Charakter kennt man nicht so gut kennen wie Rachel  aber das fand ich auch in Ordnung und hat zur Geschichte gepasst  Das einzige  was mich etwas gestort hat  ist dass das Buch im letzten Drittel fur mich etwas langatmig wurde  Ich habe das Buch gerne gelesen  es hat mir sehr gut gefallen  aber es war nicht schwer  es auch mal fur ein paar Tage aus der Hand zu legen  Das Ende war fur mich schon uberraschend  Ich habe sehr lange etwas ganz anderes vermutet  Erst relativ kurz vor dem Ende habe ich langsam geahnt  was hier tatsachlich passiert ist  Ich habe das Buch sehr gerne gelesen  Es handelt sich um einen Psychothriller  der jedenfalls Einblick in die Psyche von Rachel gibt  Abgesehen von einigen Langen hat mir das Buch sehr gut gefallen   I could not put this book down  Written in the style of Gone Girl  but with the page turning suspense of The Husband s Secret  this book kept me captivated for two straight days  I couldn t get anything done while reading this book  The character development and insight into their demons was phenomenal  Although most of the characters were hard to love   I couldn t prevent myself from becoming wrapped up in their lives  I had figured out the ending before it came  but the plot took me through many twists and turns up to that point  I may be one of the few people out there who absolutely hated  Gone Girl   Between the slow paced start to the completely unreliable narrators  I just could not sink myself into that best seller  So I was cautious to buy this   and boy was I wrong  The Girl on the Train  was everything I had heard  and hoped   Gone Girl  would be  Thrilling  Captivating  Twisty  Creepy  Brilliant writing surrounding an even better story  The fact that the narrator can t remember things  not really a spoiler at all  she has a pretty apparent drinking problem from page 1  gives it that edge of mystery without forcing the narrator to lie to you  which is fantastic  I loved the changing viewpoints between the characters  I loved that the three viewpoints you got were ALL female and all slightly damaged in some way  No Mary Sue characters in this setting  each woman is hiding something bitter and cold and terrible about their persona  alcoholism  cheaters  liars  immorality  etc   The twist felt REAL  not contrived  You spend the entire read trying to figure out  whodunnit   making  The Girl on the Train  a fantastic page turner The one other thing that really got me  I ride the train everyday  Between people walking by outside and people on the train  you can t help but find yourself staring  Watching  Contemplating  Who is that person  What is there life like  That s the EXACT question this asks  it takes such a human response and makes you LIVE it  Of course it s not 5 stars in the same way To Kill a Mockingbird  Catcher in the Rye  or One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest are 5 stars  but it s 5 stars alongside its peers  Gone Girl  Girl With the Dragon Tattoo  and other contemporary thrillers  I had a blast reading it   The 5  rating is more as a testament to the engaging force of this book  I found myself eager to read  even just little snippets of the unfolding story  By no means a perfect book  but pure escapism     It did make me want to drink constantly   Unexpected turnI couldn t put it down and the ending was incredible  This must be a definite addition to your reading list  This book was a fast paced thriller that I couldn t put down  Yes thoughts of Gone Girl flittered through my head as I read the book but I liked this one so much better  The pace is sharp   dynamic  It does go from one characters perspective to another which I often think is cheating even if I enjoy it but the different views into the other characters does help the layering of the story  Rachel  the main character  is depressed   an alcoholic prone to blackouts from drinking binges  She takes the train to work each day   catches glimpses of other  seemingly better lives  in apartments the train passes by  She hears of a murder of one of the occupants  someone she thought seemed to lead an idyllic life   decides to get involved in the mystery  Of course this is crazy to do   it gets her into all sorts of trouble bit it was an engaging   satisfying read  Everybody and their mom have read this book  now I  too  have joined the crowd  and loved it God  such excellent uses of so many day to day paranoias  Do our memories  and our perception of ourselves match what others see and remember of us   Lemme tell you  reading this book messed with my social anxiety big time  but the plot was so engrossing that I kept reading anyways  but yeah  trigger warning for those of us with social anxiety   How do we navigate our perception of the others  and how do we judge them clearly when they are feeding us the stories that mass culture assiduously teaches us to expect  and when we are happy  moreover  to impose such narratives on them   Then  with the alienation of the urbanites  you are often expected to get glimpses of other people s lives  but not much by way of significant interaction  how is one supposed to react when something one sees demands an immediate reaction   but then  how much info  can  a fleeting glimpse yield   Etc   etc All in all  seriously addictive  A  usage of unreliable narrators  great collage of the creepy and the mundane  Recommended  God  I didn t expect to love it as much as I did The one minor thing is  I m still not sold on the idea of Anna s POV  The juxtaposition of Rachel s and Megan s POVs was neat  because they are pretty much polar opposites in terms of the sources of their discontents  cannot say more without spoiling several major plot points   whereas Anna isn t  and  moreover  is much closer to a stereotypical cackling villain than any other character  I don t think one can  or is supposed to even  to feel any sympathy for her  which marks her out against all other characters  Mysterious Book Report No  175by John Dwaine McKennaWe ve just returned from the annual Mountains and Plains Booksellers Association Trade Show in Denver  Colorado  It s a yearly affair with 70 or 80 publishers  several hundred bookstore

holiday seasons in every imaginable category from anthologies to zoology  In our area of interest  crime fiction  thrillers and mysteries  two books were standouts  gathering special attention from everyone  We ll review one this week and the second one next week The Girl on the train   Riverhead Books Penguin Group  USA  LLC   26 95  325 pages  ISBN 978 1 59463 366 9  by Paula Hawkins is due for release on 15 January 2015  and the movie rights have already been purchased by DreamWorks Studios  It s getting an extensive national marketing campaign and will be one of the most talked about books in the coming year  Why  Because it s one of the most psychologically thrilling and intense murder mysteries you will ever in your life read  Alfred Hitchcock is probably turning over in his grave with envy because he won t get to film this one      In it  a woman named Rachael takes a train into London every morning of the work week  Each day  it s the same train  at the same time  she sits in the same seat  and the train stops at the exact same time and place  day after day  The sheer boredom of it is mind numbing and soul searing  So much so  that Rachael makes up an imaginary life and name for a woman she spots drinking coffee on the balcony of her house  which is one of a row of houses near the tracks where the train stops day after day  Most times Rachael sees a man with the woman and she imagines a life for the pair of them  Then  one morning Rachael sees a different man on the balcony  engaged in a passionate kiss with the woman  A few days later the woman  whose real name is Megan  has disappeared without a trace  Rachael s imagination runs wild with possibilities       then a neighbor named Anna enters the narrative       and from her perspective it s revealed that Rachael is an unreliable witness  one who has a hard time distinguishing between reality and fantasy  who may in fact be dangerous  The rest of the novel unfolds like an onion  one layer at a time  as it s told in first person narratives by Rachael  Anna and Megan  Each chapter  and almost every page  ratchets up the tension as it reveals some exciting  surprising new element to the plot until everyone is the potential killer  and the real murderer lurks in plain sight  right in their midst as Rachael tries to sort out which of her memories are real and which are imaginary  The Girl on the Train will keep you guessing right up to the end and so engrossed in it s pages that you won t know if there s a train wreck in your own front yard  It lives up to its potential in every way  and is one of the most outstanding debut novels in a long  long time  You ll be sorry if you miss it The Girl on the TrianLike the review  The greatest compliment you can give is to share it with others on Facebook and follow us on Goodreads www Facebook com JohnDwaineMcKennawww Goodreads com JohnDwaineMcKenna This was a great ride  The unique concept of the plot pulled me in  the growing tangle of events kept me turning pages  The narrative moves between three women whose voices are so similar  I sometimes confused who was speaking and had to go back and check  None of them were particularly likeable or easy to identify with  The timeline jumps around  But all in all it wasn t that hard to follow and the action was intriguing  This is good  solid storytelling and I enjoyed every minute  Couldn t stop reading till I got to the end   Wow        A suspenseful thriller with lots of twists in the plot  Narrated by three women  one a drunk  one a liar  and one a cheater  Who do you believe  Who do you root for  This book makes you think twice about what you may casually observe of other people s lives when you re out and about or at home with your blinds open or sitting on your porch  The Girl on the Train is an intense psychological thriller that s difficult to put down   Everyone in this book is absolutely horrible  and as a result I couldnt stop reading it to see what terrible things they would do next  It s also a well written psychological thriller  with a couple of different narrator with added great point of view  I think it s also interesting that the central character  Rachel  challenges readers to think about how much we assume  pre judge about other people based on our limited knowledge of them  I will see what else the author has to offer for sure  Whoa  Just as good as what all the other reviews are saying  Psychological thriller like Gone Girl and has all the makings to be a blockbuster film  Started it last night  got up this morning and couldn t put it down until the last page was read  ACTUALIZACION 24 12 2015 Si hay algo que me olvide de comentar es que el libro  mi edicion  venia con faltas de ortografia   errores de dedo  y demas  que lo unico que hacia era entorpecer mi lectura  FIN DE LA ACTUALIZACION OPINION INICIAL  OH POR DIOS Que final Las primeras paginas fueron de lo mas aburrido  no avanzaba mas  Iba todo increiblemente lento  hasta la pagina 250  Ahi fue cuando todo se puso realmente interesante  sin contar las ultimas 50  que fueron lo mejor  Me tuvo tan enganchada que hasta deje a mi novio colgado en whatsapp No me esperaba que termine asi  estan todos realmente enfermos y locos  Aunque a muchos les caiga mal Rachel  a mi no  Creo que hasta en un punto llegue a entenderla  Lo unico que no me cuadra es que despues de dos anos siga enganchada con un tipo que no le da ni la hora  I LOVED this book  I ve been reading a lot of historical fiction lately  which is my favorite genre  but I felt I needed a little something different  I had heard a lot of great things about this novel  so I decided to give it a try  I m so glad I did  This is the first novel in a long time I couldn t wait to get back to and I finished it in two days  It s a fast read  but in a good way  The chapters fly by and I found myself saying the old  Just one more chapter tonight   just one more chapter    I figured out whodunit less than halfway through  but that didn t stop my enjoyment of the rest of novel  I liked seeing how the main narrator  Rachel  figured out the mystery of who murdered the young woman Megan  I thought Rachel was a very realistic character  faults and all  and I believe a lot of people can relate to the way she idealized strangers she sees out of a train window  Many of us think the grass is always greener on the other side  I thought the lesson Rachel learns at the end  that things  even the things we re closest to  are not always what they seem  is an important one we all need to learn  I will definitely be seeking out more novels from Paula Hawkins   loved it  Rachel was so raw it was almost painful to read each time she took a drink  very well done  Riding the train morning and evening  Rachel imagines the lives of those she sees through the windows  Those living in the houses facing the tracks  She has a special attachment to one young couple she calls Jason and Jess   and imagines the perfect life they share  And down the street from their home is where Tom and Rachel once lived  and where he now lives with his new wife Anna and their baby  Can anything feel more painful Rachel s life is a disaster area   a broken marriage  and a husband who cheated on her  She is an alcoholic and her husband reminded her often enough that she was to blame for everything  Her blackouts make it hard for her to counter his view of their life together Narrated by Rachel  Megan  Jess   and Anna  we begin to see that nothing is as it seems  The timeline for the stories takes us back and forth  from Rachel in the present to Megan in the past  with the story slowly moving forward to a significant date  the day Megan went missing This is the part where I must leave off describing the events  as those who read it must discover the truths on their own  just as I did  Some might say that all of our narrators were  unreliable   but some partial truths were hidden beneath all the stories  and it was impossible for me not to have a favorite narrator  One I believed more than the others  The Girl on the Train  A Novel  was a riveting thriller that kept me glued to the pages until the very end  reminding me once again that life  and fiction  can throw many curves  5 0 stars  wonderful  first book I have read in a long time I had trouble putting down  sad it s over  Para ser honesta  esta es una de las pocas novelas que me ha motivado ultimamente  Definitivamente no era para nada lo que esperaba  Paula Hawkings entrega un thriller bastante interesante y con giros totalmente inesperados  Hay quienes lo aman  otros no tanto  en especial por la forma en la que esta escrito pero para mi ello le anadio mucha mas profundidad a la historia  Parte de las personas que han hecho comentarios dicen que el problema que ven es que cada uno de los personajes es un desastre    desde cierta perspectiva es asi  pero hay que preguntarles a estas personas quien no lo es  todos tenemos errores  cosas buenas  malas  etc   por el contrario si la protagonista fuera buena y fuerte  perfecta  se tendria que cuestionar su fallido matrimonio  y lo mismo ocurre con el resto de los personajes  No entiendo como hay personas que esperan que los personajes de las novela sean equilibrados  bonitos y perfectos en muchos sentidos  cuando en realidad los seres humanos estamos llenos de defectos y en ocasiones no conocemos los problemas y fallos de los que se encuentran a nuestro alrededor   I really liked this book  I see that some reviewers didn t like it and thought it was a rather lame mystery  I  on the other hand  thought it was a gripping and suspenseful psychological thriller  I couldn t put it down  Yes  the characters weren t necessarily likeable as people  but they were sympathetic  and I wasn t sure  who done it  until the end  I thought the author was pretty good at making me wonder about several of the different characters at various points in the book  I can t tell what else I thought was so good without giving anything away  so suffice it to say I recommend the book to anyone looking for a good  quick read mystery  Great readI really enjoyed this book  although it took a while to get into  Once you are in  though  you will want to keep reading  Cuando un libro no revela demasiado de si mismo en la contratapa o  aunque sea  en alguna de las solapas  o es un completo exito o un tremendo desastre   La chica del tren  encaja a la perfeccion en el primer grupo  Es un libro que los atrapara ni bien comiencen a leerlo  y tanto sera que no podran soltarlo  Asi que comiencen su lectura con esta advertencia Yo no lo habia visto en la libreria  me entere de esta obra por una noticia en un sito de la web en el que se anunciaba que ya se habian vendido los derechos para hacerlo pelicula  con Emily Blunt como posible actriz principal   En la nota se mencionaba que era un libro que habia reventado las ventas en Estados Unidos  y a partir de alli  comence a indagar acerca de el Todos los comentarios que leia acerca de la novela eran positivos  y todos mencionaban el hecho de la adiccion a sus paginas  En mi caso  lo termine de leer en un dia y medio  La lectura es agil  interesante y enganosa  que hace que prestes atencion a cada detalle  porque no sabes bien que es cierto y que no La obra gira en torno de tres personajes  Rachel  Megan y Anna  Esta narrado en primera persona con capitulos que se intercalan y te van contando de a poco la historia para que en tu cabeza puedas ir armando el puzzle  La chica del tren es Rachel  una mujer con un pasado complicado que ha derivado en su problema con el alcohol y con las terribles consecuencias de este  como tener lagunas mentales y no recordar en absoluto lo que hizo en un momento en particular  Su vida es un pena  por ello  cada dia cuando toma en tren  tanto a la manana como a la tarde  para ir a su lugar de trabajo  se imagina la vida perfecta de una pareja que habita en una casa donde siempre su tren se detiene ante la senal de un semaforo  A estas dos personas le inventa nombres  Jess y Jason  actividades  profesiones y demas  Hasta que un dia ve algo extrano y a partir de alli  se dedica a resolver este misterio La historia esta narrada de tal forma que no te deja soltarla  porque a cada paso quieres saber por que suceden las cosas que pasan   Por que Rachel es asi   Y que papeles juegan Megan y Anna en esta historia  Si tienen dudas acerca de comprarlo  saquenselas porque es hiper recomendable  atrapante y adictivo   No se lo pueden perder  What just happened  The book started of a little slow for me and the timeline of the story was a bit confusing at first but after awhile things really took off  I am sure I am not the first to admit that people watching can be entertaining  Watching strangers you ve never met   making up stories about their lives can always be good fun  Who knew it could turn out to be so dangerous too   This book introduced the reader to 3 very different and very troubled   somewhat horrible  although not always completely their fault  women  We got a brief glimpse into their lives   we got to see how the coped with the struggles life threw at them  This book is a great example of showing how messy life can be  What may seem perfect on the outside may actually be far from it  Talk about a page turner  I could not put it down  Move over Gone Girl  When is this going to be a movie  I m serious  It seems like they make movies of books half this good so        This is brilliant  I took a chance on it  I got the audio version  and am glad I used a free Audible credit for it  WORTH IT  This is an alternating POV story of three women who s lives intertwine  The characters are so vivid and real  I have to say I think they are the most real characters I ve read in a long time  Rachel is an alcoholic  a little pathetic  but sympathetic  I found that even though she comes across as terrible in the beginning I liked her anyway   maybe b c I could understand her sorrow and why she was driven to drink  She was weak  but knew it  She grew over the course of the book and I found myself liking her even more  Megan comes across as flighty and manipulative at times  As her story develops you can see the trauma in her past and why she runs away from everything and why she has such deep seated issues  She s a likable character even though she s a mess and doesn t start off seeming like a good person  You learn more about her as the story progresses  Anna    well   she s never anything but a terrible horrible B  From the first moment she comes into the story to the last she is hateful and cruel  I actually liked this about her  as a literary character  because I hated her so much  every time she opened her mouth  It s rare when I want to punch a character in the face so badly   so I love that the author could create someone so hateful  But as for Anna herself  ugh  Whiny  nasty  all around terrible person  I don t think I ever felt for her  aside from rage   There are quite a few other side characters   a mix of ok and pure awful  The story is simple  it s the characters and how they intermix that gets complex  I didn t find the ending totally a surprise   there were parts of it that were twists  but I didn t think it was totally a shocker  i e  I could understand how it happened the way it did  but I didn t anticipate it   Highly recommended read   or listen   the quality of the audio is great  The voice actresses really made the characters real  vs sounding like a person reading a book   this was the best narration I ve heard to date with audio books  An intricately woven plot which keeps you gripped from start to finish  A definite must read for people who love thrillers                                               all the feels  within the last 5 or so pages  I honestly had low expectations of this book because everyone spoke so highly of it  and it was consistently rated as an excellent book  Typically  I tend to deviate in my literary tastes when it comes to popular  excellent  writing  This book did NOT disappoint  though  I was literally on the edge of my seat as I read the last few chapters  and that s the kind of thing that s only happened with  some  of Mary Higgins Clark s books  I LOVE that I wasn t completely sure of who did it until I was about 3 4 of the way through the book   and even then I was doubtful that I was right  I do have some questions  though  mostly like what happened to all of the other key players  But Hawkins definitely delivered   I can only hope that Dreamworks does her writing justice  Reflecting on my experience with this book  I feel giddy   like a schoolgirl with the juiciest gossip  or a child with  5 that I just can t wait to spend  I am so happy that this book was well written   I needed a book like this in my life right about now  I hope she continues writing and that her future books are just as good  if not better  Wow  This book had me on the edge of my seat and I had a really hard time putting it down  I loved how the characters were so intertwined and how the secrets of their lives were slowly revealed  I did have some of it figured out before the end  but the added twists and inclusion of background stories of the characters prevented me from completely guessing what was going to happen  It certainly is a darker story and one that deals with some topics that aren t usually discussed  but I think it s done in a tasteful way and opens up means for communicating about those topics  I felt it was very well written  This one will stay with me for awhile  Each character is so flawed and in so many ways  You keep guessing in your head what really happened  You think it makes sense  but it s never right  And then you see it all come together   and it s mind blowing   Great book with a lot of unforeseeable twists that keeps you wanting to read more   Every spare moment I found  I devoured this book  Realistic  somewhat horrible characters with lives all twisted and connected  Secrets  suspense and suspicions  I figured it out pretty quickly but it still didn t take away from the revelation  The main character  Rachel would have been shaken so hard had she been real   she infuriated me  All the characters had their irksome traits and it was interesting to see the social side versus the private side of characters  much like life  Exciting and thrilling  I loved it  There are not many times that I can honestly say I was sad to finish a book  but  The Girl on the Train  did exactly that  This book is a complete masterpiece that never leaves your mind  even when you are not reading it you are thinking about it  Every character is perfectly developed  allowing the reader to create such an emotional connection with them and what they have been through   The Girl on the Train  is not only a mysterious thriller  but also a gut wrenching look into the the life of someone who suffers from addiction and obsession  Full of twist and turns this book is an emotional roller coaster that keeps the reader wanting more   The Girl on the Train  is a must read for everyone   Fast read that had my attention from start to finish  omg  esta muy buena la historia jamas pense que el era el culpable  es mas llegue a dudar de la misma protagonista  I was very skeptical about this book at first  I wasn t sure I would like it or that it would be good enough to keep my attention past the first few pages  Though it was not super interesting from the beginning  you have to really read past the first chapter or two to really get into this book  Personally  I loved and really enjoyed reading this book  It was definitely a good read as it somehow managed to capture my attention and keep me anxious and wondering for more  It s a great suspense filled novel that though the plot may seem clear and though there are many clues as to what is really happening somehow you refuse to even consider it  and so it really is a great read   As this book was highly recommended  i couldn t wait to get my hands on it  When i bought myself a copy i started it pretty much straight away  I have to say i was hooked from the very first page  It is gripping and it leaves you wanting to read the next page and the next    I thoroughly enjoyed it  There are some clever twists involved which the reader doesn t expect and the story keeps you guessing untill the end  it s unpredictable and engrossing  This is the kind of book that leaves you thinking about it for days after you ve read it and that s usually a good thing  The characters were well formed  as well as the setting  definitely a thumbs up  I am going to have a book hang over now after reading this  Five big shiny stars this book deserves  This is about a woman who has lost her sense of self  lost everything but her life  She is unable to move on  Her husband has remarried and they have a child  Rachel  the girl on the train  has moved in with a friend and has lost her job  though she rides in every day to the city on the train  trying not to have to tell her friend that she is jobless  that she got fired  While riding the train  she watches the neighborhood she used to live in  and a couple in one of the houses captured her imagination  She gives them names and fantasizes about their lives  Then there is a murder  No one knows who has done it  Rachel imagines her own scenario from what she has observed while watching while on the train  The characters are well drawn  the narration perfect  giving the female characters definitive voices  You can feel them  hear them  know them  The author narrates from each of the main female voices  We mostly can empathize with Rachel  even though she has let herself go physically and drinks herself into oblivion  Even though she has lost herself  I highly recommend this book  Some say  better than Gone Girl  but I would not go that far  It was very good  on its own merits  I am glad I listened to it rather than reading it  It really brought the characters to life for me  And it is told by the female characters   I m giving this a 5 star rating because I really  really enjoyed this book and the whole concept is just so amazing  Even though I already figured out who the culprit is from the first few pages  I still find myself holding my breath in some parts or sticking my nose on the screen as if I can magically enter inside the book and see it all happen with my own eyes  I was wretched when I finished reading it and I wish I could read this for the first time again Very thought provoking and intriguing  People who liked Gone Girl should read this    I never thought there could be a book that would rattle my mental state like this did  It s filled with characters that are driven by their own ego and pride  almost to the point that some are just rotten to the core  but that s what makes this book that good  Like a train ride  nothing in this story is a smooth ride  it has sharp turns and moves rapidly  You simply have to brace yourself and hope you are ready when it all comes to a screeching halt    I can t remember the last time I holed myself up in the house  tucked into my favorite chair on a lazy weekend  and devoured a book from cover to cover  I know there are different renditions of reader experiences here  Maybe I m easy to please when it comes to psychological thrillers  But I could not put this book down  And also  probably unlike many  I didn t see the ending coming  I m not really sure what I thought was going to happen  I just had to keep turning pages  Yes  I know  This is supposed to be the  modern  Gone Girl  which I also read  but more slowly   But I disagree  This book is in a class of its own  a creepy character study that requires you to turn over events again and again long after you ve read the last page  For that reason alone  I have to congratulate Hawkins  I don t usually like this genre  Creepy unnerves me  and murder mysteries aren t my thing  But if you weave in some amazing characters  and artfully written dialogue  I might just have to stick with it until I ve soaked in every last word I can t wait to see if the movie matches my image of the book  Awesome  A gripping thriller that truly keeps you guessing until the end   and what an ending   Best book I ve read all summer  Wish there was a sequel    I literally could not put this book down  Now  for another page turner   Massively enjoyed this book  ITCHING to write a thriller now   The Girl on the Train is told by the viewpoint of three troubled women whose lives intertwined through a series of lies  manipulation  infidelity and possible murder  The heart of the story is Rachel Watson  a lonely  broken alcoholic who travels back and forth by train to a job that no longer exists  The train stops at a signal where she has clear view her old house  that bring back memories of a marriage filled with sadness and betrayal  A few houses down  she observes a seemingly perfect  loving couple conversing on their deck  They are a reminder of what she once had  loved and lost  She starts to fantasies about them  Naming them and imagining what they do for a living  Eventually this innocent observation turns into an unhealthy fixation  when she witnesses something out of the ordinary that really upsets her  and she feels it s necessary to become personally involved The Girl on the Train is a captivating debut novel that had my stomach in knots the whole time from worry and tension  There was an all important criminal investigation running alone side the plot but for some reason it didn t hold my attention until it was all revealed at the very end  My major concern was Rachel s alcoholism  how remarkably real and believable it was  Rachel has a history of blackout during her drinking binges  And it was during these blackouts that her behavior spiraled out of control and was appalling  And in some cases it would appear as threatening  When she sobered up  she was not fully aware of what she had done  or what is real  or what is a figment of her imagination  The unreliability of her narrative and the unknown truths behind the blackouts made it an additive and suspenseful read  Yet it was frustrating and disconcerting that she wasn t taking these episodes more seriously  where as I   like her housemate   would react quite strongly  Skillfully plotted and a first class psychological thriller that s so easy to read  Which is ideal  because there s so many twist and uncertainties you want to devour it really quickly  Although this book did not hook me on the opening  it was brilliantly plotted  The chosen construction is difficult to pull off  but Hawkins did it to perfection  The story begins in the middle  goes forward for short periods and is filled in through a number of flashbacks  I purchased the audio book edition  which is they way I like to try unfamiliar authors  While the opening was not the most compelling  it held my interest and I would not have laid it aside  Hawkins has four believable suspects keeping readers guessing to the very end  When I came to the last twist  I knew I would want to replay this novel from the beginning  The story was told from the viewpoints of 3 women  There were no unreliable narrators  Since the novel I am currently working on will have a two or three month flashback  this was a terrific novel to study  I enjoyed it the second time around even more than the first  I love it when an author makes me care about unlikable people  Sharp writing  nothing contrived  Very  very nicely done   IS THIS A JOKE  THIS HAS TO BE A JOKE  OH MY GOD WHAT EVEN IS THIS BOOK I CAN T BREATHE  Simply amazing  I listened to the audio version  The three female narrators representing the three different povs did an excellent job  Their voices were pleasant and their acting skills were spot on  Rachel Watson is a drunk  She lost her husband  her home  her job  She s been divorced for two years but she s still having trouble accepting it  She misses Tom  even though he left her for another woman and he s happy with her and their baby  Rachel takes the train every day and she s become a bit obsessed with a beautiful couple that she sees in their house from the train window  She s made up names for them and given them a story  They are her ideal couple  They remind her of what she used to have  But one day she sees something out of the train window that bursts her perfect image  And witnessing this one thing gets her caught up in a very intriguing mystery Megan seems to have it all but her life is not as ideal as it appears  She has quite the secret Anna is the new Mrs  Watson  She s had it up to here with Rachel drunk dialing Tom and walking by the house all the time  But she and Rachel may have more in common than she wants to admit Hawkins takes her time letting us get to know the characters  Rachel s story is tragic but I was rooting for her the entire time  Hawkins kept me guessing all the way til the end  Bravo  Wow  this was one great book  A psychological thriller on the order of Gone Girl  completely unsettling  yet impossible to put down  The main character was pretty much void of any redeeming qualities  but somehow  I was still pulling for her  The narrator changes back and forth with each chapter and that works so well in this book  The author did a great job of unfolding the plot  thanks in large part to the methodical pace of the story  What a great job of building the tension  chapter by chapter  as Rachel makes one giant blunder after another  This is one of the best book I ve read recently   This book is sooooooooooooo good I read it so fast because the book demands to not be put down for anything  The story moves along at a quick pace  but it keeps you guessing constantly The book revolves mainly around three women  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  All three women are linked to one major event and one character in particular  What starts off as a missing person s investigation  quickly turns into a homicide investigation with lethal danger lurking for our key characters The story has the pulse of a thriller and the suspense of a mystery novel that throws red herrings your way each time you think you know who s behind it all  And  when the big reveal happens in the last act of the book  you just aren t sure who s going to survive Paula Hawkins crafted a novel that consumes you almost immediately  Her insight into alcoholism  and how she employs it with one of our main characters  is amazingly on point and adds more weight to the story  I also have to give Hawkins major props for her non linear approach  What could have been confusing and convoluted in a lesser author s hands works to perfection in this novel I wholeheartedly recommend this book with no reservations and I only wish that I had an option to give this six stars  If Hawkins has any more like this coming up  I ll be the first in line to buy the book   Please  Rachel  don t take that drink  Pour it down the sink  Don t make that phone call  Quit harassing your ex husband  Quit peering out the train window at those two houses you pass every day  But Rachel answers only to the demons within her  She takes that drink  makes that call  rides that train  and she sinks lower and lower into a morass of lies  She staggers from pub to the streets of London to one or the other of those two houses  and all we want is for her to get her life back together  I hope the movie is half as good as the book   4 5 stars   This started off slow and not my favorite  but the more I got to know Rachel  the more involved I got in the story  At first I thought it was a book full of crazy  unlikable people and I dreaded listening to it  But  About a third in  I really fell into the story and was excited about what would be revealed next  Another reviewer mentioned they  got  Rachel and that is exactly how I felt  I could understand   empathize with what happened was happening to Rachel and with her thoughts   emotions  I started to care about her and could see how she got to where she  and at least one other character  was  I think if you don t reach that point  you won t like the book very much  The train perspective was interesting too  Almost every character in this book is dysfunctional in some way  but that made for an entertaining read   As far as it being like Gone Girl  I personally don t really think so  They both are full of unlikable people and are suspenseful as things get revealed but IMO this was better  I know many will disagree  but that s just me   An absolutely engrossing  amazing mystery  Have you ever experienced something so good  that words fail you  All you can come up with are gasps and hand gestures and other assorted noises of awe and titillation  This book has done that for me    I don t have any words  This book stressed me out in the best way possible  I m sad that there are no more fiction books by Paula Hawkins  I really enjoyed this  I figured out what was going on about 2 3 of the way through but that did not stop me from thoroughly enjoying it  Tell me I m not the only one who s played this game  you see a couple in a restaurant or bar and you make up your own version of their life or the conversation that they are having  you imagine what their life together must be like  good or bad  and wonder what goes on behind closed doors  The Girl on the Train begins in a similar way and  after you ve read this one  I can guarantee that you ll never go through that  game  again without thinking of this story I requested a review copy of this novel before I d read or heard anything about it  to tell you the truth  I was ready for a mystery and the cover looked interesting  I had no idea what I d gotten myself into with this one  I ve read some early reviews  now that I ve finished the book  a couple of  notable  reviewers have referred to Ms  Hawkins as an author who is not quite as  razor sharp  as Gillian Flynn in Gone Girl  but I beg to differ There are certainly valid comparisons to be made  but I find Hawkins  characters to be somewhat grittier and riddled with lifelong problems  outside of the ones brought forth by the end of the novel  I couldn t help sympathizing with all of them  They are messy  alcoholism  divorce  infertility   they have secrets  lovers  dead children  unemployment  and they are all brought together by Rachel  she is the girl on the train  envisioning what must be the perfect lives of those individuals who inhabit the homes along her daily ride to work While there is not much I can tell you  plot wise  for fear of spoiling a tale that has lots of twists and turns  I will say that I was completely drawn in by these characters  even though the chapters are alternatively narrated by the characters  I had no trouble following along and picking up small tidbits about each of them within every page  I was also fascinated with Hawkins  reflection on what it is that we  as human beings  are able to truly remember recall based on what we ve told ourselves about a particular event  memories are often manipulated by the human brain to protect us  without us knowing it  and getting the truth to the surface  as demonstrated in The Girl on the Train  can be a painful experience  As far as those comparing this to Gone Girl  which I read and enjoyed  I don t think this book was at all the same  Gone Girl being intentionally fast paced and sort of hectic while The Girl on the Train takes it time  lets you get to know this horrible group of characters in a way you would a new acquaintance you aren t yet too sure about  I thoroughly enjoyed the lack of some majestic main character that  did no wrong  and was  true at heart   this book was far more realistic to the general population as far as their personalities and actions  The story line was sort of paced and stretched out enough to where I found the plot twists and new shocking bits of information to be a pleasantly sharp contrast with the sleepy lives of the characters  The daily drag of the story really had me feeling more connected with the people  made it easier to immerse myself into their lives  If you re the kind of reader that enjoys a book that ll take you places in a more organic fashion  with the sour twists of a good ol  Who Done It  I d highly recommend   Simplesmente espectacular  Muito bem escrito  de forma original  em que a accao e sempre descrita no passado ao estilo de diarios que se cruzam das varias personagens  Um thriller excitante ao melhor estilo de Hitchcock  Um dos melhores Whodunit que ja li  Recomendo   Holy Moly  I not only couldn t put this book down   I started to question my own sanity at times which made me have to go back and double check what I was reading  Though three points of view   the author does a fantastic job clearly identifying each character  Well done  Everyone in this book is nutty as a fruitcake  and I loved every second of it  THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN by Paula Hawkins was not just a publishing juggernaut last year when it was released  It s also going down in the history books as the fastest selling adult novel ever  with two million copies sold in the first four months after its release  according to its publisher  Riverhead  It spent a total of eighteen weeks as a  1 New York Times bestseller  eleven weeks more than GONE GIRL  the  domestic noir  thriller to which it s most often compared  This fall we ll be able to compare the movies as well  THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN starring Emily Blunt as Rachel Watson will arrive in theaters in October The setup is simple  every weekday Rachel rides the train from suburban London into the city  lost in her own small  melancholy world  Invariably she perks up when the train whisks her past the neighborhood where she used to live  closer in and more affluent  Rachel wasn t alone in those days  she was happily married  But those days are gone  and now Rachel is lost in a miasma of unemployment  poverty  depression  alcoholism  and loneliness  She finds a twisted purpose  though  by fixating on a seemingly perfect couple that lives near her old digs  She can spy them from the train and one day witnesses the female half of that sun kissed couple doing something she shouldn t     and we re off The book is a page turner  more creepy and mysterious than frightening  though terrifying moments come when I wondered just what Rachel might be capable of  What had she done  What might she still do  Rachel excels at making bad  and dangerous  decisions  but I rooted for her all the same  which is a tribute to Hawkins  considerable skill at creating the character  I also had to wonder how many Rachels are out there  living the proverbial  lives of quiet desperation   Rachel envies women who have more than she does  unaware  at least for a time  that those women are coexisting with their own dashed hopes The novel is very insular  we re almost always mired in Rachel s little world  There are scenes from the points of view of other characters  but while those are interesting  to me they re not as powerful  I want to be back in Rachel s less than clear head  keen to find out whether she ll live to solve the mystery at the book s heart  and  more importantly  the riddle of her own life THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is Hawkins  first thriller  and boy  did she hit it out of the park  but she has several published chick lit novels under her belt as well  under the pen name Amy Silver and with titles like CONFESSIONS OF A RELUCTANT RECESSIONISTA and ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS  The former financial journalist described them to Daily Beast as  fantastic as a learning experience   I got a chuckle out of the author s bio on Amazon   She lives in London and has a penchant for vintage clothes and champagne cocktails  but she always pays her credit card bills on time   And that was before she wrote a record breaking bestselling novel  Kudos to her   It s impossible to resist the kindness of strangers  Someone who looks at you  who doesn t know you  who tells you it s OK  whatever you did  whatever you ve done  you suffered  you hurt  you deserve forgiveness    The Girl on the Train  Paula Hawkins  It had taken me a while to finish this book because of two deaths in the family  a newborn baby  and school textbooks consuming most of my reading time  So  you can imagine how excited I was to finally have some free time to finish this book over my holiday break The characters in this book are so easy to hate  Yes  every single character in this book is an asshole  There were moments that I wanted to shoot each one  I do not want to give away too much because you should really read this book without having any knowledge of the characters  their past  and their habits  TheGirlOnTheTrain is a GREAT read  I gave it five    s on GoodReads  I highly recommend this book and I cannot wait to see what the author   PaulaHawkins has in store  Estar atento e deixar que a imaginacao comece a funcionar nem sempre corre bem na vida de uma viajante no tempo  tal como o que aconteceu com A Rapariga no Comboio  Rachel  Numa obra onde a verdade se liga com a imaginacao neste thriller os factos sao transformados pela pura criacao que alguem vai fazendo ao longo do tempo simplesmente atraves da observacao de vidas desconhecidas ate entao  Paula Hawkins e uma das autoras do momento com este livro que tem feito furor junto de leitores assiduos dos mais vendidos e nao so  Confesso que comprei este livro por ter de reforcar as leituras que tinha levado comigo de ferias e por ser o melhor classificado na tabela de vendas  Se errei na escolha  Nada disso  bem pelo contrario A Rapariga no Comboio e um dos livros do ano  sem duvida alguma  Com uma morte a dar o mote para os desenvolvimentos seguintes  rapidamente as personagens entram em accao e ganham relevo junto do leitor que tenta a todo o custo decifrar quem podera ser o verdadeiro culpado de todo o misterio que envolve o desaparecimento de Megan  Qual a explicacao para uma mulher supostamente feliz num casamento desaparecer subitamente sem deixar rasto  As verdades vao aparecendo  sempre com toques imaginativos de personagens que acreditam ter visto uma coisa quando na realidade o alcool as transforma noutras  Como uma simples viagem consegue transformar a vida de alguem que sempre se tentou manter a leste  Como o passado desse alguem fica subitamente envolvido num caso com que aparentemente nada tem em comum consigo  Uma complexa historia onde os poucos envolvidos chegam perfeitamente para levar o suspense embutido nestas mais de trezentas paginas em frente  Deverei confessar que o culpado de toda esta situacao envolvente so foi descoberto por mim mesmo perto do final de tudo  quando o circulo se comeca a apertar e ja poucos suspeitos podem ter misterios omitidos nas suas vidas Violencia  alcoolismo  amor  traicao  misterio  homicidios  viagens e ligacoes pessoais sao os principais bombons que A Rapariga no Comboio serve aos seus leitores atraves de uma escrita fluida  sem grandes oscilacoes e onde tres mulheres vao reflectindo sobre o que tem sido as suas vidas ao longo de pouco mais de um ano  onde o passado vai sendo contado ao lado do presente  Um livro aconselhado e que deixa os leitores agarrados ate que o final apareca e a perda de controlo de cada criacao ficcional seja desvendada  Great Book   This book was overall very dark  depressing and full of surprises and I enjoyed all of it  It s one of those books that you either love it or you hate it  For me  the writing was amazing  It was a thriller and it was the kind of book that made your heart beat faster and faster  page by page  Every character in the book is dealing with a lot and that could be viewed as very irritating  but to me  it just made it better  The ending is what I enjoyed the most and was very satisfying  It has to be one of my favorites and I can t wait for the movie   4 5 StarsThe Girl on the Train has been the buzz book for a while now  I couldn t wait to read it   but I had to because of the monstrous waiting list at my library  But alas my wait was over and I couldn t have been happier  This is a hard review to write because it is pretty much a less you know the better it is type of story so it might be a bit brief   but it s for the best I promise  The whole thing was actually your fault  Rachel  We start with Rachel  On a train  The Girl on the Train  See that we got the title settled straight away  Whew  We start with her whizzing past houses on her way into the city  As it goes on we see her preoccupation with a couple  who she has named Jess and Jason  I will say the beginning was a bit disconcerting  especially with dates at the beginning of each chapter  This always jams me up in a book because I can never remember what the dates are  if we are going back at a point in time or forward or chronologically following the story  When I finally got my bearings I got what it all was and was on my way into the dark and twisty world that this book was We have the narration broken down into Morning and Evening with multiple POVs including Rachel  Megan  Jess as Rachel initially refers to her as  and Anna who is Rachel s ex husband s new wife  I have lost control over everything  even the places in my head  Right away I knew Rachel wasn t all there but wasn t sure if she was just plain old crazy or something else  You do find out her story as it slowly unfolds helping to put a lot of things seen earlier into perspective  He never understood that it s possible to miss what you ve never had  to mourn for it  The Megan part of the story is a little while before Rachel s  We see her life with Scott   aka Jason  and her interactions with Anna  who is her neighbor  He loves me so much  it makes me ache  Anna comes into the book and we see her views of both Megan and Rachel  She doesn t think much of either of them  especially Rachel  We see her life with Rachel s ex husband and their new baby These three women s lives are so interconnected  whether it be clear or less obvious  that they all wind up playing a large part in each other s lives in some way  Also  they are all kind of terrible and totally unreliable  And that made it fun  The holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mould yourself through the gaps  The entire time I was reading this I had this queazy  uneasy  anxious feeling  Thankfully it didn t last long because I couldn t put it down and flew through the story  I loved its dark tone  fast pace and how well it was written  I love multiple points of view and liked the Morning Evening dynamic  I think I  figured it out  pretty late in the game  like probably when she meant for me to  and it was still great getting to the finish to find out what happens  If you love psychological thrillers  liked Gone Girl or want to find out what all the hype is about   I say go for it  It lives up to all the buzz See other reviews at Rebel Mommy Book Blog Such an easy  yet entertaining read  I love a good psycho thriller  Gone Girl was too sick and twisted for me  but this one had just the right amount of crazy to keep me interested   This book will rope you into its madness from page one  Told from several perspectives  it has the perfect ingredients for a great thriller  It was a book I couldn t wait to pick up again once I put it down  A page turner   I LOVED this book  I couldn t put it down  I really knew nothing about this book  but once I started reading it I couldn t stop   Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning  Every day she rattles down the track  flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes  and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck  She s even started to feel like she knows them   Jess and Jason   she calls them  Their life  as she sees it  is perfect  Not unlike the life she recently lost And then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough  Now everything s changed  Unable to keep it to herself  Rachel offers what she knows to the police  and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next  as well as in the lives of everyone involved  Has she done more harm than good A compulsively readable  emotionally immersive  Hitchcockian thriller that draws comparisons to Gone Girl  The Silent Wife  or Before I Go to Sleep  this is an electrifying debut embraced by readers across markets and categories My Review  I absolutely loved this book  It was very hard to put it down  I was so engrossed with trying to solve the crime  Any character could have committed it  I was definitely surprised with the ending   Wow  What a page turner    Full of suspense  Couldn t put it down until I finished it   Oh man I loved this book It was so interesting  and for an adult novel   which I don t normally read   I really enjoyed it I m either really gullible  or its done well  but it had me guessing all the time The main protagonists aren t very likeable  But strangely I ended up somewhat liking them   I guess I m very sadistic in that way haha But definitely a good read that I d recommend  I started this book around 7AM Thursday morning  I finished it at 11AM Friday morning  Brilliant  tense  electrifying  I was guessing and second guessing until the very end  I felt myself identifying with parts of each narrator and sympathizing and hating them in equal measure  I couldn t read this fast enough  and I am absolutely dying to get my hands on everything Paula Hawkins writes from here on out  I read this book partially as a Girl on the Train  and it was an incredible experience from beginning to end  After reading a lot of good things about this book  including a positive tweet from Stephen King  I was dying to read it  But  so was everyone else in San Diego county  so I resigned myself to spot 908 on the library s hold list  Amazingly  I walked into the library a few days ago and saw  The Girl on the Train  sitting right there on the  new book  shelf  I grabbed it and hid it under my other pick ups  hoping spots 1 907 wouldn t see me with it  You know those Dear Abby stories about  pennies from Heaven   I periodically get books from Somewhere  Just last month as I was walking through the library my eye caught a small paperback on the 50 cent please get rid of these books shelf  It was Thomas Harris   Black Sunday   The only Thomas Harris book I haven t read  and as it s rather obscure I was surprised to find it waiting for me  It s nice to have a literary guardian angel watching out for you Anyways  I loved  The Girl on the Train   So it goes  Rachel takes the train into London every day  At a signal stop  she gazes at her favorite house where her favorite couple  Jason and Jess live  She sees them drinking coffee on the terrace every morning and fantasizes about their lives  personalities and relationship  One day  she sees  something bad   She gets terribly involved in these strangers lives  and it begins to consume her own  Of course  things are never as they seem in this book  We go back and forth from the POV of the three affected women  but primarily Rachel   as well as through 2012 through 2013  Instead of free flowing  each dated entry is broken into Morning  Afternoon and Evening  which I thought I would dislike  but ended up appreciating  This is a proper thriller  fast paced and imminently readable  A study of relationships  how well do you actually know the people in your life  and do you truly know what they are capable of  And furthermore  can you trust your own memories and instincts Read along  continuing on the British streak  I m reading my first Nick Hornby novel   How to be Good    intense read  I could not put it down  Rachel sits on a train  drinking gin and tonic from a can and making up stories about the couple she sees when her train stops at a signal   Jess and Jason  in her little fantasy  All very simple  except that there s three more cans in her bag to drink on this commute  the couple s house is only three houses down from Rachel s old house where her ex now lives with his new wife and baby  and Rachel s life is a bit of a mess  And then one night she tries to go see her ex husband after one too many bottle of wine  She wakes up the next morning with scarce recollection of the night before  and in the paper learns that  Jess  has disappeared  and she has a nagging feeling that she has the key information needed to uncover what s happened  but what does she know  what has she mis remembered  and what has she only dreamed   This is a challenging and very satisfying novel  It has much of the typical murder mystery and yet is written in a sophisticated way that kept me going thru a complex plot with multiple characters  The time line of the novel is noted in the text  It would be useful to keep track of the dates in order to understand the action   Add this to your Wish List  Now  This will be one of the  It  books of 2015  I read this book all in one day  because I could not put it down  I even cooked family dinner while reading   Family dinner wasn t pretty   As Rachel rides the train every day  she looks out the window at the houses that she passes  At one particular house  she sees the same couple  day after day  sitting on their porch  drinking coffee  She begins to imagine their life and even makes up names for them  As she imagines their perfect life  one day she sees something that startles her  The women is kissing someone that is not her husband  Take your shower early  put your dinner in a Crock Pot  and put your phone on silent  This is the beginning of a twisty  exciting and suspenseful ride I received this ARC from First to Read  The worth of a book is to be measured by what you can carry away from it   James Bryce This is an exceptional story that hit home with me  I needed this book  it has made me think and therefore it will change my life  I am so thankful I stepped outta my normal genre to read this one  No wonder it is on Amazons Best Seller list Now the story is based in London so my narrator s had british accents   I loved Them  There were three narrator s for the ladies and they did a great job  Well Anna s narrator was stiff in the beginning  she just read with no feeling  But thankfully she warmed up  I  it and Highly recommend it  I loved this book  We ve got three POVs and they vary in degrees of unreliability as far as narration goes  Rachel  a pathetic drunk who I was rooting for as I read her struggles  Every time she stumbled  my heart broke for her  I enjoyed her time on the train as she looked out at the lives along the tracks  Then there s Megan  who really challenged my ability to like her at first  And Anna  who I loathed for the greater part of the story  I could not put it down  literally  I was bumping into walls going about my day because I was reading  Contrary to some reviews  it s not  the next Gone Girl    It wasn t anything like Gone Girl  unless you count that it s a book and its a mystery  It s a who whydunnit and I enjoyed it all the way up to the reveal  There s a bit of a monologue info dump toward the end  but with this kind of story  that s almost unavoidable and it doesn t take away from my 5 star review  I know this is vague but with a mystery  I like to be careful about spoilers   HOLY  CRAP  Paula Hawkins is good   left me wondering who did it up until the very end  The whole time I seriously thought any of 5 people could have done it  Huge plot twist   something I didn t see coming  I was kind of able to put some of the pieces together but I surely doubted myself  I know there are some murder mystery books where you can usually spot  who done it  early on but this one kept me guessing for chapters  So good   two thumbs up   I can t say more because I don t want to ruin it  But  READ THIS BOOK  I m now a big fan of Paula Hawkins   Page TurnerCouldn t put it down  It s 2 20 am  and I have to be up at 7 30  but I had to finish I read this in a couple of days  I actually would have read it faster  but I m also reading 2 other books  It is really gripping  In this case  I really liked the fact that the story was told from the points of view of all three main female protagonists  Comparison to Gone Girl  No  Only in the fact that there were many twists and turns throughout the book  The plot was totally different  The setting was totally different  The characters were not at all the same  Isn t  edge of your seat  what you want  Stop comparing it to anything else  and start reading it  Could not put it down  Excellent just a real edge of your seat story  Highly recommended to anyone who likes mystery  thrillers  psychological intrigue  It has you guessing until the very absolute last second  What a ride  I really enjoyed The Girl on the Train  It was a very interesting story with so many turns and twist  it was hard to put the book down  I enjoyed how the author connected all the characters  stories over the period of a few months to reveal the climax of the book  I was angry at Rachel one minute and sympathizing with her the next  At times I thought   Come on Rachel get it together   or  I see why Tom did      In the end  I realize that although she made bad decisions she was struggling with very real and all to common problems   A real page turnerEvery one of the main characters in this book is not what they seem  With lots of craziness evident in the behavior of several of them  it soon becomes clear why a psychiatrist is a central character But nothing is simple or easily explained  The original premise of a young woman watching a couple in their back yard as her commuter train goes by daily and imagining their life together quickly turns into a complicated involvement into those lives  With a haze of alcoholism clouding her memories and her judgements  she becomes dangerously entangled before she is able to figure out who is truly evil This story kept me on the edge of my seat and I predict it will have the same effect on most readers  A fun thriller set outside London  told from the POV of three different women  all of whom are completely unreliable  Reminded me a bit of Gone Girl Summary from library catalog Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning  Every day she rattles down the track  flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes  and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck  She s even started to feel like she knows them   Jess and Jason   she calls them  Their life as she sees it is perfect  Not unlike the life she recently lost  And then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough  Now everything s changed  Unable to keep it to herself  Rachel offers what she knows to the police  and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next  as well as in the lives of everyone involved  Has she done more harm than good  Compulsively readable  The Girl on the Train is an emotionally immersive  Hitchcockian thriller and an electrifying debut  Do you imagine other people lead lives packed with adventure and happiness because they look good on the outside  I do  The premise of this book fascinated and tantalized me from the opening scene Each day  Rachel takes the train to work in London  At one of the regular stops along the way  she studies the houses beside the track  Over time  she invents a story about the people who live there  She often spies a handsome young couple eating breakfast on the terrace  and names them Jess and Jason  Like dolls in a dollhouse  Jason and Jess lead the perfect carefree life Only it s not true As the tangled web of secrets and lies in her own life unravels  Rachel inserts herself into this fantasy world  The complex plot moves with a plodding certainty  revealing an increasingly horrid truth  a truth I didn t see coming  Nothing is as it seems  The chilling conclusion is masterfully written This very well constructed mystery is told in the first person from three quite different viewpoints  The characters are well drawn and intriguing  although there s not a mentally healthy person in the whole story  The craziness and surprising connections between them adds dimension and sparkle  For a debut novel  this one is special  I m looking forward to Paula Hawkins  next offering  4 5 StarsI went in to this book with little idea what it was about and I would suggest this is the best way with thrillers  just go for it The Girl On the Train falls into the thriller mystery category and I could hardly put it down  The story begins during a seemingly normal week for our key character  Rachel  She commutes daily to London and has grown to know the train route like the back of her hand  Then something changes and immediately Rachel knows something has gone wrong  She thinks that she can help  She becomes obsessed in solving this mystery Over the course of the book we follow a missing persons case and the finger is pointed at nearly every character  so you re really kept on your toes  What also keeps you guessing is the multiple perspectives this book gives you  Rachel  Megan and Anna are our 3 protagonists  Rachel is the most heavily featured POV though   This makes the book a really quick read Now character wise  I would go as far as to say that there is not one character that is likeable and this was actually quite refreshing  The reader can never be sure who has a clean slate or who is a compulsive liar  It s full of messed up characters who have so many flaws  The only thing I didn t enjoy was sometimes Rachel s chapters seemed a little repetitive   just a cloudy overview of the same moment in time with little added clarity  By about page 250 I thought I had this mystery solved and then BAM  it came hurtling towards me and hit me so suddenly  I was so wrong with my conclusion and in a way I was glad that I was  I was so satisfied with the conclusion this novel came to and I will definitely be on the look out for any more of Paula Hawkins  novels  This novel has apparently been selected to be made in to a film and I think it has amazing potential  A few things about this book    I loved this book    The main narrator  Rachel  is a MESS  Talk about unreliable narrators      Although I thought the book had a tone and topic similar to Gone Girl  I didn t find it to be redundant or distracting This story revolves around Rachel  a divorced  alcoholic  depressed mess do a woman who rides a train into London everyday to a job that she lost months ago  The train happens to pass by her ex husband s backyard and that of a neighbor  Rachel passes her time vicariously living through the relationship she imagines the neighbors to have  When Rachel witnesses something in the backyard of the neighbors  house and the wife then disappears  Rachel finally has a reason to get up each day  She inserts herself Into the mystery which leads to chaos for her and everyone involved  Is Rachel right on her assumptions or is she hallucinating through drunken spells  It s a fun and surprising ride to find it all out  excellent  Loved it  Loved it loved it loved it It s no secret  I love psychological thrillers and I personally believe this one deserves all the hype  It s getting compared to Gone Girl quite a lot and while I usually hate it when books do that  in this case I feel it was quite appropriate  I also loved Gone Girl  in case that isn t clear   No complaints from me   Cannot WAIT for the film to be released   Video review  https   youtu be uDPkAiH1xis  The Girl on the Train   written by Paula Hawkins is a book that I could not put down  It is a book that takes place constantly changing between the three perspectives of three women named Rachel Watson  Anna  and Megan  The lives of these women do collide with each other  but not always in a positive way  This book is a hands down thriller kind of book and is hard hitting with suspense and action  even though half of the time  the pacing is quick and you may have no idea what is taking place next  or at the moment  Rachel is an unhappy ex wife  who drinks away her pain in which her ex husband  Tom  has begun a new family with a woman he was seeing  Bet you can t guess who  Well  it was Anna  Rachel s memory is frequently clogged and fogged due to her  blind drinking   She gets up some days and gets on the train frequently  and passes by some houses  On her trip  she always tends to see this happy couple on the balcony of their home  as they may appear  Rachel  in her mind  labels them Jess and Jason  and loves the way they re so happy and the  perfect couple   This  perfect couple  is Megan and Scott Hipwell  who are neighbors with Tom and Anna  These three character s stories and points of views constantly collide  and everything seems to be flowing along  even Rachel s depression   until something terrible happens to the ideal couple  and it is Rachel who begins to look around for clues  and tries to remember  I definitely recommend picking up this book  But be careful  you may not be able to put it back down  I hope you enjoy this story  especially to those suspense packed readers   Saw it coming at some point but wasn t sure  I still thought it was very well written and kept my attention  As far as the characters  while they were not likable characters  for the most part I still felt for them  Very glad I was not disappointed  great book  Sensacional  No es romance pero me engancho desde el principio  La intriga de saber que paso te hace no querer parar de leer  Lo recomiendo mucho  This book is just unbelievably amazing  i cant even describe how much i loved the ending  The whole book was fascinating  and well written   Even though i was listening to the audiobook    4 5 Stars   Something bad happened   Honestly  my heart is still racing  Those last few chapters were intense  I will try to review properly later  but this is fairly popular book  so my laziness may win over     Wow  This book blew me away  I enjoyed this book  I don t usually read mysteries because I don t like violence in detail  so if you don t like the gore but want something that keeps you guessing this is the book for you  My mom and I listened to this book on audio as we made the long grueling drive from Texas to Florida  I was hoping for a little distraction at best but audio books usually leave me thinking about everything in the world in my head then having to rewind them every few seconds because I ve drifted off again  What I got was utter immersion into the lives of Rachel  Anna  and Megan  The characters were written so well  All three were awful but you also felt for them and understood why they were the way they were  This book kept you guessing the whole time  My mom and I would pause it to discuss theories  We couldn t wait to get back in the car to drive more and discover more clues  At the end I ate a whole bag of sunflower seeds as I sat on the edge of my seat gripping the steering wheel  Haunting  Creepy  Disturbing  Mystery  Misery  Yet real life  Messy  Unbelievable  Lying  Cheating  Absolute perfection  It made me only want to read thrillers  It s one I will re read in actual print to pick apart the clues and enjoy it all over again  If you liked Gone Girl  you ll love The Girl on the Train  You should probably start this on a weekend  especially if you want to get sleep and or not smack yourself in the face by dropping the book on your head while trying to stay up and read  Gripping and twisty turny in the best way    The Girl on the Train sounds like it could be the long lost fourth Stieg Larson novel  Instead  it s a brilliant thriller by former financial writer and current New York Times bestselling author Paula Hawkins   The novel was released earlier this year and hit the literary world like  if you ll pardon the pun  a runaway train  Rachel rides the commuter train to and from work five days a week  Even when she gets fired from her job for being a drunk  she continues the daily commute just to keep appearances up  Her routine doesn t change  She stares out the window  gulps wine or gin and tonics  loathes herself  and tries not to look when  every morning and every night  she passes by her old house and her old life  Her husband has re married  to a woman he started seeing when he and Rachel were still together  There s a baby now  and the beautiful little girl somehow puts an exclamation point on everything Rachel lost   A few doors down  she notices a new couple  They re young  attractive and obviously very much in love  Rachel often sees them in their yard or on their small terrace  She fantasizes about them  creating names  occupations and all the different aspects of a storybook marriage  She s into the arts  He s a world traveler  Together  they ve got the world on a string  Then  that woman disappears and is later found dead  Rachel believes she may have witnessed something that led to a brutal murder  She contacts police but her drinking issues  cloudy memory and history of harassing her former husband and his new bride make Rachel s claims less than credible  She s still convinced she can help but can t quite remember what she saw or what it might mean  Meanwhile  that old demon alcohol is never far away   Because of poor eyesight  I ve been an avid audio book listener for well over thirty five years  I consider myself an expert on the subject  As a general rule  I don t care for books with more than one narrator  I find that style of production tends to be distracting and sometimes confusing  In the case of The Girl on the Train  however  that approach is perfect  There is a different narrator for each of the three primary female characters  The story is told from those three points of view and each has its own voice  literally  All three narrators are excellent  and their performance contributes to what s already a fantastic novel   What a bunch of crazy people in this book  Very suspenseful thriller  I really liked the story and definitely did not guess correctly about who was ultimately involved in the murder  I was confused in the beginning because I was focusing so much on the dates of each chapter that I never saw the names of who was narrating each one  Pay attention to that   Lol  I also really enjoyed the writing  which was based in another country  because of the differences in spelling and language  For example color is spelled colour and yogurt is yoghurt  The trunk of a car is called the boot and a fight is a riff  There are so many differences that I always find fascinating   I think I forgot to breathe while reading the ending  I m pretty sure I suspected every character at least once   That s what the fuss was all about  Wow  This book is a breath of fresh air  I just love psychological books  It really is mind blowing  I love it s format  the characters and the plot  To me  it s better than Gone Girl  an easier read  I was on the edge of my seat for the parts  Thankfully  I did like the ending  At one point I thought the ending would be a mind fuck  That Anna would stick with Tom and she would gloat at the facts that Rachel would be out of their lives forever  Although all the female characters are ridiculously insane  Thank goodness they do have some sanity left  I would throw a fit had the ending been different  My only quibbles are the annoyingly confusing shift of tenses  I m used to reading straight past or present tense  but this one is different  I have to reread and dissect the author s style  Another issue is I just didn t like the way Tom recounted the incident to the ladies  I think it s superfluous  Overall  it s amazing  Excellent job Paula Hawkins  I just don t understand some readers berating the book  Some people just don t get it  I m sometimes hesitant to read a book that everyone is reading and talking about  I think because I worry there s no way it will be as good as the buzz around it  I also wasn t planning to read The Girl on the Train because I kept hearing it was the next Gone Girl  a book that I didn t like and actually abandoned  which I hardly ever do   Then I picked this book up at the library on a whim  and once I started reading  I couldn t put it down  The story is told from three different female perspectives  Rachael  Megan  and Anna  and what a great read it is  This book is expertly plotted  fast paced  and the final twist is so perfect  and I m happy to report that I saw it coming    This will make a great movie even if I already know how it ends  I m anxious to see how Hawkins follows up on her very entertaining and successful debut novel  Thank you friend for recommending the book  You know who you are  LOL  At first I had trouble getting into the book because of the hot mess of characters and trying to follow their logic  However it all came together for me in the middle of the book and from there I couldn t put it down  It was a great read  Twist and turns you don t expect  It is Criminal Minds vs  Emotional Connections  Gotta love the mystery of how it unfolds   Read the full review  http   wp me p3J9eI m4I ve heard mixed reviews of this book but I  for one  got exactly what I wanted from it  The story speeds up and slows down just like the train would do at each stop  and at each stop of the story  more options come in for a possible ending  a new possible line for the story to go down  and more options are dismissed  Like Rachel  you don t exactly know what s going on at all times  and like waking up with a really bad hangover  you re frantically trying to figure out what happened That feeling though  usually means the night before was INCREDIBLE though and so was The Girl on the Train  Brutal  Hasta el ultimo parrafo   LClachicadeltren I love an unreliable narrator  Really makes things cloudy  unpredictable  and ultimately fun  This entire thing read as so authentic  I was especially impressed that all of the narrative voices were distinct  compelling and authentic  At times I wanted to scream at Rachel  You IDIOT  WHY are you making such CRAPPY decisions      but didn t we all  The suspense and mystery of the events were never lost on me and there were numerous interesting twists and shadings in different directions  This is a good  good read  I miss my Blencheim people already  Highly recommend this read  Deals with trauma  memory  and trusting your gut  Recommend  Finally a mystery I didn t figure out in the first fifty pages  I couldn t stop reading  This book was so not how I had expected to be  The part that I expected to be really major like what she sees on the train did not go as planned  I thought that what she saw on the train would be way more horrifying than merely seeing a women cheat on her husband  This lead me off course to just tie up the ends together already and say that the husband must have something to do with her missing because he has a motive  But as I kept reading and reading  things started to unfold bit and bit and the ending was never what I imagined  I was so shocked and creeped out by Tom that he can be so psychologically twisted  I read this book in less than 7 hours and it was all worth it  I kept turning the pages and my fingers just weren t able to stop flipping another page  I am really happy with this even though usually I wouldn t like a book that s as tame as this book  The ending made it all worth it   OMG  OMG  OMG  OMG  This book was FANTASTIC  I listened to the audio version  The narrators of Rachel and Megan were fantastic  Anna was okay  not bad but not as good as the others   It was a bit confusing as there were three POVs and they were on different timelines but it was not too hard to follow  Reading the book instead of listening to it may be better due to that but I do recommend the audio Many have compared it to Gone Girl  It was similar but so much more  More suspenseful  More thrilling  Darker  It gave me  the feels  but not good  feels   I was anxious reading it  There were many times I had to stop listening because I could not handle it  I needed to break away from the book and breathe  All three main characters narrators were so damaged  I do not think there was a single character that was not a horrible person  minus the psychologist but even he was not perfect   No one was who what they seemed I highly recommend this book  Especially if you like thrillers  Mysteries  It was an amazing book  Good novel to read at the beach  kept me hooked even when I figured out the ending  Move on  Gone Girl   there s a new bad girl in town Pilna atsauksme bloga https   gramatas wordpress com 2015 0    A very good readThis book kept me interested from beginning to the end  I was constantly engaged with where the plot was taking me  The three ladies telling their respective stories was fascinating  It was like looking into the journals of an actual alcoholic seeing her struggles each day when reading about Rach  When she made the decision to see the psychiatrist I wanted to scream into my kindle and say no you are making a mistake  But when she got there and actually told the truth getting the help she needed I was elated  I was completely in love with this character  When Rach and Anna bonded together to rid themselves of such a horrific situation I wanted to cheer  This was a very good book  Wow    Simplemente wow  Una historia que me engancho desde el primer momento  No quiero comentar mucho de que va el libro  pero lo recomiendo 100  si te gustan las novelas negras  Las ultimas 100 paginas fue como ir en un tren con todos estos personajes  no podia parar de leerlo mientras me acercaba al final  Sin duda un libro que se perfila en uno de los mejores que he leido este ano 2015    If you re prone to anxiety  as I am  this one will give you a heart attack  I d get to a particularly difficult part and have to put the book down and walk away for a few hours then return because I was so intrigued  Good stuff  A must read for suspense readers   When I first started this book I wasn t sure if I d like the format or style it was written in  It goes back and forth through the daily lives and thoughts of the main characters but it didn t take long to get caught up in it   Rachel rides the commuter train in the morning and the evening daily  Along her route she watches the houses and the people who live within them making up stories about their lives  One day she notices a change at her favorite couples house which turns into a missing persons case  Rachel throws herself into the middle and along with her involvement with the house down the street leads us into a interesting and unexpected web of intrigue and lies I could not put this one down and will be watching to see what Paula Hawkins will come out with next  Highly recommend for those who loved Gone Girl   Attention grabbing and hard to put down  but not surprised by endingThis book was a little slow to start  but it picked up pace and held my interest as the story began to unfold  It had some really screwed up characters  with some really sad issues  Unfortunately  there was no happy ending and to my dismay  I was able to predict exactly where things were headed  I would have preferred a little more of a shocker  But overall  a good book  wish it left me with a happier feeling  This was a fun and quick read  Very well written too  Hope to read her again  Her storytelling is somewhat like Lianne Moriarty  Wow   what a ride  Lots of twists and twisted characters  A quick read because it is hard to put down   Great who done it  had me guessing till the end  Reminded me of the book  Sister  by Rosamund Lupton  FABULOUS book   and a great ending I didn t even see coming   even though I knew that it was a twist   This book was awesome  I blew through it in 48 hours and could not put it down  The story was was told from 4 different view points and had many hooks and turns  all the way until the end  This book was said to be 2015 s next  Gone Girl    I couldn t agree more  I loved it   definitely recommend it   fabulous book   Lots of comparisons made to Gone Girl    but I liked this one MUCH more   This was just good fun  It was intriguing until 1 3 into the book and then it drew me in and became very hard to put down  All the characters are very believable and there were twists and turns and bumps that were just very well done  I thought  Thoroughly enjoyable   This book was an tighter  faster moving  more interesting version of Gone Girl  I loved that book  I liked this one even more  Set just outside London  the author really captures the feeling and look of the area close to where my family lived for several years  The characters  like those of Gone Girl  are not sympathetic  but they are a bit more fleshed out  By the end of the book I was trying to turn pages before I d finished reading and I was genuinely surprised by the reveal  If I had any criticism  it is that the moving viewpoints between the characters and difference in timelines can be a little confusing at times  but that is a small complaint  I highly recommend this book  Loved it  just like Gone Girl  Addicted right away  easy reading  I could not put it down  I was disappointed when I saw the reviews compared it to  Gone Girl   but reading this book was so much better than my experience with  Gone Girl   which I never finished   I read  The Girl on the Train  in one day  The twists and turns kept me having to reevaluate my theories and just when I thought I had it figured out  another twist  I Loved It   The Girl On The Train is a book that sinks it s claws into you and holds on  As the story progresses it gets harder and harder to put down  The story is told from three different perspectives  three separate stories that seamlessly become one  The author s layout of scene and character descriptions is captivating  Sometimes Rachel is so absorbed in her self loathing that her reasoning for her actions sets you on edge because how could she make such idiotic decisions  be so naive  Three different women  three different personalities  all fooled  The ending was full of suspense  forcing me to read on until 2 A M  when I finally finished  There were questions left unanswered like what about the cell phone and where was the followup to the case  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves an on the edge of your seat book  Thoroughly enjoyed this book  I liked how you got to see things from 3 main characters perspectives throughout the book  Nice twist at the end  Very captivating   A great page turner Written in the style of  Gone Girl    this story had you thinking that you knew who was the killer but only to change to another suspect   This book kept you guessing throughout  It was intriguing to keep peeking into the different perspectives of the women as the story progressed  Very enjoyable to read   I read this book very quickly   could not put it down  It s kind of like  Gone Girl  but so MUCH BETTER    I enjoyed this book a lot  The book kept me guessing until three quarters through the book  I slightly see why it is compared to Gone Girl  but I believe that was probably originally done for marketing the book  This book was another  can t put this down  kinda book  I loved the way it switched narrators to give you different perspectives of the same situations  It kept me wondering and thinking  and while I suspected the outcome a little before it was revealed  I did wonder  hmmmmmm  maybe not  until it was confirmed  This was a fantastic read for me  It s been a while since I ve felt so disturbed after reading a book  Haunting  yes  Definitely  The book is written in a few of the main characters  point of view  Sort of like a journal  Just a mash up of entries by the characters  In the beginning  it feels tedious  lengthy  long winded  and wearisome and you start to wonder  how many ways can the same story be told  There were a few chapters where I was reading without actually bothering to make out what I was reading  because I felt that the story wasn t progressing  it s still telling the same tale from page one  But as I continue reading  I realised that the story has been developing and I suddenly lost track because I wasn t concentrating  I wasn t really reading it  I find myself flipping backwards to take note of the date in which each event is happening  In each chapter  you get a sliver of new information which you need to digest to fully grasp the full story  The chapters or  journal entries  were arranged not in chronical order  but in the order where you slowly get pieces of the puzzle to entice you to continue reading to the end where you can finally see the full picture  and when you do get to the end  your heart would be thumping  Traditional psychological thriller  The writing is good enough for you to imagine the scene  as if you re watching it  A little upset about the ending but it s not disappointing  Just upset for the characters and I wish I could do something for them  To help or to comfort them For fans of Gone Girl definitely How would I rate this book  101  must read   This was a riveting novel that kept me intrigued from start to finish  In brief  alcoholic Rachel  divorced and jobless  rides the train to London daily pretending she is still employed  As she passes the station she used to live with her ex  Tom  she spies on a neighbor  finally seeing her with a lover    when the woman is reported as missing  she contacts the police and becomes an integral part of the investigation and drama  A thriller   Okurken sonunu tahmin edemedigim bir kitap oldu   WOW   I usually don t like  popular  books or modern tales   but this one was amazing  after i read it i told everyone i knew about it  my stepmom and sister also read it and loved it  i LOVED how fast paced it was  her chapters are from different character s perspectives which i always love  She also seems to write so  real   i believed everything that was happening  and I can totally relate to seeing something every day and making up your own story in your head of how it is  i couldn t put this book down and I am not one of those readers who can read for hours at a time   i get too sleepy   I think i finished this one in less than a week  and the TWISTS at the end  i never expected  LOVED IT  I will check out more books from this author  Read this in one sitting  Today  Nothing really productive happened this weekend    This one kept me guessing until the last 30 or so pages  Great thriller  I ve just finished reading this book and I feel like I need a lie down  Even though I had my suspicions about  whodunnit  I think I was holding my breath with nerves for most of the last few chapters  and through quite a few of the earlier ones too   What a brilliant read  a proper thriller  This is going straight onto my favourites shelf and I reckon I can say  with certainty  that this book will be in my Top 10 reads of 2015 at the end of the year   Originally posted on This Chick Reads Copy provided by publisher in exchange for an honest review OK   The Girl on the Train  is simply   WOW  I know you ve heard a LOT about this book on social medias and I know for certain many of you are SO excited about this book  and here it is  The Girl on the Train is finally here and you have every right to be excited and not only that  you re totally allowed to run to the bookshop  grab a copy  and then run back home to devour this masterpiece of a thriller Yeah  this book is THAT good  It s one of the most talked about books of 2015 and one of those hyped books but with a reason  trust me  It s Paula Hawkins debut  but it certainly doesn t feel like a debut  It s utterly fabulous  gripping  atmospheric read  which will make you wonder and question  and wonder some more It starts with Rachel going on her regular commute  living a somewhat normal life  gazing though the train s window and observing people around her  Sometimes she even makes up stories around them  imagining their lives  what they had for tea  if they are happy  what are their names  Seeing them so often through the window makes her feel like she s already part of their lives  but at the same time in a bit of a bizarre way almost like a voyeur  However  some things happen  some things which will even make Rachel question her sanity  pulling her in a story where she s no longer an observer but taking an active role  And that s when things get really crazy and very very intense both for Rachel and the reader  The narrative is so flawless  so genuine  so captivating  Ms Hawkins  writing will make you think you re in Rachel s head or she s in your head  or both  One of the many qualities this book undoubtedly possesses is the fact it feels very real and even if you don t want to connect to Rachel  who s really messed up  in a strange  bizarre way you will care deeply for her and root for her  I said Rachel is messed up  and oh she is  She s still trying to get through her divorce and come to terms with the fact her  now  ex husband moved on while she s still stuck  And there s alcohol involved  lots of it  At times I even wondered if some things really happened or they are just in Rachel s head  a product of her hangover or something  Which is point number TWO  why this book is so great  I don t think Ms Hawkins had the desire to create a character all of us will feel connected to  or some heartbroken 30ish woman with whom we could empathize  For many  Rachel could be even unlikable character  she s kind of weak  drained by all the misfortunes in her life and she has many flaws  the biggest being she s a heavy drinker  She s not strong enough to deal with her problem  despite the fact her flatmate is telling her she ll be forced to throw her out if she doesn t get her shit together  BUT  THE STORY  guys   it s that what matters  It really doesn t matter if Rachel was Ms Little Perfect or as f cked up as she is  the story is what is important and that is making this book so great Point number THREE  this book will make you think  Like  A LOT  Is everything what it seems  are we just mere observes of other people s lives  or we influence them to a certain extent  It also brings up the question  is the grass really greener on the other side  Will I be really happier if I were in Sue s shoes  Or what would happen if I was Jess  or Megan or whatever  And finally  when shit starts happening and we witness it  should we get involved or keep quiet  Though it seems sometimes we can avoid getting involved in some situations  most of the times we re simply caught up and we must do something about it  And as a rule  we re ALWAYS changed by these situations and the paths we choose to follow  And that  my dear friends  is what this book is about As you see  I really really LOVED this book  I know my review will not do it justice  as I know comparing it to Gone Girl is   let s say  not very good as I certainly enjoyed and loved this book more than Gone Girl  I can see a connection mostly in two things  both are psychological thrillers and Gone Girl WAS and still is one of the most read thrillers and books lately  but this is where the similarity ends  at least for me    The Girl on the Train  DESERVES to stand on its own and not be compared to Gone Girl or any other book published before  simply because it s STRONG enough to stand on its own I applaud to Ms Hawkins for creating this creepy yet beautiful  complex and layered story that will live with me forever  It s gripping and compelling read that you will read in one sitting  and though it s just January and it might be too early to say this  it s the IT book of 2015  Get ready guys  for you re about to go on a hell of a journey  Everyone  get aboard   MAY CONTAIN SPOILER The storyline in this book is just like a spiderweb  It seems complicated  it indeed is  but once you see the pattern it contains  you just fall in love with the big picture  The characters are human  completely evil trying to hide   mostly successfully  but in the end masks fall and the real faces reveal  The author must have worked too hard to create such characters who are too alike each other yet so different  I thought it would be nice if I actually wrote a proper review for this  rather than 3 words This book is extremely interesting  I was interested in the characters  lives along with the overall mystery The main character  Rachel  is an alchoholic who always sees this couple from her seat on the train and kind of imagines what their perfect looking life is like  until the woman in the couple goes missing  and Rachel becomes involved  and realizes that not everything is as perfect on the inside as it looks from the outside Although Rachel made some questionable choices  and is a little bit of an anti hero  I found her to be likable and her rage that she displays in certain parts of the book was understandable  She s really a mess and I m happy I m not dealing with a perfect character There are also passages from the girl who goes missing leading up to her disappearance  making it much more interesting to try and figure out This has a lot to do with darker subjects  this isn t a totally light book  and might not be for those people that don t like reading more depressing stories I did figure out the ending a little bit before it was actually revealed  but that may have been done on purpous  Overall  it was one of those books that takes a lot of effort to put down  I ll totally be reading any other book this author writes  Sure did not guess the end  Very good read  I started this book with some hesitation concerned that it would be a rip off of Gone Girl  While there are some similarities  mainly the narrative coming from different characters  perspectives   it ended up being a real page turner  It was a little slow at the beginning getting traction  a quarter way thru I couldn t put it down   Voyeuristic mindfuck page turner  lots of backwards page turning too  love that feeling   wait oh my god  how did she just say that  I thought     flips backwards  re reads  WHOA     These are not good people  they are not doing good things  but the author sure does make their collective story fascinating  Both the men and women are painted with awfully similar strokes of the brush  but their motivations are different enough to make them pop off the page  Hope you don t know too many people in your life like these folks    cuz if you do  you better watch yo back  I found this book to be a fun read  I didn t want to stop reading it and found the character portrayal very realistic  Everyone is a mess  alcoholism described brilliantly  a new level of the  crazy  female who turns out to be the most sane   Saya menyukai buku ini karena karakter dari pemeran utama di buku ini  Penulis dapat menggambarkan karakter seorang wanita yang dihianati dan patah hati  Sehingga sebagai seorang wanita saya juga dapat merasakannya  Dengan alur cerita yang mengejutkan dan latar belakang sebuah kota kecil yang dilalui kereta  saya sangat menikmati membaca buku ini  Dan dalam watu dua hari saya bisa menyelesaikannya  Buku ini adalah buku psychological thriller terbaik yang pernah saya baca dan saya sangat merekomendasikan buku ini untuk dibaca   Most twisted characters I ve read about since Gone Girl  It s a on the edge of your seat page turner  Can t get any better than that  I can t get my head around the fact that there are people who actually hated this book  Some of them even labeled the characters in this book  underdeveloped  but I tell you  they are so far from being correct  This is the first time that I greatly admired a book that is full of tragedies  The supreme writing of Paula Hawkins made me  a bachelor who s still earning his degree in Physics  to actually  feel  the conflicting emotions of the characters  To me  they are real  They are breathing  They are not just some people who were just a product of pen or keyboard  They are alive  The alternate perspectives of the three women gave me a bird s eye view of what was happening  The writing was so smooth until the end and I think no words throughout the novel seemed misplaced  The plot was great and the revelation at the end was heart pounding  Honestly  this is the kind of book that you will feel extreme pity to the characters  But it doesn t mean it makes it less great  Read it  This book it BRILLIANT   It s everything Gone Girl should have been   great plot  excellent twists  enjoyable  not in the least bit irritating narrative  There were moments when I held my breath  gasped out loud   SUCH a good read  I finished it in 2 days and cannot stop telling people how brilliant it is  Read it read it read it   As a wise woman once said  I really enjoyed this book and had a hard time putting it down  There so many twists and turns that left me wanting more  The story took a turn that I didn t see coming  I picked this book up at Barnes and Noble on Sunday night  and I ve been reading it compulsively since I started  I m beginning to find that I enjoy adult novels more than I expected  I found it very unique the way the story is told  For starters  it is written similarly to a diary  but different in the way that its is told from the perspective of three different women  and the date of the events occurring are sporadic  Personally I found that the events in the story fall together beautifully  Around the middle of the novel  I started to think back on the quotes placed in the front of the book  I was curious to know why they were placed there and how they pertain to the story  Now  having finished the novel  I think of those quotes quite often  It s reassuring when I think of how clever it was of Hawkins to do that  However  the quotes themselves send a chill down my spine    I can t help but love it  Paula Hawkins is an amazing writer and I m definitely going to be picking up another one of her novels in the near future   Like a train slowly pulling out of a station  the novel s pace begins in that fashion before reaching a dizzying breakneck speed with a compelling plot and exceptionally flawed and utterly engaging characters  all of whom are suspects and none of whom are truly innocent  The plot  however  is a mere driving force for the many disparate themes Hawkins explores  though I give her great credit for fooling me until near the very end  which most thrillers fail to do   The most fascinating character is Megan  who has the fewest chapters among the three women narrators as her story comes to a boil  She encapsulates the suburban ennui felt by all three characters  though she exercises far more agency in her attempt to escape the banality of modern life  Rachel becomes a victim and falls prey to alcoholism  while Anna uses a thrilling affair to enter into that boring life that she now desperately wants to protect   Megan s deep secret caused her too to create for herself this stultifying life  then succumbs to deep anger for this polite civility with irrational fears and neuroses  not least among them feeling a loss of control that comes from relying upon others  that can only be relieved by expressing sexual power over men  she very tellingly admits to desperate desires for her husband when he is away  an even more desperate desire to push him away when he is present  The tone is excellent  there are a few red herrings  and the ultimate resolution is satisfying  as Megan ultimately concludes that dismissal is worse than rejection  Isn t that always the way of those who create drama to relieve their boredom   I want them to make this into a movie because I want everyone to enjoy this fast paced  whodunnit drama thriller  I know  though  that if they turn it into a movie  it ll probably suck ass  So please don t ruin this fabulous book It s a book about three women  each chapter told from their perspective  Alcoholic  unemployed  frumpy  barren  divorced Rachel  Anna  the beautiful mistress turned wife to Rachel s charming and handsome ex husband  living in Rachel and Tom s house  and mother to their child  Megan  the mysterious and beautiful young woman who lives down the street  married to Scott  a man she fears yet loves deeply  a former gallery owner with a closet filled with more skeletons than you could shake a stick at One of them is murdered but by whom This book is an intensely fast paced  well written  beautifully created book  You genuinely care for the characters in this book and wonder if you  yourself  are beginning to fall down the rabbit hole with one of the main characters  It took 8 hours to read this book and I didn t want to put it down  Such a great book  I was all over the place trying to decide who the killer was  And I love the message that things aren t always what they seem  As humans  we are story tellers  So  it s so easy to check out a relationship or a person from far away and start telling ourselves these amazing stories about them   and then start to compare ourselves to this person  our relationship to this relationship  And  as always  I love characters that are multidimensional and complex  Man  the author really did an excellent job of setting the tone and atmosphere  like I really could feel the darkness  the depression  the bleakness of the spot Rachel was in  I hope she writes another book  Suspenseful and compelling  Just when you think you ve met the most horrible person in the book  you re introduced to someone even worse  I loved hating these people   A very suspenseful and engaging bookI really enjoyed this book  It was engaging from the beginning   weaving the characters and their stories together  I feel that the pace picked up towards the middle of the book  and it was very difficult for me to put down  I liked the suspense  the ending wasn t predictable to me  and I really appreciated to fact that it had a definite ending  rather than leaving the reader hanging  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a good  sometimes twisted story line   Shades of Gone Girl and Gaslight  this is one nifty page turner of a thriller  Paula Hawkins has used the device of the unreliable narrative and lying narrator made famous by Gillian Flynn in her fantastically successful Gone Girl and used it with great ingenuity to tight and suspenseful effect  It was a very entertaining read This is the story of three women   Rachel  Megan  and Anna  Each of the three shares in the narration of the story and so we see it from three different perspectives  but as we near the denouement  we begin to comprehend that none of the narratives has been entirely true  Certainly  none of the three is complete in itself The woman who we first meet is that  girl on the train   She is Rachel  She takes the same commuter train to London every morning  allegedly to go to her job at a public relations firm  Only slowly is it revealed that she has actually lost her job because of her drinking three months before  She continues taking her daily trip to fool her flatmate whom she doesn t want to know about the job loss As Rachel takes her daily trip to and from London  she rolls by a stretch of cozy suburban homes  one of which she used to live in with her husband  Tom  She was blissfully happy there until alcohol took over her life and Tom strayed into the arms of another woman  Anna  Now  he and Anna live in the house that he and Rachel once occupied and as she goes by each day  Rachel looks down on the house and remembers She also observes a nearby house where a young couple  whom she has named Jason and Jess but who are actually Scott and Anna  live  Rachel sees them as happy and in love  the perfect young marrieds  The truth is very much more complicated than that  as we learn when we meet Megan through her narrative  One day as she is passing by  Rachel sees Jess  Megan  on her patio kissing another man who is not Jason  Scott  and she is shocked  Could she have been wrong about their lives She is even more shocked when she reads in the newspaper that the woman who lived at that address has disappeared without a trace   the day after she saw her kissing a man not her husband  Is there a connection While these events are happening  Rachel s life and her tentative hold on reality are unraveling completely  Her flatmate is fed up with her drinking and there is a black hole in her memory of the day that Megan disappeared  Rachel wakes the day after to find herself with unexplained injuries and unable to remember what happened  but she has a vague memory of being in the area where the woman disappeared Then the woman s body is found near the railroad tracks and Rachel is even more desperate to remember what happened during her blackout  She fears that she may be somehow involved in Megan s death Meanwhile  Anna is becoming fed up with Rachel and what she sees as her meddling in the lives of Anna  Tom  and their young daughter  She sees her as a stalker and a danger to her child Rachel  in an alcoholic haze  is torn about what she observed of Megan from the train and what she thinks she knows about her life and that of Scott and the unknown man on the patio  When she finally works up her courage to tell the police  they at first accept and investigate her statement but then reach the conclusion that her observations are not to be trusted because she is a drunk  She is humiliated once again This book has a lot of moving parts  but as we get near the end they all come together and take on the speed and force of a runaway locomotive  Paula Hawkins keeps all of the disparate lines of her complicated tale from becoming inextricably tangled and all the lies  innuendos  and threats eventually are revealed for what they are in a most satisfactory conclusion  It is a very impressive accomplishment  Wow  Just wow  Words are lost to me at the moment  I m having trouble processing exactly what went on in this book  the twists and turns that were both gripping and thrilling  The darkness of the story was at times so chilling that I had to just stop for a moment to process what I d just read  I was captured by this story from the start although saying that about 3 4 of the way through the book I had guessed who had done it  but overall I loved it  Every single page was gripping and I m so glad I picked it up   It s been a long time since I have sat and read a book in a day but wow this book gripped me   The storyline was thrilling and exciting and I couldn t wait to finish it to get to the bottom of the murder  It is written in such a way that you feel you know about the story from so many points of view and this gives the reader quite a lot of understanding  The characters were great and the plot definatley kept me guessing  It was more intriguing that the main character Rachel didn t quite know what had happened in the said incident but knew she was connected  That made me want to know more about what happened that night and how she was connected  Such a page turner  Definately recommend this book to anyone looking for a thriller or novel to get stuck into  Couldn t put it down all day   Wow  What an incredible book  I had read over and over again that this book was much like Gone Girl  but the general consensus was that the book The Girl on the Train was much better  Having read Gone Girl and having really disliked certain elements of that book  I decided to give this book a try  and wow  I am so glad that I did Rachel Watson s husband  Tom  has left her for another woman  Anna  and Rachel can t quite get over this  Everyday  she rides the train past the house they now share  but tries not to look at it and see their perfect life with their perfect marriage and their perfect baby girl  Instead  she focuses on another couple whom she s certain is perfect  She doesn t actually know the attractive couple who lives down the road from her ex  but she imagines names  histories  and lives for the pair  One day  however  she sees something horrifying that makes her rethink everything she thinks she knows about this couple  In the interconnected web that forms around Rachel  her ex  his new wife  and the mysterious couple  Hawkins creates a plot so thrilling that I couldn t stop reading from start to finish  I felt so many things through this book   discomfort  frustration  anxiety  hope   and a book that makes me feel quite so much is a book that I love  This is also a book that I have found myself recommending again and again  Just as everyone else had told me  this is a psychological thriller as the cover promises  and it is similar in ways to Gone Girl  but yes  it is SO MUCH BETTER  I couldn t put this book down  I wont give an overview of the story   but I will say it is economically written   no over blown  flowery descriptions   the author only uses words that are necessary to move the story forward   it s rapid paced and tense and the ending does not disappoint  It has been a long time since I ve read a contemporary book and felt satisfied with my purchase  I have heard it compared to Gone Girl   which I enjoyed but found the ending a little ridiculous   this is a head and shoulders above Gone Girl   So so so good  I read the majority in one day and couldn t put it down  Very interesting character study and I love the structure of the chapters  Incredibly gripping  This is a page turner  I read it in two days  I agree that it is not quite Gone Girl  but a very entertaining mystery  even though I figured it out   Truly a psychological thriller  You know you re hooked with the story when you look forward to the bus journey so you can read the book  I first saw the book at a hotel that we stayed in Hanoi  Some traveller must have left it there  I was hooked reading the first few pages  The book isn t a let down  It gives me the feel of Gone Girl so much  every character in the book has some kind of mental problem  Not gonna lie  I felt uneasy  on the verge of depression  during those days that i was reading the book  I felt frustrated  stuck  negative just as the main character  I think psychological thriller isn t doing me good  psychologically  But it is a darn thriller book  I didn t learn much from this book  aside the effect of alcohol and not to trust anyone   but it is a good book  I like the writing style  the pacing  the telling a story from different viewpoints and the twist  It plays with your mind too   Spoiler  You were so set on this person is the murderer or this person is absolutely innocent  until you find out it s the opposite   Spoiler   The Girl on the Train  is one of my favorite books of all time  An instant classic and for good reason  As a diehard fan of psychological thrillers  this book was absolutely riveting  heart breaking and completely took me by surprise  The cover is innocuous enough but within this book s pages lies some of the darkest yet most utterly human problems ever written  If you re a huge fan of  Gone Girl   as I am   you ll love the pacing and plot line of this book Rachel is one of the most flawed and unreliable narrators I ve ever read  yet her plight is utterly realistic and highly sympathetic  The abuse she suffers under the hands of Tom and her self abuse through alcoholism is maddening  yet we as readers can do nothing to help her  We watch her stumble through her blackouts  her addiction  her overwhelming loneliness and directionlessness   and we feel pity for her but at the same time fear that Rachel could really be any of us  she could be someone we know  someone we care about  She could be us   if we lost our jobs  our spouses  our home and our ability to have children Meg and Scott are really just secondary characters but they still manage to be complex  living  breathing enigmas  Scott chills me to the core and Megan  sweet Megan  is so deluded and aimless  Megan in some ways is Rachel s character foil  Anna is also Rachel s character foil and despite thinking she s completely different from Rachel  they ultimately realize they are barreling down the same dead end  pining after a sociopath and an emotionally manipulative husband  The ending nearly ripped my heart out and I my jaw was unhinged the entire time  I did not expect it at all  The second half of this novel will definitely take on some plot twists you won t see coming  This book kept me up late into the night and even after I finished it  I was too scared to fall asleep  You know it s an amazing book when it keeps your mind spinning long after you ve finished reading the last word I am extremely keen to read whatever Paula Hawkins writes next  She is an amazing and talented author and this is a mind blowing thriller I d recommend to anyone  Can I rate this 10 5 stars   I m a writer and I spend more than 12 hours in front of my computer writing  reading  and doing research  As you can imagine my eyes get too tired to add reading a lot of pages of a book at one sitting  Normally it takes weeks for me to finish a book of the length of The Girl on the Train  I finished The Girl on the Train in two afternoons  I really could not put it down  My eyes got tired  I felt dizzy from looking at my book  yet I kept reading to see what was coming next I didn t know anything about the book before I began reading  All I knew was it was a thriller and that it was a bestseller  I do believe not knowing anything about the story made the story just more fun for me  Which is also why I m not really reviewing the book s itself  If you haven t read anything about the book  don t do it now  just pass right to the book Extra kudos to the author for keeping the length of the book what it is  When I read a thriller  very often I find myself thinking the author had added too many unnecessary details and that it would have been better if it was 50 150 pages shorter  The Girl on the Train was one of the rare thrillers that made me think   This is it  Not longer or shorter than it should be   I will be surely getting the next book by Paula Hawkins  Ingenious  A rambling story about a pathetic alcoholic who can t seem to get her life on track  Wasted days and nights as she struggles in vain to regain what she lost  But faded memories return amidst her moments of sobriety as images form to recreate a hellish scenario of death and deception  Eventually finding the pieces of the puzzle she sets about righting past wrongs and in so doing destroys part of that she sought to regain  A skillfully crafted plot keeps the reader in suspense  A superb work highly recommended  There is a reason books reach the top ten list and this book is an excellent example  Once you start  you can t stop  the most cringe worthy but amazing  the turn of every event it s surprising  Highly recommended  You see this book everywhere  It makes you think  what s the fuss all about   I ll admit I was curious  I wanted to read it and find out if it really was that good IT IS IT IS THAT GOOD EVEN BETTER  MAYBE It fits exactly my definition of a good book  It s interesting  it surprised me      You can t put it down  you can t help it but read and read and keep Reading    The characters are flawed and you think  I m like that too  or  sometimes I feel the same thing  or  I would do exactly the same  If you haven t read it yet  I don t know what you re doing with your life Paula Hawkins  you understand people  Bless you  I absolutely loved this book  This book kept me guessing right up the end  I totally didn t see this book end the way it did  I will be recommending this book to all my friends  Loved it  I thought this book was amazing  A book that everyone should read  At the beginning I wasn t all that interested but after getting to know the characters a little more  I was obsessed  You feel like you know the characters  each and every one of them are incredibly interesting with their own story  There are so many twist and turns in this book and the ending  was a surprising one  If your looking to get a book that you know you will enjoy  get this one  It could get a little depressing for some people but I thought it all wrapped up quite nicely  The book had pretty much everything I wanted out of it  It was a thriller  with romance  lust  talking about real problems  from lots of different perspectives   Desde el principio supe que me iba a gustar  En el momento en que Rachel empezo haciendo su narracion pude sentir esa tristeza y desesperacion  y si  es una borracha que no hace mucho por salir de su hueco  pero a mi me agrado  La vida tampoco la ha ayudado mucho que digamos Pero dejando de lado el personaje principal  me encontre una trama que te mantiene pegado a las paginas  Tiene una narrativa poco complicada y las situaciones en las que se ven envueltos los personajes son atrapantes Si bien es cierto  el gran misterio es predecible desde mas o menos la mitad del libro   o al menos hasta esa parte lo descubri yo  queria seguir leyendo  ver como terminaba esa historia Ahora  claro que es un poco  muy  extrana e irreal la manera en que Rachel se ve involucrada con  Jess y Jason  y eso es algo que no me termina de cuadrar bien con el libro  Pero aparte de esto  las emociones que me transmitian los personajes  los giros de la historia y el final  se merecen un cinco  Se que todo el mundo dice que no es un buen libro que es una mala copia de Gone Girl pero  a quien le importa Me encanto  no puedo puntuar con menos de 5 estrellas  Es adictivo  intenso y con personajes muy bien logrados Coincido en que el desenlace es un poco predecible pero fue un verdadero placer leer un final de 100 paginas Excelente comienzo de lecturas para este 2016  In the genre of Gone Girl with a terrifically tense ending but I liked Gone Girl better  The latter had more twists and turns and didn t have me gritting my teeth at the girl  Rachel  on the train  hence the book title  who just couldn t help herself getting in deeper and deeper   I know I shouldn t do this but         became an annoying refrain  This book is really interesting if you like stories with a little more sexual feelings and crime novels  When I first read this book  I wasn t sure I liked it  but as it progressed a little more  I was enjoying it with the fact that it was different point of views  It had different characters which had their own problems  but what I liked about it  is that all of them interacted some way  One of the characters would be connected to another and another in a way I did not see coming  I really recommend this      Yes  this is another ringing endorsement for The Girl On the Train and yes  I can see the similarities to Gone Girl  but I think this book wins out   While I read Gone Girl in a shorter period of time the reason it took me longer to read The Girl On the Train was because I kept picking it up  reading a few pages  then I would close the book because I was afraid I would get to the end too quickly and it would all be over  I love that about this book  The only reason I made myself finish it at all  because I never wanted it to end  was that I read on the internet that it was being made into a movie and I can t wait for that experience  so basically I had something to look forward to when the book ended   I should include a few more specifics as to what I enjoyed so much about the book  so here goes  It was incredibly fast paced and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time  While like some other reviewers I did guess the outcome  it wasn t until much later in the book for me because of all the red herrings  secrets and character back stories the author continued to throw in  The book was very relatable to me at this time as I myself have just started taking public transportation  although  the bus and not the train like the main character Rachel does and I often find myself making up stories in my head of people I see on the street as I pass by  Rachel is an alcoholic who rides the train daily on her way back and forth to a job she no longer has due to her drinking  On this train ride she passes the houses of Megan and Anna  the other central characters  The story is told alternately through their eyes  Again  while there are some similarities to Gone Girl  I feel this book stands on its own as an engaging psychological thriller  so go pick it up  A riveting mystery set in current day London  I was mesmerized   I devoured this book in 24 hours  it was gripping  It made me nervous and jumpy because I wanted to know what happened  The chapters rotate between three characters  each with their own flaws and self destructive behavior  At times I was frustrated with the main character Rachel  wanting to shake her out of her alcoholic  self destructive spiral  It is British book  that comes with a writing style that I often find in British literature  not bad  but different from Americain literature  I find that a lot if English movies and books can be a bit depressingly  now this is a gross over generalization  I know  It s not that I don t enjoy them  I just have to be in the right mindset I did love this book  like Gone Girl  it had a darker path  a thriller through and through  I loved this book  I couldn t put it down  I highly recommend reading it   Okay   I let my kids go hungry so I could finish this book  Craziness    The Girl on the Train was the first book I read for the Beat the Heat Readathon and I picked it up because so many people have said how fabulous it is  I now agree  What a roller coaster ride  The story was completely engrossing right from the beginning and I couldn t put it down  The main character  Rachel  was painted perfectly as a woman who was at her lowest and just couldn t seem to move on and let go of her past  She was truly pathetic at this time in her life  making such terrible decisions that I would cringe  and yet at the same time  I found myself secretly hoping that she would break free from her torment and begin the journey back to normalcy As you move further into the story  the plot thickens and the dramatic intensity increases significantly  Once I got to the final third of the book  I knew I wouldn t be stopping until I finished and there was no guessing what the end would have in store until you were almost on top of it  The possibilities as I read seemed endless and once the mystery was introduced  I found myself jotting down all of my theories and then crossing them out as I came upon something to lead me in another direction or change my thinking  When I finally had my  Aha   moment  I was pretty close to the end  It was very well written and I m looking forward to reading other books by this author  I will definitely be adding The Girl on the Train to my top ten for 2015  Great readFinally a mystery I didn t figure out until the author wanted me to  Loved this  Would love to see Rachel find true happiness  4 5 Sterne Like a freight train hurtling towards the open track  so I plowed my way through this brilliant  heart pounding gem of a thriller  I can t say enough good things about this book   the characterization  Perfection  I can t remember the last time I read such a good portrayal of the unreliable narrator   oh yes I can  it s Gone Girl  I loved Rachel and all her miserable addictions   the alcohol  the train  her ex  This was a book about damaged women  and it didn t flinch the way so many do when it comes to portraying women as anything less than a shining  perfect ideal  I ve read a lot of great books this year  and this takes it s rank at the top of the list  I could barely put this book down  I found it to be better written than Gone Girl  and quite a bit more enjoyable to read  Rachel has hit rough times she is an alcoholic  is unemployed and divorced  She feels apathetic about her life  until one day when she witnesses something from the train      Beautiful sunshine  cloudless skies  no one to play with  nothing to do  Living like this  the way I m living at the moment  is harder in the summer when there is so much daylight  so little cover of darkness  when everyone is out and about  being flagrantly  aggressively happy  It s exhausting  and it makes you feel bad if you re not joining in   OMG I loved  loved  loved  loved  loved this book   I have been vigorously enthusing about this book since I finished it  I love mystery suspense thrillers  But usually I have most of the mystery figured out before I even hit halfway in  Not here  I was suspicious of everyone at some point  You just can t trust anyone here  and it s glorious It s beautifully written  and that is rare for me to say for books written in first person  I usually find them harder to relate to  but not here  The book takes place inside of the brains of three different women  and I genuinely felt as though I was inside of each of them  They are all relatable in their own ways  all real  all dangerous and suspicious  all in danger and frail  Wow  What a ride Oh  I know  I said that already  But it bears saying again  Honestly  Hollowness  that I understand  I m starting to believe that there isn t anything you can do to fix it  That s what I ve taken from the therapy sessions  the holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mold yourself through the gaps Rachel rides the train every day  It stops at a signal in her own neighborhood  She can see the house where she lived with her ex husband   where he now lives with his new wife and daughter  And a few doors down  she can see the house of a happy young couple that often have coffee on a back veranda  She makes up stories in her head about the couple  fantasizing their happy life since her own is gone   There s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home    And they are a partnership  I can see it  I know how they are  His strength  that protectiveness he radiates  it doesn t mean she s weak  She s strong in other ways  she makes intellectual leaps that leave him open mouthed in admiration  She can cut to the nub of a problem  dissect and analyse it in the time it takes other people to say good morning  At parties  he often holds her hand  even though they ve been together years  They respect each other  they don t put each other down   One day  the female half of the couple is gone  And the next  Rachel discovers she s been reported missing  Was what she s seen from the train something that could help solve the disappearance Anna is married to Tom  who used to be married to Rachel  She was the other woman  before she lived in this house  and kind of liked it better that way  Being the other woman is a huge turn on  there s no point denying it  you re the one he can t help but betray his wife for  even though he loves her  That s just how irresistible you are   She watches the trains go by  hating them  She hates Rachel too  who seems to be constantly in their lives  let s be honest  women are still only really valued for two things  their looks and their role as mothers  Megan is a wife to Scott  and they sit on their veranda to sip coffee and watch the trains  But Megan is feeling stifled in her suburban life  and their happiness is not exactly what it seems  But I have to do something  and at least this feels like action  All those plans I had  photography courses and cookery classes  when it comes down to it  they feel a bit pointless  as if I m playing at real life instead of actually living it  I need to find something that I must do  something undeniable  I can t do this  I can t just be a wife  I don t understand how anyone does it  there is literally nothing to do but wait  Wait for a man to come home and love you  Either that or look around for something to distract you   I love these women  I love their stories  I cheered for them and cried for them and felt deeply in my heart for them  I saw parts of myself reflected in each of them  Some in sad and scary ways  When did you become so weak   I don t know  I don t know where that strength went  I don t remember losing it  I think that over time it got chipped away  bit by bit  by life  by the living of it  I also thought the writing here was just beautiful  That s not something I often find in mysteries thrillers   passages so lovely that I go back to re read them just for the sheer pleasure of it   It feels like coming home   not just to any home  but a childhood home  a place left behind a lifetime ago  it s the familiarity of walking up stairs and knowing exactly which one is going to creak   It s simple but poetic and speaks right to the heart of me  I highly recommend this book  It s absolutely wonderful  Well written and bitterly sad  Thrillers aren t my usual fare  so they have to be pretty gripping to reel me in  The last time I recall tearing through a thriller as quickly as this one was when I read  Derailed  by James Siegel  Coincidentally both involve trains  As soon as I read the premise for  The Girl On The Train  I had to read it  I myself am a people watcher  though maybe not quite so invested in the lives of specific strangers as Rachel is in the lives of  Jess  and  Jason  There was nothing I didn t enjoy about this book  None of the characters were particularly likeable  but all were compelling enough to read about  which is not an easy thing to achieve  Although  I didn t dislike Rachel  I found myself relating uncomfortably to her endless good intentions for a fresh start tomorrow  knowing tomorrow is always a day away  I can see why people might pity or despise her  much in the way they do in the novel  but honestly I just felt empathetic  I wanted something to go right for her  and completely understood her compulsion to unravel the mystery she finds herself tangled up in The narrative jumps around  temporally and from one viewpoint to another  and often such books lose me so entirely that I give up any semblance of understanding what s occuring  This book  however  covered quite a short span of time in two separate years  and each viewpoint was distinct enough to create distinct jigsaw pieces which slotted together perfectly  I had five ideas about whodunnit  all of which were wrong  and on three separate occasions I thought  this reads like an ending  what more can happen    An easy read  a complex but not over complicated  and certainly not unbelieveable  plot  and while it probably doesn t  quite  deserve five stars  not entirely sure about that scene at the end   it definitely left me satisfied enough to award them  The Girl on the Train opens with Rachel  the title character  riding the commuter train and ruminating on the current state of her life  It isn t long before the reader becomes aware that Rachel is divorced  unemployed  and an alcoholic  and that her marriage and job both ended as a result of her drinking  Rachel pretends to go to work  so her flatmate won t find out that she s lost her job Rachel mourns the end of her relationship with ex Tom and is unable to move on  even though Tom  who is already remarried with a young daughter  clearly resents her intrusions on his new life  To help herself cope with her feelings  Rachel makes a study of a young couple as the train passes their terrace   Jason  and  Jess  are a perfect couple  blissfully in love  A few houses down  Tom lives with his new wife  Anna  and their infant daughter  in the house Rachel once shared with Tom Rachel s life is messy and unhappy  She drinks to the point of blacking out and continues to make horrible  damaging decisions during these blackouts  While she acknowledges to herself that her drinking is ruining her life  she cannot stop  Then Rachel realizes that something horrifying happened while she was drunk  she wakes up at home cut and bleeding from her head  and Tom is upset with her  Rachel can t remember anything  Something else happened the same night  something involving a beautiful young woman named Megan But Rachel knows her as Jess The Girl on the Train is a riveting and suspenseful look at the inner workings of marriage and the ugly secrets that can lie beneath the facade of marital bliss  Rachel is depicted as a pathetic  drunken  aging woman who cannot let go of her ex and has no control over her own life  She s not particularly likable and there s nothing to admire about her  Although she is an unreliable narrator  Rachel s raw  unflinching honesty with herself and her earnest desire to help  Jason   who is really Scott  made me care about her  I felt I could understand her anguish and heartbreak The story telling and pacing were well done and the characters were mostly well developed  They are complex people who seem real  The one exception is Anna who I felt was poorly developed  Everyone is saying that this book is the next  Gone Girl    after reading the book I understand the comparison  It is a completely different story but the way it kept me turning the pages well into the early morning hours definitely made the long tiring day at work the next day worth it  Even after I finished the book I couldn t stop thinking about how it all turned out  Only a great book has that effect on me  Would definitely recommend  5 stars on goodreads   will be getting another 5 stars at my book club meeting next month Well done Paula Hawkins  great story   can not wait to read more from this author  Aku suka banget sama gaya bercerita Paula  Dia pinter banget bikin aku betah membuka halaman demi halaman dan terbius dengan ceritanya  Dan melebihi semua itu  aku sukaaaaa banget sama endingnya  Gak cuma jago di narasi dan deskripsi  Paula juga jago bikin aku terkecoh beberapa kali  Malah  mendekati akhir cerita  meski dugaanku kuat kalo dialah pelakunya  aku rela membuka kembali bab bab Megan sebelumnya demi mencocokkan dan menguatkan dugaanku  Berasa jadi detektif beneran nih hehehe Mmm  kalo soal ketegangan  menurutku terbilang lambat datangnya  Kenapa  Karena di awal awal aku merasa genre dramanya begitu kuat  Itu sih pendapatku  Yah  sama kayak The Cuckoo s Calling gitu  tapi rasanya novel ini jauh lebih baik  Dari segi pengolahan jalan cerita  misteri  dan pengungkapannya  Lebih bikin penasaran dan masuk akal  Pokoknya  narasi dan deskripsi Paula adalah segalanya yang bikin aku betah baca buku ini  Eng  ada dua benda dalam bab awal novel ini yang rasanya gak berguna  cuman jadi hiasan dan gak pernah disebut sebut lagi dalam pengungkapan fakta  Sekiranya begitu  Atau apa aku memang lupa ya     This book was awesome   It took a couple chapters but   OMG    A journey into crazy      At first I was impatient with the three main protagonists  until the reasons for their behavior started to be revealed  and then I was completely hooked  I was obsessed with the story until I could reach the end  and now I m missing the world of those characters  Just the kind of book I love  Read this in 48 hours  I couldn t put it down  And I ll be sleeping with the lights on tonight   image   image error This book reminds me of why i started read and why I fell in love with literature  As muh as you try to put this novel down you cant until you know  who done it   The book revolves around three whose lives are interwined and a mysterious black out that holds the key to everything  Just when I thought I might know who the killer was my mind drives me into a different direction  A great book  for those who love a good mystery and thriller  To be really honest  I hesitated when I selected this book to read  I was not exactly sure of what to expect  Anyway  from the beginning to probably before Rachel found out who killed Meghan  it was really difficult for me to like Rachel  She knows she is a drunk and keeps trying to be better  to stop drinking and she is always so weak  So many times I resisted the urge to yell  Oh  come on    I love the story and the ending  I also agree that it is somewhat darker than  Gone Girl   Worth reading  soooooo good      Another book I found on the top seller lists that I thought I d like to read  It was hard to put down  It sucks you in right away  It s narrated by the three different women in the story  from their point of view Rachel  who was married to Tom  She s now bitter  angry   an alcoholic  riding the commuter train and inventing stories of the people she sees at the train stops  in her old neighborhood  Anna  who is now married to Tom has a child Rachel was unable have with him  The neighbor lady Megan  who is married to Scott  who has turned up missing   Okay  interesting back story on how I came upon The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  I really didn t pay any intention to this book before I started noticing insane numbers on the hold list for this book  A good example is The Philadelphia Free Library which has  as I write this review  1172 patrons on the hold list for it It was then I remembered getting a copy of it when it first came out and  like The Other Typist and A Pleasure and a Calling  wasn t sure I d ever get around to reading it  but when I started seeing these numbers and then reading the reviews and noticed that it was on top of the NYT best seller list and the fasting selling adult book in history  I jumped on it Let me start by saying that we finally have a worthy successor to Patricia Highsmith  If your a fan of Highsmith s and have been waiting for another writer with her style  you ll have to wait no longer  The story itself is pure Highsmith even down to the story begining on a train and with characters worthy of Tom Ripley and Chester MacFarland  It turns the unreliable narration on its head It s been 20 years since Highsmith s death and  if you ve been waiting that long for this novel  it needs to your next read  Even if you ve never read her and you liked Gone Girl  you ll love The Girl on the Train  Yes I binge read this book today    The boys and I were all sick so we stayed home today so I decided to pick up a book to read    And I ended up reading the whole book in a few hours    It is a psychological thriller  A girl in a suburb neighborhood goes missing and her body turns up not long after    And since I m usually good at guessing who the killers are in books and TV shows  haha   I guessed the killer right away and I turned out to be right    But I must admit I doubted my guess several times throughout the book  So I wasn t really disappointed with how things turned out  But the real big twist is on the very last page of the book  I did not see that coming which is why I bumped the rating from four to five stars  I got goosebumps when I finished the book  One thing to note is that none of the characters in this book are perfect  They have many weaknesses and are not very likable at times  At times I felt the victim kind of deserved what she got  But I was still fascinated by how crazy and flawed they all were  too   Except maybe Rachel s flatmate  Cathy  And honestly made me feel better about myself haha I bought this book the week it came out  and I d never heard of the author before  This is her first thriller book  and so I wasn t expecting it to be brilliant  I think  however  that I was wrong  The Girl On The Train  is a fast paced thriller following the alcoholic Rachel  and some other characters  and her journeys on the train each morning  One day  she witnesses something that means that everything has changed  and she becomes involved in a dramatic situation where the reader is constantly guessing what is going to happen next  Generally  when I am reading a thriller  I don t find it too hard to work out what is going to happen  or at least where it is going  When reading this though  I found myself unable to guess properly because there were so many clever twists in it  Paula Hawkins appears to be very good at masking certain elements within the story  which makes the path it takes even more interesting I found the writing style very easy to read  as it was written nicely and in quite a modern style  but it was very hard to read at the same time   there a lot of emotions within the book  and certain scenes can be quite traumatic  I found myself welling up on public transport quite frequently from the raw sadness of the characters  or gripping the book tight due to the element of suspense  Once I was in the story it was impossible to get away from it   even after putting it away I would still find myself thinking about it afterwards  I found the characters incredibly interesting  and their lives were intricate and complex  making them intriguing to read about  I was also very satisfied with the ending  which again is rare for me  What I enjoyed most about the book was its pace   it was very fast paced  in that it was an involved thriller where a lot of things happened and a lot of concepts had to be realised very quickly  There was a lot of rushing about and at parts I found myself racing through the book  eager to see what would happen  Despite this  it was also very slow paced  and Paula Hawkins had got the balance of the two just right  The book involves a lot of introspection  something I really like in a story  and allows you a lot of access into the characters  minds  even if they don t necessarily reveal everything straight away  We see the thoughts and perspectives of several different characters  which makes it quite hard to keep up with  but it also means that we are putting the jigsaw together ourselves   constantly scrambling for information and trying to put together different scenes and judgements I would one hundred percent recommend this book to anyone looking for a good thriller  I m impressed that the author has done so well considering she has not written a thriller before  and I think everyone needs to read it just to experience the emotions that she has so well put across in it  My advice   go buy this book  I loved this book    Just SO SO good   Wow  fast paced  twisting plot  great read  Similar style to Gone Girl  Read this book   Went by SO FAST and while slightly predictable at the end I really enjoyed racing through this  One of those books you want to stay up later for and read more  Couldn t put this book down    I loved this book  Couldn t put it down  The different viewpoints and timelines used to tell the story provided the perfect amount of suspense and mystery  Just as twisty and almost as dark as Gone Girl  In the genre of Gone Girl  you will not be able to put the book down through all the twists and turns  Told in the alternating voices of Rachel  the alcoholic ex wife  Anna  the current wife  and Megan  the murder victim  the suspense of all that happens starts with Rachel and the stories she attributes to people she watches from the morning train  Not my usual read  but excellently done  I started this book on the evening of 29 Dec and finished it the next day   a first for me in years  The story telling was so vivid and compelling  I simply could not stop flipping pages one chapter after another    To be sure  this is not an uplifting saga  which appears to have caused some reviewers personal uneasiness and displeasure  It is a deep psychological dive into the seediness and wretchedness of certain human proclivities including  but not limited to  obsession  possession  aggrandizement  exploitation  and victimization  All of the main characters are flawed in one way or another although at least two  through introspection  courage  and bravery  find a modicum of salvation in the end  Paula Hawkins does a masterful job of unveiling the intertwined lives of a half dozen morally impaired men and women through various adulterous  debaucherous  deceitful  and destructive behaviors  The story is as sickening as it is gripping and   perhaps   that is one of Hawkins  implied messages  like Rachel  some of us are  indeed   rubberneckers  who want to be involved and cannot turn away from the sleazy and sordid aspects of humanity even though  paradoxically  we espouse them to be despicable  shameful  and deplorable   This book first gripped me when it was slowly revealed how bad of a drinking addiction Rachel had  Her life is in shambles to what it once was  and she blames herself and her drinking for most of it  She wishes she was still married to Tom  but knows it is all her fault  She leaves him drunken voicemails or calls his house late at night  but does not always remember what she says  I would smack my face on Rachel s behalf when she would wake up the next morning and realize what horrible decision she had made the night before when she was blacked out  I would cheer each time I thought she was staying sober for a few days  and then she would fall off the wagon again and make another bad choice  It was like watching a car accident where you can t look away  even though you know you should In this case  you should keep looking since there is more to the story than her being a sad drunk  This is what I loved about the story  I felt for Rachel  even though there was so much not to feel for her  She is a character that could be easily shunned and looked down upon  but I wanted there to be more to her  I felt there was at the end of the book  While I loved reading the other two characters  perspectives  I always wanted to go back to Rachel to move her story along  even when it seemed really pathetic  The overall mystery is a good one  even though it is sad in how it affected so many different people in the story  I don t know if it was a happy ending  but a satisfying one  I loved this book in so many ways  While the ending seemed a little  Lifetime movie ish  the characters had so much depth and soul  It gives tough topics like divorce  infertility  infidelity  and alcoholism a whole new perspective  If reading the book has left you feeling flat  listen to the audiobook  It s amazing   Um livro fantastico  arrepiante  absorvente Contado por tres personagens  que vao interligando as narrativas  que se nao estivermos bem atentos podrao levar em erro  porque neste livro nada e o que parece Parece que estamos vivendo num universo de loucos   em que nada pode ser possivel e de repente somos supreendidos e tudo de repente encaixa na perfeicao e e ai que este livro e fabuloso Adorei ler  um dos melhores livros do genero que li ate agora e consegui ler num so dia  pois e dificil largar a sua leitura sem chegar ao fim rapidamente  I grabbed THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN from Audible on its release day because the summary appealed to me  It s a debut from British former journalist and if the rest of her books are this good  she will be on my auto buy list forever  Excellent momentum of the plot alongside even better characterization  and damn these characters came alive  I didn t guess the ending so much as I was hoping against hope  view spoiler  because I hated Tom from his introduction and I knew he had to be a villain above and beyond his adultery   the ending would have only been better had Anna also been involved but she shows her true colors from the first page so there was not going to be any real reveal about her  hide spoiler   and I was rewarded  I suspected that Hawkings may  view spoiler  have made Rachel pregnant from the one night stand with Scott  hide spoiler   and I am beyond happy that she didn t go in that direction  A really  really wonderful read and it more than lives up the hype I ve since discovered about it  That was such an addictive read  And I read it on the train  No G T though  A few strong messages in the book   the consequences of abusive relationships  alcoholism and poisonous secrets  I suppose these are repeatedly used in this genre but I also liked the style of writing   had me flipping pages back to do my own investigation  Yes  it s been compared to Gone Girl but I think this is a far superior book  There is a similar mystery thriller aspect to it and the  unreliable  narrator angle  However  the literary skill of the author in describing the physical and emotional world of the protagonist as well as a deft hand at revealing the depth of the characters and their motivations makes this a far more satisfying and well written book on many levels   Rachel s life is complicated   she has hit near bottom since the breakup of her marriage  when the excuses began and the drinking got worse and she was fired  Her flawed personality can t quite let the guilt go so she spends each day traveling on the commuter train she used to travel each day before her life went off the rails  As she does she makes up a life about the couple she sees from the train stop until one day when she sees something she shouldn t  Her life spirals into desperation and confusion about the couple and the very real bad thing she thinks she saw  The couple have ties to her old life so as the book unfolds we will begin to piece together what happened and Rachel s part in it  Paula Hawkins gives us the perfect game of cat and mouse as told by the women in the story  You won t know who to trust  you won t know what is happening and you won t see it coming until it hits you in the face  There are so few books that you want to drop everything you are doing to finish and this is one of them  My thanks to the publisher for the advance copy of what is sure to be a runaway best seller   Tu nu o cunosti  dar ea te cunoaste   Rachel Watson face zilnic naveta spre Londra dintr o mica localitate

Banuiesc ca trebuie sa fie defect  pentru ca aproape intotdeauna lumina aceea e rosie  ne oprim in punctul asta in majoritatea zilelor  uneori pentru cateva secunde  alteori minute in sir  Daca stau in vagonul D  cum fac de obicei  si trenul opreste exact in dreptul acestui semnal  ca aproape de fiecare data  am un punct de observatie perfect pentru casa mea favorita de pe traseu  cea de la numarul cincisprezece   Cum suntem blocati la semnalul rosu  ii caut cu privirea  Jess e de obicei afara dimineata  mai ales vara  bandu si cafeaua  Cateodata  cand o vad acolo  am sentimentul ca si ea ma vede  ca se uita direct la mine si mi vine sa i fac cu mana  Dar sunt mult prea timida  Pe Jason nu l vad foarte des  e plecat la munca de cele mai multe ori  Dar chiar daca nu sunt acolo  ma gandesc la ei  la ce fac  la ce pun la cale  Poate ca azi e ziua lor libera si ea e in pat  in timp ce el pregateste micul dejun  sau poate ca au plecat amandoi sa alerge  pentru ca sunt lucruri care le fac ei de obicei        Poate ca Jess e acum in camera de oaspeti si picteaza sau poate ca sunt amandoi la dus  ea cu palmele sprijinite de faianta  el cu mainile pe soldurile ei   Pe unul din pereti  cineva a scris  VIATA NU E UN PARAGRAF   Nu stiu nici cum ii cheama  asa ca a trebuit sa i botez eu  Jason  pentru ca e un barbat bine  in stilul starurilor de film britanic  nu in stilul unui Depp sau Pitt  ci a lui Firth sau Jason Isaacs  Iar numele de Jess se potriveste cu Jason si cu femeia in sine  I se potriveste manusa  asa frumoasa si lipsita de griji cum pare  Sunt o pereche  un set  Sunt fericiti  pot spune  Sunt asa cum eram si eu  sunt ca mine si Tom  cum eram noi acum cinci ani  Ei sunt tot ce eu am pierdut  sunt tot ceea ce eu imi doresc sa fiu   Ma urmeaza  iar eu imi scot hainele de pe mine in timp ce urc scarile si cand ajungem in dormitor  cand ma impinge pe pat  nici macar nu ma gandesc la el  dar nu conteaza pentru ca el nu stie asta  Sunt suficient de buna incat sa l fac sa creada ca numai pe el il am in minte   In tren  lacrimile incep sa mi curga pe obraz si nu mi pasa ca oamenii se uita la mine  ar putea sa creada orice   ca a dat o masina peste cainile meu sau ca tocmai am fost diagnosticata cu o boala incurabila  Sau ca sunt o alcoolica stearpa  divortata si in curand aruncata pe drumuri   Eram in biblioteca  pe Theobalds Road  Tocmai ii

fericirea in alta parte  A great  old fashioned thrillerThe real shame is that Alfred Hitchcock is dead and therefore unable to film this book  It echoes some of his classics   you will find touches of  Rear Window    Spellbound   and  Suspicion   mixed with a heavy dollop of a famous non Hitchcock work   Gaslight  Other reviewers have given summaries  so I won t attempt to do it here  I would be too afraid to leave potential spoilers  All I can say to those idly picking it up is to stay with it  for quite a few pages I just wasn t  as they say   feeling it   Suddenly it snapped on me like a mousetrap and I couldn t escape its grasp   Well written  I really enjoyed this novel  While I thought it was predictable  I couldn t put it down  Please keep writing ms  Hawkins and I will definitely keep reading  4 8   It took me 3 days to finish this book and I couldnt didnt want to put it down Holy      What an amazing book  I definitely didn t piece the puzzle until more than halfway in  Was  initially  at first bored with Anna but thankfully she was redeemed as a character  Notable characters  Megan   Kamal  oddest  Scott   Anna  Rache was entertaining although unreliable at times but her interest driven by boredom or psychological reasons to be determined  This was a very psychologically entertaining novelOf course no one in this novel is remotely likable except for maybe Cathy  however I liked the melange of neuroses because it kept me guessing  Although I haven t read Gone Girl yet   next on my list  I like that The Girl On the Train goes deep into the psyche of human nature  Folks  life isn t pretty but in this fictional tale of betrayal  murder  psychology    addiction   its sure to linger and make you analyze and I m 100  okay with that POSSIBLE SPOILERS    two things i felt somewhat conflicted about  the ending   well the aftermath I wanted it a little longer and maybe differentScott s motives  was he just a narcissistic  Why did he just remove himself  We get one s fate but his remains a mystery on a psychological level  Gone Girl was amazing  but it s beginning to become like The Fault in Our Stars and The Hunger Games  STOP COMPARING BOOKS TO THEM  PLEASE  Love books separately  I get like  if you were a fan of this  you might be a fan of this  But yes    I dunno Anyway  loved it  It was quick  and I absolutely loved Paula Hawkins  writing 2015 READING CHALLENGE  A book with a love triangle Amazing     until the very end I did not expect that the person  who committed the hijacking  as the perpetrator    Love  love love this book   It s one of the best books I have EVER read    was on the edge of my seat   or bed reading it    Just couldn t work out who was the one that was the craziest   it is superbly written and if you didn t like crime and mystery before   I promise you will after reading this book Very rich characters  Rachel  Anna and Megan    You are sort of wanting Rachel to get it together and pull herself out of her slump but as you read it you begin to really feel for her  I can t give the story away but I promise you   you won t be bored   10 out of 10 for this This book is a page turner and a carefully crafted thriller that is almost like a screen play so I m not surprised to find it will be made into a film  But the real reason it deserves 5  is because the author has captured our times in a profoundly psychological way  Underpinning the story and the characters is the current obsession with individuals  with selfies  with perfection  As the lives of these flawed characters unfold we know we are in a contemporary setting  we recognise these people as real  misogyny is a sticky glue that you can t shake off and is so normalised that the female characters caught in its grip never see or name it  It is reflected in the sense of entitlement of the male characters  the sinister  hidden violence just under the surface  the need to control and fear of being controlled  This is also present in the love hate relationship characters have with Alcohol  The voyeurism that is sustained by reality TV is symbolised as Rachel stares from the train window each day and observes the lives of Megan and Scott and thinks she knows them   the Jason and Jess of her imagination who have the life she had  lost and longs for  Although internet dating does not figure in this book I heard recently that a third of couples In the 20 35 age group met online  And when they meet they tell each other lies  Lies figures almost as another character in this book  All the characters lie  They lie to each other and to themselves  As the writing carries us along we can t work out the truth from the lies either as we see the world through the first person narratives of the three main women protagonists  It is the women who are given voice and we see the male characters through their eyes  but they don t really see them  they are too caught up in the desire to have the relationship they fantasise about  Each is obsessed with self  how they feel  what their lives are like  have been  could be and it is all chimera  None of them are sympathetic characters yet we care  at least about the main character Rachel  but like Claire  who reluctantly gives Rachel a room in her house  we care because we think we should not because they are nice or good  The insidiousness of the controlling behaviour of the characters  in particular the main male character  Tom resonates with current understanding of abuse being mental and emotional as well as physical  I think the page turning nature of the book is also deceptive  it makes it seem lightweight  but it is hauntingly deep  My only disappointment is the crafting of the ending  this writer could definitely have done this better  I look forward to her maturing as a writer in her next book   It was similar to Gone Girl but I think it was better  I went back and forth between feeling sorry for Rachel and being annoyed with her for wrecking chances given to her  I was not surprised at the ending but I was fully engaged through out  It was a good book  You know the kind of book that you stay up all night reading  dropping everything to spend the day finishing it  sneaking in a chapter in the grocery line and between appointments because you have to know WHO DONE IT   That s this book  I can t stop thinking about this book The Girl on The Train   Paula Hawkins  Published by Doubleday 2015 Good stuff  pacy first person narrative told from three perspectives  Much hyped and acclaimed  it does deliver a great story in character  Three characters actually  Rachel  Anna and Megan  The story unfolds beautifully in a tightly written  real time way  Modern fiction is so very good at this  taking us places and dumping us into a hyper real world  almost filmic in its touchability and verisimilitude  Reality bites here  and to the constant rattle  screech and rock of the ever present trains  we enter frozen  broken lives  This is a thriller yes  this is popular yes  but don t get sneery  this is superbly well written and envisaged Just like Gone Girl we have unreliable narrators  people who tell it with guile or amnesia or both  Rachel is frozen hearted  having been dumped by her husband for a better model two years before she has fallen in alcoholism and despair  The interleaving of narratives works well  each with its own intrigue and enough question marks to keep us guessing to the end  I consumed this on Audiobook in a week and I would heartily recommend it  character voices strong  the sense of desolation and brokenness of two the female characters particularly well drawn  Women are the stars of this book and the men  virtually to a man  are the bastards  But who it  Who killed her  Who attacked Rachel  What really did happen in that underpass Great stuff  Well done Paula  brilliant job       Five Stars Read the last one hundred pages straight through   couldn t put it down  A nail biting story  Loved it  couldn t put it down although I liked the way it moved from character to character it was a little hard for to keep up with at times  didn t spoil it for tho   This is one of those books that you can t wait to get home and cuddle up with for a night of reading way past your bedtime  Rachel  the protagonist  is a sad  lonely drunk that has lost her husband  job and friends due to her drinking  As pretense  she continues to commute to London on the same train she use to ride to work  Sadly that train passes her old life that she can see from her regular seat  She also watched a husband and wife she grew fond of from afar  When the wife goes missing and Rachel knows she was the the area the woman disappeared from but she was drunk and can t remember what she saw or possibly did that evening  The story has twist and turns  I figured out the ending about 80  in but did not see that as a flaw  The story flowed and lead logically to its end  This book is compared to  Gone Girl  which makes sense give the style of writing  I think this story  characters and plot are far better  I liked the characters and cared about them  I hated Nick and Amy from  Gone Girl  and never cared about the ending  Rachel is sad but likable  you want her to win  Overall a great book that is highly recommended  Great book   unpredictable  I loved it  The fifth star is probably because I haven t read a thriller for so long  but this was great  Spooky  Just finished it at one am and am petrified to try and sleep  Wow  this was awesome  It was definitely a mystery worth solving page by page through the eyes of Rachel  Anna and Megan   Great  fast read  Loved it  This kept me guessing until the end  Well written  effortless prose that flowed from one page to the next  Fantastic 1st thriller read of 2015  couldn t put it down  Well worth a read even if this genre isn t your usual bag  The characters are so believable  If you commute by train your journey may never be the same again   Devoured this book in one sitting  Just couldn t put it down   had to know what happened  Unexpected conclusion I really loved this  It took me a bit to get into it and figure out what was going on and who was talking  but once I figured it out  I was really swept in  And I loved reading about a character who was an alcoholic  because it seemed to present that really truthfully  I wish Paula Hawkins had more books   A great readI don t read mysteries very often  Maybe I should rethink that  This story kept me guessing and just about made me late for work   I thought this was a great read  I could not put it down  I loved the little twists and turns and the fact that you get all three main women characters point of view  Well written and I would definitely recommend it It does make me wonder if I should now stop looking out the train window  going to and from work  Who knows what I might see   o  An excellent read  It read like a train ride  It started out slowly but built up such speed halfway through that you could not stop  It kept you guessing until the end  And the last paragraphs      holy shirts and pants I nearly screamed out loud   I was a little but nervous about this one because I saw it compared to Gone Girl repeatedly  which I did not enjoy because I felt like I couldn t connect to any of the characters  This book is similar in that it deals with some pretty crazy things and leaves you completely surprised by the end  but I found the characters much more sympathetic and relatable  especially Rachel  This is definitely a fast paced thriller and an entirely enjoyable one  It took me right up until the very end to piece everything together  but it all came together in a logical  albeit crazy and exciting  manner  I would definitely recommend   I absolutely loved this book  It really kept me guessing  I also really enjoyed the alternating points of view  Each character had their own story and their own issues and it all just blew me away at the end  I was in a reading slump when I read this book  and I flew through it  It is soooooo good  Although the ending is a bit predictable  it s a simple elimination process really  because there isn t that many characters in this book   it doesn t stop me from reading it  My hands were cold and I was so excited when I turned the last page  However  somewhere in the middle of the book  I got so angry reading it  I felt sorry for Rachel but at the same time I felt like she deserves all the mistreatments  She is so weak and whiny and she just keeps going  At some point I felt like I want to grab her out of the book and shake some sense into her  tell her to tidy herself up and stop obsessing over a man who is no longer in love with her  Oh well  of course Rachel has to be The Rachel  she is what makes this book so thrilling and addictive  Like another reviewer has stated  everyone is a hot mess in this book and that is so true  There isn t a single  good  character in this book  Everyone has dirty secretes or flaws  and that is what makes this book better than some others that I ve read  In reality  our mind can be pretty dark and fucked up  and that is what makes this book real   I grabbed this book quickly during a trip and wasn t sure what to expect  The author s ability to set the scene with every detail allow you to feel like you are standing right next to the characters as they interact  This gets you through the first half of the story as you are just trying to figure out what is going on and why the characters are such a mess  Then the books just rolls down the tracks and you don t want to get off at any of the stops until you are done  Great read if you like mysteries bundled with messy people with messy lives  Phew  This isn t great literature but it s a top notch  suspenseful can t put it down page turner  The plot is slightly reminiscent of Rear Window  an old Hitchcock movie  someone starts observing strangers from a distance and is then drawn into their lives  The engaging story and the author s pert style make for most enjoyable reading  Well I should have learned my lesson and not read this book before bed because I got about halfway through before I fell asleep  and ended up with chilling nightmares  But that only tells me that this book is great because it infiltrated my mind  my heart  and now my dreams  This book is dark  Like super dark  Every character in this book is dislikable  on purpose  There is no good guy  no angel  no protagonist  Just a whole bunch of messed up people running amuck and wrecking each other s lives  It s a book about lies  deceit  and false personas  It s a book about real life  The darkest parts of real life  but real none the less  That s probably one of the reasons I liked it so much  because there was no sugar coated  ideal character  Everyone was wrong  and in the wrong  and acted wrong  only some were at worse degrees than others  But you still walk away from this book unsure of which character you can defend  which one you can feel happy for  because you really can t  They are all terrible  terrible people who do terrible things and suffer terrible consequences for it  And yet  isn t that what life is Overall  a great read by Ms  Hawkins  and I can t wait to read more from her in the future  Fabulous job  Just fabulous   This was so good    So suspenseful and hard to predict  A great read with plenty of twists and turns  Highly recommended  I rate this as one of the better books I ve read  Compelling  Amazing balance between voices  Chilling and disturbing story  There isn t a single redeeming character in the book  except maybe Cathy  who is a total enabler   Read it   I will never look out windows of trains quite the way I used to Once I started reading this book  I could not put it down  It felt like Rear Window  Gone Girl and an Agatha Christie novel all at once  The story is told from the perspective of three women   Rachel  Anna and Megan   as their lives become entangled in some unusual ways  None are heroic  kind  strong or likable but as the story develops  you gain an appreciation for their struggles  and they each become somewhat sympathetic  Although not entirely Rachel is a divorced  unemployed  alcoholic in her early thirties who is obsessed with her former husband  Tom  Anna was Tom s mistress when he was married to Rachel  and now she is Tom s wife and the mother of his baby daughter  Megan and her husband live down the street from Anna and Tom  and Megan is also Anna and Tom s daughter s former nanny  This is just the tip of the iceberg to describe how their lives are intertwined  There is much much more Even though she was fired from her job a few months earlier  Rachel takes a commuter train every day while pretending to be employed so as not to incur the wrath  and eviction  of her landlady  The train ride gives her something to do and serves as the primary source of daily solace to Rachel along with copious amounts of alcohol  The route takes her past the home where she used to live with Tom  and where he continues to live with his petite new wife Anna  The train always stops directly behind the house where another young couple lives  and Rachel often sees them out on their terrace or in their yard  This couple is exquisite and she fantasizes about them as having the perfect marriage  the life she thought she had with Tom before everything went wrong  She has named them Jason and Jess  We later come to know them as Megan and Scott  and they live a few houses down from Tom and Anna  One day Rachel sees something startling from the train window and the story unfolds from there  The story is recounted over a period of about a year  with flashbacks here and there  and Rachel  Anna and Megan become known to us through their first hand accounts of their own lives and of one another s  The book takes us through infidelities  physical and emotional abuse  self discovery  alcoholic black outs  marital joy and marital despair  deception  sex  pregnancy and parenthood  and ultimately murder  We get to know Tom through the lens of all three narrators  and Megan s husband Scott is presented as a good man and as a bad man  depending on the point of view  The same is true of Megan s psychiatrist  who Rachel also begins to see as part of her sleuthing to uncover the truth of Megan s disappearance  There are two police officers who become involved in the mystery  and even these two act oddly at times  No one is what they seem  and everyone is a suspect  It is all rather fantastical but the suspense builds as the plot bubbles and thickens  and the more we learn about all of the characters  the more creeped out we become  I figured out a few of the plot twists before they were unveiled  which I think the author wants her readers to do  but it did not take away from the ending  The finale was as creepy as can be  but because of the skillful way the story is developed  it is entirely believable   Let s just say I finished this in three sittings and toward the end my roommate had to come into my room to make sure I was okay because I was yelling out of shock  Multiple times   Went from DNF to Five Stars  go figure I felt like the first 80 PERCENT  that s a lot   was slow  slow  slow And I was growing so weary of Rachel s alcoholism and just all of it    bleah The last 20 percent saved the day Glad I finished   I loved this book  I was sucked in from the very beginning  The writing was spot on and the story was interesting  The characters were well developed and the story flowed  I compared it to Gone Girl because that s what other people were doing  I read this book almost as fast as I read Gone Girl  but I didn t fling it against the wall and spend the next week seething over the ending  The ending was satisfying and fitting  So I thought it was 100  better than Gone Girl  I read it in 2 days  4 5 estrellasMe ha gustado mucho el libro  la forma que tiene de mantenerte enganchando a la historia  en hacerte muchas teorias que cambiaban y cambiaban  Al principio piensas unas cosas y conforme vas leyendo vas cambiando de opinion  hasta llegar al final  No voy a comentar mucho mas porque es un libro que es mejor leer sin saber mucho para sorprenderte hoja a hoja  Le doy 4 5 de 5 estrellas porque si es verdad que en determinadas ocasiones se me han hecho un poco largo  y en el final no  E encajaba las actitud de algunos personajes  En conclusion he disfrutado de esta lectura  Title  The Girl on the TrainAuthor  Paula HawkinsAge Group  AdultGenre  ThrillerSeries  N AStar Rating  5 out of 5 starsThis book was given to me by the publisher  Riverhead Hardcover  through Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review Do you like thrillers  Especially Gone Girl  If you ve answered yes to either of these questions  this book is for you  This book was incredibly creepy  claustrophobic  even  The pacing was spot on  I couldn t put it down  I devoured this book in a day and a half  Rachel  the ex wife  the drunk  the woman whose life fell apart  is trying so hard not to let her drinking get the best of her   And often  she loses to that vice  Then there s Anna  the ex mistress  the new wife to Rachel s ex  Tom  She doesn t really care about anyone about herself  Tom  and her daughter  Evie  And lastly  there s Megan  the discontent neighbor  restless and secretive   I love the way the story wove together  the way every little detail mattered  and I was breathless through most of this novel  The bottom line  A top notch debut from a promising author  I loved The Girl on the Train  easily one of my favorite books I ve read this year  Next on deck  The Orphan of Torundi by J L  McCreedy  HOLY  FREAKING  MOSES  AND because I am reading this for book club  that is the ONLY review I can do at this time   A compulsive read  I could not turn the pages fast enough  I want everyone I know to read it so we can all talk about it  If you liked Before I Go To Sleep by S J Watson   you will love this  Wow  It s not often a book has me losing hours  but this one did  It s fast paced  well written and believable  and I had a hard time putting it down  It s about perception and how a lot of the time we see things as we want them to be  or through a lens of prejudice and preconception  rather than how they actually are  It s not just about how Rachel learns the truth about the people she sees from the train  but also about how others see her Unlike some thrillers  the author lets the story unfold gradually  rather than telling us what happened right at the start and writing about how the others catch on  or how they solve the mystery  The mystery isn t revealed until several chapters into the book  The facts about what has appeared to have happened are revealed gradually  and pieces of the story fit together well  with no convenient but improbable coincidences and characters which do realistic things  It s possible that these events could be occurring anywhere at any time  Which is what makes it very creepy I really enjoyed this above average thriller and look forward to the author s next offering  It certainly made me look at my fellow train commuters in a different light   I loved The Girl On The Train  Seriously loved it  I loved it so much I had to take a reading break when I finished to let it soak into my psyche I came across this book by accident  I read it because it was compared to Gone Girl  which I liked but couldn t relate to the characters much  I thought it might be the same with The Girl On The Train  That wasn t the case  But I will share that there are pathological characters in this book This is a book that begs to be re read  It needs to be savored  but you want to read as fast as possible to get through the story The moral of the story  things are never as they seem  Psychological Page Turning MysteryThis was a book that I could not put down  I could not see ahead of where the story was going and never was very fond of the main character until late in the novel  I m not sure I cared a lot about any of the characters  This was the first time I read Paula Hawkins  I m unsure if I will actively pursue another of her books  although I believe her future books will be even better  The reading got a bit confusing at times on which character was talking  The chapters are divided by each speaking character  After a few chapters  I got the hang of it  The answers come bit by bit explaining the plot and they came at just the right time almost like bits of a tasty treat that make you think   Oh  so that s what was going on   It would have been nice to finalize each character but it had no effect on the story  What ever happened to the therapist or the red headed guy  A part that I enjoyed because I was caught up in the plot was when coming to spots in reading where I would talk to the character and make a suggestion  Much like watching a movie when you think   No  No  Do not open that door   I would definitely recommend this book to mystery fans  3 women  all seem pretty normal till one goes missing  I laughed  cried and was on the edge of my seat  I couldn t put the book down  Well written  I could not put this one down  Very good  I am usually pretty good a predicting a lot of these mysteries in books but this one nearly got me  It wasn t until near the end that I caught on to what happened  And it still managed to give me a minor surprise at the end This was a real page turner of a book  I tore through it  The characters  oy  There is probably not one character I can say I actually liked  though that didn t stop me from cheering one or two of them on  It REALLY made me despise others  though  and this often included the main character  or who I think the main character is  anyway    Hands down the best mystery I ve read in a long  long time   Be ready to put your life on hold when you start reading this book  I couldn t put it down  There are so many twists and turns in the plot and any hunches you have about  who done it  aren t going to be answered until the end of the book  I guarantee you will be surprised by the outcome  All the characters are flawed in their own ways and one some level each of them is unlikeable  As a counselor I thought a lot about how each of the characters became the person they are and what needs were being met through their situations  It was an engrossing read    It s because I feel like I m part of this mystery  I m connected  I am no longer just a girl on the train  going back and forth without point or purpose Rachel   Anna  Megan  This three women have a lot more in common  more than they knew it    Each of The girl s POV explains their character  It s a definite page turner  you just can t simply stop coz you really like to know what and how everything happens   The ending was excellent   more to follow       My favorite character was definitely Rachel though frankly  I didnt like her at first  she s this messed up and broken person that had so many issues in life  wallows in self pity and a drunkard      she thinks she s worthless because she can t have something she truly wants  she s not the kind of woman you want yourself to be with  but as the story progresses  i admired her strength  the will to help others  to be involve  to have a purpose   and that s why she dig into the mystery that only she can truly unravel because without her remembering it  she s the only witness   the holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mould yourself through the gaps  I never really got the hype surrounding Gone Girl  It was a perfectly satisfactory book  but that s really all it did for me  This  This was a deliciously plotted psychological thriller  I loved every minute of it  This  needs  to be a series  Paula Hawkins  are you listening  Forget the haters  you made the rest of us care about this character and now she should have her own series like a latter day Miss Marple  as nosy but also willing to sleep with suspects when the investigation requires it   I mean have you seen the travesty that television has made of the Marple series recently  relegating her to a sidey role while some floozie takes centre stage because older women are like poor people  we know they exist but they must not spoil our entertainment by invading our tv screens   Paula Hawkins  Write a sequel  Make this a series  pretty puhleeze  So happy to see that  1  character  instead of just nonstop action  is making a literary comeback  2  the madness of modern marriage is being exposed post Richard Yates  he did his bit for his era but since then we ve been languishing 3  novels can end without our flawed heroes having to apologize for their subversiveness by disappearing into the unicorn laden sunset all safely partnered up4  someone can say  yeah but let s not romanticize the sisterhood either5  we can t leave it to the professional detectives and police to solve our mysteries  amateur sleuths are irreplaceable  i e  we better save ourselves 6  books by mature women with mature characters can be a smashing success without a  hiding behind a male pen name or b  tucking your female hero behind your male one like a prop  J K  Rowling  dearie  take note of this one  Hallelujah   I ve been the fool  If he does it with you  he ll do it to you   This is the story of three women  Rachel  Anna  and Meghan  Rachel is the Girl on the Train  who likes to watch the people in the houses that the commuter train passes every day and imagine how they live and how perfect their lives are compared to her lonely existence  Then one day something happens to one of these perfect people and Rachel feels incredibly drawn to find out what really happened  None of the characters are  perfect people   They are all very real  Rachel has a problem with alcohol  Anna is a guilty  home wrecker  and Meghan has a secret from her past that is keeping her from ever being a whole person  This is tremendous thriller and it has a complete ending  So many books nowadays seem to end with a sequel in mind but not so for this  You can feel like you know the whole story  There are plenty of twists and turns in this story and it kept me guessing right until the very end  The people in this story  while not wholly likeable become people you root for unlike the unlovable characters in  Gone Girl   You know this will be a movie but I recommend you read the book first  it s truly wonderful  Paula Hawkins is new at fiction writing but her future is bright  The three ladies who do the narration  Clare Corbett  Louise Brealey and India Fisher all do a clever job with their characters  Don t miss this one   Gone Girl was terrible  The Girl on the Train is more well written  has crisper prose  and even more abhorrent characters  if you can even imagine that   I liked the ending  too  which was the worst part of Gone Girl  Please  everyone  let s all start talking about The Girl on the Train    This book is amazingly thrilling  It kept me on my toes the whole time   In this thriller we first take the viewpoint of Rachel  the girl on the train  Daily she passes the road on which she used to live and sees a couple a few doors away whose lives fascinate her  As the book progresses we see the viewpoint of the girl she watches and of the woman who usurped her as her husband s second wife  Rachel is an alcoholic and suffers blackouts  She s been made aware that she s done some disgraceful things when drunk  some of which resulted in her husband s affair and their subsequent divorce  We watch a drama unfolding and learn much more about the lives of all three women and about what actually happened in some of Rachel s blackout moments I found this a very compulsive read  The writing style with its rushed  run on sentences initially annoyed me but I suspect the fact that I was reading faster was partly down to that  It s a great thriller and full of unexpected revelations  Very enjoyable  Really gripping story  i honestly couldn t put it down  Anyone that liked Gone Girl or similar books will like this for sure  Loved  Could not put this down  Wow   I read this in a day  I could not put it down  What a page turner  This book keeps you on your toes from start to finish  Excellently written and great characters  Enthralling  The pace was good  Despite the characters being such hot messes  I was still so engrossed in it all   I loved the suspense  I was biting my nails for the last 15  wondering how it was all going to go down  There were times during the first half that I thought it was dragging on a bit and I found the voices of the three women somewhat similar  but any minor complaints I had were erased by the fast pace of the last 15   Kept my attention and had a hard time putting it down  Loved it  This was an excellent thriller with an interesting plot  fleshed out  unreliable  characters  and so many twists and turns you can t put it down  As usual  when I really enjoy a book  I don t have much to say except to recommend others run out and read it  What a wild ride  Wow   What a great story  What a great plot  And what great characters  Part way through  this was shouting and hollering  Gone Girl  at me and as much as I liked that book the characters were annoying and unbelievable  Which delightedly is a stark contrast to the characters in this novel  The narratives over the 3 girls was amazing and the writing skill to tie everything together was so impressive  There wasn t anything I didn t like  and couldn t put it down  so much so I completed it in less than 24hours  Top 3 books I ve read this year definitely   Fast read  entertaining  Definitely recommend it  When I was in elementary school  many years ago  I had a teacher who would would bring in a puzzle for the class to solve  It would be a large picture  covered with a sheet of cardboard that had been cut into jigsaw pieces  She would take a piece of the puzzle out  ask a question and the student with the correct answer got a chance to guess what the picture was behind the cardboard  Everyone would think they knew what the hidden picture was  but as each puzzle piece was removed  we saw something different  Sometimes she would turn the picture on its side  or upside down  making everything look totally different  More often than not  we wouldn t figure it out until the last part of the picture was revealed and we d be so surprised This is what The Girl on The Train reminded of  a continually shifting story that changed with each chapter  Told through the voices of three women  Rachel  Anna and Meghan  life as seen through the window of a moving train is not always what it seems  A cleverly written suspense mystery  it might remind the reader of Gone Girl  but this story stands completely on its own  the characters  especially the protagonist  aren t particularly likable  but five stars because it is a page turner i picked it up in the evening and only put it down a few hours later when I was done  Resena  http   goo gl e7i47CEs increible la forma en que este libro te mete en un laberinto y por momentos  te deja sin salida alguna  Es muy  pero muy dificil dejar de leerlo  No es un libro excelente  pero condensa de manera ingeniosa todos los elementos de un buen thriller y no deja que lo sueltes  Eso vale mucho  This is one of those hard to put down whodunnit type books  The unreliable narrator is a fantastic lens through which to experience the book  although hers is not the only perspective readers are treated to  Divorced  depressed  and usually drunk Rachel takes the train into London for work each day  She lives with a roommate she doesn t quite care for  works at a job she is at best indifferent to  and  daily  watches the houses on her former street through the train window  She can see the house where her ex husband and his new wife live and enjoys imagining the lives of another couple that live a few houses down  This watching turns to obsession when the young woman disappears  seemingly coincidentally on a night where a drunk and heartbroken Rachel has unwisely gone stumbling through her former neighborhood  As Rachel struggles to piece together the missing hours  readers realize just how unreliable Rachel s memories are  I would particularly recommend this for fans of Gone Girl or anyone who loves Hitchcock  This is a kind of post feminist Rear Window  Worth the read   Loved it and the audio book is awesome  Hawkins doesn t need another review and so all I ll say is that if you re looking for a page turner  if you re looking to understand the power of alcoholism and emotional abuse  if you like chapters which end with a twist that keep you up at night saying I ll just read one more chapter then read The Girl on The Train  It won t disappoint   At first I thought   Depressing   but I persevered and OMG  Must read  Very well done  Wow this book would make a great movie   The ending was intense    Meme Review All aboaaaaaaard  It s the    This is not your standard Fatal Attraction  Oh  the twists and turns and craziness  Enjoy this ride on the crazy train  Next stop   the asylum  MWA HA HA HA HA  Couldn t put this down  I would highly recommend the audiobook  the narrators were excellent  I absolutely loved it  think I would have found it to be a little slow had I read it instead of listened to it  If Paula Hawkins can do anything  it s make well rounded and relatable characters  as proven by this page turning thriller I found this an easy book to get through  despite having a slow build to a less than expected climax Hawkins masterfully built the plot to what I had hoped would be a crazy mind bending crescendo  but unfortunately didn t  It was still interesting  but a bit of a disappointment  to me at least All in all this was an intriguing novel that was great for curling up with on a cold winters day  but will probably not be changing any lives any time soon  Picked this book up at midnight BIG MISTAKE as it is UNPUTDOWNABLE book in the same league as  Gone Girl   Highly recommend read  Psychological Thriller Still thinking about it  Can t get this one out of my head   a flawed heroine trying to work things out through an alcoholic fog  Compelling  Kept me up until 2 am  Hitchcock would have loved to direct this    Rachel commutes to london everyday by the same train along the way she sees a couple who she starts referring to as jess and jason and to her they are the prefect couple they live on the same street as her ex husband and his new wife   On the way to London one morning rachel sees something that makes her realise that jess and jason are not as prefect as she thought they was and by witnessing this event it allows rachel to become part of their lives I brought this thursday on release day there was so much hype about this book on twitter that on that morning at 5 20 i woke up turned my kindle on and started reading and did the same on saturday morning this book gripped me and made me read it until i was on the last page The story is told by 3 female narratives rachel our lead  megan  the so called jess  and the new wife of rachels ex husband Anna The three character narratives were flawless but i can honestly say i have never read a book with so many messed up characters my first thoughts of rachel was that she was an alcholic stalker  every character has there own problems   they are all deceitful but this made the story for me as they was all suspicious and it had me turning the pages The more i read the more rachel grew on me in parts of the book i am willing for her not to have a drink and to sort herself out and by doing this she would  not spoling the story  remember the events I did not see the ending at all it surprised me as i had suscipions about every single character  The ending was very clean it tied everything up This review does not the book any justice so urge if your reading my review and not read it to buy the book With its flawless narration  a perfect story and just basically everything about this book i could easily see this book being my best read of the year and the book of 2015 This book is the epitome of thrillers  I had always been a fan of mysteries  and mystery was the very first genre that got me reading  and this book is the most thrilling mystery I ve ever read  I would recommend this to a fan of mystery thriller  I loved this book  If I m going to be honest I did prefer this a little more than Gone Girl  But not by much This is full of suspense  fast paste  thrilling  great character building and overall amazing  capturing story  Already want to read it again  From the start I really connect with Rachael and her depression they way that she was feeling after the break down of her marriage  I cant quite put my finger on why I connected to her so much  but from her first  I guess Diary entry  I really just felt for her character and enjoyed her part of the story  And the way that she tried to help others even though they could not see what she was trying to do  Megan on the other hand took me a while to get used to  But in the end I still didn t really connect with her as much as I did Rachael  I didn t like the Megan was a player and that she didn t see the harm in what she was doing with other guys and the affect it was having on her husband  Scott   But she did not deserve the ending that she got  Now Anna  you didn t really get as much of her story as you did Rachael and Megan but the parts of her story that you did get I was drawn in  She was a mother to loved her child and would do anything for the safety of her child  She had to put up with so much  but she did all that for her child  That was honestly the only real thing that I liked about Anna  Because I identified with Rachael so much the tension between them two I didn t like but it did help the story in the end This is very much all about the girl power  But also about physical abuse and in some ways mental abuse from a partner  But overall AMAZING    x Fantastic late night read  Thoroughly enjoyed the mystery and twists  the author keeps you wanting more  Twisted and sinister   a guilty pleasure indeed  Every once in a while I read a book that takes my breath away  The Girl On The Train is just such a book  To say that it is a psychological thriller just does not give full value to the plot line  Rachel  the star     of the book is a complete mess with her life splattered across alternate chapters  You don t know what to think of her  fear  loathing  sympathy  Since she lost her husband life continues down hill  To fill her idle time she creates story lines  lives for the people she sees from the train window as she goes to no job in the city  and to no life of her own  Things take a dramatic turn when one of the women she has seen over the weeks and months goes missing Rachel gets herself involved to an extreme extent  you can only guess her motives as she goes from one drink to another  one lie to another I can see why this book is so popular  Not sure another mystery can ever compete Very good page turner for author s first novel  Well written characters that made you hate them  like them  cheer for them  yell at them  and want to shake some sense into them  I would recommend this book to others  Loved reading this book and I am eager to watch the movie  when it comes out   It has a similar tone to Gone Girl but is creepier  towards the end  and faster paced  A fantastic  gripping thriller  I would recommend this to anyone who likes thriller  Book is so engaging  captures all the character s perspective and feelings  Rachael  who is one of the character   is a messed up girl who want to do some thing that is meaningful  Rachael who commutes everyday by train  likes to observe from train and build her version of story  She was particularly attracted to a couple  whom she named Jess and Jason and weaved a happy life around them  Her intrigue on Jess and Jason s life  when she finds Jess missing is the one that helps her to come back to reality and bring her life back to track  The start is calming but don t be fooled because it s simply setting the scene for you  then you re thrown into this mystery making it almost impossible to stop reading  Full review here  http   msphoenixgilmore wordpress com    Everyone said this was a great book and they were right  It s page turning mystery  set in the outskirts of London  Paul Hawkins gets into the minds and emotions of her characters as they deal with an event that sadly  has become almost commonplace in today s headlines   Along the same lines as GONE GIRL  this is a great thriller with many unexpected twists  Although vital to the story  I found Rachel  the protagonist  to be rather annoying  I really liked the way the story was laid out  and I had a hard time putting it down  This was a great read  First 100 pages I was a bit confused  I tried hard to connect the missing pieces  but they just wouldn t come together  That intrigued me very much since there aren t many books these days that leave me wondering  As the novel progressed and I started developing various theories about characters and the murded itself I realized how much I enjoyed reading this novel  Most of my theories ended up slightly or completely wrong  but that gave me even more satisfaction since I felt as if I was having an amazing dialogue with a very wise interlocutor I must admit the main character  Rachel Watson was quite unappealing  She disguisted me from the first page with how little control she had over he life and everything in it  I tried to undestand he  but I always found myself diguisted I recomend this book   This was the best fiction book I ve ever read  Except I didn t read it myself  I let the beautiful voices on Audible read them to me  Typically I can t listen to audible books unless they are non fiction  because I lose my place or forget to pay attention  or forget who is talking  This book never once let me forget  The voices were so well done  so distinct  and always reminded me where I was in he story  I would recommend the audio to everyone because it truly enhanced my experience  Mind you  the voices are British  I m a Licensed Professional Counselor  so I read it with a counselor s vantage point  The transference part of the book where Megan  falls in love with her therapist  was very believeable  I would call this book a psychological killer  It s like a Dateline episode  only much more detailed  You are constantly inside the three women s head  Rachel is the divorced women who likes to drink on the train  As she does  she stares out the window and projects pretend lives onto the people she sees  She is bitter because she couldn t get pregnant Anna is the  other woman   She marries Rachel s  ex  Tom  and has a baby  A baby that Rachel had hoped to have  Megan and Scott are the couple that Rachel sees from the train window  They live in a house near the one where she used to live with Tom  Rachel imagines they live in perfect bliss  As the story unfolds  you will find each woman  and each man  have something to hide At times the action slows  so you can hear the voices inside the characters  but never for a minute does this dark psychological train slow down   Very readable and well written considering the pacing and suspense  I definitely got some weird looks from my classmates and even teachers when I told them I was reading this book and genuinely enjoying it but  personally  I found this book really difficult to put down The first few pages might be a little confusing but do not let that fool you  Carry on reading  it will get you hooked  Some chapters might feel a little heavier than others  but they all seem to add something important to the story  Maybe some were slow paced  but certainly not a filler chapter  which I would ve hated There s some amazing character development in this novel  which is also very far from unrealistic  Well  the entire novel is far from that I love plot twists in books  and the final 20 30 pages of this book completely turn the story around in such a way that leaves you with a feeling of excitement and anticipation  but everything still manages to make perfect sense  and all the pieces of the story fit together perfectly All in all  great thriller  great novel  10 10 would recommend   With starred reviews from Publishers Weekly and Kirkus Reviews and a soon to be in the works movie  The Girl on the Train  the debut novel from former Journalist Paula Hawkins  is already one of the most buzzed about titles of 2015  Even before this book was published it was talked about in  hottest fiction auction of the summer  terms and you know that those eye roll inducing words  next Gone Girl  have been mentioned somewhere along the lines  too  This kind of hype can make or break a book for me  and it s often true that when a book attracts this much pre publication buzz  it s hard to live up to all that publisher acclaim  Especially for a debut But The Girl on the Train is no ordinary debut  As for living up to all that pre publication buzz   this book has no problems on that front either Read the rest of this review  http   daisychainbookreviews blogspot    The beginning was a touch slow for me but once it picked up it Had me on the edge of my seat until the very end  Wow  what an incredible book  Thrilling and suspenseful  I truly loved it  Annoying at the beginning but scary and interesting at the end  I m not normally a thriller reader  but when friends recommended the book I thought I d give it a go  safe in the knowledge that  having recently given myself permission to stop reading part way through  I didn t have to finish it  No need for that  I thoroughly enjoyed it and found myself sucked into the story like drowning in quicksand  I liked the way chapters were told from the three principal women s points of view and had dates to tell you when the action took place  The characters were really well described and I wondered if the author had personal experience of alcoholism in particular  since so many little phrases rang true  There were other elements which made me wonder the same thing  though I won t spoil the story for you  It was a real page turner with the tension building perfectly towards the end   I stayed up late to finish it  I was aching to see what the conclusion would be yet resisted the temptation to flip to the end  the writing is that good  I rarely give a book five stars  but this deserves it and I can only urge you to read it   Loved it  Never would ve guessed  Jeez   As Rachel passes the homes along the track of her daily commuter train  she imagines the stories of their lives  One couple in particular grabs her fancy and she eagerly fills in the details of  Jess   Jason s  life  Until one day  she witnesses something that just doesn t fit   and then finds she must tell the police what she saw  But will what she saw help at all Oh who to trust  who to trust among the three female narrators in this fast paced  whip through the pages thriller  How about none of them  Most all in law enforcement know how unreliable eye witness testimony can be and Paula Hawkins  shows us this with gusto Count me among those who burned through this book and lost sleep to get to the end  I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery that kept me guessing until the last 60 pages  I couldn t put this book down  Dark  chilling yet relatable and completely engaging  Great read    I think this is the sort of book Gone Girl was trying to be but failed  Oh my goodness this book is gooooood    I was totally hooked from the word go and couldn t put it down  I think I guessed who did it when I was about 60  of the way through but this didn t spoil it at all because I wanted to keep reading to see if I was right  I have read some reviews that it was uncomfortable to read and the characters to dark and flawed but to me this is what makes a good thriller  I really liked Rachel as a character and felt sorry for her  This book is written from the three main characters points of view and I feel this thickened the plot  I won t give anything away but if you are looking for a gripping thriller this book is for you  I normally don t read mystery novels  but this book has me wanting more  Ms  Hawkins did a wonderful job keeping me enthralled with every character  Rachel was unbelievably addicting to follow as her character developed  and I couldn t believe all the twists that were waiting at the end  Honestly  this novel delves deep into the reality of the worst that human nature can amount to from all angles  It makes you think twice about your decisions in life  Every single character seemed lost in their own seriously shameful worlds  and together they made an utterly engaging story  There is some serious fucking crazy going on here   3 I couldn t find too much I didn t like about it  I ordered it because it was about a  fantasist  traveling by a train in London area  Love London  and love the trains  so I was intrigued  I think Paula Hawkins does an interesting job of developing characters through first person narrating  I liked this technique a lot  Everyone is hiding something       isn t that always the truth  The main character  Rachel was pathetic  to say the least  But interesting in how she seems to be able to control her alcoholism when she needs to  I question if that s entirely possible        maybe  Still enjoyed it  A maioria das pessoas que nao gostou desse livro ja leu Gone Girl  e ficou decepcionado apos tanta comparacao entre as obras Eu  no entanto  ainda nao li Gone Girl  Nao li nenhum outro livro do genero  na verdade  Entao nao tinha nocao alguma do que esperar MAS GENTE  QUE LIVRO QUE ESCRITA QUE DESENVOLVIMENTO DE PERSONAGENS QUE TUDO  Foi bonito  foi  Foi intenso  foi   Absolutely enjoyed this book  The writing style was different than anything else I have read  The story is told from the perspective of three different people and makes excellent use of jumping backward and forward in time to carry out the slow reveal of the characters  motives  character flaws  of which there are many   and the overall timeline  But don t worry  it s not time travel  Each chapter heading includes the date time of day and the name of the character that is in first person  I found myself flipping back and forth to compare timelines and who saw what and when The emotions of the characters take center stage and the story is far richer for it  If drama stresses you out  this might now be a good book for you  I enjoyed the elegance of how the story unfolded right up to the ending I strongly recommend this book   Psychological thrillers are my favourite genre of novels and I ve read an awful lot of them  some can be wishy  washy with no real plot to speak of  The Girl on the Train however  is different  It s packed full of thrilling twists and turns  cleverly timed revelations and edge of seat tension  The story starts slowly as each chapter introduces you to the main female characters of Rachel  Anna and Megan but it is never boring and you don t find yourself wanting it to speed up or get on with it  its beautifully paced from the start I cant say that I actually liked any of the characters but I did feel sympathy with one or two as their lives clearly had not gone the way they would have liked and the story is based on the consequences of some bad decisions and actions  I probably felt the most for Megan who had a bad childhood and Rachel who life has never treated very fairly  Rachel mixes fact with fantasy until she has no idea what the truth is anymore  She needs to be part of what s going on as it gives her a reason to get up in the morning  a sense of purpose again  The plot had as many stops and starts as the train journey she takes each day  I felt I knew my way round the town of Ashbury and especially Blenheim Road by the time i d finished it It was hard to know who to believe in the end and the final pages are just stunning The author has a very smooth  easy writing style which kept me reading  always greedy for one more chapter This book deserves to be huge  I absolutely loved it Verdict  fabulous story  beautifully writtenRating  5 5  What a fantastic psychological mystery  Can t wait for this author s next book  The audible version is perfect too  with all 3 narrators very compelling   Unfortunately events ruined my momentum in reading this book but it is still a wild addictive ride  I hate the Gone Girl comparison  but if you re forcing my hand  it s better  Wow  Yes  it is all everyone says it is    This story got my attention from the first page and I truly enjoyed the whole ride  When writing this review  I was trying to find something that I didn t like about it to be fair  but couldn t find anything and this is what my 5 star rating shows  The plot basically revolves around Rachel  who takes the same commuter train every day and suddenly sees something rather than usual  that changes her life for ever  This particularly event and a few mental life crisis moments will make Rachel figure out that what is in front of you  sometimes is not always what it seems to be It is told through the voice of three different women  which gives the narrative a more clear insight and adds mystery to the story  I have read Gone Girl before and I can say is one of my favorite thrillers of all time I thought I was hardly ever gonna have the opportunity to read something similar to it  but let me tell you  I did and it was thanks to Paula Hawkins  There were sometimes that I couldn t believe what I was reading  it has an original storyline that keeps your hearth pounding  gripping and wanting for more  I totally recommend it  Favorite Quotes    Life is not a paragraph  and death is no parenthesis     I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts      It s possible to miss what you ve never had  to mourn for it    The holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mould yourself through the gaps     I ve been the fool  If he does it with you  he ll do it to you   If you re looking for a thriller  this should be your next choice  Holy crap  Couldn t put it down   Para uma opiniao com mais pormenores estejam atentos ao meu canal  https   www youtube com channel UC1vl   Para comecar este e um daqueles livros onde todas as personagens tem problemas    e sao tao reais que eu tive pena da Rachel  das outras nao tanto  Aborda temas como o alcoolismo   traicao e maus tratos Gostei muito do livro porque a autora tem algumas influencias de Agatha Christie e como sabem eu considero a a mae dos misterios e policiais e foi fantastico Fiquei fascinada com o final pois nao estava nada a espera do que aconteceu   The Girl on the Train  is a chillingly ominous psychological thriller as well as a character study of surprising depth  with Gillian Flynn levels of nail biting narrative hooks  I haven t been compelled to turn page after page after page of a book for a long time  and I m shocked to learn it s the author s debut  Kudos Paula Hawkins  The fact that it was published less than 3 weeks ago  is on its 8th printing and has had its rights optioned for a film already by DreamWorks  is information enough on the quality of this book   read it  Thrilling  I might be slow but I had it all wrong  Quick read  I couldn t put it down  5 stars for the performances as well as the well spun yarn  Thoroughly enjoyable twisty turning story aptly symbolized by the corkscrew  Yes  snicker   you have to read it to find out what that means  At once pathetic and I also laughed my way round every turn  character collisions throughout  gone round self deception and cleverly wrought murkings about until our sodden protagonist hits the big  Aha    It was perfect for a heavy driving week  Hooray  Will definitely look up more titles by this author  This book was wonderful  It completely captivated me and made me feel a full range of emotions  Rachel is a drunk  It is heart breaking  Almost from page one we see her struggling over her marriage that has long since been over  She does not have a job and is mortified about that fact  She takes the morning and evening trains so that her roommate believes she is going to and from work  Her train happens to pass her ex s street they used to live on  Instead of obsessing over watching his house  She watches a couple a few houses down that she names Jess and Jason in her head  They seem like the perfect happy couple to her  But things are not as they seem One day  Jess  aka Megan goes missing  Rachel is desperate to be in the middle of the investigation as she s seen a man other than Megan s husband kissing her  She quickly turns into an unreliable witness  between the drinking and the stalking of her ex and his new wife I had read a lot of reviews of this book over the past few months and I had read certain spoilers  Luckily I had forgotten what I had read and went in almost blind  The story is slow and is drawn out but oh so good  I didn t expect the twist at the end until about 80   It wasn t exactly new or exciting  but I found it fitting for the situation  The story is told through three different point of views  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  Rachel s ex husbands new wife  I did not like Anna at all until the last few minutes of the story  I m glad she turned a new leaf at the last second  Overall great story  I ve heard there is a movie and I ll be watching soon  This definitely was similar to Gone Girl  but I found the unreliable narrator direction much more well thought out in the is one and the characters so much more likeable  I read this so fast because I couldn t stop reading it  It had me constantly thinking  and just when I thought I may have figured something out  I changed my mind  Its suspenseful and addicting  I liked it better than Gone Girl for sure  4 5 stars  The Girl on the Train was one of the best thrillers I ve read in the last couple of years  I guessed the identity of the killer very early on  but it was still a great ride   Wow what a book     After hearing so many ppl rave about this book I had to buy it and see what the fuss was all about and boy am I glad I did  I completed this in literally a few hours from the first page I was hooked the plot kept me guessing and the characters kept me intrigued Rachel although very flawed drew me in I couldn t help but pity her and sympathise with her yet at the same time want to scream and shake some sense into her  Megan was another flawed person who I didn t particularly like but on occasion sympathised with her Anna I admit I just didn t like at all she brought it on herself the only decent thing she ever did was right at the end when you found out what really transpired with the corkscrew As for the men in this story I wont go into too much detail needless to say each had some secrets and involvement in what transpired  Also I m not going to get into the plot too much as I don t want to give too much away but I will say this book did keep me guessing although I did guess alot of it I thought that this book was amazing definitely worth a read it kept me on the edge of the seat      Satu berarti penderitaan  dua berarti kebahagiaan  tiga berarti bocah perempuan  Tiga berarti bocah perempuan  Aku tertahan pada tiga  aku tidak bisa melanjutkannya lagi  Kepalaku dipenuhi suara  mulutku dipenuhi darah  Tiga berarti bocah perempuan  Aku bisa mendengar burung burung magpie itu  mereka tertawa

down  I read it in two days  and started it over again as soon as I finished it  OMG  I wasn t sure that I d like this book because I haven t read a psychological thriller in a long time  At first it seemed mundane  yet I was only a handful of pages in    And then  Then the story shifted to another character s POV and I could see everything from that person s perspective  And then it shifted yet again  giving me glimpses into the lives of a variety of characters so that little by little I was allowed clues as to what was happening  This is a story of deception  the lies we tell ourselves and others  the way lines get blurred by emotions or alcohol  skeletons hidden in the closet  and the secrets that we keep  It s a story about how things aren t always what they seem  and Hawkins had me turning pages to find out who was up to what  The greatest part  Each time I decided I knew exactly what was going on  Hawkins led me down another path to make me question if what I believed was happening was the truth  This is a must read book that will make you want to call in sick just so you can finish it   Please note that I didn t use a sick day  but I read through lunch breaks and at every spare moment I had  desperate to discover the truth behind everything that happened to the girl on the train  and desperate to know who was going to survive the madness   I learned about the new best seller everybody s calling the new Gone Girl a few weeks back  After reading the freebie sample of Paula Hawkins The Girl on the Train on my Nook  I really wanted to get my hands on an actual hard copy of the page turner  so I could  you know  turn the pages  But the book was just published January 13th so it s still in hardback and at  23 has been flying off the shelves  selling like hotcakes  number one with a bullet on the New York Times Bestseller List  so I decided to download it to my Nook for just under ten bucks instead  I tore through it  it s hard not to  it s so nail bitingly good  I wish I had the actual book though  speeding train on the cover and all  hanging around and cluttering up my bedside table to remind me  write it up  write it up  write it up Here I am  finally getting around to it  The thing is  it s hard to write this one up  I don t want to ruin a second of the pleasure of your reading it  your nail chewing at the discoveries story moves forward and reveals itself  I always have this trouble with mysteries  not quite knowing what to say and what to keep back Let s see  I can safely say it s about a  girl   why are we still calling women  girls    who takes the train to and from London everyday  and who sees something from the train window  I can say the book was optioned by DreamWorks almost a year ago  long before its 2015 publication date  for producer Marc Platt to make into a film  I can say that he s already hired a screenwriter to work on the screenplay adaptation  Erin Cressida Wilson  I was hoping with a middle name like  Cressida  she d be British because I think a writer with a British sensibility is less likely to say they can switch it to the Long Island Rail Road and have Rachel  the main character  taking the train to Manhattan from Long Island and back every day  Er  no thanks  Sadly  she s an American but both her parents were English teachers so hopefully she s got that built in love and respect for the written word  Even when the written word isn t exactly Shakespeare  because while it s not literature with a capital L  it s very  very good  and as scary and unstoppable as a speeding train  You may have heard The Girl on the Train is a story with a marital problem or two  along with an  unreliable  narrator  In truth  we have three narrators  Rachel  Megan and Anna  Reliable  Unreliable  That all depends on your point of view  And point of view is definitely much of the fun of this book First  Rachel  She is the girl in The Girl on the Train  an alcoholic divorcee who takes the train into the city everyday  mesmerized by the small strip of homes that back the train tracks as she passes  As an old realtor like me can tell you  property that backs the train tracks looks a whole lot more desirable from the train  than it does from the backyard of those homes  the train whistle sounding day in  day out  Still  Rachel romanticizes the view from the train  and can t take her eyes off one attractive looking couple who spend a fair amount of time on their deck  They are a perfect golden couple  He is dark haired and well built  strong  protective  kind  He has a great laugh  She is one of those tiny bird women  a beauty  pale skinned with blond hair cropped short  She has the bone structure to carry that kind of thing off  sharp cheekbones dappled with a sprinkling of freckles  a fine jaw   p  11Rachel  lonely and self loathing  even fantasizes about the male member of the golden couple    I can imagine the feel of his hands  the weight of them  reassuring and protective  Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful physical contact with another person  just a hug or a heartfelt squeeze of my hand  and my heart twitches  Reliable Unreliable  She s an alcoholic  hiding her drinking  constantly going off and on the wagon  She was as frustrating to me as a couple of alcoholics I ve known in my own life  making futile promises they re not ready to keep  How can you take anything they seriously  Does she invent  misremember  It really is difficult to take her point of view at face value  Unreliable at best  I still found myself rooting for her  wanting to shake her  stop her from doing what I could see she was about to do Megan  the perfect blonde woman Rachel sees from the train is not exactly the woman Rachel imagines her to be  Not beneath the surface  The Megan we meet  one year earlier  is much less satisfied with the life she s living than Rachel imagines  In fact they re not all that different  Megan indulges in fantasy and wishful thinking too  pretending she s living in a pretty house in the Cinque Terre  which must also rattle as the train whistles past  and not here in this suburban strip of homes  She s married yes  but she s adrift  unemployed  unsatisfied  she is  in fact  seeing a shrink  My days feel empty now I don t have the gallery to go to any longer  I really miss it  I miss talking to the artists  I even miss dealing with all those tedious yummy mummies who used to drop by  Starbucks in hand  to gawk at the pictures  telling their friends that little Jessie did better pictures than that in nursery school  p  23Lastly there is Anna who we hear a lot about from both Rachel and Megan  but don t hear anything from until we re a third of the way through the novel  Anna used to be a real estate agent  me too   but now she s a seemingly happily married stay at home mother to an adorable baby girl  She lives in the same strip of homes back the tracks  On days like today  with the sun shining  when you walk down our little street  tree lined and tidy  not quite a cu de sac  but with the same sense of community  it could be perfect  Its pavements are busy with mothers just like me  with dogs on leads and toddlers on scooters  It could be ideal  It could be  if you weren t able to hear the screeching brakes of the trains  p  100Three women  all about the same age  late twenties  early thirties  living  trapped   in suburbia  Three intersecting stories and it all begins with Rachel  When Rachel sees what she sees from the train window  we follow her muddied thinking  her cloudy vision to find out the truth  I couldn t stop reading  it was like a magnet just kept me attached to the page  pulling me along and along  I m not going to tell you any more  It really is too good of a read I m already thinking about the casting Rachel  the drinker  once a dark haired beauty is called  fat   bloated from drink and her depressive personality  I doubt she s fat in any truly obese way  but she sees herself that way  She s probably 10 or possibly 20 pounds overweight  out of control and unhappy  Someone like Martine McCutcheon who played Natalie in Love Actually  except not as ebullient and comfortable in her own skin Megan and Anna are both pretty  petite blondes  Carey Mulligan  Joanne Froggat  Emilia Clarke come to mind Joanne Froggatt  Downton Abbey  seen here as Lexie in The Secret BBC television seriesCarey Mulligan in DriveAs for the menRachel tells us that Megan s husband is handsome in a British film star kind of way  not a Depp or a Pitt  but a Firth  or a Jason Isaacs  Thanks for doing the work for us Rachel  Is Colin Firth too old  NEVER  But if you disagree  then who would you put in his place And Megan tells us Anna s husband  flashes his Tom Cruise smile   So why not Tom Cruise  Did you see him opposite Emily Blunt in The Edge of Tomorrow  He was fantastic  as was the film  Too old  Again I say  who would you pick  Chris Hemsworth  Chris Pines Then there s Megan s yummy shrink    His name is Dr  Kamal Abdic  I guess he must be midthirties  although he looks very young with his incredible dark honey skin  No question about this one  That sounds like Sendhil Ramamurthy from the television series Beauty and the Beast to me URGGHH  UPDATE  While I love the women cast in the film  Emily Blunt as Rachel  Rebecca Ferguson as Anna and Haley Bennet as Megan  I m distressed at the rumored casting of Chris Evans as Tom and Jared Leto as Megan s husband  Scott  And I m really ticked that they ve relocated the setting to NYC  This is a train  this girl wants to get off Have you read the book yet  Who would you cast as The Girl on the Train  The concept of this book was extremely clever  Totally original and well played out  There were a couple of things that I wish the author had taken into consideration  I believe it would be almost impossible to have a baby and have virtually no one know about it  That part was an important part of the story  but wasn t believable at all  That the main character was an alcoholic was a daring and brilliant thing to do  It made her completely untrustworthy and a bit unlikable  but still  she was telling the truth the whole time  Definitely a worthwhile read   Fast paced read  Once I got into the story  I couldn t put it down   For the moment I m giving this 5 stars  but in the light of day I might rethink that  It s not a great book  after all  It s just a great read A lot of people compare it to Gone Girl  and it s similar only in the sense that it s narrated by multiple characters  and it s hard to know how much to trust what they say  But this was so much more satisfying to read  I enjoyed every page and didn t get pissed off the way I did when I d finished Gone Girl I can t imagine that this won t get made into a movie  and I ll be looking forward to seeing it  I don t often read thrillers and maybe that s why I loved this one so much NOW SPOILERS   All the while Rachel is portrayed to be the faulty one and the one who is at fault  There were moments when I believed she did kill Megan  I didn t want to believe it  but it would have added up  Then I thought maybe it was Scott after all  Hell  I even thought it could have been Rachel  On the other hand  the affair between Megan and Tom didn t come as a surprise at all  Tom s psychopathic behavior on the other hand did  In the end  of course  it all makes perfect sense  The way he s acting and the way he never really does let go of Rachel and still tries to be her knight in shining armour  his words after all  What I love most about this in the end is how Rachel s addiction is the most obvious one  But they all are addicted to or obsessed with something  And all of these addictions are taking them down a path of destruction  Like a train  really  which always has a  final  destination   It s 3 45 a m and i just finished this book  I know this review will probability upload when i have better internet conection  maybe in the morning  I m a mess  This book was like a rollercoaster and i loved every part of it  First of all  I really liked the fact that this book was realistic  Rachel s addiction  her fears  Megan s and Scott s life  Anna s thoughts on Rachel and her behaviour  I had 25 pages left of this book when i realized no one is the true hero of the story  I found myself shocked when we found out about Scott  because he seemed like the good guy in the story  with only a couple of issues  The most normal out of everyone When we find out about Tom s second affair  it clicked  I suddenly knew that Tom s the bad guy  and for some reason I had a really bad feeling about him  It couldn t be just a simple affair  I started to think that  woah  so many women are after Tom  and that somehow  all of them ended up bad  Anna was starting to follow Rachel s lead and I think that is the moment when i realized At times  i was annoyed with Rachel because she just couldn t give up drinking but I guess it it the sad  realistic true to the world detail Even though Rachel s perspective made me hate Anna  her actions  contacting officer Riley  feeling watched and not having a general good experience in that house are normal things  and I would react the same  I would fear for my child knowing the fact that the unstable ex wife of my husband tried to take it  After all the harassing with the calls and the fights with Rachel I would do the same thing Anna did  And this is another thing I loved about the book  The fact that even though in the start  she is supposedly the bad wolf  it is because thats how Rachel saw it  But  it made me despise Anna because she did some of those things because she didnt care about Rachel perspective  I adored the kind of methapor the author did  with Jess and Jason  and Scott and Megan  If people saw them from the ouside  they would think that they were the exact perfect couple Rachel told us about on the train  But in reality there are a lot of secrets  a lot of tragedy and pain  I think that happens in real life too  because we think something of people  judging on some moments we saw  not knowing the whole truth I loved the ending  I somehow knew from the beginning that it s going to end with Rachel having to catch the train  And I was really pleased when it happened

Bet sis sikums nav ta verts  lai atnemtu sai gramatai zvaigzni  The Girl on the Train is absolutely riveting  Told in chunks by three women all somehow connected  the story revolves around a murder  A murder of one of the three women  Rachel is an alcoholic who s lost her job  her husband and her dignity  She travels back and forth to London every day  watching the world whizz by around her along the way  Then one day while looking out at a particular house she witnesses something terrible Megan is hard to describe  Throughout the book she kept on surprising me  She definitely isn t the person you think she is   with a shady past and some serious skeletons in her closet you just never know what she s going to do next  Anna is a mother and a wife  Her husband  Tom  is Rachel s ex husband  Anna is constantly paranoid because her family keeps getting harassed by Rachel  It s as though Rachel just won t let go of the fact that her husband has moved on  When the murder happens and the investigation begins  things become extremely messy for all three women  I couldn t put this book down  It is staggeringly perfect  Mysterious  thrilling  dark and delightful   The Girl on the Train has already received amazing advanced praise from reviewers all over the world and I have to say that I really enjoyed it too  I won t be surprised if this book does exceptionally well in 2015  Rachel gets the same train every day to work and every day it stops at the same signal  Rachel loves peering into the garden of the house it stops at and imagining the life of the perfect couple who lives there  Until one day  she sees something that shatters this illusion and she gets drawn into a terrifying chain of events  I was interested in this book because it had been likened to the book Gone Girl  which I enjoyed very much  And yes  there are similarities between The Girl on the Train in its storyline  style of writing and the way it keeps you guessing until the end  The characters were built up very well and there are chapters that are dedicated to three of the main women in the story  You do have to pay attention to the dates of each chapter as well though  which I didn t and got a little bit confused at times  but as long as you re on the ball it s quite easy to work out where you are in the story  I loved this book and I would certainly recommend it  It kept me guessing and kept me hooked  And the ending came as a surprise to me as well   I certainly wasn t expecting it  I had been missing a good thriller mystery book in my life this year and I think I have finally found it  I was lucky enough to be given an advanced reading copy from the publishers through Netgalley and Girl on the Train will be released on 15th January 2015  Read on a luxury train in Canada on vacation  I must say  the most fun I have had reading a book in awhile  I can see why this book is off the charts on buzz and bestselling lists  Paula Hawkins first novel filled my mind with dread  hope  and curiosity as I road along on the Rocky Mountaineer in Canada  The characters were real and tangible  The motion of the train felt like a character in the book as well  I was asked at lunch in the dining car by my traveling fab four family who my favorite actress is  and I said  Emily Blunt  I was ecstatic when I finished the book and read online that she is starring in the film adaptation  but also disappointed they are moving the location to New York  I loved the London aspect of it and those London residents on the train  I look forward to her next book  Thank you Paula Hawkins for awaking me back into the fiction genre  I have been reading much non fiction this year and also been writing a lot myself  so just a joy to lose myself in a G R E A T BOOK Took a minute to get me hooked  but I couldn t put it down by the end  This novel has been compared to Gone Girl which I really enjoyed  I may even have liked this one a tiny bit better  The girl on the train is one of three female narrators  I like the device of the train because the story rushes along like a train speeding down a track if that isn t too corny Reading this novel was for me like assembling a jig saw puzzle  OK here s a bit of information ie a puzzle piece  And it seems to fit here  And here s another  And I m three quarters through the book and the picture has yet to appear We do learn that a murder has been committed  A girl s body has been found  One of the three narrators in fact  And eventually I did stumble upon the truth  But not until a number of false assumptions and blind alleys and pieces that I tried to force into places they didn t belong In the end all was revealed and it all made sense  A very satisfying psychological thriller that I felt was deserving of the critical praise it has received  I thoroughly enjoyed the ride  I LOVED  ENJOYED AND RELISHED IT  So I have just finished this book and the reason why it took me forever to finish it  though it was a very short book  is because I got into a reading slump  Sad right  But even though I got into a reading slump the book  and the characters were always in my head  yes I wasn t reading it  but I was thinking about it 24 7  The multiple protagonists is not something I usually like  but in this book I truly loved it  And also the multiple protagonists were so messed up and crazy in different ways that I was always looking up to read from their point of view I m not good at solving crimes apparently  because I didn t see that coming  Like at all  But I have always hated him   people who read the book will know who am I talking about     If you re wondering about this book  I assure you it s not a waste of time  Go and pick it  and enjoy the thrill of it   I just finished this yesterday and can t stop thinking about how much I liked it  The last book I read that was compared to Gone Girl was a dire disappointment so I was wary about this and the surrounding hype  But not only was this a gripping read that got me hooked as much as Gone Girl  I also found myself caring about most of the characters much more I was rooting for Rachel despite her maddening flaws and thought she was a much more likeable character than anything I had read about the book had made be expect  I also despised Anna with a passion  which for a writer really is as much of an achievement as making you like someone Adding to that the genuinely satisfying twists and turns  even the foreseeable ones felt kind of surprising somehow  and the cracking  entertaining read  I can only recommend this to anyone who enjoys a well written psychological thriller and to some who just like to read a good book  The Girl on the Train is everything anyone could ever want in a mystery and more  This book had me hooked from the start and I could NOT put it done  The book is told from the perspectives of three women who all have one big thing in common  you will have to read the book in order to find out what that thing is  Rachel tells a good portion of the story  she is divorced and can t seem to move on from her past life with her husband  did I mention she is also an alcoholic  She takes a train everyday of the week to and from her  job   on this ride she likes to look out at the houses it passes  especially number 23  In number 23 is a happy looking couple she calls Jason and Jess  Rachel doesn t know those are their names though and she has never even spoken to them yet she feels a bond with them  One day when the train is passing number 23 Rachel sees something that changes how she sees Jason and Jess forever  soon after this sighting Jess goes missing  Rachel s world spirals even more out of control and soon she tries to get involved with Jess s disappearance  Soon Rachel becomes connected with Jason and Jess in ways she never thought possible  Rachel has to become stronger in order to remember the truth because when she remembers everything will change for her  forever  So obviously I loved this book  The plot kept thickening and thickening making it impossible for me to put it down  Every time I thought I had this one figured out Hawkins would throw me a curveball and I d be heading back to the dugout  Every single character in this book is majorly flawed with something such as being an alcoholic  abuser  cheater or even a psychotic mom  This is also a set of characters that you love to hate  I hated them all  I mean at times I liked Rachel  but then she would go do something stupid and I d get angry all over again  This is has easily become my favorite mystery  So happy I picked this gem up  Originally posted on Paris Baker s Book Nook Wow  This was an incredibly unsettling book   and I mean that in the best possible way The narrative is split between 3 women  Rachel  Anna and Megan The story is mainly from Rachel s viewpoint  the girl on the train  Spurned by her ex husband  Tom  who now lives a seemingly cosy life with his new wife  and former mistress   Anna  and their young daughter  Rachel has sought solace at the bottom of a bottle  and her life has taken a nose dive in recent years  With everything in tatters around her  Rachel takes comfort in the routine of her daily journey to and from London on the train  She watches the houses and people she passes  as many people do  and has even started to make up names and lives for some of them  particularly  Jason and Jess   She has built up a perfect life for this couple   carefree and in love  and all the things her and Tom were meant to be When she witnesses something that starts to shatter the fantasy she has built  Rachel is deeply disturbed and  unable to let things lie  finds herself getting involved  But with drunken blackouts and hazy memories both commonplace in Rachel s life  she s not exactly a reliable or trustworthy witness  Paula has done a truly fantastic job with Rachel s character as protagonist  She is unpredictable and unreliable  she possesses multiple undesirable traits  and yet I couldn t help finding her somewhat endearing  There s a sort of earnest about  so that even when I wasn t sure I could trust her  I was willing her to be right  to be honest and to be acting with the best intentions Anna just wants to settle into her new life with husband and baby without any interference from Tom s ex wife  who won t leave him alone  and Megan s life isn t quite as perfect as it may outwardly seem There is not a single character in the plot who you can altogether trust  and I found my loyalty was constantly shifting throughout the story  as more information was slowly filtered in   some seemingly helpful and some making you question everything you d thought thus far  Either way  it had me greedily reading each page as quickly as possible to find out what happened  raising the questions  what happens behind closed doors  who doesn t have secrets  who can you really trust  and when you re losing your memory to alcohol induced amnesia  can you even trust yourself This book was marvellously mysterious  with a thrilling increase of pace throughout as the tension increased  A must read for the psychological thriller lover   easily set to be the Gone Girl of 2015  Me ha acabado encantando  Tenia las expectativas muy altas y no sabia si iba a terminar gustandome  pero la verdad es que me ha tenido enganchada durante horas  3 horas sin mentiros  Me ha gustado mucho la pluma de la autora y como ha llevado a cabo y logrado mantener la intriga sobre el asesinato  Hasta las ultimas paginas no hubiera podido saber quien y que pasaba  No suelo leer muchos thrillers pero este me ha encantado  Quizas no es TAN exageradamente bueno para el boom que tuvo pero me ha gustado mucho  Lo mas importante es que me ha mantenido atrapada entre sus paginas  no he sabido que ocurria hasta que la misma autora me lo ha desvelado y ademas  la autora describe muy bien y ha habido ocasiones  al final  en las que hasta tenia yo mas miedo que las propias protagonistas  Muy recomendable    Empezamos bien este 2016   The author did a really good job with keeping the reader guessing on what s happening throughout the whole book  This book made me want to read just one more chapter  just one more chapter  Im not a quick reader  but this one kept me interested enough to read as much as i could with the time available  I would reccommend this book to anyoneand everyone   Ooh  I did enjoy this To be read in one or two sittings if time allows  or in the dead of night while all is quiet around  The first 30 or so pages take a while to work out what s going on  but from then on in the pace is relentless and you have a proper potboiler on your hands  Reminded me of  Before I Go to Sleep  and  Just What Kind of Mother are You   also great page turners The use of the varied first person narrative ensures you are constantly wrong footed  and the use of a protagonist who drinks more than she ought is such a clever technique  Best to swept along by it and not try too hard to guess  who done what   Am sure it irritated the socks off some readers  but it s a fresh take on the thriller  and having a neurotic alcoholic as anti heroine does work brilliantly within the frame and plot of the story  there are a couple of scenes depicted that ring home and are a bit too close to the bone   oh the perils of having that extra glass     Read full review at literary ramblings etc An amazing debut novel definitely worth the hype  All though I heard a lot of hype about this book no reviews I watched gave anything away about the plotand I wasn t even sure if it was more of a horror or a crime thriller mystery  I think it s best to go in without knowing much or with any expectations The writing style format       This helps set up a rhythm and makes it even more of a page turnerCharacters      No one was perfect  There is nothing I find more aggravating then reading a book where all the protagonists are perfect  flawless characters  It stops them from being relatable and everyone makes mistakes and everyone has flaws  I am yet to meet someone who doesn t  This book perfectly portrayed all the narrators and other characters  it meant that we didn t know who to trust  who we liked  who we didn t  I didn t figure anything out  Paula Hawkins definitely got me  There was a short point in the story where I got  pretty close  to the reveal but it was completely wrong still and after I read on a bit it completely took me on another thought trail  Plot and pacing      Fantastic  I won t talk about the plot because I really don t want to give anything away  all I will say is enjoy  There are quite a few darker moments and topics that this book touches on  so there may be some trigger warnings for readers but I don t want to go into them in case of spoilers   I still do highly recommend this book however and if you are a bit cautious about triggers and this book please feel free to ask me and I ll go into more info without spoiling as much as possible   That arch cad Sir James Goldsmith is supposed to have remarked   When you marry your mistress you create a job vacancy   That s an observation one character in Girl on the Train should have kept in mind  Most of the time I m disappointed by the latest book ballyhooed towards the box office  Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl was hugely overrated   we connoisseurs of the outre preferred Sharp Objects   S  J  Watson s Before I Go to Sleep was   appropriately   even more yawn inducing au cinema than on the page  But Paula Hawkins utterly captivated me with Girl on the Train With different voices for the three narrators  it was ideal as a travelling audio book  Each spoke a middle class dialect but with subtle gradations   does one say du vay or du vee  Rachel sounded poshest  appropriate because her mother seems to have some money  She is the title   principal character   I identified totally with her   well understand what it feels like to be so sensitive to embarrassing situations where we might be criticised or rejected as to go to absurd lengths to avoid them  The therapist  himself a suspect  she consults  ought to have spotted Avoidant Personality Disorder   had her try Propananol   We chaplains all think we are brilliant diagnosticians   Rachel commutes by train into London every day lest her landlady roommate find out Rachel s been sacked for drunkenness  Like Rachel  I know what it s like to use alcohol to assuage the pain of failed relationships    like her I am a people watcher who imagines stories about them  Rachel is a lot like some of Helen Fitzgerald s principal characters  but with a more tragic flavour  Like Fitzgerald s characters  Rachel s 1st response to an awkward situation is lying   not out of any effort to deceive but to avoid appearing foolish  Unfortunately when she attempts to  come forward    I ve always wondered  forward  to where    is it near the  aside  you step to when you re surplus to requirements   the  on  where you re supposed to move to when you re dumped  as Rachel was by her ex husband Tom  When she goes to the police she s labelled a drunk   a fantasist  Besides having seen the victim kissing a strange man the day she disappeared  Rachel thinks she also may have been in the neighbourhood that same night  but being subject to blackouts Rachel can recall but a few hazy details  The reader wants to scream  Stop lying     Rachel   ultimately the best way to deal with embarrassment is going flat out with the truth   leaving the lying to the sociopaths   there s   least one in this book as well as an unpleasant   incompetent cop The other narrators are Megan  the victim    Anna  Rachel s ex s current   mother of his child  I found Megan darkly attractive  being from King s Lynn helped   She s very unlike the happy golden girl Rachel imagined   an ex 15y o wild child with a literal skeleton in her past   like Rachel extremely needy but her weakness is not ETOH but sex  I expect most of us will dislike Anna  but she s wonderfully drawn   believable   the voice her reader gives us is priceless   her pronunciation of Merlot pegs her perfectly For me the difference between a four   five star book is that the former provides several hours of stimulating   innocuous pleasure but the latter also alters    least in a small way  who I am   how I see the world  Girl on the Train did that for me  I read these books not only to find the solution to the mystery  but for the characters   relationships   moral   spiritual values  Here they all work together to bring about a very satisfying ending  This book disturbed me greatly   more than a read has for a long time  I ve actually felt quite unsettled and discontented during the four days it has taken me to read and finish  I m not sure whether that means I should have rated it a one or a five The opening pages of Rachel s life were something I could relate to in an alarming way   the loneliness  lack of direction  feeling of failure and not belonging mixed with the commute and crowds of London is certainly a journey I have been through both literally and figuratively  I had my Jess and Jason  and wonderful stories based on certain houses as I passed twice a day  As each female character was explored further the similarities to my own life was un nerving and quite uncomfortable  With the modern family being geographically disjointed  and the reliance on friends  what happens to all three female characters is plausible   in fact scarily so I loved the writing style  and the twists  and will be reading Hawkins  next novel the minute it is out this summer  I don t often read murder mysteries  but when I do I like ones that are riveting and perfectly paced  without extraneous tangents or predictable conclusions  The Girl on the Train fit these requirements beautifully  Add to that  fully imagined characters  a plot that would make a spellbinding movie  and imagery that befits the mood and authentic feel of the storyline  and you ve got the perfect murder mystery  For the fans of Gone Girl esque type stories  you will thoroughly enjoy The Girl on the Train  Told in revolving narrators  you really explore this twisted and suspenseful story    First let me say  there has been so much hype about this book I put off reading it for a few weeks  I suppose I was reluctant to read it seeing as a book buddy of mine said she was struggling with it  I know we have similar tastes in books usually When something is hyped up so much you tend to have your expectations so high that it fails to be met by the time you get around to reading it  or if its a film    watching it This is primarily a story of three individual women  Rachel takes the front row I think  she is the Girl on the Train  She is used to travelling back and forth on the train to work  The passes the home where she used to live with her ex  Now her ex is with someone else Once I got used to each chapter being written under the guise of each person  made a note of the date of the heading of each chapter in my head it all sort of came into play really  First it was really like travelling on a train     slowly at the start  then you get right into the experience and you don t want to get off  This is how I felt about reading this What I loved about this story was  it was different  Paula Hawkins and a well thought out story here that keeps you travelling onwards  I really couldn t get off the wreckage of this storyline  the twist at the end was good  really good  Because of reading so many books each year  once in a while you get a book that really stands out from all the others  and this is the one  What a wonderful start to my reading experiences for the New Year of 2015 By the way  the concept to it being compared to Gone Girl  don t you believe it  its nothing like it  This is brilliant in its own right I would like to thank Random House UK  Transworld Publishers Via Net Galley for the opportunity to read such an excellent book  There are too few and at the same time too many words to describe how amazingly engaging and enthralling this book is  I love being sucked into a book from the start and this one did that  for sure  I couldn t put it down and hated to see it end  I m both sad and excited that this is Paula Hawkins  first novel  Sad because I d be starting another of her books right now if there was one  but ecstatic at the thought that she is  new   I can only hope she has more in the works  because this was hands down one of the most intriguing and captivating books I ve ever read  I had heard so many enthusiastic reviews about this novel  both on Booktube and on here that I decided to see for myself if it matched the hype  I m not really a contemporary fiction fan  my genre being the classics and the nineteenth century  but I have to say  I haven t enjoyed a book as much as this in ages  I literally could not put it down  so much so that I managed to put sugar in the curry sauce for dinner instead of salt  It is THAT gripping  The polyphonic narratives from Rachel  Megan  and Anna almost take the form of police statements  as if the reader is part of a jury to whom they are relating events  times of events  particular details  this narrative bringing to mind the type used by Wilkie Collins in The Woman In White  also a suspense murder crime novel but from the last century  The plot line twists and turns  unlike the straightness of a typical railway line   trains and railways playing a large part in the setting of this novel  and I have to say  the ending made me actually YELL at the characters involved      I won t say any more in case of spoilers  Suffice to say  I am exhausted  Phew Fantastic book  highly recommended  I m going to be raving about this one for weeks on my blog     There s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home    And with those words  Paula Hawkins begins a rewardingly harrowing journey which oftentimes barrels ahead at a pace matching that of the train protagonist Rachel Watson takes daily  Her journey is one that is difficult to read and uncomfortable at times but making it all the way to the final station with her is a rewarding experience As a summary  the book follows Rachel Watson  primarily  although there are two other narrators as well  who is a  recovering   alcoholic riding the train in and out of London every day  As she passes by the homes she used to live in  she becomes fascinated by one couple she sees out on their terrace almost daily  the Hipwells  Scott and Megan  who she begins to become attached to from afar  After Megan goes missing  Rachel takes it upon herself to do everything she can to help the police investigate the disappearance and suspected murder of this woman she has developed a strong emotional attachment to  Along the way  Rachel has to deal with her ex husband Tom Watson and his new wife  Anna  who is a real bitch if you ask me   while trying not to lose herself to her own demons   I have lost control over everything  even the places in my head   Before I even picked up this book  people kept telling me that is was very similar to Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl  While I love Flynn s seminal work  I would have to disagree with the overall characterization of the books as being these sort of  sister novels   The similarities are surface level at best  there s a murder investigation and the books utilize multiple unreliable narrators  and don t really reflect the deeper themes and or structure of the tales  Hawkins  tale is told with a much more broken timeline due to Rachel s status as an alcoholic  We  as readers  only become aware of events when she herself is able to sort out her memories from the black booze filled haze to which she lost them I never really liked any of the narrators  Rachel  Megan and  unfortunately  Anna   This isn t because of anything that Hawkins did in her writing  In fact  each character is written very fully and distinctly  But at the end of the day they are all just bad people  It is oftentimes painful to read Rachel s portions of the book  of which there are many  because her life is on a constantly downward spiral  Just when you think things can t get worse for her  they can and they do  Anna does nothing to help Rachel s situation  as she is constantly paranoid that the ever unhinging Rachel is hanging around her family a little too much  In Anna s defense  she did show much more character development than I had anticipated  I expected her to simply be  the other woman  but she became so much more  Megan  however  is never really made anything more than an ideal  This is partly because of her place in the narrative  I don t get a feel for her as much as I do the other characters but she is still delightfully readable and perhaps has the most plot development in her sections so it is forgivable that she is sometimes not as fleshed out  That s also probably because she has the least amount of narration in the novel   I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts   The themes Miss Hawkins touches on during her novel are commonplace for a thriller  trust  love  family  etc  The only theme that really seemed odd was this ever creeping undertone of children being sort of  life ruiners  to the women in this book  Rachel wanted a child  couldn t have one  and thus plummeted into a pit of depression and alcoholism  Anna didn t really want a child  and while she enjoys it more and more as the book goes on  she seems almost content to attribute her having a child to the creation of many of her current problems  Megan never saw herself as a good mother and has deep emotional scars from previous child care experiences  At the end of the day  I don t think any of it was Hawkins saying that children are bad in any sense  The striking negative impacts that all of these children  or a lack thereof  had on their mother s lives was simply something that struck me while reading In summation  I adored every word in Hawkins  novel  The writing was fast paced and exciting  The story felt unique even if I did predict the plot twist about halfway through  there are a few lines that if you really pay attention to you can figure it out even earlier   The characters  despite not being likable  which part of me enjoys   were fleshed out and enthralling to watch even at their most painful times  The dialogue felt real  The structure was magnificent  If there is one book you read in 2015  it should be this one  With a verve for creative storytelling  Hawkins has crafted a unique experience which takes you on a train ride barreling forward at speeds unmatched which are guaranteed to excite and thrill any reader who is a fan of the thriller genre Favorite Quotation    I am interested  for the first time in ages  in something other than my own misery  I have purpose  Or at least  I have a distraction    Wow  If you like a face paced psychological thriller with twists and turns along the way  this one is for you  The lives of three women become inescapably tangled in his dark tale  Yes  maybe two thirds in I knew who the bad guy was    but the way the scenes played out kept me turning pages  This is one of those books that reads like a screen play  I was trying to imagine settings and which American city could be substituted for an American film version   I am tired of every book being compared to Gone Girl  Twisted plots and scheming dialogue existed before Gillian Flynn  Don t get me wrong  I love her work but it isn t the bar for all others to be measured against  Having said that  I LOVED this book  I like books that reveal slowly and keep you guessing and nothing beats that  ah ha  moment when you figure out where they are going and then just hang on for the ride   Yep  this book has managed to keep me up till late on a week night  And yep  I m bobbing my head up and down in agreement with all the 5 star reviews out there  It definitely gets my vote for the best psycho thriller category of books that I ve read so far  Brilliant debut novel  Could barely put it down    Holy  holy crap  The best thriller of the decade   If not for A Little Life  I would have called it the best book of the year  Startling story telling  Bewitching  Amazing  I could pour all the superlatives I know to describe the book and still it wouldn t be enough  Its THAT good  The psychological  hypnotic angle that never worked for me in the Fight club  seamlessly works here  I randomly started reading this book out of a huge collection of books I had because I saw an article about the two books getting confused  The girl on the train and The girl on a train  Apparently  the girl on a train sold a great number of copies because everyone thought that it was this book  I had zero expectations and just wanted to see what all the fuss was about  But when I finished the first page  there was no way I would ve been able to put it down I ve read so many commercial Sidney Sheldon type books known for their master story telling but Paula Hawkins  Train makes them seem like kiddy rides The book also makes some great points  Never judge an alcoholic  Never judge anyone who doesn t comply by the society s standards of being  normal   Etc   The attention to detail whenever she travels in the train is astonishing  The ending was very satisfying  just to see the evil gone  Very few books can take you on a roller coaster ride of emotions in sync with the narration  This is one of them  In almost every page  we think  Oh don t do that Rachel   But still  she has our sympathy  The plot may not be as sophisticated as it may seem  but it doesn t matter in the due course Whatever she writes next  I would blindly buy  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys thrillers  Thank me later  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  It started out a bit slow and then built to an exciting conclusion  Thrilling  Seriously  Fans of Gone Girl have to read this book  Its unsolved mystery  unreliable narrators  and cliffhanger chapters leave readers frustrated  guessing  and longing to know what s real and what isn t  The main character and narrator  Rachel  is an alcoholic whose life is in shambles  Every day  she rides the train from Ashbury to Euston where she takes a particular interest in looking in on the life of a young married couple whose home lies directly next to the railroad tracks  Whenever she sees them out on their back patio  Rachel loves to imagine who they are and fascinates about the perfect life they must have together  However  on the same day the woman from this married couple goes missing  Rachel wakes up with a terrible hangover and the horrible feeling that she witnessed something horrible the night before  This is an amazing thriller and quick read  Jenis buku yang akan membuatmu rela mengorbankan jam tidurmu biar bisa lanjut baca sampe kelar  Harus diakui gaya penceritaannya bikin nggak bisa berenti baca Saya setuju kalau buku ini dibilang perpaduan antara Gone Girl dan Before I Go to Sleep  Sedikit banyak memang mengingatkan pada dua buku tersebut  in a good way  Dari awal sampai pertengahan cerita  saya makin penasaran dengan siapa penjahat sebenarnya  Tapi  pas penulis mulai membocorkan banyak clue yang mengarah ke sana sampai ke endingnya saya agak sedikit kecewa sih  The story turned out to be cheesy  Saya pikir endingnya akan sekeren Gone Girl  __ Saya jadi penasaran dengan versi terjemahannya nanti  Karena kan salah satu daya pikat buku ini adalah  she he her him  yang digunakan oleh penulisnya biar bikin pembaca bingung  Kalau diterjemahkan jadi  dia nya  bakalan rancu nggak ya  Eh iya  selain temanya  yang mirip antara Gone Girl dan buku ini adalah pesan moralnya 1  Kenali pasanganmu baik baik sebelum menikahinya2  Perselingkuhan itu buruk  Tapi akibat yang ditimbulkan bisa jadi lebih buruk 5 bintang saya dedikasikan buat gaya bercerita penulisnya  5 Cranky Stars A friend of mine recommended reading The Girl on the Train and it s been on my TRB list for some time  Last week  I went to Scotland with my husband and I spotted the book on the shelves  Quite often  books with rave reviews leaves me disappointed  but this is not one of them  I finished the book in almost one sitting  if you count the different planes  trains  and automobiles  Rachel takes the train into London every morning  passing the house she used to live in with her ex husband  Tom  He s remarried now to Anna  the woman he cheated on Rachel with  and they have a child  Rachel washes away her grief and pain with alcohol  A few houses down live a couple who fascinate Rachel  She calls them  Jess and Jason   they are the perfect couple  representing everything she has lost until one day  Rachel witnesses something shocking   Jess and Jason  are Scott and Megan Hipwell  Megan is missing and Rachel feels compelled to insert herself in the mystery  offering what she knows to the Police  It fuels an already flammable situation with her ex husband and his new wife The Girl on the Train is a compelling exercise in character study  Told from multiple points of view  each narrator is unreliable  the alcoholic  the liar  and the cheat  They re flawed  lying  faking  and filled with despair in lives that are disappointing  Sometimes  actually  most times  they re unlikable  but fascinating  It pushed all my buttons and I don t think I ve winced or cringed so badly for a fictional character  I found the depiction and analysis of gender  especially women s roles in modern society  insightful  The way in which women scrunch themselves into roles  appropriating society s fantasies  competing with one another  inflicting harm  intentionally or unintentionally   in Disturbia is uncomfortable and thought provoking This is not a perfect book  but its gritty  dark  melancholy  and the central mystery kept me flicking pages until I got to the end  If you like psychological thrillers and books that haven t adopted the pleonastic editing approach i e  removing all the texture of language  I highly recommend it   I loved how the mystery unfolded itself  A page turner  If you liked Gone Girl you ll love this one  too  A young woman goes missing  Is she dead  You think you know who the bad guys and good guys are  but then you re not so sure  The story is told through multiple characters  viewpoints  The suspense is ratcheted to unbearable levels  You have to read the next chapter  then the next The primary narrator of the tale is Rachel  a self deluding alcoholic divorcee  Although she was fired and is now jobless  she continues to ride the train into London every day so her flatmate landlady won t find out  Tom  her ex husband  is now married to Anna  the beautiful blond estate agent who has given him the child Rachel couldn t Rachel fantasizes over a lovely young couple she sees from the train every day  Scott and Bridget  although she has her own fantasy names for them   She wishes her life was perfect like theirs  They live very close to her old house  the same neighborhood as Tom and Anna  Bridget  in fact  used to babysit for Tom and Anna  But then Rachel sees something that shatters her illusions about the young couple  A tall dark stranger kisses Bridget  who then goes missing  Tension builds and builds As we hear from Tom and Anna and all the other characters  we find that all is not as it seems  The story is written with panache and acted superbly by the voice actors  especially the one playing Rachel  I devoured it  It s great to be able to give five stars to a number one best seller  Sometimes they actually deserve it I haven t read any other reviews  but I imagine a few will complain that the ending is too convenient and predictable  It is that  but by that time you will just be so anxious to find out for sure who dunnit  and what happens once it s revealed  that you won t care  At the risk of being a terrible human  there is something uniquely compelling about going down the rabbit hole with a crazy shit show of a character  Kudos to the author for capturing and promoting these characters so beautifully  I m torn between a 4 and a 5 here  but there is definitely a LOT to enjoy in this book   A true page turner  I totally recommend this book      I couldn t put this book down  It s written with narrators that change each chapter so you learn things from different perspectives and come to find why all their lenses are so very different Like  Gone Girl   this is a book I d recommend you NOT read any spoilers about or it ll ruin the reading experience  I was told early on that there was a  big twist  and kept looking for it with each turn of the page  But  be patient Grasshopper   it takes a good damn while  Just relax and enjoy the story as it unfolds Suffice it to say   The Girl on the Train  is the book next in line after  Gone Girl  and  The Husband s Secret  of obsessive reads and breakout bestsellers that soon  everyone  will be talking about  Be the first on your block to read  Girl on the Train  and remain the trendsetter that you are  To compare this book to Gone Girl does this book a disservice   this is miles better  Rachel  the main character in this psychological thriller  is one of the best unreliable narrators I ve read in a long  long time  A woman still damaged from her failed marriage  dependent on alcohol and prone to blackouts  And all of this isn t added to make Rachel interesting  it s all critical to the plot and the devices used as Rachel  the girl on the train  sees something on her commute that should have had no witnesses  And this book is extra impressive given that it s a debut  It s a very interesting book  shows a complex life philosophy and about the things that we are doing to change or improve ourselves I couldn t put this down   Best book I ve read in a while  This is not a book to be missed  The story is narrated by 3 women  a liar  a cheater and an alcoholic  The narrations are flawed and sometimes full of gaps and lies  But that s what makes it so gripping  It s about finding out the truth bit by bit  through small truths and small revelations  Every character seems very deep and realistic  in a pretty horrible way because the raw narration brings out the worst in each character  but yeah    Halfway through reading  I found myself struggling with whether to feel sorry for the woman who  disappeared  or happy that she got what she deserved  But I guess that s how powerful the story was  It makes you understand how each of these characters think  selfish and immoral but also very understandable and relatable  More than anything  I think this story excels at characterization So it s worth the read and worth the good ratings and all that hype  It s a compelling mystery  thrilling  dark and real   Un excelente thriller  que comienza con una historia simple que es contada a 3 voces de un modo ligero que poco a poco te envuelve en una trama dificil de descifrar  Mantenerte a la expectativa ha sido el principal objetivo de Hawkins y cada capitulo es una nueva inquietud  la narrativa como ya lo mencione antes es simple y bastante dinamica pero lo que mas me gusto es que logra hacerte dudar de todos los personajes y las ganas de resolver el misterio  son las que te mantienen al filo de la lectura  El final es el broche de oro por que ademas de estar muy bien estructurado  tambien es bastante inesperado  la duda y los nervios te acompanan las ultimas paginas y tu al igual que la protagonista sufres al descubrir la verdad  ya no quiero decir mas  solo quiero agregar que lo recomiendo ampliamente por que es de los libros que te atrapan haciendote pasar un buen rato  por eso  si eres de los que disfrutas con los temas de desaparicion y el juego de inocente culpable  este libro es para ti   Love to hate the charactersWow  These characters are so real  depressed  and depressing  deceitful and blatantly honest  Rachel  the alcoholic  Tom  her cheating ex husband  Anna  his alarmist new wife  Megan  Tom   Anna s restless neighbor   nanny  and Scott  her jealous husband  Told from Rachel s  Megan s  and Anna s points of view  this suspense will keep you up all night  Rachel is dangerously determined to solve a crime while yo yoing on and off the wagon  Megan s restlessness makes the reader feel like crawling out of her his own skin  Is Rachel a danger to Anna s new family  Anna thinks so  No spoilers here  Many plot twists and full out surprises  this is a must read  Five stars for love to hate characters and ugly reality  A gut wrenching book that is more realistic than we would like to admit   At first I wondered what was so great about this book but then I was blindsided and it became a page turner for me  Anyone that likes a mystery has to read this  The entire time you re reading you want to know the background story behind every character and the true answer to the investigation  I won t say a word  Just read it  This is a perfect read when you are super down  life has been tough  relationships suck    This is how much worse it can get and be thankful This is a book about 5 Losers  Women who are cheaters  bad mothers  drunk  stubborn  self involved  crazy  mentally ill  liars  friendless  LOSERS   Men who are cheaters  bad fathers  stubborn  self involved  crazy  mentally ill  liars friendless  LOSERS    And the children suffer but boy did I like it   This may have been fiction but it was so ridiculous it has to be true  Wow  Just wow  The twist was AMAZING  I highly recommend it  great read  couldn t put it down in some sections but great overall    Five stars alone just for the pure entertainment factor  For a thriller I thought this was excellent and surprisingly well written  Normally I am hesitant about these hyped new releases but I think this one is worth seeking out  Every character was so flawed and downright pathetic with even a tad bit of psychosis thrown in the mix  The author tricked me a few times and of course I never figured out who was the actual killer  Lots of twists and turns  Highly recommended  Found it hard to put this book down  Kept me on my toes right to the end  4 5 stars Read in three days  Loved it  This is the first book I ve read in awhile that I couldn t put down  Loved it  One of the best books I ve read this year  Review to come  Obicno sam zaobilazila trilere  jer sam mislila da mi se nece svideti  Medutim  ova knjiga me je navela da ih stavim u jedne od mojih omiljenih zanrova Dok sam citala nisam mogla naslutiti sta ce se sledece desiti  niti ko je ubica  a to je uvek plus kad citate  Povezivanje tri lika i pogled na celu stvar iz njihove perspektive je veoma dobro uraden  Niti je previse jednostavno  niti komplikovano  Savrsen spoj za lako i zabavno citanje Ima te li neki prdlog  Sta sledece da citam   After Blood of My Blood by Barry Lyga  I was in the mood for psychological thriller so I picked this up This book satisfied my need and more  I love how it has a re reading value  I love how it forced me to read slowly  to pay attention to where the chapter fits in the timeline  to take a break so I can think and speculate  I love how even though I predicted the culprit early in the book  there were so many distractions that threw me off and made me doubt my theory Just a word of caution   if you think you would really  really have problems with morally corrupted characters then maybe you would hate this book  Great novel  Although I enjoyed it and am giving it five stars  I don t think it s an epic thriller  I ve read books over the years that I enjoyed just as much as this one It was intriguing and I was anxious to see  who done it   I loved this  Total binge read  I started it  and read every free second until I finished it  Not usually into psychological thrillers  but this was great  I bought this book because I d seen it in the window of Waterstones for weeks  I didn t quite know what to expect  because the blurb is quite vague  I was more than pleasantly surprised  This book was incredible  In the beginning I assumed it was just a Chick Lit book by the writing style but as things kicked off it seemed to change  I will now and forever recommend this book to people  I absolutely loved this book See full review here   http   livinginthekitchenwithpuppies     5 brilliant stars   This has been in all honesty one of the best books i ve ever read  Gripping  terrifying an so intriguing  The characters were just stunningly created and the action never faltered  I thought it will be just an over advertised book when i picked it up yesterday  but oh boy  was i in for a surprise  This book will hunt me for a while  Brilliant writing style   A master class in plotting  Layer by layer  as we work through the issues of each of three incredibly unreliable narrators  the story comes out slowly and with maximum suspense  I listened to this audiobook in a very meta way  as it was mostly while riding the train to work  I don t see anything terribly interesting  though  unfortunately  The Audible audiobook had three different readers and they were all excellent  It was very well put together and kept me on the edge of my seat  RemarkableI am a young adult who is very much just into to reading the average young adult romance  This book  however  took me away from my norm and was surprisingly much more engaging than my usual  This book takes you from suspense to heartbreak to confusion in seconds and you almost feel that you are the character experiencing these events  I would recommend this to anyone who loves a mystery with a different flare but I would also recommend this to young adults like me who are looking for an incredible book that may not be what you re used to but that is worth straying from that norm to read   All right  I loved it  Snagged me early on  wouldn t let me go  I was fascinated how Rachel s character developed  The entire thing knocked me for a loop  The story is so precise and everything little detail is so important to the plot that you just want to keep reading  The outcome is insane and I would have never guessed it  I recommend   I m not sure why so many people are hating on this book  especially if you complained about how depressing and how sloppy the characters where  Obviously it s going to depressing considering the fact that it is a thriller solely based on murder  lechery and unfaithfulness  I don t really see any room for happiness in this book and it would have been ridiculously cheesy if it was a picture perfect ending wouldn t it   I thought this book was being over hyped like many others I ve read so I wasn t expecting it to be as great as it was  It starts off a little slow but picks up speed after about 50 pages  I had my theories along the way  but it kept me guessing up up until we find out about Megan s second baby  At that point I knew it was Tom  People claimed to have known right away  but I didn t put it together quite as quickly  So many people say they are all unlikable characters and I simply have to disagree  I liked Rachel  her realness  her vulnerability and her rawness  I felt bad for Rachel  yes she was weak and absolutely pathetic at times  but she didn t warrant any disdain on my part  She fell on hard times  had an abusive and manipulative husband who became her ex husband due to his infidelity which he blamed on her  she desperately wanted a child and was unable to have children  and she didn t seem to have a very good relationship with her parents  People go through things that change them  cause them to make some bad decisions and things happen  I cringed at things she did and said  but to me  she was a likable character  A hot mess   but likable One part that left me scratching my head was the significance of the clothes she sees in the first page of the book and the clothes later towards the end of the book by the tracks The tipsy red head from the train was a great  red herring   I focused on him a lot in the beginning and thought he had a huge part in whatever happened during the  black dread  of Saturday night 5 5 stars from me   Holy molyThis book is so good  It swoops you right in from the beginning  The characters are well rounded and easy to become engrossed in their individual stories  The story itself is a tornado of what the heck  I would recommend to anyone who likes to feel like Dorothy from wizard of oz while she s spinning and is in between oz and Kansas   It has been 4 months since I ve read this and I realized I never wrote a review  What is there to say that someone hasn t already  The characters are all awful in the best way  I almost moved on to a different book about 15  in or so  took a break for a couple days I think  but I pushed through  I told myself that something had to be worth it in the end and I was right  I don t look ahead  I don t try to guess who the perpetrators are in any story  Or maybe I just suck at doing that anyways  However  it definitely helps keep the mystery there if I m not trying to figure it out before the end I am almost too good at putting myself in someone else s shoes  I could see where everyone was coming from and why shitty decisions were sometimes made  Alcoholic Rachel was so distressing in my head  The vulnerability of all relationships and marriages was just completely head on and frightening  I was an emotional wreck for a while there 5 damn stars from me  I loved it  I couldn t stop reading it  I missed a couple events because I couldn t put my kindle down  I read it in all my down time  I m hesitant to read more like it because I felt so many different emotions from this story  I think this is my longest review  Wow    What an exciting  suspenseful thriller      The lives of 3 women tragically and inexplicably linked but not fully revealed til the end  I raced through this book in 4 days  WOWZA     This book caught my attention because 1  its currently on the top charts  2 the reviews suggested that it was along the lines of the twisted genre like Gone Girl which I absolutely love  I ended up buying this book for my kindle and was able to fly through it  I loved the storyline which kept me interested the entire way  I felt like I was being manipulated by these characters  When everything begins to wrap up towards the end  I cannot believe how brilliant this author is  I would love to see this story as a movie  I highly recommend it  This book was difficult to read because the lead character was such a train wreck  pardon the pun   I think we all see a little of ourselves in her  or was it just me    It had a little of a Gone Girl feel to it  but it definitely had its own story  I like Ms  Hawkins character development  and the story from the perspective of each of its characters is something I ve admired in other writers  Barbara Kingsolver comes to mind  for one   This was a mystery that had me riveted  and I didn t start to suspect who the culprit was until very close to the end  All in all  a definite page turner   Rachel is enmired in depression after her inability to conceive a child  She turned to drink  and her alcoholism has now cost her her marriage  her job  her friends  She takes the train into London every morning and returns every evening in an attempt to hide her joblessness from the university friend who took her in two years earlier An improbable protagonist  from the sound of it  And yet I found Rachel compelling and palpably real  a character who drew me in and kept me reading to the end  Rachel is obsessed by the disappearance of Megan  who lives on the same street where Rachel once lived with her ex husband  Convinced she s seen something that could help solve the mystery  she contacts Megan s husband and inserts herself into the investigation  It does not go well  Rachel lies repeatedly to her ex husband  his new wife  who suspects Rachel of wanting to harm her child   and Megan s husband  not to mention the police investigating the case  She exaggerates her link to Megan  tries to hide her secrets  goes on the wagon and falls off again  and yet keeps pursuing the case because she fears that she is somehow connected to Megan s disappearance but recalls little after being in a drunken stupor that night This is not a fast paced thriller or edge of your seat suspense novel  but it is rich and  to me  captivating  The story unfolds from the first person points of view of three characters  Rachel  primarily   but also Megan and Anna  the woman now married to Rachel s ex husband  A twist at the end may remind you of Hitchcock or James Cain  Well done Five stars for depth of character development  intriguing storyline  and skillful writing  I feel that what happens when a novel gets popular is that other books like it kind of ride its fame  This was the case with Girl On A Train  The novel in question is Gone Girl  These two books are very similar and I think it s pretty obvious the publisher just wanted to replicate its success  Here s the catch  Girl On A Train is much better than Gone Girl First how are they similar  The narration is told through different characters perspective  A girl goes missing and the question is who done it How are they different  Girl On A Train has like able characters a who you actually root for  There is redemption not just depression  Also the main narrator isn t a bitch  she s psycho stalker alcoholic  Lastly  there is literary quality to this book it s not just a pop novel  There are metaphorical motifs  coming of age and well written mystery all over the place  What does the train represent for instance  What is the source of Rachel s alcoholism  What did she forget the night Megan went missing  This book was a real page turner  I know they got a movie in the works for it with Emily blunt  But I suggest you read it before the movie  It really is an Alfred Hitchcock type tale  I loved this book  It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time  I recommend this to everyone   Tot het einde spannend  en hoe alles als puzzelstukjes in elkaar viel   Het hield je in de ban This book has been compared to the movie Rear Window  and it s a good comparison  It has the same feeling of impending danger  of dread  It has twists and turns that keep the reader guessing  The girl  Rachel  rides the train to and and from London each workday  As she rides  she looks out the window at the houses she passes and imagines the lives the people lead  One couple particularly stands out to her  she gives them names and creates an imaginary life for them  idealizing them as the perfect couple  When she learns that the wife  Megan  has disappeared  she tries to find out what happened  but her alcoholism hinders her  In her quest for the truth  she becomes involved in the lives of narcissistic people  any of whom may have something to do with Megan s disappearance  If you like Hitchcock  this is the book for you  I went in to this book expecting not to like it  so I was very surprised when I LOVED this book  It s touted as  the new Gone Girl  as all new female driven thrillers are these days  However  this book is not Gone Girl   it s so much better  The writing is infinitesimally better   The story is more intense  The main characters are this fantastic mix of likable and sympathetic while also being repugnant and cringe worthingly pathetic  This book is totally worth all the hype   Every day on her way into London on the train  Rachel watches the beautiful couple in the house  It s just down the road from where she used to live   and where her now ex husband lives with his new wife and daughter  If Tom hadn t left her  these people would have been Rachel s neighbors  possibly even her friends  As Rachel watches them from the train window  most days she s also got a couple of canned gin and tonics  or some of those little bottles of wine to keep her company  Part of the reason her marriage failed was Rachel s excessive drinking  And she hasn t been able to stop since  Then one day she seems something that changes everything   the woman is in her backyard as usual   but she s kissing another man  And the next day she s gone missing  Rachel could be the only one who knows about her secret lover  Should she go to the police  And even if she does  will they believe such an unreliable witness  Great thriller that reviewers are comparing to GONE GIRL  This was a fantastic book  a pleasure to read  Even though I predicted the twist  the characters were so realistic  the pacing so well done  and the story so intriguing that I almost couldn t put it down  The book starts off relatively innocuously  a woman  people watching  creates a story for two strangers lives that is basically her hope for herself  But the author takes that and makes an amazing story out of it with murder  conspiracy  intrigue  and another case of an unreliable narrator trying to figure out exactly what she saw  4 5 5 J ai vraiment beaucoup aime cette lecture Au debut j ai ete un peu derangee par la redondance de l addiction du perso principale  mais finalement on s y habitue et c est ce qui fait son caractere apres tout J ai aime la tension constante qui augmente de plus en plus vers la fin et le denouement Tres bonne lecture  qu on pourrait comparer a Gone Girl  j ai quand meme prefere Gone Girl   Je recommande vivement ce thriller   Seriously  read this book  I started feeling panicky as it was nearing the end as I didn t want it to finish  Thrilling on every page  For readers who like to go deep into characters  inner workings  Hawkins creates compelling suspense  plants small clues that add up to big stories  and creates totally believable characters who hide their flaws from themselves while they reveal them to readers  In this book  character IS plot  enhanced by the use of 3 first person narrators  Very well written  a page turner of the best kind  Mind blown 1  Megan    that sucks girl  Probably shouldn t have dealt with your issue with human contact    probably should have continued therapy properly  But it all sucks 2  Anna  Really you witch  You re the biggest witch I ve ever read about 3  Rachel   You poor poor  Nell   You re the biggest  Nell  narrator I ve had in a long time  It was great to be in your company but boy it was hard to figure it out with such an unreliable narrator This was by far better than what  The Husband s Secret  tried to do about secrets in a marriage and family  and this was also so much more rewarding than  Gone Girl   and I love that book   I had this book recommended by a couple of my Goodread friends and was looking forward to reading it and how glad I am for the excellent recommendation  This debut novel gripped me from the start and I found it very difficult to put down  I can understand the comparisons to  Gone Girl  but this book deserves it s own praise  excellently written with strong characters and a superbly paced story  There are twists and turns and the building of tension and anticipation is first rate  I can really imagine this been made into a film  I look forward to more from this author  I loved Girl On A Train  I flew through this book in no time  I felt like I was peeking into the diary of an obsessive  neurotic  alcoholic and I could not look away  One for Sorrow  Two for joy  Three For A Girl     Reading response 6This book was very thrilling and an exciting page turner  There are three main characters that each take turns telling the story  The most interesting part is that they all are flawed in different ways and the reader is left questioning if any can be trusted  The content of this book explores the desire to want what you don t or can t have and the fascination with other peoples lives seeming perfect on the outside  When the characters delve deeper into each others lives they soon realize that everyone has a little secret that is not noticeable at first glance  I would definitely recommend this book to an older audience  This book would be a good recommendation to a high school student who is bored easily and often time has difficulty finishing a book  The various unreliable narrators coupled with an enthralling mystery is fast paced and keeps the reader interested  The mystery gives the reader a purpose to complete the book and figure out who done it    My favorite part of the book was the deep character development of each of the flawed narrators  It s easy to forget that not everyone is as perfect as they seem at first glance  The deeper you go  the darker it gets    First of all  make sure you ve got the right  Girl on the Train  book  I don t even know if I read the one I was supposed to read  Did I intend to read  Girl on a Train  by AJ Waines   Oh well  this one gets more stars  I didn t like Gone Girl  but I saw a lot of similarities  most notable  WACKO characters  and I really enjoyed this book  It s a fast moving crime murder mystery fiction with lots of suspense and twists and a main character that you don t know if you like or hate  She sure is a HOT MESS Anyway  I couldn t put this book down  A fast  fun read  Two thoughts  1  All three female main characters in this book  there are 3  are seriously screwed up  So are all the men  Makes it hard to relate to ANYONE in the book  What the heck      On the other hand  who cares 2  Be careful that you note who is narrating each chapter before you dive in  On my kindle  the titles  Megan    Rachel  and  Anna  were very pale and it took me a couple chapters before I realized that it kept switching perspective   I was like   Wait a minute  I thought she was divorced from Tom      and I had to go back  Enjoy the ride  This is quite simply one of the most interesting and brilliant books I have ever read   I was completely engrossed and I really couldn t put it down until the end   A good story that leads us down a path of expectations   slowly building tension until an unexpected plot twist catches us off guard   All the elements are here   suspense   the intrigue of sex  violence  betrayal  secrets   manipulation   murder     There were some times when I became very tired and annoyed by Rachel s alcohol addiction   but maybe that was what made the whole things look more interesting   I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good suspense thriller    3    Super creative plot  I loved the main character and how this book kept you thinking of everyone as a suspect  I didn t want to stop reading it  It is comparable to  Gone Girl  but so much better  I really give the author credit for having written this after  Gone Girl  and to pull it off like she did  I liked this book so much better mostly because I actually liked the main character  Plus this book had more characters and I enjoyed getting to know more about them throughout the book  Yeah I thought everyone was the killer at one time but that made it so fun  Then when I realized it wasn t who I thought it was then I thought well who could it be then  Such a great plot twist that kept me thinking to the end  I would love to read books like this everyday  Holy  insert swear word here   What a ride  That was one of the most awfully awesome books I have ever read  I didn t like one single character but I could not stop until I found out the twist  I wouldn t recommend this book to anyone that gets offended with language  which I do but like a train wreck I couldn t put it down   I can t give it anything less than 5 stars it wouldn t be honest of my experience while in this twisted  hot mess of a novel  Can t wait for the author to write another one  Well done Paula Hawkins  well done  Rachel is an overweight  divorced alcoholic with no real life of her own  Because of this  she s begun doing some people watching while on the train on her way to and from work  Her people watching is a bit different  though   she s watching two specific people  and she s built an entire life for them in her own head  They have a sweet  wonderful life  according to her fantasy  but soon she learns that the reality might be far different  As she tries to sort out the truth from lies for both her fantasy couple and her own past  we have to try to figure out if we can trust Rachel or not  This book started off a bit slow for me  I didn t feel bored  exactly  but it felt like the book wasn t what I expected  It didn t take long for things to change  though  and that was when I realized the beginning was intentional  It jars to reader  to go from what seems like a nice little life into something far different  Rachel  as a narrator  is very unreliable  It doesn t take long to realize that not only can we not trust what she says  but that even she doesn t trust what she says  Megan and Anna are not really any more reliable  though  Everyone has their own secrets  and none of them is willing to share all those secrets with us  the reader  I also found that I didn t really like any of the characters  There was no one in this book that I really liked  Normally  I would say this was a bad thing in a book  If I don t like at least one character  I feel like the book is a loss  But in this book  not liking anyone actually worked in its favor  I didn t like anyone  so I was willing to believe that anyone was capable of anything  I also didn t feel much sympathy for anyone  There were a few small moments here and there where Rachel  Megan or Anna elicited a tiny amount of sympathy  but it was usually very fleeting  I was kept guessing pretty much right up to the very end  As things began to unravel  I began to put the pieces together  but right up until the book actually confirmed my guesses  I wasn t sure if I was right or not  I really enjoyed that aspect  Sometimes I figure out who did it or why they did it very early in books  and I feel a bit let down  This book made sure that I was on my toes  trying to figure it all out  until the end  and that was a satisfying conclusion for me   I LOVED this book  Can t wait for the movie  I hope they do it up right  Could not put this down  there are so many twists and turns   love how it was written I brought this on kindle on a whim  Not my usual choice of book but wow  From page one I couldn t put it down  Very well written and very believable characters  Full of twists and turn and a surprising ending  I never wanted it to finish  Really hoping this author brings out another book soon  This story gave me a lot of sleepless nights and was really addictive  Would recommend to anyone   Best book I ve read in a long time   So good I couldn t put it down  Now I m tired  And I have a baby  Stupid book  GREAT book    I read this in one day  I couldn t put it down    I wasn t sure I would like this book  But others told me I had to read it  and I m really glad I did  I couldn t put it down  I just had to know what was going to happen next   Very gripping  suspenseful  and intense  not to mention the great group of crazy characters she created  This was a well described  well writing story that never slowed down  and the list goes on  A must read of you enjoy a good thriller   As addictive and fast paced as Gone Girl  but with a  somewhat  more sympathetic protagonist  Hypnotic prose and a satisfying ending  Definitely an author to watch  I loved it   This one keeps your interest and keeps you guessing till the very end  Well done  This audiobook was captivating  Three women read the parts of Rachel  Megan   Anna giving it added personality  It is more of a mystery than a psychological thriller  I gasped at least a dozen times  frightening all in the vicinity   I am a sucker for a good mystery thriller book where a person goes missing out of the blue  These are the kind of books that make me go   that was a good book  The Girl on the Train was exactly like that  I couldn t figure out who was to blame and that made me love the book even more   I ll never look at people on a train the same  Rachel is an unemployed  divorced alcoholic living with an old school mate who doesn t know that Rachel is unemployed  Too embarrassed to tell her flat mate that she lost her job for cussing out a client during a drunken lunch  she gets up every morning  and takes the train to London  then back every evening  The train s route takes her by the home she used to live in with her ex husband  where he now resides with his former lover  now his wife  and daughter in that same house  amidst all of Rachel s old belongings   A few doors down from her old home lives a young hetero couple  and Rachel makes up stories about what she views as this couple s wonderful life  Then  one day  it all goes wrong Told from the point of view of three women  the story is very good  and I enjoyed it very much  The last forty pages had me hooked  it just took me awhile to get there  I found myself putting it down because I began to tire of the foolish situations Rachel s drunkenness would get her into  although  if I was going to be fair  these incidences help to build up  and explain  what occurs at the end  At least one critic described this book as      this year s  Gone Girl   I disagree  The book is well written  but many of the characters are shallowly drawn  and let s face it   the twists in  Gone Girl  were jaw dropping  This  not so much  Good read  but not five stars  TL DR   Very thrilling  dark  exciting and frustrating This probably is the most frustrating book I ve read so far and yet I couldn t stop reading it until the end  I somehow managed to reached the last few page and only then  could make a long sigh  Right from the start  the characters are sick  depressing and failing at their lives I don t like it and I told myself to stop reading it several times along the way yet I did read it a day ironically The storyline is really good  fast paced  moving back and forth between dates and related characters Lastly  if you enjoyed  Gone Girl   I guess you might enjoy this one as well  I ve read more than my share of mysteries  thrillers  and suspense novel  Incredibly good  bad and really  really stupid  My favorite television genre are mysteries  particularly British ones with Detective Inspectors and proper cups of tea every time you turn around  But this  this jewel  is probably the best one I ve read in a long time  Being so accustomed to the genre  I m not usually flummoxed about where the story is going and  who did it   so to speak  However  it wasn t until the phone was found with only 50 pages left that the pieces began to fall into place  Even then  I still couldn t get my head around it  I had to keep going back and re reading passages  It wasn t until literally the last page when I captured the full picture of both  As you can see  I read this in the space of 24 hours  I don t like cliches  but I was riveted  Well played  Ms  Hawkins  well played   Let me just say  this book isn t what you expect  It s been compared to Hitchcock and in premise  I d agree  Like Gone Girl  however  this book delves deep into unlikeable characters and makes you somehow like them despite their many  many  flaws  People said this one started off  slow   but I don t think so  If you re expecting a thrill a minute mystery  though  you might be disappointed  If you re just ready to settle in and enjoy the ride  I highly recommend this one  Catch it before they cast the movie  It s always more fun when you aren t picturing Hollywood faces on the characters  I ve found  I really enjoyed this book  It kept me guessing all the way through  Although none of the characters were very likeable they were real and I lurched from being angry  sympathetic  impatient  understanding and confused by them  I was left glad that Rachel seemed to be sorting herself out  I did feel it needed at least one good man in it however  other than the policeman  I found Rachel s journey to self awareness very interesting  I too like to look into gardens and houses from the train and it made me wonder what I would do if I though I had seem something unusual  Recommend this to those who like a multi thread thriller   This book held me captive for close to 3 days  I wanted to drink it all in  to solve the mystery but I also didn t want it to end  Was anyone reliable  Such wonderful writing  so many dark sides  Loved it    Finally a book that lived up to the hype it s getting    Totally has the Gone Girl vibe  I loved the way this was written  the mystery and the tension that goes back and forth really had me tuned in and ears perked   Give this a try even if you didn t like Gone girl  it s not as psycho and dark   just slightly crazy   Che posso dire su questo libro    Non mi e piaciuto e non nel senso che e scritto male o cose di questo genere  ma e una storia veramente realistica dove le sofferenze delle persone sono fatti reali che possono succedere ad ognuno di noi ed e questo che non piace  che mi fa stare male dopo aver interrotto la lettura o dopo averlo finito  Sono dell opinione che un libro debba farti sognare  uscire fuori dalla realta e per un momento non presentarti i problemi reali della vita  Mi ero fatta un idea sbagliata di questo libro e mi sono ritrovata con un agitazione mai provata prima  Il mio voto obiettivo e 5 perche e scritto molto bene  entri precipitosamente nella storia e non riesci a staccarti dalla lettura perche vuoi sapere di piu  ma da un punto di vista emotivo  soggettivo e psicologico non mi e piaciuto  Non vorrei piu leggere qualcosa di simile   Couldn t put it down  I haven t read a book in two days in ages  Page turner  sooo good        A tiding of magpies  One for sorrow  two for joy  three for a girl  four for a boy  five for silver  six for gold  seven for a secret never to be told Such a mind blowing   Each scene gave me chills in the pit of my stomach  It was at some extent a psychological thriller too  The story was quite awesome There was so much suspence in every scene   the set up was all great I was so hooked up till the end I think it could have a still better ending   but although I can t rate it less than 5 it was a hell lot interesting The Flow with all the characters was fascinating   Rachel is the main character in the novel  she is hiding a few secrets which are revealed as you read on  she is annoying  but there were times I felt sorry for her  a bit of a like and dislike character  As she travels daily on the train to work  she creates her own little world  loads of people can relate to this  the same journey  the same faces  etc and when she sees something from the window one day and feels she need to go to the police  and report it  but she doesn t leave it at that  she gets involved  she can t leave things be  This leads Rachel into some difficulties  The story starts slow  with the tension building as you read on  Alongside Rachel there are there are two narrators in the book  Anne and Megan  I didn t particularly enjoy these other character either  but don t let that put you off  this is part of the novel  at least I thought so  You need to pay attention to the chapter headings  they have dates and this is important overall  This is a very clever book  well written  flows nicely  with twists and turns I didn t expect  One of the best debut novels I have read this year  a definite read for those who love psychological thrillers and cannot put down books  for more information click to view my blog  http   readinginecuador wordpress com    Loved it  Well written  well plotted and with a main character that continues to haunt you after the final page  I highly recommend this book  J ai vraiment beaucoup apprecie cette lecture     un thriller comme je les aime meme si a vrai dire  ma note serait plutot de 4 5 5 que 5 5  faudrait vraiment pouvoir attribuer des 1 2 etoiles sur Goodreads    J ai vraiment aime le cote  anti heros  des personnages  On est tres loin des personnages de fiction parfaits ou irreprochables et moi  ca m a vachement plu   This was a quick day and a half read for me  I only wish it d been longer  Such an interesting idea for a novel  I loved it  I love people watching and often find myself wondering things like Rachel did  Grew to love Rachel very quickly and really enjoyed reading from her point of view  I enjoyed too though  the glimpse into Anna and Megan s heads  Over all  a wonderful and thrilling read  So suspenseful and so hard to put down the further you get  well i finish it in 2 days and i shake all the finale it was amazin epic an totally unspected  people pleas read this is a master piece    If you re sensitive to foul language  I suggest you stop reading RIGHT NOW Because seriously  what in the actual fuck did I just read My mind is blown  Like    I don t understand  Maybe it s because the time is 4 AM and I ve been reading it since midnight  I feel like I can t think straight I m at a dilemma  I don t know whether or not to give this book one star for being so fucked up  or if it deserves five stars because it was written SO DAMN FRIGGEN AMAZINGLY GOOD     For now  because it s 4 AM  I m settling for five stars because in NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM DID I SEE THAT ENDING COMING    Annnddd I m not finishing this review right now  I m tired  and this novel fried my brain  Bye  A pretty terrific psychological thriller  Convincing characters  tight editing  believable conclusion  I gobbled it   Depressing characters but I couldn t put it down  Full of suspense and intrigue  Makes me realize how nice it is to have a boring life   This book really lived up to the hype  I loved reading the multiple point of views of the three women  Each perspective was unique  distinct and engaging  I loved reading Rachel s perspective the most  mostly because it sounded so genuine and in pain  Hawkins really captured the loneliness of Rachel  and it made me sympathize with her  Her perspective was also the least reliable  Here  is where I saw inklings of Gone Girl  which is a fair comparison  As a reader  I connected with Megan the most  probably because she was the youngest of the three women  Her worries  and struggles were more relevant to someone who is in their early and mid twenties  I enjoyed reading her troubled perspective  but I did not feel her pain and sorrow as much as I felt Rachel s Anna was the one I felt the least connected to  Her perspective was the shortest and I am glad  She is awful  and I had a hard time seeing things in her perspective  Many times  I tried to put myself in her shoes  but failed  I could not understand the choices she made  Despite the fact I disliked her as a person  her character added a needed variety to the book  I am glad the readers are able to read her voice and experience her pain I am pumped for the movie to come out this year  with Emily Blunt as Rachel   O I m still mesmerized by her in Edge of Tomorrow   fangirling  Great book had me gripped from the start and the ending didn t disappoint   I know it took me more than a week to finish this  That s because I went to London for the holidays and didn t read a lot  Anyways  WOW  5 starts   AMAZING book   AMAZING ending   was NOT seeing that coming   Ahh so excited for the movie   I read this book in two days  I thought it was a great mystery   I love books that keep you guessing and wanting to read  This book did both  Enjoyed it and wanting to keep ready every time I picked it up   Bohaterka  Dziewczyny z pociagu  nie jest osoba ktora wzbudza sympatie  wrecz przeciwnie juz od samego poczatku drazni  meczy  a potem wzbudza litosc  Tym bardziej autorka wykonala kawal dobrej roboty  bo mimo tych odczuc mialem ochote dalej sledzic jej historie i w miare jak ukladanka nabierala ksztaltow tym samym zmienialy sie moje uczucia do Rachel i z napieciem czekalem na dalszy rozwoj wydarzen   Dziewczyna z pociagu  miala rozne opinie  jedni sie nia zachwycali  a innym nie przypadla kompletnie do gustu  Tak skrajne oceny najczesciej charakteryzuja jednak ksiazki dobre  no a o gustach   no coz   ponoc sie nie dyskutuje  Ja naleze do tych ktorzy odbieraja ksiazke ksiazke popelniona przez Paule Hawkins bardzo pozytywnie  Odpowiadala mi wolno snujaca sie akcja  co budowalo powoli napiecie  Bardzo dobrze skonstruowane sa tez postacie glownych bohaterow pod katem psychologicznym  o czym za duzo pisac nie bede bo nie chce zbytnio zdradzac tresci  Przede wszystkim ksiazka ta pokazuje jak mylace moga byc pozory i dlaczego warto sobie zadac trud poznania historii czlowieka  Doskonaly thriller   Wow  This book is amazing  A must read  it will leave you with your mouth wide open   Awesome read  Couldn t put it down  This was a good gritty mystery  It s realism  focus on human frailties and believable voice made it a fun read  I rarely read mystery thrillers  This one intrigued me from reviews I read and am glad I selected it  The fifth star is for the great portrayal of alcoholism  selfishness and pride  Blew me away  Loved it  Full of mystery and suspense  I usually figure out where most plots are headed  but I did not with this one  It kept me on the edge  If you re looking for a feel good read  this isn t it  Much of it is pretty depressing actually  but so damn interesting  And full of flawed characters  No one is the ideal good in this novel  Excellent storytelling  I will be looking for more from this author  This book is great  you believe that everything is as you see it  for example a gent is wearing a suit so he must be off to work     or is he   This story makes you think that everyone has a back story which you don t know anything about  In this case there are many back stories in which you couldn t guess just by looking at someone Someone is having a drink on the train  what does that mean to you  In this book  Rachel has a drinking problem  She goes on the train every day to London and it stops at a signal which allows her to look over a row of houses and creates situations for a couple who live there  Jason and Jess  only they aren t Jason and Jess Secrets unfold  slowly  but once they do  there is no going back There are lots of twists and turns  peoples backgrounds unfold  The truth comes out  There s a chronicle liar  deception  adulterers  murder  to name a few This book shows a few women s point of views  I liked this  it was good to see how everyone matched up  How people view one another  I also liked that the writing changed for each person This book lives up to the hype and most certainly up to those of its predecessors such as Gone Girl  However  this is more of a real life believable situation I think this book will get a lot of press in 2015 and it will be for all the right reasons  It is addictive  You won t be able to put it down  I have already been telling people about it  A must read of 2015  a book to sink your teeth into It s very realistic  it allows you to see that enemies can become friends  People have lives and addictions that you know nothing about Nothing is ever as it seems      Yes  I really do think it s as good as Gone Girl  It may not toy with you quite as much  my impression of the main character didn t change dramatically over the course of the book  which it definitely did with Amazing Amy   but the main character is complex and flawed and very real  I loved the way the mystery slowly unfolded and the conclusion was suitably dramatic and satisfying   I read this book for one of my March book club read and I have to say I was very surprised and intrigued with it  There are so many things to say about this book  I got so fed up and irradiated with the main character to then turn around and feel so bad for her  There are many twists and turn you think you have things figured out and then it all changes again  It was hard to put down so that made it for a quick read  I loved the writing style of this coming from the view of several people in the book and can t wait to read more form this author  Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning  Every day she rattles down the track  flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes  and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck  She s even started to feel like she knows them   Jess and Jason   she calls them  Their life  as she sees it  is perfect  Not unlike the life she recently lost And then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough  Now everything s changed  Unable to keep it to herself  Rachel offers what she knows to the police  and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next  as well as in the lives of everyone involved  Has she done more harm than good  Fantastically written riveting whodunit  Kept me guessing right up to the reveal and my heart firmly in my mouth throughout  5    4 5 stars The Girl on the Train wasn t something I was expecting to read  One of my friends was reading it for his book club and handed it to me last night  I wouldn t say it s a  short read   but I did finish it very quickly because I wanted to know if I was right In the end  I was  But I don t think too many people will have guessed it from the start  My own unique experiences led me to see through the lies  I ll detail more below SPOILERS             As a victim of an abuser and narcissist  I almost immediately knew Tom s game  I was happy that the author didn t go all Gillian Flynn and paint the women as the bad guys  The Girl on the Train was much more true to life in that way  and it was absolutely chilling The first few  chapters  were fairly boring  but once I realized what was happening  it was a difficult book to put down  My only real criticism  besides the fact that some of the sections needed tightening up  is that it seems like every major female character in the book is in someway always speaking about either men or babies  And when they re speaking to each other  it s always cruel or catty  There doesn t seem to be any solidarity between women at all in this book  which is a shame  especially since at the end Anna had the opportunity to redeem herself Anna  in my opinion  is just as bad as her murderous husband  Tom  While Anna doesn t actually  physically harm anyone  well      she conspires to ruin lives  and when Rachel is going to be killed  she decides to sit and share a beer with him over her unconscious body  She s only upset at Tom for lumping her in with  fat  ugly Rachel  during one of his monologues  which I also thought were a little too villainous  more cartoonish than real   and the only thing that changes her mind  she is originally okay with Tom killing Rachel  is that she worries about their baby getting hurt  She is just as much of a dangerous psychopath as Tom is  and unfortunately  we don t get any justice for all that Anna has done  though Tom suffers spectacularly  I m definitely keen on reading more from this author  especially in the mystery thriller genre  I thought The Girl on the Train was very well composed and I was entertained  mostly  throughout   Very good book  I figured it out before it was over  but not until I was getting close to the end  Loved how it was written by all three women too  5 5Benden tam notu alan ilk kitap  Gercekten de hak etti  Yorumu icin http   kronikokur blogspot com tr 201    Omg  pues aun estoy en shock con este libro  Lo primero es que desde que inicias te invade una sensacion de intriga con respecto a los personajes  desde el principio te vas creando ideas muchas erroneas y otras totalmente correctas eso me paso con uno de los personajes  su bajo perfil me alerto a bueno  SIN SPOILER  jajajja  El libro es fantastico  ame la narrativa ya no que solo lo narra un personaje si no varios los personajes en si me encantaron aunque por momentos queria matar Rachel que es nuestro personaje principal  aun asi no pude evitar encarinarme con ella  si no han leido este libro que esperan  La Chica del tren es un viaje con bastantes baches pero del cual no vas a querer bajar    Recomendado    Another book to add to the couple murder mystery genre   think Gone Girl  What Came Before  The Silent Wife  A rollicking read oddly akin to an episode of Midsomer Murders   everyone seemed guilty at one point  I didn t see the ending until the author revealed it  And I enjoyed reading from the point of view of a distrusted character whose life is messy  This is the first book in a long while that has actually given me a  book hangover   It was my life for the past two days  it completely sucked me in  None of the characters are appealing  but their development through the book is part of what makes so interesting  And while I may not particularly like Rachel  there are certainly aspects of her character I am sympathetic to and with which I can  however remotely  relate to  She s lonely and therefore imagines an idyllic life for a couple she can see from the train every morning  When she finds out the real story  however  that s when it gets really interesting Especially considering this is Paula Hawkins  first novel  it is incredibly well written  Both plot and character development move at just the right pace to create suspense while keeping you interested and entertained  Super awesome book  Kept me hooked till the end  I pretty much loved this book  I couldn t put it down  It had me guessing throughout the whole thing  I thought it was this guy at one point and then maybe this girl and then maybe this other guy  Page turner for sure  It does make you realize that things are always what they seem   Brilliant   Crikey  Couldn t put it down  Lots of twists and turns  A life of being teetotal could be coming my way  What an amazing thrill of a book  I love Hitchcock and totally could see why it was described as similar  At first the editor in me was going to hate the sentence structure and character tenses  but when I fixated more into the rhythm  I understood it and that all melted away  The pacing was spot on  I loved that it was written in British English  I loved her foreshadowing and her gothic and creepy elements  I liked her characterization  I enjoyed trying to figure Rachel out and felt sad for her  even when other people were not cutting her a break  I enjoyed how she played with the idea that people aren t always what they seem and to not judge a book by it s cover  all those norms  but done in a way that propelled me through the pages  The topics reached into my gut and made me feel on a depth that put knots into my stomach  Themes of motherhood  abortion  barrenness  male female relationships  abuse  addiction  etc  all were explored in a captivating and mesmerizing way  This book will linger with me   Thank God for CBeebies  By the time I was two thirds of the way through this excellent thriller  I had to put the children in front of the television so I could race through the final chapters  Utterly engrossing  an easy read and a really well paced psychological thriller  Paula Hawkins also has the enviable gift of making her central character sympathetic even though Rachel is a self pitying  lying drunk  Highly recommended  The Girl on the Train begins with Rachel on a commuting train to London  She enjoys looking into the trackside houses and imagining the residents  lives  One particular trackside house in the village of Witney is occupied by a young couple whom she names  Jess  and  Jason   four houses down the track is the house Rachel and husband Tom lived in until their divorce  Tom still lives there with his former mistress and new wife  Anna  and their daughter  Evie  To compound the interconnections  Jess has temporarily worked as Anna and Tom s babysitter  Rachel is alone  lonely  and living with Cathy  a former classmate who pities her  Rachel is an alcoholic whose art gallery has failed  who was fired from her next job at an ad agency  and who has lost her bearings  She is angry  lost  and subject to blackouts  a truly pitiful person who stalks Tom and Anna  and is obsessed with their neighbors  Jess  and  Jason   And something lurks in the background  on one commute Rachel notices some women s clothes lying at track side  The image haunts her   was the wearer murdered or in an accident  or are the clothes simply trash  Rachel is not the only wounded bird  Megan  Rachel s  Jesse   and Scott   Jason   have their own problems  Scott is a jealous and perhaps violent man who occassionally erupts at Megan  and who tracks Megan s emails  Megan s sad history  of which Scott is largely unaware  suggests much to be jealous about  Meghan is unhappy  she suffers from panic attacks  she has an affair with her therapist  and she goes missing on a night when Rachel has been seen in her neighborhood stalking Tom and Anna while drunk  As Meghan s disappearance becomes permanent  Rachel becomes a  person of interest   She is released and warned by the police to stay away from Tom and Anna  But she is her own worst enemy  she simply can t leave bad enough alone  She intrudes into the story like a bulldozer in a dining room  thrashing about as she seeks understanding  connectedness  and attention  She is guilty   of overacting  if nothing else  Rachel really is crazy  But one wonders if she is crazy like a fox  As she tears into the lives of Tom  Anna  and Scott   Jason   after Meghan s disappearance  we discover that they also have tragically damaged histories  Happiness is not a commodity in the village of Witney  though its surface is calm  A subtext of the novel is the fallibility of memory  Rachel s blackouts are permanent  possibly because  as we learn  alcoholic blackouts aren t a matter of not retrieving memories  rather  they are episodes in which memories simply aren t formed  And even those memories that are recovered are highly unreliable  Memory is dipping into a box of photos and pulling out random images to fill in the blanks  Rachel is trying to recover her history from a diary filled with blank pages Paula Hawkins is adept at building up tension  releasing it slowly  then doing it again  It makes this a very good read  one doesn t know true from false  good from bad  salvageable from irreparably damaged  lover from devil  The fates of the protagonists twist in the breeze until the final revelation  If you like suspense with subtlety  and a cast of interesting characters  none of whom are virtuous  you ll get a treat reading this book  Five stars  This is the second high profile thriller I ve read this year  but this one really lives up to the hype  I like books where the author only reveals some things but does it so smoothly it doesn t feel manipulative  Also  she did a great job of creating a main character who walked the line of being unlikeable   This book reminded me a lot of Gone Girl  I loved the fact that each narrator had their own secrets so you were always wondering about what was going through their heads at any given time   The book does jump back and forth every so slightly but this is a conscious decision due to the narrative   I highly recommend this book to fans of Gone Girl   Engrossing mystery   wraps up a little too tidy but a good four and a half star read   I Have to give it five stars because it was just the most overtly voyeuristic book I think I ve ever read  I felt like I was spying on the characters and they were  none of them  particularly likeable but you just couldn t look away  I m not much of a critic but I thought that was clever writing  Anyway  as you re reading it you feel like there s a train wreck  pun intended  just waiting to happen  A sense of real menace builds throughout as the characters lurch towards an inevitable horror  Waiting for more from this author Before I started reading this book  I saw so many negative reviews about the characters  I was hesitant to dive into the book for fear of disappointment  Now  after reading it  I see why people thought all of the characters were flawed  but now why that is such a bad thing  Each person in this story had such a deep profile and engaging history  I couldn t help but like each one of them  despite or maybe because of how flawed they each were  The only problem I had was about halfway through when Rachel was wrestling with her drinking and trying to sort out forgotten memories  I found reading her chapters frustrating and difficult to continue for very long  And then one day  it clicked  I was feeling Rachel s frustration  I was swimming with her through her drunk confusion and patchwork memories from the black outs  I was then unable to put the book down  even getting scolded at work for going past my lunch hour  ignoring my sandwich and disgesting as much of her story as I could   The Girl on the Train was so enjoyable  I m going against my policy of loaning books out and sharing this with whomever I can  This is the first Paula Hawkins books that I ve read  and I really enjoyed it  It kept me wanting to keep reading and not put it down  The plot twists are great  keeps you thinking and guessing  One of the best books I ve read lately  I highly recommend it  I ve been waiting for a book like this for awhile now  I loved it  Rachel has a drinking problem that has effected her life in many ways  It destroyed her marriage  caused her to lose her job  etc  Yet  she still takes the train every day at the same time just so her roommate doesn t know that she is out of work  Rachel invents imaginary scenarios of what is happening in the houses along the train route  that is until she sees something that relates directly to a missing person  With all of that said  this is a murder mystery that reads like  Gone Girl   told alternatively from a variety of different characters  This engaging story unravels  twists and turns throughout the entire novel  It s definitely worth the read   Actual rating  4 5  There is something comforting at the sight of strangers safe at home   I was hesitant to pick this book up because I wasn t that much familiar with the psychological thriller genre  but curiosity got the best of me and I ended up trying it out  I haven t even read watched Gone Girl  yet  Never mind that people have been saying that this book is really creepy  and that I m a coward and generally avoid creepy things  What could go wrong  right Everyone in this book was fucking messed up  They were twisted  Most of all    they cannot be trusted    even the three women narrating this story  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  Absolutely trust nobody  These people aren t what you think they are   My mother used to tell me that I had an overactive imagination  Tom said that  too  I can t help it  I catch sight of these discarded scraps  a dirty T shirt or a lonesome shoe  and all I can think of is the other shoe and the feet that fitted into them   Meet Rachel  She takes the train to and fro everyday  She s the kind of girl who likes to observe her surroundings and imagine what the lives of people are like  She makes up stories in her head and invents different scenarios surrounding these people  One couple in particular caught her interest  She called them  Jason and Jess   and they were Rachel s definition of a perfect couple with a perfect life  They remind her of what her life was like not so long ago  when she still had a promising future But something bad happened that completely shook things up  Things weren t what they seemed to be  Rachel saw something  and she just had to get involved  Even if people don t believe her  Even if people will think she s crazy  Even if her life gets put in danger What I liked about this book is its air of mystery  The secrets were endless  Information wasn t spoon fed and the author was in no hurry to establish the characters  backgrounds  Just when you think you ve got a character all figured out  something gets revealed and you will end up questioning just how much you know this character  The narrators were very unreliable  but they were written well  There s a depth to their personality  They might not have the best morals  but they felt very real  I didn t relate to these characters  but I sympathized with them  I can even go far as to say I cared for their fate The Girl on the Train was gripping  full of angst  and very  unputdownable   I expected it would take me long to finish this book but I finished it in just one sitting  I will read Gone Girl next  just to see what the comparison is all about   End of review  SPOILERS AHEAD  Reading spoilers before you read the book will ruin it for you in this case  This was a great book  It was billed as the next Gone Girl  which I always hear with trepidation because Gone Girl wasn t all that  but I thought this ended up being far superior  First  I had no sure read on whodunnit and second  it didn t have a totally heinous ending  Having so many unreliable narrators made me question everything and ultimately helped obscure the true story until the satisfying reveal  I had all sorts of crazy theories  including the idea that the entire book was in Rachel s head and not real at all  As I said above  I was glad that I avoided reading too much about the book so that I could enjoy the experience of trying to figure out  and failing  what was going on  I think it s rare to have a true surprise ending these days and this one delivered   How do I even begin this review  All I can say is  that was unexpected     Although I did have some doubts about that one character  who s name I will not mention so I don t spoil it  Their life story was quite odd to me  But  I guess in the end  ALL of their stories were a bit messed up  If you re looking for a psychological thriller  this one is definitely for you   Wow  Did not see that one coming at all   The Girl on the Train is Paula Hawkin s debut novel  And oh  what a debut  Rachel rides the train to London every day  keeping up the pretense that she she still has a job and a place to be  In fact she doesn t   her alcoholism has cost much   her husband  her job and her home  Adding salt to her wounds is the fact that the train makes at the station by her old neighbourhood  Twice a day  Rachel passes by this row of houses by the station  She often sees a couple she has named Jess and Jason in their garden and has created a fairy tale life for them   one she imagines she might have had  Then one day she sees Jess kissing someone else  And then she sees on the news that the woman she calls Jess is missing  Rachel takes her information to the police   but can t leave it be and she slowly insinuates herself into the investigation     The Girl on the Train is told from three different viewpoints   that of Rachel  the missing woman and Rachel s ex husband s new wife But it is Rachel driving the story   and she is a deliciously unreliable narrator  She drinks to blackout and often cannot remember where she has been or what she has done  But the flashes of clarity she does have frighten her    Something happened  I know it did  I can t picture it  but I can feel it  I m frightened  but I m not sure what I m afraid of  which just exacerbates the fear  The missing woman also tells her story  leading up to the day she disappears  She too is an unreliable narrator  concealing her past and lying about her present Hawkins keeps the reader guessing as the story twists and turns  changing with every revelation  memory and action  Who is telling the truth  What did really happen  I had my suspicions as the number of pages left to read dwindled and literally couldn t put the book down until I finished   Pick a nice lazy day to start The Girl on the Train   you won t want to do anything else Hawkins  depiction of alcoholism is troubling but highly effective as a plot device  I ve also traveled by rail and was easily able to put myself in a seat looking out   wondering about someone else s life The Girl on the Train is a great psychological thriller and is absolutely recommended  Dreamworks Studio has also optioned the movie rights Loved it  Did figure it out towards the middle but loved it anyway  AUTHOR  Hawkins  PaulaTITLE  The Girl on the TrainDATE READ  08 30 15RATING  5 AGENRE PUB DATE PUBLISHER   OF PGS Crime Fiction   2015  Penguin  323 pages SERIES STAND ALONE  stand aloneCHARACTERS Rachel girl on the train  Megan missing young woman  Anna 2nd wife to TomTIME PLACE  Present UK FIRST LINES  There is a pile of clothing on the side of the train tracks  COMMENTS  This is a debut novel    a psychological crime fiction    that despite all the hype really came through for me  I was engaged from the get go  Rachel is a depressed woman in her early 30 s that is in denial and is drinking to escape  She is a recently divorced and her husband is remarried  She has never accepted why her marriage really ended and is mourning the fact that she was barren while married  Her drinking has escalated and ia the cause for her dismissal from her job  She is renting a room from a friend but doesn t tell her that she is no longer employed   puts up the front that she still goes to work every day  While riding the daily train she observes from the window and she has imagined life scenarios for the various residents she sees regularly  When one of these women goes missing     Rachel feels she must get involved  This book is told via the perspective of 3 pivotal women  Rachel  the girl on the trail  Megan the young woman who is missing and Anna  the wife who replaced Rachel   Read this book it 2 days  Couldn t put it down I really enjoyed this  suspenseful and a great whodunit  Rachel has always wished for an ideal life  a satisfying career and a loving husband and family  But  when Rachel discovers she is unable to have children  she sink into a depression and begins to drink  As her alcoholism worsens  she loses her husband  home and job  Fearing her flatmate and landlord discovering her unemployment  she takes the train into London each morning  One of the stops is her old neighborhood and affords her a backyard view of a lovely home often used by the residents  a couple whose life she fantasizes about even naming the residents  Jason and Jess  Longing for her old marriage  she begins harassing phone calls to her ex husband upsetting his current wife  However  during one stop she discovers Jess kissing another man  After several drinks  she decides to take the train to her old neighborhood to investigate  When she awakens the next day  she discovers herself with a hangover  naked in bed  covered with dirt  bruises  lacerations and dried blood with no memory of what happened  A couple of days later she reads in the newspaper  that Jess now Megan  is missing  which leads the police to her door since she was identified by her ex husband and new wife as being in the neighborhood in front of Megan s home the night of her disappearance  The night Rachel doesn t remember  This novel is told from the perspective of three women  each with their respective flaws  which make each an unreliable narrator  The plot of this psychological thriller is structured in a manner that to make the novel a true page turner  If Alfred Hitchcock was still alive  this would his next film  I highly recommend for your reading pleasure Thrilling twists and turns all the way through to the end  Reminds me of a certain Carrie Underwood song  and it s not  before he cheats     Definitely a must read  especially if you re into darker literature   Wow  I ve read quite a few comments from people saying that they didn t understand all of the hoopla  Having just finished this incredible novel I am confounded as to how anyone could have felt that way  Yes  it s a whodunit page turner with quite a few twists and revelations  But at the heart of it  this is a stunningly accurate portrait of a alcoholic  Alcoholism is prevalent in my own family and I recognized so many of the characteristics of the disease in Rachel  For me  this was less a mystery novel and more of a horror novel  The author did an extremely good job of making the reader feel the terror of what it s like to wake up covered in blood and not remember how it got there  That scenario itself could have been such a cliche  but the writer managed to make it feel fresh  Loved this book   This is probably the most exciting book I have read in a while  From the moment I picked it up there was no putting it down  I was glued to it  The characters are so well fleshed out that I can t help but hate them seethingly  It s beautiful when a book can inspire such strong passion  or hate  in you  The plot unravels slowly taking its own sweet time but never languidly  It s still gripping enough that it has you at the edge of your seat  The ending is unexpected and doesn t disappoint  loved every word  Viena no gramatam  no kuras izvairijos nezinamu

way    what dark secrets hide between closed doors and curtained windows This books is captivating and thrilling and it will make you think and re think what you see around you    Page turner  Enjoyed every page   Read it in two days  Could not put it down  Suspenseful and intriguing   Die depressive und alkoholabhangige Rachel fuhrt ein tristes Leben  doch jeden Tag fahrt sie mit dem Zug und beobachtet ein ganz bestimmtes Paar  sie sieht ihr perfektes Gluck und wunscht sich genau das fur sich selbst  Sie fuhlt sich mit dem Paar verbunden und hat ihre ganz eigene Vorstellung von Jess und Jason die eigentlich Scott und Megan heissen Doch an einem Tag wird ihre wunderschone Vorstellung von den beiden zerstort  sie beobachtet ein schockierendes Ereignis und sie ist mit Wut erfullt Nur kurze Zeit spater prangt Megans Gesicht alle Zeitungen  die junge Frau ist verschwunden und die Polizei tappt ahnunsglos im Dunkeln Rachel fuhlt sich dazu verpflichtet ihre Beobachtung mitzuteilen und dann wird sie in den Strudeln der Ereignisse gerissen   Gestaltung Ich mag es  dass das Cover so dunkel ist und auch ansonsten eher schlicht gehalten hat  es lasst die Gefahr hervortreten und macht einfach Lust  ich finds optisch wirklich toll  Meinung Auf das Buch war ich schon lange wahnsinnig gespannt  ich bin allgemein nicht so der Thriller Fan  aber es gibt bestimmte Bucher die mich dann doch ansprechen und unglaublich neugierig machen und Girl on the Train gehort zu diesen Buchern Bereits der Anfang konnte mich von sich uberzeugen  ich mochte von Anfang an die Erzahlweise  wir lesen zu einem aus der Perspektive von Rachel und zum anderen aus der von Megan allerdings findet ihre Erzahlung ein Jahr zuvor statt  Dadurch lernen wir Megan kennen und begreifen schnell  dass Rachels Traumvorstellung von ihr nicht der Wahrheit entspricht  Ich fand es sehr spannend ihren Weg bis zu ihrem verschwinden zu verfolgen und war gespannt was sich alles uber sie offenbaren wurde  Und wie oder ob es Zusammenhange zwischen ihr und Rachel gibt Denn Rachel ist nicht wirklich leicht zu durchschauen  sie leidet unter einigen Blackouts  die durch ihre Abhangigeit von Alkohol entstehen und auch sonst wirkt sie nicht wie die klarste und vertrauenvollste Person Zumal ihr Verhalten auch manches Mal wirklich bedrohlich scheint  so hat sie nicht nur eine Faszination zu Megan und Scott aufgebaut sie tyrannisiert auch immer noch ihren Ex  die in der gleichen Strasse wohnen  und seine neue Freundin und war ausgerechnet am Tag von Megans verschwinden wieder dort  hat allerdings einen Filmriss Ich konnte die Charaktere insgesamt alle nicht leiden  sie waren alle von ihren Problemen erfullt und insgesamt ziemlich ich bezogen  dennoch fand ich das nicht schlimm und konnte sie gut ertragen  Und dennoch schwankte ich immer zwischen Mitleid und Abscheu zu ihnen und ihrem Handeln  Erst im letzten Drittel konnten Megan und Rachel bei mir an Sympathie gewinnen  was ich sehr schon fand Dadurch  dass die Charaktere alle so kaputt waren hat das Buch eine ganz bedruckende und depressive Stimmung bekommen die wirklich auf mich abfarben konnte  es war also nicht immer einfach mich in Rachels Leben zu begeben aber dennoch ging eine grosse Faszination von ihr und dem Geschehen aus  der ich mich auch nicht entziehen konnte  Im spateren kommt dann auch noch die Sichtweise von Anna hinzu  sie ist die neue Frau von Tom und so werden auch diese Charaktere naher in die Geschichte mit einbezogen und lassen die Zweifel an Rachel wachsen und neue wuste Vermutungen entstehen durch ihre Schilderungen Ich hab wirklich lange gebraucht um die Puzzleteile zusammen zu fugen  es kamen so viele Tater in Betracht und ich fand es auch schon zu ratseln  das Buch ladt dazu wirklich ein  Nach einer Weile konnte ich mich dann schon auf eien Theorie festlegen und die hat sich dann auch bestatigt  Schlimm fand ich es nicht  denn dann gab es ja immer noch den Showdown  die Konfrontation und ich muss wirklich sagen  dass die es in sich hatte Ich war wirklich aufgeregt und hab ein kribbeln gespurt  vielleicht auch weil ich Thriller eher weniger lese  aber es hat bei mir wirklich Gansehaut verursacht  das Ende hat mich wirklich packen konnen  ich war wirklich aufgeregt und klebte an den Seiten   Das Ende hat mich wirklich vollkommen begeistert zuruck gelassen und ich konnte dem Buch definitiv verzeihen  dass es zwischendrin zu einem kleinen Hanger gab  weil ich das Gefuhl hatte auf der Stelle zu treten Fazit Es ist ein ungewohnlicher Thriller  die Charaktere zielen nicht darauf ab sympathisch zu sein und man weiss nie ob man sie bemitleiden oder fur ihr sein und tun verabscheuen soll  auch ist die Spannung Anfangs eher unterschwelig da  aber am Ende ist sie da und konnte mich richtig packen  Dennoch ist es eigentlich von Anfang an interessant  weil Rachels obsessives und bedrohliches Verhalten fur so viel Zweifel und Spekulationen sorgt  man mochte einfach wissen was hinter der Geschichte steht  so dass ich dieses Buch definitiv nicht aus den Handen nehmen konnte ehe es zu Ende war  So intense and twisted  got me hooked from page one to the very end Oh how I enjoyed this book  It is a tautly written page turner  Like many books in this genre  it s hard to identify fully with any of the characters  yet it reads as psychologically true  Don t start this book if you have anything else to do  your life will be on hold for a few hours while you finish this   Although this book was full of melodramatic suspense and characters I did not like  I couldn t put it down after I passed the first 50 or so pages  At that point I realized that the characters were all such terrible people that anyone could have been a suspect  Also by the last 100 pages I was dying to get the full replay of what happened  The suspense in the storyline built up well  The ending was pretty flat  it made me say  that s it   But it also made me wonder what the outcome is for any of the characters involved  Maybe one of the guys in this story should get a spinoff novel about them  Food for thought  Bottom line  I would recommend this book  twice  to anyone who likes suspense and to anyone who loves or loves to loathe certain characters I bought this because it was popular on Amazon and I wasn t disappointed  It is a very skilful  rich  and compelling first novel Some books take you all over the world  This takes you deep inside the personal world of three struggling individuals  and it is that detailed portrayal of character and the abundance of fluid but crafted detail from inside their heads that makes it so interesting and the plot so plausible  In their own ways all three characters are unpredictable  I found that this added an extra level of tension in the book  There was clearly threat in the foreground  but because you didn t quite know what the characters might do next  there was always a second level of possible disaster lurking in the background On the surface  you wouldn t think anything much could happen   a woman regularly commutes on a train  You are lulled into a false sense of security to start with  However  once the plot begins to unravel you do feel the frustration of the main protagonist trying to divert disaster as she wrestles with those who dismiss her and manipulate her  as well as with her own self inflicted demons A good  entertaining read that was difficult to put down  Well  first off  I have to say I read this book while on a train trip from Milwaukee to Portland  Oregon  It was endlessly amusing to be a girl on the train reading The Girl On The Train That aside  this was a stunning book  You can t just classify it as a mystery   there s so much more to it than that  A study of alcoholism  post traumatic stress disorder  relationships  grief   it s all there  And when it comes to the mystery   and this isn t a spoiler   the author did a brilliant job of weaving everyone into the possibilities About the only criticism I can give is that I had difficulty accepting the black outs that Rachel had  I don t disbelieve in black outs   but hers were so conveniently placed  They felt sometimes contrived  But that s not enough to make me knock it down a star  and it wasn t enough to keep me from reading like a freight train through this book  Pun intended Excellent  At first it s a bit puzzling wondering where the author is leading you  The book is told from different perspectives  which adds to the intrigue  As each character narrates  their story becomes more defined  yet the reader still is left wondering what is real  It isn t until all the pieces come together that we fully understand what happened  A definite page turner the more I read   Whoa  First of all  I listened to this book rather than read it  it made an excellent audio book  The story is a good one  moving along at a good pace  The main character s sadness and inability to get a grip on herself is something we can all understand  especially as the story unfolds and we understand more of what has happened to her  The author kept me guessing as to who the killer was right along with Rachel  main character   the reader only sees the truth one step ahead of Rachel  It is somewhat like Gone Girl in the twists and surprises that come to light  but the story hangs together better than Gone Girl  To me  it was a more believable story  The ending is also more satisfying  I recommend this book as a good read and as a good listen  LOVE this book   so good  Listened to this one on Audible com and the narrators totally make this book awesome  Some language and violence  but overall at least 5 stars  This intriguing psychological thriller had me from page 1 and I loved the whole journey   the premise of Rachel constructing lives and personalities for people she observes from the train to make up for her own unhappy life was interesting and provided a great base for a book  As the story unfolded I was drawn into the lives of the  very dysfunctional  characters and could not put the book down  A refreshingly different story   as a train commuter from way back I could relate to the whole premise of getting a glimpse into people s lives from behind a glass window and seeing things out of context which are open for interpretation and flights of imagination   what a great way to base a murder mystery on it  Very highly recommended PS  I hate it that every new thriller featuring a dysfunctional   troubled female main character is being compared to  Gone Girl    personally I think this story was nothing like it  This is the book I d been waiting for  You know when you re in a reading slump and nothing grabs your attention  That was me  Then I read this  Now I miss it  Go now  Clear your schedule  Read this book  I m jealous it s you and not me  Oh my heck  Wowzers    this is a great book  I read all the comparisons to Gone Girl  and I can say    yes  if you liked that book  or liked reading it  but hated the characters in the book    you ll like this one too Horrible people  doing horrible things    it s kinda like watching Horders on TV    you can look at them and think   I m not so bad   I listened to this one on audiobook and the multiple voice recording was great  My only trouble with this one    and I m sure it is just because I was listening  was that I couldn t quite keep the dates of the chapters straight  Nevertheless  it was a very enjoyable read listen  Loved loved loved this book Really compelling  and you won t work out whodunit until the end The story is told from three different viewpoints and it can be hard to know who s account is most reliable The main narrator is a drunk  with holes in her memory and a life that is falling apart  She is the girl on the train  who gets glimpses into another couples life The only thing I didn t like was the date difference between the three characters  sometimes I had to look back to check what date was being written about it A summer must read book   Kept me in suspense the whole book  Loved it   I couldn t put this book down  loved reading it I don t usually read thrillers or am particularly interested in them but this one was really good  I get why it created a hype lately and I feel like everyone read it  like they should    The book deals with depression  lies  abuse  alcoholism all wrapped up in a mystery of who did it  I m glad that the end is not completely obvious from the beginning  but we gradually get more information and paint the whole picture of what actually happened  this book is very clever with lots of plot twists and characters woven together  a great read and good story  I was hooked from page one  which is rare   usually it takes me a little while to get familiar with the characters  the setting  the writing style  etc  Not so with this novel  I really loved the writing style and I liked the format of the book   each chapter was told in the past tense from one of the female characters  perspectives  with each day delineated like an entry in a journal  It made the events feel more real and also inevitable and the story fast paced and suspenseful As with many mysteries  none of the characters are quite what they first appear  and it is fascinating to be able to get to know them better and better as the story unfolds and the reader is able to see what is behind the facade of each person  The mystery is certainly secondary to the character development  but that is not at all a bad thing  The driving force behind the overarching story is Rachel  the main narrator  who is at the lowest point in her life and has an almost overwhelming desire to feel useful and involved  To all of the other characters  she is a pitiful human being and a pest  but  ironically  her peskiness and obsession with other people s lives actually ends up helping in the end Around three quarters of the way through the book the light bulb went off and I had the basic points of the mystery figured out  which was surely intentional by the author  The suspense  however  didn t stop there  if anything  it increased  as I willed Rachel to figure it out too This is one of those mysteries that are difficult to put down once you pick them up   it draws you in and messes with your head and has you questioning the reliability of all the characters  I look forward to reading more by this author  Oh  my  This book  It s been a long time since I ve read a book so suspenseful it kept me on the edge of my seat  While reading the final 50 pages  my stomach was in knots every time I got to a Rachel chapter  clenched tightly  fearing what would happen next  Oh  my  what a smart  stupid woman  She made so many poor choices  got herself into so many dangerous situations  I found myself admonishing her numerous times   Don t do it  Don t go over there   But she didn t listen  not to me  and not to her gut instincts  Her instincts were so good  so right on  and she ignored them every time  Okay  now that I ve gotten that out of the way  let me take a deep breath  I should back up a bit  and say that I was unsure about this book for the first 40 45 pages  It gets off to a slow start  with nothing really happening  But  after page 50 or so  it starts to pick up speed  and by the last 50  it barrels along nonstop   much like a train picks up speed  you might say  I really appreciated the way Paula Hawkins wrote the story  alternating sections among the three women  Notice  though  that Megan s chapters are in past time  but then they have to be  don t they  And Hawkins does an exemplary job catching her story up to the climax in the real life time of the other two characters  She is a master at building suspense  I can t wait to see what she does next  couldn t put it down I listened to this book via Audible and it was just so good  I don t do audio books very often but this was so well done  The different readers from the different perspectives did an amazing job and it helped me to get that much more interested in the book  I usually listen while I wait for my daughter to get out of school which is about 20 30 minutes a day and I just LOVE when I m so captivated that I bring it in the house with me and try to squeeze in as much of the story as I can   view spoiler  You can t help but feel so sorry for Rachel and at the same time you understand everyone else s frustrations  A couple of times I wanted to smack her and say JUST REMEMBER    I m glad she came to realize that everything wasn t her fault and she was at the hands of an abuser  Props to her for trying to save Anna instead of saying  screw it  she deserves what she gets  I really loved Megan s character  There was an underlying realness to her even though she was full of lies  Do you ever REALLY know someone  Everyone has their secrets and their quirks  I don t agree with everything she did but at the same time I can sympathize with her  Everyone has their demons and inner truths Anna was an irritating narcissistic person and it bit her in the ass but I m so proud of her in the end  She did what needed to happen   hide spoiler  I just saw yesterday that they re already in the process of making this into a movie    YAAAY    There could not have been a better choice for Rachel than Emily Blunt   Perfect   I was picturing more of a Kiera Knightly for Megan but we ll see about Haley Bennett  Super excited  This is an engaging and entertaining read  While on the surface it seems to be your classic thriller pushed forward by voyeurism  alcoholic blackouts and heartbreak that s become obsession  there are some really though provoking questions posed here about relationships  women s treatment and the lengths we re willing to go for our own self interest  Do any of us know when enough is enough   Loved loved loved  Had me hooked from the first few pages  Even though it was essentially a  whodunnit  is also managed to be quite character driven and I felt I really got to know Rachel  Not once before it was revealed did I guess who the killer was   4 5 stars  A must read  Could not put it down  The girl on the train is an alcoholic mixed up in a murder mystery   a very creepy psychologic thriller  Excellently written story of apparently ordinary people  some of whom turn out to be not chat the reader was expecting  A classic reminder that what we see on the surface is often not what lies beneath it   Devushka v poezde     roman 2015 goda britanskoi pisatel nitsy Poly Khokins v zhanre psikhologicheskogo trillera V SShA vyshel v svet 13

female Londoner who retrospectively quits the present and goes back to performing activities with her unmentioned close friends   The Girl on the Train  by Paula Hawkins examines inebriety and domestic violence in a fully developed country  England  The intoxicated late 20s woman knows the people and Victorian houses of London  by heart   Rachel copes with alcoholism and makes readers foreshadow the genesises of how Rachel ended up being a  black sheep   Rachel has memorized the surroundings that are in her area  houses and people  Rachel knows houses that she passes by in the train  by heart   Number fifteen is much like the other houses along this stretch of track  a Victorian semi  two storeys high  overlooking a narrow  well tended garden that runs around twenty feet down towards some fencing  beyond which lie a few metres of no man s land before you get to the railway track  I know this house by heart  I know every brick  I know the colour of the curtains in the upstairs bedroom  beige  with a dark blue print   I know that the paint is peeling off the bathroom window frame and that there are four tiles missing from a section of the roof over on the right hand side   Hawkins 18   Rachel knows the description and habits of Jason and Jess  a couple living in the suburbia  I know that on warm summer evenings  the occupants of this house  Jason and Jess  sometimes climb out of the large sash window to sit on the makeshift terrace on top of the kitchen extension roof  They are a perfect  golden couple  He is dark haired and well built  strong  protective  kind  He has a great laugh  She is one of those tiny bird women  a beauty  pale skinned with blond hair cropped short  She has the bone structure to carry that kind of thing off  sharp cheekbones dappled with a sprinkling of freckles  a fine jaw   Hawkins 19   In conclusion  Rachel has conned her surroundings Signs of intoxication begin to become evident  Rachel begins adumbrating how she s committed something louche  Rachel is frequently inebriated   I open one of the bottles of Chenin Blanc I purchased from the Whistletop at Euston  It s not cold  but it ll do  I pour some into a plastic cup  screw the top back on and slip the bottle into my handbag  It s less acceptable to drink on the train on a Monday  unless you re drinking with company  which I am not   Hawkins 21   Rachel makes readers foreshadow that she has perpetrated a disreputable act  that she s a pariah   I don t know whether they see me  though  for what I really am   Hawkins 21   To conclude  Rachel gets intoxicated and makes readers hint at her commitment of something disreputable The suspicion begins to clarify and Rachel s train advances to another area at London  The foreshadowing increases while Rachel says that the pile of clothes from last week is still there  and it looks dustier and more forlorn than it did a few days ago   The pile of clothes from last week is still there  and it looks dustier and more forlorn than it did a few days ago   Hawkins 23   Rachel s train went from the suburbs of London to somewhere else  The train went from the suburbia of Victorian houses to grimy North London the closer to Euston  the more anxious Rachel feels  The doubts are increasing  Rachel s mobile dwelling  proceeds to another setting The melancholia of Rachel worsens and worsens with incremental alcohol habits  An important event will occur in North London   foreshadowing it   The intoxicated late 20s woman knows the people and Victorian houses of London  by heart   Rachel copes with alcoholism and makes readers foreshadow the genesises of how Rachel ended up being an outcast  May 10th  2015From the simple quote by D H  Sidebottom   Stars can t shine without darkness   Rachel needs to overcome her research for happiness by simply dwelling in a  dark  nonchalant  world without Scott as a left shoulder devil  with the darkness  Rachel  can shine by continuing a prosperous life at her office  Paula Hawkins  psychological novel examines a mid 30s  constantly inebriated woman that spills the truth  bit by bit  about how Scott  an ex partner  diverged and went his own way  At first  Rachel discovers her reproduction related handicap and despairs  then gets interrogated by a curious police officer  and finally gets legally warned to not approach certain people  and gets jealous about the way Scott moved on The providence of Rachel loses hope by discovering that a main element of ongoing life is disabled  Rachel is barren  or cannot be impregnated  she is shocked about the fact that it s her  fault  and not her sexually productive ex partner s   It didn t happen  No doctor has been able to explain to me why I can t get pregnant  I m young  fit enough  I wasn t drinking heavily when we were trying  My husband s sperm was active and plentiful   Hawkins 125   Rachel shows that she is providentially blinded by the moms and their children she sees in the supermarket she goes to  The protagonist says that she was better now  because before  jealousy would manipulate her into leaving the supermarket  In conclusion  Rachel is hindered by the fact that can t reproduce The police officer is suspecting that Rachel is not claiming any truthful fact about the occurrence and therefore elongated the expected timing of the interrogation  Riley  the police officer at the station suspected that Rachel is lying about what happened with her traitor s baby and wife  guessed because of her evident  previous drunkenness    Well  I love to say that to me  your behavior suggests that as Mrs  Watson implied you are unwilling to move on   Hawkins 132   Riley and Gaskill want to dig deep   behind  and not  on  the investigation of the disappearance of Megan Watson  they don t want to feel remorse afterwards  if Rachel commits suicide out of depression or disappears too  out of dissatisfaction  Rachel even mocks Riley about not having better things to do like investigating on the disappearance rather than questioning an innocent woman  In conclusion  Rachel leaves by ignoring Riley but by shaking Gaskill s hand  The barren woman gets warned about contacting the suspects and reads through articles  retrospecting about her glorious past with Scott  Gaskill warns Rachel to not approach her ex partner and a suspicious road that might be an opposing weapon to Rachel   Don t contact your ex husband unless    Don t go anywhere near Blenheim road  Hawkins 136   The articles are being read and covetousness is being felt about how she and Scott were intimate and happy together but ended up losing every mutuality  David Clark  from the Daily Mail refers to Megan and Scott as having been a great couple and always happy together  To conclude  Rachel gets warned but  cheats  by reading the articles Rachel Watson has reached the truth as to where the readers can guess that Rachel s entourage is inactive and unmentioned because of her drinking habits  At first  Rachel discovers her reproduction related handicap and despairs  then gets interrogated by a curious police officer  and finally gets legally warned to not approach certain people  and gets jealous about the way Scott moved on  For an advice  as a result  an individual needs to live happily and destroy any hinting sign of future discontent  Makes for a nice racy read  Reviewed for http   theereaderjunkie wordpress comRate 4 5 rounded up to 5Featured image This book was all  the  buzz a few months ago  it s been reviewed almost everywhere and as I closed it a few seconds before typing this  I can see clearly why  It s a very good psychological suspense and you can t drop it until the last page  Four of my coworkers are waiting for it and I m not even mentioning the readers of my library who have already asked for it  Huge success  then  so why didn t I give it a 5   Because there was a little  deja vu  element for me  The main character who was too drunk to remember what really happened  that  night  I ve read it before  simple as that  But I gave it a 4 5 anyway because the psychology of the characters is soooo very good I couldn t relate to any of them  but I sympathized with all the women at a moment or another   Rachel  who can be disgusting yet touching   Megan  such a butterfly but who experienced such tragedy   Anne  who stole another woman s husband and is trying hard to make herself believe that she leads a wonderful life  The story also showed how some men can manipulate women into believing that the way they treat them is acceptable  while it s absolutely not All in all  it was an excellent book and I probably wouldn t have been slightly  very slightly    disappointed if it hadn t been for all this buzz around it  Highly recommended    Whatttt  This book blew my mind  I thought as the book went a long I was totally figuring everything out  but then the ending I had it all wrong The Girl on the Train is written from 3 different People  Rachel  the drunk  Megan the missing girl  and Anna the mistress turned wife  If you liked Gone Girl than you will love The Girl on The Train   I just finished The Girl on the Train  It got five stars from me because it kept my attention making it hard to drag myself away from it to take care of other responsibilities  In the genre of Gone Girl  the story is based on a whodunit  However  the initial twenty pages or so may make you think  Chick Lit  because the story line dwells on one person s remorse over a lost marriage  If you like mysteries  hang in there  The wait is worth it  I think there s going to be a movie so read fast  I really enjoyed this book   it left me guessing until the end  Quite dark perspective from the viewpoint of an alcoholic but not depressing  I put it in the  stay up all night to finish  category  Obsession at its best  Another sick debut novel after Andrea Bustfield s  Really  I do not even have any favorite character  They re all lame  The story gave me some times of a sweet sensation of shadenfreude  tho  One of the reason why I love psy thriller genre  This is my favorite book  it is the most addicting and exciting book I have ever read  I believe I finished it after just a couple of days reading  Some people who have read this will problably say they don t like the main character Rachel  I on the other hand kinda love her  Even though she is an alcoholic person who just can t get her life right I really like her  This book made me angry at times  and I could seriously not leave it  The book also had me mindblown more than once  and after this I can t get enough of thrillers   Rachel is the girl on the train who rides daily on the 8 04 from her flat into London to a job she no longer holds  For months she has been hiding the truth that she was fired from her job after getting drunk during a business lunch and insulting a client  Her life has spiraled into drunken despair after her marriage dissolved due to her alcohol abuse  exacerbated by her inability to conceive a baby  and her husband s infidelity  Her daily train journey takes her right through the back yard of the house on Blenheim Road where she used to live with her husband Tom  now his home with his new wife Anna and baby Evie  Rachel also watched from the train another apparently happy couple who live just down the street   she calls them Jason and Jess When Jess  whose real name is Megan  goes missing  Rachel inserts herself into the story by contacting Jason  whose real name is Scott  to tell him that she had seen Megan kissing another man in the backyard  She lied to Scott  telling him that she had met Megan several times at her gallery  The mystery of Megan s disappearance is told in chapters that alternate between first person accounts of Rachel  Megan and Anna  At different points throughout the novel  you suspect almost every character of being the possible killer  though by the last 10 15  of the novel   whodunit  becomes clear  and it s just a matter of tying up the loose ends and proving that person is the culprit The plot was entertaining and detailed enough  but none of the characters are particularly likable or appealing   they all have annoying character defects  and they re all liars  Rachel is a pathetic alcoholic  unable to pull herself out of her deep pool of self pity  Even her flatmate  Cathy  whose  niceness is writ large   is an enabler who puts up with Rachel s out of control drunken behavior  By the end of the novel  when the killer was identified and dealt with  I was just glad it was over  Full feature here in the first of my  Spotlight 2015  features for my blog http   lizlovesbooks com lizlovesbook   Review Text So in the first of my  Spotlight 2015  features coming up over the next few weeks  I m taking look at  The Girl on the Train  by Paula Hawkins   a tense and highly addictive thriller that will almost certainly keep you turning the pages well into the night in order to discover just what the outcome is for Rachel  Jason and Jess Rachel has problems  is a highly intriguing character and when we meet her she is on a train  The same train she gets every day  seeing the same things she sees every day   until one day she observes something unusual  This sets her on a path of discovery and on a journey towards destruction The whole thing is really excellent   the writing flows along  the characters pop and once you start it is very hard to put aside   one of those  just one more chapter then I ll load the dishwasher  type books that basically means the dishwasher is going to be rather lonely for a while   I particularly liked  or actually actively disliked at times  Rachel   who because of her background  is difficult to get a grasp on  Are there nefarious things going on or is it just her  Her dogged determination and often rather obscure decision making means that almost anything could be true and this is where the plot is intelligent  creative and why the whole novel is so addictive  Add to Rachel some other characters who may or may not be as they appear  including Rachel s seemingly reasonable ex husband  the couple who Rachel avidly observes from her train seat and various others and you have a most terrific mix which creates a character driven thriller of top notch quality Overall this is definitely one to look out for in the early months of 2015 and would definitely be a great book to get you over those  End of Holiday  blues once Christmas and New Year is over and done with   you ll soon get caught up in Rachel s world and this is a tremendously fun read with a dark heart and a great ending Highly Recommended I see why everyone suggests  Girl On The Train  if you ve read  Gone Girl   The shifting perspective  the unreliable narrators  the betrayal of trust  and the vulnerability of marriage  The mystery is held to the end and is a surprise  the true villain was unexpected for me  because of course by the time you get to the end  you ve passed through a number of suspects   It was very well written But     Every women in this book would be someone that I would cross the street to avoid in real life  All of them well written  excellently described  expertly rendered  completely annoying personalities  Though when bad things happen to them  you don t really fear for their safety  I read it in a single sitting on the plane from the east to west coast and it pulled me along  It would be a good beach read  Couldn t put it down and am so happy with the end result  I give it ALL OF THE STARS  Absolutely loved it  omg fantastic book a story that gripped me from beginning to end i read it in 2 days n ive recommemd it to friends This book is appropriately titled because it s like watching a train wreck   you simply can t look away  Mesmerized from the beginning  I could not put the book down until I was finished  I HAD to know the end  One review I read called it  Hitchcockian  and I could not agree more  It reminded me of the movie Rear Window  Told from three different women s points of view  The Girl On The Train is a suspense thriller at it s finest  I am a character driven reader and writer and the characters in this book are written brilliantly  Rachel is a literal train wreck herself but the author wrote her in such a way that I felt sorry enough for her to want to know her story  And I really wanted things to work out for her  The other characters were so full of mystery and intrigue I felt unease about each one  never truly knowing them or what they would do next  And I loved how the book ended  The author didn t leave the reader with frustrating unknowns but wraps it up in a way where I was satisfied but can t stop thinking about the story  Brilliant  Excellent read   I listened to the audio of this book and enjoyed it tremendously  Great voices for the characters  Superbly written  I ll be watching closely for her next book   As soon as I finished this book  I walked into the local bookstore where I work and told the owner that this book was going to be the next Gone Girl  Don t let that comparison fool you   this is no copycat effort Rachel is an alcoholic whose roommate has no idea that she no longer has a job  because each day she continues to commute to work on the train that goes past the house and neighborhood where she used to live  In her mind  she has built a life story for the people who live a few houses from her ex  husband  and each day  she adds a bit more  One day  she sees the woman who lives there with a man who is not her husband   and a few days later  this woman disappears You can t say much more than that without spoiling the whole kit and caboodle  but suffice it to say that I find it difficult to believe that Paula Hawkins is making her fictional debut with this novel  because it reeks of the type of professional plotting and twisting of readers  minds that generally can only be found in the work of well established authors  I don t think that the thriller genre will ever quite escape the Gone Girl comparisons  but when I reached the ending  I can honestly say that this novel should stand on equal footing  Well plotted  brilliantly told  and page turningly gripping  you won t regret the time you spend with The Girl on the Train  Wow  This book takes so many twists  It kept surprising me all the way through the last chapter  So unexpected   One of the most refreshing novels I have read in a while  It lived up to the hype  How could this be the author s first novel  WHOA    This book    It was such a good read  It had me up late reading until the wee hours of the morning  I simply couldn t put it down  The two main female characters are twisted  evil  and possibly crazy  I don t want to give too much away  This story does flip back and forth between the two main female characters  Megan and Rachel  Eventually a third character POV is brought in through some of the later chapters  This book is everything you could want from a good thriller  creepy  crazy  twisted  and plot twists you won t see coming  This is a must read  Go and read this book  I loved it    Haven t read a thriller in a while and this one did not disappoint  I expected to like this book in appropriate measure to its popularity  which is to say  I thought it would be just fine  Like  you know  easy to read  goes down quick  like Vino Verde   has a bit of voyeurism and mystery and human brokenness and redemption  It was all those things  but it was also more  an exploration of the lies we tell ourselves  an honest portrait of the ugly and complicated ways we try to pave over our pain  and a meditation on the ways memory gets distorted to suit our preferred world view   So it was good  I totally think you should read it   If you haven t read it  do   Genial libro  No podia dejar de leerlo   Me gusto mucho  me cautivo desde el principio y no podia dejar de pensar en teorias sobre quien habia sido  pero no me habia esperado ese desenlace  w   If you want a roller coaster ride this is your book  Poor Rachel cannot let go of the past or her ex husband who has married and fathered a child with his mistress  Every day Rachel rides the train past her old home that she once shared with Tom  The whole book she pines for Tom and delves deeper into alcoholism  She fixates on a beautiful married couple who drink wine in the sun on the porch  She creates fictitious names for them and looks forward to seeing them as one would fixate on their favorite television couple  Nothing is as perfect as it seems  This book teaches you that you never know what is really going on in someone else s seemingly perfect life  Read this is one sitting  Enough said  I love a good suspense psychological thriller  and this one more than satisfied that craving  I was glued to the pages of this book  Warning  the story unfolds slowly  but the slow progression allowed my apprehension to build until the final scenes  I have to say  I was surprised by the ending and the guilty party  The author really sucks you in  and I appreciated getting the different POVs  each person adding another little piece to the puzzle   Wow  Intense  I couldn t put it down  Rachel prend le train tous les jours pour aller et revenir de Londres  Elle en profite pour observer les maisons le long de la voie ferree et inventer la vie de leurs occupants  Le jour ou elle apprend la disparition d une des habitantes  tout va basculer Ce livre est un des meilleurs thrillers que j ai pu ecouter jusqu a present  Des le depart  l histoire m a emportee et elle ne m a pas lachee  Le suspens m a tenue en haleine de bout en bout  J ai adore le style d ecriture et aussi la facon dont le livre est lu   3 voix  une pour chacune des protagonistes  Je me suis beaucoup attachee aux personnages  notamment celui de Rachel  C est un gros gros coup de coeur    En bref   a lire   ecouter de toute urgence   Mmm  sis bija spidosi  Varbut nedaudz par atru es sapratu  kas ir vainigais  Vairak gan pec logiskiem apsverumiem  ne pec iespejamiem motiviem  bet  protams  ka tas netrauceja steigties uz gramatas noslegumu  lai visi punkti uz i saliktos  Burvigi  Apsolu sev parlasit  kad gramata iznaks latviski   Entertaining quick read   Great book  Be prepared for a very unreliable and usually inebriated narrator  false  false perceptions  tangled webs  red herrings  secrets revealed  and an unexpected ending in this suspenseful psychological thriller  Of the three narrators  Rachel  Megan  and Anna   Rachel is my favorite even though she is depressed  overweight  unemployed  unattractive  and full of self pity  She rides daily on a train from her flat share to London to keep up a pretense of still working  she was canned for being drunk   An unreliable narrator who has an imagination that frequently goes into overdrive  she makes up names and a fantasy life for two young and beautiful people whom she sees from her window on the train when it stops daily at her former neighborhood  She names the couple  Jess and Jason  and is convinced they are the perfect couple  One day when she sees  Jess  kissing a man on her terrace who is not  Jason   Rachel impetuously gets off the train to investigate  But she falls in the underpass  unable to remember what really happened when she awakens the next morning  Recurring motifs of a blue dress  a red haired man  and the underpass haunt Rachel as she tries to recall that night  She sees a news brief and a photo of  Jess   who is really Megan  and learns that she has disappeared last night  Rachel takes it upon herself to get involved in the case This psychological and suspenseful thriller involves characters whose perceptions are influenced by their flawed personalities  Rachel is divorced from Tom  who is now married to a more glamorous and beautiful wife and is a father of a young daughter  Jealous and lonely  Rachel can t stop herself from harassing them by calling Tom on his cell and landline  usually when she is drunk Megan is the second narrator and her account is of necessity in the past  She reveals a sordid past and true nature  which is so different from what Rachel has imagined  And Anna is the third narrator  who vacillates from being incensed by Rachel s intrusions to doing what needs to be done under extenuating circumstances at the end of the book When you think things can t get worse  they do  Hawkins leads the reader to and unexpected and thrilling ending that makes the whole  ride  so worthwhile  Fans of Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn will enjoy this novel  Un gran bel thriller  ricco di colpi di scena e con una storia ben raccontata  Un po  facile capire chi e il colpevole forse  ma cio non toglie nulla alla qualita  alta  del libro  Ti prende da subito e non ti molla  consigliatissimo  Highly addicting  The characters are interesting  You learn the story from several different angles and really don t know  who dun it  until the very end  I listened to the audio version and it was very well read  I don t normally read much off of any best selling lists  I think most times it is a lot of hype to get a book sold  But I took a chance with this one and I could not put it down  Each chapter is brilliantly written and will pull you into the next chapter  Just when I thought I knew who did the deed I was shifted to another suspect  I have been on a few trains in my life and when you read this book you will feel that you are sitting right next to the person  I have to give this one FIVE STARS  I will be looking for more to come from this great author    The Girl on the Train  is the fastest selling Adult Novel in history I just finished it recently   but let me tell you   it is Paula Hawkins  first book and an addictive  page turning thriller  not an easy book to put down It s also not an easy book to review without going into spoilers so I ll just say this much Its a fantastic thriller with shades of Hitchcock and a twisted ending  Even Stephen King has become a fan after reading the book Hawkins  writing is excellent  and it also felt like I was watching a movie   but in prose In fact Dreamworks Studios has already bought the rights to the book to make into a film  to be directed by Tate Taylor  The Help  and has already approached British actor Emily Blunt for the lead role  From Rebel AngelThis was another advance copy from NetGalley and will be available to buy on the 15th January  so make sure to remember that  or pre order it   if you like the sound of it I read the blurb for The Girl on the Train on NetGalley and clicked to request it as quickly as possible  Why  Because it was compared to Gone Girl and had been reviewed very positively by S  J  Watson  author of another of my favourites  Before I Go To Sleep  In the past I ve chosen books based on their apparent similarities to old favourites   sometimes I m disappointed  sometimes not  this time it was definitely a not disappointed The story is told from varying points of view  but our main character is Rachel   a woman who commutes daily on the train into London  watching the commuters around her and staring at the houses as she passes  There is one in particular that has always piqued her interest where the train stops at a signal every day  and the people that live there interest her even more  in fact she gives them names and imagines the perfect life they have  It isn t until one day when she sees something that turns this imaginary life on its head that we realise all is not as it seems  even  or perhaps especially  in Rachel s life  She feels it s her duty to report what she s seen to the police  but it only serves to make things worse for her  dragging her ex husband with his new wife and baby into the picture too There is of course the twist you always expect in a psychological thriller  and while it wasn t for me as huge as the likes of a Gillian Flynn novel  it was definitely still a good one  The characters in the book are fascinating because not one of them was particularly likable  and at different times you suspect them all of different things  And of course  it s one of those books you can t describe without giving anything away   so I ll try to be brief   this was a very good read  one of my favourites in a long time  and I d definitely recommend it  It isn t yet available for another week  but if you re interested  pre order it so you don t forget   The book was very enticing  I didn t want to stop reading  What a great mystery as well as a drama of what we sometimes think of other people  Even the ones closest to us can have totally opposite outlooks from what we believe  I thoroughly enjoyed this book  Gripping  Didn t want to put it down when I had to  yet wanted to put it down when I had time  I was so conflicted over the characters loving and hating them from one page to the next  One question tho    whatever happened to the red haired man from the train  Leest als een trein  brilliant  Thank you Paula Hawkins  got my mojo back Very different kind of read  Simple writing  not much derp character development  but a very active and engaging storytelling style  A mystery in a more Hitchcock style  Highly recommend  I ordered the book from Amazon and it came in the mail a few days ago  In the beginning chapters  I was confused on the characters however  the flow of the reading was intriguing  with great suspense  I loved hearing the Audio of the trailer  Excellent book  Now this is more like it  This thriller was indeed that and more  Just because I raced through this in one feverish afternoon and early evening does not mean that I skimmed the thing  Many times I had to go back and re read a passage  not because it was unclear or convoluted  but because the writing was so damned dazzling Rachel is a drunk  Her husband left her for another woman  Divorced  a friend has taken her in  She lost her job months ago when she insulted a client during an especially wine soaked lunch  but cannot bring herself to tell her flatmate  or truly face it herself  so she takes the train to and from London every day  as if she were still punching the clock  The train she rides goes past the house she shared with her ex husband  indeed  he lives there still with his new wife and their infant daughter  Rachel not only keeps an eye on them as the train trundles past but also on a couple a few doors down  concocting stories in her head about who they are and the charmed life she believes them to live  When the wife goes missing  she feels she knows enough about them to insinuate herself into the investigation   How much better life must have been for jealous drunks before emails and texts and mobile phones  before all this electronica and the traces it leaves  I will not spoil anything here  I feel strongly that it s worth going into more blind than not  I will say that Rachel s trajectory was fascinating and complex  with the queasiness and unreliable memory a couple of bottles of wine or several canned gin and tonics can bring A solid debut    a book set in another country loved this one  kept me busy trying to solve the mystery myself    of course I was wrong lol Amazing  nail biting page turner I couldn t put down for 4 days  I fell in love with poor  messed up Rachel and her inner thoughts and dreams  She s so human  so raw  so weakened by loss  you can t help but love her  And the supporting characters are all excellent  Wonderful writing  moving plot  and the ending was satisfying and spectacular  It read like an action movie  with plenty of lovely suspense  The first 50 pages go slow  so hang on  it get s really good as it moves on I enjoyed Hawkens writing immensely  she has a great way of storytelling with words that is both fanciful but somehow visceral and real  Great read  worth it  I could not put this book down  I couldn t wait to see what was going to happen next and every time I thought I had figured out what was going on  I was wrong  I ve heard this book compared to Gone Girl  but I disagree  Although it s hard to say that each character in this book is likable  I did find myself interested in each character at different times throughout this story I literally could not put this book down and found myself up too late at night reading it  NO SPOILERS BELOW I loved the hell out of THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN  I closed it and said  THAT was a fucking book   To myself  Out loud  The characters were so damn flawed and shady and had very honest  usually unspoken human thoughts  The structure initially had me nervous  but it ultimately paid off for me once I kept track of the dates  As far as super hyped thrillers go  I ll admit I loved GONE GIRL a little bit more  but I found both books equally addicting  ALSO  how insane is it that I get to put THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN on my 2015 Debut shelf  Pretty damn insane  I would like the film adaptation now  please   Page turner  Couldn t put it down  I put this book down and exhaled a big  Oy  that was good   I enjoyed Hawkins writing and the story was utterly absorbing  I thought I might get annoyed with Rachel s drinking and blacking out  but Hawkins painted her with such a subtle brush that I really felt for her  I wanted her to be okay  I wanted her to get it together  Hawkins managed to write all three women in the story so that their weaknesses and pathologies were relatable and engrossing  I had the hardest time with Anna  but Hawkins managed to walk the line  so that the ending was both believable and very  very satisfying to the reader  This is already a runaway hit   you cannot go wrong with this highly entertaining read  I read the      out of this book  Took me about 5 hours  Don t make the mistake of not reading it   kay  This author is a master at creating tension and suspense  I didn t really know what this book was about  well  I vaguely knew  Turned out to be a fun ride  and I m left wishing it was still going  I thought the the plot was brilliantly executed and the characters  while not necessarily likable  were quite compelling  I grew more and more sympathetic to the main character as the story went on  This is was a page turner from start to finish   It s been a long time since I completed a whole book in a weekend  but I simply couldn t put this book down  Needless to say  I really enjoyed it  I thought it was much more Rear Window than Gone Girl  At first Rachel s unreliability was a narrator was a little frustrating  but I don t think it took away from the suspense of the book  It also didn t bother me that all the characters were pretty hard to like because it made them all interesting suspects  From the beginning  with Rachel seeing the same people from the train every day and wondering about their their lives  it sucked me in  made me wonder about their back stories  and ruined my weekend productivity  I don t mind though  I thought it was a satisfying read and  as I mentioned before  it s been a long time since I literally could not put a book down  Sometimes that s a great way to spend a weekend  I m just a little sad the story  s over   The Girl on the TrainThis books was amazing  Every review I read about it was absolutely correct  I could not wait to find out who did it  Every time you think you know who did it  you question your decision  So many possibilities  If you liked Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn or Big Little Lies by Liane Moriarty you will definitely enjoy this great read Summary Three women  three men  connected through marriage or infidelity  Each is to blame for something  But only one is a killer in this nail biting  stealthy psychological thriller about human frailty and obsession   Just what goes on in the houses you pass by every day   Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and evening  rattling over the same junctions  flashing past the same townhouses The train stops at the same signal every day  and she sees the same couple  breakfasting on their roof terrace  Jason and Jess  as she calls them  seem so happy  Then one day Rachel sees someone new in their garden  Soon after  Rachel sees the woman she calls Jess on the news  Jess has disappeared   Through the ensuing police investigation  Rachel is drawn deeper into the lives of the couple she learns are really Megan and Scott Hipwell  As she befriends Scott  Rachel pieces together what really happened the day Megan disappeared  But when Megan s body is found  Rachel finds herself the chief suspect in the case  Plunged into a world of betrayals  secrets and deceptions  Rachel must confront the facts about her own past and her own failed marriage   A sinister and twisting story that will keep you guessing at every turn  The Girl on the Train is a high speed chase for the truth  Nothing more than what it claims to be  a thriller to keep you guessing   Great book  had me intrigued really early  couldn t put it down If you like a little mystery and some twists this is a good chic lit book for you Review on the blog    https   enchantingwolf wordpress com     I purchased this as an audiobook due to its popularity and hype  I felt the varied narratives were excellent and really aided the story  This book has been compared to  Before I go to Sleep  and  Gone Girl  both of which I read  I thought they were a load of rubbish  I was unsure whether to read it or not but I can gladly say that this book was far superior to the other two and I would not compare them in any way   This proved to be a really interesting story and I felt the author developed it well  The characters were well rounded and interesting  Yes the character of Rachel was very annoying and some of her actions beggars belief  It is patently obvious from the outset that there is more to the story  Although the plot plus the antagonist is easy to guess I still really enjoyed it  I felt that all loose ends were cleared up nicely at the end although I was sorry when it came  I would add my voice to those who recommend it  I eagerly await the next novel by this author   Suspenseful Suspenseful read  Didn t want to put it down  Good development of characters  Had to make a list of characters to keep them straight  This is a book I looked forward to reading when I went to bed  Lately  I ve had a hard time finding a book I could really get into  I rarely get past the first chapter anymore  but this book got to me  I write  and this is the way I want to write  It s not an easy read  but it s honest and I believed it  The three women telling the story speak honestly about the way they feel  They are not totally likeable  but that didn t stop me from investing myself in their narratives  The story is about a woman named Rachel  whose life is very small  She rides the train each day and as she passes houses near the tracks  she  adopts  a couple she sees at one house and creates a story for them  They are happy  in love  and perfect  Rachel drinks too much  is divorced  and the train also passes her former residence where her ex husband and his new wife and daughter live  The pain of that failed marriage has broken her  and the only thing that brings her up is thinking about the imaginary lives of the perfect couple  whom she has dubbed Jess and Jason  One day Jess disappears  sending Rachel into a tailspin  She had seen Jess in the back yard kissing another man  and since she cannot believe Jason could hurt his wife  Rachel begins to believe that the  other man  must have done something to her  The decisions she makes during this time are colored by the alcohol she consumes and can only lead to disaster  I kept wanting to lock her in a room so she couldn t do the things she was going to do  Rachel has also lost a chunk of time while drunk and can recall only bits and pieces of that time  She struggles to remember what happened  believing it may hold the key to what happened to  Jess   a woman she now knows was named Megan  The three women  Rachel  Megan  and Anna  the wife of Rachel s ex husband  narrate the story  giving us the action from each of their perspectives  I didn t see the end coming until I was near the end  and that doesn t happen very often  I gave it five stars because I did think it was amazing   I think I m into psychologically disturbed individuals lately  This one here did not come close to the last one I read but that one was on the extreme side of things When I first heard this book  I never thought it d be some sort of a thriller and that s because I did not bother to read the summary at the back  Well  I like to be surprised  And I was This book drove me nuts so as to putting off sleeping just to finish it  It s that good  for me at least  Made my brain hurt when the whole and true story unraveled but I did manage to get myself going again There s this one part where I literally gasped in the middle of the night and freaking looked around the room to check that I was alone  I ll give this book a go if I were you  So exciting  wow   I would have never guessed this ending  great book   Dear Paula Hawkins   There was a time back in high school and college where psycho thrillers  action suspense  and medical thrillers were my  thing   I fell in love with Mary Higgins Clark Sidney Sheldon  Robin Cook  Jeffery Deaver  et al  Thinking about it now  I can t seem to recall the time when I had decided to try something new until I unknowingly fall apart from the aforementioned genres  Cop out as it may sound but it really had nothing to do with the genre or the authors  it was all me  As a reader  I m like a sponge  I absorb  I think it is also a prerequisite for readers to have an active imagination and so I also have that thing going  I gave myself the longest possible break from thrillers until The Girl on the Train   I should be mad at you right now  or yesterday   the day the finished your book  for the mind boggling and mind fucking experience but I am not  The only thing I m mad about is that my pride is bruised  I had  it  figured out just a little over 70  of the book  For me  that took quite a little too long  That goes without saying then that you are a great master at what you re doing and there s no hint of doubt or whatsoever why your book was chosen as one of the best last year  2015   Instead of getting mad at you  I should thank you for bringing me back to one of my first loves  putting it like this doesn t sound right but whatever  Hah   I have to admit that it took me a while to finish your book because the first few chapters were quite a battle to me  Rachel s character initially came out too strong  oh the irony  and there might have been a little transference going on so I needed a breather  It was a good call  I tried my best to detach myself from the characters you have masterfully created and although I couldn t say I was winning all the time  I haved loved every page of The Girl on the Train  Realizations  Well I have plenty but I d just focus on one   Our weaknesses are not supposed to define us  No matter how many times we have been down at the bottom  barely able to get up and get going  No matter how many times we fail  it has become a vicious cycle    The highlight of this part of our life should be at the time we realize we still have the strength to put an end to something that feeds our weaknesses  In all of the Rachels we have in us  may we have a Cathy to help us push through  And Rachel was not the weakest to begin with  She was made to believe she was lacking and not worth it  So whatever you re going through right now  don t let someone make you believe you won t make it  Have faith in yourself  Because  You  Are  Fucking  Worth  It Your happy reader S      HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  Enjoyed this book  Plot slowly revealed  Would you ever look at other people lives the same way again  would you be able to trust anybody even your own personal version of past events anymore  Who is the culprit and who is the victim in this entangled web of lies  cheating and drunkenness  A true page turner  if you got nothing you can t help but finish it eat it all up in one sitting  The way she was capable of dissecting the characters inner feelings and expressing them out was amazed me  She was like examining each one of them under a powerful magnifying microscope reaching deep into their inner core  You would think that the book s structure narrating mostly characters inner thoughts might be boring but in this book there is not a boring second  it keeps you on edge till the end  The twist is just perfect  it will keep you guessing a good long time  Indeed it s depressing I presume it can touch most readers on a personal level  hurting deep proving how realistic and perfectly woven it is  Maybe the similarities with Gone Girl is the missing girl   the way of telling the story from different perspectives and the fact that you don t really know the truth of the people you share your life with  otherwise I don t see a comparison ground  I give it the full five stars in this thrillers category  other contemporary novels or non fiction memoirs could have more literature value compared to it  but in its category this book earns the full five stars   OMG  This was not marked  currently reading  for long  What a page turner  I can see why it gets compared to Gone Girl  I found my allegiances to characters going back and forth  It will make a better movie than Gone Girl  I m sure someone will make it into a movie  It certainly moves like a train  Sort of slow for the first few pages then it roars along heading straight for a brick wall  It s one of those books that makes you feel a little sad about society in general    Are we all just crazy broken in our own ways    but it s such a good story       This  Was  Awesome  I had heard comparisons to Gone Girl  which I loved  and I HATE comparisons because typically I wind up being very disappointed  This is totally different than GG  but has the same elements of suspense  done perfectly by my standards  Love the alternate points of view of the 3 women embroiled in the story and how they are weaved together  The premise is fantastic   alcoholic sitting on train fantasizes about her old married wonderful life and the lives of other happy people who have taken her place or just random strangers who appear happy  but are those people truly happy  What do you find inside the house  What I love is that I m a people watcher too  no  not in a creeper way   But I ve often sat and wondered about people  ok neighbors   are they really that happy  Is the guy standoffish for a reason  And of course  we ve ALL wondered about the  quiet guy who keeps to himself   note description of every serial killer I can think of   So I found the premise intriguing   simply looking out a train window and what do you see        I didn t care for Rachel  protag   at first  but grew to respect her more as the story continued  It was VERY realistic  I know MANY people burned badly in divorce usually due to infidelity and that  moving on  part is so difficult  UGH   that part was written incredibly well  The other 2 women   not as interesting  but I did like the suspense created by switching perspectives  One of my top books I ve read in a while  No doubt  Entertaining ReadI enjoyed the way the story unfolded over the course of the book  picking up pace and suspense like a quickening train bolting through a tunnel  The author toyed with me and kept me guessing like a great mystery  whodunnit  should do  It made it all the more satisfying when I solved the puzzle   So I decided to read this simply because it hit the best sellers list  I m not one to consume media simply because of popularity  if anything I avoid it  I like to consume based on its merits  the content  the story  the artwork itself  not the hype  I ve learned not to trust people  but rather trust the artist  But regardless of my disposition to the idea  I saw this book all over the place for a solid month or two  and when it came time to chose a new book  I chose this one  I knew NOTHING about it  other than the title  But it was a gamble  a toss of the dice of which I didn t know I had  Boy I m glad I tossed them The book was thrilling  depressing  dark and dreary  subtle  heart wrenching  This is the first story of any kind that I can honestly say that I disliked most every character in the story  usually to the point of hatred and screaming at the book itself  angry at the choices they made  Yet  with such disdain towards the characters through the book  I couldn t put it down  It was like the overused colloquialism of  like watching a train wreck   where it s horrible and appalling  but I couldn t stop consuming it  There was one main character  yes  but really it was almost three  and I disliked all three of them  I did  however  have at least pity for the main one  The Girl On The Train  This is by design  of course  But I get the feeling like I should have had some compassion for everyone in the story  but generally all I could feel was a sickening sense of distrust and the desire for vengeance for most of them  There were a couple plot twists that resembled cliche s more than that of a wolf in sheep s clothing  see what I did there    but it was easy to overlook when considering the overall structure seemed so chaotically real that inevitability was never an issue to retain within myself  I felt anger towards character for what they did  I felt anger for what was done to them  I felt  I screamed  and in the end I ended up yelling at each of the characters in this book my own frustrations to each of them  This may sound bad  but I look at it as a wonderful achievement The author crafted a story and characters that were real enough to push me into anger towards things and people that don t exist  and for that I say  bravo  If I don t have an emotional response at all  then I don t care  All I could do was care about this book  these characters  their filth and their humanity  all 6  of them  to a point where I couldn t stop reading until it was over Great book    Don t expect me to be sane  I can t be  not with you   And perhaps I have already said too much using this quote from  The Girl On The Train   The book you cannot put down  How often have you read that in a review  Well  this was it for me  The book I could not put down  I finished it last night at 11 45pm  almost in a daze  Diabolical plotting  Hitchcockian  suspenseful  full of trickery and malice and right up there with  Gone Girl   This book is a real chiller and I cannot say anything about the plot without giving too much away  The fact that I read it over a period of 24 hours speaks volumes  I cannot remember the last time I read a book that I could not put down     A page turner and psychological thrillerThis book is such a page turner I plunged through it in 3 days  The plot grabs me from the beginning  A woman narrating her observations and thoughts sitting on a train  Why is she so obsessed about the people living along the train tracks  Why is she making up stories of them  What is her story  My thoughts of each character evolves through the story  As I uncovered more of their lives  the characters take on additional dimensions  At the same time  the plot leads you through twists and turns  trying to play detective and unlock the puzzle behind all this  I highly recommend this book  It will keep you intrigued and involved   Original review on my blog here I thoroughly enjoyed this book  It was everything a mystery thriller should be and more  I thought that Hawkins  writing style really enhanced the book and brought the characters to life  I think the alternating POVs really helped with the mystery and the intrigue of the book  keeping the reader guessing and at the edge of their seat  In terms of who the culprit was  for once I actually got it wrong and I love that  Usually  I can pick up on the plot twist but when I get it wrong  it s the ultimate surprise an makes me love the book even more  The book was narrated in three different POVs  Rachel  Anna and Megan and throughout each perspective  we try to discover what really happened to Megan  Rachel rides the same train everyday and at a certain juncture on her train ride home  she gets glimpses of a couple s life who live in the house next to her old one  Through these glimpses  Rachel creates stories about the couple living in the home to the point where she has completely dreamed up a romantic fantasy that she wishes she had  Until  one day  Rachel s fantasy comes crashing down around her I thought that each of the three narrations were distinct and the characters were distinguishable from one another  The best part about this is that you absolutely cannot trust each of these girls  They aren t out to tell you the truth   they want to tell you their story  you know  Sometimes  telling your story means exaggerations  making things up on the fly and concealing the truth   and that is exactly what these three women do in each of their perspectives  And the way in which they are connected in each other lives is also quite delectable and juicy It s difficult to garner sympathy for characters who not only make terrible  terrible decisions  but it is because of these terrible decisions that makes you keep on reading  As I was reading  I couldn t even begin to tell you all my frustrations with Rachel  She just kept making the worst decisions and it was just like  how can you possibly do this  Out of all three characters  though  I think I connected the most with Rachel   and that might be due to the fact that she had a career in PR before she spiralled out of control  I  also like Rachel  like to create stories about the people around me if I observe them on a regular basis I thought the alternating perspective as well as the jumping timeline really enforced the thriller mystery aspects of the story  Not only did we get both the past and present from these women  but we had an unsteady timeline that forced you to keep track of when things were happening  And  if you were like me  you found this difficult to keep up with because you basically consumed the thing as fast as you possibly could  This book was also great in showing that as much as people think they tell the truth  often times they hide bits and pieces in only to enhance their projection of themselves to others  Definitely a wonderful character study and watching each character develop was great ALSO  the best part  The best part was that in trying to decipher who the culprit was I was completely and utterly wrong  You know I love that shit  right  Way to be mysterious  Hawkins  Wow  What an exciting read  If you like thrillers then this is a book for you  The story is told from the point of view of the three women involved and the author does a good job of getting inside their heads  None of the women are perfect  but I found them likeable  I cared what happened to them  Rachel seems to be on a path to self destruction when we meet her  when the disappearance of a girl she has watched from the train catches her attention and changes her life There were echoes of  Before I go to sleep  because Rachel has some memory loss  due it alcohol  and it is what happens during one of her memory loss episodes that is key to the mystery of the missing Jess Megan  I can also see why comparisons might be drawn to  Gone Girl  but I liked this better than gone girl  For me it is more straight forward than  Gone Girl  and I preferred the ending All in all a good read  This was an enjoyable read  I don t usually like mysteries  but I read Gone Girl  and I liked it a lot  so when the buzz about The Girl On the Train started buzzing  I hopped on board  Ha  A lot of people say its predictable  but it wasn t at all predictable to me  but again  I don t read these types of books usually  The writing was very easy and smooth  it was interesting  and not as graphic as Gone Girl  I definitely recommend for some light reading   There s no way to talk about The Girl on the Train without comparing it to Gone Girl  Both enjoyed the kind of buzz that leads to weeks atop The New York Times bestseller list and big movie deals  Both center on unreliable female narrators who make questionable life choices  Both take you on a chilling ride through sick  suburban marriages gone horribly awry Despite the similarities  The Girl on the Train is no copycat  It s a well written  cleverly crafted thriller  The titular girl is Rachel  an unemployed  alcoholic divorcee who enjoys living vicariously through the seemingly blissful  golden  couple she observes from her commuter train each day  Her illusions are suddenly shattered when the wife disappears  and Rachel witnesses an event that may be the key to solving a murder Like Gone Girl  the story will make you question the seemingly perfect lives of others  Through the first person narrations of three poignantly rendered female characters  Hawkins reveals how events  interactions  and relationships take on differing meanings to different people  how perspective shapes our actions  and how there s always much more to a person than meets the eye  Wildly addicting and ultimately unsettling  The Girl on the Train is the perfect solution to those Gone Girl withdrawals  Fabulously engaging read  couldn t put it down  Just when you think you ve got it all solved in your head another clue is revealed  Apparently it might be made into a film  and if it does it will probably be a ripper  I don t read murder mysteriesBut I kept hearing about this book  I really liked it  A lot  I like that it came from the point of view of the victim and the characters all who may have killed her  The main characterRachel got on my nerves be she Was so weak  But as the book unfolds you see the chinks in other characters armour and Rachel s weaknesses and issues are pale in comparison to others  Nobody is always what they seem  This kept me reading and guessing  close to the end I had pretty much figured it out  Looking back I wonder if  I should have gotten it earlier  That s fun reading  I was in suspense  Give it a read  You won t be disappointed  The epitome of a mystery  love the way this author writes  fabulous book  I hope they make a movie   I m speechless  that was a fantastic read   Let me real  Paula Hawkins  I hated this book until maybe 75  through  I hated everyone in it  Every character have me a migraine  I wanted to smack each and every one of them  However  that just means you succeeded in writing complex  flawed  and EXTREMELY f cked up characters  At the root of this book is a thrilling tale of how much we don t know the people in our lives  Also at the root of this book  Men are garbage  I knew this  and women can also be garbage  Humans can be garbage    But then there were twists and turns and a great novel that unfolded at the end  I can honestly see why people have this as a one star rating HAHA but I was won over in the end  From pages 300 until the end  not a lot of pages  she nailed the ending and made this reading journey worthwhile  But forreal  everyone was annoying and terrible but still turned out to be a great read     BRAVO PAULA HAWKINS  Couldn t put it down  Much like  Gone Girl   keeps you guessing and the characters are a bit despicable  The main character is a raging alcoholic  so although she is clearly the character with the most information  you can t believe a word she says  or thinks   Fascinating story  well written and had me guessing until the end   I couldn t put it down     Outstanding novel which takes you on a journey you could never imagine where it might end  Excellent character depictions and storyline    I m looking forward to reading another by this author immediately    Fantastic read    This was actually a GoodLISTEN  I feel a little as if I am cheating when I post LISTENS on here  but I want to keep track of the books I  consume  so I will keep doing it Listened to this during 16 hours of driving to and from Washington  DC this weekend  A PERFECT road trip book  And the three readers do    for the most  98   part   an excellent job  My one complaint    when Megan quotes Kamal  she turns the volume of her voice way down and mumbles   actually  mumbles  is too kind a word for it  I get that is trying to deepen her voice and adopt a bit of an accent  but couldn t someone in the recording booth have said   Could you try something else  my dear  Kinda losing you in these passages   I will not bore you with a full on review  Suffice to say    a twisty  turning  keeps you guessing  thriller that is the perfect mix of suspense  lightness  and mystery for eight hours of interstate driving on a busy summer weekend  I am VERY interested in how this gets  pulled off  as a movie  I don t think I know the work of the director who is doing this  director of THE HELP  but I think the bloke who did MEMENTO would be well suited   but maybe too well suited   Wow   Just wow read this book   WOW   what a book  I was lucky enough to get this book as a birthday present and I couldn t wait to settle down with it as I have read so many reviews about it  I thoroughly enjoyed it and managed to read it in less than two days  I do love a psychological thriller and this one did not disappoint it had everything you would want from a thriller  There were a few complex issues which I think Paula Hawkins has portrayed extremely well  Even though the book is set out with three of the characters Rachel  Megan and Anna  it is easy to understand and I literally couldn t put the book down as I wanted to find out what was going to happen next  This is a book that will keep you guessing and there is a twist at the end that you won t of seen coming till it hits you  A must read for this year  Amazing  I loved it  I also appreciate that the entire book is from the female perspective  However  I find it intriguing how much time these women devout to the desire for male attention  Their lives appear meaningless to them without the attention of some man  This book proved to me that you don t have to like the character of a novel to truly enjoy the plot  Great story  I raced through The Girl on the Train   an utterly compelling novel with one of the most infuriating female narrators I ve come across Rachel is an alcoholic  and her lack of control over herself and the events around her   her inability to stop and think clearly  her unreliable memory   infects the entire narrative with a queasiness and a sour sense of menace  She s at once sympathetic and maddening   but  unlike Maud in Elizabeth is Missing  Rachel is doing all this to herself  Or is she When the woman who lives a few doors down from her ex husband and his new wife goes missing   the woman Rachel sees as she passes on the train most mornings   Rachel knows she s seen something  and can t help inserting herself into the story  But is there something more to her obsession  And what really happened on that night that she can t remember Switching between the stories of Rachel  missing Megan and mistress turned wife Anna  the strands twist together and apart again  the truth remaining blurred   like the view from the train  like an alcoholic s fuzzy memories   until the very end  I d convinced myself that everyone was the murderer at some point or another  but it s a mark of the strength of Hawkins s writing that I wanted for Rachel to sort herself out and be ok almost as much as I wanted to know who the murderer was  A great read  Unreliable narration  steadily building tension  fantastic nail biter of an ending  WOOT  What a thrilling read  This one kept me guessing on whodunit well into the book  The book is written in the viewpoints of three women  Megan  Anna and Rachel  and initially hops back and forth from the present  to about 6 months prior  It is mainly Rachel s story and I did find Rachel very unlikable for a good portion of the book  She was a sloppy drunk who lost her husband  lost her job though she took the train every day pretending she was going to work and lived in a room in the home of a college friend  Her ex Tom has remarried  to Anna  the woman he was seeing while they were married and they have a child  They lived in the same house that Rachel and Tom lived in and every day on the train  she passes their house  She cannot seek to let go of Tom  she goes to their house repeatedly and calls over and over  never letting the humiliation change her decisions  Soon she notices another couple several doors down and she obsessively watches them and names them  And then one day  the wife disappears  Rachel spends most of her days in an alcoholic daze so when she has flashbacks or memories  is that what they are  Did she imagine events in her mind or did they really happen  And how will she prove it  She had lied over and over to the police to the point that they just think she s a lying drunk  She finds herself  under false pretences  winding her way into the life of the missing woman s husband which doesn t help anyone s story  I found myself towards the end struggling not to cheat and read the ending  I couldn t wait to fly through it to the end  Anyone who wants a gripping thriller  this is it  And it d make a fantastic movie  Check out this and many more reviews on my blog and follow me https   throwmeabook wordpress com 20   Rachel Watson  an unemployed and alcoholic

husband Tom Watson  where he now lives with his current wife Anna and their daughter Evie  A few houses down live Jess and Jason  whose real names are Megan and Scott Hipwell   one of the couples Rachel has created the perfect fantasy life for  When Rachel discovers Megan has disappeared  she manages to insinuate herself into the ongoing investigation and befriend Scott  Rachel soon discovers that the beautiful and put together Megan she created in her mind was far from that  hiding many ugly secrets  one secret in particular that could potentially destroy them all  After waiting almost three months on the holds list at my local library  I finally got my hands on a copy of The Girl on the Train  probably  if not definitely  one of the hottest and most popular reads of 2015  And what did I think of it   I LOVED IT  Damn you Paula Hawkins for writing such a thrilling novel  I was so engrossed in the story that my poor husband and children had to fend for themselves the two days it took me to rush through it The Girl on the Train is a masterful psychological thriller that definitely does not skimp on thrills  with twists and misdirection at every turn  taunting the reader  imploring you to keep reading  hungrily turning the pages on this enthralling  maddening rushing train ride  Truth be told  every single one of the characters of The Girl on the Train is a horrible  hateful  petty and deceitful person  hiding their secrets and obsessions under perfectly created masks  Paula Hawkins has taken her immeasurable talents for writing and storytelling to create them  but instead of deterring the reader  her prose just pulls us in with every sentence read  and making us want  need more than anything to discover these characters ultimate outcome Absolutely recommend to everyone  A movie adaptation of The Girl on the Train is already in the works  which isn t at all surprising  so read it preferably before the movie comes out because well  I always enjoy reading the book before watching its movie adaptation I give The Girl on the Train 4 5 5 stars   I finished reading The Girl on The Train by Paula Hawkins last night and wouldn t stop thinking about it  I had been postponing reading the book because the mystery seemed so sacred  I was afraid that once I finish the book and the mystery is over I will be left with an empty hole in my heart  Well  that happened but it also left me with a good feeling of having read such an exalting suspense and thriller after such a long time  I am not a sucker for detective or crime fiction but lately I have found myself drawn into it  I have read the Cormoron Strike novels by Robert Galbraith aka J  K  Rowling and now this The novels begins at a slower pace just like a train and once it grabs speed you can t just deboard it  I didn t realise when I got hooked onto the novel and I did an all nighter to finish it  Now I am left with a raw feeling as if something that I had planned to go one way  has gone another way  While reading you might make a list of suspects  you might guess what may have happened but when the truth is revealed you will be blown away The novel is written in first person and through the point of view of three different people  I am not disclosing the names   All the characters are sketched out beautifully  I felt that I knew the characters inside and out  Their insecurities  their fears  their weaknesses  everything has been dealt with and told to the reader The narration style is very different  something I haven t encountered in a long while  The stories sometimes run parallel and sometimes to and fro  One has to be careful with the dates to not get jumbled up  I kept going back to the dates because they are a vital part of the story  Paula Hawkins never strays in telling her story and you can not find a single loose end  There are different characters with different stories which all gradually merge into one The diversity of characters is something I loved  At points they seem similar  similar to the point of fault but they all turn out to be very different  There s an alcoholic  there s a possessive husband  there s a protective mother and there s a directionless woman  They all come loaded with their own pasts and issues which play an important part in the story  Read full review here   https   thebrokeninkpot wordpress com    Read for the 2015 Reading Challenge   10 A mystery or thriller  I completely enjoyed this thriller  Every single page of it  Paula Hawkins pulls you slowly into her story  I didn t even notice when I started to get so excited  I know the first chapters won t be exactly good for everybody because they have a lot of background story  but it worked for me  An excellent thriller about how deep we think we know people  how easy it is to believe in them  and how scared it is to not being able to believe in yourself A must for anyone who enjoys the genre   Expect a bunch of really twisted characters   really twisted   I feel like I m part of this mystery  I m connected  I am no longer just a girl on the train   Lo mejor que me he leido en lo que va del ano  sin duda  Intento recordar cuando fue la ultima vez que me lei un thriller psicologico y no lo recuerdo  Creo que en Agosto o Septiembre  Y es mi genero favorito  NO LO CREOEmpezare diciendo que este libro me engancho desde la primera pagina  Que la escritura de la autora es muy intensa sin necesidad de sobredramatismo  Y que la historia en conjunto esta muy bien pensada El libro empieza un poco lento  es cierto  pero no soso  hay una inmensa diferencia  Los primeros bastantitos capitulos son sobre los personajes  su pasado  su presente  sus suenos  su realidad  Pero esta contado de una forma tan ligera que nunca sientes el libro pesado  Realmente estas interesado en su vida   There s nothing so painful  so corrosive  as suspicion   Para cuando empiezan a suceder todos los twists ya conoces o crees conocer tan bien a todo mundo  que te olvidas de todo lo demas y te metes de lleno en la historia  NO CONFIES EN NADIE  EN NADIE    if you can t remember what you ve done  your mind just fills in all the blanks and you think the worst possible things     El personaje principal es Rachel  y lo mejor de tenerla a ella como principal es que ni ella ni tu puedes estar segura de lo que ha visto  Es una mujer tan danada por la vida y ella misma que duda de todo lo que pasa porque no puede creer en si misma  y eso va a darle un misterio muy padre a todo el libro  Megan y Anna son los otros personajes importantes  y a su manera las tres tienen todo un problema psicologico loquisimo  A nivel distinto  pero bastante notable mientras las lees  y para nada confiables  El ritmo del libro aumenta mientras avanza la historia pero nunca llega a un punto donde se sienta too much   El misterio se mantiene en perfectas condiciones y lo creepy llega de la manera menos esperada y mas inquietante de todas  Oh  lo facil que es ver lo que queremos ver  y lo todavia mas facil que es hacer que las demas personas vean lo que quieren ver  Creepy stuff    By the end of the day  everyone is going to know where they stand   Altamente recomendado para cualquier persona que disfrute este genero  no pueden dejar pasar este libro  rogando para que se haga una pelicula y sea tan buena como Gone Girl lo fue  Absolutely brilliant book  Great characters  interesting and suspenseful plot and fast pacing  I loved it If you hated Gone Girl like I did  you will like this  Characters are more multi dimensional  Yes they are a mess but you can feel sorry for them too  Not like Gone Girl where you think those 2 evil people just deserve each other  So good  Not as twisted as Gone Girl buy very suspenseful  Kept me on the edge of my seat till the end  A real page turner  Can t wait for the movie The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a cleverly plotted suspense thriller that I throughly enjoyed reading  This novel shadows some indomitably spirited characters that help pace this read from the beginning to the twisted end  The imagination that this author brings to this riveting novel at times is unnerving  as most will have a hard time putting this book down  If you enjoy nail biting  spine chilling pieces of works then this is an excellent book for you to choose  I couldn t stop reading  Loved it  When Rachel takes the train  sometimes she can glimpse a couple outside at their house  She fantasizes about who they are  what they re like  When one day she sees something amiss  she becomes entwined into their lives and a whole mess of lies and deceit begin to unravel and multiply Wow and whoa  I definitely felt influenced by the rave reviews to read this as it s been somewhat compared to  Gone Girl   That s not necessarily a bad thing  With shifting perspectives  the characters mainly unlikeable  I was still enthralled   I just finished The Girl on the Train  Wow  Amazing book  This reminds me of Gone Girl  This is a psychological thriller that starts with Rachel riding the Train as she does each morning and evening  She watches the homes and people as she goes about her daily train rides  She imagines their lives as she believes they are  When the wife of one of the people she watches disappears  she remembers seeing the woman with a man other than her husband  Unfortunately she is considered unstable and an alcoholic  But what will happen when she starts putting herself in the midst of the entire investigation  Again highly recommended  I can see this being the next Gone Girl  5 Stars definitely     I ve rarely read a book where I don t like any of the characters but really enjoyed the book  This is that book   DifferentI have heard many comparisons to Gone Girl  I have to say that I disagree  I do not mean that as a out down at all  I loved reading Gone Girl  loved this book as well  but I find them to be two different styles of writing  It is a greatly written story  filled with twists and unexpected discoveries  I enjoyed reading it very much  and will most certainly read from this author again  If you are looking for something differently twisted and entertaining  read The Girl On The Train   Holy crap  what a ride  Omg  this book was fantastic  Could not put it down  Please read it  A surprise from the beginning to  almost  the very end  this best selling  runaway novel s appeal lies in its pace and in the deranged point of view of its main character  A woman who no one ever wants to become  Rachel is a lonely  unemployed  raging alcoholic  who can t stop herself from stalking her ex husband while fantasizing about the lives of others that she observes on a daily basis from the window of her train car  Reminiscent of Hitchcock s  Rear Window   the author uses a similar device to thicken the plot as Rachel witnesses a possible clue to a murder from her vantage point  A classic enabler  Rachel gets herself enmeshed in a murder case that entwines her own dark past with the present  This book  often compared to Flynn s  Gone Girl   has a far more satisfying ending  I will never look at a corkscrew quite the same way again  Highly recommended   Great book  I read this book within a week  It reminds me of Gone Girl    potential spoilers Again  not my usual type of book  but I really enjoyed it  It was well written  the characters were fascinating and complex  and the story perfectly twisted and constructed  There were a lot of similarities between  The Girl on the Train  and  Gone Girl   which I had just read  but  The Girl on the Train  was by far much better written and developed One of my favorite parts of this book was the complexity of each of the characters  As the author uncovered the layers of the plot  I found myself loving each character as much as I hated them  which showed me how well formed they were  I also loved that the first half of the book was largely written as the diary of a woman on a train and slowly follows the main character to her home  through her quest  etc  In fact  I was on a train when I started the book and on a train when I finished it   La vida no es un parrafo y la muerte no es un parentesis  Una vez comence a leer las primeras paginas supe que me iba a encantar  y cuando estaba en las ultimas paginas me habia enganchado con cada uno de los personajes que no queria continuar leyendo por miedo a que se acabara tan pronto  pero aun asi la misma historia no me dejo otro remedio que seguir para no quedarme con esa angustia de saber que habia pasado  This book was SO damn good  What I fear most about thriller novels is the fact that sometimes they can be so bloody slow until the  reveal  moment comes  my main problem with gone girl   But with The Girl on the Train  it was different  The story was so fast paced that I didn t even had the pleasure to the close the book  i kept on reading it  In other words  it was so freaking addicting  The plot twist was a complete surprise to me  and Paula s writing style was speechless   Everyone is comparing this to Gone Girl but honestly  the writing is far better  This is a lot faster paced  more twisted  and more depth is given to the characters  Paula did an amazing job for this being her debut  Am I the only one who thought that the red haired man was going to be Mac  Excellent     Well written  great suspense  I m looking forward to reading other books by Hawkins Didn t someone once describe the television show   Seinfeld   as bad things happening to awful people  It could have been the subtitle for this book Having said that  this book was a joy from start to finish  The story was well told and while the characters    just about every single one    were reprehensible in their own way  each of them was unique  Their behaviors    within the framework of their odd world    were logical and believable A lot has been made of the unreliable narrator aspect of this book and it s there  but not in the way I would have expected  I read some people saying they saw the ending coming  Maybe I m dense  I ve been called worse  but I didn t  I had my suspicions eventually  but how the thing finally played out was surprising and masterful  No spoilers  but one word  corkscrew Bouncing between narrators is always dangerous but Paula Hawkins is a skillful writer and pulls it off  I can t believe it s her first novel  Can t wait to read more from this exceptional talent  I love the back and forth narratives between time people  These are the types of books that keep me reading  Once you understand the relationship between the characters  it all flows smoothly  This book was fantastic  I couldn t put it down and it kept me guessing throughout the entire book  Definitely recommend   I rank this one up there with Gone Girl  Super suspenseful and also a bit stressful  I loved it   dark sad and compellingNot only a good mystery but brilliant grasp on how we lie to ourselves  rationalize and cover the darker side of our human psyche  Stayed up till 4am to finish it   Mind blowing twist in the end  A book that wold keep you awake late at night just wanting to know what is going to happen next   Well  well  well    talk about a mind trip  This one is a definite mind trip  I am still thinking   WHAT  Rachel is one messed up chick  I mean messed up  Then there is Megan and Anna  I think in their own way they are all pretty much messed up  They have some serious issues to work through Rachel  sees something from the train on one of her commutes that leads to an exciting  and twisted turn of events  A girl goes missing  Rachel cannot let her ex go  and Anna wants to get rid of her husbands ex Rachel cannot seem to move past loosing her husband  She becomes an alcoholic  and instead of letting her room mate know she lost her job  she rides the commuter train every day at the same time  She stalks her ex husband and new wife relentlessly  She cannot seem to pull herself together  When she goes to the police with what she saw on the train  she is considered an unreliable witness because of her drinking Megan  we find out is not the sweet wife she seems to be  Rachel has nick named her and her husband Scott  Jess and Jason   She watches them each morning on her commute to the city  She imagines what might be going on behind closed doors  Of course there is far more to Megan s story  than just drinking tea and visiting with her husband on the back porch Anna  is Tom s new wife  and Tom  is Rachel s ex husband that she cannot seem to move past  There is always some kind of drama that Tom is saving Rachel from  and Anna just wants her gone The story gets very exciting when we come to realize that all three of these women have something in common that they don t even know I was totally surprised by this ending  I don t know why I am always surprised but I am  I do have to say that there are so many  bad  guys that this could have ended three different ways  and all would have probably been just as good When Rachel s memories start coming back to her  and things start coming together the book gets to a point where I could not put it down  It was so fantastic  This was exciting  twisted  and a little creepy  Makes me wonder who I am living next door to     Everyone seems to live such  normal  lives in this book  Until their worlds begin to collide with each other If you want a great  mess with your mind  exciting book to read  this one is right up there  It was so interesting to read  I love that it came from three different POV s  It made it that much more exciting to me  I loved seeing how it all came together   Good read  Not overly crazy twist but well written  Finished in a few days  Pretty hard to put down  I m always looking for a finish to a book that leaves you in complete awe  On a scale of 1 to 10 and 10 being the most ludicrous ending its about a 7  A little disappointed but that s probably just me  Not gonna say what character it was but he or she was to farfetched for me  However this was a very well written and entertaining book  If you have ever blacked out from drinking and know certain things from that night or think you do or maybe have a feeling that you know something bad or good happened  this book takes you down that road   For sheer entertainment  this is an excellent read  What an intense and unpredictable story British journalist Paula Hawkins tells through the first person accounts of Rachel  Megan  and Anna  Anyone commuting on trains may have made up stories of the lives of those dwelling in houses and apartments close to the tracks just as Rachel does  The author grabs the reader s attention as she explores such themes as loneliness and alcoholism  obsession  abuse  and isolation and holds it into the final pages   Very  very well written story  It slowly builds to an excellent climax  I really enjoyed it  There s a darned good reason this book is on the New York Times Bestseller List  Simply put  it is totally  utterly one of the most engrossing books I ve had the pleasure to read in a long while  It also was an Amazon Best Book of the Month for January 2015   no surprise there  either   and add me to the list of those who will be happy to see this one get all the honors it deserves To describe it as a psychological thriller probably really doesn t do it justice given the inner  and outer lapping lives of the six main characters  Where does one begin and another one start  Are any of them real  or are they just figments of one  or more  of the others  imaginations  After all  the book begins with Rachel on a commuter train   the same one she takes every day   stopping at one point at a row of houses in one of which she almost always sees a couple  she s named them Jess and Jason  doing  perfect couple  things on their perfect little deck  Until one day they don t  Rachel witnesses a scene that shocks her into reality  her version of it  at least  and she s compelled to call the police  From the outset  the story is told through the eyes of three of the main characters  Rachel  who once lived in this same row of houses with what she thought was a loving husband but now is occupied by her ex husband  his new wife and their baby  his current wife  Anna  and Megan   the  Jess  of Rachel s train ride imagination Then Megan turns up missing  and Rachel   who s more often drunk beyond the point of oblivion  has lost her job and is and still in love with her ex husband   desperately tries to retrieve long forgotten memories  if in fact they ever happened at all   The daily train ride quickly turns into a train wreck that s totally unavoidable  with readers being dragged along every mile of the way  And what a heck of a ride it is Ever the grammar vigilante  I m compelled to say that the substantial number of run on sentences really bugged me  although I admit that once I got half a dozen chapters into this one I really didn t give a damn anymore  And I also noticed that a job interview Rachel s landlady had arranged with a friend was mentioned quickly and then   even though it was pretty clear Rachel got drunk again and didn t make it   never was heard of again  Given the landlady s disgust with her tenant s alcohol abuse  I m pretty sure she d have been livid when she found out Rachel had blown yet another opportunity to improve her life  But you know what  I m still curious  but I really don t care about that  either  I leave you with this advice  If you have only one book to read this year  make it this one  Wow  If you haven t read this book yet    You need to stop whatever you are reading or doing and start it    This book is super fast paced from page 1   I don t think I have EVER been this addicted to a book in my life    I wanted to run to the restroom at work just to read the next chapter  but obviously I didn t   Is this the best book I have ever read  No of course not  it s not even close    but I had to give it 5 stars just because I couldn t put it down  None of the three narrators are likable or can be trusted but that doesn t take away from the intensity of the story   My only complaint is they could have added some more details to develop the storyline a little more  otherwise BRAVO     I really enjoyed this love crime mystery story  I was getting frustrated with the book and wanted to stop reading it because I was so confused with the characters  but something about this story kept me going back I couldn t wait to start reading it again because I wanted to know what was going on  This is one story that will keep your mind going excellent read The ending was a shocker   Well done  this book was hard to put down  The characters were developed so well that anyone of them was suspect   Review by www ireadnovels wordpress com It is unbelievable that this is Paula Hawkins first novel  What stands out about this clever story is how the author has told the story from all characters with an exceptional high impressive standard for suspense  I really think we are looking at one the new finest female thriller writers for the future  I absolutely adored every page  I would encourage any thriller fan to buy The Girl On The Train as it gives a good mix of characters each with a story to tell and not knowing who is telling the truth or lies  The story is about married Rachel who goes from being a drinker to being drunk that drove her husband away  Through black outs during her being drunk she can t remember if she said or have done terrible things  During her train ride to work she gazes out of the window when she starts to feel like she knows the people who live in one of the houses  Jess and Jason she calls them  One day on the train she something shocking  now she has her chance to become involved in Jess and Jason s lives  Chilling things happen  with a gut punching ending  A gripping thriller that revolved around alcoholism  domestic abuse and adultery  Worth the read   At first I wasn t sure where this book was going and if I was going to get into it  but I stuck with it and boy am I glad I did  This book was a great read that I could not put down   WOW  This was some book  I m tired of GONE GIRL comparisons  frankly  I found this to be a lot different  but the thrill and suspense is similar  I actually enjoyed it much more  Just when I thought I knew what was going on BAM    Everything changes Great book  This book was so fast paced and kept me on edge throughout the entire thing The characters were presented as being single minded to begin with and then all become multi faceted  I love how the author changes characters and perspectives throughout the story  This really keeps my mind reeling and second guessing everyone and everything  A thrilling  edge of your seat read  Told from multiple perspectives this book reminded me a lot of Gone Girl  Rachel is a mess  an alcoholic who has lost her marriage  friends  and job  She sees the other woman living what was supposed to be her life every day from the commuter train window  But she also sees the secrets people keep and this sucks her into a twisted love triangle that almost ends her life   I m torn how to rate this  If I feel a euphoria or a profound feeling  I rate it high  Upon finishing this I was just sad  I don t know if it is our narrator and her take on things or if the UK are assholes when it comes to alcoholics    but man  I felt bad reading this  It opened dark ugly places inside of me  It is so easy to make people dealing with addiction or mental illness  especially depression feel horrible about themselves and further perpetuate the illness situation addiction  Add to this that Rachel has gained weight  and the fat shaming  the idea that she is no longer a woman  no longer worthy of attention or love  is just really hard to read I can see where some people had trouble with the style of the book and just in general getting past the bummerness  official term there   But the bummerness and the heavy feeling the author managed to get from me is  as far as I can tell  great writing  She really knows how to portray addiction depression and the less than stellar reaction it elicits from people  It may have turned some readers off or made it hard to get into the book  but it was genuine and real The crux of the story is that something happened to Rachel but she can t remember it thanks to a drunken binge  She wakes up with injuries  a feeling of dread and half remembered images  something about fists  the taste of blood  a young man on the train who may have flirted with her or looked at her with disgust  she can t remember  Now there are three first person POV s  something I don t really like but it seems to be a new thing and I doubt we re going to get away from it at this stage  but Rachel felt like the main character  the one who is driving the story and the only one I had any sympathy for  Whatever happened to her happened on the same night that Megan went missing  Not only is Rachel an alcoholic but she has a slightly obsessive personality  the two often go hand in hand  and she can t get over her life with Tom  her ex husband  As a result  she takes a train that goes by her old house twice a day on her way to and from London  Just a couple doors down from her old place  she sees a beautiful young woman and her studly husband  She has an active imagination and gives them names and occupations and becomes slightly obsessed  When she finds out the woman from the house  Megan  has disappeared  Rachel has the feeling that whatever happened to her that night might be connected  there is a lot of anger and frank expression in this next paragraph  We also see things from Megan s point of view and Anna s   the woman  or homewrecker  who is now married to Tom  Rachel s ex husband  I wanted to punch Anna in her homewrecking face  Things are utter shit for Rachel  that is obvious  and this bitch can t understand what her responsibility is in this situation  She has no sympathy for Rachel  She also moved into her house a couple days after she moved out  I mean come on  She is constantly feeling superior to Rachel  just yuck  Now Megan is where the Gone Girl comparisons come in  We see things from her pov as well and learn she is not the person Rachel has imagined  But how could she be  Megan s relationship with her husband  and the husband himself  are nothing like the fantasies Rachel has imagined  What I didn t like about Megan s POV is that is seems like a diary   but it s not  That becomes apparent but I can t tell you how or why  Sorry  Spoilers  She had a really sad past and engaged in a lot of crazy behavior but I began to like her more and more as time went on The other part that was hard to read was how Rachel just kept digging herself deeper and deeper with lies and half truths as she gets involved in the Megan s case  First off  that bitch Anna told the cops she saw Rachel on the night of the disappearance  and that she is unstable and called them every night  yes  she calls Tom a lot  but not every night  and so Rachel is now raked over the coals by the cops about something that happened ages ago  She wants to tell them what she knows  but between the good cop and the bitchy cynical cop who smirks at her  she is labeled  unstable  and an unreliable witness  Even when she tells them that she saw Megan with another man from the train  But she doesn t stop there  She also reaches out to Scott  Megan s husband  believing that he  deserves to know   So now she is going to the same street where her ex husband lives  who she is quasi stalking  and involving herself in a missing persons case  She just looks pathetic  and the cops further pigeonhole her as a nutcase The plot was very tight   my reading time  per my kindle  was about 5 hours   and it never felt like it dragged  I could not figure out who was to blame   did Rachel do something  Scott  The guy on the train  What s his deal  It was so well done  I do want to pat myself on the back a little because I did see a dark little cloud over the perpetrator  but I was still not sure of everything and was very surprised at a few twists and turns  I definitely recommend this  Sometimes  reading a difficult book tells you something about yourself and teaches you stuff  and maybe even increases your sympathy or compassion for different groups of people  Or makes you realize that if some bitch steals my husband and starts making babies with him and wants to gloat about it  she best hope I m dead or in a vegetative state  I didn t read this book  I completely gulped it in one go  The characters are all so messed up  I liked the narrative but I was more interested in hearing more of Megan s side  I love how the story twists around the timeframe Rachel can t remember  I wouldn t say I was completely surprised  but it kept me guessing enough and besides I was way too interested in seeing the characters unfold  Best I can say is  I asked for a thriller and thrilled I was Spoiler I felt a little cheated by the blue dress though  I kept thinking of that possibility but then shrugged it off solely because of that only to have her change that detail in the end  This book got me on the edge  I ve never read a book so fast  This book was brilliant from start to finish  It took a while to get used to going back and forward between the different characters telling their stories  but I was hooked right from the first page  the writing is brilliant and really captures your attention  I couldn t put it down  it took me just over a day to read it  The characters were totally believable and I got quite drawn into Rachel s daily train trips to and from London  almost felt like I was taking the journey myself  The ending was totally unexpected and I was shocked when I realised who was actually responsible for the events that happened throughout the book  This book is well worth the 5 stars I ve given it  Definitely recommended  a fabulous read  This story is told by three narrators who identify themselves at the beginning of a chapter by just saying their name  The producer of the audio version has replicated these narrators by using three readers with distinct voices  That means  reading  it as an audio novel is probably not the best strategy  particularly as the time frame zig zags  with some narrators playing  catch up   so the reader is really never sure when events occurred  in relation to each other  With an audio novel you don t have the opportunity that a hard copy gives you of being able to flip back a few pages to check on a date or who is speaking  I suspect that if I had been reading a hard copy I might even have been tempted to write dates down and group events around them Add to that the fact that the principal narrator  Rachel  who is the  girl on the train   is an alcoholic and is frequently drunk  The police sum it up when they say that her evidence is unreliable  Rachel herself is the first to admit this because there are great holes in her memory  She has flashbacks in the form of dreams  and she is never sure whether they are things she has actually seen or whether it is her imagination at work  However as she begins to  dry out  bits of her memory returns  All she has to do is work out which memories to trust Rachel has lost her job in London because she came back from lunch drunk  having insulted one of her firm s biggest clients  She has been keeping up the pretence of going to work on the train so her flatmate will not know that she has no income  She desperately wants to be accepted by people  and to overcome her feelings of rejection by her ex husband  At night when she is drunk she tends to ring him in the middle of the night and even turns up at his house  where she also used to live  and frightens his new wife by taking their baby out of the bassinet  Just coincidentally their house is just a few doors down from the house where  Jess and Jason  live And then she sees something from the train which changes all their lives forever So it is a novel that really makes the reader work alongside Rachel at solving the mystery A number of reviewers have remarked on what a remarkable accomplishment the novel is  and I tend to agree  I have to list it among my best reads for this year  I read a lot of books and articles for my professional work  so do not allow myself personal reads very often  In preparation for such indulgences  I vet titles with the same research strategies as in my professional work  NPR MPR interviews with authors  NPR MPR reviews of new works  the weekly NYTimes book review  and of corse  GoodReads  That is how I arrived at purchasing The Girl on the Train  and what a rewarding read it was  I could have devoured it in one sitting  had I the time  but instead enjoyed every morsel of this suspense novel in those stolen moments for a chapter or two  Ms  Hawkins brought her award winning daytime drama writing to the page  often leaving us in suspense at the end of a chapter where what we supposed would happen  happened but with a twist that compelled us to read just one more chapter  As a debut novel for Ms  Hawkins  Girl on the Train not only demonstrates a finely crafted plot but also holds promise that we might look forward to many more good reads from this author  It s been a while since I picked up a book and read until I was bleary eyed  Fast paced and intense  Loved it   Definitely reminiscent of Gone Girl in style and plot  but still very enjoyable  Author does a fabulous job with characterization and voice  I was able to predict the ending about two thirds of the way through  but I still wanted to read to find out if I was right  Def recommend  This book was amazing despite from several people not liking it  but everyone has their own opinion  Besides the point  I think this book was absolutely positively amazing and I praise Paula for doing such a great job for her first thriller  Also  I loved how it showed Rachel  Anna  and Megan s point of view  It kept me on my feet every page  Once you thought you knew who the killer was it turned out to be wrong  I encourage anyone who loves a good thriller to read this book  I really hope this becomes a movie so I can see the characters in action like they was in my head while I was reading this wonderful book  Crazy  Train  That s what this is  Talk about making you constantly second guess what you THINK is going on   I could not put this book down  It was a part mystery and crime novel  I usually read historical fiction or award winning fiction and I usually don t like to read crime and mysteries  But the character development was done so well and although the characters were badly flawed you could understand what made them that way except for Tom  I wanted to know more about his upbringing  I thought it was interesting that the story was told by the 3 women involved with Tom  This was really a book that intrigued me and although it was upsetting to read and I was tense reading it  I couldn t wait to continue reading it  I would highly recommend it as a good read   Wow  I loved this book  The character Rachel had me yelling a lot  I loved the book Gone Girl  This kind of reminds me of that but its even better  I picked up this book because it was a Goodreads Best of 2015 selection  Goodreads was right  This book was fantastic The Girl on the Train chronicles the events surrounding a Very Bad Thing  told through three alternating  unreliable narrators  The voices were so distinct and powerful that after a while I felt like I knew them well enough to tell when they were lying to me  intentionally or because of a skewed world view   Looking back after finishing the book  I realized I was usually right  These characters were so fleshed out that I could read their tics even without faces The mystery aspect of it hit the perfect pace for me  I love it when I m putting the clues together one or two pages before the characters do  It makes me feel clever to have figured it out  but not impatient waiting for them to catch up with me  Reading this book  especially toward the end  I kept thinking   Oh my gosh  I think X is Y      OH MY GOSH  X  IS  Y  My single complaint with this book may be spoilery  so look away if you must  Even taking into account the unreliable narrators  one character seems to make a major personality shift toward the end of the book  Some of the things this character says and does practically cross into cartoonish  mustache stroking villainy  Even so  by this point I was so deeply enamored with this book that I didn t care This is a fun  engrossing read  Highly recommended  Amazing thriller   This book will make your mind and heart race   Otlichnaia kniga  Ia ne razgadada zlodeia  do momenta s telefonom   dumaiu eto ne spoiler   no na vsiakii sluchai skroiu I m so glad that I knew nothing about this novel when I started  Amazing thriller  Great pacing  If you liked _Gone Girl_  this novel is one to read this summer   Excellent psychological thriller Gritty  real  and raw portrayals of women  What a great book  Some compare to Gone Girl but only similarities are that main characters include a husband and ex wife and a missing woman  And the way each chapter is from a different character s perspective  Couldn t put it down   My favorite read so far this year  Loved it  Any fans of Gillian Flynn would also love this dark story  Rachel is an unemployed  divorced  overweight  alcoholic who takes the commuter train to London and back daily  Along the way she watches the same people from her window daily  particularly a young couple that she has developed an elaborate fantasy about  She has named them and has an intricate  imagined story about their lives and who they are  To her  they are the ideal couple One day  after a particularly heavy binge  she gets off the train at the stop near this young couple  She continues to drink and experiences a blackout  The next morning she awakes bloody  injured  and hung over  She soon learns that the woman she has been watching from the passenger train window has gone missing What ensues is one part The Hangover  only horrific rather than comedic  and Gone Girl  I completely understand the comparisons to Gillian Flynn and Alfred Hitchcock  This is exactly that type of story  at least for the first half I enjoyed this fresh feeling mystery  and I especially liked the character Rachel with her struggles with alcoholism and her inability to remember events that she felt she had been part of  I hadn t read such an intense book  ever  This was a very well executed drama and it kept me on the edge of my seat on several occasions  I d love to see this book turned into a movie  With the right writers  director and cast it could smash so much  Needless to say  I really loved the book  Such a good book  and the characters are so brutally  honestly  realistic  And it s incredibly written  and superbly structured  At first I was worried that the multiple narrators would get confusing  but it was done so well it was never a bother  All in all it s a really  really good book     up until the end  I was completely enraptured by it up until the mystery was resolved and I lost interest  It got a bit slow and drawn out in the last chapter or so  which was ridiculous right next to the consistently captivating beginning  But still  So good This is the level of brilliance I expected to find with Gone Girl  but didn t  I think The Girl on the Train is immeasurably better  Loved it  A Lot  I really enjoyed this book  It kept me guessing until the very last chapter  The characters were all a little  off   but that s part of what kept it interesting  Not to mention  this is a mystery about a missing person  so everyone is a suspect  I read a lot of reviews that compared this book to Gone Girl  I honestly do not see the similarity at all  The only similarity was that there was a girl missing  At first  I thought that I wasn t going to get into the story  but within the first 2 or 3 chapters  each chapter takes only about 3 minutes to read   I was hooked  I finished this book within 2 days  which is VERY fast for me  I usually drag them out for a few weeks  This book was literally a page turner  I couldn t put it down  I had to know what happened  Overall  it was VERY enjoyable  and I highly recommend it  OMG  Amazing    Wouuu    De los mejores libros que he leido  hubo un momento en el que pense que cualquiera pudo estar involucrado en la muerte de Megan  incluso las chicas en la historia  aunque era obvio que era un crimen sexual  al final me sorprendio como se desarrollaron las cosas  aunque desde cierto punto ya era obvio quien habia sido el asesino  Me gusto mucho la manera en que se escribieron los capitulos  aunque en muchas ocasiones me hubiera gustado tener un calendario conmigo para anotar los detalles importantes de la historia  ya que no seguian un hilo cronologico  y no queria perderme detalles valiosos para descifrar a los personajes Ame tambien que Anna no era precisamente la protagonista cliche  hermosa e interesante  sino que se trataba de una mujer mas ordinaria  era alcoholica  y de hecho  a la percepcion de algunos personajes era gorda y fea  Cosa que no pasara en la adaptacion para el cine  sera Emily Bunt  No me gusto mucho lo lento que transcurrian los primeros capitulos  fueron aburridos y no me enganchaban bastante con la historia  sin embargo  lo segui leyendo porque sabia que tenia excelentes comentarios y que pronto saldra la pelicula  y es imposible que no vaya a verla  asi que como siempre  preferi leerme el libro antes  The story begins slowly  innocuously  Rachel travels into London every day  and like many commuters  she passes her time on the train by looking out of the window  As the 8 04 to Euston trundles slowly past the houses which back onto the railway tracks  she gets a fleeting glimpse of their occupants  The train always stops at the same signal  and Rachel gets a perfect view of her favourite house  She can see the couple inside as they go about their everyday business  and in her boredom  she makes up stories about them and their sublimely happy relationship  She names them Jason and Jess  and they come to represent everything Rachel wants   everything she used to have   They re Tom and me  five years ago  We discover that Rachel has become something akin to Bridget Jones   if Helen Fielding s creation had taken a really dark turn  She drinks too much  She s put on weight and finds that men regard her with a mixture of contempt and pity  She makes nuisance calls to her ex husband   she s not being malicious  she just misses her old life  It all started going wrong when she couldn t get pregnant  and her husband had an affair   now the other woman is his new wife and they have an adorable baby daughter  It s not surprising that Rachel drinks herself into oblivion as often as possible in her rented single room   and now her alcoholism is also destroying her professional life  Meanwhile  we have a change in narrator  with alternate flashback chapters from one year earlier  voiced by  Jess   the woman living beside the railway tracks  In reality  her name is Megan and her life is far from the perfect idyll Rachel has imagined  Can her past confessions shed any light on the events of today  The story begins to deepen when Rachel spots  Jess  kissing another man  this evidence of trouble in paradise rocks her to the core  bringing back memories of her own ex husband s infidelity  Rachel knows how devastating affairs can be  should she somehow contact  Jason   who is actually named Scott  and tip him off about his wife s indiscretions  It s all rather too close to home   quite literally  as Rachel s old house is on the same street as Scott and Megan s  Her ex husband Tom has remained there  joined by his new wife Anna   who also contributes the odd chapter just so we can hear her side of the story Rachel decides to return to her old stomping ground to suss out what s going on with Scott and Megan    I just want to see him  I want to see them    what harm can it do     but it all goes horribly wrong  She wakes up with the hangover from hell and no memory of what happened on that fateful night   but Megan is now missing  Can Rachel piece everything together  or will she walk blindly into danger While many writers create effortlessly cool and sexy protagonists  no doubt with one eye on Angelina Jolie or Brad Pitt for the movie version  Paula Hawkins dares to make Rachel  well  not particularly likeable  She s a busybody  and her desperate desire to be involved with the action results in her spinning a web of lies which tightens around her as she gets pulled deeper into the murkiness surrounding Megan s disappearance  Often  thrillers lose credibility because the main characters have to be smart enough to solve crimes  yet just stupid enough to make the irrational decisions which will prolong the book  entering the dark alleyway with the stranger  hiding in a cupboard instead of calling the police etc   Paula Hawkins cleverly sidesteps this  Rachel s alcoholism provides a realistic reason for her to make unwise choices  such as drunkenly contacting people she shouldn t   and leads to her becoming more and more isolated as people shut her out of their lives  Rachel may be a frustrating narrator  with her erratic behaviour and dramatic lapses in memory  but we sympathise with her   While wishing she could get her act together and stop being so self destructive   The rest of the characters also have an admirable collection of flaws   Megan has a dark past  and her husband may not be such a strong and selfless protector  after all  Due to Rachel s stalkerish tendencies and harassment  we might have felt sorry for our third narrator  Anna  but then she admits that she liked being the other woman and doesn t care how it affected Rachel  In fact  all Anna cares about is protecting the secure little family unit she has created The book has been described as  Alfred Hitchcock for a new generation   and I agree  as well as a slow burning creepiness  it has that classic Hitchcockian theme of knowing that the police aren t going to listen and take you seriously  no matter how urgent your information  because they already have you down as crazy and delusional  I found the story perfectly paced  with new twists and turns coming from the most unexpected directions  If you re a binge reader who can finish a gripping novel in one breathless sitting  be warned  you re likely to end up reading under the covers at 3 am  and jumping out of your skin every time a floorboard creaks An extended version of this review originally appeared as a guest post at https   thebookselfblog wordpress com  The Girl on the Train is a psychological thriller that will keep you turning the pages until the end  It is told by three main characters Rachel  who drinks excessively to get through her life  Megan  who Rachel sees daily as she rides the train and is not the person that Rachel thinks she is and Anna  the woman who is married to Rachel s ex husband  The story is also told in different time periods which is initially a bit confusing but helps to give the back story of the characters  I initially wasn t going to read this book because of all the comparisons to a certain book from last year but I am so glad that I did  Once I started it  I couldn t put it down  It is well written and will keep you guessing almost to the end  A Great Read  Rachel likes to make up stories about the people she sees while riding the train to London every morning  But when her fantasies intersect with their real lives  things get out of control Devilishly wicked suspense in the vein of Liane Moriarty or Nicci French  I found myself running so many different scenarios in my head about the possible outcome  Great page turner    I literally read it in 24 hours  The use of different point of view  and not really trusting the protagonist really makes this a great book  Wow  this was really good  but it really messes with your head  You don t know what to think of anyone  and nothing is quite what it seems      When I started I was excited and wanted to get through it as fast as I can  I loved the way of telling the story  I enjoy hearing different perspectives on stories  therefore Paula Hawkin s way of telling this mystical drama through three women s eyes was great to read   Read my full review on my blog  just click here  Fun dark read  Had a difficult time putting down   4 5 5 stars for this gripping thriller  It seems as though everyone is comparing this book to Gone girl   I guess there are a few similarities but I liked this book more  It is more fast paced and edge of your seat reading and it kept me guessing all the way til the end  I had a few theories  none of them were right   I love it when a thriller keeps you guessing like that  In my opinion it is a must read   That was incredible I started the book a bit reluctantly and without any further knowledge of plot or characters  And the first three or four chapters felt utterly depressing  really well written  but utterly depressing  I stopped reading after that  and picked up the book the next day  And I read the whole thing in a sitting  Because honestly  once you start  how are you gonna put it down until you figure out what the hell is going on The different perspectives  the detective story that is told by a different voice and not the traditional detective one  everything was on point and I loved every second of it  I mean  it is a mystery plot after all  and as I have previously mentioned I have read a loooot of those  Which means that I figured out who the killer was way before the reader is supposed to  and at the end the who did it was exactly as I had played it in my head   which is what I like about Rowling s Rebus  the way in which she makes me not know what to expect  But anyway although I did see the bad person and the bad deed coming from a mile  the ending was astounding and unpredicted  and it played out succesfully enough for me to forget the predictable nature of the mystery and be happy that I decided to pick up this book in the first place  It s amazing in every single way  This is not a book you relax with  The buildup starts at the first page and doesn t let up until the last  The characters are completely insane and will attempt to drive you insane figuring out what  if anything  happened and how Rachel s vision from the train affects their lives  You re in for a treat when you pick up this book   Tek sey soyleyebilirim  kesinlikle HARIKAYDI  Kitabi cikar cikmaz alan bir suru kisi oldu ve cogu da begenmediklerini soyledi  Kitabi ben almadim  bir arkadasim odunc verdi  Her ne kadar ilk ciktigi anda hunharca almak istesem de kendime yasak koydugum icin alamamistim   Best book of 2015  It has been a long time since I have read a book that I had a hard time putting down  And after having to grudgingly putting it down it stayed in my thoughts  I am looking forward to reading more from this author  If you are a fan of Gone Girl   what are you waiting for  WOW WOW WOW I loved this book  Something about a bunch of terrible people being terrible that really gets me going Review to come  I couldn t put it down   The Girl on the Train has been compared by many as being similar to Gone Girl  I read Gone Girl over two years ago  and I still remember it as being a tightly crafted novel  The memory is probably fresher because I saw the movie   I liked Ben Affleck more in Argo  But what makes the novels similar  They are both told by more than one voice  more than one Point of View  Usually we can trust the voice of the narrator  but in both of these we have an unreliable narrator or two or three  We have liars and alcoholics prone to blackout  In both we have some pathetic characters   Can they get a life  I liked The Girl on the Train more because there was more positive character development at least in the case of Rachel  the girl on the train  I found the character development of Amy in Gone Girl to be creepy  Not someone I would want to be in the same room with I gave Gone Girl four stars because in spite of the well crafted story  the ending was unsatisfying  I have to give Girl on the Train five stars for closure  Holy WOW    This book was amazing    I couldn t put it down and now I m sad it s over  Read it in a day  Couldn t take the suspense    The book is definitely a thriller and was hard to put down  The story is told from three points of view  Rachel s   the girl on the train   Anna s and Megan s  Rachel rides the train to London each weekday  One of the stops is right by the house where she used to live  The house is occupied by her exhusband Tom and his new wife Anna  Just a few doors away Rachel observes a happy couple  obviously very much in love  In her imagination she builds a whole story about them and yearns for the time when she and Tom were happily married  Then the wife Megan is missing  Rachel has seen something shocking  but she can t quite remember what it was  She sometimes has blackouts due to her uncontrolled drinking Is there a way to recover her memory of the night Megan went missing None of the people in this story were particularly likeable  Rachel is an alcoholic and annoyingly clingy  Anna is self centered  egotistical and totally involved in her own world  and Megan lacks moral integrity and loyalty  However  as the story unfolds we begin to understand why two of these women behave the way they do and that nothing is the way it appears  We can look at other people s lives and think they have a perfect life  but life is not perfect  Everyone has flaws and struggles to find who they really are  Each deals with tragedy and disappointment differently  I loved the story  and the way the author made the reader think at different times that the killer was some one different  Great read  Poor Rachel  Her husband has left her for a younger  thinner  prettier  blonder woman  A drinking problem surfaces before the divorce  and spirals into true alcoholism  impacting all aspects of her life  She rents a room from an old friend  and loses her job  Even though she has nowhere to go  she gets on the train every morning and goes into London  so that her friend landlord does not find out she is unemployed  She watches the world go by and fantasizes about the couples and families that live in the homes she passes each day  One couple in particular interests her  She sees them out on their terrace frequently  Obviously very much in love  Their home just down the street from where Rachel lived with her ex husband  and where he now lives with his new wife and baby One day  on her train ride into the city  there s a change  something very wrong  and Rachel is intent on finding out what happened I enjoyed the book and found it very suspenseful and hard to put down  I didn t expect the ending  This book started out a little slowly for me  but I m glad I stuck with it because it became an edge of my seat can t put down page turner  If you want a mystery thriller that is a little out of the ordinary  you won t be disappointed with this one  If you enjoyed Gillian Flynn s writing you will love this  Lots of other comments say that they are tired of hearing to novel compared to Gone Girl  Granted  there are some slight similarities  the point I want to get across about this novel is that the writing is really dark and out of left field  just like Gone Girl  I had absolutely no idea how the novel would end up until literally the last 10 pages or so  The novel is a quick moving story  lots of plot twists and a whole mess of misunderstandings and lies  I don t want to spoil anything so I ll just need everyone to trust me when I say READ THIS BOOK  Stop what you are doing  shirk work  stay in on Saturday night and fall deep into this book  You will not be disappointed  I liked this book very much and admired the masterful plotting of themystery  I could really get into the head of the heroine as she struggled through her issues  Good job  It s not often that a book lives up to its publisher s hype  but this one certainly did  I found it hard to put my finger on why this felt quite  different  to other crime fiction thrillers  The story is told from the perspective of three different female characters   that s unusual  The women originally appear only very loosely linked  but as time progresses  we find their stories on a horrific collision path  It s essentially a crime story  but the police and the official investigations are only minor characters in the story  The plot twists are intriguing and  for me  unexpected  The female characters are very easy to relate to  and empathise with  Probably can t say more without spoilers  but it s highly compulsive reading  Strongly recommended  A great thriller  page turner  couldnt put it down  Kept me guessing up until the end   Liked  all the characters  Also liked the way the book was written in the voices of the 3 women   This was a real page turner  I stayed up way too late and kept thinking about it even after the light was out  Paula Hawkins s melancholy tell of what happens to the survivor s of murder victims as they go on living in the aftermath of loss  with their own pathologies and pathos  shines as a hypnotic and nimble new comer in a genre burdened down with rigid rehashing of the procedural tropes in many mystery thrillers  The story starts with Rachel piecing her life back together after being fired from her job  She is living with her flat mate Cathy  pretending to still be employed by riding the train into town each day  and generally snooping in the lives of her neighbors  imagining their specifics and superimposing her wishes on couples in her local park She s a lonely  self loathing alcoholic  approaching the hill s bend who may or may not have murdered a familiar woman in a blackout fit of rage  She keeps reaching into the missing spaces in her memories for those lost hours in hopes of discovering just what happened to the pretty blonde reported by the local press as missing Along the way Rachel makes more than her fair share of missteps like attracting police attention toward her as a potential suspect when she really meant to aid the investigation  to identifying the wrong man as the murderer  causing his life undue pain  and even becoming friends with the victim s husband  which blows up in her face when he confronts her about her lies The characterizations are spot on  Thirty somethings  self involved and reflecting on their experiences to find meaning in their identities and daily lives  Enter Rachel the character with the story s biggest narrative perspective  filled with angst and despairing after being fired for an alcohol fueled emotional breakdown at work  She looks for meaning in the lives of others and hopes to find someone to love her chubby body and crows feet ridden face Meagan  the hot blond that everyman wants and every woman wants to be  is in similar shape  Her beauty is better  but her loneliness and longing are equally as strong as Rachel s  The beautiful thing about Hawkins writing is she portrays these ladies desperate situations with striking visceral ness  Their thoughts  feelings and perspective lunge from the page and right into your mind as the pieces of a real experience  though virtually distributed through the medium of the novel  In short these ladies breathe and live on and off the page I would find myself feeling like   Poor pretty Meagan  so sad   not knowing that I d feel less connection to her after I learned what she d done to motivate her potential murderer  The roles were reversed for Rachel the books protagonist  I thought her quite unappealing at first when I thought she was a depressed and aging alcoholic  But when I discovered that she had several psychological pathologies  I loved her the way I love traffic pile ups across the median  Memories and how they fade over time is the biggest thematic concept discussed in the pages of The Girl On The Train  From Rachel s pure blackout  to Meagan s more nuanced memories of darker days locked within the vault of her lonely feelings we get a cobbled together view of the past life events that motivate the characters  current actions  Rachel s cognition issues come from her drunken blackouts that leave holes in her memories  Meagan and Scott  her husband are both driven by faulty memories  either romanticized through distance from the events that inspired them  or due to constant rehearsal that glosses over the truest features from the past  respectively Loss and how we as people deal with it plays huge in the themes category as well  Rachel as the barren mother turned alcoholic tries to fill the void in her life by helping Scott find his missing piece  just who murdered his wife  But she had in turn lost her dream of being a mother when it was discovered her womb was barren  Scott lost his wife Meagan to the hands of an illusive murderer  Meagan  before dying had lost her way in life due to the deaths of two key people from her past and her resulting disillusionment that sees her seeking to fill that void by cheating on her husband to prove to herself that she is desirable lovable to men  Rachel s pathological lying and constant meddling are attributes I loath to see in people I know  but on a character as nuanced and just plain crazy as Rachel  they are the life and breath of this narrative  which plays in the  what about the people who knew the victim  realm And that is the fresh air that Hawkins brings to the genre  Every detective mystery I ve read or even watched in movie theaters shows the detective s perspective  or the victims  you know through flash backs  This one discusses what happens to those waiting to hear that the police have captured the slayer of their wife  neighbor  or the girl the protagonist obsessed over as they road the train to town  Rachel  as an OCD nightmare stalker private investigator sizzles as an unexpected suspense novel star who is an unreliable narrator and gets as close as law enforcement would to solving the murder when using their tactics  The author mingles a bit of the lead character s own paranoia and pathological nosiness into her sincere attempts at exposing the murderer  thereby exonerating herself from the memory gap she has of the night in question  How emotive  cerebral and delicate this thriller truly is  From wondering if Rachel is the blackout killer  to the red herring of Dr  Adbic as the wanted murder  and then back to wondering if Rachel has actually killed Meagan again  I totally bought the slight of hand that author  Hawkins does right before my very eyes  A novelist as skilled at misdirection as she  would definitely make a great up close street magician  And that s what the first half of this novel plays out as  A card trick of a tome that kept me wondering who done it  while all road lead to the sketchy protagonist in the genre specific trope of the detective did it  but doesn t remember  this time the detective is a blackout drunk with self esteem issues and a histrionics complex to boot  Read this dazzling New York Times Best Seller and recommend it to all your friends   Just finished  The Girl on The Train  If you have a hard time with multiple narrators  I recommend listening to the audio book  That being said HO  LY  FUH UHCK  I did not see that coming  It did all the things a fantastic novel should do for me  1  Made me forget about my student loan debt  2  Made it impossible to put down  in my case  since I was driving and listening to the audio book  press pause  3  Left me with that empty feeling you get after you finish a book  Everyone  RAVED  about Gone Girl   gags    Bitches  please  This knocks Gone Girl out of the water  and has characters you love to hate  as opposed to Gone Girl  where I wanted to hold them all under until the bubbles stopped   It s as if the females from The Awakening  The Yellow Wallpaper  A Doll s House  and Gaslight all had a love child and instead of meeting her untimely end  grew some balls and stuck it to the man  Literally  While I will not give a way spoilers  I literally let out an   ATTA GIRL   and a fist pump when I heard the ending   Other drivers saw and probably judged me  Kimberly   now you know what I thought  I FUCKING LOVED IT  wow  Just wow  I won t say anything more because any statement is a spoiler  Don t read reviews  Try to ignore the hype  Avoid reading the blurb if you can  Just read this fresh with no expectations and enjoy a good read Un libro realmente interesante que merece una oportunidad Rachel es una mujer con muchos problemas pero  desde mi punto de vista  entendibles  Su ex marido no ha sido la persona mas sincera del mundo  ni que decir de la nueva esposa  la cual era la amante y  la verdad  creo que esta mas loca que Rachel Debo confesar que no vi venir ese cambio de personaje  o culpable   imagine que la culpa era de otro hasta que Hawkins decidio dar un giro y me cambio el chip Me gusta la descripcion de los personajes  muy entendible la personalidad de cada uno de ellos  ademas  todos son necesarios para llegar a la conclusion de la historia En fin  la historia me impacto  muy entretenido  En partes me hizo recordar a Gone Girl y a la saga de Millennium  Los hombres que no amaban a las mujeres   y creo que por eso me gusto mucho  ya que este ultimo es de mis libros favoritos de siempre Definitivamente  una buena lectura  This story was really vivacious and had some nice plottwists in it  There will be a review on it tomorrow on le blog   Loved every single page of this book  Terrific   Quick read  A little over halfway was when I could not put it down  It kept me on my toes and I captured all sorts of emotions for me   Titel  Am Rande der Gleise   Irgendwie war das Buch dauernd prasent und je mehr ich daruber horte  desto neugieriger wurde ich  weshalb ich es dann auch unbedingt lesen musste  Und meine recht hohen Erwartungen wurden ubertroffen Rachel fahrt jeden Tag mit dem Zug zur Arbeit  Jeden Tag halt er an einer ganz bestimmten Stelle und wartet auf Weiterfahrt  An genau dieser Stelle beobachtet sie ein Parchen  das so glucklich scheint wie sie gerne ware  Doch sind diese beiden Menschen wirklich so glucklich Die Handlung wird uns aus der Ich  Perspektive naher gebracht  jedoch nehmen diese Erzahlperspektive drei unterschiedliche Frauen ein  Den Grossteil erleben wir gemeinsam mit Rachel  aber auch Megan und Anna kommen zu Wort Das Besondere an dem Roman ist wohl  dass die ganze Zeit unterschwellig Spannung vorhanden ist  aber eben sehr gemachlich und im Hintergrund Das Hauptaugenmerk liegt hierbei auf Rachel  die ihr Leben leider so gar nicht mehr im Griff hat  Sie trinkt seit ihrer Scheidung und versucht ihre Probleme zu verstecken  Man bekommt durch sie ein genaues Bild von einem alkoholabhangigen Menschen  was ich als immens spannend empfand Durch die gewahlte Erzahlperspektive erfahren wir sehr viel uber die recht unterschiedlichen Frauen  die doch mehr gemeinsam haben als man auf den ersten Blick erkennt Je mehr man als Leser dem Geheimnis naher kommt  desto suchtiger wird man nach der Schreibe der Autorin Frau Hawkins hat einen sehr ernuchternden Erzahlstil  aber gerade das lasst Rachel und Co so authentisch wirken Das Ende hat mich so dermassen uberrumpelt  dass ich auf den letzten Seiten mehrfach schlucken musste und den Mund beim Lesen kaum noch zu bekam Fur mich zu Recht ein Buch  das in aller Munde ist  Wer es noch nicht gelesen hat  der sollte sich fix auf Reisen begeben mit Rachel und Co und lernen  dass nichts ist wie es auf den ersten Blick erscheint Fazit  Uberraschend spannend und absolut unvorhersehbar  Ich kann nur eine klare Leseempfehlung aussprechen  What a great book  From the beginning you feel for the main character  Rachel  which leads to sorrow  disgust  and  what was she thinking    moments  As the rest of the characters  which are not in any place to cast the first stone  are introduced and as you follow their stories  you are constantly trying to figure out how their stories all tie together in the end  I thought I had it figured out  but slowly those ideas where chipped away until the realization of the truth caught up with me  It was awesome  Loved every page but impossible to put down   I am very much against spoilers so I cannot reveal too much about the various twists in the plot of The Girl on the Train but I can assure you that there are twists a plenty  The Girl on the Train is a gripping read   you must avoid spoilers  you must read it as soon as you can and you must hope that someone makes it into film so that you can tell them you read the book first and that it was incredible Extract from my full review which appears at http   grabthisbook net  p 300 The Girl on a Train is a murder mystery  and perhaps a psychological thriller  about an alcoholic woman who suspects foul play between a couple she spies while riding on a train  The chapters alternate between three different points of view  Rachel  the woman on the train  Anna  the new wife of Rachel s ex  and Megan  the woman Rachel sees from the train  The alternating POVs helps build the suspense throughout the book but I occasionally was confused by who  I  and  she  were in the narrative  This confusion was compounded by the fact that the author purposely made those terms ambiguous to increase the suspense The character and setting descriptions are outstanding  The sometimes long narratives helped build the tension and heightened the sense of impending danger  Rachel is an alcoholic who just can t stay sober  Consequently  she is an unreliable witness and she makes sometimes incredibly bad choices  The bad choices border on the unbelievable which is the fine line fiction authors must walk in order to write compelling stories  Rachel reminds me of Whip Whitfield  the alcoholic pilot  played by Denzel Washington  in the movie  Flight  Rachel and Whip can t help themselves   their addictions to alcohol are just too strong and they just keep on drinking to the detriment of their well being and survival  Have you ever found yourself passing by the same houses while traveling to and from a regular destination  Have you ever wondered who lived there  what they do and what happens beyond those curtained windows  Doubtless you would give it much thought once you passed by  but    what if you took that curiosity further   Paula Hawkins  debut novel  The Girl on the Train  takes you down that rabbit hole   It s filled with perfect combination of intrigue  dysfunction  deception  desperation  and just the right amount of blood from of unknown origin   TGOTT was a novel I couldn t put down and hampered my ability to get forty winks   If you re looking for that rare book that keeps you wanting more  I highly recommend that you get your hands on a copy of  The Girl on the Train  Blinded by Love and LiesWhat an excellent read  This book takes you on a ride of your life and at the end of this book it leave you speechless because you never saw it coming  You never know what people are capable of doing when their backs against the wall   Loved this thriller  I didn t see what was coming until the very end  I guess that s what makes it a quick page turner  None of the characters have redeeming qualities which made it hard to want to root for them  but I still wanted to know the truth so I stuck with their obnoxious characteristics  It felt like the perfect case of he said she said  which after a while I do admit I wanted he and she to both shut the heck up  but I think Hawkins employed this method to keep the plot under wraps long as possible also dragging the reader along with just enough tidbits to keep us interested  This was so exciting the whole way through  I didn t want to put the book down  I enjoyed creating stories in my head for each character and why how he she could have done it  This is an intriguing rear window type of tale  As told from an unreliable narrator on a train  I felt it was a little slow in the middle  But definitely picked up and surprised me  Now I know why  everyone  has read it Ok  so does the fact that I set my alarm this am to finish the book say anything  This book will definitely appeal to fans of Gone Girl Not as deranged or dramatic but a slow burn that sneaks up on you   The story is set in Britain where the alcoholic girl on the train  Rachel  witnesses something which she thinks is a clue to a woman s disappearance  However  wrapped and twisted around this is her ex  husband his new wife  and the missing girl s husband  It is told from the point of view of these three women with Rachel being the dominant force  The characters are well drawn  with the author handling the transitions between narrators  superbly  With excruciating tension  this is THE book to read   I read this book today  From beginning to end I could not put it down  I highly recommend it if you want a suspenseful read although I predicted the main plot halfway through  it still kept me guessing at a majority of the time    Just what goes on in the houses you pass by every day      PublisherMrachnovataia  mestami nudnovata  no intereeesnaia     Vtselom

perfect for fans of GONE GIRL  I had no idea who had done what until the very very end and I loved the writing style of different narrators and time jumps  It really kept me wondering  At times  I had to set it aside because it was so grim frustrating dark  but then I snatched it back up because I just had to keep reading  Highly recommend   Wow  Just wow  I purchased this book after my little sister said she wanted to read it and I am so glad I did  I raced through this book and stayed up way past my bedtime to finish the last few chapters because I had to know what happened  The Girl on the Train is told from the perspective of three female characters  Rachel  whose life is in shambles and who rides the commuter train day after day past the town she once lived in  Meghan  who currently lives in Rachel s old town  in a house down the street from Rachel s old house  and Anna  who currently resides in Rachel s old residence  The story centers around a murder and discovering who did it becomes so twisty that you are guessing up until the end 5 big snaps for me  This novel is a real page turner  It s a complicated character study mystery that reminded me a bit of  Gone Girl  in mood and tone I seldom read mysteries  so I found this novel refreshing  I won t say much about the plot except that it involves three young women whose lives are intertwined  The primary narrator is an unreliable alcoholic young woman  Rachel  who rides a commuter train from the burbs to London every day  She fantasizes about a young couple whom she observes in a voyeuristic way from the train window on a nearly daily basis  Soon enough  the fantasy woman is reported missing on the same evening that Rachel was wandering the area in a drunken stupor  unable to recall what happened that evening as she has suffered one of her frequent black outs after binge drinking  Suffice it to say that the plot involves her ex husband and his new young wife and baby and the volatile husband of the missing woman  The novel kept me guessing until I had reached the  70   read point  on my Kindle  I really was uncertain as to who the murderer was  but began to figure it out at this point I found the book to be nearly flawless in structure and to be well written  Good reading   good writing  I was into this book from the very beginning and all the way through  I would definitely read her next book if she were to write another  An awesome read    I m so sad that this book is over  I loved every minute of it  I think the readers were excellent in bringing the story to life  I really felt as if I were watching a movie of some sort  We follow three different women from past and present  Rachel  Anna  and Meg  All three of these women are connected in some way or another  This is mainly Rachel s story though and her character drew me in from the very beginning  See  Rachel is a drunk  an alcoholic  She s also clinging to her ex husband and his new family that he had left her for when it was clear that Rachel was unstable  Throughout the book we are told that Rachel has witnessed something terrible but she doesn t remember anything because she was so shit faced drunk  It s pretty sad  When Meg turns up missing on the night that Rachel blacked out  everything is all down hill from there  Every single character seems guilty and you don t know who to trust  That was the beauty of it until the very end  And your left thinking well duh  how did I not guess   If you re looking for a thrill and mystery  look no further  A gripping suspense from an unreliable narrator that keeps you guessing from cover to cover  Hawkins did a masterful job at keeping this story fast paced and the mood dark and ominous  I love to figure out the ending and while I had it pegged about 2 3rds of the way through  there was still enough suspense to figure out how it happened and why to more than hold my attention  I especially liked the variety of female viewpoints from the narrator to the ex wife and the dead woman  If you liked Gone Girl  this is the book for you   So far  my favorite book of 2015  Paula Hawkins is a new voice to the  Psychological Thriller  genre  and she jumps in with bang   The Girl on the Train  revolves around the narration of three women and the three men they are involved with  The story is told by the three female characters Rachel Watson is a falling down drunk alcoholic  Her alcoholism  brought on by depression due to her inability to conceive a baby  has led to the loss of her job and the dissolution of her marriage  She has a place to live  due to the kindness of a friend  but she travels back and forth  daily  on the train from Ashbury to Euston on the outskirts of London  pretending to look for work  Each day she must travel past the home that she once shared with Tom  her ex husband  A home Tom now shares with the woman he married after his divorce from Rachel  The woman with whom he carried on an affair  A woman  Anne  with which he now has a child A few houses down from where she once lived she daily observes the lives of the two people that now reside there  These two people  whom she has named Jess and Jason  are living the life she wishes Tom and she had lived  All s well until Rachel witnesses an event that will shatter their perfect life together Megan and Scott Hipwell are the real names of Jess and Jason  and Megan is missing  The police will suspect Scott is responsible  Rachel must tell someone about what she has seen in order to protect Scott  But will anyone believe an alcoholic  Rachel has her own secret  She was in Witney  the town where Tom and Anne  Scott and Megan live  on the night Megan disappeared  However  she can t remember what happened because she was falling down drunk and suffers from black outs  The only memory she has is of Tom trying to help her that night  right before Anne  his wife  gets into their car and they drive away  Hawkins grips the read with a story that builds in tension as Rachel tries to overcome her addiction to alcohol in order to remember what happened the night Megan goes missing  By interjecting herself into the police investigation she opens old wounds and is the cause of new ones  The suspense deepens as Rachel bit by bit regains pieces of her memory of that fateful night Paula Hawkins  whom some are comparing to Gillian Flynn  Gone Girl   slowly builds up the tension until the mystery of Megan s disappearance comes to an explosive and unexpected end  Ms  Hawkins has the potential to become a bright new star in the literary firmament  The characters are well developed and the story pulls the reader along on a fantastic  Train  ride to a shock filled ending  This is a dark story with characters that are not well liked  but like voyeurs  the reader will want to look through the windows of their lives  A highly recommended read  If you like unreliable narrators this book is for you  Nearly every character in this book is unstable in some way  especially Rachel who  to me at least  was the  primary  narrator over the other two women  She constantly romanticizes some characters despite evidence that they are guilty  while becoming paranoid and suspicious of others who don t deserve it  Often it is only after an incident is described by all three narrators that a full picture begins to form  I can see how this might make the book unappealing for some because every character is so messed up that there s no one to  root for   but I really liked having such a twisted narrative Some reviews describe this book as  fast paced   Most of it is  but I thought several of Rachel s chapters were paced very slowly compared to the rest of the book  This isn t necessarily a bad thing  it gives an insight into Rachel s life as an alcoholic and her frustrating search for the truth  It would have lessened her character to skip her struggles with drinking or parts of the story when she feels she has exhausted her leads and doesn t know how to move forward  but it did add some parts of the book that were slightly difficult to get through The Girl on the Train is often compared to Gone Girl  There are some similarities  and I think fans of Gone Girl will like this book  but it is by no means a rip off or copy cat  In Gone Girl  Nick is at the center of the investigation  so much of the plot focuses on the police investigation  the media portrayal of the case  etc  This is only briefly touched on in The Girl on the Train since the narrators have minimal involvement with the official investigation despite being so entangled in the incident  It is more about their personal struggle to understand not just the circumstances around the crime but  more importantly  the other very inconsistent and unreliable players in the events of the night of the crime The ending was very dramatic and ended quite suddenly  leaving me with a few unanswered questions   view spoiler  Abdic and Scott both were disregarded at the end when the true killer began to emerge  What was Abdic s motive for revealing Megan s past  Is that even legal  Why did Scott hide the fact that he knew about Megan s infidelity  Presumably he thought it would give the police a motive for him to kill Megan  but later when Rachel told him about Abdic he acted thankful to her for giving the police another suspect to consider    hide spoiler   Overall  I loved watching the characters unravel as they got closer and closer to the end  What  A  Ride  I love being catapulted into a book  The Girl on the Train lived up to expectations   and then some  Hawkins uniquely oriented you to time and place and characters    and then subtlety encouraged you further  Great character unfolding  Empathy  Vision  Intrigue  There were so many twists along this track  but it was perfectly orchestrated so that wasn t confusing  just surprising and suspenseful  Cool cool read   I loved the book  I went into it knowing nothing about it and with no expectations  Each character is a complete effed up mess in their own way  but I didn t find them all unlikeable  I could relate to the feeling of pity experienced by Rachel and the feeling of being left with nothing  I didn t see the plot twist coming but then again I wasn t looking for anything  I just took whatever twists and turns as they came  and thoroughly enjoyed the ride    Great read  Uiteindelijk toch wel een mooi boek  The Girl on the Train was a great  fast read  It hit a little too close to home having lived with a sociopath myself  It dug into some painful memories which I didn t enjoy but the book itself was VERY good  Sociopaths walk among us and not all kill but MOST are destructive with the people s lives with which they interact  They figure out early on how to manipulate because they don t live with consciouses to make them feel guilty  They lie and cheat to get their way  I felt much sympathy with the characters of this novel and know there are many people in real life who have lived  living or will live with these masterminds of destruction  Great read  Paula Hawkins  this book will hook you and will never ever let you go  recommended for inflight reading  Over the years  I have discovered that best selling books are usually best sellers for a reason and this book is no exception to the rule  The book features a fairly unpleasant protagonist  Rachel  a whining  self indulgent alcoholic and builds very slowly  but the mystery builds to a dramatic ending  Here is the Amazon review   An Amazon Best Book of the Month  January 2015  Intersecting  overlapping  not quite what they seem lives  Jealousies and betrayals and wounded hearts  A haunting unease that clutches and won t let go  All this and more helps propel Paula Hawkins s addictive debut into a new stratum of the psychological thriller genre  At times  I couldn t help but think  Hitchcockian  From the opening line  the reader knows what they re in for   She s buried beneath a silver birch tree  down towards the old train tracks     But Hawkins teases out the mystery with a veteran s finesse  The  girl on the train  is Rachel  who commutes into London and back each day  rolling past the backyard of a happy looking couple she names Jess and Jason  Then one day Rachel sees  Jess  kissing another man  The day after that  Jess goes missing  The story is told from three character s not to be trusted perspectives  Rachel  who mourns the loss of her former life with the help of canned gin and tonics  Megan  aka Jess   and Anna  Rachel s ex husband s wife  who happens to be Jess Megan s neighbor  Rachel s voyeuristic yearning for the seemingly idyllic life of Jess and Jason lures her closer and closer to the investigation into Jess Megan s disappearance  and closer to a deeper understanding of who she really is  And who she isn t  This is a book to be devoured   Neal Thompson As a girl who takes the train into work myself  I was compelled to read this  Rachel takes the commuter train into London every day  and while riding stares out the window at a row of houses where she used to live  She sees a husband and wife and fantasizes about how perfect their life is  She is wishing that was her own life  Rachel used to live a few doors down happily married  Now divorced she is a broken woman whose life is spiralling out of control  One day she sees something that changes everything and makes her realise the couple s perfect life is not so perfect  The story is told from the perspective of Rachel  her husband s new wife  and the woman she watched from the window of the train  This is a hard book to put down  Rachel is a vulnerable woman who wants to be better than she is  but continues to let her problem with alcohol drag her back down  This is a psychological thriller that will take you on a ride  I enjoyed the book to the very end  Nice who dun it  kept me guessing to the climax  even with the nudges  The saga of Rachel  Megs  Scott  Tom  Anna  the red haired man  Riley  and the doctor  I ve already made sure it s available for my wife and my mother to read   No  they are not one and the same  Review to come  but    OHMYGOD    This book was amazing  I m so glad I read it  I wasn t so sure about it at the beginning  I wasn t identifying with any of the characters but found them very interesting  The interest and suspense grew stronger and stronger  It was quite beneficial and enjoyable being in the heads of various characters  I m satisfied with the ending  Well done  Paula Hawkins  I m looking forward to seeing what they ve do with the movie version of this  This book is truly a masterpiece  It s really well written  psychological and twisty  I really couldn t put the book down in the end  because it just kept getting more and more interesting    5 stars  My favorite book of this year so far  Definitely not what I was expecting but in a good way  Riveting story  great thrillerI couldn t put this book down  Read it on my first day of vacation all in one day  Excellent read I couldn t put it down  once I got past the beginning  Truly unpredictable  Everyone in this book is crazy in some way  The comparisons to  Gone Girl  are definitely on target  In fact  I liked this one even more  You felt connected with each of the women  mn lktb lty tqwl fy nfsk  nh  shkran ll qdr lty qdtny lyh  bwl

seriously phew    This was a mile a minute book  You know when you hear a review saying it was unputdownable but in reality its totally not  This is  I literally left my 3 year old in his pjs till noon so I could finish this book  I was also in my pjs but its okay I put the fancy  Duvet Day  label on it and suddenly it s acceptable again  Anyway as I was saying this was such an exciting book  It was such an original plot but once you start reading it you wonder why didn t anyone think of this storyline before  Who hasn t sat in a train or a bus and looked out the window at a house or business and spied on the people moving around within  Humans are naturally curious and I am not an exception to the rule  I love people watching and wondering where that woman is headed and what that man does for a living  Don t we all do this to a certain extent  The book centers around Rachel  a woman who is going through a hard stage in her life  She is not instantly likeable which isn t shocking as most drunks aren t all that appealing to the majority of people  However you do start to feel for her situation and wonder is she truly completely to blame for the predicament she finds herself in  Can other people or situations drive a person to drink or to have mental health issues  Maybe  Maybe definitely  I don t want to give away too much of the plotline but this book is well worth buying and I d recommend to anyone  This book was not what I was expecting  The writing  especially for someone who had never wrote a fiction book before  was amazing  It was so easy to follow and I found myself thinking about the  who done it  a lot  when I picked this up in the bookstore i didn t think it would be as good as it was  I m not a huge fan of diary form writing  The books split into three POV s Rachel Anna and Megan  In the beginning I found myself hating reading Anna s side of the story  Until the end where everything happens to her and Rachel  In my opinion the beginning of the story was a little slow paced which is fine but it all made sense  I really loved the Jess and Jason idea  And I did want to slap Rachel at times because she forgets a lot because of her drinking  the last about 30 pages WOW  The way Paula Hawkins put that all together  It just made perfect sense  Everything came together and you get annoyed with yourself that you didn t think of that  The least suspecting character  I thought it was Anna because she was such a bitch but I guess you will have to find out who did it    and what it is they did     I loved the fact The author picked up on many controversial issues like Alcohol and domestic abuse  And wrote so carefully with detail about it  I think this is good as a lot of people can relate  unfortunately  I think this might be one of the reasons this book has done so well  Well done Paula Hawkins for writing this amazing book   Nailbitingly tense and un downable thriller a la  Gone Girl   The central character Rachel is an alcoholic prone to blackouts and harbours an unhealthy obsession with her ex husband Tom  Despite having being fired from her job months ago  Rachel continues her daily commute  taking the same train every day and enjoying spying on the occupants of one particular house en route on a street where we later learn she used to live before her own life unravelled  One morning Rachel spots something amiss and when the girl she has been watching goes missing  Rachel goes to the police  feeling she has seen something which could be important to the investigation  The narrative skillfully skips between Rachel and two other women Anna  Tom s new wife  and Megan  the missing girl  whose lives become tragically interlinked  Can we trust drunken  often irrational Rachel s narrative  Dismissed as a  rubbernecker  by the police and constantly badgering her ex with obsessive phonecalls  is she a reliable witness  Brilliantly constructed thriller which keeps the reader guessing until the end   4 5 5Do you enjoy a good physiological who dun it  Need that fix of the dark and suspenseful  Don t mind some seriously messed up people  This book is for you  I started it is and found that after 20  I couldn t put it down  I wanted to know what was happening This book tells the story of a woman gone missing from the POV of three women who as time goes on it becomes quite clear are more than they seem I found myself disappointed in the characters multiple time through out the story but the author was crafty enough to take the disappointment and disgust and mellow it out and make you want to read more  learn more about them  I found myself thinking constantly after 50   What is wrong with these people     Rachel is the first woman we are introduced to and we see through her POV that she has crafted lives and personalities for the man and woman she sees each morning on the train to London  She names them and stories for them  a rather innocuous thing that many of us make a game out of when we are people watching  This takes a horrible turn into the sad and pathetic realm when a devastating revelation comes about that has Rachel wanting to immerse herself more into their lives I did not see the ending coming early on  I was just as perplexed as several characters in the book  As the story unfolds and the clues get placed before you and the reality becomes clear you soon learn that some people are just messed the eff up in the head A must read if you like a good psychological thriller and this one focuses the story around the women involved  In fact I was reading this when I watched Gone Girl for the first time  never read the book  and it gave me that same people are messed up and omg feel  This book is absolutely fantastic  Best one I have read for a long time  A real page turner I was extremely eager to get on board with reading The Girl on the Train and waited patiently until my turn on the wait list at the local library  Upon starting this story  I would have been easily able to finish in one sitting but ultimately real life prevailed and I couldn t  This was no testament to the compelling story that Paula Hawkins tells  Very much in the same vein as Gone Girl and Big Little Lies  we are told the story from three separate female characters that are all entwined in one way or another  We are introduced to the  main  character Rachel  the sad   depressing underdog that I found myself rooting for  albeit I was infuriated with some of her choices  There is Anna  the  other woman  that you hate and then Megan  the woman no one knows too much about  yet Rachel is obsessed with her life via the small peeks inside her home from the train  These women are characters that as a reader you will love  hate and sometimes scream at your book on account of  When someone goes missing and the women have different memories of what happened that fateful night  a pile of clothes on the side of the tracks and flashes of recollect can turn the true past into the scary future where everything you have always believed to be true are not and the people you think you know so well and love and trust are not what they seem  A thrilling who done it that keeps you guessing until the very end  If you have not read this book yet  you are doing yourself an injustice  Contemporary Suspense  Romantic elementsLondonEvery day Rachel takes the same commuter train  Each day she goes by a stretch of cozy suburban homes and stops at a signal that lets her watch the same couple as they have breakfast on their deck  Every day she looks forward to it  After so much time she feels like she knows them and she calls them Jess and Jason  As far as she can tell their life is perfect  Like the life she recently lost Then one day she sees something that shocks her  It takes just a minute before the train moves on but it is long enough  Now nothing is the same  Rachel goes to the police to share what she knows  The police though feel she is unreliable but is she  All too soon she is deeply entangled in the lives of those involved  She is also deeply involved in the investigation  Now the question is has she done more harm than good  This is a great suspense story that keeps the reader engrossed until the very end  Just as the reader thinks they know where the story is headed it takes another twist that will have readers wondering just how this one is going to end  The characters are well written and so is the plot  While some readers might figured out how it is going to end there is still enough twists that it will keep readers turning the pages  This is one story that readers will find very hard to put down and will stay up all night to finish  This is one book that is a must read   I was reluctant to pick up this book  You know how it can be  Everyone is raving about this one book  you get it  and are disappointed when it does not live up to the hype  It is what happened to me when I read Gone Girl  and what I feared would happen when I began reading this book yesterday At first I was focusing on the fact that the narrators were annoying  not to mention unreliable  At some point  I realized that I was past that  Regardless of how irritating these women were  the tale they told was captivating and left me wanting more  Once it started barreling towards the revelation of what had transpired the night of the murder and the final climactic confrontation  I could not put it down  Actually  that is not true  During several scenes my heart was pounding so forcefully that I had to walk away and take deep breaths Ratingwise  it should be a 4 5  but for me it was closer to five than four so I gave it the extra half star  If you like suspense  read this book  My book had a Tess Gerritsen blurb on the cover and her words are spot on  it will suck up your entire afternoon  Enjoy and let me know what you thought  I really enjoyed this book  The male characters are interesting  but  oh  the women  The female characters are Complex  challenging  human  broken   real  I think it is a mistake just to focus on the reliability of the narrator  because  although that does heighten the experience  there are complex themes about marriage and motherhood that deserve equal tension  To sum up  a thrilling  chilling mystery with finely drawn female characters portrayed without a whiff of judgement who will stay with you long after the story is over  This book is worth it to be awarded as Best in Mystery and Thriller for this year s Goodreads Choice Awards  I swear it racked my brain back and forth  I m a newbie in reading this type of genre and I love how I turn into a fast reader when I m reading because I want to know who the killer is  Hahaha For this book  first of all I admit I thought of Gone Girl while reading but The Girl On Train was different  This was more complicated than Gone Girl but I loved it   The Girl on the Train is a hot mess  Her story is a nonstop page turner  No one is what they seem  As a fan of psychological thrillers and mysteries  I loved the way this was written  From the very beginning  I was hooked and couldn t wait to find out what really happened   Now THIS is A PAGE TURNER  I literally could not put this book down because it had me hooked within moments when reading the first chapter   Girl on the Train  is a twisted psychological thriller told through multiple character perspectives  all cleverly woven together by this talented author  I see that there s been a lot references and comparisons to  Gone Girl  amongst other readers but let me just say it s entirely different  a big common aspect however is the whole  things are not what they seem   If you liked  Gone Girl   you definitely will enjoy reading this book but I would definitely give credit when credit due in that  Girl on the Train  stands firmly on its own in this type of genre and I will be eagerly looking forward to reading more of this author s works  El final me dejo recalculando como 10min  Eso hace una buena historia  congelarte el cerebro hasta que no sepas ni que pensar  La historia me atrapo desde el principio y me dejaba siempre queriendo leer mas  No adivine nunca el final  en cada capitulo cambiaba de parecer y cada vez se volvia mas complicado asi que no tenia la mas PALIDA idea de que iba a pasar  Gracias a Dios no esperaba grandes cosas de este libro  Habia leido a mucha gente que iba con las expectativas de que seria el proximo Gone Girl  uno de mis libros favoritos  y se habia decepcionado por eso  Asi que mis expectativas al empezarlo eran pocas  Y creo que eso ayudo a que el libro me gustara tanto  Asi que les recomiendo que no lean muchas criticas  que no averiguen mucho de que trata  Vayan a comprarlo  empiecen a leer y listo  Me fascino  en serio  Habia momentos en los que no podia parar de leer y me abstraia del mundo  y eso es todo lo que busco de un libro  PD  Hawkins estas del carajo  Escribite algo mas  dale   I had a great time reading  rather listening to this book  I got the audible version of The Girl on the Train  Definitely drove many extra miles   just because I did not want to stop listening  Book is nicely crafted and even though all characters are primarily flawed   you keep turning pages to know what happens next in this Psychological thriller  You have to give credit to Paula Hawkins superb narration  Despite a slow start the book picks up and the author manages to keep readers engaged till they reach the very end  Having read thrillers all my life  I for one  was definitely taken by surprise at the big reveal in the end   that fact alone is an absolute winner for me when it comes to thrillers  If you are looking for an entertaining thriller  look no further  The Girl on the Train is here   I don t even know where to start  The word  wow  comes to mind but that doesn t properly illustrate how good this book was  It was compared to  Gone Girl  and I went in skeptical but quickly realized  oh yeah  It s like Gone Girl  It s like GG in that it is so dark  so unique you can t stop thinking about it  How do you read a book where the main character is just so despicable that it s almost painful to read  You get sucked in by good writing and you can t put the book down  This one succeeded in that I loved how the author slowly rolled out the story  The first few chapters are just about this girl  Rachel  on a train  The same morning train  and the same evening train  going into London for work  The train goes by a group of houses and she creates a story in her head about the people living in one of the houses  even gives them a name  Rachel sees a new pink curtain in the window of another house and it makes her sad  but you don t realize until several chapters later why  Turns out  she used to live in the house with the new pink curtain  Until her husband Tom kicked her out and moved in his mistress  Anna  who became his new wife and they had a daughter  Turns out  Rachel is a raging alcohol who blacks out and doesn t remember anything she does or says when drunk  Turns out she s harassing Tom and Anna when she blacks out  phone calls  harassing notes  stalking them at the house  her old house I don t want to give anymore away because the story twists and turns in such a brilliant way  This is probably one of the best books I ve read in a really long time  I could not stop reading it and even now  finished with the book  I feel so many different emotions   Joder   En serio   No puede ser  No puedo salir del asombro   Que genial novela   Me tuvo todo el tiempo entretenida  no podia dejar de leerla  Hay algo  tal vez la manera en la que esta escrita  aun no lo se  pero hay algo que hizo que pueda meterme realmente en la historia  Es decir  entendia perfectamente como se sentia cada personaje  Llegue a entender a Anna  y voy a recalcar que me parece un personaje totalmente odioso  y no pude soportarla en ningun momento  Nunca  pero nunca sospeche de quien lo hizo  Aun no puedo creerlo  Parecia un personaje convincente y dentro de sus cabales  pero demostro todo lo contrario en     cuanto    dos lineas tal vez  Al principio a todos los personajes se los veia de una manera diferente  y me encanta la idea de que recien un poco mas alla del final se muestre como son cada uno en verdad  Nunca nada es lo que parece  En serio  Nunca  Me senti muy complacida por Rachel  me gusto mucho su evolucion en toda la historia  Anna  vuelvo a repetir  no salio del papel de odiosa  Tom y Scott    bueno  Son Tom y Scott  Parecian tan diferentes  Siento pena por ambos  Mas por Scott  quien sabe a donde fue a parar  En fin  cinco estrellas bien merecidas   I love a book that lets me get nothing done all day because I can t put it down  Loved it   What a relief to know that I am not the only person who looks out of a train window and makes up stories for the inhabitants  that is how we meet our chief protagonist Rachel  Sitting on a train commuting to London the train routinely stops at lights in one particular stop  Rachel spots a couple sitting on their makeshift roof terrace and assigns them names  Jessie and Jason  and an idyllic life to match  As we get to know Rachel better we begin to understand why this essentially imaginary couple are so important to her  Rachel is unhappily divorced  living in a shared house and she s an alcoholic but fear not this book while ensuring the consequences of her drinking are clear doesn t play us endless scenes of her drinking herself into oblivion  it is far cleverer than that giving instead a taster of her morning and evening from a selection of days starting on 5 July 2013 and ending on 18 August of the same year When one routine morning she sees something that shatters her views of her imaginary couple and this event becomes an obsession as its significance is revealed  This is an ingeniously constructed story told not only from Rachel s viewpoint  but those of two other women  Anna and Megan too  Megan s story begins a year before Anna s and although the relevance of her story isn t immediately apparent I still wanted to know more about her  As the story progresses the way these three women s lives are connected becomes apparent  and then the fun really starts with the action ramping up along with the tension  With the split in viewpoint perfectly timed so that the reader doesn t feel that the switch has been purposely inserted to prolong the suspense  although it certainly does that I was hooked on this story  I trusted not one of the characters  I ll be honest  none of them are people you d aspire to be  rather they are people with issues  unfortunate personalities and they all picked up too many narcissistic genes from the gene pool  but the author manages to keep them the right side of caricatures  unfortunates among you may have met people just like them  The plot is full of sub plots which almost compels you to judge these people and their behaviour which just served to fuel my suspicions about each and every one of them even more This is an accomplished debut written by an author who has exactly the right balance of ingredients for a psychological suspense novel  a well plotted mystery  a handful of life like characters  events revealed at the right time and an ending that didn t disappoint I d like to thank the publishers Transworld for allowing me to read a proof copy of this book ahead of publication date on 15 January 2015 and I sincerely hope Paula Hawkins has another book in the pipeline   4 5 stars  I really enjoyed this book   this book was great  I have heard people say that the characters are unlikeable  but what they are is human  flawed and ugly humans  like the ones that exist in real life  I didn t piece together what was going on until I was almost finished with the book  and i was very grateful for that  I am not sure if that was oblivion on my part or a job well done on Paula Hawkin s  but when I finally realized what was going on  I was giddy with surprise  I love when i get taken off guard  However  I m not sure if the ending was too fast  or if i read it too fast  Anyways  the book was excellent  I started it having no idea what it was about  and ripped through it  Highly recommend   One of the best thrillers I have read in a long time  Difficult to put down  Loved this book   Freaking fantastic  Multiple narrators done so well  with such purpose  The plot has you guessing until almost the very end   I read this book over 24 hours at the beach and it was perfect  Couldn t put it down  Everyone felt like a suspect and I kept thinking I knew who was the  bad guy   and was only sort of right in the end  Good character development and a solid plot  even if it has been done before  Recommend  Totally compelling and gripping   I had to read this one as quickly as possible  What s unique about this mystery is that the main protagonist  Rachel  narrates the story and tells about a house she sees everyday on the train  Then we flip between Rachel and two other women  Megan and Anna  and hear their side of the story  Each of them reveals a different piece of the puzzle  I did the Kindle whisper sync thing with this one and got the Audible version too   I highly  highly recommend the audiobook  There are 3 different narrators for each woman  all excellent  but I found the one who spoke for Megan   Louise Brealey   her performance was haunting  Even if I was reading on the Kindle  when it came to Megan s chapters  I had to stop and switch the to listen to her read the chapter  De meningen over dit boek zijn verdeeld  lezers noemen het een deprimerend boek over beschadigde mensen  Dat is het ook  Het is meer een psychologische roman dan een thriller  Maar wat het zo goed maakt  is dat het zo geloofwaardig geschreven is  Geen sensationele plotwendingen maar een verhaal met levensechte karakters en de omderhuidse spanning wordt langzaam opgebouwd  De situaties lijken allemaal heel alledaags  wie zit er niet in de trein naar de achterkant van huizen te kijken en zich af te vragen wat daar allemaal gebeurt  Het is een boek dat beklijft  in tegenstelling tot veel thrillers waarvan je binnen een dag al weer vergeten bent waar ze ook al weer over gingen  All the below are my probably annoying over excited updates along the way posted on various websites  bit mostly here  but I truly need to breathe  There s no cozy up and have a nice cup of tea with this one  There s grab the closest and strongest drink and know that being in a constant state of tension will be your best friend while you re reading and my advice if you plan to sleep      don t plan to sleep  eat or breathe  Just read   I feel like my inside a have been twisted and pulled and tied into knots and left here sitting without mercy insanely and deliciously traumatized  Yes  I just used the word deliciously for this because I wanted to swallow this book whole      but I didn t have to  It climbed in and ripped my guts out page by page sentence by sentence word by every single WTH is going on taunting word

true   OMFG   January 13 14  2015 update  HEA books have made me cry  but  TheGirlOnTheTrain I can t explain  It s suspense  crime  thriller  mystery   Why  How  Is it building up tears inside ready to burst from my eyes  I m holding back a powerful sense of tears  My eyes want to gush tears  I cannot understand how a book of this genre is doing this  It s intense  Insanely intense so I guess the build up of what s happening is making me nearly burst  I keep putting it down to breathe   also because I don t want it to end  There s  never  been a book that I ve welled up with tears at the thought of it ending   I ve read amazing books  It can t end    but I ve got to know what happens         How   LOL How is this  book doing this to me  How did the  author write this that s gripped me and turned my insides into twisted knots of suspense     I don t know  but THANK YOU  PaulaHawkins January 14  2015 2 39 a m   Reading update  I keep picking this up  reading some and putting it down  I cannot breathe  I ve picked it up again just about two minutes ago  got through one paragraph and had to set it down  I have my share of all time favorite books  however there has been no other in my lifetime that s done this  That s made me feel like this  I m all over the place with scenarios which I  never  do when I read and I m not even trying to do that now  but it s impossible not to  Don t question just buy  Just hit that link below and buy  Amazon purchase link  http   www amazon com Girl Train Paul    This book had intriguing characters and the mystery was compelling  I liked the pace  which perked along alternating view points of Rachel  Megan and Anna and I liked the alcoholic flaw of the main character  I stayed up nights reading this one to find out what happened to Megan and would anyone ever aknowledge Rachel  Creepy but a good read  I loved this book  i loved how there were so many twists and turns and how the story unfolds leading us into the lives of those in Blenheim Road  Im not going to ramble on about the storyline as the book s synopsis already does this  but it was well written and kept me turning the pages  The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins  In Hawkins  first thriller  the story is told in the style of Gone Girl reflecting through Rachel  Anna and Megan s memories  It quickly picks up and like a train speeds rapidly through the pages Readers along on the high charged journey will find themselves second guessing the characters  motives  A chilling murder  psychological flashbacks  plot twists and a climax that begs for release  those who get over the threshold will find themselves holding their breath until the killer is revealed   WOW  So if you ve read any of my reviews before you ll notice that this type of book is quite different than my usual fare  I m not sure what compelled me to give it a whirl  It s been compared to Gone Girl which I didn t read but saw with my wife  and boy was that creepy  Then I read a review calling it disturbing like Hitchcock  That got me very interested  Finally  on the back of the book  Laura Kasischke  one of my very favorite contemporary POETS gave it a glowing blurb So I was all in for the ride  no pun intended  from then on  I read a lot of poetry  I read a lot of history  I read a lot of Raymond Carver and John Cheever stories  And you know what  This was really good  It s not particularly literary  it s not well written in an aesthetic sense  But Hawkins does a fine job of building and holding suspense through the now commonplace technique of switching narrative points of view with each chapter  Had I read Gone Girl or many other suspense novels which do this I probably would have been annoyed at the cliche  But I enjoyed it here  I had to look back at previous chapters to check their dates and their authors  I even took a few notes in the margin to keep track of my reactions  The characters are a LITTLE more than types  not much  But I wasn t reading this book for character  This isn t Roth  It s a VERY successful thriller that  in the end  DOES have the quality of Hitchcock spookiness  Cue the requisite stormy nights and unreliable narrators  But this is also about the dark places which make us want to run up the steps at night  worried someone will grab at our heels as we make our way to the people with whom we re sure we re safe  Hawkins knows how to manipulate these fears masterfully  and for that  she deserves credit and my five stars   I can t    let me just say this book isn t for the faint of heart  It deals with many serious issues  alcoholism  betrayal  lies  love  and love lost   This is not light reading  This is thought provoking  heart wrenching work  And you will love every bit of it   Even if you ll feel like putting on a happy Disney movie after to lift your spirits  Rachel is an alcoholic  sad  lonely and depressed  She pines after her ex husband and her perfect life  She rides the train every morning pretending to go to work so her kind landlady friend would not realize she d lost her job  Rachel is an empathetic character and you ll love her despite her flaws  Throughout the book you will see snippets of other women s point of view  Anna  Rachel s ex husband s mistress turned wife  and Megan  Anna s neighbor  ex babysitter  wife to a jealous husband  One day  Megan goes missing Rachel throws herself into the mystery  It feels good to have something distracting her from her sorrow  And we  the readers  are absorbed into her investigation  her struggles  her pain  And secrets begin to unveil themselves  slowly  keeping readers guessing till the very end Halfway through I felt I needed some sunshine and fresh air  because the description was so vivid  so real  that I felt choked by Rachel s depiction of alcoholism and depression  Despite all that  I could not stop reading  What happened to Megan  What happened the night Megan disappeared   the night Rachel cannot remember  A riveting thriller  and one with a great ending  The writing is masterful  and the plot unravels at perfect speed  Well worth the hype  This one is highly recommended if you don t mind darker  emotionally intense fiction   If Alfred Hitchcock was alive he would turn this one into a Masterpiece   If you read GoneGirl and if you like it  Im sure you gonne love this oneThe Girl on the Train travels with good pace  with twists and turns in every halt  Paula Hawkins make an fantastic debut with this one  which makes the reader unpredictable To be frank it was the first time i came across completely different writing style which makes the suspense more gripping  Hawkins holds group of charecters so perfectly not to reveal the suspense and makes the reader to travel with them till the end of the book Take a Bow Paula Hawkins for the fantastic gripping Debut thriller Loved itundoubtedly this will be one of the best books released this year I could not put this one down  highly recommend  I d had my eye on this book for a while  and when I finally got around to reading it  I wasn t disappointed  Paula Hawkins s debut novel is full of tension  and she has a superb way of leaving a chapter in a way that just grabs you by the short ones and forces you to keep reading  It s very rare that I finish a book and still think about it without rushing to the next book  but this time I just can t help it  This is an excellent story and it s superbly told with full  real  relatable characters  Just finished reading The Girl on the Train  Evocative of Gillian Flynn s Gone Girl  yet this is a wholly different beast  Finely crafted plot and wonderful imagery by Paula Hawkins   My head leaning against the carriage window  I watch these houses roll past me like a tracking shot in a film  I see them as others do not  even their owners probably don t see them from this perspective  Twice a day  I am offered a view into other lives  just for a moment  There s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home   A gruesome tale of voyeurism  discontent and longing for love  A whodunit filled with intrigue that fits squarely in Hitchock Fincher territory Rachel is weary of her own life  she finds solace in fantasizing about the life of a young couple in a house she passes by everyday while commuting on the train  From being a passive onlooker  how does she becomes entangled in their lives  Will she find her footing in a murky world of lies  betrayal and shifting realities Having an unreliable narrator prone to blackouts  trying to piece together events from the day of the crime  is a masterstroke from the author  The voices of Rachel  Megan and Anna are still ringing in my ears     We re tied together  forever bound by the stories we told    https   rajeshmoviegoer wordpress com    Got this book as a Christmas gift  Excellent  Simply excellent  It wasn t even the plot that intrigued me   though I must say the suspense certainly kept me on my toes   it was the author s ability to bring the characters to life   to move me  They were all flawed  yes   and maybe to some people it was depressing  But that only means the author did her job and did it well  Beautiful written  It was the first time in a long time I couldn t put a book down   As good as Gone Girl Very  Gone Girl   Loved the alternating viewpoints and didn t suspect the ending until the final 30 pages  A fantastic read  Hope this author has started on book  2  WOW  Wow  Just     Wow   What can I say  The narration was top notch  The characters were completely messed up  I spent most of the book looking for twists and clues and was still somewhat surprised when the first clues were reveled about the real killer   view spoiler   That nasty Anna didn t surprise me in the least    hide spoiler   The characters are so compelling  At times you fall in love with them  then pity them  then can t stand them  but you feel like you know each and everyone of them well  It is perfectly paced  you fall into the beginning and are captivated straight to the ending where the twists are unexpected  The alternating points of view were a little offsetting at times and the dates seemed to be too much work to figure out  but the story is so well written and told  there is no need to worry about the dates   I was totally hooked and unable to put it down  A great read  Lots of suspense  You ll love it if you loved the Gillian Flynn novels   Every bit as good as Gone Girl  More reviews available at my blog  Beauty and the Bookworm I read Gone Girl recently  so The Girl on the Train seemed like the next logical step  given how often people compare them  Having finished it  I can see why they do  but also feel like the comparison doesn t really do either book justice  as they re not really similar in a larger sense  Both feature people behaving badly and narrators who could be classified as unreliable  but whereas a narrator in Gone Girl is intentionally unreliable  none of the narrators in The Girl on the Train are intentionally misleading  The bad behaviors are similar in part  you know  murder  adultery  mental and emotional manipulation  the usual  but are set up in such a different context that they work into the story very differently  The Girl on the Train also seemed to move faster  to me  maybe because all of the characters become involved so early on  while in Gone Girl things just keep coming up slowly Anyway  The Girl on the Train follows Rachel  who is pretty much a hot mess  She s an unemployed alcoholic  and yes  the two are related  who has been in a sort of limbo ever since she and her husband divorced two years ago  Well  really the mess of her life started earlier than that  when they tried to have a kid and couldn t  sending Rachel into a spiral that ended in their divorce  She has a roommate now  and to hide her unemployment she still takes the train into London every day  On the way  she looks at the houses by the tracks  particularly one a few doors down from where she used to live so that she can see the couple she has deemed  Jason  and  Jess   who she imagines to be wildly in love with each other  until she sees Jess with another man  Several days later  news comes out that a woman has gone missing  and by her picture Rachel immediately realizes it s Jess  She gets swept up in the drama of the entire investigation  hooked by her imaginings of Jason and Jess  life together  even though she knows that those aren t really their names and that their lives were really nothing like she pictured in her head  Out of all the characters in this book  Rachel is the only good one  Yes  she is an alcoholic  but her life is pretty shit  so that s pretty understandable  and as the story goes on she tries to improve herself  The other characters  well  with the exception of a few supporting folk  like Rachel s roommate and the guy on the train  are all abusive  manipulative  and cheaters  in various combinations of those characteristics  This made it very easy to root for Rachel  to want her to figure it all out and improve her own life into the bargain  though the logic of how that would  exactly  tie in is somewhat missing  On the other hand  it s hard to want to root for a character who wants to  get rid of the bitch once and for all  or who spends her time having a string of affairs or any number of other poor behaviors exhibited by the people in this novel The mystery is intriguing because there are so many different possibilities for who killed Jess Megan  and to some degree all of them make sense  As the layers of the story get pulled back  everything becomes more and more tangled  more and more twisted  until the big reveal and the climax I think I liked this more than Gone Girl  overall  it wasn t as long  it moved faster  and I found the characters more intriguing on the whole than those in Gone Girl  And Rachel was a much more relatable protagonist than Nick  who I never really liked because of the shitty choices he made  Rachel made shitty choices  too  but not like Nick did  And come on  Girl on the Train is British  which just makes absolutely everything sound so much more posh and sophisticated  don t you think  Sure  the logic of  woman solves mystery and therefore improves her own life  isn t entirely there  but that s not really the point of the genre  and so I m willing to give it a pass on that one  I loved this  and heartily recommend it  Also  it can count for the Popsugar 2016 Reading Challenge category of  A book being made into a movie this year   Yay  What a brilliant book kept me engaged all the way through a must read  Oh my  I have been studying novel writing techniques and Hawkins has nailed it with this fast paced thriller  It is not going to be a literary option for the Pulitzer for fiction but it will most likely get a movie deal The story captivates the reader from the first page  The characters are flawed beyond understanding but that is part of the appeal  As you continue to make your way through the story  you can t help but wonder how you would act react to both the interpersonal and intrapersonal conflicts the book develops It does make you reflect on the weaknesses that woman have when they give too much of themselves to a relationship instead of building their own identity  Yet  it also makes you reflect on the bad choices you may have made in your own life and if you are lucky  how you walked away just in time  Awesome  Loved it   great ending  Reminded me of many frustrating journeys on the Thameslink into London   I really enjoy a book that keeps you guessing on who done it  And I kept flipping through multiple people in this book and coming back to them multiple times  So it was a fun book to try to figure out  I hope that Rachel stays clean  It is nice to see an author portray a female alcoholic as it s almost always a male  however  there are plenty of females as well So the story is about a girl  Rachel  riding a train every day to London for work  or later pretending to work  Every day the train stops at a signal where she ends up lined up behind a house down the street from where her ex husband lives with his new wife  mistress while they were married  and Rachel fantasies and creates a story for  Jess  and  Jason  and how happily they are married  Then the train will roll on and she ll see her old house  Soon with pink blinds in one window  they are having a baby So one night Rachel is out and she s drinking and she ends up blacking out and ends up home in her bed but doesn t remember how she got there or what happened the night before  And soon she see the news and finds that  Jess  is missing and that her name is Megan  Her husband is the prime suspect  Rachel had seen Megan kissing another man on their back deck that day though while she was riding the train  So she tries to tell Scott   Jason  about this  And the detectives  Her story isn t enough though when the police realize she s a drunk  So the rest of the book goes through Megan s point of view in her last few months before she was missing  and Rachel s current time trying to regain her memory  While also trying to avoid her ex husband and his new wife Anna  As Anna hates Rachel and wants her gone  Tom  Rachel s ex husband  keeps telling Rachel to stay away from them  but since Rachel keeps trying to talk to Scott and help him with finding Megan she is passing her old house all the time  A very inter twisted story of these 5 people  A gripping  and psychological  suspenseful book  What a roller coaster ride  This book had incredible and unanticipated twists and turns  Without giving away any plot  the writing style perfectly fit the main character s sometimes misguided and often frantic mindset  I was at the edge of my seat  I look forward to reading the next book from Paula Hawkins  Thrilling and gripping  An Addictive read  A must read  Muthis beklentilerle okunmamasi gereken  zaman zaman ayni ic hesaplasmalari okumaktan insani yoran  polisiyeyle alakasi olmayan ancak farkli kategori adi altinda degerlendirildiginde  ornegin dram ya da psikolojik  basarili buldugum kitap  Benim gibi yillarin polisiye gerilim okuyuculari muhtemelen sonunu tahmin edilemez bulmayacaktir  Ama yine de beni kendine cekti  iki gunde akici

alacaksiniz   Holy guacamole    That s right Fergie Ferg  I was completely addicted to this book  properly obsessed  didn t want to put it down With every chapter some new secret is revealed and you realize everything you think you know   YOU DON T KNOW SHIT So I won t be able to do this review without spoiling the book so   JESSI BOOK CASTING So what do we know We have Rachel Rachel is a mess  used to be gorgeous vivacious happy girl who is now taking the train everyday into the city under the guise of going to her job that she no longer has  semi stalking her ex husband  his new wife and daughter  and fantasizing about a couple who live down the lane from her old home  Also quite a bit of day drinking Her Ex husband  Tom Tom is a hottie who may still have feelings for Rachel but is possibly the king of mixed signalsTom s new wife Anna In all honesty I never warm to her and at several points was kind of like Then we have the neighborsMegan Jess Clearly many issues for poor Megan  also following her train of thought was like herding cats  and Scott Jason Another hottie who you were not sure if you should feel bad for or be terrified of Enjoyed this book so much couldn t put it down but seriously they were all kind of  view spoiler   C  ts weren t they    hide spoiler   Loved this  Could not put it down  At its heart  this book is about being a voyeur  about creating stories about strangers so that you have somewhere to belong  The author does an incredible job of building suspense and drawing you into the characters  lives  almost as though you yourself are a voyeur  My only critiques  The three main female characters are all hot messes who rely on men or booze to make them whole  in fact  they love being mistresses because it makes them feel desired  I would ve loved to see some stronger  more fully developed female characters  And while the book kept me on my toes the whole time  the very end felt somewhat like an episode of Scooby Doo  Once the villain is revealed  he she spills the beans in a long winded confession that feels a little forced 4 5 stars really  I highly recommend this one  Couldn t put it down    Loved the realness of the main character  It keeps you hooked till the very end  A murder mystery which doesn t reveals all it s cards till the end  It was a fun read  At first  I wasn t sure I would like this book  The main character was hard to like  but then things got interesting and I didn t want to put the book down  I really had no idea who the  bad guy  was until the end   Review http   giuliana bookspassion blogspot    Who is the girl on the train  The woman you are introduced to on page one is one person  The woman you become familiar is someone else  This book is ingeniously exposes all as the story unfolds  bit by bit  Rachel is the  Girl on the Train  and the central character  Little details are slowly revealed   Rachel s commute  the people she observes  where she lives  how she lives  and why  Just when you think you know the story or know the characters  another fact is dropped   another twist develops  Sometimes you will feel sorry for Rachel  Other times you will be proud of her  rooting for her  afraid for her  frustrated with her or angry with her  It will not stop you from turning the page  Just when you think you have it figured out   you realize that you don t  I did figure out a couple of key components in the plot  but now before a lot of other scenarios crossed my mind with a good bit of second guessing thrown in This novel will be difficult to put down and will keep you guessing until the end   I didn t think I would like  no love this book at the beginning but it grabbed hold and I couldn t put it down  The author did a masterful job of keeping the suspense going with all the twists of the human mind  A great read   The Girl On The Train  by Paula Hawkins is set in England and follows Rachel Watson  a middle aged alcoholic with a broken heart who takes the train every day to London and notices a happy looking couple who live at one of the stops  She nicknames the Jess and Jason  and gazes out the window at them every time the train reaches their spot   being secretly jealous of their seemingly idyllic relationship  while nursing her own broken heart for Tom  a man who has since re married and had one child with Anna  his new wife  and who incidentally live close by to Jess and Jason  Soon  however  Rachel learns that everything is not as it seems  when she spies Jess kissing another man  and soon after learns of her disappearance  Rachel eventually learns that Jess s and Jason s real names are Megan and Scott  and becomes obsessed with solving Megan s disappearance The story is told from the point of view of Rachel  flash backs from Megan  prior to her disappearance   and Anna  Rachel s beloved ex s current wife  All three are complicated characters  especially Rachel  who is full of self loathing and disappointment at the sudden interruption of her imagined fairy tale of what a happy couple s life would look like  while being unable to get over her breakup with Tom and his new life without her  On one of the days  Rachel takes the train  sees a man  blacks out  and comes to with a mysterious bump on her head  blacking out on all of the day s events  Interestingly this happens to be at the same time as Megan disappears  So Rachel s narration of the events is filled with this big black hole  So is Megan s  as while we learn about the events leading up to her disappearance  it remains unclear what caused it  And then there s Anna s narration  which reveals she has a dark side to her as well  Ultimately  this story turns into a  who can we trust  as it increasingly seems that the answer is no one  as the web of events shaping the mystery keeps getting tighter  Rachel loves Tom who loves Anna who hires Megan as a babysitter for their child  while Megan is married to Scott but is not the ideal wife she pretends to be  Ultimately  this story is shaped as a  whodunit   but goes a lot deeper than that  This thriller touches upon many themes  including obsessive love  cheating  stalking  alcoholism  mid life crisis  domestic violence  jealousy  hatred  and deceit among many others  At its core  this is a very dark story  with strong characters set against the backdrop of the disappearance of one of the central characters  a quest to solve the disappearance and get her old life back from another  as well as a goal to get rid of her husband s harasser once and for all from the third  Overall  I thought it was a dark and engaging mystery   For VERY good reason there is huge hype surrounding this book once I picked it up it was very hard for me to put down The Story is told from 3 points of view Rachel  Megan and Anna which works perfectly as it gave totally different aspects to the story  The story kept me on my toes throughout and I did not work out the major twist which occurs  Some Characters were not likable but this did not spoil by enjoyment of the book  A fantastic debut from Paula Hawkins  I haven t read a book that I loved this much in a long time  I can t really explain how I feel  it had me tied in knots the whole time  Sympathising with Rachel when I felt that perhaps I shouldn t  I always get a very uneasy  unsettled feeling when someone writes or I hear about a baby s death and I think this added to the mystery and feeling of depth of the book  Do not expect a happy  fluff ending  Having only just finished it a minute ago  I m going to have to sit on this book and think about how I feel about it and what I thought  I might even read it again to get a better understanding of the characters But bloody brilliant is all I can say   Excellent read  I am usually not a fan of books where the characters are so hard to like but I really enjoyed this novel  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a bit of drama and intrigue  What a great read twists and turns galore  I couldn t put it down  This book 100  lived up to its hype  it is  masterfully  written  I won t say any more about it because you should really read it blindly but suffice it to say I loved everything about it and hopefully you will too   Could not put this book down  I did figure out what had happened just before it came out in the book  Really good read  Read it You won t be able to stop turning the pages Suspenseful  we ll developed  captivating plot with a twist and characters intertwined throughout  I was very excited to read this novel because of its classification as a psychological thriller  Though this book was a thriller  I m not sure I would call it psychological This story was certainly a mystery  but it was fairly straight forward  There were things that were slowly revealed and some surprises  but I was never caught truly off guard realizing that I had been interpreting something wrong all along  With that being said  I still loved this book  It constantly kept my attention and never left me bored  I loved the switching back and forth between the different characters  My favorite character to keep track of was Rachel  I am still slightly confused about Anna and what her true personality is  but I m thinking that if I were to read the book a few more times I might be able to figure her out The one thing that bothered me was that I found quite a few grammar mistakes  I understand that this was written in Europe which has some different rules  but I know that these were mistakes and not just a cultural difference  When I ran across them I became distracted and it interrupted the flow of my reading  However  I was generally able to quickly forgive these mistakes and continue on  I would definitely consider adding this book to my collection   What a page turner  I had to keep reading  couldn t put it down  So addictive   Don t compare it to Gone GirlJust because there s a diary  this is not the same novel Yes  there s also an unreliable narrator but that s where the similarities end God I loved this book  Had me on edge  making theories  not believing  going back for clues  feeling sorry for all women  especially for the girl on the train and how low a person can fall  wondering when would she reach her bottom  The holes in your life are permanent  You have to grow around them  like tree roots around concrete  you mold yourself through the gaps Okay  I get why all the hype Now this is what I call a thriller  I haven t read a good mystery thriller since I ve read Gone Girl  and that was around 8 months ago   so I m glad that changed I ve read somewhere that this was  The Next Gone Girl   and I can t really agree with that  This wasn t as good as Gone Girl  But it was pretty damn close though When it comes to story  I don t wanna give anything away  because I think you should go into this book not knowing anything  I m just gonna say that the whole book was just so dark and twisted  From characters and plot to themes it dealt with  and trust me  this book dealt with some really important themes  If you re a fan of dark books with flawed and fucked up characters  I suggest giving this a go  Just try to go in it with low expectations  just like I did   because high expectations might ruin this book for you  Aaand finally I ve finished this book  In 2 days  eh  It got me hooked throughout  though I was a bit bored at the beginning  Rachel  Man  she s a complete mess and I HATE HER for not realizing that she s a mess   A complete idiot who succumbed to alcohol  Yet  I was curious to see how she handled it as I felt that she had that will somehow to quit drinking  being such an idiot for drinking and messing her own life as well as others around her  She was hopeless   careless  depressed  down  Yet she s the one that got me hooked throughout this book  Hawkins is so brilliant in describing Rachel s depressions  internal pain and feelings  This book has opened more insights about what troubles people have to overcome everyday  that not everyone is perfect or has an awesome  happy life  That we could care more without interfering too much in others  troubles  help people that need it  That we should pay more attention to those around us in our life  Before everything is too late  I decided to give it five stars      I just finished this book last night  I couldn t put it down  In fact  I m really sad that I finished it The basic plot is this  a woman who turns out to be a very unreliable narrators takes the train back and forth to London every day  Every day  the train stops at a certain point and she s able to look into the lives of a couple who live along the tracks  She gives this couple names  a back story  everything  Then one day she sees the wife kissing another man     and you know something bad is going to happen     This is grim stuff   and it s especially harrowing if you ve ever spent a night drinking and couldn t piece together the details of everything you did or said later on   but I absolutely loved it  Stop what you re doing and get this book now   This book is a jewel  The language is deceptively sophisticated  and the characters  all flawed and unlike able to a certain point  were amazingly portrayed  I admire Hawkin s ability to see the world through their eyes  feel their ugly desires  and hear their selfish voices  It s terrifying  but wonderful The hook is also well done  although I actually figured out who was the killer on page 50 and made a bet with my husband  Turned out I was right on the target  But it doesn t make the story lose any appeals  The plot twisted and turned  all the complications were timely thrown out  and readers faced many clues and questions related to the truth of the murder  Well done Highly recommended   Brilliant  I really enjoyed The Girl on the Train  it isn t my usual genre but I m so glad I branched out for this one  As a commuter myself I spend a lot of my time looking out of the window into people s back gardens  and I think that s what makes this such a great novel   it s starts with such a mundane everyday task that every person can relate to but becomes so sinister  After finding out who the real killer was I felt like kicking myself because it seems so obvious and yet the novel was full of suspense that it wasn t an anticlimax  I absolutely loathed Anna  part of me was desperate for Rachel to just smack her smug  middle class face  but in the end I think it was really symbolic that they joined forces   women can put aside their differences when massive tossers are involved  I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants a book so good they almost miss their stop on the train because they can t stop reading    Oh my God    I just finished the book   it was one of those books you can t put down   i see how people compare it to  Gone girl   but the events are faster  I have to admit that the main character was very boring and depressing at first but then i loved her   To say this book is gripping and you won t be able to put it down is an understatement  However  I will be the first to admit that this was nothing like I d expected  not from the synopsis nor the reviews  I bought this book after witnessing all the hype surrounding it and the plot seemed very interesting  albeit a bit vague  enough for me to purchase it  I loved the idea of a girl on the same train every morning and evening  spying on people and creating whole lives for them in her head  I loved the idea of her witnessing something crazy and finding herself in the middle of a thrilling crime  What I didn t expect is that this girl is an irritating alcoholic  who brings nothing but trouble  who is obsessive  and who is honestly  just sickening to read about  I did not expect this girl  spying on people  to be actually spying on the neighborhood where she used to live with her husband Tom  who cheated on her and then left her for that woman  Tom  who now has a child with that woman and is living with his new family in their house  Rachel struck me as unstable with a load of mental issues  Her drinking problem really got on my nerves at one point  but Paula Hawkins still made me want to read on to find out what happened  One mysterious night  Rachel returns to the flat she s sharing with a friend bruised and bleeding  She blacks out  and wakes up the next morning not able to remember anything  All she knows is that the night before she had gotten off the train at the stop where she usually sees the couple she spies on  who she later finds out are called Megan and Scott  but everything after that is erased from her memory  She has an angry voice mail from her ex husband asking her to leave them alone  that she s scaring his wife  Anna  She doesn t know what she s done this time  but is terrified due to the condition she woke up in  When she realizes that Megan has disappeared and the police are interrogating her about her whereabouts the night before  she is even more freaked out and becomes  if possible  even more obsessive  She makes it her mission to try and remember what happened that night and involves herself in everyone s lives  including that of Megan s husband and therapist  A lot of the times she makes things much worse  but sometimes  she comes close to piecing together the missing pieces  We are also given a glimpse into Megan and Anna s lives as they get to narrate their own chapters  We find out what Megan s life was really like with her husband and with her past  and we delve into Anna s insecurities and fears  I can t say I liked any of the characters  male or female  However  I found myself reading on until the very last page unable to pull myself away from the book  For that  I gave it 5 stars  because it takes real skill for an author to be able to suck me in this much despite my loathing for the characters  I can t say I expected more  but I did expect something completely different   Well  I ve read it  And I know what all the fuss is about  This book was just plain fun to read  The ending left me wanting a bit more and I don t love the cover  But everything else  I devoured  It very much has the feel of Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn and Hawkins is every bit as talented as Flynn  There are three different viewpoints of three different women and the switching was never annoying  It only built suspense and kept me turning the pages  I actually sort of loved that our main character was terribly flawed  She is an alcoholic  which makes her a bit unreliable for her point of view  but that didn t bother me  I felt her pain  At times  it was written so well  I actually felt like I knew what it was like to be her  The pain is actually a joy to read  Sick  Maybe  but I just couldn t stop   This was among those books I had seen mentioned so often I knew I needed to read it  I m deep into it and believe I now know who the villain is  I have friends who argue that if you can identify the villain before the reveal  the book  or film  is somehow a failure  I don t think that s true at all  In this case  I find the tribulations and interactions of these sad people painfully compelling  If I had any quibbles  it would be that the whole scenario is just so sad  Such a hopeless picture of marriage and love  so far  at least   I m hoping for something transcendent to emerge from the pain  I will check back in when I m done Done now  This was indeed a compelling read  It was quite classic in structure  Get characters in trouble  then get them deeper into trouble  and just when it looks as if things can t get worse  make sure they do  The pull of this plot structure is even stronger for me when the trouble is at least partly of the character s own making  as was Rachel s  so that turning trouble around requires growth and change  This engagement of characters with their predicaments is what moves me as a reader  and what I miss in puzzle mysteries  I never liked Agatha Christie s flat characters  for example  This book fully engaged me with Rachel  Megan  and Anna  even though sometimes I wanted to give each of them a  gentle  shake As I write more and more reviews  I continue to note that I read as a writer  a practice that I think makes my responses somewhat different than they would be were I strictly a reader  An important scene late in the book spent many pages repeating what I already knew  Part of me said   Okay  I know all this  get on with it   But the writer in me knew  from having been there  that climactic scenes require a certain weight  They have to take up a certain amount of space  And making readers wait is one way of building anticipation  The longer you wait  within certain largely indefinable limits  of course   the more you value the end when you get there  Similarly  at a crucial moment  I found myself wanting to shout   Why don t you do the obvious smart thing   But of course  if the character had done the obvious smart thing  the climactic scene itself would never have happened  Dullsville  And of course  if everybody always did the obvious smart thing all the time  there d be no more stories  would there So I forgive these writerly moves made in the service of story  This is a sad book about sad people  but it is also about a resilience that finally transcends the sadness  A very good read  ExtraordinaryI simply could not put it down  This is an excellent work  all the characters are great  well drawn  Loved it Read via Audible  This was a great book  The plot was intriguing and the the story held my interest from beginning to end  Highly recommend for book clubs  Warning  the ending is pretty fu    up  but WAY better than the ending of Gone Girl  which made me want to pull out my hair and cry over wasting hours of my life reading that damn book    This book read like a movie  The characters  settings  and scenes were so vivid   I could barely put it down  I developed several incorrect theories throughout and fell happily for more than one red herring  Well played  Paula  I hope you keep writing thrillers  This was a fabulous read that had me hooked from page one  I listened to the audiobook and thought the three narrators did a great job  Quite possibly my favourite read of the year  5 5 starsI loved this   so much so that I read it in two days  This book was right up my ally  I enjoy suspense  mystery  and messed up characters more than any other genre Where to begin  The characters were fantastic  As cuckoo as Rachel and Megan were  I could empathize with both of them  I ll never understand why alcohol is so revered when it can cause so much damage   it s an addictive drug  no matter what the companies who produce it say  Rachel truly needed someone to step in and help her  Everyone in her life was enabling her in one way or another  I m glad she pulled herself together in the end   I knew she had it in her  I felt as though I could relate to Megan the most  Not because of the cheating  I could never condone that   but because of how stifled she felt as a housewife  I think I would feel the same way  I ve never wanted that   the house with the white picket fence scenario  I think it would drive me a little crazy too Tom fooled me for the first half or so of the book  I felt slightly sorry for him  because even though he royally messed up  no one deserves a stalker  But then I started to see how he was enabling Rachel   stringing her along  I ve known manipulative people  and it s so hard to see through it  Tom was an expert at it  and luckily he got what was coming to him I loathed Anna  She s the perfect example of the type of person I can t stand   so completely and utterly self absorbed  and convinced that everyone s world should revolve around her child because hers does  Just thinking about her now makes my blood boil Scott was meh for me  I wanted to feel bad for him  but he was a violent brute so  yeah  meh The pacing and the plot were great  I couldn t put it down   I read it at my desk at work  while sitting in the car  everywhere  I enjoyed the different viewpoints and liked that it was kept to the three female characters I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is a fan of suspenseful thrillers  Rachel is a divorced  alcoholic woman who continues to take her commuter train to and from the city even after she is fired from her job  She secretly covets the life of a husband and wife whom she spies every day from the train  When the wife disappears  Rachel thinks something she saw might help solve the case  but when she comes forward  she gets more involved than she had bargained for  Told from the alternating points of views of three women  this psychological thriller is a real page turner  Loved it  Wow  some really screwed up people in this one  You just never know about people do you  And here it goes  yet another book being labelled the next Gone Girl   This is compulsory reading for sure  from page one I simply could not stop reading it  It is that good in my opinion  and to know now that it is the author s first book makes me even more impressed  I m even more awe struck by this book than I was last year by another debut  The Good Girl by Mary Kubica  a book that I highly recommended but know that it was not consensual  There was so twists and turns that my head kept spinning and spinning the entire time  I ended suspecting every single character to be the culprit and no  this time I only realized the WHO and WHY when it was almost too obvious  Everything made sense to me  nothing felt too predictable nor forced which is kind of rare this days So for once believe the hype  this is amazing storytelling  cannot stop reading kind of thriller  suspenseful and exhilarating until the very end  If you like Gillian Flynn and need your next Gone Girl fix look no further   I loved this book  The characters felt so real  The writing was incredible  I loved all of the twists and I wasn t sure at all what was going to happen but it was wonderful  Best thriller I ve read in a while  Creepy  mysterious  fast paced  Definitely recommend to fans of Gillian Flynn or just good books in general   I looked forward to read  The Girl on the Train   the debut novel by Paula Hawkins and I was not disappointed at all Story Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning  Every day she rattles down the track  flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes  and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck  She s even started to feel like she knows them   Jess and Jason   she calls them  Their life  as she sees it  is perfect  Not unlike the life she recently lost And then she sees something shocking  It s only a minute until the train moves on  but it s enough  Now everything s changed  Unable to keep it to herself  Rachel offers what she knows to the police  and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next  as well as in the lives of everyone involved  Has she done more harm than good Rachel is a complex and interesting character and one that is more realistic than many others  She is an alcoholic who isn t able to get over the fact that her ex husband has left her 2 years ago and now lives with his new wife and a daughter in the house the two of lived in when they were married I don t want to justify Rachel s drinking problem  but I understand that it must have been really hard for her to see her ex husband happy with the woman he cheated on her with  And that he still lives in the house the bought together  probably still sleeps in the same bed  but with another woman by his side  this must be difficult for Rachel to deal with I read somewhere  that the story is similar to Gillian Flynn s successful novel Gone Girl  but it only has a couple of similarities The woman Rachel has called Jess is missing  just a day after Rachel saw something from the train that shocked her The police suspects the husband  but he seems innocent That s like the only thing this book has in common with Rachel  if you leave the fact out that none of the characters turns out to be how he or she seems The plot twists were unexpected  the characters changed visible and because of realistic reasons and I liked the portrayal of a broken woman looked for a sense in life The differing points of view were also nice and entertaining  I especially liked that the name of the person from whose perspective the chapter was  stood as a reminder on each page I give 5 of 5 trains for this book  When I think about it  the solution was obvious  but Hawkins has written such a good story around it that made me forget about this
