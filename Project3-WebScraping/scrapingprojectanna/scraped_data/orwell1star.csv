"4",3,"Magdalena Rhinehart","I really wanted to get into this book, it's the third time I've attempted it, but it is just such a labour to read. Wasn't at all as interesting/thought provoking or well written as it's made out to be. I was bored from the start and gave up on it a few times. Really don't understand the hype. "
"6",5,"laura","it was pretty bad, i only got past 100 pages and i quit"
"7",6,"Parents","Read this in high school a hundred years ago. But it was pretty profound. I was very glad when we passed 1984 & our world wasn't anything like that."
"8",7,"Marie Comes","It wasn't really a good novel to read but was a good literature. . If you are searching for a book for pleasure, I beg of you to drop this book and read something else. "
"9",8,"Michael Philippone","I am so sorry. I just can't seem to get into this book. I've tried several times and I make it to about the 25% point only to realize I'm just not invested.Maybe I've been ruined by the more modern books that have grown from the Orwell classic or maybe I'm illiterate and stupid (as I'm no doubt sure all the readers of this review are already thinking). Whatever the case, I believe that for now, at this point in my life, it is not meant to be.I'm sorry Mr. Orwell, I promise I tried.Sincerely,Michael Philippone"
"10",9,"Karman","Many people had recommended this book to me but it was just depressing for me. The torture, the crimes everything.. Just depressing. People might like this book but I didn't. "
"13",12,"Bill Hamilton","I didn't like it in 1975 when I had to read it and all I could think about was the threat of the USSR. I liked it even less after 8 years of ""W"" playing Big Brother. In a world where the Holocaust has been revealed in photos and moving pictures, where the media supplies ongoing evidence of Orwellian societies in existence everywhere, I cannot enjoy reading a book detailing the horrors that are real. "
"14",13,"Markie Weber","hated it!! "
"15",14,"Alexander Bozidarow","не ми хареса!"
"17",16,"Whitley Johns","I didn't like the book 1984 for many reasons. A couple of reasons would be it was a little confusing to follow and I couldn't follow along like i normally do in others books. Another reason would be that it wasn't an interesting book to read full of adventure and mystery like most books have. Lastly, I felt like many parts of the book I was left wondering why that was even apart of the book or passage. Overall, not my favorite book and I wish the district had given us another book to read this summer.Genre: Utopia/dystopia"
"19",18,"Ash S. H.","Honestly?It's a slap in the face to any romance writers out there.But that's just me."
"20",19,"Cajsa","I couldn't even finish this book. I hated the beginning and there was no way I was going to put myself through more misery."
"21",20,"Kanisa Baker","Felt like I had to read this book out of obligation to the classics. But it's just too distressing and lacking in relevance. "
"22",21,"Ysabelle Orillos","Not really a fan of dystopian societies where everything is controlled and everyone is weak. I feel as though it just couldn't happen, especially with the audacity of today's people. 3/5 stars for being unrealistic, and plot lines that are simply difficult to follow. However, my intense dislike for this book may just be because I was forced to read it for my sophomore literature class. Who am I to judge George Orwell?"
"23",22,"Tishangela","A great warning in book form. However I did find it hard to keep reading all of the way through.... there were significant portions where I just wanted to ""get on with it.""I can see why this is a classic, but I cannot imagine re-reading this novel.Worth the read!"
"25",24,"Gaile","Although my husband greatly enjoyed this book and annoyed me for days for talking endlessly about it, I thought it stupid."
"27",26,"Isabel Torres","I am going to go against popular opinion. I simply HATED this bookMaybe it was because it used hard/boring language, or that it took FOREVER for something to happen, or that I was FORCED ti read this in school. Overall its an uneventful book.Yes, I like the main idea of the future society. But i did not like the book.If i could give it 0 stars i would. -Teenage perspective"
"30",29,"Maryam Essam","I was like if there is non stars would gave it non out of five first is he speaking about revolution revolution means people he only mentioned people once does he care about people NO simply teh novvel full of anxious , negativity hatred and giving very bad influence about socialism but finally gave it one out of five for "" hypocrisy and doublethinking if you are doublethinking, you are deliberately forgetting that the contradiction is there. This subtlety is mostly overlooked by people using the accusation of ""doublethink"" when trying to accuse an adversary of being hypocritical."
"31",30,"Gurkmaja","In my opinion the book was not really what I expected it to be. I think the book did not live up to the expectations. Someone told me that the book was about George Orwell who had a thought about what was going to happen in the future. I imagined a book with maybe 200 pages where George Orwell had written down his thoughts. But so was not the case. Instead, Orwell makes a novel about his thoughts. And that novel was not my cup of tea. I just could not enjoy the book. The language was difficult, the setting was a bit unclear and it did not content so much action.The whole story from characters, the action and the author’s choice of words did not fit together. The book did not have that effect which sucks you in to the story and keeps you in a stranglehold. I want breathtaking stories with a lot of drama and emotions. This was just a grey and boring journey through some kind of unexciting future society. No I am really disappointed, I will not remember this book as a good experience and I would never recommend it further to another person. The books gets 1 of 5 stars."
"33",32,"Peter Berg","terrible. bleak and just plain wrong, not even in the way it was meant to be."
"37",36,"Christy Stewart","misogynistic shit"
"38",37,"Heather Sinclair","I rarely dislike a book but I have to say I hated this one. This book was a chore to read."
"40",39,"Crystal Craig","The fact that this book was published and now labeled classic fiction means there is something good about it; what that is I fail to see.One of the four group reads voted in for the month May in my book club, Sweeter Reads; I went into the book with an open mind. Unfortunately, though, I didn't receive that punch in the face I appreciate getting when I start a novel. Yeah, I know, some novels are a little slower to start, but I didn't even get a collar grab, so....... I was bored then, and now at the 35% mark, I'm still bored. It's time to give up. If you read and loved the book, I'd love to know what you liked about it. "
"41",40,"Kieran","If this book had not been a set text for O Level I would never have got beyond page 50."
"43",42,"Tommylord","devo dire che non mi è proprio piaciuto...sono rammaricato"
"44",43,"Eleanor","Imagine living in a world where emotions such as happiness and love are outlawed and thoughts are constantly being monitored. Where your own children will turn you in to be tortured or killed and freedom of speech is totally unheard of. This is the frightening picture that George Orwell portrays as the future in 1984, the story of Winston Smith and his rebellion against a totalitarian government called “Big Brother.” Throughout the story Winston breaks away from government ideals by having an illegal affair with a mechanic named Julia and recording a journal against the ever watchful Big Brother. Although many people find the book to be bleak and depressing, George Orwell’s 1984 proved itself to be a classic because of its ability to cause the reader to question their idea of heroes, society, and symbolism. Probably the biggest reason why 1984 has remained a classic is because of its views about the progression of society. In the book a totalitarian government called the party rules society with an iron fist and an unquenchable thirst for power. “The ideal set-up by the Party was something huge, terrible, and glittering…a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting” (Orwell 64). This government and the power it holds over the minds of its citizens, forces the reader to question whether the progression of human society is a negative or positive thing.	While most may imagine a hero to be someone who is both strong both mentally and physically Orwell challenged this idea by creating Winston Smith, an anti-hero. Unlike the heroes in television and books, Winston is an overweight middle-aged man with a “varicose ulcer above his right ankle” (Orwell 1) and an inability to climb a flight of stairs. And while the thought of someone who can barely climb a set of stairs trying to overthrow an ever-watching totalitarian is somewhat laugh worthy at first, Orwell proves him to be a memorable character. With each and every chapter that passes it becomes easier and easier to relate to Winston and his somewhat flawed character and by the end of the story the reader is able to imagine themselves in Winston’s place fighting for their freedom against Big Brother. 	The last reason for why 1984 still remains popular is because of its use of symbolism. Throughout the story George Orwell uses short songs and rhymes that symbolize the fate of the main characters. When these songs and rhymes are first mentioned in the story they seem insignificant, thus causing the reader to ignore their importance. However after going back over the quotes used by George Orwell in the story it is noticed that they are actually used as tools to foreshadow the fate of the main characters. The best example of this in the book is the short song sung by Mr. Charrington, the Pawn Shop owner. “Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St. Clement’s…Here comes a candle to light you to bed, Here comes a chopper to chop off your head” (Orwell 83). At first glance this quote is insignificant but later reveals itself to foreshadow the fate of Winston and Julia, the main characters. 	Although at times dark, George Orwell’s 1984 proved itself to be a classic because of its ability to cause the reader to question their idea of heroes, society, and symbolism. For those that enjoy dystopian or just interesting books in general I would definitely recommend it. "
"45",44,"Jaime","Absolutely HATE this book!!! Definitely traumatized me!"
"46",45,"Laurie","The reviews were right. It is one of the most depressing books, that I have read. The message wasn't as clear in 1984. In Ann Rand books the message is clear. I like the Ann Rand books better."
"47",46,"Rachael MacLean","While I respect this book for its literary merit and what it's trying to say, I found it to be a slog and the book within the book was worse. I wasn't a huge fan. "
"49",48,"Paige Hoke","Horrible book!"
"51",50,"John Bednarczyk","One of the worst books I've ever read. I constantly found myself loosing focus on the idea at hand.. this is probably the most mundane book I have ever picked up. On the other hand, this book brings up an interesting philosophy that the past can be altered to control the future? just weird....."
"52",51,"Thomas","If you're considering reading this book please note that it contains graphic thoughts of rape, self harm/suicide and torture. You have almost certainly encountered some of the language invented in this book in your daily life and not realised it. It must have been a game changer on many fronts.Unfortunately time dulls political satire; the use of the word comrade doesn't strike fear into my Russian-hating heart (note: I do not hate Russians), even when paired with communism that denies people such things as sugar and lemons.At the beginning during HATE WEEK Winston fantasies about raping a young girl and then killing her, which is pretty fucked up. Seriously, what the fuck, Winston. He ends up dating her, which is illegal (because the party don't like people touching each other) and also fucked up because she reacted to the line ""I wanted to rape and murder you"" with ""cool, let's get naked"".They faff about for a good while not really doing much more than talk about murder and how this girl (Julia; I'm surprised the younger generation doesn't have Russian sounding names) wants to get a real woman's dress and wear makeup, which makes me wonder if George Orwell was afraid of feminism as well and readily brought into the idea that all feminists are butch man haters, and that real women(tm) are unafraid of men who want to murder them.It isn't until half-way through the book that someone comes in to give them a purpose. They get a book, which leads to an obscenely long chapter of them reading. This book mentions that there is no racial discrimination right before going on to describe people as ""Jews, Negroes, South Americans of pure Indian blood"" which, uh, doesn't strike me as post racial, per se. It turns out that the book ruse was a distraction because, lo and behold, their purpose is ripped away from them before anything interesting happens. There's a lot in the way of torture scenes and I cared about none of it, because I couldn't forge the slightest connection to Winston. The book on a desolate note - something I'm all for, especially in this type of story - but the only thing I cared about was that, in terms of the 1984 universe, absolutely nothing happened."
"53",52,"Meenu","I'm sorry but this book was one of the worst I've ever read..."
"55",54,"Halima","I did not enjoy this book at all. Read like 30 pages and couldn't get past it at all. "
"56",55,"Gayle","In 1960, this was a frightening look at the future, but seemed so far away. Next thing I knew, it was the real 1984 and Big Brother was only a reality in places like the Soviet Union."
"57",56,"Carly","So thought provoking! It could have been a great book except for the overuse of unnecessary sexual content. Nothing graphic at all but still all throughout and mentioned frequently. That alone skewed my whole opinion of the book. "
"58",57,"Ericka 'carlson' tucker","I thought this was one of the top most boring books after getting to the middle. Did not finish it. It just dragged on."
"60",59,"Brandi Arwood","I cannot get through the ending of this book. I hate leaving a book unfinished but this has happened three times, years apart. Not for me, I guess."
"64",63,"Brooke West","Words cannot convey how much I hated this book. I expected something to happen, but it took the last 75 pages to even become remotely interesting. All he did was complain about the Party, then when he was caught he complained EVEN THOUGH HE SPENT THE WHOLE BOOK SAYING HE WOULD BE CAUGHT. Surprise surprise. This should have just been a short story. I realize what the point of the novel was, only because Orwell kept bashing me over the head with it. "
"65",64,"Dylan Ryland","I did not really like the book too much. The book was sort of gloomy and just did not appeal to me. I would recommend the book just because I would want to see what other people thought of it. At the time it was written it could have seemed that the book could have actually come true and the things happening in the book could have actually happen, but they did not happen. The book is just boring to me not enough cool stuff and stuff that I could really relate to and see happening in real life situations. I only like books I can really relate to and this just is not a book I can see that with."
"66",65,"Suzanne","OK, I finally got around to reading this. It kept popping up in reccomendation lists because of the type of book I usually enjoy. But I just don't understand what all the fuss is about with this book? It was incredibly dull and I didn't like the main charactor at all. I feel a little guilty for my rating because I know how much people love this book, but it just wasn't for me. Excellent ideas of course, especially considering when it was written. I just didn't enjoy reading it."
"68",67,"Sandy","Couldn't finish it. Too depressing and awful to imagine. Plus I read a review and found out what's coming up and didn't want to deal with that either. "
"74",73,"Jason Roth","Tried hard to read this but couldn't get through the first third. Probably the most boring book I ever tried to read. The characters and the setting are incredibly bleak and boring. Absolutely nothing kept my interest. I guess that was sort of Orwell's point to show how beaten down everyone is by the government, but I found nothing entertaining while reading this. Huge waste of time."
"77",76,"Alannahkennedy","This was a horrible book."
"79",78,"Mahmoud Ali","great novel .... all what i can say"
"81",80,"Moriah Cena","It is mind-bogglingly and brilliantly eye-opening (pun intended), I just can't decide if I despise the ending because he conformed, or love it because it's the type of heart-wrenching, anger-inducing full stop to a mind-numbing piece of literature. The former was only chosen for a change."
"84",83,"Chris Graham","[Note: I give this one star not because it was a crappy book, but because I just could not get into it. One star means ""did not like it"" on this site, not ""this book was horrible."" Big difference, and I recognize that, so don't go saying I'm an idiot or something.] Alright, the plot of any book or movie generally needs to start around the end of the first third of it; 1984's plot did not begin until the halfway point was reached. Maybe the second half of the book was better, but I wouldn't know because that's where I stopped. I was annoyed that I read half of it and still nothing of interest had yet begun. I was also pretty confused during most parts of it, but that's probably just because I'm not used to Orwell's writing style. I think the reason so many people love this book is because they think they're ""supposed"" to love it. It's a ""classic,"" as they say. People love to agree with brilliant critics and analysts because it makes them think they themselves are brilliant as well. But just because a book or movie has a cool idea to it (as in this book's case) doesn't mean that that idea was portrayed and executed well. I did enjoy ""Animal Farm,"" though."
"87",86,"Kitty Kate","I read like 300/320 pages but i couldn't finish it. I loved the part were they were together and the conspiracy but that was all. All the turning around, the double agents, got me confused."
"89",88,"Kristin Whitcomb","I just couldn't get into this book no matter how hard I tried. I know it's considered one of those books you must read before you die, well luckily I have years of my life left to possibly pick up this bland awkward book again. Hats off to those of you who made it through."
"90",89,"Nievie","Man pants. next."
"92",91,"Vonnie","I listened to this book. I do not think I would have finished this book if I was reading it. I will admit there was an element of curiosity pushing me to finish, that element was overwhelmed with thoughts of ""Will this book ever end."" My 15 year old granddaughter was assigned to read this book, which seems more like cruel and unusual punishment for that age group. "
"93",92,"Charles Shires","Wouldn't even wipe my arse with this. Utter drivel "
"97",96,"Tamiya Shane","i know it is a classic but i did not like it and did not even read it all"
"98",97,"alistair pott","Thought provoking but miserable. It was a bit of a pain to read. That said, I highly recommend reading this book because a lot of what is covered has become part of our culture.It's important to know what they are talking about when people mention thought police, doublethink, etc"
"101",100,"Olivia","it was ok it was a little too creepy for my taste but if you like creepy scary things it is a good book for you"
"102",101,"Kenzie","Oh....BORING!! I couldn't make it through this one. I don't ditch too many books, but this was one I did."
"103",102,"Xanblank","What I learned? I learned that this book is unbelievably depressing and that I never want to read it again. I guess you could call it a classic and it does have an interesting message but, man, way to make a person feel like crap about the world. "
"106",105,"Nativeabuse","Honestly an ok book, but the damage this has done to the socialist movement makes me sick. It was basically instrumental in creating the stupid illusion that Communism= Totalitarian.To everyone out there that thinks this is the case, try reading some actual marx sometime, even a few lines of it and you will realize this is not the case. On another note Orwell was a socialist himself and actually fought on the side of Communists and Anarchists in the Spanish Civil war. He wrote an entire book about it. "
"107",106,"Rafael Vianna valadares araujo","After nearly a month of basically forcing myself to finish this book, I gotta say I expected more... WAY moreI wanted to give it more than this 1 star review, but the book simply did not meet my expectations at all.Spoiler alert from here on, be warned.While I expected a good story, I feel that all I got was a long description book, with a main character that could be simply removed completely, as he fails to accomplish anything other than provide a way for the narrator to describe the social and political surroundings. I kept expecting something to happen that could at least change the status quo of that society, so that the book would at least become a narrative of a society being transformed, but that change never came. The world ends as it started, and although it can be argued that the main character himself had a transformation at the end, it is done in such a way that it does not feel as if it happened at all.You get to finish your reading experience with a feeling that you just read a sociology textbook written on the 50's. While there is nothing wrong with that, it is not what I expected when I set out to read a fiction novel."
"112",111,"Elysia","I have no idea why everybody loves this book so much. It's full of cliches and it's foreshadowed like a mofo. The ending SUCKS. It's horrible, and bleak. In the end, what I got from this book: Resistance is futile. Just go with the crowd and keep your head down to avoid trouble.I waited 27 years to read this book, and when I closed it I was angry at the book for wasting that much of my life, even if it only was a few hours. I have no idea why people like Orwell so much."
"113",112,"Chance Holt","I didnt like this book because it wasnt very interesting.The book was not a great topic,the language the book was written it wasnt very good.It didnt keep my attention i dont recommend this book."
"114",113,"Kenny Telfer","I know you shouldn't slate a classic, but... I'm not big on politics so this was a poor choice for me to read. the first half is about politics, and the second about torture. I'll stick to my modern day warfare stories from Afghanistan thanks...wait a minute!"
"115",114,"Jenn","I am sorry to say this book bored me so much, that I couldn't finish it."
"116",115,"Benny","I had to stop 12 pages in because i thought it was boring!"
"118",117,"Lyndsay","Okay. I know this is a classic and I see why it is, but let's cut the crap and call a spade a spade- it's BORING!!"
"119",118,"Φαροφύλακας","Προσωπικά δεν μπόρεσα να το τελειώσω αυτό το βιβλίο. Βέβαια, η ανάγνωση ξεκινούσε μ' ένα μεγάλο ντεσαβαντάζ: το βιβλίο υποφέρει εκ των πραγμάτων από το φαινόμενο του παρωχημένου μέλλοντος* που για τα δικά μου γούστα είναι ένας μεγάλος ανασταλτικός παράγοντας.* δηλ. περιγράφει ένα μέλλον το οποίο παρήλθε και δεν είναι πλέον πειστικό.Επιπλέον, ακόμα και η φοβία προς τον κομουνιστικό ολοκληρωτισμό είναι μάλλον παρωχημένη. Από εκεί και πέρα η δυστοπία που περιγράφεται είναι τόσο ακραία που στα δικά μου μάτια μοιάζει με καρικατούρα. Ίσως εάν υπήρχαν κάποια άλλα στοιχεία να μπορούσε η ιστορία να ζωντανέψει και να γίνει πειστική κι ενδιαφέρουσα αλλά εγώ δεν μπόρεσα, δυστυχώς, να βρω κάτι που να εκτιμήσω.Άρχισα να πηδάω σελίδες εκεί που ο Σμιθ διαβάζει ""το βιβλίο"" γιατί το περιεχόμενό του μου φάνηκε σαν ένα αδιάφορο κατεβατό (αφού περιέγραφε μια υποτιθέμενη αλήθεια για έναν κόσμο που δεν με πείθει). Προσπάθησα να συνεχίσω να διαβάζω για την σύλληψή του κτλ. αλλά το βιβλίο με είχε χάσει παντελώς πια και το είχα χάσει και μοναχά καταπιεζόμουνα. Έτσι το άφησα και μόλις έψαξα και διάβασα το υπόλοιπο σε περίληψη ώστε να γνωρίζω έστω το τέλος μιας και μπήκα σε τέτοιον κόπο.Η δική μου προσωπική εκτίμηση δίχως να θέλω να προσβάλω κανέναν.[ πρώτη δημοσίευση στην Λέσχη του Βιβλίου ]"

"124",123,"John Christy","This is a boring polemic that provides absolutely no insight into actually existing models of state repression.

"129",128,"Kelly B","Another book assigned in high school. I suppose it's important that we read this book, but at the time I thought it was annoying and fucking depressing as hell. What a claustrophobic life. "
"130",129,"Lorna","It was assigned reading in high school and it was analyzed to death. I couldn't wait for the torture to end. Sorry I didn't read it with an open mind."
"133",132,"Elena =P","I did not like this book at all. What I did not like about it was that you could hear the author's thoughts while you were reading the book. This might sound weird but I could really imagine the author doing the things that the character ""Goldstein"" did or parts that he wrote in ""the book"". I do not like books like this one where you hear the author's voice in the back of your head. I would much rather read a book where you did not even know there was an author at all. But that's just a thought of mine.The plot also was very confusing and sometimes I had to go back a few pages and read them again so I could actually understand what character it was about. Once or twice, I even got so bored from the book that I read it while thinking about something completely different which was not too smart because then I had to read them again :)The one and I think only thing I liked about the book was that the things that the author predicted, like the telescreens, actually happened or are available to buy today. That I thought was kind of funny but also a little creepy..."
"137",136,"Kayla Enfield","I didn't enjoy reading this book whatsoever. It was long and extremely confusing. The characters had split personalities that I couldn't keep up with. I don't normally read books that are like '1984'. This was the only Dystopian book that I have not liked reading."
"139",138,"Chris Naber","This was one of the most boring books i have ever read. This book was mostly about Winston walking around and complaining that the government he lived under was oppressive. This utopia/dystopia book was nothing but boring and long complaints about stuff that didn't matter because the author gives away that no one can win against the party early off in the beginning of the book. I would never recommend this book to anyone except those i hate. "
"141",140,"Elisha","I wanted to like this, I really did, but I hated it. I may try it again at a new phase of life and see if I've changed my mind. It was interesting, but awful."
"142",141,"Jamie Lee","I give this book one star because I personally didn’t like this book at all. I felt like it moved too slowly. It was back and forth between love and hate and was mostly facts and not entertaining."
"153",152,"Robert","No...just no."
"154",153,"Michelle Llewellyn","The setting is London. Not that it matters. Oceania is Utopia or Panem or the Community. It is a dystopia and the story is told in third person limited, entirely from the point of view of Winston Smith. As boring and ordinary a fictional protagonist we could ask for. He is a true everyman, doing his best to muddle through each day as dictated by the supreme will of his superiors. He has a job, one meal a day and a roof over his head. Nobody questions the traditional family unit in this futuristic setting. Women have no real role except as baby makers, laundresses and exercise instructors. Nobody questions anything.For a true appreciation of 1984, watch Star Trek, TNG S6:E10-11, ""Chain of Command"" That's the way this story should've been told. There are twenty-four chapters divided into three parts for a total of 298 pages. The plot is slow to develop. Orwell spends the first ten chapters introducing Winston, setting up his world and letting us follow him around so we can truly understand just how lucky we are to have the internet, the sexual revolution and to live in the information age that Orwell could never have foreseen. In a world where everyone shares their most intimate activities and tattles on each other daily, ""Big Brother is Watching"" has become laughingly obsolete. We are Big Brother. Winston's sexual partner, Julia, is the true martyr of this political propaganda tale. She does everything for Winston: initiates the relationship, provides their first meeting place, pretties herself up for him, encourages him to rebel against Big Brother, brings him gifts like black market sugar, coffee and bread. And what does Winston do for her in return? Not much besides curing Julia of insomnia by reading aloud to her and giving them a false sense of security which ultimately betrays them thanks to Winston's complete lack of character judgment. The ability of The Party to torture and destroy a man in a quest for ultimate power is insignificant next to a man and woman's ability to create life. Since Winston never cared about his ability to procreate with his first wife and cared even less if Julia was using contraceptives and O'Brian never used sexual abuse on Winston during the torture chapters, 1984 is laughingly outdated indeed. What is the worst torture you could imagine? What is in Room 101? Besides being forced to listen to a complete recitation of The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism for any single, never married woman living in Utah, Room 101 is an LDS singles ward. "
"156",155,"Tashiya Ballentine","Personally I thought that 1984 was boring. The book starts of slow and ends boring. The only interesing part of the whole book was when Winston's face was eaten by rats. What I didnt like most about that book was that it mostly talked about some language called doublethink and it made me even more confused."
"158",157,"Nick","Read about 60 pages and couldn't get into it. In my opinion it was just boring and a bit too far ""out there."" Not what I expected at all"
"160",159,"Jude Liebermann","What can I say about this book, besides boring? Had to read it for high school, and the movie was just as bad."
"161",160,"Kelsi","This is closer to a 1.5 stars for me. The first 2/3 of the book was incredibly boring, and the last 1/3 had some action but didn't save the book. I never really grew attached to any of the characters and didn't enjoy the plot of the novel. This was a required reading for school so I had to power through. I was disappointed because I LOVED Animal Farm, but in my opinion this book fell really short in all aspects."

"164",163,"Breanne","My friend recommended this book to me and i honestly had to force myself through this horribly boring book, not being able to finish it. The concept of Big Brother and this time period is quite interesting. Had the main character been relatable and less weird, i probably would have enjoyed it."
"165",164,"Nicholas Luu","This is one of the most pretentious novels ever written. Anyone with half a brain could see the down side of a government that's too powerful and such but every teacher seems to love this book and views George Orwell as an oracle. there isn't even any likable characters which would be fine if they were relatable but no, I don't relate to any character. The book is way to political it keeps on shoving it's message down my throat. I fucking hate this book. It's a bland, pretentious, and just plain boring book"

"184",183,"Shiloh Burt","I had to read this book for a class. I enjoyed it when Orwell would paint the big picture and describe how everything was in the future, however, he often got too carried away with describing unnecessary details. It got boring especially when you got to about the middle of the book and had to read a book within a book. If you are looking for a book to make you think and cause you to question society and the human race, this book is for you. If not, this read will do no more than that."
"185",184,"Priya","God I hated this book! I'm not a distopia person and I just thought it was so boring. Nothing exciting happens. I understand so many more references now in life but that's the only reason I recommend anyone read it."
"187",186,"Anastassiya","As difficult as it may be to criticise a book of such immense popularity, I shall sheepishly do so nonetheless.I did not find the inner world of characters convincing at all. This novel, much like the Handmaid's Tale misses the strength of human soul...Under severe conditions people become stronger inside, all sort of things might happen on the outside, but the inner world is there and feeling of love and affection become sharper in the same way life gets sharper for those who know they have only a few years left to live. Here the characters are too bland and robotic, the author does not speak from experience but has this paranoid fantasises...If one writes about suffering for the book to be good it has to come from personal experience and Dostoevsky does that exceptionally well. If it is a science fiction book then one has to have a much better plot than Orwell demonstrates in 1984...Read the good soldier Sveik which is a historical account of the times when people had to think in a certain way and when they could be killed from saying one word wrong. Watch WestEast with Katherine Deneuve, set in a time of Stalinist repressions which shows that despite all the oppression people do not lose their souls...The purpose of this book as I see it is to scare..."

"202",201,"Jake Parrett","This novel pulled wires in my head that did not need pulled. It tested the limits of my intelligence. 1984 was very pleasingly deep and was very appropriate for the time of its publishing. After the end of WWII, countless countries wanted and needed to adopt a new system of government. Orwell shunned the idea of totalitarianism and fancied the idea of a socialism. "
"204",203,"Toni ","I had never read 1984 by George Orwell before now. Winston Smith is the protagonist who spends most of his time throughout the novel trying to overthrow The Party and Big Brother while running from the “Thought Police” a justice department that monitors the citizens of Oceana. Everywhere Winston goes he feels that he is being watched by Big Brother. However, Winston fails in his attempts and is captured by the people that he thought was his friends and is later brainwashed into loving and following Big Brother. I found this book difficult to follow however, Orwell leaves readers with a sense of hopelessness concerning the government. "

I tried reading it in eBook format, in paperback format, and even listening to the audio. In the end I ended up just skimming through it to get the general gist of what happened.I never really felt like I got to know the characters. In some ways I did, but mainly I didn't. They were somewhat extreme, but not exactly likable. I'm not sure why, but I just didn't care about them. As far as the plot goes, it was strange and never really made sense. I know it's a social commentary, but I felt like there was too much going on to really understand all the nuances about it.While I love some classics, this did not fall into the category. I'm sure many people love it and even though I didn't like it I would still recommend it. Different people may get different things out of it and it is definitely a good book to discuss.-----This review and more on my blog Listful Booking."

It is really thought-provoking and interesting when compared to our modern world. At first glance, the two may not seem so similar, but if you really think about it, it just may be. I though it was really well written, I had no trouble understanding his language and it was easy to get through. I found that I was forcing myself to read it, and it took longer for me to finish than it would have if I enjoyed that style. I just have no interest in dystopian literature. I thought it was a cool and well though-out world that Orwell created, I was just not all that interested in it."

Не разбирам защо бе толкова наложително и съществено да прочета тази книга, след като не ми остави нито една положителна емоция. Това е сигурно най-натоварващата книга, с която съм имала досег до сега. Уж измисленият свят в произведението, всъщност е същия като нашия, но по-пресилен, по-ужасен, по-безчовечен, по-агресивен. Съпоставяйки ""1984"" с ""451 градуса по Фаренхайт"" мога да открия множество прилики. И на двете места героите търсят свободата, искат да излязат от рамките на общоприетите вярвания и закономерности. А какво получават накрая? Вярно, че за единият завършекът е много по-пагубен от този на другия. Защото е смешно да си изтърпял толкова много и накрая да склониш глава, да се предадеш, да отхвърлиш собствените си убеждения.Тази книга може да бъде както гениална, така и изключително опасна в неподходящи ръце. Надявам се каквото и да става със света, да не бъде като описаното в книгата.

Seperti yang saya baca pada beberapa review di goodreads, 1984 memang essay yang bagus. Namun saya mengharapkan sesuatu yang lain. Lebih banyak aksi. Buku ini kebanyakan ilustrasinya, menggambarkan kediktatoran partai dan kefanatikan anggotanya, namun dialognya sedikit. Selain cerita yang membuat mata saya mengantuk, gaya penerjemahannya juga kurang enak dibaca. Banyak kata kata yang menurut saya kurang pas atau sulit dimengerti, seperti membikin, baheula, laik, dan bahasa newspeak seperti sosing, kejatkiran.

"252",251,"Chelsea Waddell","In the book 1984, George Orwell was writing around the time of 1948 which is around the time after world war II and the cold war period. I think that Orwell was trying to warn all of the world what could happen if something wasn't done about the spread of communism. So he wrote this book 36 years into the future. Everything was watched what you did what you thought even a twitch of your face could give you away to the ""thought police"". Winston the main character in this story was a man who was against the ""party"". The party which was under the rule of Big Brother was a horrific thing. Their goals were for children to turn against their parents and turn people against sex and relationships with people they wanted all you attention focused on Big Brother and the party. But, foolish Winston rebeled anyway. The rebel was brought about by the beginning of an affair with a woman he met named Julia. They began having secret meetings that involved sex, coffee, tea, and bread (all illegal things). But their fun was shortlived because little did they know the thought police had been keeping a close eye on Winston for seven years. After they captured Winston he was tortured into believing the lies of the party like 2+2=4. He was eventually shot his final thoughts being ""I love Big Brother"". This book was not my favorite. Many of the parts were very slow moving and hard to follow. I would recommend it to people who are really into history and communism and all that good stuff..."
"253",252,"Allegra Hailey Green","Oh dear. After hearing Big Brother references my whole life I wanted to read this book and understand why it was so important to society. I definitely did not expect that it would contain so much sex (though I guess if you wanted to control the world sex would be a good place to start?), when the government told him ""we shall abolish the orgasm"" I'm pretty sure I laughed until I cried (this was not supposed to be funny). The dystopian concept is interesting, but a lot of other authors have explored this type of society with more success in storytelling. I know this is a political novel, but if you're not studying politics don't read it. There is about 30 pages that does nothing other than dryly explain their whole political system. I got his point, I understood why the book has important historical value (warning against communism) but I really think it's out of touch now. "

Esta claro el mensaje que quiere aportar, y ese mensaje te lo explica muy claramente y no da lugar a dudas, pero no es mas que su visión de un posible futuro corrupto.De las tres partes que tiene el libro me quedo con la primera mitad de la primera, las primeras páginas de la segunda y algo de la tercera.

One of the grossest lies ever forced on the American people, what a great line. Strangely, however, I find this is also a fitting description of George Orwell's 1984.I don't understand how a book this awful managed to force itself so successfully on the English-speaking/reading public. This is a truly terrible book. The crux of the story is a prolonged torture sequence, which Orwell uses as proof to show that torture and totalitarian societies can make people think whatever they want, and also, strangely, mirrors Orwell's strategy of storyteller: namely, bashing his reader over the head with the same dumb points continuously until they have no choice but to agree with him. Of course if this was the conclusion Orwell wanted his reader to arrive at I'd buy him a beer and take everything back, but I don't think that was Orwell's thought process. My sense is that Orwell was a good man who genuinely cared about humanity, but I think it's also fair to say he was an idiot. At this point, I mean. I mean it's thirty years after 1984 and seventy-five years since the book was published, and clearly the world Orwell described just didn't happen. But on top of this, Orwell himself admitted that he misinterpreted certain events during WWII, essentially saying that he confused the collapse of the British Empire with a revolution and the end of society. I mean, alright, there's plenty of problems with our current system of government, but when is it that we can all agree Orwell GOT IT WRONG, because he really did. A lot of people are talking about this recent NSA spying controversy and talking about how this proves Orwell right. I'm not saying what the NSA was doing was right, because it wasn't, but my general opinion is that anyone who says the NSA IS BIG BROTHER, ABSOLUTELY WORD FOR WORD, BIG BROTHER, is hysterical, a clown and probably never read 1984 because aside from the monitoring and data collection, there are real significant differences between 1984 Orwell society and the modern day NSA.To give Orwell credit I don't think he wrote a very good prophecy for the future, but how an individual living in a highly technologically advanced society might feel. But in that case why didn't he just set the story in Soviet era Russia or East Germany. That might've been an interesting story. My sense is that the reason Orwell didn't set the story in Russia or East Germany was that he didn't want to or was incapable of doing any research.Altogether, a shoddy, lackadaisical, lazy exercise in fiction writing.Seriously, grow up people, find a new dystopia novel. Orwell got it wrong, plain and simple. "
"274",273,"Martin","	I Live in the Real WorldCan you recall an occasion when you’ve heard this said in good faith? without a superadded tone of belligerent outrage to boot? Whenever I hear that tone of aggressive don’t-you-tell-me! moral indignation, I know I’m hearing a vocal mask of bad conscience—hear it in my own voice I know it’s time to rethink seriously whatever I’ve just said.	A few years back I wrote to a National Post columnist about what I thought was a rather bizarre contention: that the trial and execution of Saddam Hussein was a triumph of natural justice. Her reply turned on that sentence: “I live in the real world”—a world, apparently, in which natural justice can embrace the assassination of three consecutive defence attorneys—no doubt to encourage the fourth—and, in general, trial proceedings that—I kid you not, look up the news reports of the time if you don’t believe me—resembled nothing so much as those of the Red Queen’s court in Alice in Wonderland. Apparently we’ve been wrong about Lewis Carroll all this time; he was actually a naturalist in the manner of Emile Zola.	Of course Lewis Carroll was writing about the real world—aspects of it I should say, that’s all any of us can claim—telling the truth but telling it slant as Emily Dickinson put it. Thought I don’t think the word totalitarian had been coined yet, the court of the Red Queen strikes me as a far more astute vision of totalitarianism than George Orwell’s 1984. Orwell imagines a middle level bureaucrat like O’Brien could be a philosopher prince—or is forced to pretend he does, since otherwise he can’t get out the reams and reams of argument he has to fall back on, lacking the skill to show the intricate apparatus of totalitarianism—instead he has to turn a character into his mouthpiece, improbably and at whew! length, so he can tell tell tell you what he thinks. It’s what happens when you send an impatient schoolmaster to do a novelist’s job (and his fervid misrepresentation of Gulliver’s Travels shows he was equally as capable a misreader of novels).	None of the attendants at the Red Queen’s court pauses in frenzied action to give a solemn exposition of its inner workings at a hundred pages’ length—the chop logic they speak very frequently conveys sense (hidden from themselves), but their words don’t explain the social order—they reveal it. So do their actions—principally variations of running around like chickens with their heads cut off, mainly in the devout hope that they can thereby prevent their actual heads from being, you know, actually cut off. Motions of that kind—paranoid, frenetic, scrabbling—are constant in Stalin’s Russia as well—from the lowest level at its outer to the highest level at its inner circle. A middle manager like O’Brien in such a maelstrom will have little time to concentrate his thoughts , what with the huge proportion of every working day and restless sleeping night that must be given over to metaphorically, and on some occasions perhaps literally (state occasions I’d be inclined to say, but that may be editorializing) pissing his pants with fear.	The curious thing about the columnist who argued the Red Queen’s court was an admirable model of natural justice is that she’s interesting and provocative—on the euthanasia movement, feminism and men’s rights, the rising tide of anti-semitism in polite society and (perhaps most worrying) public schools—whenever she engages with the world around her. Her occasional book reviews are a delight—where the subject isn’t overtly political—because she has far more practical aesthetic sense than most professional reviewers. It’s only when alarmist tendencies send her back to the entrenched redoubt of living in the real world that she ever talks solemn nonsense, as in a recent column commending realists (rightists) and savaging dreamers (leftists) in our society for their respective views on militant Islam. Apart from the fact that it was right-wing realists whose dream of miring the Soviet Union in Afghanistan precipitated the exponential leap forward in power and militancy of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, this is a classic example of an either /or question—“Are you a realist or a dreamer?”—that can only be coherently answered “Yes”. It’s possible to criticize a particular dream on any number of counts—it’s wishy-washy; too aggressively self-centred; so unfocussed it has no centre at all; seems high sounding and noble but would lead in practice to self-replicating (self-exploding) nightmares—but it’s pointless to criticize (or praise) anyone for being a dreamer if it’s impossible to discover a single example of a human being who isn’t."

"287",286,"Lucia González ","I did not like this book at all. I suppose it was the insane sexism that fills the whole novel and that just wouldn't let me enjoy it, but it may also have been the fact that I found it so boring that I struggled to finish it. I get Orwell's idea, I get that it was written in the 40's but I just don't get why so many people love this book. It starts ok but then you have 40 pages of Goldstein's book that take you out of the novel completely and then it ends. But yeah, my main problem with this novel is that the sexism was both hidden and in plain view, I just can't enjoy a book that is so full of hate against women, I can't. "
"289",288,"Claire Walt","I just couldn't get into this book. I found it to be rather dull and boring."
"290",289,"Sean","1984, by George Orwell, was a tough read for me. I'm not sure whether I was born too late to relate to the language of Orwell's time period; or if I came to it with high expectations, following Christpher Hitchens frequent praise of Orwell's work. Whatever it was, I hate this novel and early on it became a real chore to read. I spent the majority of the novel telling myself, “One more chapter and it will pick up. One more chapter and it will be worth it,” yet it never did pick up and I finished it sorely disappointed. The torture scenes at the end of the book paled in comparison to the torture the author made me go through. I just wanted to call it quits but persevered out of my own stubbornness.In short: the book is slow, painstakingly so; The characters are boring; the dialogue is fleeting and mind-numbingly pointless when it does make an appearance; the ending is unsatisfactory. The book is more of a statement than a story; a good example of why an idea by itself doesn't guarantee a good read. Safe to say this has firmly put me off reading any other books by this author. Don't trust any five star reviews like I did. Reviewers are either just beginning to venture into the world literature and are yet to strike gold, or they think classics can do no wrong and deserves a higher rating.Would not recommend."
"291",290,"Quinn","If you want to find another reason to lose hope and fall into a deep depression- please! Read this book. I can't understand why so many radicals love this depressing and bleak distopian vision.

Which, in a perverse way, goes to show how well done the book is- if it was badly done, I would likely just feel ambivalent at the end. I actually probably ought to give this book more stars, simply for the fact that it caused me to hate it so thoroughly- just as I'm sure I'm meant to- but then that would imply that I actually like the book, which I don't.

"323",322,"Lizzie","Wonderful idea, horrible layout."
"324",323,"Keshav","For all the hype around this book, it's terrible. It's the classic case of a brilliant storyteller and great satirist [I'm talking, of-course, of Animal Farm] gone horribly wrong because he wanted to air a grandly idiotic philosophical/behavioral pet-theory. Instead of a plot you have meaningless discourses of some sort of post-capitalistic balderdash. Do not recommend. "
"326",325,"Drew","A cautionary tale to be taken to heart but it was a dreadful book. The story doesn’t go anywhere, the characters aren’t likable and at points it just drags on. I get it question everything, but wasn’t there an interesting way that the author could convey it? At one point Winston is reading a book about the current socio-economic which added nothing to the story. If you’re looking for an indictment of war, communism or the man this is your book. If you want something interesting just pass on this one."

"333",332,"Alisa","To be completely honest...I did not finish this book! I got through the first few chapters and couldn't keep my attention in it. It was long, wordy, and too much detail that I didn't feel was important. I also couldn't sense a progression of plot. I felt that if I have time to actually sit down and read something, I'd want it to be something I actually enjoy reading. So, I'll have to pick this up much much later in life."

"338",337,"Rorshach Sridhar","As I've made it clear, I hate dystopian novels, though 1984 is certainly the best one I've read (as of now). It begins very promising with a character that actually has human emotions, but rather than the novel consist of political commentary on the real world (which is what it aims to do) Orwell instead turns it into a lust-based love story with only ideas about the future state of the freedom of speech and press fully fleshed-out. Every other theme is half-baked, including its origins."
"341",340,"Julesmarie","This book single-handedly destroyed my ability to read books without knowing the ending in advance. I can't remember ever hating a book as much as I hated this one (which, I suppose, is an indication of how good it was). I just felt so horribly betrayed by the ending.I was a freshman in college when I read it and (view spoiler)[ when the character I'd been becoming attached to and rooting for turns his back on everything and gives in (hide spoiler)] I felt angry and hurt and betrayed enough that I literally threw the book across the room and collapsed in sobs. (I never claimed to not be overly-dramatic...)I understand the purpose behind that ending, and the book itself has led me to a fascination with dystopian novels, but I honestly HATED this. SO much.Perhaps with a re-read I might change my mind, but I can't get over the feeling of betrayal enough (even after 15 years) to be willing to give a re-read a shot."
"342",341,"Shilo","This book seemed like it would be perfect for me. I did not finish this book. The beginning was a bit rough. It was interesting to me that the character started to fight the man. Halfway through I knew how it would end and I was aghast. I wanted to be wrong. I rarely did this, but I flipped to the last chapter. I was disappointed by guessing where the story ended. "

However, there is so much political commentary (including a 30-page essay) that is occasionally thought-provoking but primarily tedious. The book feels outdated and only tangentally related to contemporary society."

"370",369,"Mary Alice","This book that scared me in the sixties seems no more than bleak today. 1984 may have been prophetic when it came out in 1949, but not one single prediction has come true. And it is really no more than a science fiction novel, not even based on real science. It was hard to read through the torture sections and to see the many, many human beings who didn't have a trace of humanity or believability. 1984 is a distopia-type novel without even a hint of truth in it. That makes it completely unbelievable and un-haunting.I would have given this five stars when I first read it in high school around 1966, but it is ridiculous now."

"375",374,"Daphne","Terrible book. I have no idea why it's so popular."
"376",375,"Andrew Hershauer","I personally really didn't like this book all that much. ""1984"" did a grand job of portraying life under a utopian/dystopian society, but I didn't enjoy reading it. This story started off good, with the basis for the society, how people lived, how the world was run and how Winston felt about it. The middle was where the book lost my interest. Orwell focused a lot of time and effort on Winston and Julia's relationship, but their relationship wasn't at all interesting. It definitely looked like he tried, but they came out as cardboard and lifeless as relationships can get. Towards the end, I started skipping pages, it just got watt too confusing and boring. The book followed the life of a regular person in a Utopian society, so I expected it to end badly... but it really just ended up hurting my head."
"378",377,"Azeila Rose","I completely despise this book. Horribly written, horrible characters, horrible story telling. I do not see how people like this book. I won't lie. The idea for this book was promising. But from the first few pages I found myself hating the main character. And I can't stand a story if it's told through a character I hate. Winston had little redeeming qualities, which was odd since he is supposed to be the ""hero"" of this novel. Instead we get monologues about how he wants to rape women, how frail he is, how much he hates his life, whine whine whine. Ugh. Human life is also regarded with little to no value in this book. Winston is very selfish, as is Julia. All anyone in this novel cares about is their own skin. Don't get me wrong, I think it's good to have ""flawed"" characters. But when all of the characters are so desensitized to anyone's needs but themselves, it gets to the point of me not caring about them at all! It's okay to have selfish, even sociopaths in a story, but it was over done here and not realistic. One of my least favorite books of all time!"

"388",387,"Sunny Lu","actually i feel like this book is so boring...when i read it,i really don't understand. I knew in 1984, government use instrument named ”telescreens” to keep watch on people. Using telescreens, you can always know everything in the country, there is no secret no matter where you are or who you are, even what you do. Nowadays, Internet seems like telescreens and the government probably can take advantages of this kind of technology to know anything they want to know. Every filed of social life was strict controlled by the nation. Love and marriage was forbidden, arranged by the state; propaganda ""Ministry of truth"" rewrites history at anytime in order to meet the needs of the policy. The story of 1984 is thought provoking, Privacy is very important to us. All of us dreams of living in a free and safe country, where we can feel happy and satisfy. But there are always so many problems to disappoint us. Recently, people’ private information and individual life to be protected by regulations and law. Nation also need to respect her people’s privacy. Not only Internet, drug testing but also everything in our life. "
"390",389,"Theresa","This book was not what I thought it would be. I was really looking forward to reading it because so many have said how great it is. And there are so many cultural references that I wanted to get a handle on and understand. I hate to say it, but I found it to be quite boring and unsatisfactory in so many ways. Dark, dull and depressing is the best way for me to describe it. Most of it was utter nonsense to me. I just could not be drawn into the world the author had created. The descriptions of the political system and way of life were long, drawn out and completely uninteresting. I found myself skipping page after page because it just droned on and on endlessly. Ugh! Maybe this genre is just not my thing. I was curious; I wanted to like it, but I did not."

I couldn't find a reason why I should read a detailed description and a critique of a fictional totalitarian society that does not exist, and it is unlikely to exist in the future (although you may never know). I have better ways to waste my free time. This book might have been useful, even brilliant, in 1949 when it was first published, but it's obsolete now.To make it even worse, there is also a very unconvincing love story between two unlikeable characters.Of course this novel is a valuable warning against being brainwashed by propaganda, or about the importance of preserving history, or the dangers of being watched by our government, blah blah blah...; but still, there is nothing here I haven't heard before."

I love dystopian novels so I was expecting to love this, and was really surprised and disappointed by it. Orwell seemed to wallow in his own writing, asking us to take extreme interest in characters with no soul or empathy, and a dystopian world that tries so hard to be intellectually frightening it ends up seeming contrived. Orwell liked to sum up his world as:WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.I have to add,THIS BOOK GOES NO PLACETHE CHARACTERS ARE FLAT AND UNINTERESTINGI WAS BORN IN 1984 AND YOU COULD HAVE PAID MY BIRTH YEAR A BETTER TRIBUTE, MAN."

But judging this book solely on the story that it shared, it was terrible. I seriously would read 4 or 5 pages and promptly fall sleep. It was boring and tedious with the rants and explanations of the system of government. The characters (with the exception of the main character, Winston) were underdeveloped and for the most part uninteresting. There were moments here and there that the story began to get interesting, but then it really didn't go anywhere or the situation was resolved quickly. I really wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. If you go to Wikipedia and read their summary, it will give you the whole book in a nutshell and save you lots of time. "

The good qualities of the book surpass any bad qualities, but that in mind, it's a dystopia, so how can one like it? To like it would hint at some realization of this world, and then again to dislike it would somehow align oneself with the hateful, fearful motifs serving as the backbone of the novel.

"457",456,"Marcus Lira","The book is so shallow as to become disturbingly naïve at times. It felt as though I was listening to the ravings of a freshmen that just read a book on Marx and suddenly felt he'd grasped how dictatorships work. Newspeak is painfully crude if you know the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, and how its strong variants have been systematically debunked. The rest of his ideas didn't fair any better.Looking on the bright side, I now know what the book is all about, though I hate to say I'm not the least impressed."
"458",457,"Imaani","I'm sorry, but this was one of the least enjoyable books I have ever read. Some people might find it interesting, especially the whole ""Big Brother is Watching You"" thing, but I really didn't like it."
"459",458,"Karyn Buibish","1984 was not one of my favorite books to read in school. We read this my sophomore year of high school, and I found myself very confused half of the time. Someone's view of a book depends on their interests and qualities they look for in a ""good"" book. Basically, everyone has their own definition of a good book. For me, books that are solemn and don't really bring out any positive emotions in a reader can be depressing. Now, for 1984, I understand there were a lot of underlying assumptions within the text. For example, Big Brother was a symbol for the government. Big Brother is portrayed as a controlling, manipulative, and somewhat terrible ""thing."" It's more of an idea than an actual person or people. Basically, the citizens of Airstrip One all did what they were supposed to and obeyed this higher power. Although I didn't seem to really enjoy it while in high school, it is a little bit interesting when you think of this time period with English socialism. When you try to imagine yourself inside the book and as Winston Smith, the protagonist, it becomes a little more fascinating. Also, learning that George Orwell wrote it in 1948 and it was his take on the future makes you dig even deeper while reading. Now that I have furthered my education and have a better understanding of symbolism and vocabulary, I might consider taking another stab at reading 1984."

Update, as the first worst book I have read has been given one star, I shall give this one as well.This was my second attempt at reading it, and I only finished out sheer stubbornness, because the first time I gave up after 20 pages, and nearly quit twice this time round. I disliked Winston as a character, hated Big Brother and The party. If I had lived in the 50's and read this book I still don't believe that I would have found it disturbing or thought provoking, simply because I believe that humans will always have compassion towards one another, even if there is war happening in many places around the world. When it came to the parts with Winston reading 'the book', I had to skip those pages as what I did read was a repeat of what had already been written in the novel 1984, and I had had enough of the repetitive descriptions and dialogue. My first real joy came when Winston was locked in the Ministry of Love(what fucked up kind of name is that for a prison, seriously Orwell this is what you came up with?), and he was thinking of the bullet entering his brain through the back of his skull. I was hoping in the next chapter that it would happen and I would not need to read anymore, but no alas he survives and miraculously loves Big Brother. Perhaps in many years time I will re-read it, but for now it will stay hidden on the bookshelf as I don't want to see its title."

I could see myself reading this for school, but it's not something I can read for leisure and for fun. May have to give it another shot in the future, because it was interesting for the most part, but overwhelming by the end.

I feel like he gets way way too dramatic at every point for me to really get invested in anything. When the great reveal happened, I didn't even flinch. The climactic scene is particularly lackluster. I also resent this book for replacing books with literary merit in high school curricula. This book is for social studies class, not english."
"525",524,"LARRY","As posted in [http://www.amazon.com]:Others may have loved and raved this book but for me, I just could not wait to finish it. I am surprised I even finished it because some books I'll just stop reading it and move on to another book. I don't see how this book became a classic because it was redundant in style.*1984* is futuristic in nature. Winston Smith is one of many who works for the Ministry of Truth and is constantly watched by the televised omnipotent Big Brother. Winston's job is to distort or doctor the truths and facts that may contradict the Party.Discontent with his monitored life, he begins to secretly write in a journal which encourages him to think with critical analyses that would be viewed heretical by the Party. In addition, he meets Julia which they initiate sexual escapades, also in secret.Predictably, Winston and Julia are captured by the Party. Winston goes through torture to which the Party oversees in order to condition him back to Party's mission and beliefs. The plot is fairly simplistic but with redundant lines. ""Oceania has always been war with Eastasia."" ""Freedom is slavery."" ""Big Brother is watching you."" In other words, it was nothing but a lot of nonsensical fillers.Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone. "

"529",528,"Hali","Not the book I was expecting it to be. I mean after all the hype of how everyone has read this book and it's so fascinating, I was kind of disappointed.

The beginning was very intriguing, and I really liked reading it, and it reminded me of Fahrenheit 451 in the sense of destroying the books (or independent thoughts in 1984) the government is able to control society. As the book progressed however, I became bored until Winston and Julia got caught by the thought police. This turn in events helped regain my attention, but not enough for me to continue reading with full conviction to the book. I became leery and overall was quite bewildered at the bizarreness of the tail end of the novel. "

Maybe it's because of the following things:1. It's EXTREMELY long. There are paragraphs that last for almost two pages, which really bores me because there's nothing much going on but description after description after description. Oh, I know. Imagery. While I don't mind imagery, 1984 was simply too much for me to handle.2. Awkwardness.

I rate it alongside all Ayn Rand books- in the exact same vein it goes on and on preaching against this imaginary political- economic system- some sort of communism + plus ultra security. The meandering of the theology goes on for so long, you cannot get attached to the characters at all- even lesser than you would in Fountainhead. But honestly, I cannot stand these books with all those philosophizing about freedom and government repression where authors take some sort of moral highground of Western philosophy and write as if they have discovered the secret to an ideal society and ideal government system. Perhaps adding to this, is also the fact that I read this book in 2015 and not earlier. By now we have been so inundated in the media about the evils of both communism and heightened surveillance you cannot help but be bored by this same repetition. More to the point- living in the real world we are exposed daily to some of the real horrors being committed by governments of all kinds- China, US, Afghanistan and the Middle East that you cannot help but feel this is some feeble horror of a worst case scenario. Certainly- after the mess of the Middle East you feel like neither does the Western World who created this mess have any right to any moral high ground and writing these preachy books about the real nature of freedom, nor indeed the East with the horrors committed against people and especially women everyday. Much better to read the newspaper and think for ourselves about the questions raised than read this book. "

"588",587,"Tom Michalak","I first read this book in 10th grade and at the time I thought it to be a mind-blowing novel, so much so that for a long period afterwards it was one of the best books I had ever read. However, when you take into account the context in which this book was written, the political implications that come along with it, and when the character of Orwell himself are taken into consideration, the book's counter-revolutionary nature is revealed. Written by George Orwell, a man who at the height of the Nazi onslaught that resulted in the death of 28 million of the Soviet people, he declared that “willingness to criticize Russia and Stalin is the test of intellectual honesty. It is the only thing that from a literary intellectual’s point of view is really dangerous”, wrote 1984 above all as a political statement. The book has been a sharp weapon against socialism since being written and has been peddled by the ruling class ever since, and from their point of view, for good reason. "
"589",588,"Emeline","Bloody hell, this was a shite book. Utterly, misogynistic shite. This reads to me like a crash course in how NOT to write a dystopia. I regret every hour I lost in reading this, truly. The world made NO sense, contradictions abound and every other detail just had me thinking, ""really?! Big Brother let that slip, that's going to bite them in the ass one day and they don't even realize!"" That's just unbelievable, that such a supposedly all-powerful totalitarian state could make such simple mistakes, that weren't even acknowledged as mistakes in the narrative. It says miles about how lazy Orwell was about the finer details of his worldbuilding.The romance was bland as fuck and disturbing to boot. Over and over again I wanted to strangle Winston, and the only reason Julia is at all suited to him is because they're both terrible people. Utterly terrible. The amount of classism in this book made me feel ill, frankly, and I can't understand why anyone would want to write such a dreary, hopeless book. The only characters I actually liked were killed off.I just cannot comprehend how this book became so big. I can't. It's terrible. That's all I can say."

Yes. Could we get to the point where things are as bad as they were portrayed in this book? Again yes. In the end however this doesn't portray evil as evil and good as good.

The person who wrote the introduction in my edition mentioned that the narrative lacks development, the dialogue is sometimes weak, and most of the people are two-dimensional, existing only to explain a political point. Funny, because those things explain why I didn't like it as much as I would've wanted. Interesting and groundbreaking ideas don't yet make a good novel.

George Orwell wrote this novel as a warning to the people that the government might one day strip them of their rights. I didn't like this novel because the ending was freaky and a tad anticlimactic. The rats were a weird touch. It was way over done and over the top during the bulk of the novel and jam packed but the ending was awful. It was revolutionary for the time however. The main character did a complete 180 with his personality and made it difficult to render him dynamic or static. The woman in the novel named Julia was shallow and I didn't like her. Her note to him essentially asking for sex seemed fine but afterwards through her manners and such she showed herself as a poor representation for women. This novel was meant as a warning but it was more of a badly written complaint."

"646",645,"Steven Hummer","You could title this book 2009 this book is a clear representation of the current day and administration.Not a very exciting book the first half of the book consists of Winston and his girlfriend having sex,sex and more sex. Only when you get to part 3 and see what horror is in store for those who enter room 101 does the book's plot start to pick up the pace, but then all of the sudden the book became a snoozer and to cap it all off the good guy losses that wasn't right the bad guys always get theirs in movies, TV and books the good guys are always supposed to win that was the most disappointing thing about 1984. Despite my feelings of frustration with this book the narrator for the audio book did a very good job. I think you can never go wrong when you have a British narrator,but it wasn't just his cool accent that made the book great many narrators have that but a great narrator can put the emotion of the moment into his words. When the book is at a scary part the narrator's tone lets you knnow that and when Winston was in pain and crying the narrator put that sense of pain and crying into his voice that really brought the book to life. "
"647",646,"Shiloah","I seriously disliked this book. I think what I dislike the most is that it is on reading lists for teens and it will filled with sex scenes and sexual innuendos. In my readings, I've come across far more appropriately written books without all the immorality and promiscuity that is NOT needed to share. Some immediate recommendations coming to my mind are: Living with Agenda 21, the Mysterious Benedict Society, The Bridge at Andau. And honestly, just listening to what's going on in our world now is helpful. Podcasts such as Nothing But Truth. Or the movie Agenda. "

It was horrific, unbearable. Just reading about this stinking dystopian society was a horror, imagine living there. Waste of time to be honest. "
"659",658,"Debbie","I read through about half this book until it got too dirty for me to continue. I really liked the plot and the world that the author created, so it was especially sad when I had to stop. It is too bad that authors feel like they have to put so much junk in a book. He could have made his point with a lot less. I guess since I read mostly Young Adult Fiction I am more sensitive than usual when vulgar stuff is put in.This is the second ""classic"" book that I have read this year that has been disappointing. I think I am going to take a break from reading the ""classics"" for a while. "

It at least probably makes me a Communist. I think Mr Orwell should have just written an essay. How can anyone say this is a love story? The characters are superflous. I did't care about them in the least. I honestly was hoping they would kill Winston off as soon as they caught him. If you want to read a good book in the same genre that is WORLDS better then read Farenheit 451 or Brave New World. Both are leaps and bounds better than this drivel. "

"698",697,"Michael Connery","Depressing overall. It probably suffers from popularity because I couldn't help feeling the first part was very derivative when in fact it is the source of most of the derivation I'm thinking of. The second part I liked most because it at least had a modicum of hope, despite the narration focusing more on the characters weaknesses than their strengths. The third part was just difficult to get through. I don't like unhappy endings."
"699",698,"Daron","I finally read the book 1984 by Orwell. My opinion: Borderline genius descriptions of war, tyranny, surveillance, propaganda...But... the book still sucked. Why? Winston was a weak-minded pansy. And because of that, the ending was an awful, depressing, Satan-inspired call to simply give up and give into his system.Sorry folks, but I'm thinking 1984 is doublethink. Pure progressive propaganda, written by a communism-hating socialist. From wikipedia: ""Orwell stated: ""a real Socialist is one who wishes – not merely conceives it as desirable, but actively wishes – to see tyranny overthrown.""""Too bad he didn't realize that socialism and communism are two faces on the same satanic coin.May be a classic. Wasn't for me."
"701",700,"Tamara","I know this is a great book, but the rating system asks if you like it or not. I don't like the protagonist to fail utterly- it makes me not want to be human."
"703",702,"Kieran Lyne","Hugely disappointing. I never engaged with the characters; and a section around halfway through reads more like an instructional manual and lasts far too long. I only kept going because it’s such a small book and I lost interest by the end. The only good thing for me to come out of 1984 was David Bowie's Diamond Dogs.Instead of 1984 I would highly recommend We by Yevgeny Zamyatin: it’s the book which inspired Orwell and the similarities are shocking. Orwell has taken the plot, characters and conclusions, but turned them into something far less interesting. We is fantastic and is better in just about every single way."

I didn't find it prophetic—the future (which is now the present) isn't like that. It wasn't very horrific—if it was, i wouldn't have read it, I was never scared, and what happened wasn't ever scary. And scifi? What was scientific? The screens watching and listening? Manipulating the past? I didn't think so. "

"729",728,"Pearl","I did not enjoy this novel; it truly belonged in the horror genre. At times, real life events do have a resemblance to fiction.Our leading character, Winston works for a department of the Ministry of Truth. Proles are the working class people that Winston thinks and/or voices his opinion about. He spoke out loud his thoughts in a room he assumed was safe. He stated that “these people will become a race of conscious beings”. This was considered a thoughtcrime which causes him and his lover, Julia, to be hauled away to the Ministry of Love and endured tortured for their correction and/or conversion process. This place is a windowless building in which there is no darkness because the lights are always on and never turned off. Charrington, a Thought Police Enforcer and O’Brian are both higher up in the “The Party” regime and controls all records and human memory. They take great pleasure in the torture of others to keep them in line and to “correct” their thinking.While held captive at the Ministry of Love, Winston finds that Parsons, a neighbor is also there because he was denounced by his young daughter for a thoughtcrime; she heard him said that he hated “ Big Brother” in his sleep one night so she reported him to the authorities. In this world, it is believed that reality “exists” only in the “Party” and not in the individual human mind. Only the “Party” holds the truth. Winston is reminded that he is not here to be punished, but to be “cured” and converted. This correction went on for weeks. O’Brian ordered that Winston be taken to Room 101 for the ultimate correction. Finally, at his wits end, Winston is forced to abandon his beloved Julia; turning against her to save himself. The ending was predictable and sad."
"732",731,"Carly Feltham-palmer","The big brother side of the story I actually really enjoyed, and scarily enough I could see something like this happening in the future. However, I feel I lost 6 hours of my life reading this book. My mum has raved about this book for years having initially read it in High School, so I had really high expectations. Sorely disappointed. Sorry to the fans..."
"734",733,"Daniel Gomez"," Brilliant books require plenty of insight and creative thought to spark the readers inquisitive nature. George Orwell's 1984 clearly lacked a lot of this. His depiction of a militant society that exploits terrorism and has plunged into regressions was a product of absolute folly. Furthermore, his diction and attempt to keep a common thread of logic flowing through his characters failed to express itself legitimately and resulted in an obtuse depiction. His creation of a hierarchy society that is constantly monitored and treated poorly by the state was a failure to pass the precinct that typical authors stay within. The senseless drama and needless exertion of Orwell's theme of mass surveillance proved to be excessive and a dull read.  The main characters in the story, Winston, O'Brian, and Julia, all share the desire to escape their governments grasp. In particular, Winston is the protagonist against the malign nature of The Party. That being the government, which attempts to control every aspect of human life through manipulation of the press, in citizens speech, and in new technological advances. It is this aspect of having a totalitarian government dictating over human life that rankles me. Orwell's word choice made the reading too extreme and rid itself of the reason that creates sound books.  This absence was accompanied by a simpleminded girl, Julia, who came into contact with Winston and fell in love with him. Their love affair in the massive surveillance society faced a multitude of obstacles and plenty of close calls with the government, but Found a way to manage besides coming into close contact with The Party. Again, on topic of love , Orwell fails to utilize the profundity behind this awesome abstraction. In particular, the highs and lows of their relationship created droll paroxysms that left the reader discombobulated at the abrupt scenes. These abnormalities in the structure of Orwell's writing lacked a tenacious quality and failed to hold the book together. This deficit was neither noticed or atoned for by Orwell's meaning in the obscurity between the lines within the pages of his book.  Next, Orwell's attempt to manifest the liberation of the individual was nebulous and difficult to notice within the black and white comprised in his writing style. Winston being the individual, an alleged intellectual who is exhibiting the erratic qualities which his socialistic society is against. His contempt and aloofness towards Big Brother, the head of The Party, is ridiculed by most of the citizens and disregarded by The Party. It is Winston's strive that is revered to by the book and treated as the sign of a desire to keep the ego. Here, Orwell established another primary theme, but didn't format the notion in an order that flows. Such an action took away important aspects of the books theme and and sullied an opportunity to explain a valuable aspect of modern day ideology. Overall, Orwell selected a profound theme with various ramifications, but failed to explain his perspective due to vapid diction and a dull writing style which reached to entirely predictable scenes. Though I would recommend looking into the theme of mass surveillance society, I wouldn't search for it in the horrendous style that comprised Orwell's writing."

In the book, I think ""Goldstein"" has the views of the author. I do not like how when reading this book the author just has to confuse us more with putting another book into it! Julia and Winston's ""love life"" is fake and extremely uninteresting. Who loves someone before they met them? No one! And I think it is EXTREMELY not good that O'Brien is a traitor! I wish someone actually went against the party as well. I would not reccomend this book to anyone, not even someone I don't even like! When I was told what this book was about I was actually excited, maybe a school book could actually be good! But then I realized it isn't like bombs and stuff bringing the world to an end, it is power, people and ways of life. I also don't like how the book thinks you actually know about their new languages, boundary lines and everything else they changed. I think the author should have just told you. "

I recommend it to everyone who liked 1984 Zamyatin E.МыFirstly, language and other stylistic and symbolic aspects are much better: We contains religious implications (references to the Bible) which 1984 is lacking. Commonly, countries with totalitarian regime forbid people to have any religious views.Secondly, We is a story written by the real witness of creating of totalitarian regime (Bolshevism-Leninism-Stalinism) and personality cult (subsequently depersonalized and called Big Brother) or by allegedly a main character (as you wish).Thirdy, it is a fact that Orwell has read We before writing 1984. And lets be frank Orwell has completely swiped the plot of the story with its major details.Eventually,that is why it is easy to notice that We more truly depicts people`s life though it is anti-utopia."

Disappointing, though at the same time, very deep, intellectal and even a bit ""prophetic"" if you want to word it that way."
"809",808,"Torasalem","This book was hard to read. I was really excited by the premise of the book. I just had such a hard time staying interested and finishing the book certainly became more of a chore. I especially had a hard time reading about New Speak and how that came about as well as understanding the Thought Police. The whole end of the story confused me.This was just not one of my favorites."

"815",814,"Isabela Rovira","1984 is the classic dystopian novel. It tells the story of Winston and his life in the authoritarian regime of Oceania. All activity is monitored and the story revolves around Winston’s rebellion. The novel is packed with symbolism and metaphors. If you into stories with deep meaning, then this is really the book for you. Otherwise, you will get tired of the political manifesto that plagues this novel. Many of the novel’s theme involve personal liberties and freedoms. Although Orwell tries to be meaningful, the story and the characters are not charming or personable at all. Indeed, the creepiest part of the novel was Winston’s fascination with a younger woman. I was not a fan. This was a very controversial book at the time it was written and has since been referenced in a lot of media arguments against government surveillance. "

"820",819,"Kat Garino","This is one of the strangest books that I have ever read. I went into this novel expecting the great dystopia story like I heard it was about. But I was disappointed to find out that this book is really just a political philosophy book on the state of human nature. The story line itself is quite thin, and over half of the book is chapter after chapter of philosophical wondering. Although the book is not necessarily bad, it is not something I enjoyed reading. The ideas were disturbing, as they were meant to be, and didn't provide any means of reconciliation within the story. Fans will obviously argue that this was the whole point of the novel,"
"821",820,"Phillip","I know I'm in the minority with this but I REALLY didn't like the book at all. I gave up at page 248, or 284. It just felt like one big long, boring description with tiny bits of a story here and there."

Big Brother, the fake wars, 2+2=5, telescrenes - ugh to all of it. You may be wondering why I finished the book. Aside from my OCD-like need to leave no page unturned, I was hoping that in the end Winston might defy Big Brother. He knew his simple math, and the creepiness of changing the past. I was looking for redemption. Alas, it never came...it NEVER came!"

I can understand the paranoia, but seriously this was just boring to the end. Even the torture scenes where kind of *yawn*. I can't say my life has improved from reading this, but it was a required read and I read it. I would not recommend it to anyone else though. Unless you seriously like drawn out dystopian novels. I was just a little disappointed by Orwell."
"850",849,"Wesley Hanson","Not recommended, was confusing."
"851",850,"JackieB","I thought this was rubbish. The characters were one dimensional (at best) and I wasn't interested in what happened to them. I thought the setting was totally unconvicing - a totalitarian state which re-wrote the past to suit its purposes. So old editions of newspapers, magazines, books - in fact any media which referred to the past was repeatedly edited to reflect the state's changing version of events. How would that work in reality? It would be impossible to cope with the admin. I know this is supposed to be a satire but even so I thought this was too ridiculous to stomach. Finally the plot was banal and moved at the spead of a glacier. But apart from the characters the setting and the plot it was great!"

I understand why this book is important, and I can appreciate the message. It's more timely now than ever. But this book depressed me. It was so disturbing, I was in a funk for two weeks. It still makes me nauseous just to think about it. It was a real page turner and the writing was good. On that alone I'd probably give it 4 or 5 stars. But on the negative emotional impact it had on me, as a reader, I can only give it one star. I hated it. Loathed it!"

"881",880,"Dominic","In this book, all our morals were flipped around. Its about the Soviet Union and and they had this leader figure they called ""BROTHER"", and they would watch everyone through something they called a telescreen , which was a TV. They also had the thought police, they would arrest anyone who disagreed with ""BROTHER"". The main character, and eventually a women he met were both trying to put the truth in the open. In the end, when they were both captured, they both betrayed each other. I do not like this book because to me, it is boring. I really do not like how the way it ends because they really did not achieve anything."

"903",902,"Michael Lloyd-Billington","This is another classic the reading of which I kept deferring because what I knew of both the topic & Orwell's philosophy lead me to suspect it would not be my cup of tea. Alas, I was all-too-right :) In my opinion, this is one of the more profoundly over-rated ""classics"" out there -- other than the introduction of the highly-debatable premise of societal control through linguistic restriction, this book has absolutely nothing, in my opinion, to offer the reader. The psychological portrayal is decent, but the dystopian vision is one-dimensional & the evolution, particularly the last few chapters, was for me farcical & utterly unbelievable, as well as completely non-instructive/constructive. I've read worse, of course, but not very many where the distance between reputation & content is, in my opinion, this vast...."
"904",903,"Summer","It was okay"
"906",905,"Bette","I re-read this book because my 8th grade daughters were offered the opportunity to read it for their English class. I didn't recall it too well since I'd read it in high school (a loooong time ago). For the first 3/4 of the book, I was interested. It's a grim, grim tale, but it's a powerful one, written soon after WWII. I was very surprised at how much sex there was in it; I didn't remember that at all. I also was reading it this time always conscious of how a 13-year-old might react to it. I can't see how kids that age would get through the book. It seems to me that it would bore them enormously. Moreover, I think the sex, while it might at first titillate, would be disturbing since it is grim and unpleasant: sex is seen as an act of revolt against the Party rather than as an act of love. In fact, there is little joy in the first 3/4 of the book. However, the last quarter was unreadable for me. The violence, humiliation, and terror that Winston & the other prisoners are put through were unbearable. I skimmed that last part of the book, paying attention mainly to the parts I'd underlined so many years ago.I am not denying that 1984 is a masterpiece. But I simply do not have the stomach for it anymore. "
"907",906,"Hashim Alsughayer","A perfect essay, but a boring flat novel!"
"908",907,"Russell Hayes","I could not finish it. For a far more realistic interpretation of the future/present, see brave new world. "
"909",908,"Alice","It is apparent by this book that George Orwell is highly intelligent. The society spoken of in this book must have taken a lot of figuring out, looking at every angle with which one might be able to dispute the likelihood that a society as Oceania could evolve and come up with a reasonable argument to support his idea. He did very good at that.However, I couldn't stand this book. It was depressing throughout. I kept hoping for something uplifting, and never found it. I thought the end might turn around into something that showed Man's spirit triumphs, but it did not. I was terribly disappointed.This is not to say that others would not like the book. It is very well-written and did keep my interest, and some might like the deep thinking that it induces. I did not. Call me a shallow thinker. ;)Several times the book brings out the fact that there were no laws; but contradicted it by having consequences to actions, words, thoughts, and feelings that were not allowed. Are those not laws? They didn't call it punishments, but re-training. I didn't buy that.Big Brother was supposed to be watching your every move, listening to your every word, even being able to know what you're thinking by the smallest twitch in your expression. Poppycock! I just don't see how it would be humanly possible to have a person behind every person's telescreen. And then you would have to have a person watching every person who is watching a person, and so forth. Yes, we could argue about that from this story's point of view, but it really isn't logical in the real world we live in.I also didn't understand not being allowed to write. There were exceptions, but I still wonder if children were taught to write in school or not. This seemed contradictory.I also thought his betrayal of Julia was weak. That part of the story just didn't jive with me.I find it very unbelievable, too, to think that a society could reduce their language's vocabulary to such a narrow range as suggested in this story. Even if they succeeded, it would begin to grow again, because people make new words to describe thoughts and feelings not found in other words. Sure, if everyone was truly brainwashed into only using those words, it might be possible; but then, that is another thing I disagree with - not every human being can be brainwashed into the model this story suggests; there would always be those where logic would rule. And let's not even talk about the Light of Christ.These are just some of the things I found not plausible. I feel Orwell cheated, too, when he was able to explain his theory by introducing ""The Book"" and then having Winston read from it. While it gave a quick understanding to the audience as to Orwell's theory of this Big Brother society, in my judgment it was cheap, not to mention dry and boring.It is inconceivable to think that man can be reduced to a purely mechanical mentality. Orwell takes the spirit out of man, takes his agency or freedom to choose away, and takes emotion and all that makes man a man, and turns them into biological robots. If that were the case, man could not survive. I wish I had the vocabulary to use words that could really describe how I feel about this book. Even though I use Oldspeak, I still don't have the ability to put my feelings into words. How ironic!"
"911",910,"Mana","It is hard to really like 1984 after reading Мы (We), the Russian classic dystopian science fiction written by Zamyatin E. in the 1920s. 1984's plot is almost completely copied from We (Orwell admits he was ""inspired,"" though frankly, he might as well have said it was copied scene by scene, character by character, for 3/4 of the book), but what made We compelling were lost. The fluid narrative with its absurdly mathematical references were watered down, taking away from the intensity of the change for the protagonist when he falls in love. In Orwell's defense, 1984's more ordinary narrative is more relateable, and the anguish and physical discomfort experienced by the main character **spoiler alert** during the torture scene later in the novel **spoiler end** comes through in a way We isn't able to convey as vividly. Like good foreign films remade for Hollywood, 1984 is only shocking for those who haven't read the original that inspired the cheap American version."
"913",912,"Eddy Allen","The author of this book obviously didn't do his research.The title of the book is ""1984,"" but it might as well take place a few billion years after. The year 1984 actually was rife with punks sporting mullets and leather jackets, electronic-influenced music and terribly produced science-fiction movies. By no account was there a futuristic society involving some omniscient leader named ""Big Brother."" If this is a stab at Ronald Reagan then as a devoted American citizen, I am highly insulted. And it obviously takes place in the US (they all speak American English), so don't attempt to contradict me by saying it could be Communist Russia or the People's Republic of China. I wasn't in the least ""challenged"" by the book as all my colleagues predicted I would be; in fact my intellect was insulted by the lack of research put into this novel. Obviously this George Orwell is some punk kid out of college who wasn't even alive in the 80s and is preaching about something he did not even experience. Obviously this Orwell spent his high school years playing hooky and smoking the reefer instead of attending his History class, a utility that would have greatly benefited the writing of this novel."

"919",918,"Kirsty Noah-whitlock","Firstly, apologies to anyone who enjoyed this book for this brutal review! To be fair I was going to give it a 2 star, one for me opening and one for me finishing the book.. however it really lost that second star when I started reading the appendix and actually felt suicidal it was that boring and depressing!! Reviewing the book itself.... what a drag! The only time it got interesting was towards the end. I won't say why for those poor people who will read this it's the only decent bit and I don't want to spoil it! I know I'm being harsh but to be honest it's only got the one star as I made myself suffer to the end in the small hope it would get better!! This book is slow and boring for me, some OK concepts but that's pushing it. Couldn't wait to finish so I could read something better like the back of a bleach bottle. Sorry Orwell but if I run out of loo roll I wouldn't think twice and I scream at people for bending pages so I think this sums up my thoughts xx"
"920",919,"Mallory","For being the book that so many are compared to, I didn't think it was all that clever. It was often boring or just completely unbelievable. I get that the 1984 world is supposed to be extreme and outrageous, but there was never a satisfactory explanation of how it came to be that way."
"922",921,"Carrie","I love that I'm old enough to not finish a book if I don't like it. No teacher requiring me to finish it for a grade. I was struggling through the beginning of this book when I mentioned it to my book club. Their comments were all similar: It is a dark book. I continued reading it anyway, thinking there must be something interesting about it. I came to a part I was uncomfortable reading, but pushed onward with the idea that I will stop reading it if there is another uncomfortable part. Then I thought, Why? I don't have to. I skipped to the last page and it was just as depressing as the beginning so I stopped. The problem with this book is that there is no light in it. Now I understand what my book club friends meant. There are better things to do with my time than read such a book."
"926",925,"J. Morgan","I tried. I really tried to like this book. Yeah, I know--it's a ""classic"". Still, I didn't like it. Had it not had such a buzz, I wouldn't have finished it. I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't."

"940",939,"Johnny Leal","You know those 'block text' emails you get from your ant Rita that just go on and on about how uncle Herbert bruised his gums eating that key lime pie last winter? That's what this book felt like. I *hate* Orwell with a passion. Animal Farm was horrible, and so is this book. Its just one big block of text and it just gets more and more boring as each page gets turned."

"942",941,"Jeffrey Milloy","this was the worst 50 pages i've read in a long long time. or at least over-hyped."
"943",942,"Tome Reader","DNF boring. Telling, telling, telling. Info dumping. It was an interesting bleak world Orwell built. I enjoyed it up until the chapters of the secret book. And that was interesting for a couple of pages but then went on and on and on and was rather redundant. So I just skipped reading Goldstein's book and got back to Winston and Julia. Then came the climatic part and that was interesting for a while but I was just done with this book and so I skipped to the end and I am glad I didn't invest any more time with it. Really dumb ending. I'd be the prole singing that dumb song while hanging up the laundry. "
"946",945,"Rich Thornton","Contains Spoilers!I'm not very political, so I choose not to review this book on those grounds. People will argue that that's the whole point of the book. If that's what you care about, then read another review. My objective is to review it on the basis of books in general: was it worth reading? My answer to that is no. It starts off well enough, focusing on Winston, the world around him, and his interactions with and within it. It actually develops well enough that I became excited to find out what happens to Winston and Julie and become emotionally attached to their situation. Then when I expect the next logical progression of the plot, they meet O'Brien, and they get the book. This is where the book goes totally off the rails and turns into (in my opinion) a piece of shit. Winston reads from the book. And at that point I begin to realize I'm reading about a character reading about a subject that 1) I don't care about 2) Is presented like a dissertation to be presented for scholarly review and 3) Totally cuts through the story Orwell was weaving and ruins any momentum he had generated to that point. And the worst part about it is, after throwing up his political perspectives in my face, he has his character directly acknowledge that the book ""had not told him anything that he did not know, it had merely systematized the knowledge that he possessed already."" One could argue that we the reader already had a decent idea of how Oceania worked before Orwell drove the story into the ditch, so why do it? The remainder of the book seemed more to me a walkthrough of how, through torture, you can utterly destroy the mind and spirit of another human being. I didn't particularly care for it. I had lost my connection to the story and this walkthrough wasn't enough to get me to re-engage with it. I finished the book feeling angry and cheated of my time. If anyone would care to inform me of what it is I'm missing that makes this book so widely adored and required reading in many school systems, I'd greatly appreciate. As it stands, my suspicion is that most say they like it to feel superior, intelligent, and an accepted part of the majority. What a waste. "
"954",953,"Audrey Trotter","I have honestly tried to trudge my way through this book (yes, trudge) at least five times. Each time I get painstakingly bored about thirty pages into the book. Honestly, I do not usually have trouble with classics. I think I just cannot find my way through Orwell's writing. I do not mean that I do not understand it. The story is pretty straightforward. I just have not gotten motivated or interested enough to finish this book, which is very strange for me. Hopefully, I will eventually get through this book. "
"956",955,"Kylie","I had to read this for a government class in high school. The idea of the book sounds good, but the actual story is no bueno. It drags like crazy in the middle and has too much detail about... his... personal affairs... with Julia... and it cap it all off, it ends lamely, too!"
"958",957,"Shrikanya","I felt that the book was very depressing."
"960",959,"Stephanie Kabetzke","This book was recommended to me because I enjoyed The Hunger Games so much. I was excited to read it, until I tried to read it. I attempted to read the first chapter 3 times. The premise of the book seems beyond fascinating, however, the way it's written is sleep and headache inducing. I just couldn't do it. If you can read it, more power to you. "
"961",960,"Manca","I wanted to read this book for quite some time, just to see what all the fuss is about. I expected a lot from it since it's a ""must-read"", a classic and so many people's favorite book. Having now finally read it, I have to say I don't see what is so special about it. In my opinion, it's actually pretty bad as a whole. Contents: I was quite impressed at the beginning of the book, what with all the control over people and its similarity to today's surveillance issues (remember NSA?). But from that point on things just started to get silly and way too exaggerated. 1. Changing history. Yes, the history is usually written by winners, but is it not nearly as subjective as this book wants us to believe + how could everyone just forget something happened? Which leads to 2., brainwashing. Yes, it happens, but to this extent? I don't believe all the people can be brainwashed (although this is precisely what Orwell wants to show with Winston, that pitiful bastard). Then no genuine relationships between people; newspeak; thoughtcrimes... And the final disappointment: Winston converting. Despite all his previous scepticism, doubt and arguments he not only embraces Ingsoc regime, but actually starts to love Big Brother. Love, like he has never loved anyone before! This spineless creature makes me sick. So all in all, the contents did not convince me. Writing style: Oh, my god, where do I start. The first part of the book seemed to be 700 pages long. It just wouldn't end. When things started happening with Julia, I thought ""this is it"" but was only let down again by all the awkward scenes. If this isn't the clumsiest way to describe sex I don't know what is. The last part of the book was a total opposite to the first: it all happened so fast. Even the important scenes (like Winston's imprisonment) were so poorly described and all of a sudden it was five years later. Are you kidding me? Final verdict: This book is bad literature and there are many, many better books worth picking up. As to the (supposed) parallels between this book and today's reality: despite all the conspiracy theories etc. I refuse to draw them. I refuse to believe the world can be so corrupt and humanity so weakly. The thought that whole populations could actually be reduced to this is frankly insulting. "
"962",961,"Mike","Why this book is a ""must read"" for young people is beyond me. The book is both crass and stupid. I got more from the Afterword by Erich Fromm than I did from the book itself.It has no more value than Fahrenheit 451."
"965",964,"Betsy","Depressing depressing depressing ..."
"967",966,"William Ellis","Winston is a middle aged man who lives in present day London. He is a regular member of society, meaning that there is nothing that really separates him from others. Winston currently lives under a totalitarian government, which rules by fear and harsh punishments. No one ever thinks about going against them, until one day Winston finds an old diary and decides to write his thoughts in it, which is a crime punishable by death. Throughout the book Winston is constantly trying to do anything and everything he can to go against the government, all without them finding out. I didn't like the book mainly because there wasn't very much speaking, the author just went into extreme detail about everything. My second reason is that there wasn't enough action for it to be enjoyable for me. "
"973",972,"Ravelle Pittman","It was one of the most depressing, disturbing books I had ever had the misfortune to open. If you hate naturalism in literature as much as I, don't read it unless it is a course requirement or you lose a bet."
"974",973,"Kaley Ridge","*somewhat biased review* I LOVE reading. I do not like being told what to read and how fast I have to read it. I had to read this book for school and I wasn't given the adequate amount of time to appreciate it fully. It was hard for me to read/get through and I did not finish it completely. I did not like it."
"976",975,"Laura Crosse","Hmm... Okay so I'm sure that many people have gone before me and wrote extremely intelligent reviews about how this book is so timeless and still relates to the present worlds politics and how it's so well written for it's time and basically just how wonderful it is but I'm not going to write a review like that. I was disappointed to be honest.I found the characters to be lacking any interesting personality traits. The whole concept of the world they were living in was confusing a lot of the time and I hated the ending. The ending usually makes or breaks a book for me. I personally like things to be tied up nice and neatly with all subplots and major plots alike come to complete close. Only if the book is one in a series do I tolerate anything else. So I did not enjoy the ending of this book.Of course there were good things about this book too, it wouldn't make it onto dozens of best books lists if there weren't some appealing things about it. I liked the fact that it was written in 1948 about the future, 1984 obviously, and how the author had come up with this possible world we could have all been living in. I'm not sure if you can call it a post-apocalyptic or dystopian future as there doesn't seem to have been any major disaster or pandemic but it is a completely different world all the same so it's defiinitely post-something. I don't know, I'm actually trying really hard to think of something else good to write about this novel but I'm failing miserably. I feel like because it's such a classic that I should like it but I apologise to any Orwell fans out there as this was a brutal disappointment in my eyes. There were too many confusing twists, the whole Party ideal was ridiculous and also extremely confusing at the best of times (don't get me started on DOUBLETHINK) and the characters lacked appeal."

"982",981,"Christen Mamenko","After thoroughly enjoying Animal Farm, I was surprised at how much I didn't like 1984. I did not the violence, its perversion, or psychological torture. I hovered between a 1- and 2-star rating, but the appendix at the end pushed it to 1. save time and watch Brazil, which I also disliked."
"983",982,"Ileen","Se dicessi che ho capito questo libro, esagererei; se dicessi che mi è piaciuto mentirei. Eppure qualche cosa, qualche piccolissima cosa, mi ha lasciato. Già solo le date di inizio e fine la dicono lunga sulla mia svogliatezza nel girare queste pagine, ma quando mi impongo di leggere un libro, normalmente, che mi piaccia o no, mi impongo anche di terminarlo. Stavolta è stata davvero dura ed a un certo punto ho detto “ok, ti lascio un po’ sul comodino”. Le ultime cento pagine le ho lette negli ultimi 4 giorni; a saperlo prima, finivo mesi fa. Di fatto c’è che mi ha annoiato e molto. Non ho mai amato Orwell come autore… ma per averne consapevolezza dovevo leggere qualcosa di suo, partendo dalla “Fattoria degli animali” ed arrivando al tanto conclamato 1984. Che noia! E che angoscia! So che un libro ha la metà del suo contenuto legato al contesto e sicuramente estrapolarlo non è mai una buona idea, però, sinceramente, è un libro di un sadico. Ne ho letti di libri di torture e massacri, di stragi e di terrorismo n’è colma l’Europa come l’America Latina, l’Africa come l’Asia. Ma c’è una grossa differenza tra queste storie vere e il libro di Orwell: il sadismo. Questo libro emana una cattiveria infinita e sembra quasi che l’idea che si trasmette sia quella di esaltare tutto questo, invece che deplorarlo. Non è per la fine, ci sta anche un po’ di realismo: quando mai vedete il bene trionfare sul male? Mai. Il realismo ci sta. Ma tutto questo sadismo meno. Le prime cento pagine sono state un’agonia, una lunghissima agonia girata intorno a Winston Smith, unico (o quasi) protagonista del libro, se escludiamo il Grande Fratello. Il mondo di Winston è un mondo diviso in tre parti, in guerra tra loro: Estasia Eurasia ed Oceania, patria di Smith. In Oceania esiste il Partito e l’occhio del Grande Fratello che guarda tutto e tutti sempre, 24h su 24. Guai a discostarsi da quello che secondo il partito è vero e giusto! La Psicopolizia (che ricorda molto le Squadre della Morte argentine) entra in azione. Ma come si fa a credere in qualcosa che ogni cinque minuti viene adattato e cambiato a seconda della esigenza? Nel mondo dell’Oceania non esiste il passato: questo infatti viene riscritto ogni giorno, è in continuo mutamento ed in continuo adattamento… ma sempre in linea con il partito. Il Partito è l’unica certezza. Nel mondo di Winston non c’è spazio per nulla, le giornate sono rigidamente scandite, ben regolamentate e regolate; con un occhio sempre puntato addosso non è facile scappare da questa regolarità che, se infranta, porta alla morte. O almeno per una parte della popolazione; per il 90% di essa, invece, la Psicopolizia non esiste nemmeno. Sono i prolet, il gradino più basso, l’incarnazione della degradazione e dell’ignoranza, personificazione dell’inutilità. Capisco il pessimismo di quegli anni, ma questo mondo, ribadisco, è proprio eccessivamente sadico. Senza contare che in tutto il libro i discorsi filosofeggianti di Orwell non fanno una piega, se si segue il suo filo, ma c’è una pecca: dov’è il bandolo della matassa? Dove è cominciato il filo logico? A metà del libro c’è una lunga lettura di Winston, il quale viene in possesso di un libro pericolosissimo, di quella che potremmo chiamare la resistenza, un libro nel quale si smaschera in Grande Fratello per quello che è; in questa parte l’autore regala perle di saggezza sull’evoluzione delle masse, sul progresso, sui cicli storici, arrivando poi a dimostrare come sia possibile che il regno della dittatura Oceanica non finisca mai… si ma senza contare quel gradino iniziale che spieghi come tutto quello che Winston vive sia stato realizzabile che è molto diverso dal dimostrare come in realtà possa sopravvivere a tutto. Non credo nell’assoluta imbecillità dell’intera umanità nello stesso momento; disgraziatamente al mondo esistono le dittature e grazie a Dio finiscono, che mietono un’infinità di vite e costano molti sacrifici che si ripercuotono sulle generazioni successive. La gente (tutta) però, ad un certo punto, desidera la pace talmente tanto che è in grado di ripristinarsela a forza. E la gente scontenta è sempre di più, rispetto a quella contenta. Variabile non indifferente.Senza questionare oltre sulle teorie di Orwell, vi dirò che a un certo punto Winston viene scoperto, viene accusato di essere contro al Partito e viene catturato. Essere catturati dalla Psicopolizia significa due cose: essere torturati e morire, perché il ribelle va prima distrutto, poi ricostruito ed infine eliminato. Questa sarà la sorte che attende il nostro protagonista, insieme al quale vivremo l’angoscia del torturato, la paura e la sofferenza, l’egoismo di chi per amore della propria vita è disposto a sacrificare il mondo intero. Mors tua vita mea. Indubbiamente c’è poco da giudicare in questo atteggiamento.Non è un libro che consiglierei, però forse leggendolo vi rimarrà qualcosa, qualcosa che non saprete cos’è né come chiamare ma pur sempre qualcosa. Alla fine l’importante, per un libro, è lasciare la traccia dentro di noi."
"984",983,"Alexandrea J. ","I started reading this because I really respect George Orwell and this book is a classic and so I thought, I need to get myself familiar with the books that are incredibly popular.I also thought since I am living in the very future that the man was talking about (well in the sense that it is past 1984), it would be a good idea to read.The book was hauntingly accurate but I had a really hard time getting through the really violent parts. I wasn't able to finish it BUT I do want to finish it in the future, I just wasn't ready for it. He's a great writer, so I'll definitely give it a try again one day. :)"

I know I should give more stars to this one because its importance of content but I mainly give stars based on the entertainment value of the book and this one is not entertaining in any way. I don't think I have ever read a gloomier book. Simply dreadful. "
"997",996,"Madison","Although the point of the book is magnificent, it is not a captivating book. "
"998",997,"Taylor","George Orwell, the bland taste this book gave me was a serious shock. I was expecting so much more. The concepts used are fantastic, but as a story, the characters lacked substance and I felt that Orwell used this book as a way of conveying his feelings about the socio-political issues. Which, would be fine, if it was a thesis. As a novel, I truly felt that the writing dragged, and Orwell could have made it poignant and hearfelt, but fell flat. This is quite an unpopular opinion, I'm sure. I was actually surprised at how much I ended up detesting this book."
"1000",999,"Aimee","Hated it. Can't really say much else."
"1001",1000,"Jewelz Jayo","This book was long, and confusing. It took me awhile to understand, and I still also am a little bit confused. Because I am still condfused, I dont know much about the book, other then it had something to do with a room numbered 101, and everyone was affraid of it. I'd recomend this book to anyone who can gather information easily, and also can get on track really fast. "
"1005",1004,"Maria Kaye","DNFA fact you should know about me is that I will never ever read classics UNLESS I'm somehow forced to. E.g for school-related stuff. But I thought I'd give this a go since some of my friends started a little hype amongst them. I didn't enjoy it. I think it was the writing style, I found it quite boring. Maybe it's just me since this book is really popular. I tend to be those people who most often hate popular shows or books haha. I think I got a 100 pages in? Never again! Eh. I don't even want to rate it."
"1009",1008,"Steven Ralph","I think 1984 was a really boring book but it was kinda cool how Big Brother resembled the government today. The government now is similar to the one in 1984 with a few exceptions. Big Brother is in charge of everything and watches your every move, same with the thought police."
"1010",1009,"Shelley","I had wanted to read this book for awhile. It was never part of any required reading for High School, so I kept forgetting about it. I had a really hard time getting into it and understanding and connecting with the characters. I know that this book is a classic and a popular book, but it was definitely not one of my favorites. I forced myself to finish it hoping it would get better but it never did. The one thing I did find amazing about it was that it was written in the 1940's and yet so many things in it have come true and exist in our culture today, almost 70 years later."
"1011",1010,"Rianne Marijke","The author should have written the essay he was itching to write and left out the rest of the story. It's reads like a very long essay with an extra essay dumped in the middle. Not subtle. Failed as a book, but succeeded at being a massive influence on culture. My rating is what I thought of it as a novel. "
"1013",1012,"Viviana","I put the book down at page 36. Anti-utopia stuff just isn't my type. The plot is so grey and non-dimensional... no hook at all to keep readers interested."
"1014",1013,"Donann Vance","I have never given a book a bad review, until now. This was the most boring book I have ever read. I had to force myself through it hoping it would get better. It didn't. It's a very political book. Kind of scary if you think that what happened in the book could really happen. Even with that said, it was still a boring book. "
"1017",1016,"Kristy","While I appreciate the obvious theme of this book, and the fact that Orwell places an importance on propaganda, it was difficult to get through. I am not a science fiction reader by any means, but it was something different. His World reclaimed novel Animal Farm will always be my favorite of this particular author. "
"1022",1021,"Krista","I didn't like this book at all. I was disappointed in the determination Winston. While I have no idea what it feels like to be tortured, and I have never felt pain that was written in this book, but I believe with every fiber of my being that my mind, is my own. I would rather slit my own throat than to let someone brainwash me.However, the tone of the book does make one think about government, personal rights, and politics. How many of our personal rights are we willing to let the government take for security? Is security worth freedom? How long will this country stand by and watch the government take over businesses, mandate businesses to do for those that will not do for themselves, tell individuals who they can and can not marry? It does make one think about the elections we make when we cast our votes. But, enough of my soapbox...I didn't like the book. "
"1024",1023,"Add","One of the most boring books I have ever read. Just goes on and on and nothing unique and exciting about it.:("
"1025",1024,"Louann","Well, this was a beating. Amalie was assigned to read it in high school and liked it. I had enjoyed her other assigned books so I thought, ""Cool!"". Not cool.

Bless her heart for having to to slog through this for a grade."

"1031",1030,"Sandra Hestand","Maybe this was ahead of it's time, at it's time. I thought classics were supposed to hold their value, but this just doesn't. Yeah, yeah Big Brother this, Big Brother that, watch out for the thought police, do your exercises in front of the telescreens...blah blah blah. I mean big brother, thought police, telescreens...this had the potential of being really cool, but it wasn't (what’s up with the two minutes hate thing?). Winston had zero personality, which I'm sure partially came from the oppression, but come on, he was a REBEL, a member of Dumbledore's army!!!! I just didn't care for or about him. The supposed love between him and Julia was equally flat and boring. Every time I got my hopes up that something exciting was going to happen, Orwell dashed them again with another dose of, ""how newspeak came to be,"" or a lesson on who Oceania was at war with. I'm proud to say, I made it to the end, but it wasn't a fun trip. I can honestly say that I unliked this book doubleplusalot."
"1034",1033,"Tanmoy Mondal","The most boring book i have ever read, I don't know how i able to complete it. Some time i felt that i should throw the book. Big brother is watching you and all the plot is very unnatural and unrealistic you can't imagine the situation and what is going on."
"1035",1034,"Jason Pruett","Don't take my 1-star rating to mean you should not read this book. This is definitely something everyone should read as an insight into what society can become when government is given (or takes) too much power and allowed (or takes) too much secrecy."

"1041",1040,"Tara Lynn","I confess, I'm putting this on here even though I only got through HALF of the E-Book. What a load of despressing, nonsensical drivel. The whole point of the human condition is that human repeatedly have risen against themselves and recreated themselves in new images throughout history. I had no way of connecting to the main character, and his so-called love affair with the main female protagonist was embarrassingly agonizing. "
"1044",1043,"Mr. Noah Sturdevant","I'm glad I didn't have to read this in high school. Just not my thing. I appreciate books that make a point about a larger issue, but you don't have to send me running to do shots of bleach to get your point across. To quote a wise, though animated, horse: ""No sir, I don't like it."""
"1045",1044,"Leslie Lindsay","I wanted to like this book. I really did my best, but honestly, I gave up. I got to page 73 or so...and just couldn't get into it. I was very impressed with some of the concepts presented in the book--artificial insemination, for one (book was originally published in 1949). The idea of Newspeak and Oldspeak...fascinating. A little bit about the need to procreate...I am sure Margaret Atwood has read the book as a springboard for some of her deeper ideas in Handsmaid Tale and Orynx and Crake. But, 1984, I just couldn't appreciate. On a sidenote, it was totally fun reading an old copy of this that once belonged to my hubby. He read it in H.S. Embedded within the book was a ""bookmark"" from Gundaker Better Homes & Gardens real estate company, whom his mother worked for! No cell numbers listed back then, only office and residence. Not even a pager. Talk about 1984."
"1046",1045,"B.B. Tamagotchi","Dear Members of the Literati,I hate this book something awful. I’ve never hated a book so much in my entire life.News for you: This book is written by a jaded, old, crabby man who became disillusioned with communism. That’s right, disillusioned, meaning at one time, he thought highly of it, but it didn’t go his way. Why? because communism never does.In the year 2016, everyone thinks Ted Cruz and Trump are raging lunatics who place fear at the top of their agenda to scare everyone their way. Turns out, Orwell is that same guy. He’s the antithesis of an intelligent doomsday prepper, suffering from paranoia, hiding from Chem Trails. Also, if you haven’t read much about him, I recommend taking a glance at his Wikipedia page, and you can see for yourself that he was an asshole who thought highly of himself and his views.This book is long and it’s boring and it’s meant more than anything stir up fear about the Russians in a Cold War era. Lame. "
"1048",1047,"Elena","I'm glad I'm done with the book. Still can't shake it off. Bottom line is, I really didn't like it. So depressing, so... ugh can't even describe it.Scenes of torture described in detail, the pain and such... ugh, I turned pages because I couldn't read it.If you don't like books with bad endings, don't read it."
"1050",1049,"Sabrina","Boring and overrated."
"1051",1050,"Dianmoragui","Please understand that I do acknowledge the fact that this book is basically a masterpiece, I do see why it must be considered a must read and a classic; therefore my low rating cannot be explained as something being wrong with the book, it is more related to how I felt through reading it. I felt horrible reading this and each chapter made me feel worse and worse, and when there was a glimpse of hope it was shattered immediately. Not only did I find finishing this book tortuous, there were times when I just felt bored, yet I finished it because as I said it is quite an interesting book.If you are not the kind of person who is willing to go through a book that will never make you feel good then I simply don't recommend it. "
"1052",1051,"Bryan","I can't believe I hadn't read this book earlier, and that no one had told me just how awful it actually was.I hope you love getting Miniluv'd to tears with exposition and Ken-Levine-grade readings of economics and history. I have to cut Orwell some slack, seeing as this was published in 1949, but all the so-vaunted prescience (and intellectual nuance) drains out under the weight of analysis in a very disappointed way. But lots of exposition makes this feel like an essay, and I guess that scores intelligentsia points, right?The book's appeal, I guess, is that you can manage to see the description of the political dystopia you're most afraid of. Afraid of Bush-era Republican America? Sure. That's in here somewhere, I bet. Terrified of Obama-Stalin leftist death panels? Why not. I bet that's in here somewhere. Because, ultimately, IngSoc itself is a completely humanless reading of politics. So, allusions from everyone -- right, left, center, Vermin Supreme? I don't know, and honestly don't care. This is the McDonald's of dystopian fiction.Just read The Handmaiden's Tale instead if you need to read something dystopian."

"1055",1054,"Ori Pilo Kerman","Wow. That book was just... so...BOOOOOOOOOO-RING!I started reading this book because it's a known ""classic"" and considered to be very good by many people.It took me FOREVER to read it, because it was so dull (though I'm pretty sure some blame goes on the translator).The last chapter of the book (which is roughly 50 pages long...) was somewhat interesting on a psychological level, but until that point, it felt like I was reading a detailed ""historical"" description of how the world came to be in a messed up state of ""Big Brother Government"", where everybody's monitored and there are no things like joy or human interaction. This was made in a VERY boring, uninteresting and depressing way, side-by-side with the ""story"" of Winston, a worker of the government who begins having thoughts of revolt. This ""main plot"" of Winston, however, was poorly done and meant nothing more but to give a personal insight for the reader to emphasize with, as a foundation on which Orwell can present his made-up and over-the-top Big Brother regime. Orwell was probably a lot more enthusiastic on giving a detailed description of this new-possible-future he has thought of, and as a result, Wilson's ""story"" is very shallow and... well, stupid.Besides that, I really like ""possible futures"" genre, but the world Orwell describes feels too farfetched and impossible to actually occur, a thing that really threw me away from enjoying the read.This is NOT a book to read for its plot. The plot itself is just BAD.However, if you can enjoy a detailed description of a universe in which the ""Big Brother Government"" has taken its hold on the people, read this. There are several extreme thoughts and ideas in this book that can really make you think about things like human interaction and what it is to be lead blindly by a selfish government.I, personally, just started skimming whole pages of the book..."

El único merito que tiene este libro fue predecir de cierta forma como los gobiernos, empresas, etc, vigilan, violan la privacidad, manipulan y hostigan las masas. Fuera de eso, ni se le puede llamar siquiera ciencia ficción, no es mas que una distopía politica extremadamente aburrida y tediosa, dificil de terminar... Si no creen lean las primeras 100 paginas, o busquen la crítica de Asimov sobre esta novela(que si es un verdadero referente de la ciencia ficción) Una estrella es mucho.

I even tryed to watch the movie...Well, I'm sorry for any grammatical mistakes (as I said earlyer I'm Italian), and I hope you liked my review :)I'm looking forward to any comments.-Marianna"

And since I prefer to enjoy a book while reading (isn't that what it's all about in the end?) I gave the low ranking.Maybe it's worth it to give it a go and read it once to know what everyone is talking about..which I did and now that classic is off my to read list for good ;)"

I found it confusing and uninteresting and it just could not capture my interest. I will also admit that I was unable to finish 1984. I made it about halfway through the novel and decided I simply could not move any further with reading it. Perhaps the end would have been better and would have been able to save it, but unfortunately I could not continue long enough to find out. "

Frankly the only active one is Big Brother! And three, just focus on the big political idea and how it got this way and quit making random detours!!!!"
"1108",1107,"Linda","I did not really like this book, even though it is proclaimed as a classic of the post-apocolypse genre. I would rather classify it as a socio-political commentary, a reflection on communism, class differences, government, war, etc. But the concept of 'Big Brother is watching you' is now as applicable and even more real with the prevalence of so much personal data on the internet.You have to be willing to think and reflect carefully when reading this book."

"1110",1109,"Carly Casper","1984 is usually touted as a masterful vision of extremism gone mainstream, but don't give it that much credit. It's little more than confirmation bias for the politically disaffected. Orwell, George does a great job of making us feel hella hopeless and futile, but he insists on doing so through a draggy and oft uncomfortable narrative. That's it though. It's not an anarchist's anthem, it's not a communist's mid-revolution pick-me-up; it's a book that paints a picture of a mildly sickening alternate reality, but a reality far less sickening than the one we actually live in."
"1111",1110,"Nate"," When I was told that I could read 1984 by George Orwell for my CP English final, I was extremely excited. As I started reading, I became less and less excited about it. The novel is George Orwell’s pessimistic view of the future if totalitarianism continued around the world. The novel’s main character, Winston Smith, is a man that has become fed up with the oppressive world he lives in, but is too pathetic to do anything about it. Eventually he meets a young girl that is in love with him, and the two meet in secret locations, and despite knowing very little about one another, they make love. They meet only a few times until they are captured by a secret police organization known as The Thought Police. They are captured because premarital sex is against the law. Winston and his colleague Julia are imprisoned, and after a long period of time, during which he is tortured, Winston is let out of prison after he confesses to his past crimes, even though he actually did nothing wrong. After a few days of freedom, Winston is killed by the Thought Police. Despite the novel being considered a classic, I did not like it. I did not like the novel for a few reasons. The first reason is the fact that it seem a little unrealistic. In 1984 even thinking about doing something illegal can get you arrested and even killed. That to me, is just something that could never happen. There is no way that a government could find a way to read people’s minds. Also there are television-like devices called telescreens, which enable government agents to spy on people in their homes and just about everywhere, even the restroom. That to me is just creepy to me to think that someone is always watching someone. The final thing I do not like about the novel is the fact that it is a little long. Sure Orwell had to develop the characters and the plot, but it just gets a little dry because of the length. I did not like the novel, but I am just not a fan of post apocalyptic themed literature, so if you want to read it go right ahead. "

"1115",1114,"Aleah","I did no like it. I did not get the point. Animal Farm, which I loved, was so much better. So many people told me 1984 was a ""really good book!"", but I did not feel it. The characters were so pathetic..."
"1116",1115,"Lexie","One of the worst books I've ever read, and I've read alottt of books. We had to read this for our AP English class and I didn't enjoy it at all. Plus I thought the ending was horrible. I can see why we had to read this for class considering it's a classic, but I wouldn't recommend it for an extra book just to read."

"1123",1122,"Annika","This book is seriously creepy."
"1124",1123,"Stephen M","I once had a really inane and unintelligent review here that drew some trolls and unwanted attention, so I took down that review because I generally hate any kind of negativity and it makes me extraordinarily anxious to have any kind of criticism (constructive or destructive) pop up on my ticker feed on a semi-regular basis (I don't really need that); and it's especially disheartening when that criticism deals with a book that so many intelligent people love. I hope that one day I will return to this book and really grasp what it is that so many people love about it, but until that day, I suppose I can continue bashing it to the discomfort of all of us. My main issue at the time was that the book wanted to argue about these political ideas through a story, and it left me wondering why a story was even necessary in the first place. I think I was pretty reductive in my approach to works that combine artistic expression and politics. However I thought that if the author really wanted to convey a point about a political or social issue, why not resort to the good old, syllogism and debate format? I think the answer to this should be obvious; it should make me look blatantly particularly provocative for having made that point. The reason why it’s a book is because it has reached such a wider audience as a work of fiction, than if it were to be a political essay (which probably would reach only a handful of those in academia and those working in that field of study). It’s hard to deny the impact that this book has had, and how many people it's reached. Who doesn’t use the terms “double-think” or “big brother” when discussing any issues involving oppressive bureaucratic systems, or other similarly related issues? (This doesn’t change that the fact that the book has really boring characters and the writing is bland as hell (and it especially doesn’t change the fact that I love literature that is focused on character and language which is well out of Orwell’s wheelhouse, but I can’t hate on Mr. Orwell too much because the late, great Bonnie, had such affection for him and let’s face it: she was a far more intelligent and thoughtful reader than I was or will be!))It was aspects of its simplicity that I resisted. And not just the simplicity of prose and character, but the simplicity of us versus them, the people vs. Big Brother.I’d like to hear 1984 written from the perspective of Big Brother. The dynamics of government, government control, and the temptation of power is what most interests me the most. I think it’s easy for us, mere individuals and lowly citizens on the bottom of the food chain, to abstract a single oppressive entity, the single “big brother” which has its own motivations and intentions acting as its own agent which oppresses us. But this misses out on a large portion of the truth. Any oppressive system (barring outright Monarchs) came about from a large complicated set of cause and effect which makes it difficult to point to any one person or party who is culpable. I’m sure all the reasons behind any given dictum or law, are extremely complex and this complexity has to render incomprehensible any abstracted notion of a singular entity with nefarious intentions behind it. (Hey Otis, am I still on topic, by the way?!?!)I’d like to hear that story because I think that no matter which perspective you take on any difficult, community-wide (society-wide) issue, it will be seen as “us versus them”; you’ll never get to the real source of what causes all these problems and issues no matter the perspective because you'll see it through the eyes of one person caught up in a society-wide issue (I think this was what Kafka was expressing through a lot of his work). I’d like to put this idea out there because certain fanaticism, while understandable, can get a little out of hand. This says nothing about the rights and wants of any one person or individual within the system, by the way. It says nothing about submitting to authority merely because the dynamics operating within that authority is complicated. I just feel that this is a piece of the puzzle that’s often left out of the conversation (and left out of this book!) What are big brother’s intentions? And how did these rules come about? What conditions brought about these decisions and dictums? What is it about a society that resulted in such oppressive and strict rules?I’d like to read that part of 1984. Maybe Orwell will write a sequel. "
"1126",1125,"The Gatekeeper","I HATED this book. "
"1127",1126,"Books are Great!","This book is literally about a sex addicted drunkard in a dystopian... Future? I don't know, but he basically keep saying he's gonna do something but like, nothing ever happened. He didn't even try! I have never dnf'd a book before until now. What's even more upsetting is that I was very excited to read this originally."
"1131",1130,"Sarah Maddaford","This book was so boring that I couldn't finish it. The concept is truly interesting and frightening at the same time, but the execution of the prose is awful. I was supposed to read this for my English class and it was the only assigned reading during K-12th grades that I could not finish no matter how hard I tried."
"1134",1133,"Zaynah","I hate this book. I hate it. I hate it so much. I hate this book."
"1136",1135,"Stenedria","Usually I'm a fan of dystopia novels, but not particularly fond of this one. It may have to to with the fact that I find politics boring (no offense to people who favor this book and/or politics). I don't understand it and have no real interest in it so I like to avoid the topic when it arises. That's just me. I just couldn't find one thing that I liked which is hard for me to admit because I try to find at least one thing, but it didn't happen. The wife of the main character (Katharine) is shown no mercy by her husband. The government only lets people marry f they share no attraction to one another. That was the only passion present will be for the society. So the main character Winston and Katharine are wed and are filed for separation after they can't produce a child. The whole point to child bearing is to have one more soldier for the government. Poor Katharine. All she wanted to do what she had to do, but couldn't. Winston shows no sympathy and doesn't even know if she's even alive before setting his sights on a much younger woman named Julia. Julia only rebels by satisfying her sexual desires. She has done this once she was 16 years old. Together Winston and Julia break the rules by ""loving each other"" which is against the law in this society. I don't like Julia at all, but I especially don't like that they plan to dwindle down the vocabulary to a point where there is little to no expression with words. Basically adjectives, adverbs, and even some verbs will no longer exist...and they're ok with this because it's what the government wants. The people find beauty in the destruction of words to which I was appalled when I read that part. I marvel at the beauty of words and this society wants to hinder it. As a booknerd/bibliophile, this pains me. Let me not influence you, dear audience. Feel what you wish on the this book. I wanted to like it because I've heard good things, but I couldn't. The only character I like was Katharine and she doesn't even have a real role in the book."
"1138",1137,"Keke","It was boring. So wordy. And half of them didnt even need to be there. No love for the characters. I don't care if a million people call this classic. It is classic. Classically boring."
"1139",1138,"Morgan"," I'm going to make this plain and clear. 1984 was probably the worst book I’ve ever read. Despite the writers purpose of showing the reader what a society controlled by socialism would be like i though he even did a bad job of that. For the first 3/4ths of the book the only thing that happens is a guy is wallowing in his own misery then there is a prostitute then he finds a lady friend, he says he loves her then they get caught, tortured, and end up hating each other. THE END I thought this book totally lacked a sufficient storyline, and any emotional connection. Reading it I felt no connection with either of the characters, and until they got taken hostage and tortured I didn’t care less whether they died or lived in constant hell. The only thing I could comment Orwell on was making the end so utterly horrible and grotesque that it made me both furious and hopeless at the same time. If the book was in fact mine I would be one of the many of my classmates that will be burning this book. In no state would I ever recommend this book to anyone of any age."

The book was not that intresting because there was to many hard words that I did not understand,the book was just plain boring because the good part is all the way at the end of the book, and the setting is not that intresting. The setting is in london and it is about hte past. The book is about a guy named winston living in a world that is being controlled by the big brothers and they want to make the worlds a better place by taking over peoples minds and there beliefs. It was not that really good to read , but if you sound intrested you should give it a try and read the book."
"1148",1147,"Laura Walmer","Such a depressing book. I'd always heard stuff about Big Brother is watching you kind of stuff and how close we are to that now with our GPS and little chips you can put a chip in your child so if they're ever lost or kidnapped you can find them again. But the book goes way beyond that to controlling the way we think and that you can't trust anyone and the inability to tell what is truth. YUCK! Did not leave any happy thoughts whatsoever."
"1149",1148,"e","well...really? there was something far too dry about this novel.The concept,the microcosms = great.the writing, the passion= not so great.this book had no colour, which of course, was the point- but Orwell did that a bit too well- I couldn't get involved- it didn't give me that feeling a book normally gives me. but now I know what everyone was talking about ( I had a cool highschool english teacher who let us pick which books we wanted to read) ; and will understand any forthcoming pompous attempts at proving their scholarly-ness! HA!but the good news is, I paid 50 cents for it, and the cover of the edition I have is hilarious!"

It made me angry, but I don't think in the way it intends to. Orwell's prose simply went on and on and on and on and on. I didn't feel anything for the characters, I honestly didn't care if they lived or died. It was painful to read. I was determined to finish it since it is such an important book, but I definitely didn't want to. I'm just glad that I never had to read it in school where I would have had to write a paper on it, or take a test about it, or talk about it with a class. Ugh."
"1153",1152,"Dakar Parada Pacheco","slow and boring"
"1154",1153,"Adeelizabeth","The best thing I can say about this book is that the parallel to our society was errie. I was unsatisfied with this reading experience and I don't think it's one of those that isn't good, but because of what it stands for or what it teaches you should still read it. I don't think it's worth reading for any reason, but that's me."
"1155",1154,"Jess","Alas, Orwell fails to evoke the same sympathy for his human characters in 1984 that he manages with his charming and oh-so-human animals. Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert!

"1162",1161,"Demie Huffman","I thought that it was interesting how the society was totalitarianism disquised as socialism. Towards the end of the book, O'Brien said how the totalitarian societies fell apart, and how the current society had learned from these mistakes. The only thing that changed was that the government pretended that everyone excluding the Inner Party was equal, except the Proles. This deceit enabled the government to get away with grossly mistreating its citizens and the never-ending destruction of evidence prevented people from realizing what was happening. The government in this book succeeded where Hitler failed- brainwashing the people.I struggled through parts of this book, especially when it was describing the society, because it seemed to repeat itself a lot and state the obvious. All in all, however, I thought it was a fairly decent book."
