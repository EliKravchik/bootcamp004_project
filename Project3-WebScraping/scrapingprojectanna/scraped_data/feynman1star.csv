63,Jade Heslin,"This is one of the most boring things I have ever read in my life. Before beginning this gruelling collection of anecdotes, I had never even heard of Nobel Prize winner Richard Feynman. I’m not very good at science, particularly physics, so this book was far too technical for me. I thought it was supposed to be lighthearted and funny. Instead, it was a collection of really dull, self-satisfied yarns with a common theme: how Feynman is so much better at everything than everybody else. Safecracking, painting, maths problems, fixing broken radios – whatever it is, Richard has done it, and not only has he done it but he has enjoyed rubbing his genius in the faces of those unfortunate enough to be around him. He’s a highly intelligent man, but he is also a self-aggrandising know-it-all prick who has little in the way of modesty. These stories often build up and build up, and you get the feeling that there is a punchline coming (there must be some sort of a pay-off for listening to this twit ramble on for pages), but it never comes. Twit? But how can somebody who has won such a prestigious award for his contribution to physics be considered a twit, Jade? Well, because he just is, okay? He has absolutely no idea about real things and real people. He has the social skills of a ball of lint, and most importantly – he doesn’t realise that he is boring. He is like the dullard that sits next to you on the train and witters on for hours about mundane, trivial nonsense, as though it is the most riveting tale you are ever likely to hear - all the while, completely oblivious to the fact that you are edging away slowly, yawning and looking out of the window. In his mind, he is enthralling.The one part of the story that he should be proud of – the winning of the Nobel Prize – he plays down and acts as though it was such a burden and an inconvenience to him. He is more interested in telling us about the time he learnt how to pick up girls than telling us of his wife’s death, which is mentioned only briefly as an aside.I actively dislike this man, and I hope to never have to hear another of his rip-roaring, side-splitting, thigh-slappingly hilarious anecdotes again."

120,Kururu,"I feel that Feynman's character is sort of a mythos or legend of science and physicists because he was so peculiar. From what I've noticed this peculiarity has transfigured into some demi-god aura or status.The book definitely helps substantiate that aura but it also cuts away from it. First off, we can tell that he is intensely curious, like all great scientists, and that leads to awkward situations. My favourite story, or rather factoid, is the one where he proves that urination doesn't use gravity by peeing whilst doing a handstand. But that curiosity also creates an unnecessary tension at times. Like when he was taking a stand by not giving receipts for his travel fees. He seemed like, at a lot of times in this book, childish and foolish, rebelling against the man for no real reason. I was stupefied that someone as smart as him couldn't see past himself for one second, but as the book illustrates at times, he remains very arrogant and pompous. Another character flaw that was quite evident was his apparent misogynistic attitude. There were several events littered throughout the book from that self-help ""all girls are whores"" to trolling waitresses that spelled it out.Finding character flaws in a book like this was the most interesting part of the read. That even though this book is part of geeklore and was written posthumously as a memoir, which you'd expect to laud him and his genius endlessly, he remains as human as ever."

178,Nick,"One of the problems with reading a book written by a genius is that you have to ask yourself whether any perceived deficiencies in the text are due to the author, or due to your own failure to comprehend his brilliance. That said, I wasn't thrilled by this book. On a purely technical level, it would have benefited from a stronger editor. While there's a rough chronological order to the material, there tends to be a lot of jumping around both within and between the chapters. A few times, Feynman would relate some post-WWII anecdote, only to jump back to something that happened during his time at Los Alamos in the early 1940s. He'll mention that he divorced his second wife, and then shortly thereafter tell a story set during the marriage. It gives the book a very disjointed quality.On a more personal level, Feynman just doesn't strike me as someone you'd want to spend time with. About 30% of his stories talk about a time he pulled a fast one on somebody, or how he did something arrogant and obnoxious and it developed into an incident. Reading this book feels like babysitting a very rambunctious toddler--as amusing as his antics may be, you're can't help but looking forward to it being over. And while it's perhaps unfair to judge his behavior by modern standards, some of the womanizing and borderline misogyny (as when he decides that the best way to pick up women in bars is to treat them badly and call them whores) is a bit disappointing. Feynman's scientific accomplishments may be beyond reproach, but I doubt I'll spend any more time with his memoirs."

Like his thoughts on the ethics of nuclear weapons. His role in the Manhattan project. Hell he has several chapters on how to get women in bed but not on how the McCarthy era affected science and intellectualism. I wanted to know what really went down from someone SANE who was really there to witness it. Instead it's mostly just funny anecdotes from his life. I was disappointed."

I love William Hurt, and his character in the movie, Dr. Richard Feynman, was incredibly interesting. So - Wikipedia. Wow. I borrowed the book, and another one from a friend and started to read. Yes, this guy is cool, and genius, and interesting, but it seems above all he is a self-proclaimed prankster/joker at heart. And I'm having trouble dealing with that aspect. I'm struggling with it and have put the book down for now."

I'm a big sience fan, and I've always heard how brilliant and funny Richard Feynman was, especially because of his connection to the UofC. But I loathed this book. I suppose it's a memoir, and I don't know if it's ghost written or not, but what was supposed to endear me to Mr Feynman made him revolting to me. According to this book, he treated other people like dirt and thought it was hilarious, he correlated pure intelligence with worth, and he dismissed and disrespected everyone who he felt was not as intellectual as he was (and being that he was a genius, that was most of everybody). Perhaps this is melodramatic, but he sickened me a touch. His blatant disrespect for the work of other scholars in the guise of a patronizing outlook is wholly demoralizing, and for people who wished to pursue a degree in the sciences under him I can't even imagine what it was like to deal with his pomp and ego. I know that the persona displayed in memoirs is different than the actual personality of a person, but the gleeful manner in which he presents his attitude does nothing to disprove my issues with his style.

292,Amber Dunten,"I totally agree with Emily, the top reviewer with 113 comments, most of them chastising her for not loving this book, and many of them trying to imply she's simply not smart enough to appreciate Feynman if she doesn't love it. Without attempting to demean or diminish Feynman's actual brilliance and greatness as a scientist, I declare: this book is annoying as shit. Without dismissing the many very real talents Mr. Feynman had, I'm not convinced that compelling and empathetic writing was one of them. I'm aware this book is little more than a compilation of interviews with Feynman, so perhaps the blame there lies with his co-author/editor, who took Feynman too much at his literal word and failed to effectively work the many anecdotes into a pleasing and well-written whole. I'm told Feynman was a very likeable guy, but the guy who comes across in these anecdotes seems to me to be only likeable in small doses. He seems bombastic, overbearing, even a bit grandiose in his manner, despite paying lip service to modesty – and by this, I don't just mean he spends too much time bragging about how clever he is, which he also does. Don't bother dinging me for saying this by pointing out that he IS pretty goddamn clever and has earned some bragging rights - I'm aware of that, and I don't care. He could be the smartest person in the history of the world, but braggadocio is still not an attractive habit. And don't try to tell me it's an essential quality of an autobiography, either. I've read other autobiographies where people spend upward of 300 pages talking about themselves without making me want to punt them.No, I sense something deeper in Feynman's manner of speaking that says to me, This person is utterly arrogant and yes, self-aggrandizing. (Emily's word.) It strikes me as the sound of someone who's spent too much of his life with his fanboys hanging on his every word, so that now he thinks every word that comes out of his mouth is actually worth hanging on. This may be a justifiable mistake for someone in Feynman's position, but that doesn't make it any less a mistake. In fact, I think it's a mistake that is at the heart of this book – the concept of, “It's Feynman, so of COURSE we can just compile a bunch of interviews with him about random shit he did one time, put them in chronological order, and it'll be great!”And I don't find Feynman nearly as funny, endearing, or even interesting as he thinks he is. To be fair, I admit he seems from afar like a terribly interesting man, but I quickly discovered I do NOT want to spend 11 solid hours listening to him tell seemingly random and generally trivial stories about episodes in his life. One or two anecdotes may be mildly entertaining, but his style gets old in a hurry, and his sense of humor seems downright mean-spirited at times. Perhaps my mistake was in attempting to vread it straight through – I don't really have any other way to vread. But you can only vread so many anecdotes about experimenting with ants and their pheromone trails or working on broken radios as a kid before you realize each one may be slightly interesting, but when you put them all together in a row, their total interest value doesn't accumulate. Meanwhile, Feynman's annoyance value DOES. Therefore, I recommend this book (a) in small doses, say for example as light bedtime reading, or (b) for those on the “Feynman can do no wrong” bandwagon. This latter group is his true audience – the ones who are delighted to hang on every word that comes out of his mouth. And I suspect that in the latter half of his life, he moved through a world so surrounded by those people that he forgot there was anything else. I could be wrong – maybe it's not Feynman's fault at all, and this isn't really him. This could be just the aspect of him that's been asked to sit down in front of a microphone and tell every story about himself that he can think of. When your friends tell you that your war stories are so awesome they should be compiled and published as a book, is there any other way it can really come out?Audio notes: The audio version is not helped by a narrator who seems to be sort of channeling Feynman's manner of speaking – his rhythms and intonations, though not his accent or timbre – and it makes a slightly annoying series of anecdotes that much MORE annoying and somewhat duller than the material itself would warrant. I pulled up recordings of Feynman's lectures and more casual interviews, and there's enough of a match to his casual speech patterns that I think it's intentional. But it's as though the narrator learned to imitate Feynman by listening to him speak a single sentence, and then he just repeats that sentence over and over. Every sentence has the exact same rhythm and intonation as the one before it, and it's all a little too fast and perky, so it's like being forced to spend 11 hours listening to a salesman's patter. Somewhere between that and Chinese water torture."

362,Jeremy Howe,"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman Review""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" is a curious, well informed book. However it is lacking in many different departments, enough so that it made the book feel lifeless, boring, and empty. The book is basically about Richard Feynman, a pretentious, wise-cracking physics professor, and all of his adventures. He travels around the world, doing physics and stuff, and has an ending. The book has a rather straightforward beginning, sags on and feels clunky in the middle, and practically has no ending. The structure of the book itself felt empty.Feynman writes in a way that feels boring and hollow. He glazes over his interactions with other people and the world around him. Huge occasions are glazed over in a matter of sentences. Some might enjoy this because he focuses mostly on the science, but the book feels non-human. This book is supposed to be a biography, but in reality, we didn't learn that much about Feynman! When something happened, it simply happened, there is little to no reaction; this tells us nothing about Feynman and prevents us from connecting to the author.Before reading ""Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman!"" I read over the reviews. I personally felt disappointed when reading it. No it is not ""laugh out loud funny"". I found myself smiling, and saying to myself ""that is funny"", but I never actually laughed. It felt more like a witty pun, not funny enough to make you laugh, but enough to make you smirk and comment on how ridiculous it was.There will also be many readers who will get lost. One thing I can say about Feynman is that he can really explain scientific topics in a way that sounds casual and understandable. However, he goes into subjects that wash completely over my head; and due to the fact he spends so much time talking about science I feel like I was wasting his time by not understanding it.Overall I did not like the book, and I know I have valid reasons. The book felt empty, hollow, and generally uninteresting. Though Feynman is good at explaining scientific topics, it hurts the book in that he glazes over crucial events in his life. Feynman also has a very negative attitude, I perceived him to be pretentious, nosey, and uninteresting. Feynman seemed to be an old man that was trying to impress his grandson (the reader) by acting “cool”, which does not impress the child because what old man thinks is cool is too boring and pure to be what the child perceives to be “cool”.Bizarre analogies aside, I would not recommend this book to even a science lover. It is hard for me to say, because personally I am fascinated by the Manhattan project, but the book was simply boring.1 / 5 Stars"

The stories were written down by someone else and they are flat. What's missing is the ""in person"" experience - participating in the crowd's reaction, watching his body language and facial expression and listening to his voice as it shows emotion. "

This rambling, disjointed and poorly written ""memoirs"" of Richard Feynman (a noted physicist in the mid part of the 20th century) really demonstrates what everybody knows: if mankind is to continue to perpetuate itself, dorks like physicists must remain in the ""useful minority"", lest the apes (or maybe dolphins) succeed us as the dominant species on the planet. Seriously, this guy is like the king of all dorks. A complete social misfit, and while his stories show some insights into his peculiar, one-track mind, he should never be seen as anything like a role model. He is more like a minor curiosity, and this book is not worth the time I spent on it. I'll place it in my collection of wussytopia books, next to Atlas Shrugged and Herland."

Vse spoštovanje do gospoda Feynmana, izjemna osebnost je; toda saj sam priznava,da mu branje knjig in pisanje spisov nikoli ni šlo od rok ... Kljub temu da je njegovo življenje nadvse zanimivo, bi bilo bolje najeti biografa, ki bi ga ubesedil v njegovem imenu. Besedilo je popolnoma nepovezano, povsod ga je polno, ni ne repa ne glave. Knjiga naj bi bila smešna, duhovita, v resnici je pa v njej toliko duhovičenja, celo nekoliko žaljivega, občasno tudi nekakšnega hvalisanja, da je zame neprebavljiva. "

It basically consists of a man who boasts about how great he is at everything he tries. It gets old very fast. Also, very little of it actually revolved around science. A good deal of it was just about his love life. And his various escapades with random women. I, personally, did not feel that it was necessary to describe every woman who ever spent the night with him and how he seduced them. Personal opinion."

599,Bloomreader,"I fully expected to love this book, especially given the author's indisputable brilliance and high scores on GoodReads. Instead, I had to throw it aside after reading only 1/3 of it -- very, very unusual for me. I think this book is a classic example of how sometimes even extremely intelligent authors don't necessarily have what it takes to capture a reader. While I didn't mind the way his adventures were recounted (almost like they were transcribed from taped sessions) I so hated Feynman's arrogant, boastful tone that I couldn't get through the book. The overriding theme seemed to be, ""Look at how much smarter I am than everyone else, and how easily they fall for my [kinda dumb] 'jokes'!"". Someone should have performed an ego excision on this author before he set about attempting this book. Is he a brilliant, eccentric genius? No doubt. Would I waste several more minutes of my precious life subjecting myself to Feynman's smug, egocentric ramblings? NO!"

The guy is one of the greatest scientists of the XXth century, he worked on the Atomic Bomb in Los Alamos, discovered incredible things about the Big Bang and radioactivity and lived through exciting times but his stories are neither interesting, nor well written. Feynman seems to believe he is very funny and very clever (and he says so himself very often in the book). Maybe true but usually a bad combination that comes out both conceited and uninteresting in an autobiography. Most of the stories sound like Band Camp's in American Pie: you don't see the point and you feel a bit uncomfortable just to hear about them. He is obviously sexually obsessed and misogynist and in need of some kind of therapy. I'm not sure he grasped the level of exasperation to which his driving his readers. I'm far from being a Nobel Prize winner but even I can recognise bad prose and a less than average book. The only possible explanations that I have are (1) that the book must have read differently in 1985 when it was first published and (2) it sounds better as an audio book so you don't really focus too much on the extremely poor literary style. In the end, he just produced a very boring ode to himself. Where is Bill Bryson when you need him?"

I could not believe the tales of tricking women into sleeping with him, asking students to pose nude for sketches, and lengthy descriptions of how no one else knows how to think. I was not inspired or impressed by his antics AT ALL. No wonder why there are so few women in physics. The only thing that made this slightly interesting is the window it gave me into a genius-brain.
