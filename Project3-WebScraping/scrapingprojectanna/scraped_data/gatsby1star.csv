"5",4,"Chanice","Absolutely hated this book, I read it in high school maybe my hate is because I read it in high school as an assignment but I hated it lol I can't stress that enough"
"6",5,"Karl Pendlebury","It seems unfair of me to review or rate this book since I only managed to get to page 2 before wanting to rip my eyes out and shove them down the authors throat... With it being such a classic everybody raved about (and with the movie making it even bigger) I thought I'd give it a try... However after getting bored of every other word being too try hard descriptive I realised this book wasn't for me... The style of writing just doesn't sit comfortably with me...I'm sure it's a brilliant book for those who enjoy this type of thing, but I'll pass..."

"8",7,"Esther Rigby","I was greatly disappointed in this book. I did not like it at all!"
"9",8,"Casey","It's not that the writing in this book is bad, Fitzgerald is a good writer. But for me I need to at least care about the characters a little bit, and I didn't even care about Gatsby himself. I honestly didn't sympathize with all these people running around, sleeping (or wanting to do so) with those they weren't espoused to. Unfortunately, I really despised this book. My favorite part was when it was over. No, I'm not saying I don't like it to seem cool, or because I didn't understand it; it just didn't catch me. I can understand where other people might like it though."

"16",15,"ablomof","به نظر من گتسبی بزرگ از نقطه نظر داستانی چیزی برای ارائه نداشت و با توجه به اینکه در زمان انتشار و مدتها بعد از آن مورد توجه قرار نگرفت اما اکنون دلیل توجه بیش از حد به این کتاب واقعا جای سوال دارد؟ "
"18",17,"Morten","Droppede den hurtigt. Sagde mig ikke noget. Ligesom filmen."
"20",19,"Thomas","I really can't stand this book, which is a shame since so many others love it. While I've thouroughly enjoyed reading and listening to analyses of Fitzgerald's most famous text, I found the language in the book to be dry and the plot to be less than interesting."
"21",20,"Kim Shears","I hated this book - maybe if I read it again now I would like it, but that probably isn't going to happen. "
"22",21,"Krish Domingo","What have I just read? I hated (loathed, even) about 90% of this book. Gatsby was weak. Daisy was a slut. Tom was a jerk. I liked Jordan a little. Nick was okay. But I can't, for the life of me, figure out how this book became one of the favorite books of all time. Maybe in a few years, I'm gonn try reading this again. But now, I'm not sure, I think its overrated."
"23",22,"Sandi","It may be a classic American novel, but I hate it! The rich and the self indulgent"
"24",23,"Austin Morris","The Great Gatsby was a long but good book. It starts out with Nick, looking to live the american dream. Nick moves to New York and ends up moving next door to a very rich man, named Jay Gatsby. Gatsby lives on one side of the bay and on the other side lives Gatsby's cousin, Daisy. Daisy is married to a buthole dude named Tom. From there this whole story unfolds with drama and suspense everywhere. this book is a well thought out novel. I wouldn't recommend this book to a young audience, because it was a bit confusing to read. I would recommend this book to a 13+ audience. This is a good book if you're looking for a jack of all genres type of book. I rate this a 7.74 out of 10."
"26",25,"Jeremiah Depta","A great piece of crap. Highly over rated. The paper should be used to insolate dog houses, providing you hate your dog."

"30",29,"Leanne","Stupid. Waste of paper and ink."
"31",30,"Abigail Vaerten","I did not like this book one bit. Some people see it as a beautiful love story, but in my opinion this book is about a stalker who doesn't want to give up a girl that he has already lost. I guess I may have analyzed the book too much, but that was still my interpretation regardless. I was not a huge fan of this book. My opinion of this book did improve, however, after I saw the new movie. I felt that the movie complimented the book very well and it made me actually enjoy the story, I would recommend reading this book before you go see the movie, but I still do not think I would go around telling people to read this book just because."
"32",31,"Scott Cormier","After reading the great Gatsby, I thought the great Gatsby was an awesome book. I enjoyed reading the book, I found the book to be very interesting and I thought it has very few boring parts of the book, I thought that the ending of the book was very very surprising. the vocabulary used by the author was a little challenging but overall I found that the great Gatsby was an awesome book!"
"33",32,"Christie","I was bored. I really don't understand why it is such a classic."
"34",33,"Matthew","Very well written. I just hate Gatsby."
"35",34,"Rachel d.","i was annoyed the entire time at the frivolity of the wealthy. There was something i just couldn't break through. i hated this book. i may be missing a point, but it is difficult in any way to relate to or imagine myself in this story."
"36",35,"Kenny Turpen","Wow, the Dumb Gatsby is more like it. No real story line here except a faint jumbled love triangle or hexagon... I couldn't quite tell. I don't have a clue how this story is a ""Classic""."
"37",36,"Raspbewwies","For all this book was hyped up to be, it fell woefully flat. The characters were two dimensional and boring, the prose, although well flowing, failed to engage me at all. I understand the two dimensionality was supposed to be some kind of allusion to the pretentiousness of the Rocking Twenties, but I believe stories must speak, and to do that they must have characters that speak. This was, in its very essence, a love story and not a social commentary that built up to an antimclimax and, for want of a better phrase, fell face first into the floor. We are given little to no insight into Daisy's character - what makes her *her*- instead confronted with a decision she chooses. That's it. There is no story for Daisy, she seems like a prop for Gatsby to make it apparent to us that he's a hopeless romantic that (in apparently what is the twist of the story) does not get the girl. "
"39",38,"Krissy","Well, this was my first, ever, audio book. I can't hold it against the book for really disliking the narrator. He made it very hard to follow and sometimes hear the story. That said I was not at all captivated by the story. I found it extremely boring. "
"41",40,"Esenzassenza","Highly Overrated"
"42",41,"Olenka","I don't like it a lot. I expected more or maybe just chose wrong time for this book."
"45",44,"Collette Lee","I this it on my own my sophomore year of high school and couldn't stand it. I said as much to my mom and she assured me that it was one of those books that benefitted from reading it with a class. We read it for junior English. I still hated it."
"46",45,"Danae Brittan","The Great Gatsby was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald during the Roaring Twenties. The story takes place in 1922 on Long Island. Nick Carraway gets invited to visit his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom. He is invited to have dinner with the Buchanans. There, he meets Jordan Baker, a woman who he finds interesting and attractive. Jordan tells Nick that Tom Buchanan has a mistress, Myrtle Wilson.Nick is then invited to a prestigious party at his next-door neighbor’s house, Jay Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby comes to Nick and tells him about his secret love for Daisy. The two were in love before Jay was drafted into the war, which ended their relationship. Now that he has returned, he wants Daisy back, even though she is married and has a child. He requests that Nick would help him by inviting Daisy over to have tea with Nick. Unbeknownst to Daisy, Gatsby is already at Nick’s house when she arrives. Daisy is uncomfortable when she sees Gatsby, and the rest of the afternoon becomes very awkward. After they become more comfortable with each other, they fall in love again and become romantically involved.Tom becomes suspicious when he notices romantic glances between Daisy and Gatsby. He suggests that they all go into town in an attempt to break up the romantic tension between Daisy and Gatsby. They drive into town in two separate cars – Tom and Daisy in Gatsby’s car and Gatsby, Nick and Jordan in Tom’s car. They go to a suite at the Plaza Hotel. Tom confronts Gatsby in front of Daisy, Nick and Jordan about being in an affair with his wife. Gatsby doesn’t deny it and neither does Daisy. Gatsby argues with Tom that Daisy only loves him and that Daisy never loved Tom and was just marrying him to get over Gatsby. Daisy admits that she does love Gatsby, but that she also loves Tom. Daisy implies that she is not going to leave Tom for Gatsby. Then Tom tells Gatsby to use his own car to take Daisy home to East Egg. While driving home, Gatsby’s car hits and kills Myrtle Wilson, Tom’s lover, in a hit-and-run accident.Several days later, after the investigation, a witness identifies the hit-and-run car as Gatsby’s. George Wilson is so distraught that he finds Gatsby and shoots him, killing him. He then turns the gun on himself, committing suicide. Nick then moves back to where he came from, and Daisy and Tom also move away from the area and live out their rich aristocratic lives to the bitter end.=======I really hated this book. It sucked. The author should never have written anything. The book lacked in entertainment, explosions, car chases, and comedy. Not to mention that it had excessive amounts of reality-TV-show-type drama, unrealistic consequences, and characters who have exaggerated emotional problems.I understand that F. Scott Fitzgerald was trying to get his point across about the irrational perils of unfaithfulness, but those series of events were just too ridiculous. I would not recommend this book to any of my friends, with the exception of Juliana, because she obsesses over the hit M-Tv show, Jersey Shore."

"48",47,"Jeanie","Even though I read this book in high school, I decided to give it another read. I know it's a "" classic"" (really?) I still found it boring."
"49",48,"Roxy Wilde","Giving it another go....Nope, just can't do it."
"51",50,"Ann Ely","I know this is loved by many. I had to read it college and didn't like it. I tried a couple of times to read it as an adult. Couldn't get through it. Watched the movie with Leonardo DeCaprio and while it was visually quite a spectacular movie, I didn't like Gatsby. So, I am done with this book. "
"52",51,"Matt Holmes","I hated it. I know that's not a popular opinion to have.I'm not hating it to be edgy. I thought Catcher in the Rye was overrated (to a Nirvana degree), but I didn't hate it.I hated this book, and Fitzgerald, and his crazy-ass wife Zelda, and I'm disappointed in Leo by association.Sorry."
"54",53,"S. Woods","This book was all fine and dandy, but I probably didn't enjoy it as much as the average book-lover did. I don't know! It was alright."
"55",54,"Juno","Bleh... Didn't like this one AT ALL. I'm never really interested when it comes to books about this time period. It just doesn't appeal to me. Which made this book almost impossible to finish. "
"56",55,"Meshell","Hated this book. I'm not sure why it's required reading for most high schoolers. Read it for my junior year of high school."
"57",56,"Hfro","i HATED this book. i read it in high school, so it was a while ago and i can't give you specific reasons, but i do know i hated it. "
"58",57,"Leliel Mitsukai","Poor little rich kids and their self-absorbed troubles. I couldn't work up any sympathy for the characters at all. Nouveau Riche vs old money, marrying for money means losing out on Love... I Just. Don't Care."
"59",58,"Nikki Solomon","I read this book at school, and had to dismantle every sentence in the usual English Literature fashion....so I wasn't very impressed with it!"
"60",59,"Lee Pfahler","I read this book a long time ago in high school and did not understand it then. Maybe I should try it again some day, but I will not promise!"
"61",60,"Chasity","This was not a book for me. I spent a lot of time trying to re- read parts of the book because I had no idea what I had just read. I never felt a connection to any of the characters. The story is just so odd."
"62",61,"Trent","I decided to reread this book, for the first time in at least 30 years, because I saw the trailer for Baz Luhrman's forthcoming 3D version. It looks so hideous (so overproduced) that I thought I had better renew my fond memories of the novel before this film obliterated them. Big mistake!Unfortunately, there's always a risk when you revisit a favorite--that it won't hold up to your memories of it. What once seemed ethereal and resonant to me was underdeveloped and sketchy. It's much shorter than I remembered and seems to end about 30 pages after it finally gets started. There's a lot of moodiness in the writing and you have to take a lot on faith--the main character remains a cipher, and certainly not interestingly enigmatic. The whole book strikes me as more like rough notes for a novel than a real novel."
"63",62,"Christina","I read it in high school, and really liked it. I read it again recently since the movie was coming out. The characters were horrible people who did horrible things. I am surprised that I read the entire book. I definitely did not see the movie."
"65",64,"Rayroy","I just hated it, maybe one star is harsh being that I didn't read all of it and it's short and I tried, look F.Scott Fitzerald was a great writer but so was Sherwood Anderson and Knut Hamsun, look I'm not a fan of the so called Lost Generation of 1920's writers, look for me Great American Lit or what I like started with Saul Bellow , or after the crash or post Second World War. Maybe it's just me but I feel this is classic lit for people who read less the five books a year if they read one a year, I was bored with reading it in High School and bored with reading it in my late twenties. East Egg, Long Island, West Egg, I just don't care, read ""Winesburg,Ohio"", ""The Adventures of Augie March"", ""Revolutionary Road"", or ""The Man With the Golden Arm"" Or even ""Green Eggs and Ham"".  Oh the moive is 3-D, doesn't even have fucking Jazz music in it, looks like multi billion doller commerical for make-up. Fuck the movie so it's going to be awful but hey you can go to Brooks Brothers and get a Gatsby suite, what the fuck!!Well the movie comes out today, it's going to suck!"
"66",65,"Skye","I had to read this for school, that should tell you a lot. It was jumpy and tells the story of terrible people. I'll admit I enjoyed it more after we discussed it in class but not a book I'd recommend just to read."
"67",66,"Koohiki","We read this is school and I definatly didnt like it. it was short, only 9 chapters long. Although chapter 7 should have been split into two because I remember it was the longest chapter I have ever read in my life. The book was all about affairs and people killing other people becuase they cheated on them and all this crap and it totally sucked. I would never read this book again. "
"68",67,"Lewis Allan","Was really not interested in this book, pointless description for a scene that I found weren't too interesting, very good in the sense of getting to know the characters their thoughts and beliefs but the actual storyline and plot etc was so boring, I'm surprised I made it past halfway let alone actually finish this book in the hope it will grab my attention."
"69",68,"Ceci","Just wasn't the book for me. Couldn't relate with nor grasp the characters. Story was too ambiguous at the start to where it leaves the reader struggling to figure out (and not in a good way) who the characters are...disappointing to me to read a ""classic"" at this point and not be able to find it fantastic."
"70",69,"Wicak Hidayat","didn't really read this one. it was, well, boring for me. just one of those books that i buy at a used-book spot and then discard on the shelves at home. hmm, wonder why i keep doing that."

"76",75,"Haley Beebe","Despised it. I read this for English class and I hated it from page one. I I think the whole 20's setting is a little too old for a 10th grader to be able to relate to. We did endless research on the era but for a lot of my classmates, they were zoned out and couldn't care less about the 20's.I hated hated hated Daisy and Jay. Hated them. I also hated Nick. He was pointless. Terrible book for our age. "
"77",76,"Julia Putnam","I don't understand. This is said to be F. Scott Fitzgerald's greatest work. It is also said that Mr. Fitzgerald is one of America's most important authors. If that is really true than I am sad for America.I don't understand what is so wonderful about this book. I don't understand how people love it. It's an over-written essay about the rich jerk-offs of the past! All anyone does is drink, talk shit or cheat on each other! How is that important? Why is that considered classic?I realize and completely acknowledge that I'm not a fan of the flowery writing. I would rather an author just say it - get to the point rather than talk around it with ""gorgeous"" adjectives, similes and metaphore. But putting that aside, I don't know what there is to like about any of the characters - at all - they are all horrible people! I don't wish any of them well - not one! I'm completely flummoxed as to why people like it and why it's considered an American classic - much like Wuthering Heights... I just do not get it..."
"78",77,"Gabby","For everyone who defines this book as ""a great love story"", I have to ask what kind of screwed up version of love have you got? For me, this novel had nothing whatsoever to do with love. What it does deal with is the notion that the rich can do whatever they like (in Fitzgerald's time) and suffer no repercussions. It's also testament to the fact that you cannot buy your way into elite, entitled circles no matter what form of ruse you use. For me, this novel was far too cynical, while also being hopelessly naive, to be a love story. Perhaps that's because there wasn't 't one single character worth liking much less loving. Maybe the reader was supposed to be so busy trying to find one worthwhile character that we were too preoccupied to notice the rampant racism and anti-semitism, and just for good measure the tons of elitist balderdash thrown in for good measure. For me, Daisy was a vapid, worthless woman who couldn't pull off the victim tag if her life depended upon it. I think that's because Fitzgerald simply didn't know how to write characters who had any kind of redeeming qualities. All his people were insufferably self-involved, and, amazingly, none of them seemed to have experienced something called consequences for their actions. For some, the over-stuffed prose Fitzgerald writes may be ""brilliant"". For me it was simply one long whine interrupted occasionally (very occasionally) by a lucid thought. However, there were not enough of the latter to make me want to recommend this book to anyone. I read this book in high school and thought the years between now and then may have changed my perspective. What I have realized is that I was smarter than I thought I was in high school."

Besides, there's that fancy moving picture coming out with The Struttin' D taking up the role of The Great G.Seven or eight years after reading this for high school, what are my thoughts now?Still pretty fuckin' boring. OH GOD HOW UNAMERICAN OF MEAlright, that's a lie. A little has changed. For instance, when I read it the first time, I hated everybody but Nick. After finishing it this time, I hate everybody but Jordan, especially Daisy.Look, I understand that this book is supposed to be steeped in symbolism. But you know what else is steeped in symbolism? Everyday language. When you say a word like ""the car"", are you actually throwing a car out of your mouth? No. You're making reference to it, the sounds and letters that form the word ""car"" are the symbols that object lives through vicariously.And most of everyday language is also boring. I mean, yes, it makes pleasant conversations and it's wonderful and beautiful and nothing quite takes your breath away like talking to somebody amazing (I'm looking at you, Melanie). But would I expect these things I hold so closely to myself, like discussing the divine glory of Bosco sticks, to be something a whole community of people should adore and revel in like me? Not really.And that's where it falls for me. Fitzgerald's message is not appealing to me, nor is his presentation. And without the weight of just a good, ol' fashion story, there's nothing for me to grab hold of while I ride this train full of flappers to New York. Thanks for the ride, but I'm hopping off at the next stop."

I didn't like, more like loathed, Daisy, Nick, Tom, Gatsby and Jordan- which if you have read the book you know are the characters that you probably need to at least like in order to enjoy this book; but none of them appealed to me in the least especially with everything that they did and the decisions that they made.None of them had any redeeming qualities for their actions either. I disliked almost every decision that was made by any of them which led to my severe dislike of this book.It's one of those books that you read because it's a classic and form your own opinion of and sadly this was horrible.

Unlike Fitzgerald - the way women are treated in Gatsby gives away a general attitude which I cannot approve of. True, there were some landscape descriptions I enjoyed; apart from that, frankly, it's 'writing for men' and basically sucks. Sorry, just my opinion."

"108",107,"Alicia O'Carrick","Attempted re-read: November 2015Fuck it. This book is worse than I remember. I'm going to SparkNotes.----------------------------------------First read: December 2014No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.(Starting with this one, I think I’m going to start writing my reviews a little differently….)	Sorry, guys, this one just wasn’t for me. I can see why it’s adored by so many people, but I found it hard for me to join them. 	This book is a required read by so many schools. I’m actually supposed to read it next year, but me being the nerd that I am I decided to read it early, as part of my quest to read as many classic books as possible before I die. (Which, considering how many cups of coffee I drink, could be coming sooner than later.) I can’t tell you how many people stopped by me whilst I was reading this book and commented on how much they loved it (and in a freshman’s case, the movie), and the amount of guilt that I felt because I wasn’t on board.
Summary:
	If you asked me what this book was about before I read it, the most I could tell you was that it was about a guy named Gatsby. I was surprised to find that our narrator was actually a guy named Nick Carraway, who lived next door to Gatsby and retells his experiences with Mr. Gatsby’s parties, his beguiling charm, and his undying love for Daisy Buchanan, who happens to be Nick’s cousin. Seriously—that’s it. That’s what the blurb says it’s about. And indeed, it’s easy to see that Gatsby absolutely adores Daisy, but as much as they say so I never felt like I actually got to see them in love. Their affair is told briefly in flashbacks, but it never amounted to a love story. They were telling, not showing.	The entire book felt like that—there wasn’t enough of anything. This book is 180 pages long, and I feel like it’s missing at least a hundred more of them. It needed more depth, more of a backstory to everything that was happening. Fitzgerald had more fun describing how beautiful everything was and how alluring Daisy’s voice was than the progression of the story. (Seriously, he mentions it like ten times, three in the first sixty pages.) Every time he started to describe how intricate a woman was, I felt my eyes roll a little.	As for the characters, the only one that I liked was Gatsby himself, but that might be because I kept picturing him as Leonardo DiCaprio in a suit. (Come on—even if you’re not a fan, you have to admit that’s a delicious picture to behold.) But even Gatsby failed me, with his fascination of a girl that he couldn’t let go of. I understand that’s the point of the story, but his love for her grew to the brink of being scary.“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby quietly. “She’s never loved you. She loves me.”Wait—there’s more.“I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly. “You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.”	They claimed it was love, but I saw obsession. He was convinced that Daisy loved him, and only him. It might have read differently if there had been more romance. Every other character was pretty much an asshole, and our narrator was vague as fuck. 	The only thing that gave this book an extra star was its writing, which I can only describe as being lovely.His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.	Indeed, what little bits of actual romance that was in this book made my heart, which is actually very soft and enjoys things like kittens and sweater weather, literally swoon. But there wasn’t enough.	As well, the edition I read is the authorized text. Basically, the first edition contained a number of errors from the author’s extensive revisions and rushed production schedule, and reprintings departed further and further from Fitzgerald’s original words. This edition is the book as he intended it to be. Sadly, Fitzgerald’s original words needed some more punctuation, and the words, pretty though they were, sometimes felt like an illusion to distract me from the fact that nothing had happened so far.	It’s said that when Fitzgerald died, he feared that he was a failure and that everybody had forgotten about him. Judging by the fact that this book is acclaimed to be “the great American novel”, I highly doubt that that’s the case. Perhaps my hopes were just too high for this book. Perhaps I’m a bit too nit-picky. But I just wasn’t with the majority with this one."
"109",108,"Lucas","I'll start by saying I haven't yet watched Leonardo DiCaprio play Jay Gatsby, and continue by adding that I don't really want to. At least, not after reading this. As a ""classic,"" I expected more from The Great Gatsby than I received. Overall, I wasn't invested in the characters, which made me less than interested in the storyline. I disliked Daisy's vapid, gold-digging personality. I found Tom to be an unbearable clod. And despite all that I was deeply dissatisfied with, I have two things to commend: I rather liked Jordan's sporty, yet regal lifestyle, and I was semi-charmed by the main character. I'm afraid to say that that's the extent of the kind words I can offer for this particular piece. In the end, it was all I could do to get through it without falling fast asleep."

Jack (I think his name is Jack) goes to NY rents a house next to Gatsby mansion and his cousin Daisy lives across the pond with her husband Tom and her pro golf friend Jordan (female). Gatsby loves daisy and throw lavish parties in hopes that daisy will show up to one one day...They fell in love 5 years ago but since he was broke she couldn't or wouldn't be with him. Gatsby finds out ""jack"" is her cousin twice removed and asked him to have her over for tea so Gatsby can see her. They see each other... They start to hang out and party all the time, her husband Tom suspects Gatsby and Daisy have a thing going on calls them out on it. Daisy upset with Gatsby because he's a bootlegger, Daisy is in his car and driving ends up hitting and killing a woman but leaves the scene... It all gets pinned on Gatsby by Tom and the women's husband (who was hit and killed) kills Gatsby in revenge and also kills himself... Oh yeah jack had a fling with Jordan PS apparently his name is actually Rick and not Jack... That in it's self should tell how much I cared about this book"

"126",125,"Steph","Let me preface my review by saying that filmmakers are VERY good at making trailers. Sometimes. I keep seeing the trailers for the upcoming film version of ""Gatsby"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio (whom I really enjoyed in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and ""Catch Me If You Can"") and it looks exciting and flashy and I began thinking I would like to see it. My son expressed an interest, too. I suggested we read the book beforehand so we can get a feeling for what to expect. I'm glad I did. I did read this book some 20-plus years ago when I was in High School, but memory being what it is, I didn't remember much about it. So I went into reading it a mostly blank slate. Be aware there are spoilers in this review. I'm assuming you also had to read it for school. The book moves along quickly and is compelling enough, I suppose. It's told from the point of view of Nick Carraway, a neighbor-by chance- of the title character. I was struck early on in the story by how bland Carraway's character is. His storytelling is without passion, without emotion and flat.Which is kind of a problem. Because he is surrounded by the worst of 1920's elitist society, and he appears to be without feeling about it one way or another. He doesn't quite fit in with them, but neither does he feel repelled or bothered by their scandalous behavior. When Tom backhands his mistress and breaks her nose, Carraway describes the event in mild terms and without any reaction or feeling on his part. It's as if he's outside, looking in on the events. And not terribly bothered by any of it. He basically shrugs his shoulders and moves on.The story is depressing, for various reasons, and the characters have no redeeming qualities. Gatsby is childish, trying to live in a fantasy-land; unable to really see or handle reality. He has no real relationships, he creates himself as a caricature of what he imagines Daisy would like him to be, and ends up lonely and out of touch. He lives in a perpetual daydream. Alone, even when surrounded by others.Daisy is the epitome self-centered, bourgeois materialism, and even she doesn't know what she wants. Tom represents the worst of masculinity: he's abusive, abrasive, selfish and racist. There are a handful of other minor characters that don't really register as interesting or enticing.I did not enjoy this story. I was surprised by this-- why are so many students required to read this garbage? The 1920's weren't really like this, for the majority of common Americans. It does give a little insight into the world of the ultra-rich and corrupt at the time, I suppose. Maybe there's some value in that, but it's so dumb and the characters are so limited and bland and the story left me feeling depressed and annoyed. I don't think I've ever read anything else by Fitzgerald, but I don't see myself seeking him out again.Maybe my problem is that I'm spoiled on the modern character-driven, emotive writing, on books that make my heart pound and my mind race and that include characters I love or love to hate. Or maybe some books that are considered ""classics"" are really just crap. I also hated ""Great Expectations"" by Dickens. But there are others I love. ""The Scarlet Letter"", ""Little Women"", ""Macbeth""... and others. Hmm... I suppose that's a topic for another time.The best thing I can say about this book is that it's short. It only took me a couple of days to get through, and that's only because I can't just sit down and read. I would have had it done in half a day if I'd been able to. But what a waste of an afternoon that would have been. And, no. I won't be seeing the movie."

"135",134,"Marjo","The original rating remains. I want to like this book. I have tried to read it many times, I even tried the audio book because the people who like Gatsby like the ""musical quality of the writing"" and I thought I would be better able to appreciate it by listening than by reading.

"143",142,"Jesse Summer-lavigne","This book is extremely overpraised. People look at it because it screams the American Dream, perceptions, and a good heart to heart love story, its instantly genious.The subtle meanings in the book aren't subtle and the ideas in it always tread face value. The author is constantly trying to tell you what you believe whether you like it or not. He is trying to make the characters fit into certain archetypes while specifically trying to make them seem like individuals at the same time. Of course the overbearing of the archetypes win out and you are forced to hate Jordan for one reason and love Gatsby for another. Its such a biased reading. The love between Gatsby and Daisy is so shallow and pathetic, that you can't equate it to the American Dream, like Fitzgerald tries to do. Gatsby would be equated to a love-starved teenager who listens to too many breakup songs. Fitzgerald says that basic human actions is equal to the complexities of real day life.What makes the book worse is Nick, the main character, is supposed to look out and analyse the events happening, but he does such a terrible job of it. Fitzgerald wants to make him the tell all character of the book, but the narrator is placed in the events going on and although he says he can ""fade in and out"" when he wishes, you see that he gets stuck in the things going on in the book and can't control what is going on. If he wasn't so emotionally attached to the story, even holding Gatsby's funeral, he might have been better at giving insight on the story.The book itself doesn't give anything more than a basic story, with no real overarching idea that actually ties the book together. It is apparently supposed to be the American Dream and the futility of it, which is used and abused over a story idiots to make it mean nothing. This book is a waste of time to read."

"146",145,"Olivia Mainville","I decided to give this book another try. I had to read it for twelfth grade English class, and even though I couldn’t remember much of it, I can remember hating it for some reason. Upon re-reading the first two pages, I understood why. The narrator, a thirty-year-old man named Nick Carraway, who, by the way, hardly bothers to shed much information about himself, speaks like the voice-over for a 1940’s film noir. The writing style resembles a diary written after the events that it discusses, often flashing forward to reveal information Carraway received at a later point. His use of language is intellectual, occasionally didactic, and confusing in meaning at times. It’s also a tad racist, but that’s understandable, considering it’s an homage to the Roaring Twenties in New York. The plot twists surrounding the issues of infidelity, prohibition, and motor vehicle accidents are rather out-dated and dull now. The author makes the novel even more boring by intriguing readers with rumours about Gatsby and postponing his physical introduction, only to give his biography immediately afterwards. The lack of suspense left me in a constant state of anticlimax. There was even a scene where Carraway listed for two pages the guests he saw going to Gatsby’s parties! It would have been more interesting to see who these people really were, rather than say a simple sentence about them. Also, stories about rich people bore me to tears because they always seem to lack any character traits I can sympathize with, “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy – they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.” Why would I want to care about what troubles them?The only thing I liked about “The Great Gatsby” was Fitzgerald’s attention to body language. He also described things in odd ways that caught my eye, like when he says Gatsby’s “elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.” Also, it was interesting to see how people used the word “cool” like it was newly in style, which it could have been. Other than that, though, this book was not “cool,” and I still don’t understand why students have to read this. It went over my head in high school because of its language, its tedium, and the fact that it doesn’t address anything that relates to me! Let’s hope I never have to read this one a third time.See more of my reviews at www.oliviamainville.com"

"151",150,"Monica V","The novel The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a love story set in the summer of 1922 on Long Island. It’s about a young, mysterious, multi- millionaire named Jay Gatsby. He’s a self-made man who started out with no money; only a plan for achieving the American dream. Before he was rich and successful, he was training to be an officer and met the beautiful socialite Daisy who he fell in love with. Gatsby went overseas to fight in the war and Daisy had promised to wait for him until he got back but decided to marry the wealthy and powerful Tom Buchanan instead. When Gatsby returns he’s determined to make a fortune and achieve the social position necessary to win back Daisy. This story teaches you that money can’t buy happiness. Gatsby thought that all that money would make her fall in love with him but he ended up realizing that all she cared about was material things.My least favorite character was Daisy Buchanan. She’s in love with money and material luxury. She’s shallow and has no feelings whatsoever. She even treats her own baby like an object and shows her off to people like a trophy. When Daisy is introducing her daughter to her cousin Nick, she says, “I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool- that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’” (117). Daisy’s friend Jordan was telling Nick about how the night before her wedding Daisy received a letter from Gatsby which caused her to have second thoughts, but she still married him anyway. “She married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver.” (76). That shows how shallow she really is because even though she loved Gatsby all she really wanted was money. Also when she ran over Myrtle, she didn’t even stop the car and let Gatsby take the blame for it. Even when Gatsby was killed she didn’t bother going to the funeral and it showed how selfish she really is. 	I didn’t like this book at all and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. I thought it was very confusing, hard to follow, boring, and a waste of time. I think it’s a completely overrated book and I don’t understand why it’s a classic. The reason I decided to read this was because of the movie and I wanted to read it before it came out. I was disappointed when I finished it though and didn’t expect it to be as awful as it was. Also the writing style in the 1920’s was different so it was difficult to understand."

I really don't know what to make of it. Maybe I don't know how to read classics, yet. Or maybe it is because I didn't understood it properly as I don't have US background and failed to grasp what this whole Jazz age is.You are only provided vague informations about everyone. Gatsby. What does that guy do? He is a drug dealer. Oh! great, atleast tell that in a convincing way. I spent some time reading it, I should understand it to some extent, right? What was the moral of the story? No morals. This is just some looser giving some parties. There is no character there that you care for. You don't mind what happens to all those imbeciles because you don't feel connected to them in any way. The characters are not fleshed out vividly that you may start some liking them or start pitying ""unfortunate"" turn of events in their lives This is one reason why I don't like this work.The plot is not interesting, characters are not well developed or interesting, there is no particular philosophy to talk about. .Even in the most weary of texts, I usually find some interesting observations by the author, about the world in general. Fortunately, even in the case of this vexing work, I picked some interesting remarks.
1. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've has' [Chapter 1, pp1:]2. It is great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue, and moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don't see or care. 3. Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life4.Dishonesty in a women is a thing that you never blame deeply- I was casually sorry and then I forgot

The value this work gets is, I can only theorize in my anguish, because of the snob value attached to it and it tells about a period some people are particularly concerned with in the US history. Were it not set in the US, I highly doubt about its impact on the so called ""Top X books to read before you die"" lists. Hmmm.. This is my first review, I thinkThis book stole enough time from me and it doesn't deserve any more. Too bad it was of a book that I don't want to see before my eyes again.

"176",175,"Avrie","I suppose this book's radical and liberating views on fidelity and morality were destined to make it famous. The humanist, existential worldview upheld by all of the characters made short work of killing some of them, and ruining the others. And the wanton sinfulness! There is nothing upstanding about the title character; hardly anything worth praising the narrator for, either; making it difficult to care for them. There was really no foothold for the reader to stand on and continue the story, except the crushed hope that something good might happen for once.The saddest part of the whole story was the utter despair that shrouded everything. Every spark of hope was blotted out by the dark outlook of its leading roles. Certainly, if you're looking for a happy ending, you won't find it here.One thing that I liked, however, was Fitzgerald's prose. He wrote beautiful description and made scenes come to life with a lilting cadence. If only there had been more than one emotion produced by the story.The book has done a good job of portraying an aspect of the Roaring 20s--that is, rebelling against former religious and moral standards, and the general breakdown society began experiencing at that time."

I had trouble dissecting the different underlying symbolism and breaking apart all of the different things that were going on. The Great Gatsby is one of those books that you almost need to read twice to fully understand everything. I think it was helpful that we read it in school so we could slowly go over each part of it.Even so, I really didn't enjoy reading it. The relationship between me, the reader, and the text just couldn't do it for me. The only engagement that was there was the fact that I had to know what was going on for class. There also wasn't a lot of relevance for me either. I couldn't connect with any of the characters or any of the conflicts they were having internally and externally. Relationships and relevance are two very important parts of reading, therefore I didn't find myself enjoying it.I did enjoy the movie, though. (Mostly because of Leonardo DiCaprio)"

"184",183,"Meghan Kavanaugh","The Great Gatsby is often heralded as The Great American Novel. However, as you can tell, I disagree. I found the novel almost slow to read through, even though it is a rather short book. The pacing felt odd, and all over the place, and I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters or their struggles. I felt no intrigue to who Jay Gatsby was, and the novel gave me no reason to. I felt no pity for him and his ""tragic"" love for Daisy, who owed him nothing. I understand that the novel could be taken as a criticism for the jazz age, but the characters just felt so flat, that it seemed like a high school play. I think, in general, the biggest problem with this novel is that I just wasn't given any reason to care about the characters, their problems, any criticisms of the Jazz Age, or anything, really. Not to mention most of Fitzgerald's work is plagiarized from his wife's work, and in this case, it would probably explain the wishy-washyness of the whole book. Overall, would not recommend.

"200",199,"Holly","Re-reading it since I read it in High School before I really appreciated novels."
"201",200,"Theo","Horrifically boring. Had to read it for a class assignment and disliked every moment of it.This book is dry.Date est*"
"202",201,"Elizabeth Boyd","I know I read this book before. However, upon re-reading it, I didn't remember anything. I had things underlined, but apparently didn't get too much out of the novel the first time. Although I think the novel F. Scott Fitzgerald has a great aptitude for writing, I can't say that I actually gleaned anything more than some quotable quotes from this second read."
"203",202,"David Uerkvitz","This is book full of symbolism which can be endlessly analyzed for its metaphoric plays on colours, characters, street signs, lights, clothing, repeated phrases and just about everything imaginable. This in itself usually adds to the quality of a book but in this case it becomes a burdensome and mediocre task in trying to unravel the meanings in this book. It comes down to the fact that in my opinion the symbolism that tbe book is based on is plain boring, I do not care about green lights, or white dresses, or street signs that are on the side of the road. I wish that these metaphors that are supposed to point the way to the deepness of human character could be based more off of things of substance just as interesting as the substance of human character. Maybe its the metaphors but I also found every character boring and uninteresting as well. I could not put down the book and say to myself that ""so and so was truly a great man/woman"", and so I leave the book uninspired and none the better in my own character. "
"204",203,"Brendan","This book... where to begin?I was incredibly bored by it. So many people hail it as wonderful--but I... no. I found it stupefyingly dull and uninspired. I even re-read it, just to make sure that I hadn't missed something important during my high school viewing.This book is at best an empty libation to the gods of High School English."
"205",204,"Ash","What was that!!"
"207",206,"Lynn","I really was expecting more from this book. I found it to be a big disappointment. "

"209",208,"Lyne","I'm sorry, I know this is a classic however, I just could not get into it. I found it very confusing so sorry, not wasting my time reading it."
"211",210,"Mead","I couldn't finish it I'd rather watch the movie "
"212",211,"Conrad","This is most likely the worst book I've ever read. Fitzgerald spends most of his pages describing the characters and their actions. Although much time is spent on this, no connection is forged between the reader and any of the characters. He seems to have forgotten how to include a plot. Basically, this book is a string of completely unrelated events with no closure."
"213",212,"Andybeckman","This fucking book blew. What a pompous fucking jew"
"214",213,"Kari","**< 1 Star**I don't think I have ever hated a book as much as I hated this one. My opinions are just that... my opinions. They have nothing to do with the literary merit of the book - which I agree it does have. There are so many symbols, themes, and passages to pick apart that I can see why it is a popular book for critiques. However, the arrogance, selfishness, and just utter lack of regard for anyone but ones-self in this book is appalling. For example: Tom is mad at Daisy for cheating on him. He is not the ""type of guy"" who will let someone else take advantage of his wife. Yet, Tom has been cheating for years. He even cheated on their honeymoon. And the person he is currently with (was) was a married woman. So, it is ok for Tom to cheat, but not for Daisy to. Oh, and it is ok for his girl to cheat on her husband because he is ""poor and ignorant"" but Tom is too rich and smart for that. Gatsby's character is written poorly when looking at reader-character connection. However, there is a lot of symbolism in his character - he throw lavish parties weekly, yet dies alone. His love for Daisy overshadows everything he does, and honestly, his character just isn't believable. And Nick... the narrator. He just seems to accept everything the way it is and just moves on from it. He is perfectly fine with all the cheating going on. He knows that Jordan is a pathological liar, and likes that about her. So, bottom line - I HATED this book. I understand it literary credibility and why it is taught in schools, as there is so many different techniques used in the writing - but it was horrible. "
"215",214,"Lydia Atkins","All the hype surrounding this novel and I just didn't like it!Sure the description is intricate and detailed but what actually happened? I'd struggle to tell you. The overarching problem is that Fitzgerald tends to allude to things taking place rather than explicitly stating they've occurred. I often found myself reading whole pages, or even whole chapters again trying to figure out the actual series of events that take place. No spoilers here of course but there were things referred to later in the novel as if common knowledge that I had no idea about! Had I not seen the film a couple of years ago, I'm sure I would be completely clueless.Once you have deciphered the basic physical happenings of this story, you then have the awkwardness of transitioning into the next plot point. Fitzgerald's style is so disjointed that it's hard to imagine that the characters at the end of any given scene were in fact present when it began. Characters often flicker between intense emotions in the blink of an eye and change their entire opinions and viewpoints within less than a page and for no apparent reason. It's like you've suddenly jumped ahead a chapter and found that everything's changed!A prime example of this is the main character and narrator Nick Carraway who frequently both despises and adores Gatsby in the same sentence. His opinions of all other characters seem to change with the wind. One character in particular (again, no spoilers) he seems to get on extremely well with right until the last chapter when suddenly he can't stand the sight of him or ""bare to shake his hand"" and of course, half a page later he does exactly that.Having enjoyed the film sometime ago I was bitterly disappointed with its original material! It's perfect for a Hollywood blockbuster once you've worked out the story line and salvaged the characterisation from its schizophrenic whirlpool but overall, a very annoying and confusing read."
"216",215,"Donnolee Ho-shing","The Great Gatsby was just another ordinary read for me, some might say: so-so."
"217",216,"Inglan","One of the required reading books assigned in high school. Definitely not a favorite. I understand Fitzgerald is a favorite, but he's never been one of mine. Certainly one of those assignments I muddled through half-heartedly."
"219",218,"Jorge Alva","I read this book twice, Spanish and English. Never really understood what's so 'Great' about Gatsby, can someone please explain? I found it boring, dull and pretencious. "

"223",222,"Alex Pakula","I don't remember anything about this book except that I was forced to read it two different years for English class and I totally hated it."

"227",226,"Tina Starr","What is up with people who cheat on each other and then turn to killing/murder for confort? Books like these no matter how great society deems them as fantastic are upseting!"
"228",227,"Black&white","I found the writing neither to my preference nor particularly good. The story far from interesting, the descriptions appalling at times, the party scenes drab & hollow and the main character seemed to be suffering more of mental issues as opposed to being a romantic, the two are related I suppose. Suck obsessions are far from healthy, the ending is okay. Overall I would deem this to be far below sub par at best but many hail this one as a romantic classic and a masterpiece for all sorts of reasons. I wouldn’t have given it even a second thought without the reputation, I didn’t care at all for it."
"229",228,"Lauren Beck","There have been few times that I have literally celebrated when I have finished reading a book. This was one of those times."
"230",229,"Tinamarie","Never read anything that with so many boring and unsympathetic characters"
"231",230,"Mika Harjula","Mediocre as best. Very blend and highly overrated. It owns the movie adaption a lot for its buildup among readers. "
"232",231,"Magdalene","I tried...really I tried to find some shred of this book enjoyable. I recalled reading this many years ago in high school. A lover of books from a young age, you would most likely find me riffling through the library stacks seeking out the next great story or adventure. The trailers promoting Leonardo DiCaprio, Carey Mulligan and Tobey Maguire in the May release of the latest film adaptation of the American classic, inspired me to give it a second read. Try as I might, I just couldn't remember the heart of the story other than the obvious love interest and mystery behind Gatsby himself. I totally understand that many find this story to be a brilliant tale, but I cannot share this opinion. I find nothing romantic in this twisted love story. The characters all seem to share disdain for each other and yet they willingly seek out each other company. There seems to be no respect for friendship, marriage or true relationships. The prose is frenetic, like a poorly written, long winded diary of bad behaviors. Sure my words may not please others who adore this book, and that is okay. I'm glad other can find enjoyment in this story. Now, I’m off in search of new book. "

"236",235,"Corri","I read this in about 9th grade...I know it's a ""classic"", but I didn't love it."
"237",236,"Levi Blomkvist","This book is for readers that like to think, and read between the lines. I am not that kind of person so I did not like it. It was too slow, and had no adrenaline and that type, so if you are like me that like adrenaline, a good joke and some crazy stuff, do NOT read this book. The book story is going on in New York, where Nick (one of the main characters and the story teller) talks about his experience through his time in NY with Gatsby, Daisy and Tom as the main characters."
"238",237,"Sarah Ruiz","This book is actually interesting how so many different events take place in this book. Also how each event connects to a period in history, this book also has a life lesson that we can all learn from. Which is love can sometimes be blinding and it can lead to death."
"239",238,"AJ Mina","I really had high expectations for this book. I know that this is one of the great classics. I don't know why but I did not enjoy the book. The style of writing is sort of new to me and I was struggling to understand what was happening. I think that maybe now is not the right time to read this book since I'm stressed, tired and always busy. I'll read this again in a better timing. But as of now, giving this one star."
"240",239,"Jec Mendiola","The story is interesting still I can't finish reading this, definitely not my cup of tea. The hype brings me big expectation but boy, this is overrated."

"243",242,"Sydney","Just didn't like... I wish I did because it's a classic and everyone else I know likes it, but I just don't. The characters were all selfish and I didn't like it. Maybe it's because that's how a lot of people are today, I don't know..."
"245",244,"Elaine Cristina Oliveira","I think I had expected so much more from it that I'm disappointed... I can't really understand all the fuss about it... but, of course, I'm not American... so..."
"247",246,"S.A. Thorup","I read this book for an English theory class, and I must say that though it is memorable in its own right (characters I could not like, among the reasons), it's not the memorable I like. I probably would have never read this book unless I took that class, and I don't see why it's such a...classic."
"249",248,"Summer Bishop","Maybe I'm missing something here, but I found this book abysmal. It seems many books I've read lately lack character development. Fitzgerald does the opposite: he over-develops his characters, to the point of redundant boredom. I wouldn't be surprised if Fitzgerald had spent 20 pages describing a brick wall. Bottom line: too much focus on developing the characters and not enough plot."
"251",250,"Ridhika","This book is in the lists of ""100 books to read before you die"". Well, I must say that it was rather difficult to survive through the book inspite of it being short. The charaters are shallow and confused. Nobody seemed to know what they are doing and where they are.I did not enjoy the writting style of Fitzgerald. He shifted from one scene to another without any introduction or an end to another. It was difficult to understand the setting in which the characters were speaking to each other. It's as if Fitzgerald got bored while describing one scene and abruptly jumped to the next. Well, this is one of the worst books I have ever read and I fail to understand why and what people like this crap for? "
"253",252,"anarki","Bored me to tears. "
"254",253,"Trey","Read in high school. Hated it. Case for the fact I don't like 'real' books. One of many romantic books my high school forced on us. They liked to push the books that appealed to girls."
"255",254,"Lindsey","I may sound terribly unsophisticated, but I just can't read older novels. The vocabulary and style are just too different from what I'm used to."
"256",255,"Jessica Flora"," The only thing I have to say about this book, is boring! It gets interesting only at the end and it is the death of the main character. All the rest is just random junk that shouldn't be in it. The only reason that I read this book was because it was a school grade. Now that I have finished it, I don't want to think of it anymore. To bad I have to take a test on it. Problem is that I will have to re-read it just so that I remember everything. To be honest I would rather get an F on the test than to read that boring junk again.  All in all, it is the most boring book I have ever read and I would only recommend this book to anyone that likes boring love stories that end up in crumbling to pieces, or just want to waste their time. I coudn't care less about this book."
"257",256,"Brittany Jerlinga","Why do people love this book so much? Were we all just duped because it is a classic? No one is likeable. I couldn't care about any of they characters. Decadence and stupidity. There didn't seem to be any real chemistry between characters (why was he drawn to her in the first place?)... And the scene with the shirts? White people problems at their finest. Boring. "
"258",257,"Dalton Oligschlaeger","I had high hopes when I picked up this book to read, I had heard nothing but good things about it and was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately, I was dissapointed. Don't get me wrong, the story idea was beautiful. Nick meets the mysterious Gatsby, who no one really knows much about. He falls for Jordan Baker, as Gatsby develops a relationship with Daisy, and their romances add a lot to the book. The story is interlaced with tragedy as huge characters begin to die, all while trying to figure out who the secretive, yet social, Great Gatsby. As Nick begins to talk and visit with him more and more, he learns that Gatsby isn't at all who everyone assumes that he is. However, people don't like everything they hear.As I said, the story and the concept are great, but I found it to be very boringly written. There was never a point in the story that really stood out for me, no hook that drew my interest. While, at times, I was curious to see what happened next, it was hard for me to read long enough to figure it out. I feel bad talking negatively about a huge classic, but this one just didn't cut it for me. It feels good to say that I've read it, but at the same time, I wouldn't have lost sleep if I never did. It was a great attempt, and a great idea, but in my eyes it completely fell flat."
"259",258,"Valerie Olesh","I had to force myself to finish reading this short novel in time for my book club. It took me 6 weeks. It was a snoozeer about a bunch of losers. Terribly disappointed, since it's considered a classic. There was not a redeeming character and no real justice. "
"262",261,"Karen","hated this book. It's one of those ""a charmed life, isnt so charmed"" book where rich people do messed up things to each other. it bored me."
"263",262,"Elliet","I had to read this for English class in high school. It is the most boring book I've ever tried to read. If you don't like the classics, I wouldn't recommend reading this one."
"264",263,"Dawn","Hmmm. Not at all what I expected. As I am on a quest to read many of the classics I am unable to really identify what makes this a classic. I have a steadfast rule to always read the book before watching the movie... But now I don't even care to see the movie. Not engaging, did not care about the characters, did not inspire any desire for discussion. Just blah"
"266",265,"Janet Kincaid","I think I'm the only person in America who didn't like this book and failed to appreciate its content and literary genius. Frankly, I thought it was a vapid, poorly written tome. My expectations were quite high and I was disappointed. I know I'm in the minority on this book. Normally, I'd tell you not to bother, but given its classification as a ""classic in American literature"", I'll leave it to you to decide."
"268",267,"Kerry","When I read this book in High School, I loved it. Then my roommate last year was harping on me for liking it. So, I decided to re-read it... and I HATED it. Oh man! How could I ever think it was good or decent. It was so boring and snobby. I thought I liked Gatsby as a character, but really, he's just this pathetic man who has no balls. And Nick Carraway, the narrator, was even worse. What a spinless prick.ughh. I hate this book."
"270",269,"Wendy Cleary","I haven't read it but can't get rid of the rating"
"273",272,"Erika S","If I never read this book again, I'll be only too happy. I've done too many theoretical approaches to ever again read it with the same poignancy and appreciation that I used to. It's racist, sexist, Marxist, and a few other -ists. And Nick Carraway is an untrustworthy prick."
"274",273,"CM","I guess it was okay. I honestly don't have much more to say about it. I had to read it for a collage literature class, and I think there are plenty other books of great literature out there that are more uplifting and important then this one."
"275",274,"Negar","I felt no connection with any of the characters and, worse, actually hated them all. The detached narration didn't help any. I guess it's good for illustrating a specific life of specific people in a specific time, but otherwise I got nothing out of it. If you want to learn about the American Dream, read A Raisin In The Sun, not this yawn-fest."
"276",275,"Duncan Ralston","Look, I don't hate a lot of the classics, but this is one I absolutely despise. The writing style is so flowery, they could stock it at FTD. It's all metaphor and very little substance. Hate the characters, hate the narrator. Daisy is a vapid, insipid little twerp, and Gatsby is clueless and pathetic, a celebrity hanger-on and an (alleged) bootlegger, whose thuggery (to make it even more boring) is not interesting enough for Fitzgerald to explore, instead happening outside the narrative of this novella. They're Pip and Estella without a plot to carry them.And can anybody tell me what in the hell is with the eyes of God? As a metaphor, it makes absolutely no sense. Who are they watching? WHY are they watching?I know I'm going to catch some flack for this one, and probably for my review of Catcher in the Rye--but for me, this is up there with the anti-feminist classic Breakfast at Tiffany's. Just ugh."

"278",277,"Kathryn Renée","I just don't get it. I can't stand this book. I don't like the people in it, I don't like the plot, I really can't think of anything I like about it at all. What am I missing?"

"280",279,"Campbell","I read (okay, was forced to read) this at school and as a consequence - as with all school-enforced texts - hated it. My memories of it are somewhat dim, however, so I can see I am going to have to go back and re-read this. "
"281",280,"Hunter Morris","i found this book a little hard to get into. right from the start it jumps you straight into the middle of this setting and its very scarcely described. you are imediatly introduced to an aray of new charecters, and it is hard to understand who is doing what and what did that someone say. then further throughout this book it describes the settings in a wierd way the actions of others are hard to follow as the description becomes scarce and the dialouge jumps back an forth. to me it was a very strange book and i had a hard time enjoying it. now with that bieng said there are parts of the book that were spectacular. like i said they had a great description of the surrounding settings that our charecters are put in. an when bieng introduced to a new charecter there is a great description about them if not there actions. this book i personaly dont recomend but you are told to read it in class anyways, so i will give it an o.k."

"292",291,"Kimberlee","My thoughts on this book: What the heck just happened?"
"293",292,"Jeter_david","I was forced to read this book this year in English, and I absolutely hated it. Fitzgerald has a nice writing style, and were he to write something exciting I would really enjoy it, but this book, however, is NOT exciting. Reading this book is comparable to watching five straight hours of Saturday morning cartoons: after a while your brain cells turn to jelly and try to ooze out of your ear. It's weird how bored I get when reading this book, I can usually tolerate semi-boring books like this, but this book DEFINITELY goes against my literary grain.Anyway, after telling you how much I hate this book, I guess I should tell you why I put it on My Books.It forces me to question my motives, as far as careers are concerned. Is the object of the game to make as much money as I can?, Will people automatically love me if I manage to get lots of money?, and, Will they still love me after the money (even myself) is gone?If you read this again (I'm assuming most of you read this in eleventh grade like I did) pay attention to the relationships that Gatsby makes (actually, FORGETS to make) in the process of achieving his goals."
"294",293,"Alexandra Popovic","Why is this famous? I hate reading boring books and this one definitely added itself to those ranks. All the characters are so annoying and the plot progresses in such a way that you feel like it doesn't deserve your attention. I read it in anticipation for the film - too bad that didn't make the pain worthwhile."
"296",295,"Gabriel","Wow...one of the slowest reads I have ever attempted! Fitzgerald is a master at making nothing out of something. One of my brother's favorite books - he can keep it!"
"297",296,"Rebekah Ortiz","I didn't really like this book because it had more of an informative tone which made it boring. Also this book skips topics and places really fast and I couldn't understand what Fitzgerald was saying most of the time so it was confusing. Some things that I did like about this book was Gatsbys idea that even though he was poor he could become anything he wanted and the lie that Gatsby was living made this book somewhat interesting."
"298",297,"Kimberley","I had no intention of reading this at first, because I don't enjoy classics, but it was an ebook for only 99c. Plus it has so many 5 star reviews. I read a little over half and was so bored I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. I wanted to persevere so badly because it's quite a short read, but no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't finish this book, especially since there are so many others I'd rather be reading. I guess Classics are just not my thing. I do want to see the movie though.NOTE: I have since watched the movie, and really enjoyed it. Seeing it visually, made me appreciate the story more. Beautiful cinematography."
"300",299,"Chris Hayman","Ugh. If that's quality American literature, I'll take chick lit. I didn't find anything of value in the plot or characters. "
"301",300,"Matt Jones","Awful. Not a single redeemable feature or likable character; not a shred of realistic dialogue; not a sentence throughout the book that didn't ooze with pretentiousness. Still, at least it was short."
"303",302,"Naomi","This book was a bad case of too much hype, the promises of an amazing, influential classic, and a lot of spoilers. Therefore, I found the book quite boring to be honest. The characters and places sort of blended together and it had a very forgettable plot. I don't know. Not my cup of tea. "
"304",303,"Kimberly Lee","I did not like this book at all. When I read this in my English class, it was really boring and I didn't seem to have any interest in this book whatsoever. This book is about a guy who throws a lot of parties but is very secretive abuot his life."

"308",307,"Arlett","I did not like this book. I could not relate to any of the characters. They all seemed like spoiled, self-centered, rich people, although some were richer than others. I'm gald I read it only because I'd always heard about it and now I know what its about. I think it is overated. I do not get all of the hype. "

This really wasn't worth the time. It was ""literary"" and that should have been warning enough for me."
"317",316,"Bradley Dyson","Too conservative for my liking"
"318",317,"Adrianne","Hated it. I don't know how some of these books make it so big. This book is about a guy who wanted to be like a really cool guy in high society Long Island New York and it turns out that the cool guy isn't so great after all. "

"322",321,"Ronnie Mclarty","Didn't get it at all."
"324",323,"Claudia"," On the word of Ernest Hemingway I read The Great Gatsby and started to read Tender Is the Night. In A Moveable Feast, Hemingway's memoir of his time in Paris during the early 1920's, he describes Fitzgerald as having written a great novel referring to Gatsby. So I read it. Hemingway touts the ""mot juste -- the one and only correct word to use."" He says he learned ""to distrust adjectives"" as he would later ""learn to distrust certain people in certain situations."" As frustrated as I get with Hemingway's lusterless and often unnecessary dialog attributions, I do like his clean, strong prose. He did use adjectives. Adjectives that infused his prose with life and passion. He wrote of what he called ""false spring."" After the trees had leafed out and he would feel joy at Spring's arrival then would sometimes come a return of winter. ""When the cold rains kept on and killed the spring, it was as though a young person had died for no reason."" Simple, strong adjectives. Then came Gatsby.  Her front lawn seems the most active thing about Daisy. ""The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens -- finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of it run."" And there's Daisy and Jordan Baker. ""We ought to plan something,"" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed. ""All right,"" said Daisy. ""What'll we plan?"" She turned to me helplessly: ""What do people plan?"" If it is ennui which I miss, I can stream an emo music performance on You Tube. My attitude about both emo music and bored rich folk is the same. If they're bored with themselves, why would I be interested? But surely I must be missing something in Gatsby so I read on.  Then came this gem from Daisy's husband.  ""Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored Empres' by this man Goddard?""  ""Why, no,"" I answered, rather surprised by his tone. (This from our narrator.) ""The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be -- will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved."" ""Tom's getting very profound,"" said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. ""He reads deep books with long words in them."" Throw in a little anti-Semitism and disparage the lower classes with whom it is all right to screw around. Bring in Gatsby, whose wealth is on a par with (or greater than) Daisy's crowd, but its source is unknown and his antecedents are even murkier. And you have a thoroughly disagreeable book. The plot is slow to develop. When it did, I immediately thought of Thomas Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities, which describes an equally amoral money-centric life-style. But does it better. I went back to Hemingway's A Moveable Feast and reread what he said about Fitzgerald. He said Fitzgerald produced better work after his wife's first mental break down. So I was back on the hunt. I found Tender Is the Night. I got to page 8. ""The woman who had recognized her was not a Jewess, despite her name."" It didn't seem to matter how many more pages I read. Same song, second verse. Could get better... but I gave up trying to find where exactly the 'better' began. So, if you're tempted to read Fitzgerald, I would humbly recommend that you read Thomas Wolfe instead. And disregarding what I can only describe as his overly generous praise for Fitzgerald's work, I can recommend Hemingway's A Moveable Feast. Now I shall have to check out some of the other writers he talks about in that little book. Surely I cannot be so disappointed in them."

"326",325,"Brenda","hated it....read in high school--shallow, self-absorbed rich people with too much money and too much time on their hands....much like reality tv today"
"327",326,"Michele","I had to call my mom the English teacher when I finished this to find out what the big deal was, because for me it was a giant ""Meh."" Apparently when Fitzgerald wrote this, novels of the glitterati were a brand new thing (Jackie Collins had not yet been invented). All I can say is, it left me markedly unimpressed. The characters were unlikable, the plot dull, and the pace glacial. Apply context and literary theory and you might get something; me, I like a story you can enjoy on its own merits."
"328",327,"Jaylee","This book is set in the Roaring Twenties and it basically portrays the moral disintegration of society at that time. It is a story of a love octagon where almost everybody is married, yet they are in love with someone else. They chase after their fleeting fancies with no sense of any responsibility. In my opinion, this book would be a tragedy even if people hadn't died in the end. Throughout the whole book I felt like screaming at the main characters (Daisy and Gatsby in particular) to stop being so selfish and immature. They were totally irresponsible and had no idea what real love actually means. Not that I presume to know completely what ""real love"" means at this point in my life, but I do know that it isn't what they were experiencing!"

"334",333,"Kristin Baxter","I didn't like this book at all. Sorry, Mr. Fitzgerald. If it's any consolation, I wanted desperately to like it and I felt a smidge guilty that I didn't. I tried. I couldn't quite relate to the characters, though. They were all weird. Was Daisy trying to be funny? Cute? Half the crap she said didn't make a lick of sense. And Gatsby...what the heck?! He couldn't move on from a past love so he got tons of money (illegally) thinking that would win her back? And he wrapped his self worth up in his material things, constantly needing assurance from others that his house was magnificent, his car was magnificent, his ""schooling"" was magnificent, his parties were magnificent, and on and on. I wasn't a fan of the writing style, either. The thoughts of Nick, the storyteller, just seemed to meander on and get a little off track. Some of his ramblings just didn't seem to relate to what was going on in the story. Or...maybe it's just that I have no clue what I'm talking about! I'm sure this is an excellent piece of literature and I have no appreciation for quality work. ;-)"

Deep, intricate people in whom I feel I am vicariously living enthrall me. These characters we're blase' to the max. Sure, there is a hidden theme throughout the book showing the folly of living for pleasure and acceptance, but I'm pretty sure they beat that horse dead by the end- which I WOULD say came far too quickly being I enjoy a good, long read- but not so much in this case.

I really hope the movie is better than the book was."
"346",345,"Faith Quick","i hate this book. there is no other way for me to say it. it is filled with hateful masochistic people who i don't like nor do i care what happens to. . i just can not get into a book where there is not one character i like or admire even a little. i have found through the years since i read this book in junior high that if i don't care about the main character in the book i don't end up liking the book. it could be the best writing ever written and i still wont like the book. the character doesn't even have to be the good guy. i just need to care what happens to them. for me that was the great gatsby. i don't care if he gets the girl because he turns into the very people he claims to hate. he is just as bad as the rich snobs that have shunned him from their pathetic little group. the girl is so empty, self centered, she is dull, boring, and utterly predictable. she holds no moral character, she is bare of any real emotion or original thought. this book almost ruined me for classics. luckily i kept reading other classic books like twain, steinbeck, and dumas. i wish i could like this book because so many people have come to love and admire it but i can not. i have tried many times in various stages of my life and the one constant factor is i hate the great gatsby."

"360",359,"Valentine","I disliked this book intensely. I was forced to read t for my grade 12 English class. Now, usually I love the books we do in English (Shakespeare, To Kill a Mockingbird, Of Mice and Men etc) but I truly despised this book. Considering it is a classic lauded for its symbolism and meaning, I found it quite shallow. I hated or disliked every character with the exception of Nick. However Nick was not really a distinct character, merely a narrator the reader projects onto. The plot was nothing special, the characters were unlikable and lacked depth, the morals and themes of the story were forced.I am an avid reader and have read and loved plenty of classics, but I don't know why this book deserves such a title...how much effort does it take to write a book where the symbolism is so obvious and unsophisticated? We get it...colors are important. This book also committed the ultimate sin...it was boring! Nothing happened for the first half of the book and then a ludicrous ending occurred. By the end I was left staring blankly at the page thinking...that's it? Keep in mind that this is a fairly short book. Most books I read tell me plainly that I could never be an author (or at least not easily). I can think of compelling stories easily enough, but don't know how to translate it into a compelling book. However, after reading this, I began to think that the trick to receiving critical acclaim is to make your book dense, obscure and full of flowery imagery and symbolism."

"374",373,"Ann-Marie","I'm likely going to offend literature aficionados with this review, so I'll start with the upfront admission that I don't have a great deal of knowledge regarding the historical context of this book. Consequently, there could be a great deal of subtext I'm not picking up on. Nevertheless...The Great Gatsby's one of those books that you've either been required to read while at school (I wasn't) or is touted as one of the great fictional works that everyone really needs to read. So I read it.I found the characters frequently tedious and acting in patently ludicrous ways, so I struggled to regard them as especially believable. And if I don't find them believable, then I don't have a great deal of empathy for their situation. The fact that almost all of them got themselves into their own wretched mess made them even less pardonable. It was like teenage angst, but for people in their 30s and 40s who refuse to act with much logic or consideration. Everything's just a theatrical opportunity for histrionics and for them to dig themselves into even greater midlife crises.The narrator, Nick Carraway is probably the least irritating, but even he acted erratically in places in such a way that it just felt like it was to further the story rather than act in any congruent fashion.The story's a bit of a closed-loop universe in that there were a collection of convenient coincidences that tied the cast together. If the characters had been more enjoyable to read about, I wouldn't have minded this neat package approach, but it just left me feeling it was a pat ending and disgruntled that everyone was so mind-bendingly childish.Greater minds than I could probably tell you why this book is deemed ""one of the greatest works of American literature"", but I thought it was flat and unsatisfying."

"416",415,"Betelgeuse","Recensione pubblicata su Cronache di BetelgeuseIl libro presenta, a mio parere, alcuni grandi difetti: # il protagonista, nonché narratore della vicenda, tende a estraniarsi dagli avvenimenti che lo circondano, impartendo giudizi su tutto e tutti. Purtroppo però è facilmente influenzabile, lasciandosi trasportare da simpatie momentanee, che distruggono così il suo ruolo di giudice supremo che vorrebbe invece assumere. # le descrizioni sono troppo pesanti, colme di particolari che appesantiscono le scene e allentano il coinvolgimento emotivo che il lettore dovrebbe sviluppare verso i vari personaggi. Se l’obiettivo era descrivere al meglio la società frivola e festaiola, i triangoli amorosi e i cambiamenti della società di quegli anni, anche gli ambienti che circondano i vari personaggi avrebbero dovuto essere presentati nello stesso modo. Invece il contrasto creato genera solo punti morti nella lettura. # le donne assumono due ruoli principali, come esseri facilmente influenzabili dal primo uomo facoltoso o come attaccate al denaro o alla fama. Nessuno dei personaggi femminili spicca per qualche qualità particolare, ma tendono a confondersi in un insieme uniforme senza alcuna distinzione.Nel complesso però la scrittura è fluida nei dialoghi e nelle riflessioni interiori del protagonista, unico punto di forza del romanzo."

"431",430,"June Junebug","Because I was assigned this book my junior year of high school, I don't remember much from it. I only remember it being a very dramatic commentary on high society and about privileged white people complaining about nothing. I also remember Nick, whom I was told was supposed to be a ""common person"", but I couldn't associate myself with him either. Which was why I couldn't enjoy it because a)  I could not relate, b) I don't like reading about nihilistic, privileged, upper middle class people who don't do anything to mend their discontent with life, preventing the story from moving along, and c) I don't like reading about people sitting around pulling random prose out of their asses. I don't mind reading about wealthy people but these people threw away their riches and asked for more which is something I don't give a rat's ass about. What did that say to me at age sixteen? All rich, white people throw away their money and crave more fame and more of the glamorous things in life. It made me wonder why we weren't reading about rich, white people who did good in the world and why the high school never assigned any books with minorities in them. Another problem I had with it is that I don't remember anything about the women in the book except the fact that a woman named Daisy ran over somebody. Women being portrayed negatively and/or without solid personalities reads to me as not caring about female presence. However, because this was a few years ago, I am willing to give it another chance to amaze me and see if my opinion will change. To be continued..."

If I hadn't, I would have hated it less.The inevitable argument when someone doesn't like a ""classic"" is that he/she is ""a child"", ""narrow-minded"", or, my favorite, ""too immature to understand art."" Sorry. If you think any (or all) of these things, you probably like this book. That doesn't mean you're more mature than I am, though, or more open-minded, so please don't try that on me. It won't work.I mean, this is like the Robinson Crusoe of the twenties - dull, understuffed, intensely obnoxious characters and a protagonist who does next to nothing. (OK, Crusoe himself doesn't exactly do nothing. He has no emotions, though.)The CharactersNick Carraway: The protagonist who does next to nothing. No distinguishing characteristics, quirks, or even feelings.Gatsby Himself: Why is he great? Why is he so awesome? Beats the heck out of me. He's a rich guy who's in love with a witch. He has weird people skills. Oh, and he gives good parties.Daisy: Rich. And a nasty person. And really, who cares about her, because she's incredibly annoying.The Other Ones: Pretty sordid, the lot of them.I heard someone say that this book has ""the essence of true love."" Ah. Um. Jane Austen is true love. The Princess Bride is true love. Finding someone and spending the rest of your life with him/her is true love. (view spoiler)[Marrying someone else is definitely NOT true love, and RUNNING OVER A WOMAN and then speeding off in your car because you are too drunk/stupid/Daisy to notice/care is NOT true love. If it actually is, well then, we're all screwed. (hide spoiler)]Another common device of Gatsby-loving people is the defense that this is ""the great American novel."" Ah. Um. No. A great American novel is To Kill a Mockingbird, which is actually about Americans, not a tiny segment of the population (I'm talking about the sickeningly rich wackos who go to Gatsby's parties, and about whom the entire book is). Gatsby is the ""self-made man"", which, I'll grant, is a part of the ""American dream"", but I think another, and greater, part of the A. D. is to be happy once you've made yourself. Maybe...oh, I don't know, end up with the girl you love? A great novel is a book you can live by, and if anyone tried to live by this one, I really, really don't hold out much hope for them.The Bottom Line: Why this is called a ""classic"", and read in schools, and made a fuss over, I don't know. But basically, it is full of lies, shallowness, and characters with the depth of a sheet of paper, and so I am done with it. I'm glad I read it. I just don't ever want to read it again."
"448",447,"Rosita","The title unfortunately conjures up images of Takuya Kimura prancing frivolously in the Gatsby ads. I plunged into this book without reading the synopsis, and til halfway into it, I still had no idea where the story was heading. Perhaps that was why I didn't feel terribly engaged to the book. A successful and popular guy, Gatsby's devotion to Daisy was touching. Until something happens to him (which was quite late into the story), then it suddenly fell into place. Here was a guy who was loved by no one (not even the author himself). Ouch."

"456",455,"Jalyssia King","Not a big fan..."
"457",456,"Krishna Kumar","This is supposed to be Fitzgerald’s masterpiece, but I found it less than overwhelming. I guess the main problem is that the central character Gatsby remains too much of an enigma for too long and then the story pulls the rug from under him unnecessarily. His behavior is unrealistic, at least by today’s standards, and hence we cannot identify with him or his concerns. We couldn’t care less about the vapid narrator Nick Carraway’s problems and hence the book lacks a center of gravity.The shortness of the novel contributes to this problem. There is little time to develop the characters or the relationship between them. Perhaps this was intended to show how materialistic and shallow the characters are. But even if that is the case, there is no counter-point. There are a couple of instances where the narrator tries to introduce a more meaningful point of reference, but those plot points are never pursued. The dynamics between Jay Gatsby, Tom Buchanan and Daisy Buchanan are not explored enough and the background stories are left very vague.I also have concerns about how accurate in real-life some of the incidents could be. Perhaps this is an indication of how different today’s society is from that of the 1920’s. But many plot points are rather unbelievable and the characters do not respond or talk like normal human beings sometimes. Finally, I hate stories that have “convenient” death(s) that avoids the need for proper resolution of its conflicts. In real life, people have to make choices and live with them. Many novelists prefer the Greek tragedy approach where fate resolves all issues.Obviously books like these are pretty well written. There are quotable quotations galore. But truly, the emperor has no clothes. “The Great Gatsby” is a second-rate story disguised in fine clothes and helped along by a multitude of critics who somehow managed to find hidden meanings and symbolism in it. The myth of the novel has been so built up that the clear-eyed reader who points out the obvious is snubbed by so-called literary experts."

"472",471,"Francesco","Questo libro viene sempre osannato come un capolavoro. Bene, a me ha fatto abbastanza schifo.Sia chiaro, l'atmosfera degli Anni Venti americani è tratteggiata divinamente, e i personaggi sono anche ben caratterizzati: è proprio la storia che non mi è piaciuta, il modo troppo lento e ""stagnante"" con cui i fatti vengono raccontati, l'eccessiva esagerazione e drammaticità dei comportamenti. "
"473",472,"Francesca","Sooooo boring!!!!"
"474",473,"Emma Schouten","I had wanted to read this book for a while, and eventually I had to read it for school. First of all, it wasn't about a magician/illusionist like I thought it would be. Call me stupid for thinking that but I definitely wasn't the only one. If you put 'the great' in front of a name, you expect a magician. So that was Disappointment #1.Now, after having read the book, I have to admit that it wasn't amazing. Sure, it was easy to read and easy to understand, but this story was just boring. Especially since I had high hopes. Daisy came across as an airhead, Tom as a brute, and Gatsby as a bit of child. Disappointment #2.If I never have to hear about it again after the end of the semester, I won't mind one bit."

"478",477,"Abbey","I read The Great Gatsby in high school like just about everyone was made to do, and I seriously disliked it. I later chalked that up to disliking both my teacher who made us over-analyze the blasted thing & the most other kids in my class, and I decided that I would re-read it someday to see if I liked it better when I was older.Well. I'm now six or seven years older, and I again had to read this for a class. And I still don't like it. I think I like Nick alright, but I don't understand why he ultimately likes Gatsby so much. Gatsby seems kind of, I dunno, flat (or something) to me. I can't get a clear picture of him. And his whole desprately waiting around for Daisy is ridiculous. Daisy and Tom and Jordan never seem to progress. The whole thing just seems very static to me. And I don't get why Nick & Jordan help Gatsby begin his affair with Daisy. I know it was the 20s, but still. I admit that it was well-written, and I think I like Fitzgerald's style. But I just don't like this book."

If, after reading over half the book, I am still lost, not understanding the book, and waiting for something to happen, it's time to quit. I don't like reading books that make me feel like I need my high school English teacher to explain the point of the book to me. Maybe I'll see the movie instead.

"492",491,"Brad","The Great Gatsby wasn't really a book I would like to read. I understand why it was chosen for the roaring twenties because it was about what was going on in the 1920's, but it just wasn't that well of a book in my opinion because it just didn't have that same hook to it as most books do. I felt like I was reading history more than what normal books have. But that makes this book unique. It makes you think you are reading a history text book more than a actual book. Two things that make this book stand out are the Valley of Ashes, and The Eyes Of DR. TJ Eckleburg. Whenever you are ""walking through the valley of ashes,"" ""The Eyes of DR. TJ Eckleburg"" will always be looking down on you to make sure you are always safe. "
"493",492,"Frank Rogers","I gave it a one simply because I had to read this story when I was a kid and I almost turned my back on reading all together. It's not possible for me to enjoy a book about characters I don't care about. That is all."
"495",494,"Mckinnus","I have read this book twice and didn't like it either time (in my 20s and then again in my 30s). This book is a good view of people who are so in to themselves that only thier social circle matters. It's too hard to read about the priviledged who think they don't have enough. I'd rather read a Vougue magazine than this again."

"508",507,"Jeri","The back cover of this book says it ""stands as the supreme achievement of [F. Scott Fitzgerald's:] career."" That doesn't say much for his career. The first three-quarters of the book I kept wondering if there was any purpose in the story. Just a bunch of snooty people partying around, and about an affair. Now that I've finished the book, my opinion of New Yorkers in the 1920's is not too high--selfish, self-absorbed, pompous, etc. Frankly, I thought it a dumb story. I'm glad the book was short (180 pages)."
"510",509,"Wbutler","Probably the worst, most boring story I've ever encountered. I realize this is viewed by many as one of the great all-time novels but from my perspective, the characters were like paper, the story was lack luster, and the writing style seemed designed to put the reader to sleep. Worst of all, there was no point where I actually cared what happened to anyone in the story."
"511",510,"Bunny","I'm not a fan of this book at all. I find people look into the symbolism way too much and it doesn't leave me with a different sense of the world. Though it is highly rated, I am not a fan in the least. Highly overrated!"

"517",516,"Martin","I didn't get it. Not a word of it. I'm supposed to understand that the book was filled with metaphors for the characters' moods and for the era in which it was set. Big deal. The book was just a big, fat hedonistic, solipsistic pile of nonsense and emptiness. I read through it because I was pot-committed due to its ""classic"" status, but had it been 20 pages longer, I would have gone the rest of my life without reading it. Now I have to find that great book that should have been read in the time I wasted reading this garbage."
"518",517,"Chloe Jewell","Boring......no offense.....but boring all the same"
"519",518,"Isabel","Let me start this review with a disclaimer: One of the reasons that I disliked this book so much was because it contained one of my own personal book pet peeves. I also had to read this book for school, which pretty much served to dampen any sort of excitement I might have felt to start this book. To begin I HATE pretty much any book with a weak or passive main character. Yeah I get that using a minor character to tell the story is an actual literary technique used in this particular book, however this only served to make me rather disinterested in everything. I want the characters in any of the books I read to offer some new, relatable, or thought provoking, thoughts, actions, and outlooks on life. I want to be excited or at the very least invested in my main characters. Nick, the main character, just seems to go along with everything. A lot of the times when Nick thought certain things, it didn't feel to me at all that he was actually thinking those things but that the author was trying to sound smart on a piece of paper. So by the end when some sorta exciting things happened, I honestly just did not care. Really wish I just shmooped this book."

"526",525,"White","Borrring. Pointless. This is one of those books that you suffer through because someone told you to then you get to the end and get pissed off that you did. There was no meaning whatsoever. Though it is full of skilled attempts at foreshadowing and metaphoring, it's not worth it. Characters are dry as ice, unlikeable, and you have no interest whatsoever because there's nothing to connect to. Ew. I first gave this book a 2 then decided it wasn't even worthy of that. I read this book long ago. It was so bad, it was memorable."
"527",526,"Elijah Fordham","I thought this book was terrible. I have no idea how it became a classic."
"528",527,"Edyta","I was in high school when I've read it the first time. Didn't like it. Years later (more specifically - a few weeks back) I thought to myself: let's try again - my English improved, so maybe it'll be better. After all, classics are classics for some reasons, right?Well, my English definitely improved, but the book unfortunately hasn't. Still find it boring and annoying. Shame."
"529",528,"Maryann","Reading Challenge: Read a book with a love triangleSince this is a classic, it was hard for me to give it such a low rating. I have to be honest, I did not like this book in the least. I only kept reading so I could check it off my list, and I couldn't fathom any other love triangle books being any better."
"531",530,"Wesley","This is one of the worst books ever."
"532",531,"Reedblackburn","I want a book that when I finish it I want to be better or to be inspired of feel better after I read it, or just a good old fun story. This was the exact opposite of all of that. The characters were all so lame, the girl lead reminded me of Bella, just stupid. The men were all pigs. It was just weird, I constantly felt like I had missed something, like I wasn't understanding it right. But I did, and it was just a lame story.I understand some people might love this because it's beautiful literature. I don't know enough about words to distinguish beautiful literature from twighligh literature, although it does seem beautiful literature means more detail, more words I don't know, and being more confused. Because I don't understand beautiful, classic, good, or (insert positive adjective here) literature, which I think has to be the only reason someone would like this, I disliked the book.All this being said, I am excited for the movie."

"535",534,"Grace","Read for school.I HATE this book.I really, really, REALLY HATE this book.I just. No. Can't stand it.I mean, I get it's supposed to be like a satire of the lifestyle of rich people in the thirties and how silly their problems are, but seriously. No. I hate the characters. I never want to read this again. EVER."
"536",535,"Kat","I really didn't like this book. When I had to read it in school I couldn't even get through it, which didn't work out great for my final grade but that's irrelevant. I decided to give it a try once again and had to force myself to finish it. It took me about a week, which is extra long for how short it actually is, to read it. Aside from Nick and Mr. Wilson all of the characters are very unlikable. I think that Gatsby's intentions come from a very superficial place. (view spoiler)[ I don't think that Gatsby ever actually loved Daisy, he loved that she was rich and beautiful, he loved that this rich and beautiful girl actually fell for him when there were other, more deserving, boys vying for her attention. Because of that it's really hard to sympathize with him and find any real merit in his over the top ""romantic"" gesture.  (hide spoiler)] I don't think that many comments on Tom and Daisy are necessary. They're obviously self-serving spoiled brats, even if you factor in the way the society worked in those days. "

I've seen enough soap operas and gossip rags, I don't need to read an old book about the same stuff. "

Well it turns out that Daisy and Mr.Gatsby were lovers before Mr.Gatsby joined the military. At first Daisy try to be loyal to her cheating husband, but after awhile she falls back in love with Gatsby... And poor Nick gets stuck right in the middle of the hole thing...The movie and the book are quite close. The story line is basically the same. Nevertheless in the movie Nick sets up Daisy and Gatsby at his house. I believe that the location was some were else in the book though. And In the movie Nick seems more like a side charter. Wile in the book he is the main charter.If you like sops you would like this book. I do not like sops. The whole book is about committing adultery. And it is just wrong. "

Ella es el ejemplo que siendo tonta y bonita de todos modos ""sufres"". (view spoiler)[ La verdad es que ni tanto sufrimiento,lo de ella era un caso de tengo todo en el mundo pero quiero más, ni siquiera podemos hablar sobre que Tom era violento porque el libro pasa por alto ese hecho, lo unico que vemos de Daisy es a una mujer inestable emocionalmente y más tonta que una puerta ¿pero sufrimiento?

Fitzgerald shows us that the American Dream, which is the notion that any person can have success against the odds..is dead. This review is weak. I will revise ASAP. "

I have to admit I probably did not give it a fair shake the first time I read it which was in high school as required reading. I was also reading William Burroughs’ Naked Lunch at the same time and became obsessed with that book. Therefore, I decided to give it another shot a few years ago and I still hated it. I think this book is okay at best, there is so much hype about how wonderful it is, but I just cannot like it. I do not see the appeal and because of this book, I will probably never read anything else by Fitzgerald."
"583",582,"Ceinwenn","I love the clothing of the 20′s & while I appreciate that it wasn’t necessarily a great time in American history, with the Stock Market crash, Prohibition, Gangsters etc, but you have to admit that the clothes were great! I had wanted to go see The Great Gatsby at the cinema, but my other half wouldn’t go see it with me unless I read the book first. I should have realised it was a trick! He knows I am not a great lover of the “Classics” – I really cannot say I have picked up a “Classic” to read & have walked away after finishing thinking “I am so glad I read that book!”. More like “Oh lord, that was painful!”. They bore me. Sadly, Gatsby didn’t break the pattern.The Great Gatsby takes place during the summer of 1922, in Long Island, New York. The story is narrated by an apprentice bond trader named Nick Carraway, who is Gatsby’s neighbour, & he takes us through the summer by narrating the interactions between his cousin, Daisy, her husband Tom Buchanan, Gatsby & himself. It’s a summer filled with parties, weird interactions with millionaires, petrol station owners, actors, actresses and small-time gangsters. It’s a story full of love triangles, deceit, parties, well, and not much else.I really don’t understand what makes this book a classic. It is meant to be one of the best examples of American literature….Well, I found the characters annoying, didn’t like Fitzgerald’s writing style & had to force myself to finish it. I was bored with the whole thing & was quite glad when it was finished. And I never did see the film, lol!"
"584",583,"Sydney Gottlieb","This book is a classic. This book is told by a guy named Mr. Carroway. He moves to a new house in New York and lives next to a mansion owned by Gatsby. My favorite part of the book is the parties that Gatsby throws. At least half of New York is there but only a couple are actually invited. This book was okay because it was very confusing to understand at some parts but later on you figure out that something just doesn't add up with Mr. Gatsby and you want to figure out. That is why I gave it 1 out of 5 stars."
"585",584,"Jarred","Hated it"
"586",585,"Patrick S.","How this is an American classic, I will never know. The book is short and barely has any character development. You don't route for anyone nor really care about finding about anybody's back story - including Gatsby himself. The book does do an ok job of portraying that ""rich, post-World War I, 1920s era apathy generation"" but the problem with portraying apathy is that your readers are going to be apathetic. There is one part of the book that has some ""action"" in it but it's so shoe horned in for the sole purpose of rapping up the story that it's almost unbelievable. For those that poo-poo Twilight for ""stalker"" type mentality of Edward, you have the same behavior in Gatsby as well. I was very underwhelmed and feel sorry for the countless public school students who had to suffer through this book. The one positive thing I can say is that it wasn't as boring as ""Wuthering Heights"". Final Grade - F"

"592",591,"Josie clark","I find that this book makes a better movie than a book. Fitzgerald uses a bit too much detail for my taste, and it causes the story to be a bit boring at times. I think that like most classics; I find reading the book to be pointless when the characters that you are learning so much about all die at the end. It is a constant problem with these books, and I just wish the authors did not sever my ties with the main characters right at the end of the book./ "
"593",592,"Eric Mesa","I LOVE reading. And the high school where I read this book over a decade ago had some really awesome reading assignments. This was not one of them. I've read other works by F. Scott Fitzgerald and I think the problem is that I don't like his style. It's been a long time so I can't remember all the details, but I think it has to do with the fact that, considering what Gatsby does for a living, the story could have been so much more exciting. Instead it read, if I remember correctly, as ""poor rich people. They look like they're having so much fun, but they're dead inside."""

"598",597,"Carie Mari","This was one of those books that irritated me. I know its supposed to be great literature, but I thought it was depressing. I just wanted to smack the characters and tell them to figure it out. They all have so much money and they still can't find hapiness? I know that money can't find happiness, but it sure can do a lot of good in this world and they were all just so self-centered about how to find that happiness. Do a little volunteer work! Spread the wealth and enjoy society more. I guess I get on a soapbox too often but I just didn't really enjoy tis book. "

"604",603,"Thomas Mangnall","The worst book I've ever finished. A selection (don't remember how many, don't care) of identical 1 dimensional characters with no backstory whatsoever do absolutely nothing. They go to a party hosted by a mysterious man and hear some exciting rumours about him, then nothing happens. They go to another identical party and here the same rumours again, then nothing happens. They go to another identical party, here the same rumours again, meet the mysterious Gatsby, find out that the truth is frivolous, unbelievable and absurd, then nothing happens. By this point I'd long lost any sort of affinity for any of these cardboard identical tedious characters and didn't care in any way what happened to them, fortunately nothing did until the last few pages but by then I still didn't care. The most tedious book I've ever read, no back story to all bar one of the characters, none of them develop in any way and nothing happens to any of them. This book is 100% hype and absolutely no substance, take the cover off and it'd be a huge flop instead of the ""modern classic"" we're all told it is. "

Blog reviews often contain links which are not reproduced here, nor will updates or modifications to the blog review be replicated here. Graphic and children's novels reviewed on the blog will generally have some images from the book's interior, which are not reproduced here.Note that I don't really do stars. To me a novel is either worth reading or it isn't. I can't rate a novel three-fifths worth reading! The only reason I've relented and started putting stars up there is to credit the good ones, which were being unfairly uncredited. So, all you'll ever see from me is a five-star or a one-star (since no stars isn't a rating, unfortunately).I rated this novel WARTY!WARNING! MAY CONTAIN UNHIDDEN SPOILERS! PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!Fitzgerald write this in 1925, but it's set three years earlier in the summer of 1922, and tells a story of some wealthy characters observed and narrated by a not-so-wealthy character, Nick Carraway, during their time in the fictional resort location of West Egg on Long Island sound.Carraway is a prospective bond salesman new to the area, and he rents a place which happens to be next door to the magnificent residence owned by Jay Gatsby (whose real name is James Gatz, Jimmy to his father). Nick has dinner one evening with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, the burly Tom, an old acquaintance from college, and meets intriguing Jordan Baker, with whom he begins an affair.It's through her that Nick learns that his cousin's husband is having an affair with one Myrtle Wilson, but he appears to have no problem with that because he attends a raunchy party with Tom and Myrtle where, as it happens, Tom punches her and breaks her nose.One day Nick receives an invitaiton to one of Gatsbys famous parties which he;s seen but never attended. He's intrigued by the invitation brought over by Gatsby's chauffer, so he attends and finds himself invited to an audience with Gatsby himself - a curious man who never attends his own parties, seems constantly busy with business schemes, and for some reason appears to take a shine to Nick.It turns out that his interest in Nick is actually an interest in Nicks's cousin, Daisy, with whom Gatsby was in a relationship many years before, but which couldn't be pursued due to Nick's poverty. After they separated, Gatsby inherited some money and parlayed that into an empire, and now he wants to get back with Daisy, but Daisy has married - something he had not expected her to do.He pursuades Nick to invite Daisy - alone - to tea one day, and the two begin bonding again, and spending more and more time together. Despite his own affair, Tom begins to grow concerned about where his wife is spending her free time. A showdown comes in New York at an hotel which Daisy, Gatsby, Jordan, Nick, and Tom visit one really hot day. Gatsby outright announces Daisy's love for him, although Daisy protests and gives Gatsby a surprise by announcing her love for Tom, who in turn, denounces Gatsby as a criminal.The gathering breaks up and Tom allows Gatsby and Daisy to travel together back to the Egg to demonstrate how little concerned he is, but Daisy drives and accidentally kills Tom's mistress Myrtle somehow. The latter's husband, who has come to the conclusion that Gatsby is the lover he's begun to suspect his wife has taken, tracks down this yellow car which killed his wife, and he fatally shoots Gatsby and then himself. Nick, disillusioned with this life on the eastern shores, moves back to the midwest.Throughout listening to this on audio, I wavered between liking it and then disliking it. In the end I cannot recommend it because the dislikes far outweighed the likes in the final analysis. Fitzgerald does have an interesting turn of phrase here and there, but his writing tended far too often, when it wasn't merely mundane, to descend into endless lists of things which I found irritating as hell.The story is ok, but it's not particularly brilliant or inventive and I really don't think it's meritous of the acclaim it seems to have today. I'd recommend reading the wikipedia entry on it, however, which is quite interesting. This novel is based on real people whom Fitzgerald himself knew."

"612",611,"Lance Woods","From what I understand, opinions of ""Gatsby"" are pretty cleanly divided between love it/hate it. I get that Fitzgerald is considered by many to be the literary voice of the Jazz Age, and I mean no disrespect to those who share that opinion, but when I finished reading this book, I just couldn't understand why. Fitzgerald did manage to fire off a few sentences and phrases that I found memorable, but I honestly finished this 1920s ""Less Than Zero"" wondering why it's considered a classic -- and why so many people have been trying to turn THIS into a movie for so many years.Here's the ironic thing: It makes me want to read more of Fitzgerald's works just so I can find out if he gets any better. Backhanded praise? Maybe. But at least I'd like to give him another shot at adding me to his legion of fans before discounting him outright."
"614",613,"Sadie","This book is--to me--the epitome of how tragic and meaningless your life can be if you try to make satisfying your personal desires and depending on other people to fulfill those desires the purpose of your whole life. This was a very tragically sad story, and I recommend that anyone who reads it will soon find that only Christ can satisfy all of your desires, and that serving Him alone should be your utmost goal in life. "

"616",615,"Brandon Hunter","Dear Potential Reader, The Great Gatsby is an okay book about love, hate, friendship,betrayal, symbolism, murder, and money. The book starts off as the narrator, also known as Nick Carraway, moving to a town named West Egg. Nick Carraway is a 1915 Yale Graduate. When Nick moved to West Egg, he made a new friend, named Jay Gatsby. Jay Gatsby is a millionaire that likes to throw parties. He throws great parties every Saturday night that can last until 3 am. Nick has a married cousin named Daisy. Daisy and Gatsby used to be together, but things between them occurred even though they are both still in love with each other. The only problem is that Daisy is currently married to a man that goes by the name of Tom Buchanan. She has very little feelings for Tom, but much more feelings for Tom. Gatsby doesn't want anything but to be able to see Daisy one more time. The only person that can help him do this is Nick and he will help. What nobody knows is that there is more inside Daisy's and Tom's Relationship. Tom has a girl on the side and he trusts Nick well enough to let him meet her.I think that this book is okay and I would not recommend this book to other people. Thank you, Brandon Hunter"
"617",616,"Logan","I literally could not finish it. I got about 50 pages in, realized I didn't care about the characters or the plot, found everything to be overly pretentious and snobby, and despised every minute of reading this book. "
"618",617,"Grace Fullerton","Well written, full of symbolism, but depressing. I don't give 5 stars to books that make me lose hope in humanity and the American dream- because my forefathers gave everything they had for that dream and they accomplished it. It meant something real to them and I refuse to mock their memory by condoning the erroneous message given by this book that people can never truly achieve happiness or the American dream."
"619",618,"Dorina","I can only think of one word that can fully describe this book: boring. I cannot understand why it is considered as one of the greatest novels ever written.No plot, no interesting characters. No way.170 pages of useless information and meaningless conversations between idiots. Who is Gatsby? Does Daisy love Gatsby? Does she want Tom? And what about Nick? Oh wait. I don't care.Why on earth should a constant moaning of someone's pathetic life be interesting?A complete waste of words, paper and time. "

"629",628,"Megan Franks","I'm sorry, why is this considered beloved American literature? This is the second time I've read The Great Gatsby, and it didn't get any better. Shallow, self-absorbed characters living a life of leisure, deceit, and pervasive immorality...why is this canonized into the list of ""Great American Novels?"" Sure, Fitzgerald has a way with words, but his eloquent writing couldn't off-set the ridiculously depressing storyline. Don't get me wrong: I'm not a girl who requires happily-ever-after stories, but I will NOT read this a third time. I can't.Still, I think almost any piece of literature has value. There are at least two lessons to be learned: 1) Wealth does not equal happiness.2) Putting all your trust into one person to fulfill your happiness is faulty because people will disappoint (or die)."
"630",629,"Carlos Burga","I cannot give a proper review of this book because I read it when I was a moody fifteen-year-old who understood none of its metaphors and was upset about the lack of “action” in the story.

"637",636,"Christian Rowley","I think this was a great book because it displays the complexity of F.Scott Fitzgerald's writing. He uses color imagery to symbolize various things. For example, the color red is associated with death, the color green with the american dream, and yellow with sickness. Also, he uses the main character Nick to show the point of view of Gatsby and so we can really see the experience of the book through someone else's eyes.The Great Gatsby wasn't one of my favorite books. However, it was one that opened my eyes a lot. It showed me that life is full of desires and sometimes obtaining those desires are futile. Moreover, I learned to not ever give up and go after whatever i wanted like Gatsby did with his desires. "

"644",643,"McGooglykins","I re-read this book today because seeing the adverts for the film recently made me realise that I couldn't remember anything much happening, beyond the final few chapters and a general sense of disliking the overall work. As it turns out, I didn't need to re-read it, because nothing much *does* happen, and I really did dislike it for itself and not just because I didn't gel with the ending well. This is one of those Classic Books that everybody tells you that you should read, and you should love, and that it contains Important Messages for you to take away. That should have been a clue for me, right there, because invariably when a book is labelled as such, I have found that I dislike it for various reasons and feel that, at least in part, my time has been wasted by reading it. I appreciate that many people love this, and I'm glad for them, but I found it dull and tedious from beginning to end. "

"652",651,"Preston Moore","Here is a review on a book that I really dislike. The Great Gatsby, by Fitzgerald F. Scott, was a book that I had to read for one of my english classes. I found this book confusing to read and even going over it in class it was still confusing. It seems like the book was written at a time when certain slang words in the book would make since when it was written but today I just absolutly make's no sense. The overall basis from what I remember is that the main charater, a upper-middle class guy, lives next to the mansion of Gastsby. Gastby was a very rich indidual who attained his wealth by questionalbe methods. The book envolves drama where relationships shift and change, with the main charater as the observer. Overall I would not recommend reading this book, unless you enjoy classic literature."
"653",652,"Chloe Forgie-williams","The Great Gatsby is about the unreality and inaccessibility of the American Dream. In the Great Gatsby success and achievement are narrowly defined as wealth and power therefore it is obvious that if that's one's aim and vision of happiness in America their fight for it will be corrupt and unfair despite putting in long hours of hard work. Jay Gatsby symbolizes the corrupt aspect of the American Dream and Wilson a garage owner who despite working hard and starting his own business remains poor. The story is told by Nick Carroway who is both an outsider, financially, and an insider as Daisy's cousin. He clearly notes the contrast between the wealthy and the poor through colours. Fitzgerald surrounds the failure of the American Dream with senseless romance between Gatsby and Daisy. The character Daisy is unintelligent, vapid and as the story goes on becomes increasingly irritating. She is an archetype for those who have excessive amounts of wealth without earning any of it themselves, her only challenge she has faced has been pleasing powerful men such as Tom or Gatsby. Her friend Jordan Baker is more inspiring in her athletic success and cunning however Fitzgerald choses to make her dishonest and therefore undermines any success she had in the man's world as a young woman. I found this book slow moving because of its constant focus on wealth and would have been more intrigued if Gatsby's business as a bootlegger had been more closely examined. "

"660",659,"Meatina","Whilst I appreciate this is lauded as a masterpiece of modern literature, I could not bring myself to like this book. I found it hard to get into, and it was only in the last twenty or so pages things really began to happen. I found the characters were not rounded enough- I appreciate that this was the point, that they hid behind a mask of glee and glitter, but even as those masks fell away and I began to feel some sympathy for Gatsby, the last actions he takes in the book snatched those feelings away.I am coming to this book over 90 years since it was written- so yes, morals have changed, and maybe if I had been around to read it at the time of publication I would have enjoyed it more, but I doubt this. There are many good love stories out there- this is not one of them."
"661",660,"Courtney Cantrell","I didn't enjoy this at all and don't understand why the literary world is enamored of it. Nothing happens until the last 20-30 pages, and then it's just all depressing. Such was that era, I guess -- but I'm impressed with myself that I stuck with it long enough to ""get"" that ""moral of the story."" ;)"
"662",661,"Morgan Meyer","This is a very dry book. The story is of a young banker, and his story of his life in the Big Apple. The plot is easy to follow, but the text is very old and some of it may be hard for modern readers to relate to. This book contains some mystery, and some ""dry"" humor. It also has suspense throughout."

"664",663,"Lisa Williamson","The great American novel.... well, for some maybe. For me I was left feeling like I had wasted part of my life by deciding to read this book. I know that sounds harsh, but it's a personal view of The Great Gatsby. I found the story line dry and rather pointless, and in need of some serious drama. Following the life of Gatsby through his parties and love for a highly strung woman was not as exciting as it should have been. However, I am glad I persevered with it, yet I will not be reliving it or recommending it. From other reviews I can see that I'm quite alone in this conclusion, but each to their own."

Esto te hace suponer que el libro en cuestión es bueno, a lo que si añadimos su estatus de clásico, pensamos que tenemos una joya en nuestras manos... Pues nada más alejado de la realidad.Empecé el libro con mucha curiosidad, pero desde el principio el narrador, Nick Carraway, me pareció insulso y algo aburrido. Nick es quien nos va guiando a lo largo de la historia y nos va presentando a los diferentes personajes de la novela. Inicialmente nos presenta a su prima Daisy, y al marido de ésta, Tom Buchanan. Ambos juegan un papel importante en la historia, pero no os supondrá ninguna sorpresa quién es el protagonista más importante de todos. Nada más y nada menos que el rico, famoso (y a la vez misterioso) vecino de Nick: Jay Gatsby. El señor Gatsby es muy conocido por sus divertidas fiestas, a donde la gente acude (casi siempre sin invitación) para pasárselo en grande y a la vez intentar averiguar de dónde sacó el señor Gatsby su fortuna.Gatsby y Nick se hacen amigos rápidamente, pero a lo largo de la novela no puedes dejar de pensar que hay algo raro en Gatsby. Su halo misterioso tiene que estar escondiendo algo... Aunque no es el caso de Nick, alguno de los otros personajes intentará desenmascarar a Gatsby (por diversas razones que no comentaré aquí para no tener spoilers xD). ¿Qué estarán dispuestos a hacer para conseguirlo? P.D. Si me permitís el consejo, ahorraros la lectura del libro y poneos alguna de las películas que han hecho (creo que las más famosas son la de Robert Redford o la última, donde aparece Leonardo Dicaprio)."
"704",703,"southernmyst","Reading this story was a pointless waste of my time. The characters weren't developed, such that I didn't care when death visited the book. The characters weren't drawn so as to seem real, so the death didn't seem real. Gatsby alone was a multi-faceted character; everyone else was very one-dimensional - I reckon that was part of Fitzgerald's point, but it didn't make for entertaining reading. While a word wasn't wasted, and it was far richer than most contemporary writing because of that and because of the word choice (many words are ones you simply don't see often these days) it's only a crude story at the moment. It was entirely too flat to be a story that entertains or educates or provokes thought or draws in - at least, it did none of these things for me.---I'm also so dismayed that while Wordsworth was changing the words and punctuation that Fitzgerald wrote to British English, they didn't correct Fitzgerald's mistaken ""he'd of"" that appears throughout the text. (Since it is the only thing that could possibly be an attempt at dialect, it sticks out like a sore thumb and looks like a mistake). Either leave what the author wrote (and his own editor(s) agreed on) alone, or correct it all. I shan't bother buying a Wordsworth book again. "

"708",707,"Vincent D'Antonio"," Dear Potential Readers,The Great Gatsby is a good book but personally I didn't care for it. This book represented symbolism in many different ways. Two of the most common ways of symbolism is ""The Valley of Ashes"" and the ""Eyes of Dr. TJ Eckleburg.""The Great Gatsby is an okay book about many different things and different situations. It shows how things can’t ever be the way they seem. It starts off with a Yale graduate named Nick Caraway moving to a town called West Egg. He knows that he is going to have a lot of things there, some good and some bad, but he has no idea in what’s really in for him.Nick was fortunate enough to be able to live to this millionaire named Jay Gatsby. Little does he know, he just moved in next to his new best friend. It takes a little bit of time but they finally meet at a party thrown by Jay Gatsby himself. Jay Gatsby throws a lot of parties. Many people think that he throws great parties. They can last up until 3 am in the morning.All Gatsby wants is to see a woman, Nick’s cousin named Daisy. The only problem is that Daisy is now married. Even though she is married, she’s still in love with Jay. She doesn’t tell her husband, but she does. What Daisy doesn’t know is that her husband has another girl that he has on the side.This book is a boring book and really self-centered and has a lot of symbolism. It is not a book I would read again. Thank you, Vincent D’Antonio"

"710",709,"Jade Taylor","I studied this book for my English Literature AS Level and I can honestly say, 4 years on, that I have never found such little enjoyment in a book before. I appreciate the book being 'well-written' from a literary perspective. However from a simple readers perspective I found it boring, self indulged and I did not empathise with any of the characters. This book irritated me, quite a lot. "

I don't care how classic it is, it was boring, and nothing about it screamed ""roaring 20s"" except for the strange language and strange writing style. Now I remember why for most of my adult life I hated to read. It was because they made us read books like this in high school (which I'm assuming I struggled through one of, and then stopped... because I never read any of this bullshit in high school... And still graduated top ten). I don't know, maybe I'm stupid for not getting it the entire time? But I didn't get it... The entire time. I mean, I get the gist of the story but, my God, it was painful. I only read this to prepare for a friend's Gatsby themed wedding. I should have just watched the movie because I still have no idea. Ugh. Thank God I've realized now all books are not like this."

This is for my f2f bookclub, I found it a total bore. I can understand the plot and the time and the so called American Dream is what this book is about oh and the Jazz Age, but I just hated the tone and could not stand Daisy. Yawn, so glad there are better books out there with characters to be fond of and to remember. I just felt that the book had this anger towards wealth like it's such a bad thing. Rolling my eyes. Honestly, I think the author's real life along with his wife seem more interesting. From what I understand, this book did not sell when it was first published. Glad I had the chance to re-visit something I felt I may have missed from my younger years, but see now, that I have not."

I think there are better books out there that personify the ""Great American Novel,"" besides this non-commital of a tale. Everyone is in love with everyone else, and I just don't care that the light across the water symbolizes his hope. It's not my favorite."
"728",727,"Amy Murphy","I only got through half the book. I kept thinking about English Lit questions about the plot, setting, protagonist, antagonist rather than enjoying the story. It gave me anxiety and I ended up putting the book to rest. I guess I'm not a fan of the classics, so kill me."

"734",733,"Sergio","	The book The Great Gatsby starts off with Nick meeting up with his cousin Daisy, her husband Tom Buchanan, and their friend Jordan Baker. Soon after, Nick meets Tom’s other lover Myrtle Wilson. When Nick suddenly gets invited to Mr. Gatsby, his neighbor’s party, he decides to go not thinking about it too much. Nick later finds out that Gatsby is madly in love with his cousin Daisy. When Nick arranges a date for the two to meet up he does not realize what lies ahead. Tom finds out about Daisy and Gatsby being in love with each other and begins to lose it. Not being able to handle the situation, Daisy decides to drive away with Gatsby in Tom’s car. Myrtle recognizing her true loves’ car runs towards the car where she is then ran over by the stressed driver. Myrtle Wilson’s husband sees the car kill his wife and recognizes it later when it is parked in Gatsby’s place. Gatsby is then blamed by Mr. Wilson and is shot by the crazed man. This book reminded me a lot about new, modern shiny objects. That kind of stuff is an inverse of what you would read about in Harry Potter books. In a Harry Potter book, everything is old, dusty and dim but in The Great Gatsby, everything is clean, new and very bright. The book gives you a very exultant yet sad and dark feel which is also relevant to the Harry Potter series. The Great Gatsby is a young man who will do significant things for those he loves. Harry Potter also does great things that show his love for people. This book and that series are different in many ways yet they still can be very similar despite the fact that one is a fantasy and the other is a Fictional story. I did not really enjoy the book The Great Gatsby but I really did enjoy Harry Potter. Perhaps it is because I am more into the fantasy type of books rather than the more fictional kinds."

"744",743,"Ellen","I didn't like this book much when I read it as a pre-teen. I thought Gatsby was a ""git"" and I didn't like any of the other characters either. I am told this is one of the greatest American novels of the 20th century... guess I'd like to read it again. Since 1977, I have also read a wonderful biography of Fitzgerald's Editor: Max Perkins, Editor of Genius by A. Scott Berg. It rekindled my interst in this book because Perkins was so involved in making it happen."
"745",744,"Geraldine Gomez Ruiz","Just went to see the movie the other day with my friends. It reminded me of how much I loathed this book and the story. It's a very quick paced read. The plot line is not easy. Definitely not comprehensible if you are not paying attention. The first time I read it I didn't know who killed who, so going into the movie I didn't quite remember what had happened at the end. But just like the book, I simply could not care for the characters. The characters are all quite stereotypical, I do like the fact that Gatsby creates this image of himself and most people just accept it as such, don't even bother to question his authority and where he or it comes from. But altogether, I just didn't feel engaged to the story or the characters for that matter. The book reminded me of how much I hate when people gossip, speak untruths, talk about people you do not care for/about. Maybe I'll give this book another shot in a few years... maybe. "
"747",746,"Tessa Duncan","Honestly, this was a struggle for me to read. The writing is just page upon page of description with little actually happening. I felt that the plot quietly gets nowhere, and even when something exciting does happen, the writing style lets the action down. I didn't like how relationships between characters were made, developed and then shattered at the end, it made the entire book seem like a waste of time. I know a lot of people love this book and say it says a lot about the American Dream, and maybe it does. Maybe I'm just not old enough or good enough at finding themes to fully appreciate this book."

Un libro aburrido para mi y que no me deja nada, a pesar de que el final me tomó por sorpresa no fue lo que esperaba de este gran clásico que muchos aman, tal vez no fue el momento adecuado o simplemente no era para mi este libro, pero no me gustó."

"753",752,"Alex Gildey","I baffles me that people consider 'The Great Gatsby' to be one of the best books ever written. To me the plot is clichéd and boring, the characters, with the exception of Tom, are bland and uninteresting and the social commentary falls flat on its pretensions arse. I only have to assume F. Scott Fitzgerald had his head so far up his own rectum, he didn't realize what he was writing was utter horse shit. Or then again Fitzgerald could be the Ed Wood of the literary industry. This is by far and away one of the worst books I have ever read, stay as far away from this as possible and instead read a book with one of the most, if not the most, interesting plots in a book ever, the best character in literary history and very direct social commentary, Fight Club.

"767",766,"Ronda","Why they make you read this in highschool is beyond me. I remembered nothing about the book except that it was boring and on the 2nd reading. Still boring, until the end. I forgot someone died, actually 2 people, but the way he wrote it I didn't even realize Gatsby had died until the character blatantly tells another character later on. I feel like he wrote most of the book in this obscure way without revealing too much to maintain mystery, but it was just hard to read at times, and the lack of action and the over reflection of events by the character that barely made sense and were hardly relevant just took away from the story. He could have told the entire story in the last 10 pages. And Daisy is quite the bitch. so basically I surmise the story is about rich, snobby, careless, and irresponsible people being Daisy and Tom seen from the eyes of Nick, who in the very beginning sounds snobby and feels above everyone because they all seem so stupid, but he's not ofcourse sine he's working class. And poor Gatsby, literally, a poor man is fated to die because all he wants is to be rich, which Fitzgerald never really says how but only in short remarks and observations of the characters, something about bonds and someone went to jail because they got caught with them? And Nick and Jordan's romance was so lackluster and without feeling, but then the whole book was without feeling. Very detached, I detested all the characters, and maybe Fitzgerald wanted the whole book's mood to be as detached as Gatsby's parties. "
"768",767,"SusanwithaGoodBook","I re-read Gatsby in May because I thought I'd give it another chance with the movie coming out and all the publicity. I still find it horrible. I don't even think the characters are very well developed. I know that I'm not supposed to like the characters, and in that way it succeeds. I hate them all - just as I'm supposed to. Even the author. Hate him too. It seems self-indulgent and to have an exalted opinion of its own worth. I've read other Fitzgerald works (Tender is the Night comes to mind immediately) and felt the same way. I think Fitzgerald really should have gotten outside of his own head and his own limited society a little more. I know, I know - greatest American novel of all time, yada yada yada. I just don't get it. But I'm sure I'm just the dim bulb here, so that's fine. Y'all go ahead and enjoy it. I'll stick with more simple minded fair I suppose."

I remembered reading this in high school wishing I could pull out my teeth over reading this book and now thinking that ""well I've grown up a bit so maybe this is more enjoyable now."" My tastes apparently haven't changed that much!There was no real plot until around 3/4 of the way through and by then I was so bored it didn't matter, and even the ""action"" was so slow it didn't matter. It was just a story of rich people doing daily activities and a love triangle that is not the least bit exciting."

This novel, though very short, took me weeks to complete because it was so boring and easy to put down. I didn't get it. It had nothing to do with the language or the era it was set in.

"830",829,"Shifa khan","In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write ""something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned."" That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became The Great Gatsby, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, Gatsby captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. ""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--"" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. ""Her voice is full of money,"" Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose, The Great Gatsby is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem."

"833",832,"Noor","I had been looking forward to reading this for ages. What an absolute let-down. "
"834",833,"Darci Taylor","I really don't have much to say other than that I hated this book.I read it in class, which only worsens the cause, and I did not enjoy it in the slightest. The characters (except maybe Nick) don't have any likable traits so most of the story was very bland for me. The writing was great, sure, but I didn't enjoy mulling over every single word in class. Gosh. Maybe, had I read this book on my own, I would have liked it. But no."
"835",834,"Dan Nolte","I have no idea what this is a ""classic."" I couldn't even finished it because NOTHING happens. zzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
"836",835,"Dhen Dhen","Meh.I should have not included this on my Christmas wishlist. But hey, at least I have one more book added on my shelves.I honestly don't get why this book's popular. I really tried my best into appreciating it...but failed disastrously. I just can't get myself into it :( Not even the slightest spark of interest was present.I'll try reading it again when I'm older. Maybe then I won't be bored with it, or at least my perspective towards reading it would change."
"837",836,"Carolanne","Read this book in high school and hated it. This is usally the book that high school kids love too.

"839",838,"Emily McGovern","I hate to say it but I've given up on this at 30%. I've been trying to read some of the classics but haven't got on too well. In this book, I still can't see any particular story line and to be honest, think that makes it badly written. But perhaps that's just me and I'm missing something... Ah we'll, I read for pleasure so want to enjoy each book. This isn't for me."

I don't know what, nor what I'm missing but I always put it down at the end with a profound sense of disapointment. Just reread it and I still feel like the things I think I'm starting to understand in the middle are negated by the way the book ends.What do people take away from this novel? I got nothing!"
"842",841,"Ismail Rasheed","intresting"
"843",842,"Amber Lamky","One of my least favorite books ever. I know everyone loves it, but between the horrible characters and what seems like a painfully contrived plot, I just could not like it at all. Knowing many people’s affinity towards the novel, I even tried to read it a few years later and only made it about ten pages in before I returned it to the library. "
"846",845,"Kristen Wampner","Book Cover: Amusing but I didn't really get the carnival idea behind it. I would have rather a fancy house or a party yea..... NO STARAuthor: I just really couldn't get into this style of writing and I wanted to SO BAD! NO STARStory: My expectations were kinda crushed on this book as far as the story line and I really can't pinpoint why. NO STARCharacters: I could pick out a favorite. NO STARCleanliness: There might have been a word but I can't place it if there was. STAR Overall Review: I was just really bummed with this read. I had really high expectations but it just didn't do anything for me. I think I will try to reread it later on down the road just to give it one more chance. I really did enjoy the time setting and it really picked up towards the end but yea.... just not my favorite. "
"847",846,"Carly","I didn't enjoy this book at all. Very little as far as plot happened, I couldn't relate to any of the characters and disliked them all, and though i read the ending several times I can still not remember what happens. I realize that is written as a comment to the trivial nature of the 20s, but I had trouble enjoying it."
"848",847,"Midnight","1.5 stars and it only get the 1/2 star because of the end. Yet another book that school makes me read that I do not like. The characters were shallow and greedy. I have no interest in reading a book about rich people and their pathetic problems. I do not care how much money they spend on jewelry and on parties. I do not care for whining people who love the past. The plot was nonexistent. The writing was flowery and unnecessary and it took ten pages to say someone walked outside. Why is this a classic? Someone please tell me because I have no idea. This review is going to have spoilers in it. You have been warned. The Characters were shallow and greedy. They didn't care for anyone but themselves. They wanted money and power and they would step on anyone to get what they wanted. The only thing I felt for these characters was pity, anger and disgust. I couldn't connect with any of the characters and I do mean any of them. I liked none of them and very few did I have feelings for most.Daisy was a rude, cruel person who married for money not for love. She loved no one not her husband, not her daughter, not even her lover. She was written as though she from one second to another to change topics and that annoyed me to no end. She was written as an idiot. When Gastby told tom that she had only loved him it was bad because yes she didn't love tom but she also didn't love Gastby. Gatsby was a man living in the past. He wanted the love of a woman who didn't know how to love. He didn't even man up and ask if she liked him anymore. He thought money would get her back and it didn't. He threw wild parties in order for word of mouth to get to her and it took years for her to even go to his house. He is then killed for her and she doesn't even go to his funeral... what the hell?Tom was a man who never was told no as a child. I would never be able to stand knowing such a man as tom. Even if he was the last man on earth I wouldn't touch him with a ten foot pole. He hits people because he doesn't get his way. He physically moves people to get what he wants and he cheats on his wife. He cheats on her on their honeymoon. I fell no love for Daisy but I fell that she is treated horribly as a person by TomNick who was our narrator in this whole story. He said he was above judging people. I do not for a second believe that any human is above that. He is the most normal of the group and I found him just plain boring. Jordan honestly I think that the story would have been fine without her and we could have been told things by someone else. She is a liar and a cheater and she plays golf. She is the kind of person that makes it hard for me to get into sports because what is the fun in it if someone is just going to cheat in order to win. The Plot  There. Was. None. We went to a couple of parties. We had a fight. Someone got run over and that was about it. I don't mind books that have minimal plot but I need something to work with. I was bored throughout all of reading this the whole freaking month of reading this. The Writing was not for me. I hated it. I loathed it. It took a lot of effort in order to really understand it. Why would I read something that requires a ton of effort to understand that I wouldn't enjoy. That takes four pages to tell who was sitting where and their entire backstory. I thought that we had too much flowery language and not enough word setting up the scene, telling me what the houses look like and how these people look and I didn't get that. This might be the teenager in me talking but I would much rather read about dragons and sword fights and steam engines, magical realms where anything can happen but do we read that? no no we do not. We get to read about who is sleeping with who (I would even be happy if we had a couple of sex scenes but alas we don't have any of those either). I know this is from the 20s and things where different but i mean come on this books is crap. School This has less to do with the book and more to do with my opinion on classics in english classes. I do not understand why the school board or whoever decides what we have to do in school makes us read these classics. The problems that are faced in them are well outdated or even if they aren't out dated there are other books that are newer so people might connect with them more that deal with the same topic. The way they are written just isn't for most teenagers. I think this is why some kids do not like to read. Making them read books that just aren't really that interesting to anyone anymore (except for a few). And dissecting the book so much that I'm at the point of throwing the book at a wall and saying screw it. Why can't we have modern literature being taught? What makes the classics better than the books of today.  The Ending is the only reason this book got an extra half star. It would have been better if daisy had died I think I would have found that funny. When Gatsby died I was happy something had happened! Other than that the ending was boring and noting else happened... just like the rest of the story. Overall I hated this book. I would have never pick this book up on my own will in the first place because while it is fiction it is about the 20s and I don't really like books without something at least magic or steampunk in. I won't remember much of this book after we take the test on it which is what I am hoping for because I have too many other books that I like that need to fill my brain. "

"852",851,"Maggie Burgess"," I was assigned this book in high school, and I really had a hard time getting through it. I just never got into it. I told myself I was going to read it again as an adult, but never could bring myself to do so. The movie release was finally my reason, because honestly, I thought the trailer looked good! So I told myself I had to reread it before I could see the movie.That being said, I just reread it, and I still don't like it. I liked it better this time, but still was not a fan. To me, there were good moments, but they were few and far between, hiding between slow, flowery (but uninteresting) parts. For as slow as I felt it was, at times I felt like I had missed something and jumped back just to find that hidden between long chunks of nothing, there is one important sentence that was easy to miss. I didn't feel like characters developed much- they all stayed pretty flat. Who they were at the start is who they were at the end. I have plenty of friends who LOVE this book, so I mean no disrespect, and maybe it's just not for me, but I could not get into it at all."
"853",852,"Jay Jani","Turned out to be one of the most disappointing novels..... There is absolutely nothing in this book that matches to its fame.... extremely mundane writing with mediocre script....no humour whatsoever, not even decent romance or fierce scenes that can thrill you.... Its good that it's a thin book otherwise it can bore you to death."
"855",854,"Sylvia","I hated this book! It is supposed to be a portrayal of America, but it does not represent the life I or my ancestors have known, thank heavens!"
"856",855,"Bookcase Jim","Goodamn I hated this book. We had to read it in 11th or 12th grade English and I couldn't fuckin stand it. I was at the peak of my literary exploration at the time, going through two novels a week or more and this was just ridiculously tedious. I hated the writing, I hated the story, and I couldn't be bothered to feel a thing for Nick Carraway the lonely millionaire and his leather-bound books. If this is what Fitzgerald intended for his readers to feel, then it's a masterpiece. But I'm afraid it was just a piece of garbage that critics couldn't help falling over because it depicted the 1920s ennui & ignorance of spoiled nouveau-riches with such alacrity. Save yourself the trouble and read anything else instead. "
"857",856,"Karen Ferguson","Someone please tell me why this book is considered a classic, because I just don't get it. He couldn't follow a train of thought, conversations were clipped and almost non-existent. The people seemed rude and weird. It was generally hard to follow because of so little information given. I definitely wouldn't recommend this book o anyone."

"861",860,"Alan Van","I do not understand why this book has received the glowing praise that so many readers heap upon it. Far from great, I assessed Gatsby and his story as so-so at best. I found the characters to be noticeably lacking both character and interest. Nick, our narrator, was as bland as ice water: Tom Buchanan a despicable lout: Daisy, effete and immature: and Gatsby? Gatsby was a feckless, spineless, wannabe playboy. Apart from the contrived syncronicty of the character's relationships (Nick cousin to Daisy and neighbor to Gatsby) and the implausible irony of the hit and run accident, I found the plot mostly driven by low octane vignettes of limited interest. I was quite disappointed. "
"863",862,"Charlie","I know from my experiences in one of my second year college English classes, ""The Great American Novel"", that I am not alone in disliking this book. There were about 15 of us. We all enjoyed the other 4 classic novels more or less but, for me (and at least 14 others) this classic just sucked. It takes you into the eyes of some selfish rich guy who is obsessed with the ""girl next door."" It renders a picture of stupid selfish people who are doing stupid selfish things. The syntax is unbearably simple, there is no sense of a message, a moral, or of anything of meaning or wit to the story other than distraction. Gatsby is chewing gum for the mind. "
"864",863,"Patti","I simply hated this book. The characters were so shallow and trashy. Even the main character was going back to where he came from at the end of the story. I'd have left sooner than that except that it was an assignment in a college literature class. Please not, my review is of the story, not of the writing ability of the author. The story just did not appeal to me at all."

"869",868,"Clara","I hated this book. We had to read it for my freshman American Literature class. I really disliked it. Usually I'm excited to read a classic, but I knew my mother had hated it and we have similar taste. I read it reluctantly. I just never saw the point in the book. I hated every character, didn't care about a single one of them, felt nothing when they died. The story was insignificant. It was just dull, dreamy and stupid."
"870",869,"Tristan Goding","I mean, it's certainly a very divisive novel in the truest sense of the word, and I'm not going to criticize those that love it as there are a lot of you folks out there, but this was one of the most frustrating and sickening books I've ever read. It's far too indulgent and decadent for my tastes (which most folks tell me is the point, so I guess it works), but I also hate this book because it is responsible for the existence of a lot of similarly styled books that continue to be published to this very day."

"872",871,"Chaitalee Ghosalkar","So I was given a fair warning by a friend that finishing this book would be a superhuman task. My experience came close to it.That this book was voted 20th century's best century makes me question myself, but I think I'd rather not take that title too seriously and for multiple reasons.Firstly, the plot gets lost somewhere in the randomness in which the story is presented. For the first quarter, you cannot make heads or tails of it. And when the story finally gets on track, you realize that there is nothing in the offing. The story could've been finished in 1000-2000 words, and save its readers a lot of time.So vague is the prose that after finishing the book, I had to look-up the plot on wikipedia to see if I'g gotten it correctly.Such a waste...I wonder how this book came to be regarded as a literary classic."

"888",887,"Erica","Okay- I'm not trying to offend anyone here, but what a waste of time. I think the writing itself was fantastic, but what kind of story line is that?

"
"900",899,"Keeley","I understand this is a classic and I am sure many people have read it and thought that this book was amazing, but I thought it would never end. The beginning seemed long and drawn out and made no sense until the very end. Then in the end nothing ended like it should. This book seems so pointless. I think that the only good part was the climax and goodness it was quite the climb, then it just sort of ends. It is like Fitzgerald ran out of time and hurried the ending together, and he hardly ever just came out and said anything in the book. Everything was just kind of skipped around and you had to assume for like a few pages until he decided to tell you. I thought this book was utterly awful and if I did not have to read this for school, I would never have read it. Awful. "
"901",900,"Olivia Jensen","I have read this at least three times. Once for pleasure and twice for school. All three times I hated it. The symbolism is too obvious and Daisy (isn't that her name) is over the top indulgent and snooty. None of the characters were likable and that ruined the book for me. Their privledged secret world was ridiculous and nothing in that book appealed to me. It is my number one most hated classic book! "
"902",901,"Jim Razinha","I finally read this after avoiding it for so many years (am 47 now) and couldn't decide which was more amazing: that the book was so unimpressive or that so many people consider it to be their favorite. As a story, it was sorely lacking in anything that could keep my attention; I read it in one day, but had to force myself to finish, if only because I wanted to know what the big deal was. I cannot understand how this is considered to be a literary masterpiece (from the back cover)."
"905",904,"Jay Monahan","Not a fan of Fitzgerald. I know I'm in the minority but I don't think this ever goes anywhere."

"908",907,"Leigh Ann","Ok, decided to get some classics in and read this, it sounded interesting in my daughter's history book. I stuck with it and read the whole thing, but never did quite ""get it"". As far as I can tell it's about a man who nobody really knew, who was miserable and then died and no one attended his funeral...even though everyone attended his big lavish parties every night. Yep, that about summed it up...I must of missed something...curious to see how Leonardo DiCaprio is going to make a whole movie of it next summer. "
"909",908,"Oboudreaux","Two-dimensional, underdeveloped characters and a one-dimensional, underdeveloped plot.

"918",917,"Paulina Agyei","This was well written but I could not connect to it, and I did not really like it. Other then the fact that our fantasies can never compete with out realties, I didn't like any other point in the book. Also what was up with that scene where Nick slept with that photographer? It really was not relevant to the story, or was it? I am not mad it was in there, I was just confused of its relevance.."
"919",918,"Laurie","It was awful and boring and I only completed it because I was required to by my college literature professor!"
"920",919,"J'aime","Boring. There is no other way for me to describe this book. I think it was books like this (and Catcher in the Rye, and Grapes of Wrath, etc.) that made me hate and resent the ""classics"" so much. Especially since I HAD to read them. For my personal reading, if I don't like the book it gets tossed aside. Yet, so much of my high school reading was taken up by books that sucked. I couldn't find anything classical about this. Self-indulgent people, with more money than brains, doing nothing. Blah."
"921",920,"Sami","Why is this considered a classic?"
"922",921,"Drew Van gorder","The Great Gatsby was incredibly uninteresting and altogether bland from beginning to end. Many consider it to be the greatest American novel of all time, yet it lacked the flare that a fiction written during the roaring twenties would be expected to have. The characters were parochial, disjointed, and only marginally developed. The Great Gatsby was not that great. It should have stayed in the twenties, never to emerge again."

"932",931,"Martsky","Hmmmm ... what can i say. it was nicely written, but i completely can't imagine how you can make this into a blockbuster Hollywood movie. and why anyone would like to do this. its rather a nice short story. not just because it is short, but it has all the typical characteristics of a short story. so don't expect a novel, with a beginning, a middle and an end, and you will like it."
"933",932,"G.T. Almasi","I know this is heresy, but I hate this book. It's like reading about a bunch of gold-plated trash cans clanging into each other. I think it's a dated, ponderous hulk about a bunch of dilettante losers trying to find the most dramatically efficient way to waste their empty, over-privileged lives. Plus, it commits the one cardinal sin of pop-entertainment: it's really boring. "

"940",939,"Bad","I despised this novel. The time period really didn't help either. I was required to read this novel in 11th grade lit. about 4 1/2 years ago. I only give it one star because a woman was run over by a car unexpectedly, and for some reason it was incredibly humorous. The 20's really holds no inspiration for me though, so I give this novel two thumbs way down. But it's more to personal taste that my thumbs apply. I do think that it was well written, and would be perfectly enjoyable to someone with a taste for such characters and setting."

"942",941,"Rachelle (Rachelle's Reading)","To be perfectly honest, I hated reading this book with an intense passion, that had previously only been directed at Stephanie Meyer's 'Twilight' series.I have found, on further reflection, that the cause of this hatred is similar in both of the titles. A silly young female protagonist who can't make up her godforsaken mind about which man will complete her life. This mindset frustrates me to no end; I find it absolutely horrifying that this book is inflicted on our youth and tooted as an example of exemplary writing. For me, for the age in time that is personified as the most decedent and lavish, the descriptions continuously fell flat. I never felt as if I was part of the story, with the dress swirling around my knees, the complementary tinkle of the glasses with music in my ears or the smell of the perfume from myself and the other ladies teasing my nose. This in particular deeply disappointed me, as I had been lead to believe this was one of the greatest books ever written. Scene changes and dialogue came across as choppy and forced, constantly jarring me from my reading flow.Overall I found this book to be lackluster and unsatisfying."
"943",942,"Bexi","I didn't get it. I could never grasp Fitzgerald's rhythm and think this attributed to me being completely unattached to the story. But, from what I could figure out, the story wasn't interesting to me. Maybe I'll read it again...but for now, it just seems like a boring, confusing story. "

"948",947,"Kim ","I know this is supposed to be a 'classic'. However, the subject matter was disappointing to say the least. I didn't really appreciate or like or identify with any of the characters. I wouldn't recommend this book. The only thing I liked was that it was short and over fairly quickly."
"949",948,"Alexander Adamson","I did not like it. I read it in my English class in high school. I may not have liked it because I was forced to read it. I need to read it again because I am having a hard time even knowing what the story is even about."

"959",958,"Desiree","I just... didn't like it. Aside from the fact that it's short, it's very... disjointed. Several times in the book there are sentences that don't actually fit with the paragraph they're in and I found myself re-reading the page to see if I was just crazy. After I finished it I felt like maybe I should read it again, because surely I missed something. I mean, it's a classic. Surely there's something else there? I haven't re-read it yet though, still undecided if I will because for such a short book it took me a week to read it the first time because I just really didn't enjoy it."
"960",959,"Lady Darcie Guenon","i read this in my english class...it was pretty lame but yet again pretty interesting. It got all the main points of what was going down in the 1920's and it sorta reminded me of romeo and juliet cause they guy wants the girl but shes taken and then the whole tragic stuff goes down."

"963",962,"Theresa Chapman","Bored my brains out in high school!"
"964",963,"Bryce","This book is one of those readings that are typically required by high school English teachers, i.e. very bad. It provides a few interesting insights into the roaring twenties, but no real value that I can think of. If you're not required to read it, then don't."

"966",965,"Nina","Read for school which explains the poor rating"

"969",968,"Rebekah","I had a hard time getting into this book. I had to read it in 10th grade for school. I have always thought about trying to reread it on my own thinking that because I had to read it for school I hated it. Maybe I will get to it in the future."

"977",976,"Brandie","The Great Gatsby was a waste of time. I either missed the point of the whole book or one just doesn't exist."
"979",978,"Emma Louise","What is all the fuss about? I don't know. Honestly I can't see how it can be labelled as one of the best books ever written because it was so boring. Okay it wasn't ALL boring. The chapters seemed to alternate between boring and interesting, but I skimmed the last 50 or so pages to find that nothing really interesting happened. I have a weird relationship with these so called classic novels. I don't seem to like any of them very much, nor do I understand what they are about in the end. "
"980",979,"Sunny","I regret giving this guy any more attention than he deserves. "
"981",980,"Zain Haider","Lame; his writing tries to run with crutches on, it is very unpleasant to watch as you turn the pages.Probably my least favourite novel of all time. "
"983",982,"Jake Deaven","Rich people doing rich people things. Approaches something similar to watching Bravo in the 1920s, except it's riddled with symbolism that begs to be interpreted and accepted as intellectual. Unforgivable!"
"984",983,"Chris Raimo","Bad. Very Bad. Lethargic and aimless. What was he point? The only decent character was Tom B. His boisterous nonsense made me laugh. Everyone else was death on two legs. The most worthless people ever. Daisy is hands down the most loathsome female character of all time and I say female because Gatsby take ls the overall crown. All she did throughout the entire story was complain about how hot it was and whisper weird nonsense into people's ears. I wanted Nick to strangle her right in front of everyone! The worst. The absolute worst. And Fitzgerald from a structural point of view didn't follow one single guideline in how to plot a book and it shows. I want my money back from the Fitzgerald estate like now."
"986",985,"Anne Kiwi","I hated this book. I disliked Daisy from the moment I began to read it. I couldn't sympathize with Gatsby at all. He seemed like a crazy stalker to me. It was one of those ""all kids in high school must read"" books, so I read it for class, but have to say I would never make anyone read it again. I think it was well written, in that the language was descriptive and clear. But I also think it is one of those trendy books that everyone has to read because everyone else has had to read it. Some form of common high school suffering we must all endure. I think there are TONS of better books out there that high schools could be requiring of their students instead of inflicting this drivel on them."
"987",986,"Malin","Normally, 177 pages would be a breeze, especially considering that the period in which I read them included a weekend. The Great Gatsby, however was quite a slog, and the only reason I finished it at all was stubbornness and that fact that I refused to let a novel of less than 200 pages beat me. The plot is narrated by Nick Carraway, whose settled in the East (Long Island, working in New York) to make money from bonds. The book is set in 1922, and Carraway narrates the story of his distant cousin Daisy Buchanan, her oafish husband Tom, his mysterious neighbour Jay Gatsby, and the rather complicated connections between them. The majority of the characters in the book are unfaithful, and absolutely everyone in it are deeply dislikable. This is the main reason I had such a hard time getting through the book, despite its relative shortness. Carraway is smug and self satisfied, Tom Buchanan is a brute and a fascist, Daisy is a cold-hearted and narcissistic ninny and Jay Gatsby is pitiful and pathetic, hoping to buy both friendship and love. My husband claims that I just don't get why the book is great, and that Fitzgerald brilliantly captures a period in time with precision and excellent language. That I can't appreciate art for its own sake. When it comes to books, I simply cannot enjoy a book, no matter how beautifully written, if I can't engage with a single character in it. It's the reason I hate greatly acclaimed novels like Wuthering Heights, Atonement, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, and now, The Great Gatsby."
"988",987,"Yuckamashe","I know everyone loves this book. I do not. It could be because it was High school required reading. However, so was Mockingbird and Weathering Heights and I loved them. I wanted to love this book. I love the stories about Fitzgerald and Zelda's personal life. I was bored out of my mind.It's hard to get behind a lead female character when they are so unlikeable."
"989",988,"Rodolfo Pardi","never been able to finish it"
"990",989,"JackieB","This left me cold. I'm not sure why but I just could not empathise with any of the characters. I didn't dislike them but I was indifferent to them."

"994",993,"☼~Marian~☼","Why did I read this book? Its a classic. It is also included in 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die. I heard a lot of ravings and I got curious.It started slow. Eventually picked up its pace after meeting Gatsby. The novel is surprisingly ordinary for me. I guess I was expecting something more. I didn't like Nick Carraway's narration. It made things detached & lousy. Plus points for Daisy, the character I despised. I was bored. I'm sorry. This is just not my cup of tea."
"996",995,"Sarah Munir Jumah","I couldnt finish it!! It was so boring and senseless. I was literally pushing myself to read it. I guess I ll just watch the movie now after I have delayed it thinking the book would be better."

"999",998,"Allyson","All I can say is that I was very disappointed. I really wanted to like this book -- 'everyone"" loves it and the story appealed to me, but I guess F. Scott Fitzgerald's style is just not for me."
"1000",999,"Hannah","I just... ooch, I couldn't get into it."
"1001",1000,"Virginia","I read this in High School English and hated it! I don't usually like tragedy or drama, but I especially disliked reading the gory detail following the pedestrian auto accident. The twisted morality of the plot and petty motivations of the characters drove me nuts. Then having to watch the movie after-wards just made me hate it more. F. Scott Fitzgerald is not my favorite author. I found nothing uplifting in this book."
"1002",1001,"Julie Langdon","This book... Hmmmmm how do I describe this? I thought it was so boring.. Looking back on it, I can see that I kinda like the story, but not as it was written. Maybe it was just too old, I don't know.. But I had to force myself through it.. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie to see how they filled in the parts that were so vague in the book."
"1003",1002,"Flippinggoat","This has to be one of the stupidest books I have ever been forced to read. Ever."
"1005",1004,"hiilovemarkhoppus","the 5 minutes I heard were reaalllllyyyy boring.the narration was good. the voice was kind of weird though...it kept like coughing and hacking and stuff. creepy."
"1006",1005,"MelancholyDragon","I had to add this book, only to state how much I hated it. Everything about it...even the movie was stupid."
"1007",1006,"Someoneyouknow","One of the most boring classic books I've read (nothing beats ""Anna Karenina"" and ""War and peace"" though!). The only redeemable thing about this book is that it's shorter than 200 pages. I think Fitzgerald made a big mistake when he wrote the story from the ""outsider's"" point of view. If the narrator of the story was Gatsby, I think it would have been a better book. Wouldn't it be more interesting to watch Gatsby go through all these stages of his life, see the life from his perspective, ""hear"" his thoughts and feelings towards Daisy? Instead we get a dry retelling of his life story, an insipid main character who glimpses bits of everyone else's life, and a story that despite being fairly short, manages to move forward at a snail's pace! The characters, other than Gatsby who seemed somewhat interesting, are extremely unlikable : a disagreeable husband cheating on his wife, who becomes jealous when she thinks of leaving him, a wife, upset by his behaviour, but unable to leave him because of her passivity and undecisiveness, who threw away her chance of happiness with the old lover by sticking with the man she's used to, the idiot Wilson who didn't realize that his wife was cheating on him and others.Overall, I get the feeling that the author wanted to show us that ""sometimes life breaks in mysterious ways"" and everything may fall apart when we least expect it to, and I agree with this concept, but the execution of it was horrible!"
"1009",1008,"M","Huh, for some reason I just wasn't able to get into the this book"
"1011",1010,"Deidr'e Durbin","I absolutely hated this book. The main female character is a nitwit and there is no romance! I don't see why people say this is romantic. The entire thing is one big con job. "

"1014",1013,"Janet","I read this book because it was a classic but I was really disappointed in the story."
"1015",1014,"The Wandering Bibliophile ","Easily the dullest and most plotless book I've ever read in my life. Absolutely nothing made me care one bit about any of the characters. It almost doesn't matter what I read the rest of the year; THIS will be the worst of 2013 without a doubt. "
"1016",1015,"Vicky Thomasson","I was highly disappointed with this book. It was dull, unexciting and if I'm honest, boring in places. I couldn't relate to any of the characters and I found the love stories passionless. The only thing I liked about it was that it wasn't a very long book."
"1017",1016,"Gabrielle","So... Gatsby loves Daisy. Daisy is married to Tom. Tom is having an affair with Myrtle. Then Daisy and Gatsby have an affair. But when Gatsby tries to get Daisy to leave Tom, she leaves the man who loves her instead to go back to... the man who's cheating on her. Why? Because Tom has social status. Then Daisy runs over Myrtle and Gatsby takes the blame. Myrtle's husband George shoots Gatsby and then commits suicide. So basically, half the cast is dead and the other half doesn't care. WHY is this such a good book? It's main theme is that no matter how hard you try you will never achieve your dreams. Sounds like the PERFECT thing to be teaching teenagers right before they graduate of course."
"1018",1017,"Lola","Sorry but I really don't get it...I know this book is a huge classic and all but I found it slow and boring. It' took me about four chapters to start getting the point of the story and even then I had to start all over again because I really couldn´t connect with neither the story nor the characters.I wouldn't recomend it to anyone. "
"1020",1019,"Riannon","Some people think this book is great, but I never saw the attraction. To me it just comes off as a book about a bunch of miserable people leading miserable lives. I couldn't find it in my heart to care about what happened to any of them."
"1021",1020,"Dennis Comeaux","I have read pornography that was more interesting than this. What a terrible, terrible book. The only reason its heralded as literary is because unless you try to pick apart juxtaposition and ""why was there a GREEN light at the end of the pier?"" then the book falls apart as a linguistic experiment. Cosmopolitan magazine is better written and has more literary quality."
"1022",1021,"Matt Kammeyer","The story of a loser, written by a loser. ""Write what you know..."""

"1024",1023,"Lilly","Why is this a ""classic""?? Not only was it terrible, the story made absolutely no sense! A story about a bunch of rich snobby people having affairs and doing random crap everyday was not a ""classic"" book to read. Not only did the story have no clear meaning or actual story line, the characters were just idiots. All I can say is simply craptastic!"
"1026",1025,"Kathy","The story, the characters, I just didn't like any of it. And I read this book TWICE. I read some reviews on here that it is a small depiction of the ""Jazz Age"" and if that's the case then I can't say I particularly care about reading anything else about this time period. The shallowness and superficiality had me grinding my teeth and when I finally finished I felt as if I had almost wasted some hours of my life that I will never get back. Now, I saw ""almost"" because while I did not like the story, I liked the writing. Though what was being written irked me, I couldn't help but admire Fitzgerald's use of words and almost (shall I say musical? silky? I don't know, something smooth...) way he wrote this book. Despite that however, it still gets one star. I plan MAYBE to get another book, The Beautiful and the Damned, a chance to see if it's just like this book, but so far it's a very, very, minute ""maybe""."
"1027",1026,"Mary Jane","I read this book in High School for English and I thought it was SO boring. I didn't get anything out of it. I don't know why it is a classic. Someone help me!"
"1028",1027,"Cecil Paddywagon","I'm not going to give this book a rating because it's a ninety-year-old artifact [Nah, I decided to go ahead and rate it, why not].I did not like the book. I didn't like the writing. I didn't like much of anything about it. When I read old novels, I generally try to keep an open mind about conventions I normally disdain; to read otherwise would be like scorning the crudeness of early Mesopotamian figurative sculpture. Gotta take it for when it was produced, man. Can't hate on Fritz Lang's Metropolis for its sound quality. Etc.Eh. I made my effort here. Another notch off the Old Dead White Men to-read list."
"1030",1029,"Nick Sologoub","What a horribly boring book. And they are shooting a film based on it! I hope the screenwriter is a good professional, I don't know how can you make an interesting film out of this book.I guess I am not cut for serious reading."
"1032",1031,"Smorris","I remember when this book was assigned in high school. I was really excited to read it. I was expecting an awesome story worthy of its fame. I was deeply disappointed. Gatsby turned out not to be so great. This story of this book seemed like a soap opera. Gatsby loved Daisy who was married. Everyone seemed to be just running around. There were so many characters, many of whom I thought were inconsequential. I wanted Gatsby to be great, but he was a regular person. Even after studying all of the syntax, diction, or symbolism I still do not like the book. "
"1033",1032,"Matthew Vincent ","I...Hate this book."
"1034",1033,"Crystal","Wow, did I hate reading this book. I can't say for sure whether I was more annoyed by the weak and whiny characters, or the slightly-too-vague ending.A Shakespearian ending (a la Hamlet) would really improve my liking for this book."
"1035",1034,"Janice","I was a little surprised by how much I disliked this book, since it is always so highly recommended. I was disappointed how not a single character seemed to poses any degree of a moral compass. At first I thought that Nick would somehow end up as the hero of this story, but at the end I was upset he could have no better influence on his friends. I felt like I kept waiting for the story to be interesting, to have some point or some small pearl of knowledge, but it was truly a disappointment to me. "
"1036",1035,"Margot","Required reading in school. I don't remember it well, perhaps it needs another read."
"1037",1036,"Jayse","I watched both the 1974 film and the 2013 film. The older one had a splendid vintage feel. The 2013 version was so amazing , breath taking, charming, extravagant, rich and thick with captivating interest. So when it came time to read the novel that both the films were based on I was so excited. But after reading it was a 100% let down. I'm happy that the book became a 2013 film though because it was truly amazing. I am sad though that the book was a disappointment. Movie > Book "

"1042",1041,"Adrienne","Terriby boring, tedious, no plot,poorly written"
"1043",1042,"Edd Vanterpool","At the beginning of this book, I thought it was going to be an impressive book. While reading the first couple of chapters, I was baffled. I had to request for help from my friends who did understood it. I do not like this book and I probably will not give a good opinion about it. However I do know what the great Gatsby is about. I know about the beginning the middle and end. I didn’t like this book but it represented the American Dream. Jay Gatsby has his American Dream. He was rich and famous. Jay Gatsby’s neighbor, Nick Carraway, is the narrator. He is important because he is daisy’s cousin. There are a lot of affairs: Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, Nick Carraway and Jordan Baker. In the end he was going to the hospital because Daisy became pregnant from Tom. Gatsby went back home with Daisy. Daisy drove the car. While driving she hit Myrtle. Myrtle’s husband, who was furious, killed Gatsby and himself. Then at the funeral there were not a lot of people. His father and Nick were there. "
"1046",1045,"Joel Brown","Wow...definitely not THE great American novel. I am a glutten for punishment and have read this book three times hoping to see in it what so many others blather over. I see a poorly concieved story filled with characters who Fitzgerald tried to make whole, but all I read are husks of humanity acting as drones. Maybe that was a bit sharp, but you get the idea. I didn't like...maybe I'll read it again in a decade or so."

"1055",1054,"Isabella","I was really excited to read this book when we were assigned to it in my Literature class. However, my excitement soon diminished when I started reading it. Honestly, this is one of the worst books I have read. The plot is dry, and you can't connect to any of the characters. Each character has very few positive qualities, and you find yourself getting very frustrated with each of them. The conclusion is terrible, and I don't know why it is a classic."

"1061",1060,"Safa ","Maybe I hate this book so much because my English teacher made us annotate every chapter (she literally gave us huge packets to annotate for homework) or maybe I just hate it because the writing was pretentious and the characters didn't even seem like real people.

"1068",1067,"Kelly Renée","You know a book is bad when you're glad the main character dies. One of the worst books I've read. I felt like there wasn't much of a plot, and Fitzgerald took up five pages just to describe the dirt the character was standing on. To understand what's happening in the book, you really need to focus hard otherwise nothing makes sense. Not to mention the characters are all really impassive and seem to be lying and keeping secrets. I just couldn't relate to them and bring myself to like any of them. The narrator was as dull as a doornail and didn't have his own opinions. The Great Gatsby is a terrible book that doesn't surprise me as to why it never had good sales in the first place."
"1069",1068,"Booklover","I did not enjoy reading this book. Having no interest in the roaring twenties or prohibition it was all I could do to finish reading this and I wouldn't have if it was not required. Yuck!"
"1071",1070,"Timothy Olson","Didn't enjoy it."
"1072",1071,"AlixNicolee","Perhaps my reasoning for only giving this book one star was that I really didn't like it. Perhaps because the novel was so strangely written, and I, creative when needing to be pragmatic and suddenly very literal when needing to understand things for more than their surface traits, still am unable to comprehend the title of the book: The Great Gatsby. In my opinion, the man wasn't really great at all. Where my English class was sad, I was happy; where they liked the Great one, I liked Nick. I hadn't started the book with high expectations, so I lost nothing in reading this, save a week and a half."
"1073",1072,"Brent Strandy","I do not understand how this book became a classic. Maybe at the time this book was written (1925) the story and character development were phenomenal. I’m convinced that if this story were written today it would be scoffed, shamed and forgotten. At first, this book feels disjointed and without purpose. As the book comes to a close a stronger sense of plot and purpose emerge. There are also times when characters interact in awkward ways. When two characters interact the author assumes the reader can induce certain aspects of the conversation when in fact a more in-depth description of the situation is needed. Ultimately, the book is boring, archaic, awkward and difficult to enjoy. How in the world did this book survive the testament of time?"
"1076",1075,"Rillanon","I read this book because I was working on the film doing some of the visual effects. What a boring book. It feels like nothing happens and by the time I reached to end I was sick to death of the saying ""Old Sport"""
"1077",1076,"Macy","What did I think? I had to read this book for Lit class. Hated it. Every character in this book is stupid, except for Nick. Why is it that Tom could have flings but the moment Daisy expressed interest in someone he suddenly cared? I found it really sad that Nick was potentially Gatsby's only friend. Would not recommend. "

It was a confusing read and a difficult to understand one. In the end I had to read a review to fully understand it.

While the ""american dream"" seems indeed elusive."

I'm rather surprised that the high school is allowing these students to read this book when it is filled with infidelity, lies, corruption and greed."
"1092",1091,"Allie","I know this book is a classic and all, but I read it in a liturature class and neither liked it nor understood it.

"1137",1136,"Madeleine","In The Great Gatsby, readers get an insight into the lives of West Egg, New York residents during the roaring twenties, particularly the idealist Jay Gatsby. Gatsby tries to catch his love Daisy Buchanan, even though she's already married and in love. Even though Gatsby throws luxurious, lively parties and charms Daisy, he does not succeed in his attempt to have Daisy to himself.I've read this book many a time in the past 6 or so years, just trying to get into it. I love the Jazz Age, but this book just doesn't do it for me. I get annoyed by Gatsby's idealistic ways. I also get more and more annoyed by Daisy. I just don't like her, and cannot really put a finger on exactly why. I really wish I could like this book, as the 1920s is one of my favorite time periods of American history, but I dislike it the more I read it. "

"1145",1144,"Andy","The Great Gatsby, The great American novel, turned out to be not so great. Taking the reader and giving them a pair of eyes through Nick Carraway as they delve into the lavish lifestyle of the upper class during America's roaring twenties. While Gatsby is treated as almost something to be worshiped, I felt that that level of attention and craft never really made it onto the other characters leaving them for the most part, flat and uninteresting. The parties, meant to show just how wild the people could be, never really pulled me into this world of greed and selfishness in the same way Gatsby's plan did. While Gatsby may have been great, I feel the rest of the story was mediocre in comparison."

So I had to read it again in college and thought, I should really keep an open mind this time. I tried. I still hated it. And I would just like to say- I love to read more than I love to do anything in the world, and it is a very rare occasion for me to hate a book."
"1148",1147,"Gregory Taresh","Yawn...."

"1150",1149,"Marisa Hamblin","I really didn't like this book. It was well written, that's for sure. That's why it got one star... But other than that I didn't like it. It didn't teach good values, there wasn't a great plot, the experiences the characters went through were unnecessary. It just wasn't a really good book to me. "
"1152",1151,"Christina Davis","I read it as a high school assignment. Although it is very well written, I just can't stand a book about someone having an affair, (or wishing they were). The one thing I got from it at the time was a realization that I thought different than my peers, as they all thought she should have an affair because her husband had been cheating on her all those years. That is not justification in my book, even more so now than back then."
"1153",1152,"Shantelle","I read The Great Gatsby because it was required in a college class I did. I don't see how anyone could enjoy such a book. For one, the people had awful livestyles, drinking and partying, and such. Marriage was smashed in The Great Gatsby... it seems every husband had a mistress, and the wives (at least Daisy) held to a long-lost love instead of honoring the husband whom she pledged herself to for life. The Great Gatsby was gruesome, and it ended in darkness and bloodshed. Mr. Gatsby was dead, and Daisy probably went crazy with guilt and grief. It made me sick. The only thing I can say for this novel is that it shows how truly hopeless and hurtful people we can be without the all-surpassing and all-changing love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ.I don't think I would recommend this book to anyone. It left me feeling sick inside, and mourning for the characters. Please realize I'm not trying to sound self-righteous... I know that it would be easy to make the same mistakes the characters in The Great Gatsby did. It just makes me so sad to see people live such hopeless and empty lives... not realizing that doing things God's way will bring much, much greater results, and joy!! The Great Gatsby was interesting, but, in the end, a great disappointment to me."
"1154",1153,"Bill","Not a big fan of the book. I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen. Nothing happened. It reads like a diary."
"1155",1154,"Andreas Ragen","The characters did not impress, and neither did the setting.That a man can live with only one goal, and that to get a particular woman is hard to believe in itsself. That a woman can be so dense and still have tens upon tens of successful men after her is even harder to believe.Lastly the extravagance of the parties thrown is simply insane."
"1156",1155,"Kevin Douglas","What an over rated bore fest. The longest and most tedious short novel I have ever read. Actually , I changed my mind...no stars."
"1158",1157,"Sarah Goodwin","This novel was on my list of important books to read to improve my understanding of books as a whole.It's not now.I read the book, it was alright, I got through it, though I had to struggle. The protagonist was boring, the sense of place unclear, and I found all the characters to be woefully dull. I got the point of it, it had some interesting moments, but perhaps would have appealed to me more as a six page short story, a length that might have suited the amount of interesting material better.I won't be reading the book again, and it has seriously put me off reading anything else by the author, so I'm moving on to something else.I can see that a few reviewers have gotten some nasty comments because they don't like this book. But, I'm reviewing anyway, and would like to say two more things.1. Don't bother flaming me, this book isn't worth it.2. I don't read comments, so, if you really want to waste more words on this novel than have already been wasted here, have at it. "

"1161",1160,"Catherine","To be quite frank, I have always felt that The Great Gatsby is nothing more than a glorified short story. I fail to understand why this book continues to be admired and cherished by people to this day. I encourage you to seek out truly remarkable, inspiring, beautifully written literature worthy of being considered one of the best books of the 20th century elsewhere because The Great Gatsby is no such thing."
"1162",1161,"Lion","I was having high expectations from F. Scott fitzgerald. he has disappointed me badly! I find it highly boring. I tried to complete anyhow. it took me 4 months still I finished half only!you better watch himmatvaala movie than reading this book!"

"1169",1168,"Eli","So dull. I'm actually not really sure what was happening. An affair? Or several affairs? A counter-affair maybe? I'll watch the film. I've heard that if you study it before you actually read it. It becomes easier to read... But not a great light read. I recommend it if you're very good at literature analysis or have an English degree. If you read just to get lost in another world; this worlds a little to boring for a straight forward reader like me."

"1172",1171,"Paige","I didn't like this book at all. All of the characters with the execption of nick, were unwholesome, crude, and oblivious. There was no discernable plot. Nick, even though he was the narrorator, was the most undefined character of the book. What was that thing between himself and jordan? I really couldn't even tell if anything was going on! Not recommended."

"1176",1175,"Tara Lynn","I keep re-reading this every few years, hoping it's going to be as good as everyone keeps saying it is, and to this day, I still don't get it. I find Gatsby himself to be one of the most annoying characters I've met in contemporary fiction. "
"1177",1176,"Nadine","To be honest, I don't understand why everyone loves this. Why is this a classic? Didn't like it. It was boring. Lost interest after the first half, read the rest of the summary on Wikipedia, decided not to finish it."

"1184",1183,"Jake Ratliff","When it comes to The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald I am neither impressed nor entertained. When reading through the story I found myself becoming more and more annoyed just due to the fake personalities throughout the American upper classmen in the story and the overwhelming amount of duality in the case of the Buchannan family. It’s not so much that fact that this is included in the story, but rather that it is what the whole story revolves around. Had the story been based more around the criminal acts and organizations that gained Gatsby his wealth, which was the plot twist that added the only bit of flavor to the story, then perhaps the story would have been a more interesting read and thus justified the title of the book. However, the author decided to spend half the book on Mr. Carraway and his personal life and Tom Buchannan and his affair with the fat wife of a gas station owner. That brings me back to the duality of the Buchannans. In Tom’s case it is the fact that he has this affair with the gas station owner’s wife and yet still claims to love Daisy, and in Daisy’s case it’s being set on leaving with Gatsby one minute and being under Tom’s thumb the next. In the end, this book only told me of the duality and artificiality that seems all too common among the New York upper classmen whose only purpose is to impress people they hate and attend the parties of a criminal."
"1185",1184,"Neetpeek","In my opinion, I thought it would be an interesting book but after three chapters I was like ""this it kinda boring"".

I guess if you are a person who really cares about social class and where you ""fit"", maybe it strikes some deep chord within you and you relate to the main character.

In the present being mysterious is some times considered the trait of an outcast. Considering I didn't live back then I don't know if being mysterious was accepted or not. What I do know is that back then it was pretty rude to butt into other peoples business. I cant quite tell if Jay is great or not because not enough evidence is given to me. Could the title be true? Is the title ironic? Well I guess we can say its all a mystery. ;)Thank you for reading my review and have a wonderful day."

"1207",1206,"Cormac Sookram","This is a book for high schoolers, I some how missed it at that time and decided to read it now after seeing the movie trailer. Short read, I have to say I disliked it and the characters in it from the very beginning, even before our plot device, Mr. Gatsby, appears. My supposition is that the book really has nothing to do with Mr. Gatsby. He is a made up magical character that doesn't really exist in real life. The real people in this book are Tom, Daisy, and Jordan Baker. By real, I mean these are the people F. Scott would like us to relate to and use to set as an example. Specifically the author sets them as a poor example. These are the dregs of society, the worst you could associate with, and thus I questioned from the beginning what exactly our narrator was doing associating with them. I expected more from him, as I thought he was a real person, but quite surprisingly he is not. Our narrator is simply a narrator, he might as well not even be in the scene, our little wall flower. This is where the book falls flat, and what real character development can you really do in a 150 pages? Not much as we see here. So, if you're a high school student and want to read a book on why you shouldn't be a horrible person, then read this. I don't really see another other worthwhile points in this book. "

"1211",1210,"J.D.","This was required reading in my high school -- twice, because schools merged and teachers came in from elsewhere, unaware that we'd already read it. I found it painfully boring, both times. Perhaps this was the point -- to show how meaningless and inconsequential such a lifestyle is. Yet, even if this is the point, it certainly didn't make it more enjoyable to read. I certainly don't discount that others found this enjoyable -- and I'm glad if they did. It just wasn't enjoyable for me personally."

I was very disappointed, it never got better I despised all the characters, and the descriptions by the author must have been over my head because I couldn’t get the images of the surroundings. So I went for the Robert Redford movie take on this book to help me get to why this is such a literary classic, but concluded that I still hate it and all the people in it. "

It IS supposed to be a great American classic, so I decided to give it a shot.I can't see how or why anyone could enjoy this book. The writing is okay, but Fitzgerald doesn't sweep me up into his world. Frances Mayes has me walking beside her in Italy after a paragraph from a randomly selected page in her books. Fitzgerald has me wondering if one of the movies is available on Netflix.If I had to sum up the book, I would not say it was any sort of social commentary on life in America or the 20s, except perhaps in the smallest pockets of places far removed from real life. I would say it's just a story about a bunch of rich people screwing around. After three and a half chapters (which is almost half the book), I tried watching the Robert Redford movie on Netflix. I couldn't finish that, either. I'm sure that at least one of the characters is somehow redeemed or killed in the end, but I just can't force myself to care.

And I still hate it. I've never been a fan of symbolism; sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, and a green light at the end of someone's pier doesn't indicate that Mr. So-and-So has a lust for money or equality or even a particular kid of African-moss-mold. It's just a green light. Maybe they like green, or that's all they had on hand. The characters weren't any that I could connect with on any level, the writing was droll, and with my ADHD, there wasn't ever anything exciting enough to keep me interested.If you enjoy the book, power to you.

He talked about The Great Gatsby as if it were the greatest book ever written, and it may very well be. But when you read a book the way he had us read it -- that is we read one chapter, came to class and had him read it back line for line and explaining why EACH sentance was pure poetry, and why each word was getting him high -- not cool. Not cool at all. You never know how annoying a book is until you disect it line for line."

Additionally, with the ""Gatsby fever"" hitting people up because of a film, and the Downton Abbey 1920's interest, it seemed like a perfectly reasonable time to read this.I am so phenomenally... at a loss as to why this is a classic. My husband has suggested ""it is a book which ought to be studied rather than read"" and I agree - after the first chapter, I have no compelling reason to continue reading this other than ""because people call it a classic"". I'm not captured by any of the characters, intrigued by the setting, curious about what will happen... Haven't even met the eponymous Gatsby, and I rather don't have any desire to. I'm dropping this in the bin with Catcher in the Rye and Don Quixote: lovely to say you've read, but it certainly isn't engaging to me, or intriguing for a worthwhile read. I know writing styles have changed over the years, but... I'm not going to read a book waiting to be captured and dragged into its mystery, its engagement, its story. If I'm willing to put it down because the prose is forgettable and the characters make me wince... I'm not going to read a book I won't enjoy just to say I've read it."

I tried and I tried to care about the story, about the characters, about the book and I failed miserably. The oh-so-congratulated language wasn't that special at all to me, I haven't read other Fitzgerald books but in Gatsby I wasn't impressed. There are writers who truly ARE masters of words and so far I wouldn't put Fitzgerald among them. Not to mention the characters who are boring as hell and completely lifeless as far as I'm concerned. None of them was really developed, they are just puppets of the author, I couldn't see anything beyond what his words said about them. If you take one Dostoevsky who drills into the human mind and compare it to the acclaimed Fitzgerald who just says ""That's how you should see him/her, end of story"", you'd understand what I mean. The story was dull and pointless. Oh noes, dude and his wife are cheating on each other. OH noes, there's a mystery millionaire. OH NOES, he dies. Why should I care? How did this book enrich me? What moral did I draw from it? Well, it didn't at all and I didn't at all. If I wanted to see the superficial games of rich people, I'd just watch Gossip Girl, it's just 40 minutes per episode, not the 3 hours it took me to read ""The Great Gatsby"".

The characters in this book all struggle with materialism. They all put money and material items before everything else. The book was a little confusing becauseof all of the characters and the cheating that goes on. I think all he really wanted out of this book was money and he got that. He became rich. The point he wanted to prove is how people act crazy about money. I think he got that point across. He also wanted to talk about death. He did. I dont have any experiance relating to this book. I dont struggle with materialism, but i do know someone that does, so maybe they would know. I don’t think I would recommend this book. It was very slow and boring. It didn’t start to pick up until around chapter five which is more than half way through the book. There are also a lot of characters in the book so it can get confusing with all of the cheating going on. Personally I hated the book. I hate the way the characters are about money. They are all so rich and don’t appreciate any of it. I hate that kind of behavior."

The shallow characters may be shallow for a reason, but that does not mean that they should seem one-dimensional, unrealistic and like mere marionettes that the author uses to make a point. (Others have done shallow characters MUCH better, just read Tolstoy's ""Anna Karenina"".)I also constantly feel like old Fizzy here really, really wants to be full of meaning and depth and so tries to mimick the greats. And completely fails. The expressions he comes up with seem merely ridiculous and the symbolism so much in your face (or at times non-existent) so as to make it fall flat on its face. He wants too much, tries too hard and loves not to hear himself speak, but to see himself write. Too many pages upon pages of elite, upper class references and descriptions of things that are irrelevant.Not only have I now read the book, I've also seen both movies and read another of his works, the short story ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", all of which bored me to sleep and are extremely low on my list of books and movies. Fun fact: a whole 10% of Goodread-raters of the book only gave it one or two stars. So apparently I am not alone in this!"

"1327",1326,"Janis Gilbert","3.8 of 5 stars 3.80 · rating details · 1,286,300 ratings · 31,213 reviewsIn 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write ""something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned."" That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became The Great Gatsby, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, Gatsby captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. ""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--"" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. ""Her voice is full of money,"" Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose, The Great Gatsby is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem.(less)Paperback, 180 pages"

About a million years ago I saw the Robert Redford movie (I think it was him) but don't remember much about it. Haven't seen the newest installment at all. So, I read the book. After all, the book is always better, right. I did not enjoy this book at all. Yes, F. Scott Fitzgerald has a good turn of a phrase. Some things are very prettily said. However, the story was boring. A little slice of living the over-indulgent life of the 20's with people who were not likable at all. I don't buy the love stories or fascination with any of these people. In this readers opinion, a well-turned phrase does not equal a well well told story. I have no idea why schools recommend this as great literature. "
"1334",1333,"Katy","I just finished The Great Gatsby as it is on my study list for English Literature and I have to say I didn't like it.The book is written from the point of view of Caraway, a character with little back bone an infuriatingly hypocritical nature and is an unreliable narrator that spends the entire novel in confusion. The other character's follow the same hypocrisy and all come across as unpleasant. Fitzgerald overemphasises the lavish nature of society to point out the hedonism of the times. But this is done without subtly and comes across as forced. The book is also too long and often goes off on what appears to be pointless tangents. I will however credit the book for (it's not so hidden) messaging and metaphors that really highlight the philosophy's of the rich in America at the time. "

"1340",1339,"Karen J","This book was assigned for a college literature course. If I had not HAD to read it, I would have quit before I reached the middle."
"1341",1340,"Wendi","I'm a member of a book club with very few limits. Our only limitations are to pick something in paper back so that it is more affordable for everyone, and if it is a series be sure to pick the first. So, The Great Gatsby was chosen. This was a book I was assigned to read while in high school and chose to skip, but I did enjoy the movie with Robert Redford. The book read like one long alcohol induced dream, everything seemed hazy around the edges and disjointed. There was never a transition between topics, and everyone was constantly drunk in a life that was nothing but a 24 hour party. I found not a one of the characters to be likable, all of them were liars and weak. The book could have been told in a short story in only a few pages and would have translated across just fine. From someone who is usually a fan of anything from the 20's era, the only thing I can think to say nice about this book is that it is short and I only had to pay $2 for it."

"1343",1342,"Kim Sasso","Hated this with less passion than I felt about Lolita or The Hobbit, but hated it nonetheless."
"1344",1343,"Jovita","I found it impossible to enjoy this book, I struggled to get through it and found it quite boring. I confess that I did have extremely high expectations especially since The Great Gatsby is considered one of the greatest American novels, a classic masterpiece… I think it’s overrated. I really didn't care about anyone in this book; the characters weren’t memorable as in other classics. I just don’t get… Why is Gatsby so great?! "
"1345",1344,"Wendy","I fail to understand why this is a classic. I hated the characters. They were all morally bankrupt and the story has no redeeming value."

"1350",1349,"David Tenniswood","Didn't enjoy it much. Had to make myself finish it-could easily have put it down! It just seemed slow and boring. Hard to keep all the characters straight and their relationships. I don't understand why this is considered a great novel"
"1351",1350,"Dustyn Frankcom","I was forced to read this book in English class and I had utterly zero interest in the book. The skill Fitzgerald used to write this novel though so I must commend him of that...although I had no interest in the plot"
"1352",1351,"Louanne","When a book is supposedly a ""classic"" and a movie is made out of it then I expect it must be a great book. Well....I just couldn't get into it. So I watched the movie on You Tube and stopped it at about the same place I stopped reading it. Love stories and affairs are not my cup of tea I guess. Boring!"
"1354",1353,"Aubri","Hated this book. Why do people like it? To me it was all about falsehood, infidelity and insincerity. Yuck."

"1357",1356,"Prity Malhotra","This is the WORST book I hv read by far..I don't understand what all this hoopla is all about..Why so much praise for this Book ? The. Character of Gatsby is plain Stupid: On one hand, he is a self made Multi-Millionaire yet he can't even judge people or see through their Skins !! THe Twists in this book are pale even in comparison of Sidney Sheldon or Jeffery Archer's worst written Thrillers..The Author makes it a point to giving sermons about the good & bad people, fame, fortune, love , relationships etc time to time..It almost felt like he is lecturing me on life..The End was too pale..The Author wanted the reader to feel bad abt Gatsby, but I just didn't gave any Fcuk !! Call me Insensitive, but this book just didn't move me , even for a bit !!"
"1358",1357,"Alexis","i would like to take this opportunity to publicly apologize for hating this book. I AM SORRY."
"1361",1360,"Heidi Stewart","I really do not sympathize with Gatsby at all. In fact I find him to be pretty pathetic. And since the narrator RAVES about what a great man he is ... nope. Just nope."
"1362",1361,"Stefanie","Had it read this one five times for different classes. Can't say it got any better either time I tried to re-read it. "

"1366",1365,"Iline","I know it's a ""classic"" but I have to tell you I hated it in hightschool and it has not improved any since."
"1367",1366,"Teija","I have read this book four times and I maintain that the only good thing about this book is chapter 7. I will admit that my judgement of this book is probably colored by the teachers who forced me year after year to nitpick this text and pull all the joy right out of it; the book is technically well-written but it is intensely difficult to connect to the characters, who seem bored with their fabulous, decadent lifestyles. Am I meant to sympathize with these rich people, throwing party after party in fancy clothes with fancy cars? It's alienating just reading about it. "
"1368",1367,"Annastyles","I read this but it must have gone over my head because It did not leave much of an impression on me."
"1369",1368,"Breeana","I wasn't a huge fan of the ending of this book, but it was fairly interesting."
"1370",1369,"Ashleigh","I couldn't make it through it. This book is boring as hell. I've watched the New film and fairly enjoyed it. I mean it was good. Mainly I liked the costumes so bravo Gucci on that. The thing this is meant to be a great, amazing novel. Instead I got about three pages of description on what a guy saw looking out a window (a big house with a big garden) oh the house was eggshell you know so you can really imagine it. I think the book is too detailed and focuses on the little too much. I mean that window? Sure we got a view of Gatsby's house of it, but is it worth 3 pages when we get detail of Gatsby's house in the next few chapters as well? No it wasn't. The plot I like I think it's interesting and good and I understand why this book is classed as great. I hate Daisy. The end. "
"1371",1370,"Shauneen","I was never made to read this at school/ study purposes like many students, so after hearing high praise for it by a few friends I decided to read it. I really wanted to like this book but I found it thoroughly boring and long winded so I stopped at Chapter 6 (which is saying something for such a small book!).Much of the book seemed like unnecessary crap to me and drifted from the point of the story.Not for me I'm afraid."
"1372",1371,"Aili","I have started this book at least four times...my good intentions just can't get me through the whole thing yet."
"1373",1372,"Mike Mercurio","Didn't like the book or the lousy movie. The only good part deals with a billboard that watches the entire mess of a novel unfolding. I wonder what the good doctor would have said, had he the power of speech?"
"1374",1373,"Pat Jourdan","The viewer, Nick Carraway, was like an automatic camera. In fact Isherwood's ""I Am a Camera"" character had far more flesh and blood. After knowing about this book for almost all my life, to read it was a profound disappointment.English/American lit types have built an entire kingdom upon a very slight book of 113 pages. I've probably got the dates wrong, but James Cain and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" sums up the emptiness of those sidelined by the American Dream.One amazing good sign though -page 55, he mentions ""Castle Rackrent"" for which , much is forgiven!"
"1375",1374,"Suresh","shallow story, shallow characters... thankfully a very slim book. in fact that's wat makes it un-putdownable. process goes like: 'you feel like there ought to be something in this highly rated novel.did i miss? ok. let me read carefully...'if this is called an ""an all american novel"", then what is ""the lost symbol""? in one line: the most over rated book ever. ppl who rate this book at the topget a crude satisfaction enticing other unsuspecting people into reading this.(no wonder amway is successful)this has continued successfully, so far. have guts. put a stop to this pseudo-sophistication. this book sucks. period. i didn't lose any self-esteem, see?"

"1383",1382,"Toby Petek","I really did not like this book. It was very hard to read because of the language that the author used when he wrote it.

I don't have much to say on it, as I haven't reread it since High School, but the fact that how much I HATED reading this book stuck with me all these years is not good. NOT good.There is no way for me to put this eloquently so I'll just come right out and say it: This book is boring. It's just terribly boring."

Everyone could've died in that book I hate it grrrrrrrrrrrrerrrrrrr"
"1398",1397,"Josh Gravlee","I found it overrated and boring. Nothing in the book caught my attention or interested me. Also something about the writing style really got on my nerves. It's been several years since I read it, so I don't quite recall what the problem was specifically. It reminded me of a soap opera or something along those lines. "
"1399",1398,"Camila Fernanda","1.5 Estrellas.Quería ponerle 2 estrellas, pero según yo no se las merece. Pero lo terminé, por lo tanto tampoco se merece solo 1 estrella, así que sí... 1.5 estrellas.Fue una tortura leerlo, demasiado fome. Aun que al principio esperé que se pusiera mejor, eso no paso y muchas veces tenia la tentación de dejarlo. No me gusta dejar los libros inconclusos, así que aquí estoy, odiando el libro por que para MI fue un completo aburrimiento."
"1400",1399,"Ryan Adams","I swear that the % of high school students reading books for fun would increase 33.78% if high school teachers would STOP assigning this horrible book! I love to read, and I would quit reading forever if I had to read this book again. I admit that the symbolism is good (The ""eyes"" of the billboard), but I could care less about the rich aristocrats and their problems. In addition, I find F. Scott's writing style to be very boring, slow and I lost interest halfway through the first chapter. There are so many other, better writers and more interesting stories than this one from this time period of literature that High school teachers could choose from. Just because Robert Redford turned this into a movie, doesn't mean anyone should ever be forced to read it."
"1402",1401,"Cheryl","I'm bummed, old sport. This book is not doing a thing for me."
"1403",1402,"Pezquenin","Very few books can claim victory over me, meaning that I almost always finish a book I begin. To be more precise, there is only one I can remember of. It was a book by Carlos Castaneda (luckily for me, I have forgotten the title, blessed be my memory). I borrowed it from the library when I was a teenager in order to practise my english (I'm not a native speaker). I read many pages before I put it down and I returned it to the dusted shelf in the library, from where it should never leave again.I started ""The Great Gatsby"" with great expectations, knowing it is considered one of the 'greatest novels of the twentieth century'. A couple dozen pages into the book and all I could think of was 'what-the-what?'. I was wondering when the good stuff would kick in, because those pages had left a very disappointing taste in me. I was feeling defeated, as with Castaneda's book.I concede Mr. Fitzgerald worked hard on his prose and that his descriptions of events and personalities are not devoid of decoration, but to what purpose? The characters are tremendously dull, especially Nick Carraway, Jordan Baker and Daisy. Well, Daisy is crazy (pun intended). Is Jay Gatsby 'great'? Not in my opinion. He's head over heels in love with Daisy, but the only thing he has to court her is money, upon which he came by chance (and suspicious activities). If I want to read a great novel about love, there are plenty to choose among.There is a long introduction to the book in the copy I have, where Guy Reynolds drones on and on about how this novel embodies the moment of technological change in the time it was written and published. Well, I guess this supports my theory that, had it been written, say, in the seventies, this novel would have passed without much of a whiff.Honestly, I can't understand why this book is so overvalued. It's too much hyped.There are two good things about the book, though:1- It is short, so I didn't waste much of my time reading it. There are so many books to read that I would blame myself if it had taken me longer that it did.2- The copy I got was quite cheap, so I didn't waste too much money on it."
"1404",1403,"Nada","I was hoping not to give it any stars at all. Started reading that book for my American Literature course and it is simply BORING. The book is shown as a representation for the jazz era but I see it as a normal story. there is nothing astonishing about it even my professor was trying to make us like it but he failed miserably. If you like boring books, read this."

"1411",1410,"Juanita Carter","I hated this book and had a hard time finishing. It was beyond boring for me and I can't understand why it is such a ""great American Novel"" when there is so much US fiction that is so much BETTER! I can't believe English teachers force this drab unoriginal book upon their students."
"1412",1411,"Heidi","Made me want to die right there with gatsby. I HATE HATE HATED this book. The entire time i just wanted to backhand daisy."
"1414",1413,"Isaac Timm","I'll give F. Scott Fitzgerald his due; he is an excellent crafter of the language, what he can convey in three words, most writers have a hard time summing up in three paragraphs. What the Great Gatsby lacks is a sense of mystery or narrative propose, it is about crafting nuances rather then weaving a story and I simply enjoy stories more, stories that have a direction or point. To me characters that remain constant and unchangeable are boring, and while many brutal conflicts arise in the Great Gatsby all the characters stay bland and unchanged, some feel guilty, impotent, and retrospective but still go on being unchanged. A wish I could have given this book half a star."
"1415",1414,"Tera Slawson","Hated It!"
"1416",1415,"Jessica Swaim","I've read this book twice and just cannot understand what all the fuss is about. The history teacher in me appreciates the example of 1920's excess, but beyond that, I can't find much to like about this book. The characters are not likable and the ending leaves me feeling depressed."
"1418",1417,"Waad","If you think this book is a great work of literature, you do not think highly of literature. "
"1419",1418,"Melinda","Reading this for the 3rd time but for the first time with a 44 year old mind, I am happy to admit I didn't like the story. Maybe this is a rebellion to all those teachers that told me I had to like Gatsby. To acknowledge it as the great American novel. Why do our schools make kids read it? Guess that's why teacher's have to help them muddle through. University, yes. English majors, yes. I challenge all the kids of the 70s and 80s to re-read this novel and compare it to their first reading. However, I found the book pretenious and overtly bourgeoise. I would have liked James Gatz much more than Jay Gatsby. "
"1422",1421,"Frances Davidson","I was extremely disappointed after reading this book. I expected the ""masterpiece"" that it recieved credit for being, but was immediately disappointed by it's lack of content and finality of the story. I am still pondering how some books manage to recieve the outstanding credit that they do, this book included. "
"1423",1422,"Genevieve","just awful. the most dragged out, boring, pretentious book ive ever read"
"1425",1424,"Jijo Varghese","Is this is the book that everyone exalts as a classic?One of the worst novel I have ever read, I am going to put it in a group of books that I think, Why the hell I read this?.Everyone says its concerns real life, then Is that real life to be in a party,gathered with people of previous night intoxication, and being in a oblivion that this is what is called life? For suffering Fitzgerald shows Gatsby whose lost his love, for a stupid girl Daisy who married a rich man when he was away!.Is that is love???And the narrator Nick, who have not done anything significant in life..and the stupid Gatsby, who built up a house near his lover, who is already married, a waits for his turn to meet her and arranging parties to meet her! Is that is not blood boiling? HOLY SHIT...why I have spent my money for buying this, and one day for reading it?I will give only 1 star and it deserves only that, because am little generous in giving STARS."
"1426",1425,"Kristina Underwood","I read it in HS and didn't like it. Reading it as an adult only reinforced how terrible this book is. "
"1427",1426,"Anna Slaughter","To be honest, I was not fond of this book. I wanted so badly to enjoy it, but between the awkward writing style (in my opinion) and the shallow (intentionally so, I felt) characters who could never quite be trusted anywhere near as far as the book itself might have been thrown, I was unable to find it any real merit. I intend to find some articles and such to see what it is I must have missed, because I feel that it could not possibly be so beloved by so many as a work of classic literature if it was really as awful as I feel it was. I somehow managed to miss having to read it in high school. My English teachers never required it of me, as we were off reading other things. However, I remember many other students walking around with it and talking about what a great book it was. I was aware only of the plot being the story of a man who had risen to greatness only to fall from grace by the end of the book. When the film was released this year, and everyone was raving about it, I decided it was time to go ahead and read the book before I watched it for myself. To be entirely honest, I'm not so sure I'm even going to bother with the film, but perhaps it will bring to light something I missed. Also, Nick is a spineless little worm, who could have prevented a lot of heartache and drama if he would only stop hiding in the shadows of every single other flimsy character. "
"1428",1427,"Jacob","The book is billed as a classic, but like many pieces of Literature, it seems to rest on its laurels. There is not really a driving plot to it. Several chapters are expended explaing the situation, then the main events are gone in a flash. If you have it assigned to you, just deal with it. For leisure reading however, I strongly advise against picking this book."
"1429",1428,"Osanna"," There are plenty of books out there in the world to read. And as a student who is a constant reader and will put her nose into ALL genres of books, the Great Gatsby would honestly not be my first choice. Yes, I love classical books, like Oliver Twist, Animal Farm...etc, but the Great Gatsby just did not snag my attention at all. See, there are a couple of reasons why I did not like the Great Gatsby. This book has to do with the American Dream, and different views of how people see it, and in this book, it seemed as if every single character was self-centered and cared only about their own thoughts. This book is not a very good influence to an extent. Seemed very selfish, but again, that's my opinion.  One other reason is that, I can catch a plot very quickly, it comes naturally, but since this book kind of bored me, and I was not interested, I didn't catch on fast. I didn't pay attention to who was who, and sort of didn't care. And if you are a reader, and that's what happens, then obviously something is wrong with the book. There were a couple of parts that were interesting like trying to figure out Nick's mysterious neighbor, Jay Gatsby, and when Nick, Jordan, and Tom drove through the Valley of Ashes, but that was about it. I mean, when they stated that Gatsby's fortune was made illegally, just kind of made me upset. Does the rich person always have to get the money from something illegal? And does someone always have to be murdered? I couldn't find anything worth reading about.  The book just seemed so selfish, shooting others because they were upset. Getting jealous because one person fell in love with the person you are currently in love with, having to be with the ""in crowd"", this book is proof that sometimes the wealthy can be just as stupid as the average American. There's really no difference. The Great Gatsby just talks about how the American Dream is also destroyed by money and wealth. We're being torn apart by power hungry people. So if you enjoy reading books that have to do with being obsessed with power, than this book is for you. But if you do not like cliched books than this book is not for you. Out of five stars I would give this book a one."
"1431",1430,"Ahmad Qassab Bashi","Couldn't even finish the last 60 pages or so. A lot of people find this book so great and a must read and I actually ""read it"" based on the number of recommendation I got in the last months but it was boring and so slow it seemed to me that there is nothing going on. "
"1432",1431,"Brittany","I just... I just hate this book. Pretty much despise it. It's so empty. It's like the TV show with the Kardashians. I vehemently hate this book. I didn't totally hate the movie though. Ha!"

I'm not even going to explain why I hated this book, just read my status updates.Just know that this was so awful it deprived me of reading. Seriously."
"1435",1434,"Raewyn","I read this book way too young. It was one of the only books in the green AR section that I hadn't touched by the time I was in 6th grade, so I read it. I should prolly read it again so that I remember more than being confused and that a boob is sliced off.... yup, that's it. It was odd and I didn't really get it. Don't you love it when reading level and social understanding are SO INCOMPATIBLE?! I know I do. :DAlso I love how the librarian had no questions about my reading it (and it was in an elementary school library), but made me wait to read Cages by Peg Kehret until I was in (gasp) 5th grade.

"1436",1435,"Allegra"," I absolutely hated it."

"1438",1437,"Jeff Kotowski","Some jackass can't get over his old flame. Oh, boo hoo. This is a lame book for snooty big nosed morons."
"1440",1439,"Jerome","Had to read it this year in eleventh grade. I would not have read it otherwise.Really boring. And the plot was so WEAK! I did NOT care about the characters, I could not sympathize with them.Set in Long Island, New York, F. Scott introduces a decent but uninteresting man, Nick Caraway, who decides to visit a second cousin but instead, becomes entangled in the past, present and future interactions of this woman's life. By not emphasizing Nick's personality, Fitzgerald helps the reader to focus on everyone else's. The second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, endures a pressured marriage as he commits adultery. Aware of her husband's disloyalty, Daisy only bothers to disguise her knowing. This opens the novel to theories of immoral behaviour and irony. For Nick's neighbour, Jay Gatsby, happens to be the past love of Daisy and is set on returning her to himself. F. Scott. gives his title character an obsessive yet submissive personality that revolves around Mrs. Buchanan. At certain points within the novel, this can become an annoyance. Gatsby's persistence on obtaining Daisy's affection only causes him damage. Such a plot can induce a reaction from the reader which deserves some praise until Fitzgerald forgets to place a period.Eventually the novel climaxes with tension and complication. Had Fitzgerald not involved such a tense plot with his writing, the novel would've been an actual bore. His constant babbling and unnecessary explanations can lead one into a deep sleep. Though he was unable to write without ranting on, Fitzgerald does deserve to be complimented on his diversion of personality and East Egg versus West Egg (old rich vs. new) dilemma; a diversion from the all too cliched rich vs. poor. Unfortunately the ending suffers most because it was too verbose. Fitzgerald leaves no suspense, which to some can be a good thing, but it takes too long to get to the results of the climactic events, thus one slowly becomes disappointed.""Slow to start"" and ""ambling"" are such understatements when describing this thing I can barely call a book, yet alone a novel. The overflow of useless and uneeded information in this thing makes it several chapters longer than need be. In fact, if Fitzgerald had written this book properly (no extra junk I could care less about) it would have been EXACTLY two sentences long- ""I'm rich."" and ""Oh, boo hoo."" The plot line resembles an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 (namely ""Let's sit around and whine about being rich. Next we'll get drunk and call each other names, fight, and run each other over!"" SHUT UP ALREADY!) I can rarely can say this, but I HATE HATE HATE HATE this book! I concluded that if Mr. Fitzgerald's personality was reflected in his characters, it is quite understandable that Zelda Fitzgerald ended up in an asylum (sp?). That book was the poorest excuse for literature I ever had the displeasure of reading. I did read it twice, but each time, I was disgusted with it. The characters in the story were worthless wastes of human flesh. Daisy was a ditz, Gatsby himself was a possessive stalker and everyone else didn't have enough brains to realize that they were all being used!!Tom, Daisy's idiot husband, actually took Nick to meet Tom's mistress! How much more stupid is that? Yes, I'm sure everyone with a brain cell wants his wife's family to know he's having an affair. And his mistress, well, all she wanted was to seem important, when everyone knew she wasn't.Nick was used by everyone, but he did nothing about it. Tom used him, Daisy used him and even Gatsby used him. And all the while, he thought Gatsby was God. He worshiped him.The book is SLOW and Fitzgerald's writing style is SO over-wrought and flowery that it really, really gets in the way of moving the plot (wait, was there a plot?) along. None of the characters are likeable. There was NO ONE to root for, therefore there was no emotional investment in this story. In the end, it's a VERY thin love triangle between rich, superficial people. That's it.It's also told through Nick's character, who is completely irrelevant to the story. He's only there to narrate it. Why do we need him? It's more effective to SHOW us what's going on rather than have Nick feed us all the details AFTER the fact. That device provides NO drama, suspense or anything else. In fact, you could remove Nick's whole character from the book and it would lose nothing. That's how inconsequential his character is. It only serves to separate us further from the characters and a story that are already pretty thin and distant.I was utterly bored with the characters and the premise. Yes, I sympathized with Gatsby, but as brilliant and hard working as we are to believe he was--he was actually a complete fool, blinded by love for a materialist jerk, which lead to his destruction. Ok, I get the plot. I understand the nuances in the book.However, the book, to me, just describes one party after another after another. And I don't just mean the Gatsby parties, I also mean the tea parties and all the conversations among multiple people who actually do not have anything to do with the plot. I forced myself to read the book. It was not a page turner. The characters were not interesting. And the entirety of the plot can be summed up in a couple of sentences.When I watched the Redford movie, I found Jordan interesting, as she was in the book, but the emphasis was on the annoying, utterly unlovable Daisy, whom, for some incomprehensible reason, Gatsby sacrifices everything. I will not watch that movie again!I think a bunch of divorced intellectuals have perpetuated this book through time and perpetrated it upon young adults. We wonder why kids do not read much--well here is a good example. Stop forcing them to read this book."
"1441",1440,"Ruben","Superficial crap. "
"1442",1441,"Pollopicu","This is my least-favorite classic of all time. Probably even my least favorite book, ever. I didn't have the faintest iota of interest in neither era nor lifestyle of the people in this novela. So why did I read it to begin with? well, because I wanted to give it a chance. I've been surprised by many books, many a times. Thought this could open a new literary door for me.Most of the novel was incomprehensibly lame. I was never fully introduced to the root of the affair that existed between Gatsby and Daisy. So they were in love...yeah..I've been in love too, who cares?Several times I didn't even understand where characters were when they were speaking to each other. I also didn't understand the whole affair with Tom and Mrs. Wilson.. and something about her husband locking her up over the garage...? huh? then she gets run over by a car, then he sneaks in through the trees and shoots Gatsby? wha..? still..why am I suppose to care about all this? Shallow and meaningless characters. Again, who cares? I read this book twice. 2 times. I just didn't get it. I can't believe this book is revered with the rest of the great classics. Truly unbelievable. Fitzgerald certainly kissed the right asses with this one. What garbage. Daisy quote:“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed.… “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts before.”...sob..sob.. boo-hoo-hoo. oh Please someone shut her the fuck up.

"1446",1445,"Sabrena Brimm","I found this book difficult to finish. It is based in the 1920's in New York. The narrator Nick is fascinated by Mr. Jay Gatsby who owns a mansion next door to him and spends a lot of time standing on his front lawn looking a green light across the bay. Gatsby also through a lot of magnificent parties that attracted many people. Gatsby began to become close with Nick and Gatsby tells him about his true feelings for Daisy. He tries to get nick to help him reunite with Daisy ,and it works, until Daisy's husband starts to get suspicious; which is dangerous because Tom is one of the few that knows how Gatsby got all of his fortune."
"1447",1446,"Ariana","I'm almost embarrassed to say this, but I really hate this book. Allow me to quote my friend Riannon:""It just comes off as a book about a bunch of miserable people leading miserable lives. I couldn't find it in my heart to care about what happened to any of them."""

That's how it is with these so-called classics, way overhyped. I think people focus more on the ideas in a work of art than the execution, that's why so many books and movies are overrated. My reading time is valuable and I'm not going to spend it with novels that put me to sleep. "

All right, maybe five cents for Nick Carraway, the narrator, but that's about it. Ultimately, depressing and boring. DNFWhy this is still required reading, I simply can't fathom..."
"1453",1452,"Anita Garcia","I personally had a hard time reading this story. I know it's supposed to be this great American novel, but I couldn't root for Daisy or for Jay. They were just so unlikable and I didn't feel a whole lot of sympathy for them."

"1456",1455,"Sherese","I hated reading as a child/teenager, so if the book wasn't assigned in school I didn't read it. ""The Great Gatsby"" is one of the classics I was never assigned to read in school so I decided to pick it up a few weeks ago at the library -- but do I regret that decision. I'm glad this book was never assigned as it would have been an absolute struggle for me to complete this for class. I carried this book around for weeks in my pocketbook just trying to get through it even when my copy was like than 200 pages. I try not to give up on books so I forced myself to finish but there wasn't a single thing I enjoyed about this book not one thing! Everyone knows the story so I won't bore with synposis, but found the book utterly dull & confusing with lots of geographical errors, timeline and plot inconsistencies. Makes me wonder how the editor of this book kept their job. "

"1458",1457,"Ulises","Qué fastidio."
"1459",1458,"Chloe Templeton","The great gatsby is a novel which takes on a very simplistic storyline and the fact that it is considered a classic has and allways will baffle me. The book follows a group of twenty somthings in the suburbs of new york city in the 1920s. The storyline follows a typical rich white american girl who cares more about wealth than happieness, whom is marryed to an adulterate brute who continues apon the novels main them ""american idiocy"" and sheer simple mindedness. I would not recomend this book to anyone with half a brain looking for a half decent read."

"1463",1462,"Anthony Cruz","When I starting reading this book, I thought it was going to be interesting but it wasn’t. When read the first chapter, I couldn’t understand it well. To tell you the truth, I had to ask for help from my friends who did understand it. Personally, I do not like this book, and I do not recommend it to anyone under the age of 15. I know what the Great Gatsby is about I just do not really know it from great detail. This is just my opinion on the book, but I do know what happened in the story and who was involved and how it ended. This book wasn’t the best book, but it did mean something and what it meant and what it was representing was the American Dream. The book was confusing. I read the first chapter but I didn’t finish the book. The book I know was told by the Gatsby’s neighbor. He is one of the most important people in the story. The other characters in the are the nick caraway, the cousin of daisy, Daisy, Tom, married to daisy, and Jordan Baker, and Jay Gatsby, and Myrtle Wilson, and George Wilson. First, Gatsby was military leader and a bodyguard for man name Dan Cody but when Cody died he left Gatsby 25, 000 dollars and becoming rich and successful. The reason he was rich because he was famous and through a lot of parties at his mansion, and he sold drugs. When He became famouss he made a lot of enemies. He didn’t have anybody close to him besides his father. He didn’t really like anyone. Near the end, he was going to the hospital because Daisy got pregnant. Tom got her pregnant and they had a party. Gatsby went back home and was in his car with Daisy, and Daisy drove the car. She hit Myrtle and they they stopped and drove off. She died and Myrtle’s husband came and killed the Great Gatsby and killed himself. Then at the funeral was held and only servants and his dad and Nick were there. This book was confusing but the book had meaning. The message It was trying to convey is that the American and fame comes at a price and it could cost your life. "

"1466",1465,"Charles Unwin","words can not express. how much I hate this book. F.

"1468",1467,"Sheeba Francis","If I could give zero stars for a book, i would have happily given it to 'The great Gatsby""(Not so great after all). I love classics, but it was a pain to get through this one. I couldn't care least of any of the characters; and I don blame myself for my incomprehension because there was no way of getting to know what was going on in the minds any of the main characters in the book due to the way it was narrated. I think the choice of the author to narrate the story from pov of a third person who was a complete stranger to the love affair killed the emotional quotient.And the love in itself was not convincing enough for me as the story between Gatsby and Daisy was told by Baker, whom i despised though i never knew why, over a few pages with careless attitude. I had a feeling that she envied Daisy for her beauty and attraction and was secretly happy for her misfortunes of not marrying her love, esp that now Gatsby was filthy rich and her husband's affair with another women. Speaking of Gatsby... 
""...he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward — and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away...""
 
‘I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night,old sport.’He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned backeagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presencemarred the sacredness of the vigil.
I just felt like shouting out loud ""Dude get over it!!!!! She is just not worth it."" I was supposed to to feel shock or sadness when it is revealed that (view spoiler)[Gatsby was dead (hide spoiler)] but, it was just 'oh!'for me...Finally coming to the CARELESS part of the novel...
""It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness...""
For God's sake, Daisy runs over a women, who was having an affair with her husband, and Tom being instrumental in leading to the killing of the Man who loved his wife, that is NOT carelessness. I call that vicious.The only redeeming quality of the book was Gatsby. He had a lot of intricate layers to his characters which ultimately failed in the mess of everything else.  So 0.5 stars for the book. [image error]"

"1475",1474,"Shelby Murrell","Personally I really didn't enjoy this book. I felt that it lacked story line and basked in descriptions. I like the concept of it but I just didn't enjoy the style of writing. I think it was just personal opinion. Whilst it may be perfect for others, it just wasn't for me really. I think one thing that didn't help was that I have seen the film first and I really loved the film. But as I say, not something I enjoyed, but may be suitable for someone else."
"1476",1475,"Vicky","I didn't really know what I was expecting when I ordered this book from the library. I decided a while ago that I would like to read some classics just so that I could get an insight on different literature. First of all I went to pick the book up from the library and it was no more than a few millimeters thick - I was suprised. Very simplistic book to read. It is almost childlike in away. Very gay and frivolous story line. Didn't get any enjoyment out of this book that's why I gave it one star. I read it in about 45minutes. So its not a very heavy book."

"1488",1487,"Saurabh Hooda","I heard about this book from some blog where some literary genius has said that great gatsby is his favorite novel. Taking referral from random stranger is dangerous, and that was very true in this case. I got the book online and read around 42 pages, which is one third of the book. It was as if some drunk is telling story of some events. I could not grasp anything out of it. It seem to me as if I am finding some path in darkness despite reading third of the book. No doubt I ditched it there. Must avoid."

"1495",1494,"Greg","The first time I read this was 11th grade English. At the time, I was not at all intrigued by The Great Gatsby. I understand that there's hidden symbolism and whatnot underneath the surface, but at the surface, this novel was just extremely mundane and while not difficult to read, it was extremely tedious just trying to keep interest in it. I just recently tried to reread it, got about halfway and decided I didn't care anymore, so my 11th grade self agrees with my current self on this one. "
"1496",1495,"Jade Bartlett","Despite this being a hugely popular book, I was extremely disappointed. Unlike other works by F. Scott Fitzgerald, this book was superficial and quite purely unnecessary. There was no depth to the book, and there just didn't seem to be any point to it. "

"1508",1507,"Nscangal","This book, I think, defines what I dislike in characterization. There was nothing at all ""great"" about Gatsby. I found him to be obnoxious. I found every character in the book to be obnoxious. It was one of those school books that you painfully plod through for the sake of the grade and sigh with relief when you've finally finished. And then throw it away and try your best to purge it from your memory.Yes, I think it was that bad."
"1510",1509,"Neil McGarry","This is probably shallow of me, but I didn't get The Great Gatsby when I first read it in high school, and I don't get it now. Back then, it was the storied significance of the green light on the dock that put me off; I felt stupid for not knowing what that was supposed to mean. That long-ago feeling is what got me to pick up the book once more. Today, I still don't know what that goddamned light means, but this time, older and wiser, I just don't care. I also don't care if giving it one star makes me an unpolished rube, because no matter what high school teachers might say, THIS unpolished rube has more promising books to read."

One word: ug......"
"1524",1523,"Kazuya Fukuyama"," I personally didn't like The Great Gatsby, the main character of this story is Gatsby who gave up his life to become richer and be with a girl he loved. Nick Carraway is a Midwesterner who moved to long island in the midst of the Jazz age around 1920s. His home is next to the mansion of Jay Gatsby who is the main character of this book and rich man who throws party that all of New York society attends. Nick Carraway is the narrator of tale of Jay Gatsby  The reason why I didn't like this book was that the story was too simple and story goes too fast and I’m not really interested in reading jazz age setting book and most of the story is happening in Gatsby’s mansion. However there are many good parts, for example author doesn't describe Jay Gatsby’s past until the end of the book which makes our impression more understandable and makes audience to consent about Gatsby’s past. There are lots of symbolism and questions about America’s future. I wouldn't recommend this book to my friends because in one word this book was boring for me but it has good composition of story and I liked the way the author wrote this story"
"1529",1528,"Jacklyn","I know many of my friends loved this book, but I found it to be rather... dull. I can see how it would be a favorite of intensely social people who love to play with ideas dealing with the interpersonal, but I found it was not very significant to me at all. The whole time I sat there reading, all I could think was how horrible all the characters are and how much their lives suck. I guess I just wanted a different book. It's worth the read for some, but I didn't find it especially interesting. "
"1530",1529,"J.c.","I feel like a total **** for not liking this book. I also feel like I've failed as a reader because I can't appreciate a famous classic like this. I mean, a number of my fellow avid readers and friends have raved about it and a few of them have even put The Great Gatsby among their favorites. It seems like almost all my English professors and lecturers praise it. I just couldn't get into it. Well, at least I made it to the end. A perilous journey to the end.Perhaps I'll reread it in the near future."
"1532",1531,"Alex Horn","Was an awful book, very confusing language, bland story line and characters have very little personality."
"1533",1532,"Iserrano","What is a great American Novel? How about one that tells the reader of the hardships that the main character goes through to achieve some easy-to-achieve dream. Well The Great Gatsby isn’t this, not exactly. Sure the man who treats the woman he wants to fall in love with him like an object, Gatsby, does achieve his dream of being close to the woman he loves by inheriting money then losing it to a woman. “And it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn’t get it. He never understood the legal device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye. ” So because of this Gatsby learned to value money, same old story. The poor become rich and learn to handle money. The dream was never achievable. As I was reading the book, I kept thinking, “How could a man possible think that a married woman is going to leave her husband because he has money, when her and her husband probably have more money combined.” It’s not realistic and that what I think makes a great American Novel. Something relatable. Another thing that the book lacks is a strong female lead. Sure you may think Daisy but she was in the dark most of the time, like an object being played with. I see it as; she knew only what the males wanted her to know. The author said in one of his letter to his editor, Max, “Suppose woman don’t like the book because it has no important woman in it.” It’s interesting to see that in the book it’s a woman that he is longing for and willing to give all his money to, a woman who stole his inheritance in the first place, a woman who gets hit and killed by his car, and in real life it is a woman who read, translated and enjoyed his work as did his wife. Yet he still worries that woman will not like his book simply because of how he has portrayed them in his book. All in all, I would not have read the book if I didn’t have too. Yes it was interesting it read and had many points that could be argued and this is why I think that it has remained a known book through the years but there is just something about it that made it a book that wasn’t enjoyable to read for me. However if I had to choose a book to support the Marxist lens of the feminist, this would be my first choice."

"1539",1538,"Eric Thomasma","To be fair, I should point out that this was a book that I was forced to read as an assignment in high school, so I had a bias against it from the start. There have been other assigned books that once I started reading, won me over with the story and/or engaging characters. But not this one. I found it boring, plodding, and a waste of my time. I don't recall the grade I received in that class, but I'm sure it was less than stellar."

"1541",1540,"Corley","I don't want to say that I hated this book...but I believe that's the best word to describe my relationship with it; the plot was boring, the characters shallow, and I couldn't ever get invested in the story. The only thing I liked about this was Fitzgerald's writing: lyrical and with vivid descriptions, I found it to be very elegant. It wasn't enough to save the book though. I'm not even going to bother with a real review."
"1544",1543,"Chichi","I'm sorry honestly, I am. I feel like I should love this book but I don't. I just hate it so much. I mean once you get past the language, the plot itself is just so flimsy and confusing and I just couldn't keep up. I had to reread the ending twice before I fully understand what was going on. The narrative point of view: an omnipresent neighbour turned friend, was just so confusing and I just couldn't keep up. I'm sorry Mr. Fitzgerald."
"1545",1544,"Tom Nencetti","Hated it. I don't hate many books but I hated this book. Don't see why it is rated to highly. Maybe it's the book version of The English Patient, it is named a classic so therefore everyone is afraid to say how they really feel about it. "

Hated it.Adult thoughts on the book? Still hated it. I disliked all the characters and thought they were shallow.This book has so many things that are wrong with this world: infidelity, murder, lies, greed… THIS is what we consider “classic”?

"1551",1550,"Johnny","I gave this ""classic"" another chance since it's so popular online. I only remember from my first reading years ago I was disappointed in who Gatsby turned out to be.The first third of the book is already boring. It annoys me how affaires seem to be an acceptable way of life. It's another one of those books, after each chapter I ask myself, ""What did I just read actually?""After finishing it, there's still no connection."
"1552",1551,"Shelley","About three quarters of the way through this and it's a DNF from me. I am curious to know where the story is going, but not enough to force myself to keep going. Google, here I come!"
"1553",1552,"Noeleen","Not my type of book, decided to read it as the film came out and it just dragged on. No intrigue just a boring dialogue. Sorry to say I don't get the hype."
"1555",1554,"Viktor Malafey","Книга ні про що. Мені не сподобалась :(Америка 1920-х років. На острів Лонг-Айленд приїзджає молодий чоловік. Селиться він поряд з загадковим ""Великим Гетсбі"". В фешинебельному домі того Гетсбі постійно відбуваються вечірки з купою народу. Ось в принципі і все :)Перша половина книги — це величезний вступ, прелюдія до чогось.В книзі всього-навсього одна якась значима дія і відбувається вона за 20 сторінок до кінця. Все інше — якісь балачки багатеньких мажорів ні про що.Хочу глянути, що ж вони зможуть зробити в кіно, які так хвалять."
"1556",1555,"Metanira","What does he want to tell me with this book? I really cannot tell."
"1557",1556,"Heather Hobbs","This book was dull and extremely non-captivating. I would not read this willingly again. Very little happened that made me want to finish reading it. It took over half the book for something important to finally happen."
"1558",1557,"Liisa","1.5 stars"
"1559",1558,"Chrissy Hunger","I couldn't relate to it as a teenager and I can't seem to relate to it now…it is just not my cup of tea."
"1560",1559,"Xavier Guillaume","For whatever reason I didn't care for any of the characters in this book. I just didn't get it, but maybe I should revisit it. It's such a shame because so many people love this book. I guess I should have a communication with them to find out why, and it will make me grow a liking towards it. It's kind of like Citizen Kane. A quite boring movie without understanding it, but once you read about the complexity of its nature, its really quite genius, supposedly at least..."
"1561",1560,"أحمد حسان","حسنا لم أكملها , هى من تلك الروايات ذائعة الصيت والتى لا تزيد عن كونها مجرد هراء , قاومت فكرة عدم اكمالها ولكن لم أستطع فأنا لم افهم ما تعنيه او الافكار التى يتحدث عنها "
"1562",1561,"Meygan","I thought I would appreciate this book more now that I'm out of high school.Nope."
"1563",1562,"Suzy","I'm not thrashing on Fitzgerald's writing style or anything, I just hated the plot of this one. A bunch of bored rich people with nothing productive to do, so they get into trouble. I know, I know, it's deeper than that. I'm just having a hard time getting past the wastefulness of their lives. "
"1564",1563,"Jasmyn","I read this when I was 14 in a college English class--maybe it was my age (very young), but I hated this book! It was so miserable and depressing, and there weren't any heroes or heroines, just deadbeats."
"1566",1565,"Daphne","I had to read this for some English class in High School. I tried to read this but couldn't because it was just so boring. Then I rented the movie, thinking I would at least get the gist of the book, I couldn't watch it. Just kept falling asleep. I find Fitzgerald and his contemporaries boring, and overrated. Don't even get me started on Steinbeck or Hemmingway."
"1567",1566,"Sally Sue","Why was this book written anyway?"
"1569",1568,"Shayna L","Rich people acting like rich people."
"1570",1569,"Dimps","I never really go into this book when I read it. But then again, I was in high school at the time..."
"1571",1570,"Livy","I'm not a big fan of this book. I think it's a glorified soap-opera, I have difficulty seeing it in any other light. I'm sorry, I just can't get past how blown up the plot is. "
"1573",1572,"Deb","Very depressing"
"1574",1573,"Chelsea","Read this book in high school. Hated it then. never want to read it again."
"1576",1575,"Diana","blah"
"1577",1576,"Diane","Book club selection for this month. Not one of my favorites, wasn't interested in it until about page 75. It did clear up a lot of questions that I had from my memory of the movie. I will watch the movie again just to see if I enjoy that.Watched the movie and just as boring as the book. Not a fan of F. Scott."
"1578",1577,"Charlie Hertel","Boring, boring boring."
"1579",1578,"Kristine","I read this in High School and even the teacher agreed the characters where annoying! Why do they torture teenagers with this book?It's a celebration of a self indulgent and self destructive culture. Which I'm sure unfortunately still survives in some enclaves of American Society."
"1580",1579,"Tes","It was all I could do to get through it."
"1581",1580,"Elena Kocevska Kuzmanova","znam deka amerikancive se potreseni okolu knigava...mene mi bese uzasno dosadna...kako i filmot:((((( BORING!!!!"
"1583",1582,"Shirin","Read it for highschool english class. Bored me!"
"1584",1583,"Mitch Morton","Keep it positive, keep it positive. . . . Um, the part where Myrtle dies is marginally interesting."
"1585",1584,"Delicious Strawberry","Wellp. If this is supposed to be F. Scott Fitzgerald's magnum opus, I certainly have no desire to read anything else by him. I found the storyline to be utterly trite.I'm not sure why this is such a classic. Daisy's husband has cheated on her more than once before, and is currently in an affair - one which an innocent (well, relatively innocent) man pays for with his life. I didn't care a whit about Gatsby. He certainly wasn't great.The first chapter was one of the most boring introductions I've ever read, and I tired of the constant reference to the advertisement for the eye doctor. Daisy's husband is a thoroughly unlikeable jerk, and it is because of his actions that several lives have been ruined, yet he goes on his merry way with his wife as if nothing had happened.This book is supposed to capture the feel of the Roaring 20's, but I honestly didn't feel it. I LOVE historical fiction as well as classics, and I'd heard of this book often enough that when this book showed up in a Little Free Library, I grabbed it. It was a utter waste of my time, and the cover is just god-awful. I don't see why this book is lauded so much, but to each their own."
"1586",1585,"Nicole Johnston","I personally did not like The Great Gatsby. I do not know if it is because I was forced to read it in English lit. last year or if I just did not like Gatsby as a person in the book. This novel was one of the worst I have ever read, worse than twilight. Although I will give F. Scott Fitzgerald some credit because I don't think anyone can write a book as horrible as Stephanie Meyers ( I think that's the ladies name that wrote twilight). So yes Gatsby was better written than twilight, but not by much. I did not like the plot, Okay I barely understood the plot. I mean who throws a party every weekend but then doesn't even show up himself all to get a girl? I didn't like any of the characters, they were all void of any real substance. I not only was forced to read ""A great piece of literature"" but I also was forced to write a ten page thesis on Fitzgeralds use of symbolism, which I bombed because I didn't understand it. I realize a lot of people actually love this book but unfortunately I am not one. "
"1588",1587,"Ally","One of my least favorite books in English class."
"1589",1588,"Denise Johnson","I think this is the first book I have rated a 1 star. I couldn't stand this book. Glad it is finally finished."
"1590",1589,"Shali","Besides the intense urge to slam all of the characters' heads together, bang my head against the wall, then throw the book as far away from myself as possible, my initial reaction to this classic was something along the lines of,""What. The. Heck.""The characters are insufferable (as I believe they are meant to be), and their actions drove me up the wall. It's really just a group of shallow people having affairs. The only thing that kept me reading was that I really do like the descriptions, and the time period. I also think the writing style is well done. It's just the story itself that bothered me."
"1592",1591,"NoelOdra","I first attempted this book when I was 20. I don't think I got to page 5... Anyhow, last week I decided to give it another chance - fought my way through piles of useless blabber till page 50 or so... The passion and diligence with which THE WRITER can talk and talk and talk... about nothing at all. "
"1594",1593,"Inclover","Obviously I didn't like this book either. The death involved and also the whole thing about the guy who wore the glove and rubbed that hand with vaseline. That was a little disturbing to me personally. but it was an interesting time piece I guess."
"1596",1595,"sadako","piece of crap cast vs. love. gimme break. only an issue for spoilt folks..."
"1597",1596,"Howard Pavane","I must be missing something re. The Great Gatsby. I found the story uninteresting & the book dull & a waste of time. As of late I've been reading mostly history, science and the ""classics"". This is the first classic that I did not enjoy. I anticipated reading a great work by a great American author (this the first book I've read by Fitzgerald - and most likely also the last)."
"1598",1597,"Michaela","When I started reading this 5 years ago, I really wanted to like it but it didn't work out. I couldn't get into the story and connect to any of the characters. Reading it was torture. The plot seems really good and maybe if I re-read it I would like it but I don't know if I want to go through that torture again. It's not my kind of book but obviously a lot of people love it so I would recommend everybody to give it a try."
"1599",1598,"April","This book makes me tired."
"1601",1600,"Morgan","I couldn't finish this book. I really disliked it."
"1602",1601,"Page","I obviously did not get the memo. Who actually liked this book? Vapid characters and a dull storyline... waste of time. "
"1603",1602,"Aiman","bleak characters ,non existent story.dull main character.no real twists .books don't make their mark on people through time setting alone .this book had a lot of hype around the web.sadly like a lot of famous books it failed to come close to it.what was so great abt gatsby any way.i mean seriously do some justice to the name of the book atleast.i tried to read the whole book thoroughly but in the end i just ended up finishing it for the sake of it.i kept hoping for some thing interesting to happen .but apart frm a woman getting squashed by a car nothing really happened.in the end it just left a sour taste in my mouth.better go gargle ."
"1604",1603,"Carly McElhose","To be honest I didn't really enjoy this book. I thought it was very long and boring. Towards the end of the book there was some interesting drama but other than that it wasn't that great. I didn't like the characters because I couldn't relate to them. Most of the characters were snobby rich people that get away with everything. The only reason I read this book is because I had to for my English class. This is not one of my favorite books. "
"1605",1604,"Demi"," I just all around wasn't a fan of this book at all. "
"1606",1605,"Vannessa","I really wanted to love this book! I tried so very hard to just force myself to love it but alas...it is one of my least favorite books. It drags on and on with little pay off in my opinion."
