"23",22,"GM","لأنها مبتذلة، وشاذة، وحقيقية.. اكتسبت شهرة واسعة في العالم، لا أجد تفسيراً غير هذا !!! أشعر أنني خُدعت، أعتقدت أنها قصة حب بريئة بين شخصين يعوق اكتمالها تباعد العمر. قرأت شيء من هذا القبيل في أحد المواقع. ومع ذلك أريد أن أوضح إنني لست من عشاق القصص والروايات الرومانسية لكني اخترت هذه لمعرفة التبعات التي ستؤول إليها القصة بسبب هذا العائق. كان تخميني خاطئ بالطبع، لم تكن الرواية كذلك بل تخطت الرومانسية للقرف. لم أتوقع أن تقع بين يدي رواية كهذه التي خرقت كل الخطوط والمبادئ والأعراف الإنسانية والدينية. أصابتني بالغثيان حيناً وأرعبتني حيناً آخر من شدة الإجرام في هذه الرواية.بإختصار تحكي قصة شاذ جنسي يحب الفتيات الصغيرات عموماً. يؤثر هذا الحيوان الطاعن في السن أن يشبع رغباته الجنسية مع طفلة في العاشرة من عمرها مثلاً على إمرأة ناضجة.ما يؤسفني حقاً هو استمرار نوع هذا المريض النفسي وعدم انقطاعه من مجتمعاتنا، فنجد أخبارهم تملأ الصحف؛ هذا هتك عرض طفلة ما، والآخر يتحرش بإبنته وغيرها من القصص التي يشيب لها شعر الرأس. أنهيتها بصعوبة بالغة لما فيها من لحظات باعثة للإشمئزاز والإنحطاط الخُلقي.وللتذكير: أنصح كل أم وأب له طفلـ/ ـة أن يوفر لهم سبل الحماية الممكنة تفادياً لحالات التحرش من الغرباء، ومن الخطر الكامن الأشد ضرراً من الغرباء وهم الأقرباء. حمى الله أبناء المسلمين والمسلمات من أي مكروه. ***نعم لا أنصح بها أحداً البتة."
"24",23,"Megan Ammer","I admit that I went into this reading with expectations and a little bit of hesitation. I knew the basic plot and controversy surrounding the novel, but tried to keep an open mind in addition to sitting aside basic opinions in order to comprehend this particular story. Unfortunately, due to my moral integrity or frustration, or something of the sort, this novel was extremely hard for me to enjoy. It took a while to reach a halfway point and I found myself struggling to the end. I didn't take to any of the characters; I found myself annoyed with the lot. I guess I felt sympathies for Lolita, at least enough to recognize that her situation was sexual abuse and kidnapping and to want Humbert to pay for all crimes committed, but I didn't like anyone enough to care much for the story. I suspected that much, anyway, before starting the story, but had hopes that the writing or some underlying hatred for Humbert would change my mind. Neither shone through, however, and the writing was just as hard to muddle through as the content. The language used is so juvenile, with euphemisms for sexual terms that made the whole narrative overwhelmingly awful. The language was too puffed up in order to disguise his criminal activity and too much time was spent trying to convince me that Humbert wasn't such a bad guy. The author, Nabokov, presented depictions of Humbert as a caretaker, loving father figure, and regular guy that failed over and over again as he continued to be the villain of this story. No amount of money spent could erase his flawed personality or bad narration. The only thing that kept me reading the novel was his incarceration, and even that doesn't end in death. I felt cheated when Humbert lives and Lolita gets killed off after living in squalor because she was forced to depend on Humbert for a childhood that taught her nothing but made her the sole victim. I despise Humbert and this story is just nothing but a terrible confession of a pedophile. I tried so hard to use outside material to better understand the story but could not agree with anything scholars had to say and found labels like ""comedic tragedy"" or ""erotic"" almost harder to deal with than the actual novel.

"52",51,"Nathan Schwartz","How, dear reader, shall I try and delve into the mysterious appeal of this overwrought compendium of strained metaphors and pretentious vocabulary into which I dove like a struggling child forced to learn to swim by an overbearing father, only to find the pool filled with tapioca. Such is the love for this sad little work that I am filled with trepidation at the chorus of disgust this review will surely evoke among simple minded readers; those who do not understand the harlequin longing for sentences that end without four or five parenthetical asides or a story that can be enjoyed without triggering the gag reflex on every page. Oh, the plot of the novel. The globules of gonadal glow. The grasping at the very the depths of distaste like a gynecologist feeling a tumor.Some, I have heard, justify subjecting unsuspecting diners at the binge and purge of a 1945 thesaurus strewn about this wretched story by suggesting the intent is satire. Someone may wish to remind them that satire is used to excuse everything, but in the end it excuses nothing, and subjecting me to this repellent story and then calling it satire is as clever as punching someone in the face and yelling “slug bug red”."
"54",53,"Rebecca Rogers","I could not even finish it; it was so disturbing. What made this book a classic? I get that the writing was great but the thoughts behind the writing are disgusting.

"68",67,"Toreisii","The fictional memoir of a pedophile who preys on a young girl named Lolita. I found this a tough novel to slog through with its overindulgence of French phrases (which I cannot read) and minutiae. It also left me emotionally numb, as if I had listened to a very long and boring lecture."

"82",81,"Isaac Cooper","Lolita is the most pretentious book I've ever read. The characters are immensely unlikeable (even Dolores), the story is repetitive, and the pacing is so incredibly, mind-blowingly, preposterously slow it hurts my brain. But the way it's written! It's so beautifully written!No, it's not. Anyone can write flowery prose; they have a whole profession of it called 'poetry.' But even by poetry standards the flowery prose in Lolita is tedious, and overly-wordy. In fact, the prose becomes so obnoxious that it actually takes away from the story itself (not that there's much of one in the first place - a stepfather rapes his stepdaughter, there we go, that's the story). Almost every paragraph will be halted to draw a useless, pretentious metaphor for no other reason than because the author wants to. Prose is like cinematography in a movie. Sure, you can have really great cinematography, and it can be really pretty and well done and such ... but if it's not mixed in with an interesting, compelling story, and with conflicted and complex characters, it's just masturbation. In the end, that's what Lolita really is: artistic masturbation. There's no attempt to make us care about Humbert Humbert or Dolores Haze whatsoever. In fact, by the end of the novel, I despised both of these characters and wished them nothing but ill will. I'm not saying the subject matter is too transgressive, just that this particular novel handled it in the worst way possible. Flowery paragraph after flowery paragraph, I grew immensely bored with Lolita, and had no feeling other than annoyance to all the main characters in the story. Should I not feel the least bit of pity for poor Dolores Haze who is getting raped by her old stepfather every single night?Because in my mind, I really should feel empathetic to her, and maybe even toward Humbert Humbert, but I didn't, and I don't. I didn't feel anything. Nabakov's writing is so pretentious I can almost picture him standing over his typewriter, masturbating to it. "
"88",87,"Rejoyce","how did i manage not to realize what this book was about? horror. I am now scared to read any more russian authors. I feel dirty."
"90",89,"Melanie Chen","After everything I had heard about this book, I was really excited to sink my teeth into it (hot chocolate, blanket, and dictionary.com close by). Now that I've finished, I honestly don't know quite what to make of it...I didn't like it. But I didn't dislike it either. Hence, this awkward state of tension I've carved for myself.I think my biggest issue with this book (aside from the subject matter, of course) was that the language itself had its ups and downs with me. I thought the prose was breathtaking at points, especially when HH was describing Lolita, and downright unnecessarily difficult at others. Especially when the book turns into a detective cat-and-mouse chase, I got a bit lost in the turns of Nabokov's winding sentences. As a self-implemented rule, I don't reread books (because there are so many out there that I haven't even read once yet!) but perhaps it is just a testament to Nabokov's skill that I must say this: This book BEGS to be reread.Oh, please, for the love of all that is holy, Melanie Chen, please, some day, way far from now, reread this book. There are so many elusive references and gentle reminders and nudges of word play that you undoubtedly missed the first time around! Perhaps now was not the best time. Perhaps after a boyfriend, a marriage, or maybe even a child, but some day come back and give a second glance to these pages.(I am glad I finally got around to reading it though. Till next time, then.)"

When an ex brought this book into my apartment one evening;he and I got into an epic argument about how over rated and depraved a book this actually is.

"145",144,"Aleena","WHAT, IN THE NAME OF GOD, WAS THAT?It was grave mistake to read this book. I came across this book in a bookshop and was horribly surprised when I read scanned its synopsis. Later I searched on google and saying that I was surprised is understatement of the century.Why did I read it? Because of the reviews and my naivety and stupidity. Honestly, what was I thinking?Anyway, this book was like a powerful gust which swayed me off my feet, filled my mouth with dirt and gagged me. THIS WAS PEDOPHILIA, NOTHING ELSE. IT HAD NO HIDDEN PLOT. NO. NOTHING. The worst thing about this novel was not its plot but the fact that people actually like it!!! to the people who said ”it was beautiful, it was wonderfully written, it had a strong plot bla bla bla” and then blatantly wrote that it disturbed me and gave it 3-5 stars I’ll say YOU’RE FULL OF SHIT.It is a classic, I get it. But it is okay not to like them. It is not a good enough reason to like this book neither is “it happens” or “but look at its end” it is not a sin to dislike classics. I don’t care if it was written well because the plot killed and i did not complete I only read up to the point when lolita’s mother died and humbert and she go about travelling. Rest of the story I gathered from different reviews. I was feeling so horrible about the world by the time I started writing this. “Wonderfully written! Chilling! Best book! 

REALLY? REALLY?

 There is fine line between wrong and right, morality and immorality and anybody who has sight enough to discern that would say that paedophilia is way too far on the wrong and immoral side and that it is not okay, neither is a book written on it.P.S I get the fact that everybody has freedom to read and like whatever they want and I couldn’t care less but if you liked this book I will judge your mental stability."

"153",152,"Alisha Hanson-Glatzel","Was Nabokov a talented writer? Yes. Is he a messed up ass who can't control himself and in turn damages others for his benefit? Yes. He gets no credit from me for his writing, he is a jerk who puts his pleasure over others pain. I have no idea why I tortured myself with this one. I got almost half way through and asked myself why I was doing this? Did I need to see into the mind of a pedaphile? Maybe, but I didn't need to finish it, so I didn't. Yuck!"

"191",190,"Marjuque","Oh muse why? why compose such boredom? why such painfully lyrical horror of sentences so devoid of stimulus. Why such an impoverished story lacking on such various levels composed of such indifferent ramblings so appreciated by the masses, because of the idea? because of the begining paragraph-perhaps, the only redeeming quality of the book I presume. Justice certainly wasn't done to the idea, it was rendered ugly if anything else. the problem was not the idea but the narrow perspective that was taken. I practically slogged through the whole thing thinking, thinking, thinking, when does this end. Yes that's right this book was horrible. I have nothing good to say about it."

"263",262,"Ivan","A dreadfully, stupendously, mind-numbingly tedious tale of a codependent pedophile, which could have been three times shorter, and twice clearer for the fact. This so-called masterpiece of literature should be in place of a sleeping drug. A pretentious and trivial tale of a social case, diluted with some Russophobic undercurrents and unbearably smug commentary on most insignificant events and things. Nabokov was just another logorhheic twit who duped the world into thinking he was some genius. I am really disappointed having ever got my hands on this book, as the time spent on it was better spent on watching the grass grow, or basically anything else."

F-it. I think this book is shiat. Yes, I am saying it. I have no idea why this is a classic. I admit to being classics stupid, so maybe that's why I don't get it. But to me, this is just a glorified and accepted account of pedophilia. And BORING as hell.The author, and I admit I know nothing of him, creeps me out and I find him highly suspicious just for writing this. The main character is an idiot and being in his head is so trite. I don't find his way of thinking to be exceptional or intriguing in any way whatsoever. I don't find the way the author wrote him as being beautiful or intriguing in any way whatsoever.Here is what I think of when I think of Humbert Humbert and Lolita:I got to 15% and I am out. It would be torture for me to continue with this. And yeah, I'm giving it 1 star. I will find another book for the challenge. I want to kill this book with fire. I never want to hear the word ""nymphet"" again. But hey, I'm sure I read it wrong, so for those who loved this book, maybe I'm just too dumb to get it. I found it offensive and boring; I'm not sure which is worse. This guy was like 40 or something and romanticizing 12 year olds and trying to get in their pants.

No amount of maniacal poetry and brilliant technique could make up for the actual goings-on of this story. Eventually even the writing began to grate on my nerves because Humbert Humbert is such a disgusting, repellent, horrible person with retarded delusions as well as an extremely annoying character. Every other line I thought, ""What a dumbass."" This ""dumbass"" echo got louder by about tenfold toward the end. How annoying is it to hear an incessant stream of dumbass dumbass DUMBASS when you're trying so hard to keep up with a poem in prose about a child rapist/murderer/psychopath? Trust me; it's worse than it sounds.I get the hype. I guess. I got it at about page three when I realized I hadn't read prose so delicious (the sound, not the excremental content obviously) in a long time. Clearly the book had nothing else to offer besides that and the foolish hope that it would end in literary revenge (foolish, because postmodernists don't like revenge), which is why I sped through the remaining pages. At least it was a fast read. Yeah yeah, Nabokov is a genius and all that, but god did I hate this book. Thankfully I got it for free from somewhere. Who knows.Also, no way in hell did I ever sympathize with the dumbass H. H. Nabokov's writing isn't THAT good. But I doubt anyone's is. No one could make something as awful as child abuse sympathetic...no one! For a real sympathetic psychopath committing a much more sympathetic crime, see The Talented Mr. Ripley (and, to a lesser, extent, Notes on a Scandal). No, the prose isn't as pretty, and the characters aren't as eloquent, but that's the point. Slick talking makes one more suspicious, not less."

I don't think there's artistic validity here, and I would discourage anyone who feels as though they have to read it to be well-read from doing so. The book is full of agony and depravity, and it's sickening to attempt to put a human and relatable face to such a monster. I believe the literary world would be better off if Lolita did not exist."

"323",322,"Gemma Herrero Virto","Igual parezco una inculta por hacer este comentario, pero tengo que ser sincera. Me ha resultado infumable, pesado, pedante, aburrido hasta la extenuación. Lo he acabado por cabezonería pura, pero hacía muchísimo tiempo que no me aburría tanto leyendo un libro.El principio no es tan malo. De hecho, me pareció que el escritor había hecho un ejercicio de empatía sublime al poder ponerse en la piel de un pederasta y explicar sus emociones y justificaciones. Pero, cuando comienza la parte del viaje, el libro se vuelve aburridísimo. No se pueden llenar cientos de páginas con los pensamientos de un neurótico pedante y su relación con una cría superficial y caprichosa. En cuanto a trama, toda la parte del viaje no tiene nada. De hecho, lo único que estuve deseando todo el tiempo, era que se despeñasen los dos en alguna carretera y acabasen por fin con aquel sufrimiento.El vocabulario del autor es tan amplio que abruma (yo creo que tengo un buen nivel de vocabulario y aún así, no creo que haya habido una sola página en la que no me habría venido bien tener un diccionario a mano). Eso cuando no se pone a hacer larguísimas citas en francés.En resumen, una de las experiencias de lectura más tediosas de toda mi vida."

"344",343,"Sabrine Faragallah","I've been waiting for the right time to use this word: abhorrent. And yet ever the empath, I feel the need to rationalize Nabokov's motive. While mildly interesting to understand a pedophile's mind, I couldn't help but wonder if Nabokov's goal was to make a mockery of English romance novels from Austen and Bronte. I began to piece together this hypothesis when I noticed how distracted I was by his overuse of esoteric English words and overly-dramatic first person narrative. To be honest, I started skimming through the passages 2/3 of the way in. Perhaps he felt slighted by the literary community that his native Russian works were not taken as seriously as he would have liked and his epic romance would be a vulgar and repulsive adaptation to forever curse English lit. I'm curious now to know ""the real"" Nabokov and might try another book of his to understand why a rational man would conjure such a story."

Humbert painfully scrutinizes every single insignificant movement made by Dolores, even as trivial as itching a bug bite, and he's just so tortured. There was a very small section of the book where all that appeared endearing to me, and then I remembered that the object of his desire is an underage girl. I was not convinced when he claimed that she seduced him. He was a grown man, and even made a few references to how young girls had different views about sex. He claimed throughout the entire story to love her but he doesn't know how unhealthy his affections are. He created a co-dependency between himself and the girl Dolores Haze. He needs her, and now that she has no living relatives she needs him. He reminds her that if she should take off, or get away from him that she will become a ward of state. If he wasn't going on about Lolita, he was paranoid that she was cheating on him and raving about that. Or finally, just raving and ranting for the remainder of the book. Author's Note""Certain techniques in the beginning of ""Lolita"" (Humbert's journal, for example) misled some of my first readers into assuming that this was going to be a lewd book. They expected the rising succession of erotic scenes; when these stopped, the readers stopped. too, and felt bored and let down."" I quoted this because it's true, but there are a few discrepancies. The author says ""the rising succession of erotic scenes."" There would need to be erotic scenes to begin with, which there aren't.

"401",400,"Antof9","I read this because I finally had to stop reading ""Reading Lolita in Tehran"" because there were just too many references to this book! I thought knowing the general storyline would be sufficient, but I kept feeling like I was left out or missing something, and since I'd never read any Nobokov, I figured I might as well read the famous one.And then I had to write a review of this.I'm all over the board on this book, so I'm going to copy some of the comments I made in the past few weeks on the Book Talk Forum (at BookCrossing) about this book. Hopefully they make sense :)My first real post on this book: Reading a book that makes you want to read another book, where I talk about having never read any Nabokov before, and finally connecting his name (that I'd heard many times) with this book.And here is where I post 2 of my main points: 1. that I felt I was on the outside of a private joke (in RLIT) by not having read it, and 2. He is an amazing writer, but the subject matter is really disturbing me. In addition, the blurb on the cover from Vanity Fair ""The only convincing love story of our century"" makes me crazy. It's not a love story when it's one-sided pedophilia.So then I got more into the book, and realized that the foreign dialogue (mostly French) was making me crazy! I'm usually so good at a variety of other languages when reading a book that I take pride in it! But I feel like I missed out on a lot of this one because so many things were more than just a phrase or two. So I started a thread on that.And then someone else started a thread on not finishing Lolita, and I came out and said it: I thought it was awful. And used my strongest words yet: ""It's not a love story. It's about a pedophile and the girl who can't get away from him. Sure there's more to it than that, but WTF? It's definitely not a love story. I'm sorry. I'm not a prude, but it was almost trash. The fact that the writing is so good almost makes the reader sympathetic to Humbert. YEESH! I don't want to be sympathetic to him. He's a revolting ass!"" It's just fascinating to me that people think this book is so great. Or beyond that, that it's a love story! Sure, it's very, very well written. But that does not a great book make. I think. So as not to be totally negative, I'll say one thing about the humor. At one point Humbert Humbert is talking about the Russian cab driver his first wife falls for. He snidely says Oh, he was quite a scholar, Mr. Taxovich. LOL! A Russian taxi driver :) In the same opening chapters, he refers to something as ""Mc___"", also in jest, but I lost the bookmark to where it was and will NOT re-read till I find it. What it made me think of was on the television show ""Friends"", when they want to make fun of a characteristic of each other, say when Chandler smokes, Rachel might call him ""Smokey McSmokerson"". So are these funny names, used throughout the show's run, a literary nod to Nabokov? Could they be? I doubt it. But clearly this was written before that show!Last, one of the saddest parts I read was near the end: But the awful point of the whole argument is this. It had become gradually clear to my conventional Lolita during our singular and bestial cohabitation that even the most miserable of family lives was better than the parody of incest, which, in the long run, was the best I could offer the waif. Heartbreaking."

"429",428,"Tina","First I have to apologize to all the very enlightened literary people out there who loved this story and found something special in its pages. I unfortunately did not:(I have struggled with what to say so I'm just going to share 
my
 truth. Firstly I read this with my book club, a group of 9 very smart and diverse readers and only 2 people (myself included) finished the book! So I can't be that far off base. At one point during reading this I was done trying to figure this story out, it truly made me feel so stupid!! I got the general gist but I know there was so much more. Nothing was clear, to me it felt like Humbert (the very unreliable protagonist) never said what he meant. I also felt like the tense kept changing? He constantly talked about him self in first person and third person... That was very distracting.I think this attempted to be funny but it was not for me. What I found the most intriguing about this book was how crazy Humbert is, in general I mean, because obviously you are not right in the head if you are in your late 30's and sexually attracted to 12, 13 & 14 year old girls. We all know that's crazy, but he was all kinds of other crazy too. I really wished I could have understood Lolita better but Humbert's view of her was too skewed, clouded and full of obsession. If we could get her side in a book that would be interesting as I think a lot of readers have just taken Humbert's word for what she was like. I just don't trust his interpretation of her... Finally this book is described by some as a love story... In my opinion this is not a story about love, love needs to be reciprocated for it to be, this was a story about obsession! "

To look something up you basically have to page backwards to the first page of the chapter, click on the link, then page forward through the notes to the item you're interested in, then admittedly there IS a link provided there to send you back to the main text.So to make the links work without constant paging back and forth, it's almost like you have to read the full notes for the chapter BEFORE reading the chapter. It's really distracting and pulling me out of the narrative. I thought it was going to be individual footnotes so I could look things up as I came across them - not one giant note for the whole chapter. (Little individual footnotes was how the intro is formatted.)You can jump from one footnote to another, from the footnote to multiple spots in the text, etc. But you can't jump directly from the text to the footnote!I think this is one book that would work a lot better with paper rather than this really poorly formatted ebook edition."

"522",521,"Serith","I understand that this story is told from the perspective from an unreliable narrator –I really do– but that does not make it any more enjoyable to immerse in ...nor any more comfortable to read about Humbert’s obsession with “nymphets”. I doubt those that love this book would say that they enjoyed it per se; it’s not that kind of a read. But for me this was too ...real. Stuff like this happens. People like Humbert actually exist. It captures a part of this world that I don’t really want to look at. I don’t want to study it, nor do I want to understand the main character. It’s not that I want to pretend this stuff doesn’t exist – it’s just not my top choice for escapism. Honestly, it concerns me a little that some readers sympathize so strongly with Humbert (especially when his defining character trait is a pedophile who can write pretty words). There are also many readers and critics that don’t connect and see this more as a character study – which is redeeming. My interests simply don’t align.So this is not a book for me. I never suspected it was and I should have followed my instinct – I just wanted to try something out of my comfort zone? Broaden the horizon a little. I gave it a shot and now that opportunity expired. Book closed. Sorry, but I think I’ll be much better off not finishing this one."

"550",549,"Quanjun","This is not a book that can be summed up in a 5 star rating system. You can't say, simply, ""It was amazing!"", ""I really liked it"", ""I liked it"", ""It was ok"" (the least possible of all choices), ""I didn't like it"", about this book and leave it at that. You'll find that you have to qualify your choice of number of stars, at least I do, so here it is.Let's take Nabokov's point, that a novel is for aesthetics and aesthetics only, it holds no moral, no point, it's purpose is for enjoyment. Enjoyment, you say. But here's where I have to split with the author's opinion about his own work. This book is narrated by a pedophile, not about his choice of icecream, but about his choice of victims, his acts of crimes. It cannot possibly be read in a vacuum where the reader doesn't care about these morals but only care about the beauty of the prose and imagery. So do we really end up enjoying it? No. Really, no. I won't speculate about Nabokov's motives. But imagine if this was instead, an actual romance novel between, say, two appropriately aged lovers torn apart by war. Would it not have been that much more enjoyable? If the language was used on actual love instead of this depravity masquerading as love, would we not love it, read it over and over again, declare it the best love story ever written? But instead we get this. Layers and layers of lies and deceit and just when you think it can't get worse, with great erudition, it does. In fact it gets so bad that it overshadows whatever opposite effect the prose is having.However, I've always liked novels that push the boundary. We can't live in a world where all books are written to be safe, to be feminist, to be for, I don't know, freedom. Because our world isn't like that. This book is refreshing, you don't expect this subject to be written, you don't expect it to be treated this well, you don't expect to read such a damaging crime in romantic words, and that's what was delivered. There is great skill in this book. I said I hated it. I do hate Humbert Humbert. He disgusts me. And to read the book is to be in his head, you want get out, but not before he dies. I feel I can only give the book extreme ratings, one or five stars. Nabokov demonstrated great skills, it is a novel of great achievement, it is extremely difficult to read, let alone enjoy.Nabokov said that people who can't finish the novel or refuse to read about a maniac are sheep. That's a little pretentious. There are many who would be beyond disturbed by the happenings in these pages and I think it's inhuman to say that inability to read through is weakness of intellect. Surely humans are composed of more substances than mere intellect. I'd barely made it through. But what I find repulsive are the throes of reviews who call this ""erotic"", a ""love story"", a ""romance"". I don't know if people are trying to pretend to get a supposedly great novel or letting their own depravity show through because they mistake the novel's popularity is a sign of the general populace's leaning favourably towards pedophilia. Don't read a fiction and pretend to understand a crime of this magnitude and think that you can legitimately (credibly) blame a book for your morals. Humbert Humbert is unambiguously portrayed as a villain. This is something I didn't want to add to my review because I thought it would be obvious. Do people discuss if murder is moral because of a book? No. But now everyone's pretending as if the book opens the discussion to whether rape and pedophilia is acceptable or ""understandable"". Get over yourself."

"583",582,"Sinem","Tamamen vakit kaybı. Bir ayı geçkin zamanda anca okudum zaten, bitmedi lanet şey.Kitabın neden bu kadar meşhur olduğuyla ilgili olarak şöyle bir tezim var; Batı'nın kibri. Batılılar orijini Rusya olan Nabokov'u kendi dillerinde yazı yazabildiği için yüceltmişlerdir. Ki Nabokov da tüm kitap boyunca Avrupa'ya ayrı Amerika'ya ayrı övgüler dizmektedir. Hayatının büyük kısmını Amerika'da geçirmiş bir insanın İngilizce gibi basit bir dili yetkin olarak kullanmasının övgüye sebebiyet vermesi Batı'nın kibrindendir. Bu kibir Batı dışındaki herkesi ve her şeyi küçük görmelerinden kaynaklanır. Ha bir de yazar Batılı birçok yazara selamlar çakıyor kitabında, bu da kitabın övülmesindeki önemli nedenlerden biri gibi geliyor bana. ""Batı orijinli olmayan biri bizim dilimizde bir kitap yazmış üstelik de bizim yazarlarımızı övmüş o halde neden bu yazarı ve kitabı göklere çıkarmıyoruz?"" tamam olarak fikrim budur.Kitaptaki ana konunun ahlaki olup olmadığı başlı başına bir tartışma. Ben kitabın toplumsal açıdan ahlaki olup olmamasıyla ilgilenmiyorum. Ama pedofiliyi bu kadar öven ve kitap boyunca meşrulaştırmaya çabalayan bir karakteri okumak hiç hoşuma gitmedi. Kaldı ki Nabokov kitabın sonuna kitabıyla ilgili olan hislerini yazmış ve orada da kitabında anlattığı konuyu normalleştirirken ""benim kitabım bölümler ilerledikçe pornografinin arttığı tarzda bir kitap değil"" argümanını kullanıyor. Kitabın pornografik olmaması 12 yaşında bir kızla 48 yaşında bir adamın cinsel ilişki içinde olmasını normalleştirmez benim açımdan.Kitap konu olarak zaten can sıkıcıyken bir de tarz olarak, kurgu olarak da yeni hiçbir şey sunmuyor. Rusya kökenli bir adamın -ingiliz dadılar tarafından büyütülmüş olmasını es geçmeyelim- İngiliz dilini yetkin biçimde kullanıyor oluşu kitabı Türkçe okuyan bizler için aslında hiçbir anlam ifade etmiyor. Kitabın ana konusu bu çarpık ilişki olmakla birlikte yan konu olarak da Amerika'yı boydan boya geziyoruz. Yazar bol bol çevre ve doğa tasviri yapıyor. Fakat ben kendi adıma Türk edebiyatında tasvirin allahı olan Yaşar Kemal ile zamanında haşır neşir olduğum için bu tasvirleri de zayıf buldum. Bu da kitabı orijinal kılan bir taraf değil.Tüm kitap boyunca 12 yaş çok küçük ya, istediği kadar kız rıza göstersin 12 yaş çok küçük diyerek okudum. Bir de hikayenin ana karakteri olan adam sadece bir adet 12 yaşında kıza aşık olmuyor. Adam tüm kızların ergenlikten hemen önceki dönemine vurgun. Fiziki olarak ciddi bir sorunu olmayan tüm kızlara hayran. Lolita'ya saplantılı derecede aşık ama 9-14 yaş aralığındaki neredeyse tüm kız çocuklarını seviyor. Bu durum da ayrıca çok rahatsız edici."

"593",592,"Jana","When I was 19, I had a few affairs with younger boys. They were 17, scared like little chickens, because I was so adult and experienced, had so much to teach them.

I sound like a slut. When I smelled Humbert Humbert’s pedophilia - it made me sick. No matter the language, Nabokov’s brilliance, no matter how an average reader doesn’t understand how this book is important. Basically, it’s just having sex with children. 12 years old children being gnawed by sickos. So I can’t willingly say that this this … this, this is goddamn the ultimate fucking best book I’ve ever read in my life. Bumbling, rambling, twisting, jumbling, sweating and pounding about having sex with children. Just to slightly turn the dice, not many people read Unni Drougge's book 'Hella Hell', about HumbertA Humbert. I wrote this review in 2002: 'You have to be ready and prepared for this book. But be open. It's not pornography, but man.' But, then man, then I was just a kid as well. Me and my bubbly hormones set off to build new pyramids.

If you start, it's worth going to the end tho. Nabakov unmasks the freak, and you can see that Lolita was utterly and completely not complicit in any of what happened to her, and certainly didn't love HH or desire him sexually. She was a sex prisoner, with no family, repeatedly calling HH her father and dad. Nabokov wrote a multi-layer incredibly language-rich text. But I'm not a literary critic - I just have to choose 'did not like', 'it was okay', 'liked it', 'really liked it', or 'it was amazing'.It was amazing, and I really didn't like it. 1 starGoing to do a 're-read' via Jeremy Irons narrated audiobook for classics club group read June 2014.

"624",623,"Adrienne van der Watt","I was really excited to read this book, as it has gotten such rave reviews... HOWEVER... its a story of a paedophile... the thought was so completely off putting, I had to abandon the book half way through it. Maybe I will give it another try, because admittedly it is extremely well written, its just the subject matter that I could not stand."
"625",624,"Lidia","When i started reading this book i already knew it was a classic, so you cannot blame me for having certain expectations from this novel, which eventually turned out to dissapoint me greatly. The first thing i cannot still quite comprehend is the accuracy of the description of H.H.'s states and sentiments, now how can one describe so amazingly keen a paedophile's feelings without being one? Either Nabokov was a genius, either he sensed those feelings himself. This storyline is disturbing in so many ways and damaged on so many different levels it sickened me. Humbert may write hundreds of poems and songs trying to declare the love he felt for Lolita, but he still didn't fool me into believing it. He acted always to his own benefit, selfishly and egomaniacally. The only thing i did enjoy about this book while reading it was its rich vocabulary, which did not cease to astonish me, for i am longing for poetic and literary middle engligh and late middle english vocabulary. As for the rest it really is a obscene plot with an even more sinister ending."

He kidnaps and repeatedly rapes a teenager, after all. But what do I know?"
"637",636,"Tammy","Ick!"
"639",638,"Rsr","Nabokov es considerado uno de los grandes autores del siglo XX y su novela Lolita es la obra más conocida y polémica. Con un control de la lengua envidiable, el autor desarrolla la historia con una cantidad de adjetivos, descripciones y alusiones a otros autores y obras, que alargan innecesariamente una historia que tan solo llevaría la mitad de páginas contar. Uno mismo tendría que darse cuenta que los párrafos no deberían llegar a longitudes de dos páginas y media.Las personalidades de los dos personajes principales están muy bien conseguidas y Nabokov consigue transmitir hasta el más mínimo detalle. Por otro lado, el resto de personajes están meramente nombrados, sencillamente porque son necesarios en el desarrollo de la historia, un echo que ayuda a reafirmar la obsesión de Humbert Humbert en torno a Lolita y a si mismo.Hasta el inicio de la segunda parte, la dinámica del libro aun es sostenible. La historia se adentra en el pasado del protagonista, para entender el estado en el que llega cuando conoce a Lolita. Esta parte es relativamente amena y la secuencia de acontecimientos es más o menos ordenada. La segunda parte sigue un hilo de acontecimientos más borrosa. Los giros importantes en la historia los destaca para luego perderse en un sinfín de anécdotas, generalidades, ideas vacuas y fantasías, siguiendo un cierto orden y a la vez caótico. Esas idas y venidas junto a los párrafos interminables con más adjetivos juntos de los que jamás se hayan visto hacen su lectura pesada, aburrida y se llega a perder totalmente el interés por el argumento principal.Este libro es recomendable para aquellos que no les importe leer un relato espeso y complejo, que disfruten de un vocabulario culto y sean lectores de otros grandes clásicos de los cuales Nabokov cita la mitad."

"649",648,"Jimmy","Lolita is a remarkable book. Not because it is good, but because of how damn dull and boring it was. And how uninteresting a character Humbert Humbert manages to be, despite his perversions. Has there ever been a more boring character? What, other than his pedophilia, makes him interesting? He is a shallow man with shallow pleasures. The only thing I got out of this book is the complete banality of evil, which (the phrase in itself) is banal.If you're reading this review, it's quite likely that you already know me and my tastes a little. So I hope I don't have to convince you that I don't hate this book because of the content/subject matter. In fact, I root for it. I root for this kind of subject matter to actually be able to move me, or to illumine some portion of human experience heretofore un-illumined. No, I don't seek a moral. But some kind of depth, yes. Some kind of literary 'umami'. However, no such illumination or depth came.And yes, I see the point (maybe), that this intense aestheticism is his out, it's H.H.'s way of life. It's his moral substitute. But I don't buy it. I think it's Nabokov's out. I think it's his way of not having to come up with anything of substance, but to be completely surface, to be fluttery and butterfly-ey, so that he can rely on his strengths -- i.e. pure surface-level prose, inane and beautiful in that ""decorative"" way. Yes, I mean that insultingly. The guy can write, but for what? He's like a guitar god, wanking out the notes. It's pure masturbation.I have no idea why so many people (and people whose taste I respect) revere this guy."

"666",665,"Bonnie Gail","I forced myself to read this book as it carries great literary prestige. However, it was a constant battle with myself to keep reading.

"667",666,"Colin Geer","Not my favourite book by any stretch of the imagination.It was, for me, a dreadful example of self indulgent, literary grandstanding, written to impress the reader with its technical linguistic virtuosity. It is almost universally praised and because of this and the plaudits that have been heaved upon it, I approached the book with an open mind. However, after finishing it - and I had to work hard to plough my way through to the end - I could not shake the feeling that this novel seeks to bolster the age old male myth of the promiscuous under-age female; the child-woman who leads men on: the knowing young sirens who are to blame for their own abuse.I have read much of the book's wordplay and the amazing feat that Nabokov pulled off - of having written a novel as 'good' as this in his third language. Well, woop-de-do. After pages and pages of alliteration, of clever juxtapositions and fascinating asides in French, all I could do was grit my teeth at the 'look how clever I am' writing being pushed in my face. An apology for paedophilia is still just that, no matter how well and cleverly it is written, and I would dispute even that reading of this book. 'It's just a story, it's ironic, it's literature' I have read many times, but no, I just don't buy into this view.Needless to say, I did not enjoy it."
"672",671,"David Burke","It seems a shame to waste such rich prose on such a repulsive story. After high recommendations for this book in various -how to write fiction- type guides I felt compelled to read it despite the subject matter. Overall, there is nothing redeeming here. "
"676",675,"Alyse","I am SO glad I'm done with this book. Of course the subject matter was disturbing, but I was actually VERY bored. One major complaint: 5-10% of this book is in French! I don't speak French and I have absolutely no intention of Googling every single word, phrase, sentence in this book that was not English. I am sure I missed some content this way. Whatever. Another major complaint: Humbert was horribly annoying. I did not feel bad for him (as many other readers report), I was irritated by his cultured and intellectual mask. His ramblings were out of control, impossible at times to follow and often seemed to be completely pointless. I am so glad to be finished with this book. I can say I read it and I could have a conversation about it, but I thought it was absolutely terrible. "
"680",679,"Adri Fernandez","For the longest time I avoided reading this, because I always thought of it as quite worthless, in spite of how much the rest of the world considers it a “Classic”. But I am a firm believer into the notion that in order to be “justified” when hating something, you have to know what the heck you’re talking about, which in the case of a book means you have to read it. So I submitted my very unwilling self into a forced reading of a book I didn’t want to read. Which is the wrong approach to reading, really, reading needs to be spontaneous, a book (no matter how beautiful) won’t have any value if it’s forced.Did you ever wonder why so little people like reading? Because they got forced into it when they were kids, and not only did they get forced into it, they got introduced into the “horrors” of reading with books that obviously weren’t meant for them, which made the whole experience more excruciating, hence they marked in their brains forever and ever as “reading equals no fun and frustration”. I’m talking about you, crazy English teachers…Even though I tried to start this with an open-minded approach, I couldn’t avoid my underlying disgust with this book, and I have very little patience with it. And now that I’m 3/4 into it I can just barely stand it (at least I was, when I started writing this post, I’m quite done now, and happy to be done). The only reason I can keep going is simply because I can read, no matter how annoying it is, because I have other “better” books waiting for me to get done with this crap, so I can be a happy enthralled reader again, and one annoying book can’t kill my interest.For those of you that don’t know it, or who have had the luck to only hear about it, Lolita is the story of a man, who develops a very unhealthy infatuation towards a twelve-year-old girl. Some descriptions go along the lines of “A man developing disturbing feelings towards his stepdaughter…” but this, although to a certain degree true, is not correct, and it doesn’t properly imply the actual despicable character known as Humbert Humbert.You see, monsieur Humbert, didn’t just suddenly sprout a sudden interest towards his stepdaughter, oh no, darling, unfortunate monsieur actually has a history preceding his encounter with the little waspish girl, a certain Lolita, endearing nickname of one Dolores Haze.Be warned, this post is full of spoilers, so if you wish to read the book (I have no idea why anybody would willingly want to read it, unless they’re insane like me – don’t be like me) and don’t like knowing how it ends, stop reading this blog post.The Story:The first part of the book (the whole book is written in first person, as a sort of “confession” from a convict) is dedicated to monsieur illustrating his past, describing his first childish love and the failure of that first adventure.When you read comments from people, describing how already in chapter 4 of the book Humbert describes himself kissing his darling Lolita’s open mouth, it makes you wonder if anybody did actually ever even read the damn book.Probably not, because if they had they would know better, and they would know that the open mouth didn’t belong to the title child, but instead to another, some Annabel, who was at the time the same age as the sad Humbert. And while their behavior was not exactly within the norms of decency, at least it was somehow “natural” (I hate this word), and between two clueless kids.Now, the whole book seems to imply, even though the Humbert character himself scoffs at the idea (by constant “nabs” meant for the “psychiatrists” reading his confession and trying to “rationalize and analyze, and explain” his behavior), that his obsession with early pubescent girls was born from this fatal failure to realize his carnal wishes with Annabel, that for the rest of his life he tried to fulfill his desire with surrogates, and failing, of course.(view spoiler)[Monsieur Humbert actually got married in this story, twice. His first marriage crashing into a Divorce and his second marriage finishing in a more tragic way. During his description of his second marriage monsieur Humbert often laments to not being able to use the same “techniques” he could apply on his first wife, in order to get his way, since he had to keep a charade of dreamy ideal behavior to enthrall the mother of his little darling Lolita. In other words he not only was a Pedophile who married without interest or love, but merely to put up an appearance of decency, but he also was an abusive husband who threatened his first wife in order to “keep her in check”. This, however, didn’t stop his first wife from finding herself a lover and eventually running away with him, and thus divorcing monsieur. Humbert reports with some complacency, that his ex-wife and her new husband died in some badly conducted experiment.After this divorce Humbert moved to New York, to claim an inheritance, which allowed him to live comfortably without really working, and to pursue weird pointless projects that brought him in some extra cash to keep on living an easy life. This part of the book is ridiculously boring and pointless really, Humbert is a detail freak, he goes into endless elucidations of his activities, of his “little” obsession, of the habits he cultivates to somehow curb the sharp cruel edges of it, with little luck as he ended up having nervous breakdowns, of how he came to design the definition of Nymphet, pages and pages that kill your brain cells one by one and convince you that getting shot in the foot would be a better option than reading on.Eventually, circumstances arise that allow him to enter the Haze household, completely by accident, he wasn’t even planing to stay, until of course he finally came to behold the object of his desire, the incarnation of every past, present and future desire, Lolita. It is in this household that a (very stubborn and persistent) reader gets finally introduced to the title child and her mother (destined to become the second wife). It is in here, where the story actually starts, where monsieur focuses all of his pointless obsessiveness for detail into describing each and every little encounter with Lolita, whether it be just an accidental glance or a long “innocent” meeting (innocent because nothing really happens, but not really because of the way Humbert talks about them), and records everything in a tiny little diary of his.Lolita’s mother falls in love with Humbert, and confesses to him through a letter, that she leaves behind while she’s driving Lolita off to a summer camp. Humbert at first is disgusted at the idea, but then he contemplates the possibilities and decides that marriage is, after all, the best option. So he marries her, and is baffled by the discovery that Mrs Humbert, seems to be a very bossy kind of woman, she also seems to shatter all of Humbert’s plans, by planing to send her little girl to a boarding school (oh! The horror!). While our Valiant Humbert is trying to work out a way to make his wife see reason, disaster strikes, for she, curious and jealous woman that she is, discovers his secret diary.“Hell hath no fury like a woman scorn’d”And furious she was, understanding the nature of the betrayal, she set forth to write some letters, one for her daughter, one for divorce and one for Humbert. But alas, on her way to the mail collector, she got run over by a car, her missives in her hand and soon destroyed, her anger extinguished like her life, and Humbert feeling that fate was on his side indeed.So he did what he wanted to do all along. He managed to snatch Lolita off from the summer camp, and got her all to himself, for a while. The first year found them traveling from town to town, and state to state, pretty much all over the place. The book here is so unbearably dull, that I couldn’t even focus on it properly for most of the part. Which is absurd since here is when things actually happen.Oh, Humbert Humbert had the most harmless intentions at first, he just wanted to revel in his trophy’s glory, with her unconscious, and him “safely” and “harmlessly” fondling her (as if this made it all less disgusting…). But Lolita would have none of it, after confessing that indeed she already got initiated into the activities, she hastily went to show Humbert what she learned…After pages and pages of pointless listing of random places, and accounts of the subterfuges Humbert had to resort to control the little monster he was creating, parenting ignorant that he was, monsieur and “daughter” settled for a considerable length of time in a little town, equipped with a little private school for girls, where she could get educated in the life changing matter of “how to catch a husband”, as was the case at the period of account.It’s basically all downhill from here, spoiled and traumatized creature that she was, Lolita grew to despise her “father”, who didn’t fathom anything until it became glaringly obvious and entirely “too late”. Feeling that she was slipping away from his grip, he panicked, and again dragged her off to a second road trip. This is another thing that makes you wonder if anybody ever read the damn book, at no point did she ever grow to be in love with him, indeed Humbert often laments how she would recoil from any of his amorous endeavors, and just barely tolerate his advances, although it didn’t deter him from exploiting her dependency on him to get his way with her.The second road trip did not go the way Humbert wanted, on the first road trip neither of them had a plan, but on the second one Lolita was the one with a plan, and Humbert had no more than a dim idea on how to bind her to him forever (very sick ideas actually). During most of this mindless listing of places (again), Humbert notices a recurring figure. At first Humbert (at least self-aware enough to know that he was a fanciful paranoid creature) half believed it to be just a figment of his paranoid imagination. Thus the road trip proceeded, Humbert, Lolita and their mysterious pursuer whom Lolita seemed to know closely.Pages and pages of nonsense, with Humbert becoming paranoid, Lolita at points irritable, at points distant, at points quietly complacent and a mysterious man pursuing them and becoming bolder over time, coming into fleeting contact more often, and more frequently, looking at his own object of interest (Lolita herself), as old and despicable as Humbert himself. And then, Lolita got severely sick, and needed to be hospitalized due to a rather debilitating cold. The same cold Humbert himself got a few days later, which incapacitated him so badly, he could not go pick her up on the day she got released from the hospital, instead she got picked up by her “uncle” known also as the man pursuing them. She basically went from one pedophile to another…and disappeared.Poor Humbert, you almost feel sorry for him at this point, almost.The rest of the book is just him explaining what his life was “after Lolita”, of his futile attempts to find her and of what he did after he realized she was gone. The whole book is exceedingly boring (in spite of its main theme) and this part is the most boring of it all, really. Ah, but the book is not over, it just goes on and on analyzing his boring endeavors at life until, just as you start asking yourself why you’re still reading, a letter by the elusive Lolita finally comes.She’s married, and pregnant and in grave economical disgrace, as could be expected. Humbert finds her, and sees her and tries to persuade her to go away with him, but she won’t budge.And here we finally hear the truth, she had never any interest in Humbert, in truth she cared about another, of Humbert’s age, the mysterious pursuer, whom she calls Mr. Cue endearing shortening of one Clare Quilty, former neighbor and close(ish) friend of the Haze household, a famous playwright, who had been lusting after Lolita’s impressionable mind long before Humbert came into the picture, and who eventually stole her away from him. It was with Mr. Cue with whom Lolita designed the itinerary of the road trip, him who followed, him who eventually picked her up from the hospital, him who threw her out when she didn’t do what he wanted her to. Oh Lolita was more than willing to give herself up to Mr.Cue, but he turned out to be quite impotent, and preferred to take his pleasure in watching pubescent children indulge in carnal endeavors. When Lolita refused to participate in her destined “role”, he threw her out of the house where they had retreated, and Lolita was left to fend for herself.It is in her favor to discover, that instead of going back to Humbert, she chose to live on her own, struggling and working hard, but independent. She found herself a husband, a simple, earnest, honest, and hopelessly poor fellow, from whom she came to expect a child, and finally giving in to the economical strain of her living, decided to contact Humbert, and ask him for help. After getting thoroughly denied, Humbert left her all the money that in truth was hers, which came from the rent obtained by the tenants of her mother’s house, he informed her of the state of her inheritance, and left her finally free to do what she wished with her life.At least Humbert didn’t cheat her on this subject, but then again he had no interest in anything anymore, he was driven by one sole purpose. Armed with a tiny Colt, his objective was simple, he had to blame someone for his loss (certainly not himself), and avenge it somehow. And here the book barrels into its fitting drawn-out absurd ending. (hide spoiler)]The Characters:Humbert: Ah, our main character, our unrepentant “sinner” who applies to us, the readers, for understanding, but not forgiveness. So little development, so “set in stone”, so very hard to empathize with. One can “understand” him to a certain degree, but nothing in the story makes him even remotely redeemable, or likable. He’s a detail freak, obsessive, fanciful, paranoid, and attracted to little girls.Lolita: Our heroine, of course, the book can only show her in the distorted version perceived by Humbert which is not a very flattering perspective. Oh Humbert worships her immensely, don’t get me wrong, but he depicts her in a way that seems to imply her inviting and craving his attentions, which makes her nearly as unlikable and disturbing as Humbert himself. Oh she had a crush on an older man, certainly, but what girl child doesn’t? That doesn’t justify grown men lusting after them. And while leaving Humbert didn’t quite work out the way she expected, she still preferred to set herself lose from the shackles imposed on her by fate, and that makes her quite a great character. Her depiction was relatively realistic (in spite of the grotesque vision of Humbert) in the exposure of her young teenager behavior, her moodiness and her resentment. The tragedy of her life was being born to a mother that despised her, and falling in the path of dangerous men.Clare Quilty: A playwright and Lolita’s true object of desire, a character even worse than Humbert himself, a feat quite hard to achieve indeed. Shameless, entitled, careless, callous, a smooth talker, so used to having people around him, he’s indifferent to them all. He had no qualms at the prospect of getting rid of Lolita, nor any regrets over his behavior.Charlotte Haze: Lolita’s mother. Her behavior towards her daughter was ambiguous and confusing. In Humbert’s twisted view, she seems to struggle between her instinctive female jealousy of Humbert’s attention, and her wish to educate her daughter properly.Final thoughts:I hated this book when I started reading it, I hated it when I was midway, I hated it when I started writing this post, and I still hate it now that I have finished both the post and the book. It can be a “classic” all you want, but it’s still a ridiculously boring book, there was so much nonsense of little to no consequence, meant only to desensitize the reader towards the absurdity of the story. I still firmly believe that people never really read it properly.This post has almost 3000 words, I hated this so much I spent a lot of time writing about it…I just needed to release all the venom that was trapped in my head while I was reading.This book was so terrible I had to roll my eyes often to check if my brain cells were still there, I’m pretty sure I lost a couple…(This was taken almost word by word from my blog about this book :P)"
"685",684,"aol","I honestly don't know how to feel about this book...I wanted to get my hands on 
Lolita
 for a very long time. I waited so long to experience the beauty of the writing style this book claimed to possess. Unfortunately, disappointment hit me hard on this one.I feel betrayed and kind of glad that I did not waste my money on buying this book but rather choosing to borrow it from a good friend of mine, but nevertheless... Betrayal is still crawling upon my emotions and feelings. I honestly thought my reading experience with 
Lolita
 would be the unforgettable sort, only to wake up to the reality that this book is nothing but empty pages colored with a disturbing concept.To be completely fair and honest, the writing style is very beautiful and unique. The concept of the book is not! For those of you who are not aware of what 
Lolita
 narrates: It's a novel about a middle-aged college professor falling in love with a 12 years old child and rapes her.:\ I couldn't get to the ending. "
"686",685,"Jackie","First of all, I read this book because it was on a list of the 100 Greatest Novels of the 20th Century. I knew that the subject matter would be hard for me to get through since I teach middle school and have a daughter of my own, but I figured that reading this would probably be a good challenge for me.I understand that Nabokov usually writes from the perspective of unsavory characters and Humbert Humbert is exactly that. The language of the book was very well written and I loved the descriptions of mid-century America, but it was all I could do to get through his descriptions of Lolita and his other ""nymphets."" There was more than one occasion where I put down the book after reading only a paragraph or two, because I would feel so angry that I didn't think that I could lend my concentration to the words on the page. It was sickening to be in the head of this pervert.The book makes it sound as if Lolita seduced Humbert and the reader is supposed to be shocked at just how much control she has over him, and shocked at how she knows it and uses it to her advantage. HELLO!!! She's a 12-year old girl. Anybody who has spent any amount of time around 12 to 14-year olds will tell you that there is a lot of hormonal stuff going on there. However, they are not adults with adult minds; they are children and their minds and personalities are still developing. It is within their nature to push boundaries and, yes, at times, to act provocatively. This does not make them sexual beings or ""nymphets."" The whole idea is disgusting. It makes me furious when I watch the news and hear about another teacher having inappropriate relations with a student. Even more so when the teacher says that they are in love with the student or that they were ""seduced"" by the student. It's just stupid! In order to fall in love with someone or to be seduced by someone, you must first be on the same level as that person. If one is above the other in rank somehow something just seems ""not right"" about that relationship. Adults are done developing, both in mind and body, and to take advantage of a young person just discovering who they are, deserves a special place in hell. Lolita is supposed to symolize America and Humbert is Europe. I got that from the book, but I didn't really get anything else from this symbolism. I just felt like that was something the author put in there to give this book some intellectual credence.In the end, Lolita does leave Humbert, though it is for another arrangement which is just as bad for her, and he goes three years never being able to track her down. She eventually marries and gets pregnant at 17 to a young man who is, at least, closer to her own age than Humbert. Humbert also eventually tracks down the man who he considers to have ""kidnapped"" his Lolita and kills him; and from the way that the book is narrated he appears to have ended up in prison. However, I was personally hoping for a castration-by-Bowie-knife ending. Maybe I just couldn't overcome my own disgust at the subject matter and I have totally missed the mark on this book. I don't know. All I know is that any man remotely resembling Humbert Humbert in thoughts and behaviors who comes near my daughter will get stabbed in the eyes with whatever I have handy."
"695",694,"Myke","I gave this one a shot, but really, no matter how well it was written, or what point he was going for, i had to put it down after about 200 pages. It's possible that there is some grandness to the novel which only comes with finishing it, but i just couldn't read about anymore pedophelia. I couldn't take this book BEFORE i had a daughter, now just thinking about it makes me mad."
"704",703,"Dana West","Great writing. Horrible subject matter. Anyone saying that this is a ""love story"" must be delusional like HH. This is a story about lust and greed, period.I've read many classics, it seems to be that this one is a classic by default. It is not obscene, it is not pornographic, but it does make me uneasy. Any abuser justifies their actions like HH. He trapped her, he used her, he was ready to put her aside until he realized that she wasn't his alone. What a douche. Favorite line: Lolita speaking to HH ""He broke my heart, you broke my life"" (or something like that)."

"714",713,"Dark-Draco","As this is on the list of 1001 books you must read before you die, I was expecting great things. Unfortunatley, I just couldn't get into it. Although the subject matter is, obviously, disturbing, this wasn't actually what put me off. I just found the 'diary' entries very self-indulgent and, to be frank, boring! They also tell you how the story ends, so I decided it wasn't worth persuing when I have such a large number of books still to read."
"716",715,"Whitney","Reading this book was like ordering a classic cocktail whose name is instantly familiar and loaded with cultural connotation, but which you have never before tasted. And when you finally try it, it's kind of gross. You wonder how on earth it ever attained the significance that people now attach to it, or how people can order it on a regular basis without referring to its extreme bitterness (even if, for some the bitterness is part of the pleasure). And you are able to think, ""Now this is part of my cultural context...but I never need to order it again.""This is not to say that there are not passages of wonderful imagery or that the work is not clearly that of an author at an advanced stage of intellectual sophistication. However, the topic is so poisonous as to overshadow whatever literary merit might otherwise be gleaned from it. I decided to read this book after the background of reading both Stacy Schiff's biography of Vera Nabokov and an earlier VN novel, ""The Gift."" Now I feel no need to go further into the Nabokov oeuvre."

"731",730,"Zeke","Oh man, this guys name was humbert humbert. I want to say that I completely understand Humbert's preference, however I didn't find the guy to honestly be such an intellectual, but more of a person who is simply mixed up about his choice in women. A more normal person in his situation would marry a women that could make him feel loved, and masturbate to child porn in secrecy like an actual person, but there is not a single nymphet in the world that would actually be like any of the ones in this book. If you haven't actually met any five year olds yet, they are very small, very stupid, and they make fart noises for fun. They won't find anything attractive except for butterflies because they have no sexual urges. In fact had anyone met Humbert in real life, they'd probably just try to stay away from him, because most people don't put that kind of attention in women of that age. The book isn't bad it's jus- wait. Yes it it.I didn't finish it :)"
"737",736,"Diedra","A narcissistic exercise of felony crime that parades about as literature. The objectification of Delores by Nabokov serves as a reminder that the victims in all such crimes are still silenced.

I CANNOT get over the reviews that I have been reading talking about eloquent prose...really, people? Is everyone else able to get past the fact that this protagonist is a sick, pedophile????

"790",789,"Gwen Haaland","My Book Discussion Group picked this one. It was one of my least favorite books due to the disturbing content, immorality of the main character and child abuse. Unfortunately I could not get beyond that enough to enjoy the authors beautiful writing style. "
"791",790,"Patrick","The way that Nabokov portrays Humbert is that he feigns weakness although he is the perpetrator of the crime.The character Humbert Humbert is a perverted child molester that I have a hard time indentifying with. The only reason he likes Dolores Haze is because she is pubescent not because of her innate qualities although later on in the book he claims he loves her. At least in the movie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Benjamin and Daisy inequality of external age is redeemed by the fact that they are soulmates. Be that as it may, Dolores Haze is a sexually precocious teen who seems eager to experiment with sex especially with an older man. But to Dolores it seems that she just wanted to experiment, she was not expecting to get in a relationship with him.Even taking into account Dolores Haze's sexual precociousness, Humbert's mind is utterly disgusting because he willed this dalliance into taking place. Despite playing the victim in the novel, it was he who married Charlotte Haze so he could get to Dolores; it was he who wanted Charlotte Haze dead and after she died, he was happy and made a plans to kidnap Dolores Haze. Also, he takes advantage of the fact that he is the guardian of Dolores and the only one she can trusts for his own sexual pleasure. Their relationship reminds me of a pimp and his prostitute with stick (threats of the ""horrible"" CPS) and carrots ( buying her stuff and taking her places); thus it takes a tone of an abusive relationship.As the novel progresses, I feel good that Humbert is becoming paranoid and clingy toward Dolores. Karma finally bites him in the ass.I think that the good thing about this book is that it shows that a guy in his 40's and a teen do not work in a relationship because their interests are too different. Although Humbert likes to keep Dolores as his sex slave the longer they are together the more he has to be her caretaker/guardian. As the book progresses, Humbert and Dolores relationship really takes on a fucked up protector/protectee form. That is Humbert although he is lustfully hurting Dolores, genuinely loves her and protects her from the other man who molest her. For her part, Dolores despite running away seeks Humbets monetary help. Although it does not excuse the horrible act that child molester perform, this book does show the complex relationship between a child molester and the child (the child molester being the aggressor and the protector).This book begs to question: ""what happens to sexually abused children?"" Are their future reltionship dictated by the past of being in an abusive relationship with their father figure?"" and ""How can we help child molestors not lust after children (b/c as this book points out, Humbert does realize he is doing something wrong to Dolores just he cannot stop him from wanting to have interecourse with her)?"
"792",791,"Tulika","The book made me sick. I know that is probably the whole point, and that I should appreciate Nabokov's genius in his effort at getting into the psyche of a pedophile, etc., I couldn't. Not a single line in the book was humour for me, nor did I for the faintest moment sympathize with Humbert. May be I feel too strongly on these topics, but I wouldn't ever recommend this book to anyone. In my view, the most overrated book of all time."

Though some of the writing/prose was somewhat compelling, I didn't need to delve into the sexual domination, manipulations of the protagonist.I know people out there think this is some sort of masterpiece, but I'm not one of them. I got the concept because it really wasn't that deep, but talk about boring. Two times going on trips and each just as dull as the other. Staying at the same type of sleazy hotels, motels, etc. It just seemed to ramble on and on and at times, virtually said nothing new. The best part was the ending."

I won't dog you if you loved it, but I hated it and it made me sick.I read that Vladimir likes to write his stories from the point of view of a detestable character and then lead them to failure but I can't get past this one. What you're supposed to do is hate Humbert, and you're supposed to read all the way to the end where everything crashes down. It's so horrible the way he talks about the little girl, though. Too real for me. Too twisted for me. I can't see how anyone can make it all the way to the end to find out about his demise.I wish I could give it negative stars. It was that bad.

Amidst the skin crawling creepiness, I admit, I did laugh out loud once. It was when (view spoiler)[Humbert and Lolita were in the hotel room and he's trying to explain that he's just a concerned father figure and that while traveling they may end up... he's at a loss for words at this point, but she quickly supplies one, ""incest.""

I can't even force myself to the finish line. I find the main character desperately dull and Lolita too. I just couldn't care less about either of them. HH is thoroughly unlikeable and not just because he is a paedophile. His narration of the story just makes me want to throw up my last meal. Both are one dimensional characters and the plot I found so boring I was just skim reading pages.Maybe it gets better but I may get hit by a bus tomorrow and life's too short to invest anymore time in this.I'm sorry literature, I've clearly failed you as this is a supposed masterpiece to the rest of the world, but not to me.Oh and I never want to hear or read the word nymphette again for as long as I live.

"892",891,"Tia Katrina Canlas","To be good, character-driven novels need characters in them that are either (a) interestingly relatable to the reader, (b) uniquely interesting, (c) or both.Definitions and Examples:a) Interestingly relatable: Characters that are interestingly relatable have qualities about them that are not specifically extraordinary but are qualities that appeal to the reader by evoking a sense of familiarity and empathy. They are the types of characters that remind you of your friend, your mom, your son, or even your worst enemy, in a very personal way; they are the types of characters that remind you of yourself when you were younger, or the part of yourself that you are proud of, or the part of yourself that embarrasses you. Such characters keep the reader intensely invested in the story’s upcoming downfalls, triumphs, developments, and conclusions.For example, Jonathan Safran Foer’s Oskar (from Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close) is a nine-year-old multilingual, academic, pacifistic, and musical vegan raised in the information age of New York and tragically affected by 9-11; this makes Oskar a character to whom I can relate in an interesting way.b) Uniquely interesting: Characters that are uniquely interesting (unlike the first category of characters that are interesting in the similarities they share with the reader) are interesting because of the unique qualities about them that make them stand out as an individual. The reader lives vicariously through these types of characters.For example, the carefree quirkiness and all-embracing creativity of Andre Breton’s character Nadja is interesting in a unique way.c) Both: And then, there is Superman who is uniquely interesting in that he is an alien from another planet but also relatable to the reader in that his human life is very average in terms of social status, romantic preferences, and creative achievements; what makes Clark Kent interesting is that he leads an average life even though he has superpowers.Lolita:Nobody I know reminds me of the psychopathic narrator or the bratty, apparently seductive, protagonist. As for myself, since I’m (luckily) neither a pedophile nor a nymphet, I cannot in any way relate to Humbert Humbert or Dolores Haze. Hence, for me to have liked ""Lolita"" would entail Nabokov’s depiction of characters that are unique.At first I thought that maybe working in a group home where many of the kids were molested by their stepparents made me jaded; maybe my career normalized pedophilia for me in a way that minimized the story’s affect on me.However, I realized that Nabokov made Lolita’s main characters uninteresting by illustrating other characters just like them. Throughout the book, Humbert Humbert tries to make us believe that he is obsessed with Lolita but still makes sure to tell us that there’s another nymphet here and there and everywhere. Towards the end of the book, we learn about other nymphets that are molested in pornographic orgies. This makes Lolita un-unique and diminishes the tragedy of her lost childhood; also, she’s a brat just like any other kid (but not in a way that reminds the reader of a daughter, or niece, or cousin).Humbert Humbert’s love for Lolita isn’t uniquely interesting either. Clare Quilty is introduced as another man just like Humbert Humbert who wants to fuck Lolita, but in an even creepier way. He has parties, and friends, and pornography.Now that I think about it… I would much rather have read a book that started with Clare Quilty kidnapping Lolita and ended with the brat being kicked out of his place since she would not participate in his attempts at producing kiddie-porn. At least Clare Quilty is a semi-successful playwright with a gregarious personality that attracts multiple sexual partners and fans. He is outspoken and funny, sarcastic and witty. The only thing Humbert Humbert had going for him was his good looks.Unfortunately, Nabokov saved the uniquely interesting Clare Quilty for the end and tortured me with hundreds of pages of Humbert Humbert trying to think of a hundred ways to bribe Lolita into secretly giving him sexual favors.There are many shocking and uncomfortable themes that writers can play with but characterization is very important. Lolita and Humbert Humbert fail as characters in a shocking and uncomfortable relationship.Furthermore, “Lolita” should not be given so much credit just because Nabokov is ESL."

"902",901,"Sharon L","i love Nabokov writing style- it's amazing, so beautifull and the only reason why i was able to read the book. For that I should give it a 5 stars. the thing is- The story is aweful, and after seeing so many ravishing reviews I can't bring myself to give it 5 stars when the content is what it is. yes, a story doesn't have to be good (talking about good MC and heroic story), the main character dowsn't have to be likeable. many times more, a story should make you feel shivers, cold, to open your eyes to some sort of reality you prefered not to see. A great author would use a story to challenge your beliefes, and Nabokov achieved all that and more. and yet, I can't bring myself to give it 5 stars because despite all it's QUALITY (that I state each and every time I speak with someone on the book) I need to show that I wasn't fooled. and that for Dolores it was an expirence that destroyed her life, I need to show that I'm aware. and that 1 star represent exactly that for me.I hated the story, the self justified humbert that at first hides the monster he is. the way he tried to describe his sick attraction to Dolores as love i felt chills. i wasn't fooled. when he described Dolores and him as a happy couple, pretending she had the power in their relationship. i wasn't fooled. i wanted to know how she felt. her contempt was clear, the fact that she was scared, was clear. Nabokov really is a genius creating a charcter like humbert, that's able to fool many pepole including himself- with sobs and pity stories, regrets, self justification, and blaming- as if it was she that tempted him! i cried, hurt and was scared for Dolores. i remember how horrified i was when he played with thought of getting her pregnent so she could give birth to a new Lolita for him. i hate this books, it makes me cold, afraid, sending chills of disgust. but the writing, oh, the writing...it's glorious. and Nabokov is a master at deception, humbert is so vivid, so real, it's terrifing."

And people naturally choose if it's their best read or their worst. Unfortunately, i'm on the negative side. It took me 5 days and so to read and grasp it and hoped i didn't caught interest in reading this before those days. I had some classes before regarding sexual preferences and this story of pedophilia is under the category of psychosexual disorder not limited to a sexual disorder.I was open minded reading this but it bores me in many ways. And all i did was.. shake my head.;)Note: 2014I'm okay with the pedophilia plot but it doesn't have any charm associated with it. The intensity maybe was dragged by too much wordplay."

"975",974,"Jared Hempel","This read was a necessary lesson in both the valuing of my own intuition and the dialing-down of reverence for ""the hype"".I'd seen this book plastered all over ""Best of"" lists—pushed as the pinnacle of aesthetic writing, a classic of classics, “The only convincing love story of our time”. Hah. After about an entire week of slogging through its 317 pages of numbingly digressive, tediously cryptic, and purposeless prose, I am honestly shocked that anyone could hold this work in high regard.Now, I've read a decent amount of reviews and there seem to be two main points of validation:1) ""The 'Unreliable Narrator' is perfectly embodied to the point that the reader will sympathize with the main character, a pedophile.""Haha, no. A tragic backstory can only seek to explain, never excuse. The very notion of having sympathy towards a character that ultimately enslaves, rapes, and siphons the life from a 12-year old girl is simply unfathomable to me. 2) ""L'écriture! C'est magnifique, un chef-d'œuvre!""Sure? I can admit that Nabokov's grasp of the English language was, at times, absolutely mesmerizing. However, when it is spent, for the vast majority of the book, drowned in the sickeningly-obsessive, lusting mind of a 38 year-old pedophile, it all falls apart for me. All-in-all, if you align with the idea, contrary to Nabokov, that fiction can contain both aesthetic AND cerebral content, then I would recommend avoiding this book entirely. There is nothing offered other than an irredeemably dark portrait of a pedophile, clever wordplay, and weightless words. Do not be fooled by the ""established"" critics like I was. There are so many better books to read, from actually-engaged minds."

I had to read this book for class, and with its reputation I might have read it without being forced to. But now that I know that everyone who boasts about this book has never actually read it, that it's not about a young prostitute or young love but a young girl who is tricked, seduced, raped, and ruined by a middle aged monster. While the literary merit of this novel could possibly be argued if you take emotion out of the reading, it is quite impossible for me to do so because in order to read fiction one must attach emotion. It's just too disgusting, as a female, to read this because even if it is fiction, this sick fuck Nabokov did come up with it, even if it's just fantasy aren't we as readers given the right to say your fantasy is sick and twisted?The back cover gives a quote from Vanity Fair as ""the only convincing love story of our century.""

"1041",1040,"Kavity","It was a painful affair, a horridly painful affair, reading about Humbert Humbert's fantasies of nymphets and his particularly perennial obsession with Lolita. And, therein, perhaps, lies the writer's victory - in having been able to depict in torrid imagery, the vulgarities of the protagonist's thoughts. As to those readers who have, over the years, interpreted this story as one of twelve year old Lo bewitching this old ass Humbert, I can only ask you to go back and read the book again, keeping in mind that Lo was ""twelve years old"" when this happened. As for me, I truly believe this book was not only a waste of my time, but also a drain on my mental capacities. And I can only attribute completing this book to my own obsession to not leaving books unfinished. Agreed that it is very well written prose, but the mental strain of reading something bordering on porn is a huge price to pay for very well written prose."

I will definitely read more of his work and maybe even reread this someday... eh probably not. I like the premise of Humbert addressing his readers as his jury, but as his jury I absolutely loath him and couldn't enjoy his beautiful language or whatever. He was too vile a narrator to let myself get swept away in his tale of ""love"". I dragged my feet through this novel but will enjoy the future discussions I have with others who have also read Lolita."

"
"1101",1100,"Elle","This book disturbs me so much more this time around than when I read it in high school. Its rating is based on my emotional response to it, not Nabokov's craftsmanship, which remains diabolically clever. Nabokov employs vivid language to bring to life the narrator's lust for 12-yr-old Lolita, detailing how he first plots, plans and steals his pleasure, then how he becomes her guardian and ""has"" her. It reveals offhandedly the ways he subjugates her, making her earn ""the hard and nauseous way"" every treat her heart desires, the endless presents with which he tries to buy her love and cooperation--in essence the whole twisted and ultimately unsatisfying nature of his love and his dawning realization of what his love has done to her. The role of consumerism and the material struck me in their role as context, attempted bargain in exchange for her innocence and in the very culture's culpability in commodifying her sexuality from that young age. ""One day I removed from the car and destroyed an accumulation of teen-magazines. You know the sort. Stone Age at heart, up to date, at least Mycenan, as to hygiene."" Nabokov suggests the culture itself taught Lolita, little Dolores Haze, the role she was given as commodity, as property, as mirage and as dupe. ""She believed with a kind of celestial trust, any advertisement or advice that appeared in Movie Love or Screen Land.... The words 'novelties and souvenirs' simply entranced her by their trochaic lilt.... She it was to whom ads were dedicated: the ideal consumer, the subject and object of every foul poster."" The book's point-of-view puts the reader in the place of the pedophile and the consumer, asking us to see the world and Lolita through his eyes, making us voyeurs complicit in treating her as object and challenging us to feel sympathy for the predator as much as for his prey. In this manner, it's as courageous an undertaking as it is an uncomfortable one, even if one gets the sense that Nabokov is toying with us as Humbert toys with Lolita. "

It was later translated by its Russian-native author into Russian. The novel is notable for its controversial subject: the protagonist & unreliable narrator, a 37–38-year-old literature professor, Humbert Humbert, is obsessed with the 12-year-old Dolores Haze, with whom he becomes sexually involved after he becomes her stepfather. ""Lolita"" is his private nickname for Dolores."" (From Amazon)I know it is supposed to be a classic and while it is well-written I did not care for the characters or the story."

The Stand by Stephen King comes to mind, but that book was over 1200 pages long. You can’t blame me there. This book was so bland, that I questioned my love for reading. With such topic, I find it hard to believe, how can it be anything BUT interesting? Color me surprised. This novel is only about 350 pages long, and all I could think about was: when will this one-dimensional drivel be over? I get it. We are reading about an obsession. But this book is so monotone. So repetitive. It was not interesting. It lacked depth. It lacked revelations. Details. Nothing about it was controversial. In this day and age, nothing about this book surprised me or really changed my view about anything in life. Excuse me for not finding (wonderfully well-written) descriptions of how delectable 12 year olds are, something of great interest to me and my life. All in all, I’m glad I read it, just so I know exactly what to say whenever someone tells me that they thought Lolita is a work of art and one of the greatest books ever written. "

Paragraph after paragraph describing every detail to it's simplest form. The other major turn off about this story is the narrators narcissism; several times throughout the story the Humbert Humbert addressed the reader outside the storyline to discuss his effect on the ladies. It was a reach for me to identify with the main character on any level. Bouts of mental illness that the narrator/main character experienced throughout the book made it difficult for me to decipher reality from his delusions. You can imagine how this element contributed to the readability of this story. In conclusion: a slow, perverted, hard to read fictional story meant to be read as a memoire by a pedophiliac narcissist. The end. "

"1158",1157,"Azra","The writer knows his job, his thoughts and sayings are very good and he knows how to represent bad and unlogical things in his favour but I just couldnt deal with the fact that he is somehow sexually harassing 12 year old girl, because under all circumstances that's what it is. That was enough for me :)"
"1159",1158,"aRee","Mungkin karena buku ini sedianya berasal dari jaman yang berbeda dimana kata-katanya amat penuh dengan simbol dan deskripsi hal-hal yang nggak gw pahami, jadilah saya sering melompat-lompat dari halaman ke halaman berikut.Singkat ceritanya...gak paham...apa karena terlalu sastra utk otak dan selera saya yang modern? ;P Entahlah...Pastinya, ada banyak perbincangan mengenai buku ini dengan semua penghargaan yang katanya pernah diterima dan kontroversi yang dia timbulkan. Harapan saya agak tinggi waktu membaca buku ini. Seperti salah satu buku karangan anak bangsa yang membuat saya melihat banyak hal yang saya tidak bisa pahami pada pilihan menjadi penyuka sesama jenis. Yah...menurutku Lolita gak sedikitpun kasi pengaruh seperti itu.Seperti yang saya lihat di salah satu review (Natalie kalo ga salah), dia benar2 mendeskripsikan pemikiran saya. Tidak ada ambigu moral setelah membaca buku ini, kesimpulannya tetap: Humbert 'sakit'. Lolita tidak mencintai Humbert dan yang dia lakukan pada Lolita, terserah dia bilang dia cinta, adalah pemerkosaan. Anak sekecil itu belum mengerti dan dia memanfaatkan itu. Dia menahan Lolita, membatasi pergaulannya dan..kapanpun dia ingin, he just do that to her. Gak peduli dia sakit, gak peduli dia nangis. Mengerikan...dan di review buku dibilang ini adalah salah satu novel terbaik sepanjang masa?? Aduh..."

"1162",1161,"Ashlie","I actually didn't finish Lolita... yes, the writing was beautiful, but it just wasn't my thing. I just felt more and more uncomfortable getting deeper and deeper into that creep's head. I'm all for freedom of speech and there's little I hate more than censorship, so go Nabokov... I'm just not going to read it."
"1167",1166,"Doreen Cenci","I never stop reading a book even when i hate it. But this book...ugh! I was able to put aside the inappropriate and rather disturbing subject matter, but I found Humbert obsessive to the point of annoyance. There were some times where i felt sympathy for him. He obviously never moved on from losing his first childhood love, Annabel. I loved how Nabokov used Poe's Annabel Leigh poem as his inspiration. Also I enjoyed Nabokov's dark sense of humor especially when Humbert would speak about Charlotte or plan or demise. I really wanted to like this book and even as I type out my review I think maybe I will try to continue. As of now, I am walking away."
"1170",1169,"Sammy Nicholas","I had to read this for class, and I didn't get passed the second chapter of Part 2. There was a whole bunch of unneeded details or details that got redundant because they had been previously mentioned. So basically the book is about a PEDOPHILE who falls on love with this girl Annabel when he is also a boy, and forever only likes young girls, even though he is no longer a boy. He marries a woman who cheats on him and then divorces, he calls young girls that remind him of Ana nymphet, which are young girls between the ages of 10-14 that are just experiencing the brushes of womanhood. Then he meets Lolita, marries her mom, Charlotte, to stay close to her, and then they travel the U.S. Lolita eventually grows sick of him and runs away, and finally he realizes that his sick perverted self cost Lolita her childhood. It is a long book, and it is pretty hard to get through and the language is confusing. It is not worth the time, and if you have to read it Sparknotes is your best option. The characters were alright, but a lot of them were alike, which I realize is a common theme throughout the book, and it just made the characters all run together. If you have the option, don't read this book, it is awful."
"1173",1172,"Katie Wallbom","I picked up this book, not really knowing what it was about, but hey it's a ""classic"" and must be good. I hated it. I kept reading, hoping that there would be some point. When I finished, I promptly threw it in the trash. I don't feel bad about it either & I love books.What happens in this book? Older man sleeps with a child, they drive around the country, and she ends up barefoot and pregnant in a hovel. The end."

But this was like sifting through a dumpster from a fast food restaurant in order to find a quarter. Yuck.I didn't miss the point. It's written from the viewpoint of a pedophile. He knows he is evil, he knows this is all wrong, but I decided with a little prodding from the Spirit, that I didn't need to be dragged through all his twisted ideas. Why descend to hell if you don't have to?"
"1201",1200,"Zahra Hassan","if it deserve a star is for the fluency of the story, other wise its a story of a paedophil trying to gain the world sympathy by convincing them it was the poor Lolita- who was crying for help all over the story - seduced him first and it was for her he became criminal at last.and it gives every paedophilic a reason to continue destroying many childrens life by calling this story ( a classic )"

"1204",1203,"Candace Larson","Although I admit the book was written beautifully, I was never able to get over the subject matter. I generally dislike reading a narrator with zero redeemable qualities. I pushed through because it is on virtually every top 100 books-to-read list and because it came very highly recommended. I was ready to stop 20 pages in and, while it did get easier, I still felt dirty and gross. One critic called this book ""the only convincing love story of our century""--I disagree. It is about obsession, justification, greed, and the dismissal of human decency.I may be considered a prude or perhaps I missed the point of the novel. Regardless, I'm giving this book one star because I disliked reading every page."
"1205",1204,"Mason Thomas","It took my awhile to write a review on this book because I really needed to digest what it was I had read. I hated this book. I absolutely hated this book. I love books that show man's decent and ultimate fall, but I just couldn't get past the pedophilia part. The description of his deep mental perversion for nymphets was just too much for me to read. It was disgusting, which I guess means the author was successful. I wrote on my American Psycho review that Easton Ellis wrote a book that was gorgeous but grotesque and it wouldn't be right for everyone. That is what Lolita was like for me. I respect the book for what it is but would not recommend it to anyone and would never dream of taking a second look at it."
"1208",1207,"Patricia O'Brien","It's well written but does that make it a good book? Vladimir Nabokov may know how to string words together but the cold hearted misogynistic stories he writes just make me want to throw his books across the room. I was alternately bored and appalled by the intellectual sniveling of Humbert. If I wasn't forced to read Lolita and Pale Fire for a class I wouldn't have bothered with them. What a waste of time. "
"1210",1209,"Mae-Lynn","I'm into controversial subject matter in books, so I thought I'd love Lolita. Nope. I was bored. I didn't like the writing style. It just wasn't what I expected at all.

A really talented author.Furethemore I was quite disturbed by the context and the similarity of the whole storyline, it was quite a boring read, the only reason I kept going was with the hope it picks up and the vocabulary. I have heard so many good things about this book but it did not fulfill my expectations."
"1220",1219,"Lizzie","I honestly cannot understand how or why on earth this bizarre book has been labelled as a 'modern classic'. Perhaps I am missing something, but this is one of the most awful books I have ever had to read! The language is far from poetic; it is utterly ridiculous, and the characters are thoroughly unbelievable and unrealistic. "
"1226",1225,"Ann Single","Nabokov says Lolita tackles one of three American taboos. Personally, I wish he'd used his considerable talent to write about a mixed race marriage or a successful atheist. It's hard to smile along with Humbert when I can hear a child sobbing in the background. I don't buy Humbert's remorse and think the author has a disturbing lack of compassion for Lolita who is not some siren-like creature. She's a little girl who is most horribly abused."

El principio del libro... es atrapante. A mí me dejó mal. Pero después sentí verdadero horror. Ya, quizá sigo siendo muy pechoña. Quizá lo intente después, pero por ahora una sola estrella, y no solo por el comportamiento pervertido (jaja), sino que porque, durante lo que alcancé a leer me pareció solamente eso, el retrato de una obsesión... nada más que eso. El largo relato de una obsesión. No hay mayor gracia en eso, me da la impresión. No encontré lecturas secundarias.Lo intentaré de nuevo más adelante. La tercera es la vencida (y si no, filo)."

"1291",1290,"Acer Pseudoplantatus","My only reason for forcing myself to read Nabokov's Lolita was the recommendation and praise for it by a very good friend of mine, who had made me aware of Julian Barnes (a now favourite writer of mine).Her description had raised high expectations that were disappointed greatly. I wanted to like the book, I tried to like it and I continued to hope for some redeeming qualities while I was reading. But I couldn't. I can't stand it. Not a single bit; not a single aspect of it. And never has a book annoyed me so much.I'll discuss the style  first, since with this book it is style over substance and this style is being praised as beautiful, great and even genius even by many of those giving the book bad reviews. The way I see it, the style is neither; Language-wise, even though there are a few beautiful descriptions, the writing is decorative, hollow, pretentious (incredibly so), self indulgent, weightless in the bad sense, overwrought, smug, self regarding and sterile; a miserable failure at an attempt of being poetic not for artistic reasons but for appearing cultured and erudite. The style of the narrative  is repetitive, rambling, tedious, chaotic (switching between first and third person, in the beginning it was often unclear whom he spoke of) and unreliable (I still cannot understand, why some people seem to be so fond of unreliable narrators). Certainly the ""mastery"" of language displayed (word-plays, literary devices and so on) is impressive (especially when considering that English it is Nabokov's third language),however to me it is mere technical linguistic wanking,meaningless for the most part; eloquent without saying anything. I find neither beauty nor artistic validity or valuable essence in this technical exercise. Content -wise it is the attempt of Humbert Humbert to convince the reader that he, despite having raped a 12-year-old over and over, being a psychopath who degrades and objectifies women and a manipulative murderer he is actually a good guy. And not just a good guy, but a victim of ""demons"" (that disgusting and deluded ""nymphette"" concept as well as stating that he was ""seduced"", despite an failed attempt to drug and rape Dolores), that his objectification and abuse (what I mean here is not just the rape but the abusive relationship; isolation, control and so on) of a child are love and that being a paedophile he is aesthetically ahead of the curve for being able -unlike most men- to identify ""nymphettes"". Oh, and he's oh so tortured. And through all that he is condescending, degrading, often repeating how great he looks, how cultured he is and how he could have any woman. The excessive use of French again seems like an effort to appear cultured; not wanting to communicate any other idea but his own ""greatness"". But wait, it gets worse; he is one of the most flat,one-dimensional characters I've ever encountered. There is noting more to him than narcissism, occasional self-irony (yet not nearly enough to be redeeming in any way) and paedophilia. An abhorrent story presented or should I rather say distorted by an narcissistic psychopath. In conclusion ; I consider Lolita overrated rubbish; .a unjustifiably glorified (well crafted) piece of shit. The only way I can explain to myself that this book has become a classic and is so highly regarded, is that critics love(d) the pretentiousness and shock value and most readers are afraid of being called philistines or prudes. How someone at Vanity Fair can write that it is ""The only convincing love story of our century"" is beyond me; having not read the article I only hope that it was a sarcastic mockery, that the publisher mistook for praise, for it is neither convincing nor in any way about love.

"1293",1292,"Anja","DNF at 55%This is a first. I just dnf'd an audiobook. This has never happened before...Why the hell is this a classic? Because some guy said so? Because of the oh so beautiful writing style? Why?No, don't bother. I don't give a flying fig, tbh.This book is just awful. It's boring, tedious, verbose, and pretentious. And the main character is nothing more than a perverted asshole who never owns up to being a perverted asshole. All he does is justifying himself.Ugh. Ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh. Ugh."
"1297",1296,"lafon حمزة نوفل","Amazing writing. Incredibly vivid description. And yet I did not like it. Perhaps this is because I know that I am not secure in my own understanding of the world.

"1350",1349,"Libby","OK I want to preface this entry with this statement: I don't usually give up on books before I finish them. In fact I can only remember two books that I chose to not finish reading out of the many thousands I have read in my lifetime. This will be the third. I have failed to complete the book, and for once I really dont care. I have not an ounce of guilt or regret over not finishing it. Why did this book cause such an extreme reaction in me? a) I found Nabokov's writing style flowery and pretentious. In my opinion it was overwritten.b) The parts that were supposed to be comic I found to be only disturbing and nauseating.c) HH's deluded concept of ""nymphettes"" made me cringe with a disgust that I could not overcome.d) HH sad belief that what he was experiencing for Lolita was ""love"" was a laughable concept to me.Perhaps this novel can be called a classic by those who find quality in Nabokov's writing style and who can see layers of depth in such things as metaphors for the old and new worlds of Russia and America. However, I like to call a spade a spade and all academic posturing aside it is quite simply about how a vain and manipulative misogynist paedophile attempts to justify his sickness to the world...and that to me does not classic literature make. It makes my skin crawl to think about how this novel is probably held as a true classic in the paedophile world. "

The authenticy of this story is ruined by the prelude, which is in the same unusual yet creative style of the rest of the book, yet ""supposedly"" written by other people. I'd read the prelude last if I were you! As for the story, many have said you can sympathise with the character, I however felt I was being manipulated as a reader as much as the writer manipulates his victims, and not once did I feel sympathy. Pity possible, but not sympathy!! The book kind of drifts in and out, the middle is very tedious to read, but the beginning and end are good to read, although I did find myself drifting off occasionally, however when I came back into the story I realised I hadn't missed much!"

I know that the style is to show how Humbert wants to convince the reader he is a good man and that his feelings for Lolita are real despite her age, but it was just to long winded and round about for me. There were times I just wanted to yell get to the point why do I need ten pages to describe something and why do you need to stop and tell me why you are describing it in detail. The story itself I think is an amazing look into the mind of a pedophile and how they justify what they do. But I just wish he could have done it with less words. Maybe in time I will appreciate the writing style but as I write this review that isn't the case. "

Vladimir's use of words is unnaturally beautiful considering the content of the story, and he vividly captures Humbert's feelings and emotions. However, I could not find it in myself to enjoy this novel or find it pleasurable to read. Despite the eloquent writing I found myself wishing the story would end, just so I no longer had to keep reading the perverted and disturbing musings of the narrator. Whilst this may of been Nabokov's intention, this is not what I look for in a 'good' book. However, I understand that others may feel differently. "

It is divine and artful prose, some of the most masterful writing I've encountered. BUT, I have to sheepishly admit that I didn't really know what I was getting into. I knew that Lolita chronicles an affair between a middle-aged man and an underage girl. I didn't know beforehand that the girl was 12 years old. So, from the very beginning, I felt deep repulsion (as Nabokov intends -- after all Humbert describes himself as a freak and a monster). Now, I am no prude when it comes to literature. I recognize that there is much that can be learned by seeking to understand human failings, cruelty, and ugliness. So the fact that Humbert is a twisted pedophile is not where I find fault with this book. What is inexcusable to me is Nabokov's reprehensible depiction of the predator's impact (or lack thereof) on Lolita herself. Nabokov portrays Lolita as flirtatiously complicit in the seduction, which is not utterly unbelievable, as there are indeed precocious 12-year-olds in the world. But then Lolita somehow floats above the horrific ravages of protracted sexual abuse, unscathed. She seems to suffer little emotional trauma, and ultimately, after being the target of two sexual predators, manages to find a stable, though not ideal, marital relationship. This is thoroughly beyond credibility. The devastating effects of pedophilia on its victims is beyond dispute, and I have witnessed that effect on a few women in my acquaintance. To allow Lolita to blithely move on after being a child sex toy is a grotesque disservice to women who suffer the abuse of actual predators. I suspect that my reaction is all the stronger because I am the father of a 12-year-old myself. As I was reading Humbert's lurid accounts of the pleasures of statutory rape, I couldn't help but wonder how many mentally imbalanced people had been influenced by this book to consider taking that pleasure to themselves. If even one child became a victim of a would-be Humbert as a result of this ""classic,"" it would not be worth whatever literary value it might have added to the world. If that 12-year-old daughter was your own, I can't imagine you disagreeing. On the other hand, if Nabokov had at least given us a realistic view into the distortion, confusion, and chaos that would have attended a real Lolita as a result of her abuse, I might change my opinion about this book. When I read about a flawed protagonist, I want to end the book feeling sympathy toward him or her at the same time that I feel deepened sorrow for their mistakes. With Lolita, I somehow finished the book feeling the opposite: I was completely cold toward the protagonist, and - to my horror - found that my revulsion toward his pedophilia had somehow dulled. That is not a contribution worth the pages it is printed on, no matter how elevated the prose. "

Même si le style est intéressant, le contenu est à mes yeux parfaitement repoussant. J'ai eu l'impression de lire les mémoires de Marc Dutroux, à travers un personnage plaintif et larmoyant sur lequel j'étais apparemment sensé m'apitoyer. Mais on parle quand même d'un vieux pervers qui kidnappe et viole une jeune fille de douze ans ! Je ne comprends vraiment pas comment on peut apprécier cette histoire et ressentir de l'empathie pour le personnage de Humbert Humbert ou même trouver la moindre trace romanesque dans cet opus. Je le range gentiment à côté des 120 jours de Sodome, même écrin stylistiquement parfait mais au contenu immonde."

As such I wish I could rate this ""I hated it"" instead of merely ""didn't like it"". I read it because I'm working through the world classics' little by little. It is indeed a fascinating psychological study of a disgusting, filthy, cowardly and deluded pedophile. A sad love story, sure, in the same way that date rape is consensual sex.Any identification or sympathy in any way shape or form for Humbert is only possible if you fall for his manipulations and/or you are clueless enough or ignorant about the life-time effects of this abuse on victims of pedophiles. To have sympathy for Humbert is the same as having sympathy for Ted Bundy or the BTK killer. At least they put an end to the suffering of their victims. Humbert's murder of Lolita's soul will endure as daily torture for as long as she lives. "

Indeed, I still don't know what to make of most of the novel, other than to say this:I believe this book is only a classic because it is shocking. Nabokov's writing is drearily detail-heavy, and his language becomes florid at the most odd of times. The novel could have been a great deal shorter, but Nabokov seemed to like the sound of his narrator's voice. And as for Humbert's justifications for his attraction to pre-pubescent Dolores Haze, I can only say that they are flimsy at best and yet Nabokov presents them as eerily concrete convictions worthy of consideration. I was left, as I said, cold and numb after the completion of this novel. I don't see why it is a classic, and I now view it as a kind of gauntlet I had to survive in order to really say that I am open to reading any kind of literature.

"1527",1526,"Susan  Odetta","Brad picked this up from the ""banned books"" bin featured at the Hilo Public Library. He read it and urged me to do so. I can understand why the book was banned in 1955; the protagonist is a preferencial pedophile. The book is written from the pedophile's point of view in excruciating detail of that mindset, and herein lies the problem. His view is predictably disgusting and eventually boringly so. There seemed to be no point to the story...period. By about 1/3 through, I wished fervently for someone to kill him off.....it didn't happen. Reading this was a completely distasteful waste of time and I finished the damn book swearing at my husband for suggesting that I read it. The book, had it not been banned, might have simply bored the readers to death in 1955 and then it would not have become such a big lasting deal for so many decades since. I recommend ""don't bother"". "
"1528",1527,"Mila Zuliana","*pants*I’m not cut for this stuff.I had such a hard time finishing this book, and I can’t say that I enjoyed it. If this book was a movie, I would probably keep nodding my head off in my seat and keep being elbowed by something that says that I’ve bought the damn ticket so I’d better go through it with my eyes open.Now, listen, I’m not bashing and saying that this book is a bad work, because, hell no! It is beautiful. It is a work of majestic (and somewhat lewd) art. And if it was a movie, it would be an Oscar winner movie, the one everyone raves about but nobody completely understands (by nobody of course I meant myself, please don’t get offended).It’s not the theme (the controversial theme of pedophilia) that made me have a difficult time enjoying the book. I mean, the first reason I wanted to read this book was because I like me some age difference relationship (lol). It’s one of my secret kinks (well, not so secret anymore now), and, it’s Lolita! An icon. Sure I had to read it. But then my intelligence is not yet on this level of genius (and to be honest I feel sorry for myself, because it makes me seem uneducated, but whatever). It was like visiting an art gallery, full of brilliant works, and I was just staring and nodding with a serious face but actually thinking, “What the hell am I doing here?”This book is full with beautiful words and difficult ones too. I don’t think my vocabulary covered them all. Nabokov used a lot of French which I know nothing about. I wish I can comment on it more here but to be perfectly honest I was extremely out of the loop. I kept groping blindly through my way, and when I finally saw the light at the end of tunnel, I couldn’t be more grateful.This book is wonderful and all, but I just didn’t enjoy reading it. I guess I should stick with my average reading materials and stop pretend to be smart, lol."

It is full with word games that are impressive given that the author is no native speaker, but are rather annoying for the reader. Actually some chapters are down right torture. The characters stay flat through the whole story. To be honest I had to put the book away after about half or 60 percent.

"1581",1580,"Miranda-Hermione","Okay, okay, I get it. Great literature, timeless classic, elevates the flawed hero into an art form, blah, blah, blah. But seriously, Mr. Nabokov, would it have killed you to come up with a more believable plot? I've read better fanfiction than what you came up with. It's not just the pedophilia, although 200+ pages detailing how irresistible little girls can be--and how Humbert Humbert goes about acting on that desire--is not exactly my idea of a pleasurable read. I can see what Nabokov was trying to do here. He's trying to create the most despicable character he can come up with (Humbert Humbert, bohemian pedophile extraordinaire) and, through perspective and slanted writing, turn him into a sympathetic character. And he almost pulls it off. Just not quite. Humbert can plead all he wants about his feelings and his reasons and his situation. I just wasnn't buy it. What I could tell was supposed to come off as persuasive, to draw the reader in, merely served to push me farther away from the novel. By the end, I would happily have burned every copy of the book I could lay my hands on.It is, admittedly, a very interesting concept for Nabokov to have tried. I applaud him for managing to write this book. I just wish I hadn't had to read it. On the other hand, I can attest that this book will stick in my brain for a very, very long time. "

This is not one of them. Not only was my first impression total indifference, but every time I've felt tempted to dip into it since I've been immediately repelled by the artificial, uninspired, unconvincing prose - the type of watered-down and kitsched-up Poe-isms that I excise immediately from extreme embarrassment when they appear in my own writing. Not only that, but my reasons for picking the thing up again are never deeply-felt, just a kind of exasperated 'OK I'll take another look' whenever I'm reminded how many people who otherwise share my tastes seem to revere it. But f**k that - this sucks. When I read Kafka at nineteen, OK, I didn't get it, but it haunted me, and one glance at Metamorphosis a few years later was enough to convince me.

I spent most of the book wanting to take revenge on Humbert.The disturbing thing about this book is the way so many readers uncritically believe the words of an unrepentant child molester because his is the voice the novel is narrated from.

Overall, I came to believe this book has survived on its shock value alone but that's not enough for me to deem it an important literary piece. Mr. Nabokov's ""brilliant wordplay"" or prose lacks what I call- a life. A book can't haunt you if it never had a life to begin with. Lolita is one of those... I don't see myself ever going back to quote it someday, or longing to read it once more, or telling others of its message, or recognizing the influence its had on my perspective.

"1780",1779,"Nicole ","I know this is a classic, but I couldn't get through it. It wasn't even the subject matter of a man rambling on about his obsession for 7th graders, it was the rambling. I thought the writing was horrible, badly constucted and I couldn't handle it."

"1791",1790,"Amber Koppenhofer","Long, laborious ribbons of unnecessary narrative make for a beautifully written but boring story of one man's obsession with a girl far to young for him. Nabokov no doubt has a way with words, but his tedious descriptions did not keep my attention. Making words into art does not disguise this pathetic tale of pedophilia. I almost didn’t finish listening to it. I nearly gave up numerous times. The main character is simply unlikable, not only because he is a pedophile, but because he is a pompous ass. The only redeeming thing about this audiobook is that it is narrated by Jeremy Irons. If you like long arduous accounts of characters and landscapes, if you are a fan of poetry, and if you don’t mind reading about a man’s lust for a little girl, then maybe this is the book for you, but for me, I will be happy to delete the files from my MP3 player and never revisit this novel again."

“There is no other bliss on earth comparable to that of fondling a nymphet.”
I'm not quite sure what to say about this book. On one hand, the topic is so perverted and sickening, but on the other, it's quite possibly the most beautifully written piece of literature I've ever come across.The plot disgusted me; it was about a fully-grown man being attracted to and abusing a little girl. But Nabokov's writing was absolutely incredible.
“Can you remember,” she said, “what was the name of that hotel, you know [nose pucketed], come on, you know—with those white columns and the marble swan in the lobby? Oh, you know [noisy exhalation of breath]—the hotel where you raped me.”

"1822",1821,"Carie","I have a hard time understanding why this is a classic. The writing style was lovely, but I found nothing in the story that moved me --- at no point during the read did I become engrossed in the story. This is why it took me a month to read and why when I finished it I ran around the house celebrating finally getting to move on to a (hopefully) more transporting book. As a secondary note, I find the summaries of this book and blurbs intended to entice the reader entirely misleading. Can't we just have an honest advertisement --- it is a story about obsession and pedophilia and how a wretched adult justifies abusing a child."
"1824",1823,"Rachel Arens","i couldn't keep reading...i kept thinking that it must have a redemptive ending because i've heard people like this book, but i just couldn't even get to the end. "
"1835",1834,"Johanna H.","The book was very hard even impossible for me to rate because of the challenging topic. I can't make me like this.. Even though i was deeply disturbed i continued reading the book thinking (or hoping) to find the turning point which would make me like this, make me like the narrator, feel sympathy for him or forget for even a second what a horrible, perverse, life wrecking and dirty old man he was. I tried to find the masterwork classic that everyone was talking about. I didn't find it. I must admit that the author was very good in twisting the word to his use, he wrapped this story in gold with his witty and poetic language. But under this wrapping it was was it was..The narrator was a paedophile who married a woman to get near her preteen daughter, who ""kidnapped"" this said daughter and raped her every night while she cried herself to sleep thinking that he was asleep. Who hit her because he thought she flirted with boys her age, abused and controlled her. Even though the author sometimes overshadowed this part of the story it was still there under the surface. The story wasn't told in a obscene way, there were not much details but that doesn't mean they weren't there. Oh and the irony at the end. Everyone who read the book will know what i'm talking about. It was an insight into the mind of a sick man and it disturbed me deeply.. I couldn't see this as just a novel, no because it really happens, everywhere in the world. The word Lolita is now even used as a term. Our media is full of it and even if they don't know the book everyone will know the famous Lolita. The picture of a Lolita will be different for me from now on. There was nothing romantic here, Lolita didn't wanted it she always said it was rape and Humbert Humbert (a fantastic name, right?) was a sick perverted man who had a poetic way of speaking which couldn't distract from the sick things he said and the crimes he committed. Since the times this book was published our world has changed a lot. We live in a digital world now and our society has so much information at hand with just a click. The whole world is connected and we can educate ourselves about every topic wherever and whenever we want. Cases of child abuse come up daily in the news and we know a lot more on how to avoid things like this.. But it still happens to often. We know now a lot more on how children get affected by it too. If the book came out today it would probably be out of Lolitas sight. I don't think it would become a classic today too. People nowadays will see the story probably different from then. And i'm sure that everyone even if they loved this book and gave it five stars know how sick Humberts behaviour was.But i think the problem that many people have here is that we don't want to believe that people who do things like this are normal humans like us. We can't imagine them doing everyday things like everyone, having a normal work, we don't want to imagine them as teachers, office worker or going grocery shopping . It is easier to think of them as evil people through and through. It is a revolting thought for us that EVERYONE could be a child abuser. But this book challenged this belief. Humbert is not just a paedophile, he is an intelligent man he writes poesie, can speak several languages, he even loves Lolita in his own weird way which must be something good, right? He wants to control her yes but he wants to protect her too. He abuses her but he is somehow a father figure for her too.We see the world through his eyes and maybe that is the answer to that.Maybe that makes it hard for us to believe that he is evil and the things he does are wrong. We should not forget that he sees the world different too. No one else would say that a eleven year old flirted with him. But he does.. Maybe he just interpreted it like he wanted it to. We must not forget that Lolita was twelve years old and he turned into this kind of sick twisted father figure for her. Trying to drug her, rape her. There was NO consent to this and she did NOT enjoy what he did to her. She lost her mother and had nowhere to go. She even believed that he killed her mother (which he did in some way). She was a child and he took everything from her what she needed and turned her into some kind of compliant sex slave.No author, not even Shakespeare himself could justify Humberts actions here. This books is not bad. By no means.. It was a challenging topic and i had to make myself read further many times because it shocked me. I don't there's anyone who reads this book and goes out of it without some questions and things to think over. I can recommend it for people who know what awaits them. It is NOT a love story it is a story about abuse and rape."

"1844",1843,"Norrin2","The intelligentsia mafia will call you a prude if you dare speak heresy about Lolita not being a great book. But there are other reasons to not like this book. Maybe it's just me but when I read fiction I need to have at least one character I can identify with or pull for, and I hate everybody in this book, Lolita, her mom, the pervert with the same first and last name.

I never got into Nabokov's worldview or his language, and just how the hell did Clare Quilty find Lolita initially anyway? Why is Humbert so freaked out about it, since they clearly have similar ends and could meet up? And Lolita barely has a voice here. It's an interesting premise, but reading the book was like chewing on gravel."
"1852",1851,"Aaron Burns","Turgid, pretentious tripe. That Nabokov is a skilled writer seems to be a point he intends to make with every word of this revolting book, which presents a sense of desperation and a lack of humor. It's as if he prepared a wonderfully eloquent cake made of shit, and demands you admire the cake for it's eloquence. Humbert Humbert is a disgusting lecher, and spending time with him is highly unpleasant - as much for his overblown sense of self as his pedophilia. A Platonist might present this as exhibit A in his prosecution against poetry:""What is the redeeming feature of this novel? I'd argue that it is as imbalanced to write with eloquence on the subject of garbage, as to write garbage on the subject of eloquence.""Humbert Humbert is a cynical pedophile who commits the unforgivable sin of being boring.

But I wish I had never read it.Oh sweet Jesus. I absolutely loathed this book.The subject matter was, of course, vile. I feel like I need to go and have a bath in disinfectant, bleach my brain - anything to get this filth off me. But, subject matter aside, this was the most pretentious piece of crap I've read in a long time. Long-winded, at times completely pointless, and God, the parts in French - enough already! The narration style was (to me) absolutely irritating - his incessant talking of himself in the third person (Humbert Humbert), as well as his ridiculous nicknames for *himself*. It was obvious that he was a complete lunatic. He really did not appear to have any remorse for what he had done, or indeed any real acknowledgement that he had done anything 'wrong'. He was obviously trying to endear himself to his 'readers'. Nabokov was obviously very skilled - he's an incredibly memorable character, and quite possibly the only character I despise even more than Joffrey from Game of Thrones. Absolutely no redeeming features or qualities whatsoever. I can't remember a book ever making me feel like this before. That in itself is worth something, I suppose, but I just don't know how to rate this book. I am wavering between one star - because I truly detested it like nothing else - and five stars, because it's clearly a masterful piece of literature.So three stars it is - I'll split the difference. And I would never, never, never recommend this book to anyone. Ever.Edited on 30th June 2015 - down to one star. I hate this book more & more as time passes."

This, combined with Nabokov's very troubling tale of pedophilia, child pornography, and sexual molestation, in which at the very end, the author attempts to not-so-subtly convince his reader that Humbert is the lesser of two evils, makes for a very disappointing book.

As the book goes on, it covers HH's attempts to play Lolita's father. From the sickening joke of marrying the mother to trap the daughter, the ploy is extended to cross all problems. Everything is solved by murder or rape, and the persona's self hatred forces a measure of compassion which the sickening fuckwit does not deserve.The use of french is annoying and the struggle of translating bizarre phases (without using a translator) is the only thing that kept me from setting this book on fire, and crying.To cap, i hate this book and use of flowery detail to escape the actual acts of abuse enrage me to no end.

"1987",1986,"Geoffrey Todd","“Lolita” by the Russian author Vladimir Nabokov, a Russian writing in his third language, was published in 1955. It is set in the USA and is the story of a middle-aged academic “Humbert Humbert” who is exclusively attracted to pre pubescent children aged between 12 and 14. He becomes sexually obsessed with a particular 12 year old girl, Dolores Haze who he nicknames “Lolita”. Humbert contrives to become her stepfather and when subsequently her mother dies suddenly, takes Lolita on a bizarre journey around the USA, raping her in a series of seedy motels. The book is recognised as a “classic” and is for example included on Time’s list of the 100 Best English Novels in the English Language from 1923 to 2005. It appears on school syllabuses but its difficult subject matter is witnessed by the existence of another book advising how it should be “taught”.Nabokov’s portrayal of the central character “Humbert” is that of a paedophile (ICD – 10, World Health Organisation International Classification of Diseases). According to the author, he extensively studied “similar case histories” to fashion the character of his anti-hero. Humbert as a young teenager has a thwarted sexual relationship with a 12 year old, but as he gets older his sexual preferences fail to mature. Subsequently he only ever finds 12 to 14 year old girls sexually attractive but also they must have certain characteristics eg pallor, thinness, brown legs, white ankle socks etc. A real turn on for Humbert is soft downy body hair which he describes in, what is for him, highly erotic detail. He prefers to stay in lodgings beside play grounds to better observe “nymphets” as he calls them. Using textbook paedophile strategy he courts and marries an adult woman whom he finds repulsive, for the sole purpose of gaining access to her 12 year old daughter, Dolores Haze. Humbert evolves a plan to murder the mother but by chance she is killed in an accident. He justifies having sex with a 12 year old with the familiar excuse that in other civilisations it is perfectly acceptable. According to Humbert, “she is asking for it” (of course) and it is she that seduces him rather than he raping her (again, of course). He visits her in the classroom where she is working after school hours and bribes her to jerk him off as he fixates on the narrow pale neck of a “nymphet” sitting in front of them. He exerts both physical and tyrannical emotional control over Lolita, threatening her with all sorts of dire consequences should she tell “their secret” or run away. “I succeeded in terrorising Lo who, despite a certain brash alertness of manner and spurts of wit was not as intelligent a child as her IQ might suggest. But if I manage to establish that background of shared secrecy and shared guilt ………….”. Indeed, Nabokov’s extremely accurate portrayal of the mind and machinations of the paedophile mind is so convincing that it has led some to speculate unsurprisingly that he himself was a closet paedophile, although no such evidence exists.Nabokov’s prose has been much praised, despite his amazing predilection for the use of words that are not commonly or ever used. For example, just now randomly opening the book (honestly), in the space of just a few pages he uses “maquette”, “telestically”, “bemazed”, “nevrotic”, “versimilitude”, “logodaedaly”, “logomancy”, “undinist”, and most ironically “recondite”. There are also frequent lapses into French and for non French speakers, the Penguin edition at least offers no help. Juste ciel, he even exhumes the word “valetudinarian”, which I last came across in Smollett’s “Humphrey Clinker” (1771). Many readers will find the subject matter of this novel dismal and wretched but apparently not the literati. For example “Lolita” is extensively reviewed on Wikipedia with sections entitled “Erotic Motifs and Controversy”, “Style and Interpretation”, “Literary Pastiches Allusions and Prototypes” but the “p” word is avoided absolutely. Perhaps all reviewers of this book need first to sit through a Forensic Medical talk on paedophilia and child abuse. Knowledge of such matters in the early 1950s was minimal but sufficient to make it difficult enough for Nabokov to get his novel published. Over 50 years later there is very much greater and increasing awareness of paedophilia. I suggest that if this novel were now presented to Penguin for publication there would be only two certainties – rejection, quickly followed by a knock on the door from the police. Geoff Todd"

Perhaps, due to the sensitive subject matter, it was revolutionary when originally published; however, I can't understand why it is considered such a classic piece of literature. The term ""lolita"" typically refers to a young girl who is found sexually attractive to older men and the plot follows that definition to a tee. The subject matter is pretty shocking by today's standards, so I can't imagine how audiences perceived it upon release, as I felt Lolita tells a disgusting story about a demented man using beautiful language. It also speaks to a person's inclination to want to explain their actions, as a means of absolution from the crimes commited. "

"2048",2047,"Christina Rau","I didn't actually finish reading Lolita. Going into it, I knew it would be about an older man falling for an underage girl. Still, I didn't realize it would be so, well, CREEPY. I felt like I was becoming one of those teachers on the news who start affairs with their students. This book, simply put, was not for me. It probably shouldn't be for anyone else. I'm not saying it should be censored; I'm saying that it shouldn't be a book anyone labels as their favorite. Just because of the creep factor. Creepy."
"2049",2048,"A. J. McMahon","Glib and superficial, with nothing much to say apart from the narcissistic obsession of the narrator. It is not at all funny, the people are all unpleasant in one way or another, the prose style is largely verbiage and the storyline thoroughly boring. The whole book goes nowhere from beginning to end. Not worth reading."
"2051",2050,"Daniel Brown","DISTURBING. I felt bad during and after reading it."
"2054",2053,"Lynn Hall","Creepy"
"2058",2057,"Penelope","This is Nabokov... And well, by being Nabokov... I must have read it all wrong. This is an endlessly one-dimensional debased love of an old man for a 12 year old teenager. I tried but I could not felt the collide of hyper civilised Europe with the cheerful barbaric postwar American I'm sure literary critics found myriad reasons that I just don’t happen to see at all. This is grooming and rape.The thematic defense for this book, as it has nothing to offer, except the absurd tale of a weathered old pervert man ogling young girls and choosing one who epitomises his unacceptable desires. Eventually, he has his way with her, completely controlling her young body and mind-f******* a little beautiful teenage. This is a book about a grown man’s obsession and his fornication with a 12 year old girl. And nothing more. "
"2062",2061,"Chrysta","Oh no, this is not what I was hoping for at all. Flower speech going on and on and on about innocence and peach fuzz. This seemed more about a creepy guy trying to vindicate himself then a story about a young siren sexy and coy... Really, it was just boring."
"2064",2063,"Anca Stratulat","Disgusting!!! The journal of a pedophile.."
"2066",2065,"Crossword","Aburridoooooo."
"2076",2075,"Lance McMurchy","While this book was never going to be a I would really like, being book about a narcissistic professor sexual relationship with a twelve year girl (having a 9 year old daughter doesn't help). And even though the book being a comedy, a paradox, and may be a few other things -- it did not shirk the morally repugnant consequences of such behaviour. Interesting. So I have to say: It was a strange book. You would think the author would have a sick mind, but I don't think that is the case. He is just describing what is -- and, in some Wittgenstein way -- opening up the issue of pedophilia to public scrutiny. I only topic I can think it relates would be that of suicide; being one of those topics we as a society don't want to talk about (particularly in the late 1950's). And this is why it is seen as a classic. Not because it is a great book; But because Nabokov is opening up a Pandora's box by using comedy to describe a taboo topic.Classics are classics because they are, somehow, special. Not because they are necessarily great works of literature. So I have learnt. "
"2080",2079,"Cindy R","It may be a classic to some people but I hated it. I suffered through to the bitter end hoping for some redemption or clarity and found none. I couldn't wait to be done with having to listen to the narrator's ceaseless, self-obsessed whining and endless self-pity over losing Lolita and having to deal with a society that doesn't understand his need to be a pedophile. Get thee to a locked facility that will keep children safe from you Humbert!"
"2081",2080,"Meagan","I found this book far too disturbing to enjoy it. Maybe that's the point. I just felt gross reading it."
"2088",2087,"Angelica","It took me forever to finish this book! Honestly I think that says enough. I had such a hard time staying hooked. I don't like starting and not finishing books, which is really the only reason I persevered.Humbert is so incredibly arrogant and annoying. At times I wish I could've told him to shut up with his rambling and just get straight to the story. I'm disappointed. I think I imagined the book to be more interesting than what it is, just the insane ramblings of a pedophile."
"2092",2091,"Joy (Thoughts of Joy)","Read my thoughts at: Thoughts of Joy..."
"2093",2092,"ian nix","I don't know why, in the present literary climate, stories need to be disgustingly raw to be called art or beautiful. This was not beautiful and I don't know what Nabokov accomplished artistically other than a few brilliant phrase-turns. He's a great writer, but I don't want to read about a guy in his mid-thirties getting his rocks off with a nine year-old."
"2095",2094,"Sasha","Read it because I felt like I should after reading ""Reading Lolita in Tehran."" Wasn't impressed by it bur feel like it should be read because its known as a classic."
"2096",2095,"Lorian Bruce","Has the male of the species progressed since this work was created? Judging by the Victoria Secret Commercials, I think not."
"2101",2100,"Charmaign Mauren","I tried to read this book out of curiosity when I read the plot. The author plays with his words and most of the time I could read French words which makes me stop and look up at my online translator to know what it means. Well the emotion of the author is so intense that he wrote it beautifully which makes me feel it. I don't think there is something wrong about the book. Every author can express anything. So when you don't feel like reading it, it is okay. And I could say I recommend young girls to reading it. It is not forbidden. I have read romance novels when I was young. It should do just fine. "
"2121",2120,"Kristine","One word: Meh.Wanna read literature that's actually revolutionary? Read a memoir or a story of a girl who was a victim of abuse from her own point of view. Trust me, no 3 pages of painstaking details/wordplay of furniture in there.Nabokov's writing is inventive and oftentimes quite poetic and beautiful. But subject matter makes me want to burn it. Not sure what sort of revolutionary idea you're supposed to take from this, old men have been lusting after young women since the dawn of patriarchy and still are. All it really does is try and get you to sympathize with the guy by painting him as a human who doesn't want to act on his desires, which isn't a new idea either. Why is this considered a classic? I don't get it. Honestly reading it was a waste of my time.“Words without experience are meaningless.” Wish Nabokov could've taken his own advice."
"2122",2121,"Jennn","The prose was lovely, but the story was a bit weak. However, due to the content matter, I had to put it down. I usually don't get squeamish, but I suppose that this is the line I draw. Great vocabulary usage, though..."
"2127",2126,"Alla","the author was a sick man. at first it started as a decent story but ends with a bunch of sick pedophile thoughts. i couldn't even finish it. i thought i throw up."
"2129",2128,"Amy Jones","I will concede that this is an extremely well written book, but if you are wondering whether or not to embark on this literary classic, let me give you this friendly warning: Lolita is not just a book about pedophilia, the reader becomes the pedophile. Our narrator, Humbert Humbert goes into excessive and explicit detail while chronicling his lust for Lolita. The reader is not just a passive observer, the reader is an accomplice. While I have read several books with controversial content, this is the first and only book I have ever thrown away. If you choose to descend into the depths of depravity with Humbert, be prepared to feel perverse and dirty. His mind is not a place I feel comfortable, so I never finished the journey. "
"2138",2137,"❁Lisa Ann❃","Since I listened to the Audible version, I wish there was a separate rating available for the narrator, as Jeremy Irons would receive a 5++ from me!!Regarding the story itself, it does contain much elegant prose, however I could not get beyond the subject matter. It may be touted by some as a love story, but in my opinion neither character is capable of feeling unselfishly motivated feelings for another person. By the time I reached the mid-way point in the plot, I just wanted to get to the end of the story asap!!"
"2139",2138,"Michaela","Maybe I'm still not old enough but I just did not get it and felt disgusted most of the time."
"2154",2153,"Rachel Kopel","Looking back on this book, I would not read it today. I am much more sensitive to sexual abuse and exploitation."
