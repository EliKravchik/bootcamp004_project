"5",4,"Nada Shams","Not my cup of tea. Yet another writer writing 560 pages on what could have been covered in 300; paying off debts..."
"7",6,"Mira","Okay... I only finished the first two chapters of this book, but I have no desire at this time to go further... and I love Dostoyevsky! So, go figure. But honestly, I can't see what made him write this (extremely long) novel! I don't find murderers interesting, nor do I believe in redemption of them. Maybe I'll try again later... there could be something beyond the first two chapters that makes this novel worth reading! "
"8",7,"Oma Eagle","I have 1960 edition - this cover"
"10",9,"Marsha","Couldn't get through it....too dark!"
"11",10,"Dave Gold","In my effort to read the best classic fiction, I read this book around 2001 or so. I have to say, of the books on that list, I felt this was the worst. The plot is simple, and in this day and age, is very dated. The characters argue with each other endlessly and monotonously, which is 95% of the book, plot being the remaining 5%. I cannot understand why this is considered to be such a classic; I do not recommend it unless you feel like being tortured and bored. It was a chore to read it."
"12",11,"Nadia","Hard work!"
"15",14,"Annie Grigg","They say an author reveals himself in his work. It could not be more true than with this book. You get a very clear depiction of not only the author's opinion and experiences but his state of mind and state of mind in the past. That being said, while it was a very intellectual read which I usually enjoy, this seemed long winded and drawn out. What could have been said in three sentences took up a page and a half which I found aggravating. I often had to reread parts to make sure I caught everything. "
"16",15,"emily","Can someone who loved this book explain it to me? I felt like it was so long, so verbose, and so pedantic. It felt like a school assignment to me, getting through it. Yes, it was a musing on guilt, and I got the basic moral dilemma. But it wasn't enjoyable, and I felt like it could have been, I don't know, 350 pages shorter. Still ... I finished. CHECK! UPDATE: Just heard on NPR today (timely), that Dostoevsky was likely suffering from something called hypergraphia, which is mental disorder resulting in the overwhelming urge to write. That explains a lot. (FYI, other authors associated with hypergraphia include: Byron, Dante, Moliere, Petrarch, Poe, and Tennyson)."
"24",23,"Meg Kumm","The story of Crime and Punishment is good. The plot keeps the reader engaged and the motifs present throughout the novel are interesting. However, there is a lot of extra material that enables the book to drag on and on. While the story is good, the reading of Crime and Punishment is slow and at times, boring."
"26",25,"Epicbookaddict","Wow…The story is dark to be sure as are most that delve into moral dilemmas, mental anguish and the like. There were times (very, very far into the book) that I 'felt' for Rodion and wished I could crawl into the pages and help him along his way. I am glad that I read the book as I found the story intriguing and thought provoking; however you must commit yourself to finish this book if you start it. For me I was more than half way through before it began to justify itself. Perhaps something is lost in translation…I don't know but there are SO MANY words and I'm a fan of words. "
"28",27,"Kailee Croft","This book left me feeling terrible inside. The twisted mind and terrible way about the antagonist was something to be felt. I found myself hoping, waiting, wanting him to get better, to feel happy. This book left me feeling rather depressed. And the names of the characters, don't even get me started. I couldn't tell you how to read them even if someone said them for me. The book did carry a lot of symbolism in it though, and that was appreciated. After i read it, i felt very empty inside, but also kind of satisfied as well, because justice always wins. I wouldn't really say this was a favorite book of mine, and it wasn't something i would tell a bunch of my friends to go read, but it had its good moments and if you like crime, depressing, hard names to read, and killing, then this book it all for you."
"29",28,"Kathi Smith","I'm sure this is a good book. I just can't get through it - I keep getting lost to the point where I finally had to give up."
"31",30,"Jennie De","Too depressing to finish..."
"33",32,"Ame Mahoney","This book took me about 12 attempts over 7 years to finally get through. And it still wasn't worth it. To this day, I don't remember much about it except that it was arduous and painful reading. "
"40",39,"Thomas","Crime and Punishment is an intriguing three-hundred page story muddled by the additional three-hundred pages comprising its length. What might otherwise prove a timeless meditation on the nature of guilt and its effect upon the human psyche, is constantly interrupted by its own characters’ diatribes and treatises (to say nothing of Dostoyevsky’s penchant for melodrama). These aforesaid passages nearly always prove awkward and out of place, like the date of an invited guest forcing small talk at a party full of strangers. Apparently Dostoyevsky felt his readers needed instruction on his every academic whim. The result is a novel far from deserving of the title masterpiece. That so many people say otherwise makes for an apt study of cognitive dissonance: perhaps people inflate C-and-P’s worth in order to rationalize the time it takes to finish reading it...Long story short, Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment is a disjointed novel peopled by loquaciously insufferable characters, which – most frustrating of all – is still good enough to compel one to finish it! "
"44",43,"Eric Lin","Turn yourself in, or accept that you're the bad guy. The 400 pages of angst is unbecoming. Come on, man."
"45",44,"John Byrd","This book wasn't for me and I don't totally get the hype. It was too predictable and based on the morals/principles of aristocracy; Common man would not have acted in this way. Whereas Tolstoy's War and Peace presented his narrative from multiple viewpoints from all levels of society as well as dissenting views from same levels of society. Crime and Punishment just didn't get me to THINK in new ways.Also, the title character is presented as a sociopath initially, redemption from which would never occur in the form of confession. "
"47",46,"Chrissy","Tough read!"
"48",47,"Lisa Wellington","I read it because I thought I should. I travel to Russia for business sometimes and am on the look-out for interesting reads set in or about the country. This one was rather long and drawn out. I wanted to just watch the movie while doing some light housework or something like that."
"49",48,"Gauri Poswal","The topics discussed in the book are critical for the health and happiness of any society, as observed since ancient times and similar will be possible conclusions in foreseeable future. The book is definitely relevant. And there were many aspects of the protagonist's complex character that today's average citizen may relate with. The story itself had the few surprises that made it interesting. However, all this, together, could not sustain my undivided attention for any length of time. The book was not a page turner. But then again, I read the English version. Maybe a lot was lost in translation. "
"51",50,"Olivia Langford","First of all, I had to change the book on my shelf because I had accidentally picked a version here that was marked as abridged and I did not read the abridged version.This being my first exposure to Russian Literature, I wasn't prepared for what I began when I picked up this book several years ago at a used book store. This is not an easy read and I reccommend using Cliff's notes or another form of literary help when delving into this one. I didn't do that, and I think the novel would have been much more enjoyable for me if I had. The psychology and philiosophy in the story interested me most of all, as well as the main character Raskolnikov. While I felt sympathy toward him, I also felt pity, and was confounded at his choices. The writing is powerful and thought-provoking, albeit achingly slow.I gave this book two stars simply because I felt as though I were trudging through it. I consider it a feat that I even finished it, given my usual lack of patience for ""slow"" reading. I reccommend this book if you like classical literature and are not too impatient. A good memory helps too, as each character has about three different names that the narrator uses at any given time, and it can be very distracting if you can't remember who is who.If you do decide to go for it, good luck and keep with it. The ending (or perhaps just being able to say you finished it) will make it worth your effort."
"52",51,"Bardha Ajeti","Although a classic, this book was just really long and repetitive! Rasknikov plans the perfect murder- killing the pawnbroker who is hated by almost everyone. After committing the crime, Raskolnikov feels guilty for his action and tries to forget that unforgettable night. "
"53",52,"Doug Wright","Wordy wordy wordy...I know he's a classic, but I couldn't hang with 100 page descriptions about one scene...and the internal workings of a mad man's mind. But I would give this one a try again someday."
"56",55,"Roby","الكتاب ده مش عارفه اقيمه لانى مش عارفه اكمله ابدا كل ما ببدأ فيه يصبنى نوع من الاكتئاب ما اقدرش اكمله "
"57",56,"Ryan Mishap","Pretty silly from a modern viewpoint, but and intense murder scene."
"62",61,"Dr. E","Although vastly important as a classic, this one was both a crime and punishment for me as a teenager."
"65",64,"Silvana","Don't be angry with me, all ye Dostoyevsky fans!I could've given this book 3 stars but unfortunately it has the following traits that I could not ignore:- It got me yawning several times (a 3-star book could bore me at times but never induce a yawn) - The story should be much much more concise so it would be more efficient. I suppose 250 pages (around half) would have been great. Should have been a novella, even, as initially planned by Dostoyevsky himself (tut-tut...)- the self rambling of Raskolnikov is enough for anyone to tear his/her hair out. He's absolutely my least favorite character in the book. A wretched loser who didn't deserve any sympathy from me.- the overlengthy soliloquy/monologue/dialogue is too much for my taste. ""Get to the effin point, will ya!"" or ""So....what's your point?"" or ""Geez, this dude lost me at his third sentence..."" are my most used expressions when reading this book.Oh c'mon Silvana, are you sure this book, this so-called masterpiece classic, world-renowned, critically acclaimed, monumental writing, yadda yadda yadda, has no positive traits at all?Well, of course there are some. Well, I think the first hundred of pages are quite enthralling. Dostoyevsky was good with weaving words and stuffs (despite the lack of editing skill) and I've read worse narration from other classical writers. Most of the characters were predictable stereotypes, but as an ensemble they're okay. How about the philosophy? Was it THAT boring? Well, not exactly. Some ideas of nihilism and stuff were quite enjoyable to read. I also think this book is still a must-read if you're curious enough about Dostoyevsky and/or Russian literature. Ok so Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Solzhenitsyn, checked. Turgenev & Chekov next?"
"66",65,"Mindy Burch","Well, I gave this one the old college try. I couldn't get through it. There's something freeing about not finishing a book. I no longer finish just because I should. Ahhh."
"67",66,"Human Johnson","I really wanted to enjoy this book. I have started this book on three different occasions; this time making it to page 179. I just couldn't get into it even though I am intrigued by the concept."
"69",68,"Eugene Slaven","I liken the experience of reading Crime and Punishment to that of an exhausted man clothed in rags crawling through miles of desert in search of water. This is the only book I recall reading in my adult life that I desperately wanted to end. If you suddenly crave a 19th century Russian classic, and you're one of those people who has to finish a book even if it doesn't hold your interest, do not read Crime and Punishment.This exceedingly brooding tome is not terrible, per se, it's just not that good. The value you derive from reading this book is directly correlated to wasting your time.The main problem with the novel is that whatever insight into human nature C&P elucidates is buried under endless words: long-winded, often pointless monologues; trivial details about people and places; and redundant dialogues. There is no comic relief, no break from an intensely morose narrative. If you hate your life, I guess it couldn't hurt to read this tedious criminal drama/ soul crusher. But if you're not suicidal or not majoring in Classic Russian Literature with a concentration in Kill Me, there’s really no reason to pick up this book. The only reason I was compelled to read it is that ever since I dabbled in existentialist literature in high school—Camus, Sartre, etc.—I had heard that C&P is one of the original existentialist novels. And so I always wanted to give it a shot, even though I have grown to dislike Camus and Sartre, because I consider existentialism a rather trite rehash of other philosophies. The existentialist themes—e.g. alienation, absurdity—are woven through the novel, but their potency and resonance are greatly dulled by the clumsily constructed plot and, to be redundant, endless words. After nearly three months of struggling through this massive and gratuitously verbose tome, I have finally crawled out of this brutal literary desert. "
"71",70,"Alina","I may be the only Russian who didn't love this book. I got angry and frustrated with it, and was swearing under my breath while reading it. So it got me engaged emotionally, if not intellectually."
"75",74,"Cuatro","tedious.... very tedious...."
"77",76,"Rema Mohamd","you realy don't know after reading the novel the diffrence between the crime and who realy deserve the punishmint ;)"
"78",77,"Federico","Scritto magistralmente, e molto appassionante, per�� continua a non piacermi particolarmente, Dostooevskij."
"82",81,"Eidam289","S touto knihou som to vzdala. Bolo to obrovské sklamanie. Ešte prvých 100 strán sa táto kniha pohybovala vo sfére čiatateľnosti, ale potom to išlo veľmi prudko dole. Väčšinou mi nevadí, keď v knihe nie je veľa akcie, keď je o zaujímavých myšlienkach a úvahách, ale akcia tam úplne chýbala a to, čo predvádzal Raskoľnikov podľa mňa rozmýšľanie nebolo. Bol to sled náhodných slov, ktoré občas dávali zmysel, ale častejšie nie. Jediné rozumné veci, ktoré v tej knihe niekto povedal, rozhodne nepochádzali od neho. A upozorňujem, že Raskoľnikov mal takmer 150 stranový monológ!!! Samozrejme, boli tam našťastie párstranové prerušenia, keď sa zvyšné postavy bavili o tom, čo sa deje alebo riešili vlastný osud (a tieto časti boli naozaj dobré), ale všetko sa točilo okolo Raskoľnikova, ktorý sa stal jednou z mojich najneobľúbenejších knižných postáv a definitívne tou najotravnejšou knižnou postavou vôbec. Čo sa klasiky týka, vedela by som jeho chovanie prirovnať možno k Daisy z Veľkého Gatsbyho, ale aj tá sa chovala rozumnejšie ako on a aspoň sa 400 strán vo Veľkom Gatsbym neriešili jej ""myšlienkové"" pochody. Nedokážem si predtaviť, ako je možné, že táto kniha sa môže niekomu páčiť. Mám klasiku rada a na túto knihu som sa tešila, ale bol to podľa mňa des. Tešila som sa na ďalšie Dostojevského knihy, ale teraz veľmi vážne pochybujem o tom, že si ich prečítam. "
"83",82,"Amy Herrington","Maybe one I need to read again to get the full impact. As it was, I found it a bit hit and miss. "
"84",83,"Kini Chang","Seriously disliked this book but I think it was cause I was forced to read it my senior year in school. I think it might deserve another go. "
"87",86,"AnnaMarie","Finally done! This is a supremely long and boring book. But, I had to see what happened at the end. Some parts were interesting, but he could have easily cut out a few hundred pages. :) Never read that again."
"88",87,"Karen Hanson","Not really sure what the big deal is about this book. Very forgettable. Maybe I just don't like Dostoyevsky."
"91",90,"Clay","Okay, I give up. I've tried several different authors' books, but I'm faced with the inescapable conclusion that 19th century Russian novels just aren't for me. That's right -- I'm talking to you, Fyodor."
"99",98,"Synnin","My 2 stars are given only because i read that one too early. Being 14 and reading stuff like is EARLY. Unfortunately it was included into 9th grade school programme and i had no other choice than read it. I didnt really understand anything, it seemed boring and tedious for me, like to any 14 y/o kiddo.I will definately re-read ""Crime and Punishment"" NOW. It's a brilliant piece of literature absolutely worth reading.Of course if you got used to easy romance or detective reading - give up to like Dostoevsky."
"101",100,"Lisa J","can take this in only chunks.Yep, I gave up."
"102",101,"Clara","I probably could have loved this if it were about 300 pages shorter, but as it was, I had to drag myself through most of it. What's really disappointing is that just getting rid of the repetition could have gotten rid of most of the annoying length."
"104",103,"Elisabeth","The real punishment was reading it. "
"109",108,"Jared","I know it's a classic, but I've tried reading it twice and still haven't been able to finish it."
"110",109,"Lindsay Leshin","I tried, I really did. I am not sure if it was trying to keep track of all the similar looking Russian names or, again, if something was lost in translation, but I just couldn't get myself into this book. There were some bits of good reading when the narration was describing the thought process of Raskolnikov (how he was regretting his decision to murder the pawnbroker and her sister, his internal struggle at trying to make sense of the situation), but other than that, I wasn't thoroughly impressed. Looking back, a lot of it actually reminded me of Les Miserables, not only did you have the story of the despicable main character, but you had the side story of many other miserable people as well (Marmeladov and his wife, Dunya, etc. {and yes, I had to look in the book to spell all of these characters' names correctly}). I am not totally deterred from Dostoyevsky, but for now, I am deterred from this book. Maybe I will try again in a few years. "
"112",111,"Blake","Dostoevsky has not impressed his talents upon me. This story contained a wonderful intensity and at it's end a kind of catastrophe's calm aftermath. The feelings it bears in one are strong and well-defined, yet divorced from the characters and narrative. Perhaps The Brothers Karamazov can redeem him for me."
"115",114,"Ariel","Eh. I didn't enjoy reading this book. The twists of the plot make me want compare the author to Charles Dickens (who I don't much care for either). I prefer my twisty-turny soap opera plots in my television, and sexy-ified, thanks. To me, Raskolnikov as a character is what the book was all about, which is probably quite shallow (?). I didn't find R. particularly compelling in the way that others seem to. His madness/mania/whatever you want to call it didn't resonate with me (at least not at the time at which I read it), which is to say that I do not see my face reflected in his (as he sees his own face reflected in his victim's eyes...). The fact remains that R. is certainly a useful character to know, if only for the myriad pop culture references made to him. "
"116",115,"Robert","Pure agony. Maybe I'll give it another try someday."
"122",121,"S.","I kind of hated this, to be honest. Talk about pages upon pages of repetitive inner turmoil. If it wasn’t Rodya, it was the insufferable Katerina Ivanovna (whose turmoil was more external and just as tedious). I thought it might be better to read a book about C&P, say a Freudian interpretation, rather than the novel itself. Apologies to the Russian lovers, whom I count myself among.Hey, good structure, though! I liked the episodic narrative. "
"125",124,"Jane","I wanted to like it because it's a classic but found it too slow."
"127",126,"Brian Edwards","Having to read this book is cruel and unusual punishment for any crime. Tedious. Monotonous. Longwinded...Russian. Read MacBeth instead."

I was so overwhelmed by them.It was also so psychotic and depressive it left in low spirits! and it's only January!I never wrote such a long review but this is a strange book and despite the hateful things I could say about it, I still believe it is a good one if you skip the dialogues/monologues."
"168",167,"Fraser Hoban","Maybe one I'll finish it, but the main character is still lying in bed and life might just be too short for this one"
"169",168,"Ina","Actually i feel guilty about my rating. I tried to find some good things in this book, something that would change my mind about it or make me look differently at some aspects concerning Raskolnikov and crime he commited. But nope. No. Nada. Zilch. I'm blaming myself that i don't understand such a great peace of classic, but for me ""Crime and punishment"" was like a theatrical performance. Everyone was way too much expressive, emotions were exaggerated and everyone was.... just hysteric.And after i finished it, i started to read reviews and some said that maybe in original ""Crime and punishment"" is better than in translations. Well, i need to dissapoint you. It wasn't better. Not in english. Not in latvian. And not even in russian.Maybe after some five or ten years i will re-read this book and my thoughts on it will change, but right now i can't stand that everthing in this book was overdone. Even if it's a classic.There! I said it!(you see even my review after reading this book is hysteric -_-)"
"170",169,"Yebbey","Story about law student who murders an acid old pawnbroker for money that he would use good and take he out of misery. Killing succeeds but he feels guilty and ends up in Siberia.The only good idea in the book was the same of Nietzsche, that there is no God or values that man cannot step over, if needed. Otherwise the book is slow paced and over described - pretty much boring."

Overall, to me, it was a disappointment. "
"179",178,"Jerry","should prolly re-read it."
"181",180,"James Knowles","It's a decent story that deserves to be rated higher. However, personally I find Russian literature quite tedious, generally. Crime and Punishment was no exception. The story itself leaves a lot of questions unanswered especially with some characters' motivations for their actions. After Raskalikov's crime (I don't want to inject spoilers) I went back and re-read a couple of times, but was left very unsatisfied with regard to his own motivations. It's as though Dostoevsky wanted to just get to the aftereffects of the crime. That's what the book is about, so I'm willing to overlook a somewhat clumsy handling of the dirty deed. I took this story in small bites, reading over the web on my iPhone during moments of ""down time"". The book may be found at www.bartleby.com/318/"
"182",181,"Humphries","For me this was a tough book to read but, I'm glad I did. This book explores the human mind, paranoia, and what ""normal"" people can do when they are desperate."
"184",183,"Anothermattking","At times it felt like I was the one who had committed the crime and this was my punishment. Labour intensive read."
"185",184,"Grayson Queen","Have you ever been hyped for a movie and then when you see it find that the movie is just average. But you know if there hadn't been that hype you might have had a better opinion. Exact same thing here.Crime and Punishment has been heralded as a classic, praised and assigned as necessarily reading. I question however, the title of ""classic"" that has been given to this book, because to be a classic I think it should be also good. The fact is the only reason it's been given the title is because it's old. There is little a person can get from this book other than an insight into pre-Stalin Russia and the mindset of it's people.Most of the book consists of characters over verbalizing and ranting about this and that, making it feel more like platform for half realized philosophy. The same kind of philosophy that's developed by youthful ignorance. the other half of the book is filled with descriptions of people fainting, trembling and having fits. While I'm no expert on historical psychology I feel like all these frenzies were a dramatization that made the novel untrue to reality. Somewhere deep in paragraphs of diatribe from the main character I thought I was reading a poorly written play, watching Raskolnikov pace the stage talking moaning out loud about his thoughts so as to keep the story moving.And I know that it's uneducated of me to complain about, but I found the fact that every character had multiple names distracting. Despite knowing that it's a culture matter of translation.In the end that I had been duped. Crime and Punishment was less about punishment and poor about the criminal activities of the poor and unfortunate. Dostoyevsky may have attempted to compare the morality of humans and their crimes, but only succeeded in revealing his own person beliefs that in this day and age look petty, self centered and lacking integrity."
"186",185,"Dedarth","I decided to read this book for 3 reasons- a. I needed to read a classic for one of my book challenges, b. I am always partial to murder plots and c. I am also partial to Russian names. The only think the book delivered on was the Russian names and I am done with a classic. The plot on the other hand was let down. So Raskolnikov is a supposed brilliant mind, the synopsis says so, the author implies so - but I remain unconvinced. Raskolnikov, to me, feels like a delusional, pompous, week willed character with more luck than brains. But, most unforgivable of all is that he is so uninteresting, even in his angst. Maybe he is uninteresting because of his angst? I am not sure.What I am sure is that I would have loved the cast and plot if it could only have been rewritten by Somerset Maugham. "

"200",199,"Nicole Fowler","Found it too over-dramatic, dragged out, soap-opera-in-a-book.

Despite his logical assumptions on his spiritual right to murder people, he loses his grip on reality shortly after. Raskolnikov is later redeemed through religion and the love of a broken woman. Are you fucking kidding me??I do not understand the fuss over this classic. I do, however, appreciate the near legendary achievement of reading the entire piece. Based on years of pop culture references, I was expecting something far more dark and dramatic. I was highly impressed at the initial introduction of Raskolnikov's studies on the nature of superman and expected to read some amazing and terrifying acts of depravity.

It about a Russian student who is so obsessed with the idea of superior and inferior people that he decides that he, as a superior, has a right to murder other people. He does exactly that. Then the book gets so convoluted with dialogue that I lost interest. Oh, well. I gave it a shot. I didn't like the book and I make no apologies for it."

"242",241,"Steve Waters","I totally get why this book is so appreciated in the literary world. It's a well-crafted story about a specific time in Russian society that was critiqued by an author who had experienced its roughest aspects. The protagonist (?) represents the epitome of someone who has taken the full abuse of his surroundings and has become a demented, tortured human being because of it. It carries a powerful message, and delivers it well.The reason I gave it only two stars is simply because I didn't enjoy it, and I don't recommend it for someone who is looking for a downright good read. If you're looking to empathize with a downtrodden populace at a rough point in their history and really learn something about the human condition in a book, have at 'er. But if you're like me and you want a book that interests you while maybe teaching you something at the same time, look somewhere else. I realize that makes me sound like a shallow reader, but from a storyline perspective, this one is just tough. The main character is a psychopath (tough to relate to) and the story is intentionally written tediously in order to mirror the tedium of lower class Russian life at the time. Sound enjoyable?"

I was always excited to read more, but after the fact I can't remember why I thought it was so good. I would recommend it to specific people, but it's not a book I'd recommend to everybody."

I’m really surprised how fast I got through this book but at the same time I skimmed a lot of pages trying to reach the main point...I 'm going to write my review in points:1) I enjoyed getting deep to Raskolnikov's internal struggle and emotions .. he is really a conflicted character..On the one hand, he is cold, apathetic, and antisocial; on the other, he can be surprisingly warm ,compassionate, care for others and Give charity without thinking.. and then committed murder (I really feel sad for him )and he allowed his soul to be swallowed by darkness...2)although I like this Raskolnikov's intelligence and compassion, I hate his sick ideas , his dark thoughts , when he come to disbelieve in the lord , it doesn't matter for me .. it is his choice and he is the one responsible for it ,, but I really hate it when he bad-mouthed the prophet Mohammed and compared him with other criminals .. Prophet Muhammad was the embodiment of mercy, he showed compassion to all those around him, family, orphans, friends, strangers and even enemies. He also treated the environment and animals with respect and mercy.. The Prophet, may God praise him, said, “Whoever kills a sparrow or anything bigger than that without a just cause, God will hold him accountable on the Day of Judgment.” The listeners asked, “O Messenger of God, what is a just cause?” He replied, “That he will kill it to eat, not simply to chop off its head and then throw it away.3) I cant stop my tears from streaming down my face on the death of Marmeladov and my chest feels really tight on Raskolnikov's mother death from agony on her son ... 4) My favorite character : Polina -> Ten year old adopted daughter to Marmeladov ( such innocent ,pure hearted , assistant to her mother and caring for her family )5) finally i really like the story lines , the course of events and scenes are stunning in deep photographed the human psyche and motivations through psychoanalysis of each position and the way the author depicts the punishment that Raskolnikov received for his crime and each character in the story with amazing talent."
"271",270,"Chris Ko","""Crime and Punishment"" is a murder novel about Raskolnikov, a poor man who envisions a great dream to provide wealth for his impoverished neighborhood. He kills a pawnbroker to use her money for good, but ends up getting caught in several problems. As this novel continues, we see Raskolnikov developing a sense of guilt for the death of the pawnbroker. With all this going on he meets several characters that also builds up the tension of the novel. Despite the fact that this is a great murder novel, I found this book to be very lengthy. It was at a point in which I felt like every event was dragging the novel slowly. In addition, I expected this novel to be the typical murder-mystery book that I enjoy reading, however it turned out to be a book about the aftermath of a murder. Despite all this I did find it interesting how this book relates with our morals. Every character in this novel questions particular morals whether it can be considered good or bad. Overall, I did not enjoy this novel despite it being a classic."
"272",271,"Steph","I read this at gunpoint to satisfy one of my students who chose it for his summer reading title. I am not a philosopher and I quickly tire of drawn out discussions of, in this case, guilt, God, and retribution. When is a crime justified? An interesting question, but not for the entire length of the book. Nor do I care about the biographical links and the personal struggles of Dostoyevsky that frame the book. I also resent the role of women in the book: angel or whore and no in between. "

"285",284,"james","my least favorite dostoevsky novel is also his most popular here in the u.s.it is horribly predictable, and it beats the horse to death, or at least raskolnikov's dilemma. 20 pages was all it would have taken to get his point across - 100 with embellishments."
"289",288,"Carena","This book was on my to-read list for a long, long time. I expected a psychological thriller straight from the mind of the criminal, but I was seriously disappointed.

"292",291,"M"," Early Emo. "
"295",294,"Andrew John Pixton","This was interesting but like most classics, became long and dry. The conversations are articulate, like an ode to words, but then they get carried away resulting in monologuing. But I liked it as an exploration of the psychology of criminals.But here's my thoughts on the concept behind the story (spoilers). The main character has this theory that he wants to test, like a good philosopher. His theory means that there are certain people who are so above average, who are so exceptional, that to them everything is permitted. They have no moral restrictions. An interesting, if appalling idea. What I like about it, is that this is really just the philosophy of criminals. When someone commits a crime, he makes himself an exception to the rule. The same applies to large scale immorality like genocide or tyranny.I like the psychological paranoia he goes through after, also characteristic of criminality or tyranny. Aside from the view being self-defeating and unethical, it fails because someone is exceptional because they are moral rather than the other way around. His criteria for an exceptional person is to accomplish some greater deed or to fulfill some achievement. He says Napolean was such an individual. Well, Napolean failed and even had he succeeded, being brilliant does not justify a conquest. But Ruskolnikov's criteria for himself is his own idea, of being exceptional. He's exceptional because of his theory about exceptionalism. Circular logic.So it was an interesting and dry book. He was a pretty badass character (I always like those) until the end, when he turns himself in. Favorite quote of the book: “We're always thinking of eternity as an idea that cannot be understood, something immense. But why must it be? What if, instead of all this, you suddenly find just a little room there, something like a village bath-house, grimy, and spiders in every corner, and that's all eternity is. Sometimes, you know, I can't help feeling that that's what it is.” "
"296",295,"Brian Godsey","It's more tedious than Anna Karenina even though it's half as long, and the analysis of criminal psychology the back cover of the book bragged about was disappointing. However, I liked the supporting characters---no matter how one-dimensional they were---and the way they interacted with each other and with Raskolnikov. Overall, it's a good book."
"298",297,"Starr","My father-in-law suggested I read this book. To humor him I did. It was torture while reading, but looking back I don't know that I've ever read a more though provoking novel."

"300",299,"Richard Beaty","All the reviews of this book made it sound like a true classic that was great in character study. I was really disappointed. It became very boring to me and seemed like it would never end. I'm glad to have read it just to know what it is about. But, it is not a book I would read again."
"306",305,"Nurul Nadzirin","I thought it quite tedious. The length was comparatively decent, but I felt like it was twice of that. There were too many sub-characters and sub-stories than I'd like to read about. One thing I rather enjoyed was reading a good part of the prose, especially during the two instances of altercations between Looshin and the main characters. However 100 pages before the end I had tired of the whole story, and just wished for the last page to come quicker. It is certainly not a bad book, though, although I am too tired after finishing the book to expand on that. Yawn."
"307",306,"Rhea","Crime and Punishment, for me, took some warming up to as probably every long, foreign novel might. Much of the novel dealt with the condition of Russia at the time, so being able to understand what was going on required some background knowledge, some historical research. At certain points, I found myself just counting away the pages and not really taking in any of the substance on them, probably just from lack of understanding or familiar ground. As Raskolnikov became psychologically more ill, as did I. However, certain characters served to really save the reading for me - Porfiry Petrovich and Svidrigailov, for example. Each character was a well-depicted model of some type of psychological shortcoming. Analyzing their emotions and actions was really the redemption of the novel for me. "
"310",309,"Shane Smith","I did not like this book very much at all. It was too long and had terrible character development for the length. There were too many subplots and tangents that I didn't feel really help the story.I never felt engaged or involved and I had trouble getting into the story each time I started again. I'm not even really sure why it's a classic ""must read"" type of book. I don't really feel enlightened or better prepared for life or even more well-rounded afterwards. "

Dito isto corro o risco de afirmar que não percebi bem o porque de crime e castigo ser um clássico incontornável da literatura. Entendo a importância histórica para a literatura russa. Mas o dilema filosófico, psicológico e moral, que é a premissa da narrativa, é fraquinho. Raskolnikov é uma personagem detestável e ao mesmo tempo absolutamente desinteressante. Cruel, fraco, caprichoso, histérico, mimado. Não me foi possível interessar-me pela luta interior do protagonista quando este me aborrecia de morte. O meu problema talvez seja um abismo cultural e temporal, tudo na história me parece demasiado exagerado, desproporcional, hiperbolizado e fundamentalmente irreal. Mesmo dando o desconto para a natureza emocional dos russos e acreditando que no século XIX estivessem constantemente a beira do histerismo não consigo ler aqui um estudo profundo da psicologia humana quando as personagens não me parecem reais. A redenção final extremamente moralista e piegas foi a gota de água. (E depois de tudo isto, tive de baixar a minha cotação inicial para 2 estrelas)"

"363",362,"Martin","The book has six parts and an epilogue. The first part, leading up to the murder, grabbed me by the balls. Parts 2 to 4 bored me to death, as each character is introduced and proceeds to talk for pages at a time, never taking a breath. Each character represents different currents in 1860s Russia (Hedonist, Nihilist, Rationalist, Christianist, Modernist) and hence speaks in the voice of the theory they symbolize. BORING! Part 5 started to pull me back in, during a funeral (you know I love a bad funeral) in which the widow continuously insults her landlady to the point of being evicted, at which point she goes totally mad in a Borderline Personality way and starts doing all sorts of crazy stuff in the community. Part 6 was great, as the Hedonist character says all sorts of lewd and wildly inappropriate stuff that I found pleasurable to read. The epilogue almost converted me into a fan, but then turned treacly. Overall, the protagonist is supposed to be redeemed by his new found faith given to him by the love of a former hooker with a heart of gold. No thanks. "

"369",368,"Ogo Igweonu","Not really interesting"
"370",369,"Adam Hewitt","This novel is full of scenes of people saying nothing for such long periods of time that it’s often, frankly, unbelievable . The characters pause their conversations just to think/stare/consider for ‘one minute’, ‘two minutes’, and at one point even ‘ten minutes’ – socially awkward doesn’t begin to cover it.I found it weirdly distracting, because they were usually all so bloody talkative, monologuing for page after page.The second half of this book is far superior to the first, which apart from the titular ‘crime’ really does not have much going on – far too much Jane Austen-style social positioning and ponderous clearly-doomed courtship chat, without the wit, coupled with an awful lot of faintly inexplicable woe-is-me.I appreciate that Dostoyevsky has written a carefully-structured and philosophical, artful take on redemption, sacrifice, misery and justice – but as a story, it’s rarely compelling.In saying that, there is a fantastic dream/memory sequence about a mob killing a horse, some vivid hallucinatory wanderings post-‘crime’, and some semi-interesting scenes of provincial life in St Petersburg 150 years ago.The second half of the book has much more going for it, once our (anti-)hero Razkolnikov has regained the majority of his senses. His friend Razumihin, who would have been the protagonist had this been another kind of novel, mostly sticks by him, although why is not always obvious…but the plot becomes clearer, there is some genuine humour and emotion, and the occasional sense of threat or suspense. The central philosophical idea of this book is interesting and explored in extreme detail. But I can’t recommend it as a novel."

Having heard how heavy a read it was from others, I resolved I would get through it and I did in three weeks. I admit, I trudged through it. At times, I felt I was being tortured to the same degree as Dostoyevsky's main character, Raskolnikov, was torturing himself. I would only recommend reading this book to someone who can handle page upon page of mental anguish like only the great Russian authors can dish out. "

"401",400,"Josh Paul","I found Crime and Punishment generally boring, and at times barely coherent.This isn't a problem with Dostoevsky or the translation (I read The Idiot, Demons, The Brother's Karamazov, and Notes From the Underground - all by the same translators). It may just be that I am no longer at a proper point in my life to appreciate Dostoevsky.Like all of his books Crime & Punishment is a polemic, and like most of what he wrote post 1864 it's a fundamentally conservative polemic. That said, Dostoevsky is a generally affable conservative - his characters are typically sad, rather than angry, about the ostensible horrors of liberalism.What Crime and Punishment lacked - to my mind - was a strong central character. Raskolnikov is neither likable, like Alyosha K. or Prince Myshkin, or articulate enough in his evil to be interesting, like the the Underground Man, Stavrogin, or Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky.Dostoevsky is a writer for people who want to be challenged in certain ways. At his best he can force you to acknowledge your own moral failings and consider your own complicity in immorality of the sort he writes about. The trouble is that because Raskolnikov is such an unlikable character he is difficult to relate to, or really care about much one way or another.I should note that if I'd read Dostoevsky's books in reverse order I might be saying all this about the Idiot instead. Given how similar much of his work is it may just be that the points he's making are tiresome to the point that they go in one eye and out the other nowadays."

"407",406,"James McDaniel","Dostoyevsky accomplished something remarkable here. He created a book in which I care about the fate of literally none of the characters. Usually there are at least a couple. No here though. Raskolnikov particularly was annoying as all hell, but not even so much that I wanted bad things to happen to him. I just totally didn't care how his story ended. The only reason I finished it was so that I could say that I read the book. It did not hold my interest. It was overly psychological at the expense of developing the characters into real people whose lives I am concerned with. In stark contrast to this book stands East of Eden, my favorite book of all time. In that book, I cared deeply about every single character. Steinbeck made each one of them come to life and jump off the page. The characters in Crime and Punishment were utterly wooden and either two or one dimensional figures.It got 2 stars because Svidrigailov's character was (as they go) actually sort of cool. The way he exited the book (not saying how) was also bad ass."

There's this weird propensity people have on public review sites to want to look far more intellectual (or angsty or ""deep"" or ""with it"" -- depends on the genre) than we really are. It's the same reason everyone claims to have read Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time even though it consistently shows up on lists as one of the most abandoned reads ever. I'm sure there are legions of people who truly were moved by this book. I'm not one of them. If being unable to hang with the Russian authors and their brooding, verbose, deeply depressed state means I'm an intellectual lightweight, so be it. At least I'm not perpetually miserable, which they all certainly seemed to be. "
"428",427,"Lennox Brown","I'll be honest, I really struggled with this classic of modern literature. The first 1/3 of it is fantastic and involves the story of a young college student who decides to kill his landlady. After the deed is done, there is a cat-and-mouse game with the police during an interrogation that is gripping and competes with many modern day thrillers.And then everything changes. Our man wanders out of the police station and into a whole other novel. He hooks up with a family full of alcoholics and starts worrying about what kind of guy his sister is going to marry and the whole murder story is tossed aside. This always reeked to me of bad writing. It seemed to me that Dostoyevsky didn't know where else to take the story and just pulled another out of the drawer to tack onto the end. Much like the Beatles did on their later albums where bits and pieces of different, unrelated songs were tacked onto each other in ""medleys"" because they couldn't be bothered to actually develop the songs anymore. And because they are The Beatles, this is ""brilliant"" rather than ""lazy"".As it turned out, that's exactly what happened. Dostoyevsky had two short stories and lots of debts. One was the story of the man killing his landlady, another was the unrelated story called ""The Drunkards"" about a family of alcoholics and he just put them together in a ""medley"". But these two stories don't fit together. Their theme and tone are completely different and I never felt like they fit together very well.Granted, many think I'm daft and don't get the underlying meanings of the novel. Perhaps I'm not enough of an intellectual, but I am a writer and I do recognize lazy writing when I see it. What irks me so much is that the original story he starts with is so good and completely sucked me in. If he'd just finished that one he would have had me. As it is, it is now a badly dated novel written in a fashion that the author would never get away with today. Today's readers demand tightly-plotted, focused writing that doesn't deviate from the promises of what the story will be in the beginning.Am I wrong?"
"431",430,"Melissa Andrews","Not sure why this book didn't do it for me, as it's got a four-star average. I ""read"" it as an audiobook, and it dragged in several places. I did make it through the entire thing, and I was glad I finished it, but I didn't feel anything really for Raskonikoff (sp? since it was an audiobook and the characters are Russian, I'm not even going to pretend I know how to spell the names). If I were to compare this to ""Les Mes"" - not that they are comparable in any way other than they are huge classic tomes - I loved ""Les Mes"" - the characters there really had my attention and I was really rooting for the protagonist. In C&P, I was like, ""Ok, who cares if they catch him or not"". I know that must sound like heresy. My favorite characters were Rasumeken (sp?) and Sryligylov (sp?) - Martha's husband. Donia (sp's) first fiance was really a crud, and his character was well done - you really disliked him.Not one that I'd say I must read again. But not awful."

Book has a very strange quality about it. It is interesting in each individual chapter, yet on the whole story still doesn't move much. It goes on and on on unrelated parts and at some point starts annoying the reader on the point of it all. One thing which confused me is that all names are long Russian names and only parts of which are used at any one time. Say, a character is named 'A B C D' then he is referred as 'A B', 'B D', 'A C' etc. even in same paragraph and becomes difficult to track if same person is being talked about. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment#Characters) Further, overall large part of story is very emotional and goes on in minds of protagonists. Whole characterization seems unsympathetic and in the end I couldn't be bothered to care about it anymore. May be it requires reading between the lines and I could imagine others finiding this a masterpiece."

"446",445,"Glenn Short","I finished it and that was an accomplishment on it's own. This story is a good example of how it is always better to tell the truth or in the alternative, never murder someone.This book had some basic problems for me. The largest being that all the characters had at least two names and I had a difficult time keeping them straight. I could not empathize with the main character because of his actions. I did feel sorrow for his family and the fact that his actions put them through the wringer. I think that the main character did realize the wrongfulness of his actions and he becomes a better person for the future. I found the entire book dark and forbidding although the scenes that transpired at the very end of the book gave me hope for the future."
"450",449,"Kari","Giddy I get to put this in, ""Holy Jesus I finished it and I never have to read it EVER again!!"" category.Let me recap this book for you so you don't have to waste your life on it.Guy kills woman and feels really, really no really REALLY bad about it. And he obsessively talks about it to the point I wanted to kill him. Trust me I wouldn't have felt bad about it either.Wow, until I wrote this I had no idea how annoying I found this book.It gets two stars though because....Fine I'll admit its good Victorian writing. Its better then most of the rot from that time period. The characters are believable (for this genre). If you are the angst driven type and your looking for yet another existionalist moment your going to love this book.The rest of us? Do yourself a favor go read, hell I don't know.

"456",455,"Mahdieh"," قهرمان داستان دانشجوی جوانی است، به نام راسکولنیکوف که به سبب نداشتن امکانات مالی ناگزیر از ترک دانشگاه شده است. به سبب فقر ‌و علاوه بر آن -مخصوصا- به سبب ملاحظات اعتقادی، ‌به آنجا کشیده می‌شود که پیرزن رباخواری و خواهر او را می‌کشد. بخش اساسیی که سپس همه حوادث رمان به آن گره می‌خورد مبتنی بر پیچیدگی انگیزه‌هایی است که این جنایت را به بار می‌آورد. روح راسکولنیکوف تقریباً مانند آیینه‌ای است که علتهای اصلی آشوبهایی را که مشخصه عصر او و سرزمین او بود، با آمیختن آنها به یکدیگر، ‌منعکس می‌کند. این علتها ناشی از آرمانهای اجتماعی مارکس و نظریه «ابرمرد» نیچه و نیز عرفان مسیحایی انکار نفسی بود که داستایفسکی عمیقاً در روح ملت روس احساس می‌کرد.دو اندیشه در روح راسکولنیکوف، ‌به نحوی تقریباً آزارنده،‌ پیوسته یکی جانشین دیگری می‌شود: یکی کار نیکی است که او خواهد توانست با پولی بکند که پیرزن رباخوار پنهان کرده و آن را از تیره‌بختانی دزدیده است که از روی ناچاری به او متوسل شده‌اند‌ و دیگری قدرت تصاحب این پول به هر وسیله ی ممکن و صرف آن در راه عادلانه‌ترین مقاصد. قدرتی که از آنِ روحهای برتر و فارغ از هرگونه اخلاق قراردادی است. این دو نظریه به کلی متضاد با یکدیگرند؛ ‌یکی متوجه آرمانی بشردوستانه است و دیگری متوجه نظریه« ابرمرد»ی است که انسانها را قویاً به دو گروه تقسیم می‌کند: مردمان عادی و «برگزیدگان». با این همه، به نظر راسکولنیکوف‌،‌ می‌توان این تضاد را با جنایت از میان برداشت. وانگهی از یک سو راسکولنیکف با یک سلسله نمونه‌هایی که از همه جهات مؤید احساسات درونی اویند خود را در این اندیشه راسخ می‌یابد. در حقیقت،‌ از ازدواج شرم آوری آگاه می‌شود که خواهر،‌ برای اینکه بتواند به او یاری دهد و آرامش مادرش را در روزگار پیری تأمین کند،‌ به آن تن در داده است (بنابراین ، ‌قتل پیرزن رباخوار خواهد توانست روح شریفی را از بدبختی نجات دهد)؛ از سوی دیگر،‌ جوان به یک دلیل تاریخی هم در تأیید نظریه خود درباره «برگزیدگان» توسل می‌جوید. موفقیت ناپلئون از روزی آغاز شد که امپراتور آینده برای دفاع از قانون اساسی، ‌بی‌اندک تردیدی،‌ جمعیت بی‌دفاعی را به رگبار گلوله بست. او از این چنین نتیجه می‌گیرد که تنها کسی که می‌تواند صاحب استقلال روحی کامل باشد شایسته کارهای بزرگ است. این استقلال، ‌در عین آنکه او را در مقامی برتر از عامه مردمان جای می‌دهد، به او امکان می‌دهد که زندگی مردم را در دست خود بگیرد و کسانی را که برای اهداف عالی‌تر ناتوان یا زیان‌آورند قربانی کند. از این رو، راسکولنیکوف نقشه خود را با خونسردی کسی که خیال را واقعیت می‌پندارد طرح می‌کند و آن را به اجرا در می‌آورد و خسته و مانده از کوششی که به کار برده است، محل جنایت را با غنیمت بسیار ناچیزی ترک می‌گوید. از همان لحظه در عمق وجود خود احساس می‌کند که شکست خورده است. پولی که ربوده است حتی برای برآوردن اندکی از آرمان عدالت‌خواهی او نیز کفایت نمی‌کند. وانگهی اعصاب لرزان او حکایت از آن دارد که آن استقلال اخلاقیی را که همواره فضیلت اساسی روحهای برگزیده می‌دانسته است هرگز به دست نیاورده است.با این همه، ‌راسکولنیکوف نمی‌خواهد اعتراف کند که شکست خورده است: او می‌داند که نتیجه از مقدمات فراتر رفته است و اشتباه دردناکی را در خود نهفته دارد؛‌ ولی او در اقدام خود پافشاری می‌کند. بنابراین، زندگی‌اش در دو زمینه متمایز گسترش می‌یابد: یکی عمیقاً عاطفی که در آن سرشت او،‌ که به نحوی غریزی همبسته بینوایان است،‌ خودنمایی می‌کند؛ دیگری زمینه‌ای است که در آن نظریه نا روشن او جریان دارد. وجه خارجی رمان گرد موقعیتی که او ایجاد کرده است می‌چرخد. این وسوسه آزارنده و دغدغه خاطر، او را ترغیب می‌کند که خود را به جویندگان قاتل معرفی کند و آشکارا به جنایت خود اعتراف کند تا بتواند آن را مورد بحث قرار دهد و توجیه کند و از عذاب وحشتناک وجدان رنج می‌برد، ‌چندان که به فکر خودکشی می‌افتد. قاضی پورفیری پتروویچ که کار رسیدگی به ماجرای قتل را بر عهده دارد به راز او پی می‌برد،‌ ولی منتظر می‌ماند تا راسکولنیکوف خود به گناه خود اعتراف کند. می‌خواهد او را دستگیر کند که ناگهان اعتراف دروغین کارگری مبتلا به توهم که خود را قاتل معرفی می‌کند، وضع را پیچیده می‌سازد. ابهام ماجرا،‌ پس از یک سلسله وقایع که مهم‌ترین آنها ملاقات راسکولنیکوف و سونیا مارملادوف،‌ دختر جوانی که تن به روسپیگری می‌دهد تا به خانواده خود کمک کند و برادران خردسالش را از گرسنگی نجات دهد، ‌گشوده می‌شود. سونیا با وجود زندگی یأس‌آمیز خود پاکی ضمیرش را حفظ کرده است، ‌و همین است که راسکولنیکوف را دلبسته او می‌کند. سونیا او را ترغیب می‌کند که نزد پلیس به گناه خود اعتراف کند. ولی مدتی می‌گذرد تا سرانجام این تصفیه روح صورت می‌گیرد. راسکولتیکوف محکوم به تبعید به سیبری می‌شود،‌ ولی همچنان معتقد است که جنایتی مرتکب نشده است،‌ بلکه فقط اشتباه کرده و قتل بیهوده‌ای انجام داده ‌است. سونیا همراه او به تبعیدگاه می‌رود، ‌و همین حضور سونیا است که او را از وسوسه می‌رهاند و سبب غلبه قطعی احساس همبستگی انسانی او می‌شود.  در پیرامون این واقعه وقایع دیگری با همان شدت درامی روی می‌دهد: مانند مورد خانواده مارملادوف،‌ که پدر الکلی و خشن آن،‌ تنها با شیفتگیی که به زن دومش، ‌کاترینا ایوانوونا،‌ و عشقی که به دختر خود،‌ سونیا، دارد زنده است، در عین آنکه می‌داند که زندگی هر دوی آنها را با فقر و عیب خود تباه کرده است. در مقایسه با او،‌شخصیت کاترینا برجستگی می‌یابد. کاترینا دخترخوانده خود را وادار به خودفروشی می‌کند، ‌ولی شبی را درکنار او در گریستن بدبختیهای خود و بوسیدن دست او به نشانه سپاس‌گذاری می‌گذراند. به موازات اینها وقایع دیگری روی می‌دهد که مربوط به دونیا، خواهر راسکولینکوف است؛‌ دونیا قبول کرده است که با مرد مرفه و ناتراشیده‌ای به نام لوگین ازدواج کند. پس از آنکه برادرش موفق می‌شود که ازدواج به شکست بکشاند، ملاکی که دونیا یک چند در خانه او آموزگار بوده است درصدد اغفال او برمی‌آید و برای ازدواج با او زن خود را مسموم می‌کند. این جنایتکار یک شب موفق می‌شود که دختر جوان را به خانه خود بکشاند. دونیابا رولور از خود دفاع می‌کند و مرد که به شناعت کار خود پی می‌برد خود را می‌کشد"

"461",460,"Christoffer","Classic 19th century. It is well known that Dostoyevsky needed to write a few hundred pages before he gets going with the plot. Crime and Punishment is no exception. It is however interesting to note that Dostoyevsky had great faith in psychology as an instrument of crime, which is clearly expressed in Crime and Punishment. Nevertheless, Dostoyevsky remains a writer for those with special interests, and those who are pretentious assholes (which however are more fond of quoting Dostoyvesky rather than reading him)."

I loved the comedy, the plot, the intricacies of the relationships between the characters, but found myself too often distracted and unable to keep track of all the characters with their name, casual name, and their relevance to the story. I really wanted to finish this book, but unfortunately, I felt that I was I reading at 1/2 the speed with 1/2 the interest, so I was probably enjoying it 25% of how much I might typically enjoy a book.

Un ou deux personnages étaient sympathiques, le reste... bof. Et le personnage principal m'insupporte, donc voilà, ça, c'est fait.Je ne suis pas mécontente de l'avoir lu, mais je ne retenterai pas l'aventure, et pour ce qui est de la littérature russe, j'essaierai peut-être à l'avenir des choses plus modernes.

"510",509,"Beccamonstrosity","I think I ought to give the book a second chance, though the translation we were given in school was very poor and left those unfamiliar with the Russian culture of apparently having at least five nicknames per character threw everyone off.

There wasn't anything to keep me interested. "
"519",518,"Desertorum","This was my second russian classic, after Anna Karenina. And I must say that this felt a bit too slow. The idea in the book is interesting and people´s feelings are described very lively. I could almost feel the fever and anguish. But in the middle there were a lot long rambling and some of the feelings were almost overly done. I would have liked it more it it were more compact. The style of the writing was very similar to Tolstoy, I´m not sure if that´s got something to do with translation or do russian writers use similar style. Interesting read and I´m glad I made it."

"532",531,"Callie","Just finished this for the 2nd time. I hated it just as much as I remembered. Raskolnikov is an first class dunce and an egotistical maniac to boot. Why in the name of all that is good and holy would Sonya agree to be with him?? Razumhkin- total glutton for punishment, like masochistic or something. I read the majority of this in the translation by Vorozhenskya (spelling??)It was extremely disjointed and jerky, didn't make sense in many places. The last bit I read in the translation that is available at the Goodreads link. It seemed much more readable. Dostoyevsky....."

"550",549,"Lindsey","I couldn't get past the first couple of chapters. Dostoyevsky describes the murder scene so well that my stomach turned and I felt sick for the rest of the day. I decided that it wasn't worth finishing 'cause of my weak stomach, but it was very well written and Dostoyevsky began delving into some excellent themes and ideas."
"554",553,"Constance","I can understand why it is a classic, but would not want to read it twice. Dostoevsky delves into the mind of a psychopath, writes about his internal struggle and how his conscience wouldn't let him get away with premediatated, random murder. I almost feel corrupted for reading it."
"557",556,"Peter","Good, not an easy read. "
"562",561,"Tiredstars","The first great classic to get a mediocre rating from me. Reading this review back I am reminded of some things I liked tempted to go for three stars. I think it's social pressure though, and I'm not remember that the book made so little impact on me I'm not sure I've thought about it at all since I read it. So, rating disclaimer: it's all subjective, blahblahblah. Feel free to tell me all the things I missed or didn't appreciate about the book.Someone at my work told me she didn't finish Crime and Punishment because she just didn't care about the protagonist Raskolnikov. I can see her point. He's not meant to be liked, but it can be hard to engage with a character who spends most of his time wandering around muttering and being unpleasant to people (some of whom deserve it and some of whom don't).I also had some trouble finishing it; it's one of those books that you keep thinking is about to end but carries on. There are just about enough engaging sideplots and characters though, from Rasumikhin (a sort of paragon of Russian virtue) to the tragic Mrs Marmeladov to the unpleasant Mr Luzhin getting what he deserves. I liked the portrayal of mid 1800s St Petersburg, with its dust, drunkeness and poverty, cynicism, despair and idealism and its inequalities, where a man like Svidrigaylov, who has money but doesn't care for it can make such a difference to so many people's lives. I also liked the portrayal of how hunger and illness affect Raskolnikov's judgement and behaviour.For the main themes of the book, I'm not sure. Dostoevsky's cardinal virtues appear to be the acceptance of suffering, balanced in its negativism by generosity. Though progressivism is often shown in a positive light, particularly in Razumikhin, conservatism, or at least political disengagement, seem to underly the story. Anyway, the point is not so much that I didn't pin down the morals to the story, rather that it didn't inspire me to think more or better about them."
"564",563,"Brandon O'Neill"," ""...our present narrative is, however, at an end"" (p. 656). Sweeter words were never written. I know this is a classic that will be long remembered, but it never totally clicked for me. It was long, plodding, and I didn't like the main character. There is something to be said abotu finishing it, but I don't know what that would be. "
"566",565,"Caroline Pelletier","Too much."
"567",566,"Nate Hanson","By the end, I almost wished I'd gone to prison with Rodion, rather than endure the cruel and unusual punishment of reading this. Perhaps my crime was expecting to get something more out of it the second time through. I had hoped that I could blame the miserable torture of the first read on adolescence, but sadly I just found the same absurdly unbelievable caricatures, hyperbolic melodrama, trite and suffocating moralism, and excruciatingly tedious monologues disguised as dialogues. Perhaps if I were better (at all) acquainted with 19th c. Russian mannerisms, the conversations may have felt less like a series of operatic, non sequitur expositories. I will grant it was good for its time, anticipating Nietsche, libertarians, and other philosophical quackery by decades. And Dostoevsky had a better understanding of the subconscious than many Freudians much later. The book deserves credit for a great many other things that other reviewers have dwelled on at length. But this rant of impotent frustration is my only compensation for the time lost trying to find plausibility and relevance in 505 tiresome pages."
"569",568,"Dawn","There are nuggets of good story and interesting points of philosophy, but just too much feverish pacing to suit me. "
"570",569,"Graham","This was a real struggle to read. I started this book in 2005 and have picked at it every now and then. Any excuse to read another book and I took it. I finally decided to knock it over and forced myself through the last half in the weeks holiday after xmas 2012. The topic is very grim - a mentally unstable man, Raskolnikov, murders an old woman he owes money to (using a bizarre rationalization to justify his actions) in the early part of the book. The rest of the book then deals with his friends and family fussing around him until his guilt is uncovered.I believe this would've been a ground breaking novel in it's day but it just isn't a genre that I enjoy. I wanted to0 read it as it is highy rated and I'm glad I have and even happier that the experience is over."
"572",571,"Timothy","I feel bad for giving this classic a poor rating but the book was REALLY slow. While I enjoyed the discussion on social roles and classes as well as the questions around morality, the book just couldn't keep my attention. I suppose my views of justice are too black and white. Raskolnikov was overly dramatic and Dimitri overly ignorant. The parts of the book I thought should go quick dragged on while the parts I thought should linger flashed by. I did really enjoy the picture of human nature and questions surrounding morale law and I very much enjoyed some of Fyodor's wit and eloquence (I imagine it was probably better in Russian...but alas - I speak it not). But I found the book a little over the top in drama...maybe our modern culture and entertainment has desensitized me..."
"574",573,"Agostino Scafidi","This book. Wow. It's a monster. It's a behemoth. It's a trip into darkness, boredom, excitement, frustration. I can't say that I loved it and I don't think I can even say that I liked it, there were definitely many times where I hated it. There were just a few moments throughout this book where I really enjoyed what I was reading, the rest to me was what I considered to be just shy of rubbish. Blabbering. Pointless literature.I admit that this was my first foray into Russian literature. I am not however averse or unfamiliar with challenging writing. For example I have read various 19th century literature, I've read Dickens too, not to mention some Honoré de Balzac. I think I had a bit of a hard time dealing with the pressure that classics can impose on a reader. What I mean by that is if you were to take epics like War and Peace, The Count of Monte Cristo or even Crime and Punishment, there seems to be a consensus out there that these books are ""must reads"". You simply might look like an ignoramus or something if you dislike or even avoid reading classics such as those, at least that's what I had in mind before delving into this book.If there is one thing I've taken away from this book, one thing I've truly learned, it's that I will never wonder or feel guilty about putting a book down halfway through ever again. I will never feel like I am missing out if I refuse to read a 1000 page ""classic"".I had to force myself to finish Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. I don't regret doing it because I have this blog post and this personal lesson as a result.**Copied from my original blog post at http://thehermitrant.blogspot.ca"

"598",597,"Cansu Ashley Bradford","I never actually finished reading this book, but we discussed it in class, so I have an understanding of what happened in the end. The book and characters were quite interesting. The part I didn't enjoy reading was the epilogue (it was very short and I read it during class). It seemed to drift away from the tone of the rest of the novel. Also, it was highly unrealistic; it reminded me of a fairy-tale ending. I think that this ending was necessary so that Dostoyevsky could prove his point, but I firmly disagree with him. I'm trying not to spoil the story for others. Sorry if this is too vague... Basically Dostoyevsky does not like the whole ""western"" movement. He doesn't like reasoning and calculations. He thinks that the world is the way it is, and that we should accept it. Throughout the entire book, he makes it seem like calculating and thinking through reason is almost evil... a bad thing! The main character,whose name I will not attempt to spell unless the book is in front me, is a confused (and rather confusing) man. In the epilogue, he chooses a path of redemption for what he has done. In my opinion, the way this is played out perfectly coincides with Dostoyevsky's outlook on the way life should be. But let's think realistically (opposite of what Dostoyevsky would want us to do). This is not the way life plays out. This is not the way life SHOULD play out. I feel like I can't say much without giving the plot away... To those who read my review, I don't think that this is a terrible read. It was very interesting. The epilogue, however killed it for me. "
"599",598,"Rachael Barratt","Well. To be honest I am not sure what to say. I have very mixed views about this book.On the one hand I didn't really want to pick it up and read it, it was not a book that I looked forward to reading at the end of a busy day. Yet, once I did pick it up, I found it difficult to put down.I do feel that the story could have been told in many many less pages. Man kills. Man goes mad. Man confesses. Man goes to prison. Man falls in love. Why does that story take over 10 hours to read! I understand that we get to see insights into the killers mind and indeed into the minds of the people around him. However, I didn't really connect with any of these characters, so wasn't that interested in what they were thinking about. All I wanted to know was what was going to happen to the main character.I also did not understand why the women in his life were so understanding and forgiving either.It was all a little strange. In the end I gave it 2 stars, as I appreciated what the author was trying to do, but it just wasn't for me"

"617",616,"Sonatajessica","Again, I read a classic and am stunned by all the positive and adoring reviews. I didn't hate it, I can see a certain appeal, but I see many flaws, too, and it stuns me that not more readers are bothered with those.To start on good terms, I deeply enjoyed the writing, Dostoyesky's style is lively and engaging, many dialogues and paragraphs I enjoyed reading just for the use of language and the playful interaction between the characters. There are interesting ideas, pondering sometimes more on the surface, sometimes being more of secret find, ideas concerning not just crime and punishment, but guilt, remorse, responsibilities and redemption, too.And I think that's where it ends, I don't think I can say more positive things, maybe that I liked it more than reading Tolstoi which might only proof that Russian literature is not for me (which might be true indeed). But was nobody annoyed by the change of narrative perspective? Written in third person, still, for about 200 pages we only get the view of Raskolnikov, his thoughts and his knowledge, suddenly then a chapter from Razumkhin's POV, it happens several times, that we get one or two chapters with a side character as the protagonist, always when it seemed convenient for the plot to give the reader knowledge that Raskolnikov couldn't have. I really dislike it when writers turn inconsistent in their narration because they cannot figure out a better way to present things, to me that's what happened here.I am not going to complain about this novel being overly wordy and having too many side tangents, some people seem to enjoy that in classics even though every good editor would cut pages after pages out, what I want to complain about though is the weird element of chance the plot uses to move along. Several times characters eavesdrop on crucial information, just happen to live next door, talk in feverish dreams (what was up with everybody getting sick when distressed anyway??). It took realism out of it, again it seemed like there was no other solution to reveal plot points and interweb characters; I didn't care for it.As much as I enjoyed the dialogue I thought the characters were often crafted poorly, or maybe I don't get Russian culture a century ago, people were offended and angered by the weirdest things, had constant mood swings and could never control themselves. The love interest Sonya was more of a joke than a real person ((view spoiler)[ turning into a prostitute to support her family and constantly drunk father, after her parents die she gives the children to foster parents and instantly lives for Raskolnikov only??? This is not being good, it is being not a person  (hide spoiler)]). Women had to take some disrespectful remarks and whereas I don't blame Dostoyevsky or the time, I still don't enjoy reading like that.Some comments on our protagonist, who mostly seemed like a whiny wimp who couldn't live up to his own believes. I was really annoyed that no one payed attention to the fact that he (view spoiler)[ killed two people, all his justifications with thinking he belonged to a certain type of persons who can commit bad deeds for a higher good seemed to ignore that he killed the sister only to get away with the first crime. Several times he himself stated the pawn broker was ""a louse"" further justifying his deed, nobody cared much about the second victim not even himself.  (hide spoiler)] I was annoyed that the paper he wrote which in parts explains his actions and motivations was introduced as an 'add-on', in the first roughly hundred pages where he goes over what he is intending to do and why there is no mention of that concept at all, it seemed to me as if Dostoyevksy came up with that later to bring more substance to the plot. Or maybe I didn't get it, that is always a possibility. But maybe, watch out for blasphemic comment, Dostoyevsky didn't craft his novel all that perfectly. It probably is just me.To sum up, I can see how people like parts of this but the huge appeal is a mystery to me, classic writings often are. I sometimes think that maybe I am the only cow not following the herd and am able to admit that I don't see it, or maybe I don't see it because I am a cow. Whatever the truth is, I might give classic Russian literature a last third chance by trying Pushkin or Gogol but not in the too near future."

"621",620,"Chris S","Finally finished the damn thing. The novel grew very tedious and dreary as it progressed. The principle character - Raskolnikov - I found very irritating and a self obsessed little twerp. I accept that this is a 'classic' and admire some of the more vivid writing, but ultimately reading it became a chore. "
"622",621,"Garnet","If you adore this book, then you should probably not read this comment. The only reason I gave this book two stars was because Dostoyevsky had a real talent in keeping all the characters straight. The book started out interesting, the reader wondering what will happen and what Raskolnikov had in mind to do. As the book went on, I kept saying to myself that something interesting will happen. Other than gruesome event that occurred, (not saying anything about it though for people that haven't gotten far in the book or started it) nothing interesting happened. This book also left me disappointed in the uneventful ending. Many people talked about how it had so much insight into human thought and feelings and all that stuff, but I could've figured the moral out by myself without reading 600 pages of this book. Most people would feel guilty about killing someone unless they were a psychopath. While the book was written nicely, it just essentially lacked a plot to me. I wouldn't stop anyone from reading this, in fact I encourage that people give it a try, I was just disappointed."

Poate că este o capodoperă, însă nu-i chiar pe stilul meu. Nu mi-a plăcut foarte mult, sinceră să fiu.

"668",667,"Carmen","While I read this book, I kept thinking, ""This is just a very verbose retelling of Edgar Allen Poe's short story A Tell-Tale Heart"". That may be a bit simplistic, but at the heart, they are the same. Both men commit murder for the stupidest of reasons, albeit different. Both men are crazed and even more so afterward, becoming paranoid. Both men break at the end and confess. The difference is, Poe was able to tell his version in a compelling short story while Dostoevsky must have been paid by the word.  I found a few things irritating and hindered the flow, but perhaps that was the intention. The most glaring, cumbersome and repetitive was the mood swings of the main character, Raskolnikov. I would think that if it were a literary tool, his swings would have been more pronounced later in the story, as his situation progressed. However, he was bipolar from the beginning with no apparent trigger.  Another odd recurring action was men falling in love with Dunya, Raskolnikov's sister. Three men over the course of the novel fell for her. She was either very beautiful, which I didn't perceive, or they were in desperate times.  Why this book is such a studied classic is beyond me. Even as verbose as it is, it is well-written (if I can say that about a translation) and not beyond reading. However, I didn't enjoy the read and found that I finished it out of a sense of responsibility. I hold fast to my thought that Poe's short story is much more worth the time and analysis. To do the same thing in a fraction of the words, and 23 years earlier than Dostoevsky gets my attention.  Read if you have to, but I cannot recommend it. "
"669",668,"Matt M","Tldr: don't murder old ladies otherwise you'll puke until you confess.I may be slightly too brutal in my judgment, but this book was a pain to read. I found Roskalnikov not compelling at all, his psychosomatic illness to be too much of a ""the world is punishing youuuu"" theme, and the overall moralism quite flat. Besides, ""redemption through suffering"" is a rather boring idea: it would be so much better if Roskalnikov came to repent through an actual moral change, rather than just because he felt like dirt.Sure, don't murder old ladies. We agree with Dostoyevski that it's a bad thing to do. But, if someone wants to write a book on the morality of murder, I'd like to find some more finesse than puking-as-the-reason-to-change-your-mind."
"672",671,"Ashley Cunningham","I don't like depressing stories, even though it seems my high school English teacher decided to give them to my class in great amount.This book is just... well, I can't really describe it, but I didn't like it. Basically, a man commits murder and becomes wrought with guilt over his crime. The character I most hated was the prostitute with the ""heart of gold"" who was deeply religious (a contradiction, if you think about it) who encouraged the protagonist to reveal what he had done."

"684",683,"Ruchira Bibliophile Banerjee","Weirdly enough, this book just didn't do it for me. A very blunt, simple fact.Despite reading numerous other reviews in favor of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, I really could not find it in myself to rate this book any more than two stars.Of course, that probably had something to do with the fact that this was a school assigned book, but that still did not play a major role in my apparent aversion towards the novel. For some inexplicable reason, I found the plot extremely slow and extremely dragged out. So much so, in fact, that I, at one point, gave up on the book, and then picked it up again purely out of academic compulsion.That does not, however, mean that I did not appreciate the author's brilliant take on the psychology of a murderer, or get fascinated by his array of characters. I do provide Dostoyevsky with that much credit.But once again, that said, I really would have preferred if there were a 100 or so pages less in the book. Preferably the ones that had nothing but Raskolnikov falling ill in them."

"690",689,"K.G. White","Dostoyevsky is an incredible writer, and this is considered one of his more mature works. This book focuses on the issue of moral dilemmas and the anguish associated with them, thus the book is very depressing and melancholy. Dostoyevsky's nihilistic personality is on flagrant display. We begin with our protagonist, Rodion Raskolnikov. He is an educated, but impoverished man in St. Petersburg, Russia who devises a plan to rob and murder and pawnbroker. Raskolnikov rationalizes that he can do morally upright things with the money he steals in order to cancel out the crime he committed to obtain the cash. He later committs murder to test his theory that some people are just born capable of such violence and should therefore do what is in their nature to do, without apology. Raskolnikov is able to justify everything, believing that these acts are permissible because they serve a greater purpose. Raskolnikov, himself, represents the hazardous ideals circling around Dostoyevsky at the time of the novel's conception. His utilitarian/altruistic justifications for his crimes reflect the ideals of the radical's sentiments. The reader can conclude that there is self-deception and egoism inherent, and that this single-minded logic is just as dangerous as religious doctrine. This book is incredibly meaningful as a component of Dostoyevsky's entire body of work as well as a historical document that reflects the attitudes and socio-political climate of Russian at the time. "
"693",692,"Ebba","One of those books that you should read and then when you finally read it you realise it's actually not that good. Read it if you want to be able to say that you've read it, but tbh you're not missing out if you don't."

However, the next 400 pages were slow and difficult to get through for the most part. I thought the climax occurred too early causing the rest of the book to seem boring.

"721",720,"Christine Blachford","I had heard some reports that this book was quite difficult to read and a tough job to get through, so I was relieved when I started it and found it okay. Travelling with Raskolnikov on his journey to and from the pawnbroker was a good start, listening to his thoughts as he pondered killing her. A bit odd, but we'll go with it.As soon as more people were added to the mix though, I found it really hard to keep up with all the characters. It seemed like each one went by at least three different names, and there were people floating in and out of the story making it difficult to follow. I could always get a general sense of what was going on, but found it tough to delve right into the heart of it.I had thought it would be more of a psychoanalysis of the killing motive, but it really only kept repeating the questions and never going beneath the surface to find the answer. Overall, I don't really know where to place the book. I didn't particularly enjoy reading it but it wasn't awful either. I was glad that the ending was reasonably happy, as I had thought it was descending into one of those where everyone dies in the end. It didn't, and that was a relief!"

One of the hardest books for me to get into though. "

When I read it the first time I liked it just fine, but this time around I found Raskolnikov unbearable - his mood swings, his arrogance, his hysterics, his brutality. I can't in any way identify with him, as he is such an artificial character. But what really made this painful: It was boring. It's amazing, as this book contains two gruesome murders, two additional dramatic deaths (accident and sickness resulting in three orphans), one suicide, one attempted blackmail and rape, a broken engagement, two couples falling in love and so on and so forth. You might expect a lot of action. But you'd be wrong. Because there is a lot of monologues and long dialogues, a lot of meandering talks. Not my type of book. There was really nothing poignant in it. And so the action swam in to much talk for my taste.The theme - Raskolnikov's belief in his ""right"" to murder as he is ""special"" - was probably very original and controversial when it was written. I rate this low, because I didn't enjoy it very much - not because I think it was a bad book. It did have some more interesting parts, but mostly I just tried to finish it as fast as possible. And, really, what felt like 80 different Russian names made it not really easy to follow the story - sometimes I had to go back pages to understand if the commissar was speaking or Raskolnikov's friend or someone else altogether..."

Interesting relationship between the detective/prosecutor and the guilty protagonist. But I'm not sure why the book is such a classic. I suspect it has something to do with the psychological problems brought on by the main character's guilt. But ho hum, I was unmoved. In addition, the Russian character names--all polysyllabic names beginning with the letter ""R""--are terribly confusing.

Raskolnikov is probably the most annoying character I have ever read about, and I really can't stand him. I never really felt sorry for him, because he was so obnoxious, and a murderer, so I really felt that he got everything he deserved. There was a ridiculous amount of description in these books, particularly about Raskolnikov's life, which I think was part of his insanity...or at least, that's what I describe it as. He almost has schizophrenia or something...I can't describe it. I think the description, while being extremely annoying, showed things from his perspective, making the reader realize how mentally not right this man is. I didn't personally enjoy this book, but I understand how significant it is and how unique it is, because it shows an insane murderer's perspective on life in a very realistic way. It also highlighted Russian society in a way that, for me, was very powerful. It showed social classes and distinctions, and how the Russian people view people based on their professions. It was a very interesting read for me, but very investing, so I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants an easy-to-understand classic."
"760",759,"تميم التميمي","ما حبيتها كثير ومملة !"
"761",760,"Frank Peters","This was a strange book. It was both brilliant and dreadful. One reviewer I read claimed that reading the book was “crime and punishment”, and for about one quarter of the book I quite agree. That portion of the book was stress encapsulated onto print. Normally, I read to relax after a potentially stressful day at work. But, for this quarter of the book, I was unable to do so, as the act of reading was far from relaxing. After getting through the difficult part, the book certainly became easier, but only became enjoyable right near the very end. So if the book was not enjoyable, why would I read it? The reason is because of what Dostoyevsky has to offer, which is insight in to the inner psyche of men, as well as a beautiful view of forgiveness and redemption. The author is apparently unable to understand women (not that I would know, but I am told this by those I can trust), so those characters are unfortunately insubstantial albeit likable. Would I recommend the book to others? Unfortunately, not likely. I am not sure the insights that the book had to offer were worth the effort of the reading. "

"777",776,"Chunju","First off, I’d like to say that Crime and Punishment is probably a wonderful work of literature, but I just personally don’t like it. I had trouble reading the book, and an even harder time trying to keep up with Raskolnikov. It was an altogether confusing experience for me (and not to mention depressing).One of the smaller problems that I had reading Crime and Punishment was that I couldn’t remember all of the names of the characters and places. All of the names in the book are Russian (since it was written by a Russian), and I had a hard time associating the long and foreign sounding names to the characters and places. By the time I got to the end of the book, this wasn’t a problem anymore, but the beginning of the book was very confusing to me.Then there’s Raskolnikov himself. I have to admit that I’m very impressed with Dostoyevsky for being able to write a character with such a strange personality. That strange personality is what gets me though. I can’t keep up with the guy! His constant changes in mood and thought processes never ceased to confuse me. Maybe if I kept rereading parts of what Raskolnikov thinks and says I would get the whole picture.Crime and Punishment is definitely not a book for the casual reader. Don’t read this book if you’re looking for an easy read or a feel-good book, because this is neither of those. If you’re a literature buff and can keep up with bipolar people, than go an ahead!"
"780",779,"Chris Gager","Reading this book is punishment enough. Maybe if I tried as an adult I could get through and maybe even like it but in prep school it was impossible.

"805",804,"Lynne","As an English teacher and a lover of literature, I feel blasphemous not giving a better review of this classic novel. But I must be honest! I did not enjoy it. I found it long-winded; I never have been a fan of paragraphs that go on for pages at a time. My attention span was never trained to hold out that long. I struggle with Russian names, all of which sound too much like each other--especially when one character goes by three different names throughout the story! I found myself zoning out rather often as I dug in my heels and worked to finish this book about a man who, out of desperation to rid himself of poverty and pull himself up to the expectations he thinks rely on his shoulders, murders a pawn woman and her unfortunate sister (whom happens upon him right after he has killed her sister). After months of getting away with the crime, despite certain suspicions of some characters, a delirium wrought from guilt, it is his genuine affection for those he loves that drives him to tell the truth. Unless you are a person who honestly enjoys Victorian-era Russian literature for fun, I don't recommend reading this outside of a college classroom. At least then you are getting credit for it, and have the benefit of a professor who knows how to generate discussion out of the pages."

"807",806,"Jen Leithauser","I'm not going to lie....this one was kind of boring..."
"809",808,"Shelley","Way too long for such an anti-climatic ending. I wish I had read it in school though so I would have been able to disect it more."
"810",809,"Callistalauren","Boring, disturbing. But I bought it... so I kinda liked it. "
"813",812,"Story","Somehow I missed ever being assigned this for school so I read it last year. I'm sure I just lack an appreciation for good literature but I found it dark, repetitive, and feared it would never end. Then when it was over I was glad I'd read it but perhaps just so I could say I had. It did have a lot of good passages, I just wished I'd read an abridged version."
"821",820,"Kristi","I am not sure how to feel about this book. In some ways, the writing style and the flavor of the culture/period resembled War and Peace, which I loved. They also both dealt with the themes of being bound by the culture, seeking positive change, and the human response to suffering. However, the similarities ended there. W&P was filled with themes of fall/redemption, seeking God, and becoming a better, stronger, truer person. C&P was a morass of self-focus, mind games, self-deception, and pride. What bothered me was that these attributes were presented with honor. The protagonist was represented as noble and forward-thinking, but all I could see was self, self, self. His thoughts and behaviors were thoroughly selfish and unloving towards those he professed to love, and yet he was presented as a martyr. Horrid. And don't even get me started on the weak, helpless, impractical women who let themselves be walked all over by the men in their lives. And it was presented in the story that this was OK, even normal and expected. I believe than an author’s world view comes through loud and clear in the subtext of the story. While reading Tolstoy I get the impression that he is a humble, contemplative man. Dostoyevsky seems to me the epitome of prideful, self-centered intellectualism. "
"825",824,"Moriahart","Dostoevsky is an excellent writer. I just don't really enjoy his work. He's very good at wringing you dry emotionally. Crime and Punishment in particular left me in a dark mood until I finished the book. I was also unhappy with the double ending, a little bit of politics there perhaps."
"826",825,"Doug E.","D is one of my top 5 favorite authors, but this book didn't really do it for me like some of the others. I thought the character was a little unrealistic than he could have been. I like the discussion of his theory that maybe some people should be able to get away with committing crimes."

"839",838,"Sabrina","I'm reading this book because I'm teaching it to my AP English class... I tried to read it a couple of summers ago, and just couldn't do it... We'll see how it goes!"
"840",839,"Ashish","The problem with classics is if you don't like them, you begin to question yourself. One such classic is this book ""Crime and punishment"". I am not a big fan of tedious thought description that is not leading anywhere. And that essentially is the big problem with this book. 200 pages in and I was tired of the detailed description of Raskolnikov's delirium. And it doesn't get any better. All in all, it will probably be several months before I even attempt to read another Dostoyevsky novel."
"842",841,"Fran Lewis","glad to have finally read this book. i found the names were very long and so similar that I often had to go back and reread to ensure I was thinking of the correct character. Overall an interesting read. "
"845",844,"Lissa","Around 8 or 9 years ago I purchased this book and read roughly two thirds before I set it aside never to come back to it. It wasn't that I found the writing style obtuse or that I just didn't get it, though some might argue for the latter, but I simply could not empathize with Raskolnikov's mental anguish nor with the rational, or lack thereof, for his crime. "
"848",847,"Tommy","Well, that took my just a shade over 5 months. As Scooter would say: SMOKIN JESUS TITTIES CINNAMON THAT WAS A TOUGH READ. The ideas and psychology behind the actions and reaction of Raskolnikov are interesting and thought provoking, as is the dialougue. The thoughts provoked by the dialogue, however are ""Does everyone in Russia have ADD? Maybe we could stick to topic, comrade. Oh, you're going off topic? Better use 4 pages, unsullied by paragraphs, to expound on your tangent about 19th century Russian economic classes. No really, shut up."" I wonder if great writing is maybe 90% as great after translation. I enjoy a rambling book. I love Moby Dick and Les Miserables and Count of Monte Cristo (Looking at you, frenchies) and those books devote entire chapters to things that have nothing to do with the story line. Every time I picked up this book, and the narrative wasn't being moved along, WHICH WAS OFTEN, I was struggling to retain what I was reading without daydreaming about god knows what, or just falling asleep. I've never read a book where I would pick it up, and not even make it through a chapter before laying it down and shutting my eyes as often as Crime and Punishment. THAT BEING SAID, I liked the story. It makes you ask questions about yourself, and that's my very favorite thing about any kind of art. At times you really feel the struggles and turmoil Raskolnikov is going through. A lot of the time you just feel drowsy. Maybe I just don't like Russian literature. That's good, cause I only have like 4 or 5 more books by Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy to go. War and Peace should be a year's worth for a dullard like yours truly. Anyway, it was hard, but the end of the book was fairly thrilling and left you with a happy feeling without too much ""happily ever after"" fluff. I'll never read it again, but am glad to have read it. Not like that filthy turd ""Pride and Prejudice."" I've got another date with Jane Austin before long. As Mark Twain said ""I wish I could dig her up and beat her with a pipe."" I'm feelin ya, Sam. "
"850",849,"Melat Bahta","loved it."
"852",851,"Marisela","It's not that I completely disliked this book. It was really interesting. I just thought the ending was a cop out. The story was tied up with a little bow.The truth is I didn't care for the main character, he was kinda boring, or maybe I was tired of how he did things through out the book. I did care about his sister and found her story much more compelling, especially when she was in danger."
"856",855,"Alex Tilley","It was very long and very punishing. I felt drawn into the darkness and misery, but there is much better russian literature in Tolstoy and Bulgakov. "
"857",856,"Kayathri Karuppasamy","I heard it is a famous and classic novel. So, I wanted to read it. But it is very lengthy and boring for me. Personally I don't find anything interesting in this novel. May be it is not for my liking."
"860",859,"Gary Allen","The 'Crime' taking English Lit in HS, the punishment having to read this book."
"862",861,"Andrew O'Rourke","A great look at the mind of a criminal. This being said, it went on too long, the subplots weren't good, and the ending was dreadful. I could barely finish it. This is one of the first ""classics"" that I felt was very overrated."
"864",863,"Chelsea Nicole","So many lessons in this book. Tell your AP English teacher you read this for ""fun"" over the summer, she will put you on a pedestal."
"867",866,"Bob Hartley","A good story, badly executed. The narrative is in keeping with the academic nature of the main character, but as we all know, true wisdom is in knowing what you don't know, so the English translation could have been less cumbersome, less formal."
"868",867,"Lucas Mahoney","Any high schooler can easily pump out a paper from this overly complex novel. However, those reading it will often times think it should be a crime to buy and a punishment to read."
"879",878,"Tesa Fiona","A must read Russian literature by Dostoyevsky. Brutally recommend by a Russian ex flatmate.. me not a crime novel fan but have a high expectation here.--------------------------------------------------Where should I start? Ah, yes, here: the rating I gave is solely based on the GR rating description where two stars means i's ok and that's all about it.""It's a work of genius."" of course I won't deny it. The content is marvelous. I am amazed by Mr. Dostoyevsky. This book has everything a great book needs, with powerful comments on philosophy, psychology, religion and culture. The fact that I am impressed by his expertise on such issues much more than the story plot and characters, makes me wonder: do I really care with what's going on here?I found myself several times in the exploration of Rodion's psychological states, I don't know how, I never even have a dream to see someone die, let alone to kill one. So, yes, Dostoyevsky is that good, you definitely have to read this book. But here the thing that didn't sound right to me: almost all the characters seemed to be too fragile.Like, everyone in this book are not on their healthy state of mind.. I am a sane human being and probably for that reason, I can't get into the characters' minds. For anyone's sake, how can all these people be altogether crazy?"
"886",885,"Kelv","At the start this book felt that Holden Caulfield had ripped off Rodion's character - sure it was in America and Holden didn't lead to murder, but it had the same crazy (psychopathic if you like) basket case personality. A personality which didn't really know what he wanted in his life. This book gave an insight into the mind before and after murder.I did like Rodion's mate Razumikhin who was true and consistent through out the book. Rodion's mother and sister were well rounded characters which added to the story."
"889",888,"Linda","I have read some amazing classics, this year, so I had no reason to think that Crime and Punishment wouldn’t be another winner. Unfortunately, I didn’t anticipate what a drag it would be. Hours and hours of my life dedicated to exploring the mind of an insane person. If only Dostoyevsky could have done it in 250 pages, it might have been tolerable. Sometimes it was oddly compelling, but, mostly, I just wanted the punishment to end. (view spoiler)[ As far as the plot goes, I never figured why Raskolnikov committed the murders. In the beginning, I assumed that it was about money, but, as the book went on, it was obviously that he didn’t care about the money. I suppose that he gave an explanation in his article, but the arguments, in the article, didn’t fit together with the circumstances of Raskolnikov life. His attempts to explain it to Sonya sounded ridiculous, except for the fact that he admitted that he was a little bad and a little crazy. In the end, the murders were senseless. I have to assume that that was the point, but it didn't sit well with me. (hide spoiler)]Sometimes if I don’t like a book, it is really that I just don’t understand the book. For a while, I read a chapter analysis after each chapter. I hoped that thoroughly understanding the book would help me appreciate it more. I gave that up by part three (about ½ through). The chapter analyses weren’t adding much to comprehension of the book, and it was prolonging the experience.I’m givingCrime and Punishment two stars instead of one, because Dostoyevsky, in some respects, is an excellent writer. I, truly, felt that I was inside the mind of a mad man.This book was a group read, and it satisfied the requirements of my classics challenge. The classics that I have read in 2015 are logged on bookreads and http://linda2015classicschallenge.blo..."
"892",891,"Ginny","This was book was well written, but I just didn't like the topic. The best advice I was given when reading this book was to keep an index card for the book mark and write down the characters names as you get to them and a small description. That was a huge help!"
"894",893,"Bethypage42","This is not a fun read. I read it on my own, and obviously missed the genius. It seemed more like a mystery than anything else. and frankly, it was boring. sorry. if any english teachers want to school me-feel free."
"897",896,"Ury949","Crime and Punishment was a bit disappointing because it was too slow and philosophical for my tastes. I thought I would like it because it's a classic and I tend to like classics. And I did like it up to the murder - which isn't too far into the book. Then everything gets really drawn out and for me it was tough to stay awake. Too much of Raskolnikov being ill and delirious, wandering the streets and fighting his inner demons and suspecting everyone of suspecting him. He acts paranoid at times, while other times he behaves quite randomly, following his heart and not his head. Everyone in the book is related somehow, so it's told as if Saint Petersburg was a small town where everybody knows everybody and there's only a limited number of suspects for the murder, which I found unrealistic. The women are pitiful, crying and fainting at every turn. By the last third of the book I began to wonder if people from the 1800's really acted like these characters, overblown with emotions and not thinking with logic. I can see why this book is valuable for having discussions on morality and human nature; perhaps that is why it was written in a way that seems so exaggerated and unreal. I wouldn't, however, recommend it for anyone looking for a truly good story."
"899",898,"Hazel","It may well be a classic but it was a struggle for me. I finished it as it was for my book group but did not see the point in it at all. Not worth the time and effort! "
"900",899,"J.R.","My low rating is not for Dostoyevsky's work but for the quality of the translation in the particular e-version of the book I've just read (the cover shown is not for the one I struggled through; couldn't find it).I had read Crime and Punishment long ago and just wanted a refresher. I shouldn't really complain too much about the version I found, since it was free and did satisfy my particular need for the moment. "
"902",901,"Amirhossain Khairandish","کلا هیچوقت نتوانستم کتاب های داستایوسکی را تمام کنم این بار عهد کردم این شاهکار ادبیات روسیه را تمامش کنم ...اصلا خوب نبود تعلیق و کشش کافی را ایجاد نمی کرد هرچند مکالمات فرعی گاهی جذاب و عمیق به نظر می رسید ولی هیچ جای گتاب با نویسنده و یا هیچیک از شخصیت ها نتوانستم هم دلیی داشته باشم اگر هم خواستید بخوانید ترجمه مهری آهی را نخوانید اصلا خوب نیست...."
"903",902,"Janay","Though the book started with much potential, 'Crime and Punishment' was a bit of a drag halfway though. I enjoyed the development of the main character in the first half of the book as well as the quick revelation of the conflict,but the climax in the first half gave way to drawn out philosophical musings in the second half of the book. Understandably, the main character is tormented by his actions and the suspicion and concerns of others. The writer,it seems, wants readers to experience similar torment as he presents internal ramblings, long and constant discussions of the conflict presented in the first half. The relationship between the protagonist and his love interest is also tormenting to imagine because of his response to her.There were moments where I lost interest in the book because the plot lacked incline after the first half. Fact is,we know the conflict and climax from the beginning so that all remains is the anxiety that is created while waiting for the inevitable to happen, which might just be what the writer intents. "
"909",908,"Maria","This was a dark, clumsy book that made me feel like I'd just downed a bottle of scotch while listening to a Tom Waits album. Yet it's a classic and I'm glad I got to read/teach it. Watch ""Match Point"" instead."

"921",920,"Megan Frank","I actually hated this book, but had to read it for high school English class. The only reason I gave it two stars (instead of one) is that it's well-written."
"922",921,"Heet Shah","A disappointing book according to me. I read it because it was one of the well known classics and must read book that everybody recommended. The plot is basically a murder that happens in the initial few pages in the hope of stealing something and the guilt that follows the murder for another few hundred pages until he confesses. The book is overall too melancholic and depressing till the end and it loses the interesting aspects of the plot due to this. "
"923",922,"Amy Skowronek","Dear god, I never thought I'd finish this book."
"924",923,"Brooke Nadzam","Okay, so I'm glad I read it, but I was not impressed. Maybe it was the translation (I read the free Kindle copy, so that's a serious possibility) but it was pretty slow in my opinion. Maybe someday I'll have to read it again since Matt gave it four stars and Mom gave it five stars (really, Mom? You though it was amazing?). "
"930",929,"Sarah Ludwig","It is very heavy, most of it is internal dialogue of a man who has the weight of a just commited murder on his mind. So, naturally, its slow as not much is physical happenings. I had to read it for school so i didnt have the leisure of reading slow. I didnt particularly 'enjoy' it but it is well written and i can see why it has survived time. "
"934",933,"Michael T Bradley","I think I'm finally going to give up on this sucker, simply because it's been so long since I last picked it up. Here's the thing. I LOVES me some Dostoevskey. But this one ... I don't know why, but this one just wasn't doing it for me. Translation? Reader? (It was an audio book) Not sure. It just felt like I had listened to HOURS of this book & mostly heard, 'Then he fretted some more.' I get that this is kind of Dostoevskey's wheelhouse, but MAN is there a lot of fretting in this book. I'm still curious to read the rest of the FD canon I haven't read, but I think I'm going to call this one a loss for now, sadly."
