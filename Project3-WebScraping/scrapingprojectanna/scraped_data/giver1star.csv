"1",0,"Samara Smith","It was an ok book. An easy read considering I finished it one day. I'm not sure if it was the fact that I had to read it for school, but it just wasn't my cup of tea."
"2",1,"Shameka","I honestly don't even know what to rate this book. It greatly disturbed me and what's even more upsetting is that this book is marketed towards children. In The Giver, the author creates a world that is seemingly perfect. The children are well behaved, people are kind to one another, families sit down at dinner together every night to discuss their ""feelings"", and everyone has a task/job that they perform that contributes to the overall growth and progress of society. But this world is also marred by atrocities such as population control (each family is only allowed two children), euthanasia, and the ""release"" of the weak and troublesome. The people cannot choose anything for themselves including their spouse, their profession, or even their own children's names. At first I thought the author was setting it up to ultimately reveal that these viewpoints are wrong and that controlling every aspect of a person's life from the time they are born until they are ""released"" is not only unnatural but also immoral. But in my opinion that never really happened. I mean there are parts of the book where young Jonas and The Giver weigh some of these atrocities and come to the conclusion that they may be necessary. For example in one conversation Jonas decides that population control is not completely bad because it prevents food shortage which in turn prevents anyone from ever having to endure the pain of being hungry. Really...I guess one can reach the conclusion that the author did ultimately convey that living in this world is undesirable by (view spoiler)[having The Giver plot Jonas' escape (hide spoiler)] but man do you have to dig deep to come to that conclusion. It seemed to me that the book was more focused on how much these people were missing out on by not having memories and choice rather than on the complete immorality of having a world even remotely resembling the one created in this book.After reading this book I want to know what was your point Ms. Lowry. I mean what exactly did you want me to walk away from this book with. Because quite frankly all I was left feeling was disgust and confusion.And I don't know why some people claim that this is a Christian themed book. It is not!"

"4",3,"Mathias","Dear Reader,If you have not read this book let me tell you a litle bit about it. This book is very good but the subject is not the best. This book has a community were they do everything. The main character is Jonas a boy who in the book at the end is 12 years old. He is very matture like all the othter boys his age. In this book theyre are many characters and also the community took all the feelings away from them. They do not feel anything. In this book the climax is that Jonas runs away and they are looking for him. He runs away and takes a baby named Gabriel goes with him. Jonas takes care of him and he is a very good big brother to him. At the end of the book he sees a house in wich they are playing music and then the book stops. Sicerely,MathiasP.S Check out my rating you may see what I really think."

"6",5,"Brenna McGovern","This book was awful. My 7th grade English class had read this book in early 2011. I did not enjoy it. The characters in the book are living as robots and it was confusing and hard to relate at all to this book or its characters.The Giver is a children's novel by Lois Lowry. It is set in a society which is at first presented as a utopian society and gradually appears more and more dystopian. The novel follows a boy named Jonas through the twelfth year of his life. The society has eliminated pain and strife by converting to ""Sameness,"" a plan that has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives. Jonas is selected to inherit the position of ""Receiver of Memory,"" the person who stores all the past memories of the time before Sameness, in case they are ever needed to aid in decisions that others lack the experience to make. When Jonas meets the previous receiver—The ""Giver""—he is confused in many ways. Additionally, the Giver is able to break some rules, such as turning off the speaker that listens to peoples' conversations in their homes, and lying to people of the community. As Jonas receives the memories from the Giver, he discovers the power of knowledge. The people in his community are happy because they do not know of a better life, and the knowledge of what they are missing out on could create major chaos. He faces a dilemma: Should he stay with the community and the safe, consistent but shallow life it offers, or should he run away in pursuit of a life full of love, color, choices, and knowledge, but also potentially full of danger?"

"10",9,"♥ Kaneshaa  Gorgeouss ♥","The Giver was about a boy named Jonas living in a community that was different from the usual community people live in now a days. Their community was known to be a "" Utopia "" which means perfect world. They were pretty much like robots. They did the samething everyday. The community was controlled by people called Elders who made the decision. Jonas was just turning 12 and the tradition of the community was that when you reached the age of 12 you were considered adults. They had to do adult things like get a job and be responsible for the own selfs. I did not like this book, it was really boring to me and very confusing."

"12",11,"Kathy Kayser-konig","I hated this book. (And that's saying something.)"
"13",12,"colleen","This book so far is really strange. It's rules and rituals are really different than our society. But I hope later in this book, it has a twist so that it seems more interesting."
"15",14,"Guy","I read this book because it came highly recommended from a friend who is a teacher in an elementary school. We had been discussing YA books. She, for obvious reasons, and I because I'd taken the optional 'Children's Literature' course in the Education Department of SFU and found reading YA books as an adult to be fascinating. Thus arose the high recommendation.I was very disappointed. I'll rephrase. I was 
VERY
 disappointed, even shocked. The shock was because the book starts off well — not brilliantly, but solidly. Within the utopian community Lowry carefully, slowly builds an awareness in the reader that there are evils behind the literally 'black and white' world lived by the residents who had been 'blessed' by science's ability to keep passion and all other irrationalities from displacing reasonableness. And, while this part was done well, the ending was horrible. Let me rephrase. The ending was dreck. I won't give away the details of its being dreck, but do not read further if you want to read this book and have the ending be a complete surprise. The ending is perhaps the absolute worst ending of any book of any genre of any age I have ever read. It stands out because, while I have read far worse books, I have not read any books written as competently for its bulk, to be blindsided by such Christian banality. The ending moved this book from a 3 star read to less than 1. If I had to choose between reading this book again and throwing sand in my eyes, gritty eyes here I come!Finally, I hope that my extreme castigation of The Giver won't inspire you to test my reaction. However! This book may well appeal to a peculiar kind of Christian who sees saccharine sweet, unbelievable deus ex machina endings covered in corn syrup as powerful examples of God's wonder. I found the ending of this book to be an epitome of an infantile maudlin human sentimentality that was able to provoke my gag reflex. "

"24",23,"Cameron Craig","Louis Lowry's ""The giver,"" is a book about a futuristic society, that is presented like a utopian society. In this society there is no war, poverty, and starvation; but there is also no color, love, and that one little thing that makes us human: a brain for reasoning and questioning. Not to mention, In this society, when people break the law, get to a certain age, and or is really sick, they ""release them""; and by ""release them"", they mean they put them in a room and gas them. The book is about a young boy named: Jonas, and on his 12th birthday, he is assigned to become the new receiver of memories'. He meets an old man simply known as ""The giver"", who somehow is able to psychically transmit memories of other people thousands of years before this society was established, into Jonas mind.You know what would be better than the power to transmit memories into people, how about the power to use you'r brain, you schmuck's!Now that I think about it, why does this futuristic society even need ""The giver""? What's the point? Whats his purpose? I really hate this book because it never explains anything about the society's history or backgrounds. Its like the author of the book just wanted us to hate them, just because they're the generic evil empire. Also, how come every so-called ""perfect society"" in the future ruled by nazi's in science fiction stories? Wouldn't it make more sense just to put some extra background story into the evil society instead of just giving us pointless memories of pain?I also heard that they are making a movie based off this book. I hope it never comes to be, because this story is just stupid. To make things even worse, this is supposed to be a book for young adults, yet when I had read it in 9th grade, it made absolutely no sense what so ever because they make things in the story so overly complex that it just makes you want to hurt someone. How come this society has been in power for thousands upon thousands of years, and yet nobody has tried to go against it or be part of a rebellion? It just makes no sense!I really don't recommend this book to anyone. Its stupid, and's it's just so many plot holes at every turn. This is a book that just insults everyones intelligence about reality. It would had been a lot better if the author took time to explain the history of the society, how it came to pass, why other nations fell to it, and why no one has tried resisting it ever since. I don't care if people say it's a classic, or if it's symbolic; It's just stupid beyond comprehension. Avoid this book like the plague!"

"33",32,"Brittania09","Lowry’s hero chooses rebellion in the absence of oppression. He does not struggle against a society that demeans, undermines, or persecutes its members. In fact, no one but Jonas and the Giver know that life could be anything other than perfect. But like Eve enticed by the serpent’s promise of greater knowledge, Jonas feels compelled to bring the knowledge of good and evil to his ignorant society. Is this rebellious conspiracy-theorist to be the hero for a generation of young people? If we are to idolize a rebel, perhaps we should choose one who fights a worthy cause against a genuine threat. Not one who brashly seeks to defy authority and destroy peace out of passionate bitterness. Although critically evaluating one’s society is a worthy undertaking, giving children the green light to question authority is unwise.Read the whole review at http://wordsonwordsreviews.blogspot.c..."

"36",35,"Jon Norimann","""The Giver"" is s useless but luckily short book about an alternative, simpler human society. Granted this book should never have been on my reading list as its for kids/teenagers. However judged on its objective merits the story is emotionally based and with no foundation. It all boils down to appealing to the readers gut feeling of how great our normal human world is compared to the world loosely described in the book. The storyline is so thin it hardly qualifies as a story at all and the end is hardly an end.Reading ""The Giver"" is not worth anyones time, despite the book being very short and an easy read."
"37",36,"Darryl","Terrible. What a used story-line. Unoriginal. It deserves sarcasm: ""Hey let's write a dystopian novel for kids. We'll throw in some critical acclaim so they'll read it, but we won't construct a plot or develop characters. We'll just say things that the reader should feel and hope it strikes a chord."" Mediocre. I've lost all confidence in the Newberry Award."
"38",37,"Laurie","This book had an interesting premise, but the ending was very open ended. You don't really know for sure what happened to the characters. I know there are a lot of people who like this type of thing, but I'm not one of them. I like me endings all wrapped up in a nice neat package. Some of the aspects of the story are very disturbing (as they are meant to be). I probably would have given it another star if the ending had been better."

"41",40,"J.G. Keely","Lowry's book is a piece of nationalist propaganda, using oversimplification, emotional appeals, and dualistic morality to shut down her readers' minds. More troubling is that it is aimed at children, who don't yet have the critical faculties to defend themselves from such underhanded methods.Unsurprisingly, Lowry adopts the structure of the monomyth, equating a spiritual journey with a moral one. Her Christ-figure uses literal magic powers to rebel against his society. This rebellion and the morality behind it are presented as 'natural', to contrast with the 'abnormal morality' around him.Lowry doesn't seem to understand that we get our morality from our culture, it isn't something in-born that we 'lose'. This is the first hint of Lowry's misunderstanding of the human mind. She assumes her own morality is correct, and then builds her story to fit it.She also makes the character act and think like we do, despite never adequately explaining how he came up with such unusual notions. It's the same trick many historical fiction authors use, leaving us scratching our heads as to why a Fourteenth Century French peasant speaks like a second-wave feminist. I'd suggest that Lowry falls to this fault for the same reason they do: she has no talent for imagining how others might think differently.Lowry's book ends with the standard nonspecific transgressive spiritual event that marks all monomyths. Since the book is not a progressive presentation of ideas, it does not suggest any conclusion. Instead, the climax is a symbolic faux-death event (symbolic of what, none can say). Confusingly, Lowry later redacts the ending in the sequels, undermining the pseudo-spiritual journey she created.Though some call this book 'Dystopian', it's closer to the truth to say Lowry borrows elements from the Dystopian authors, attempting to combine the spiritual uplift of the monomyth with the political and social deconstruction of the Dystopia. What she doesn't recognize is that the faith of the one conflicts with the cynicism of the other. She draws on ideas and images from many other authors: Bradbury, Huxley, Orwell, Burgess, but doesn't improve upon them.These authors created novels that reflected the world around them. They based them on the political events of the times, presented with realism and careful psychology. Though they presented the struggle between the individual and the society, they portrayed morality as grey, and suffering as the result of individual human faults, not political systems. Lowry doesn't realize that the best way to critique Fascism or Communism is not to present it as 'evil', but to simply present it as it was.But Lowry's world is not based in reality, it is symbolic and hyperbolic. Instead of writing about how poverty makes the world seem small and dull, she has the characters magically unable to experience life. Instead of an impersonal government, she presents a sort of evil hippy commune. The only political system it resembles is a school, which is a neat little trick to get the kids interested. The idea that 'school=unfeeling totalitarian hell' is not an uncommon one, but it's one I'm surprised teachers would support. The book also suggests a creche, but lacking similarity to any real-world system, it doesn't work as a political criticism.Lowry creates this artificial world to suit her purposes, but it is not a symbolic exercise like 'Animal Farm'. We understand that the pigs of animal farm are symbolic, because there are no talking pigs. Lowry's world is more insidious, since its oversimplification is hidden. She builds an artificial world to support the dualist morality that she's pushing. She presents the same knee-jerk fears about euthanasia and abortion that people use against Women's Rights or Health Care.Worse than these Straw Man arguments is the fact that she never deals with the economic causes of totalitarianism. Tyrants don't just rise up and take control by their own force of will, they come into power because of the socioeconomic situations that surround them. Lean times produce strong, fascist leaders while profitable times produce permissive, liberal societies.Strong, centralized leadership simply doesn't self-propagate in cultures where everyone is clothed, fed, and housed. The Holocaust was socially about some ideal of 'change' and 'purity', but it was economically about the transmission of wealth from Jews, Poles, and Catholics to Germans (and more specifically, to those Germans who had elected the new ruling party).The atrocities of war are, for the most, part committed by normal people to other normal people. By presenting the power structure as 'amoral' and 'inhuman', Lowry ignores the fact that people will willingly cause others to suffer. Painting the enemy as 'evil' and 'alien' is just an unsophisticated propagandist method.She contrasts her 'evil' with the idealized 'goodness' of emotion, beauty, and freedom. This is nothing more than the American dream of 'specialness' that Mr. Rogers was pushing for so many years. We are all special, we are all good, we all deserve love and happiness. Sure, it sounds good, but what does it mean?Where does this 'specialness' come from? If it is just the 'sanctity of human life', then it's not really special, because it's all-encompassing. If all of us are special, then none of us are. There's nothing wrong with valuing life, but when Lowry presents one mode of life as valuable and another as reprehensible, she ceases to actually value humanity as a whole. Instead, she values a small, idealized chunk of humanity. 'People are good, except the ones I don't like' is not a moral basis, nor is it a good message to send to kids.If the specialness is only based on fitting in with a certain moral and social guideline, then Lowry isn't praising individuality, she's praising herd behavior. The protagonist is only 'special' because he has magic powers. His specialness is not a part of his character, it is an emotional appeal.The idea of being a special individual is another piece of propaganda, and its one kids are especially prone to, because kids aren't special: they are carefully controlled and powerless. Giving a character special powers and abilities and then using that character to feed a party line to children is not merely disingenuous, it's disturbing.There is also a darker side to universal specialness: giving a child a sense of importance without anything to back it up creates egotism and instability. Adults noticed that children with skills and friends had high self-esteems, but instead of teaching their children social skills and knowledge, they misunderstood the causal relationship and tried to give them self-worth first.Unfortunately, the moment unsupported self-worth is challenged, the child finds they have nothing to fall back on. Their entitlement didn't come from their skills or experiences, and so they have nothing to bolster that sense of worth. Instead, any doubt sends them down a spiral of emotional instability.A single book like this wouldn't be the cause of such a state in a child, but it does act as part of the social structure built to give a sense of worth without a solid base for that worth. People like to believe they are special, kids especially so, but being a remarkable person is not a result of belief but of actions. If the book had informed them, then it would leave them better off, but giving them a conclusion based on emotional appeals does nothing to build confidence or character.Many people have told me this book is good because it appeals to children, but children often fall for propaganda. Children develop deep relationships with pop stars, breakfast cereals, and Japanese monsters. This does not make them good role models for children.Feeding 'specialness' to kids along with a political message is no better than the fascist youth programs Lowry intends to criticize. The obsession with individuality is just another form of elitism. It's ironic that people in America most often describe themselves as individuals when pointing out the things they do to align themselves with groups.But banding together in a community is not a bad thing. For Lowry and other 'Red Scare' children, any mention of 'communal' can turn into a witch hunt, but we all give up some personal rights and some individuality in order to live in relatively safe, structured societies. There are benefits to governmental social controls and there are drawbacks, and it's up to us to walk the line between the two. Anarchy and Totalitarianism never actually exist for long: we are social animals.It's not difficult to understand why Lowry is so popular, especially amongst educators. The message she gives aligns perfectly with what they were taught as kids, from Red Scare reactionism to the hippy-dippy 'unique snowflake' mantra. These ideas aren't entirely misguided, either. It's good to recognize the benefits of difference and the dangers of allowing other to control our lives.If a reader believes that fascism and socialism are inherently wrong and that their own individuality is their greatest asset, they will likely sympathize with Lowry's work. However, this doesn't make the book honest, nor beneficial. One of the hardest things we can do as readers is disagree with the methods of authors we agree with ideologically.It makes us feel good to find authors who agree with us, but this is when we should be at our most skeptical. Searching the world for self-justification is not a worthwhile goal, it simply turns you into another short-sighted, argumentative know-it-all. 'Yes men' never progress.Lowry is toeing the party line. She does not base her book around difficult questions, like the Dystopian authors, but around easy answers. She doesn't force the reader to decide for themselves what is best, she makes it clear what she wants us to think. Her book is didactic, which means that it instructs the reader what to believe.Even if her conclusions about Individuality vs. Community are correct, she doesn't present arguments, she only presents conclusions. Like rote memorization or indoctrination, she teaches nothing about the politics, social order, economics, or psychology of totalitarianism or individuality. The reader is not left with an understanding, just an opinion.The baseless 'individuality' of the book lets the reader imagine that they are rebels--that they are bucking the system even as they fall into lock-step. By letting the reader think they are already free-thinking, Lowry tricks them into forgetting their skepticism.She is happy to paint a simple world of black and white, and this is likely the world she sees. I doubt she is purposefully creating an insidious text, she just can't see past her own opinions. She writes this book with a point to make, and makes it using emotional appeals and symbolism. She doesn't back it up with arguments because she doesn't seem to have developed her opinions from cogent arguments.In the end, she doesn't show us that the structure of this society is wrong, she says nothing poignant about individuality vs. community; instead, she relies on threats to the life of an innocent infant. Yet nowhere does she provide an argument for why communal living or the sacrifice of freedoms for safety must necessarily lead to infanticide.In politics, making extreme claims about the opposing side is called mud-slinging, it is an underhanded and dishonest tactic. It works. Arguing intelligently is difficult, accusing is easy, so that's what Lowry does.She is another child of WWII and the Cold War who hasn't learned her lesson. She quickly condemns the flaws of others while failing to search out her own. Even after the Holocaust, there are many racist, nationalist, violent Jews; conflict rarely breeds a new understanding.America condemned the faceless communal life of the Second World, and yet America created The Projects. We critiqued strong governmental controls, but we still have the bank bailout, socialized medicine, socialized schooling, and socialized charity. America condemned the Gulags and Work Camps, and yet we imprison one out of every hundred citizens; far more than Stalin ever did. Some are killed, all are dehumanized.As a little sci fi adventure, the book isn't terrible. It's really the pretension that goes along with it. Lowry cobbles together religious symbolism and Dystopic tropes and then tries to present it as something as complex and thoughtful as the authors she copied. Copying isn't a crime, but copying poorly is.Like Dan Brown or Michael Crichton, she creates a political pamphlet of her own ideals, slaps a pretense of authority on it, and then waits for the money and awards to roll in--and they did. Many people I've discussed this book with have pointed to those awards as the surest sign of this book's eminent worth.Award committees are bureaucratic organizations. Their decisions are based on political machinations. This book is a little piece of Nationalism, and so it was lauded by the political machine that Lowry supports. The left hand helps the right. If awards are the surest sign of worth, then Titanic is a better movie than Citizen Kane.What surprises me is how many of those who brought up the award as their argument were teachers. If a politically-charged administrative committee is the best way to teach children, then why do you take umbrage when the principal tells you that bigger class sizes (and fewer benefits) are fine? Listen to him: doesn't he have award plaques?The other argument is usually that 'kids like it'. I usually respond that kids also like candy, so why not teach that? Some people also get angry at me for analyzing a book written for children:""Of course it's not a great book, it's for kids! If you want a good book, go read Ulysses!""I prefer to give children good books rather than pieces of political propaganda (even if they agreed with me). Children can be as skeptical, quick-witted, and thoughtful as adults if you give them the chance, so I see no excuse for feeding them anything less. Kids aren't stupid, they just lack knowledge, and that's a fine distinction. It's easy for adults to take advantage of their naivete, their emotionality, and their sense of worth. Just because it's easier for the teacher doesn't mean it's better for the child.When we show children something that is over-simplified, presenting an idealized, crudely moralizing world, we aren't preparing them for the actual world. If you give a child a meaningless answer to repeat, he will repeat it, but he won't understand why. Why not give the child a book that presents many complex ideas, but no rote answers, and let them make up their own minds? If they don't learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff and form their own opinions early, in a safe, nurturing environment, what chance will they have on their own as adults?In all the discussions and research regarding this book, I have come across very little analysis. It's especially surprising for a book with such a strong following, but there aren't many explanations of why the book is supposed to be useful or important.This lack of argument makes sense from a political standpoint, since there is no reason to analyze the worth of propaganda: its worth is that it agrees with society and indoctrinates readers. Analyzing it would defeat the purpose; political diatribes do not stand up to thoughtful attention.Perhaps someday someone will create a thoughtful, textual analysis of this book that will point out its merits, its structure and its complexity. I've gradually come to doubt it. I never expected when I wrote my original review of this book that it would garner this much attention.I still welcome comments and thoughts, but if your comment looks roughly like this: ""You should read this book again, but this time, like it more. You think you're smart but you aren't. You're mean. Lowry is great. This book won awards and kids like it. It's meant for kids anyways, why would you analyze what its about? I bet you never even read the sequels. Go read 'Moby Dick' because you are full of yourself.""I've heard that one before. If you do want to comment though, you might check out this article; I find it helps me with presenting my ideas."

Also, the ending was completely anticlimactic and gives the reader no closure on the story. It's not even the kind of ending that makes you wonder or think.

I hated the book, it was really boring and un realistic. I thought the plot of the book was stupid. I really didn't liked this book and i wouldn't recommend this book. the reason I didn't like the book was because it is suppost to be in the future and their version of the future was stupid. the book was really boring because the plot was really slow.

Strašno neprijetna knjiga. In netekoč jezik. In nič dobrega ne vidim v njej, no. Blah."
"53",52,"Justin Friesen","The giver is a book based on the idea of a utopian society, where everyone is told what to do and does it the same way. Personally I was not a huge fan of the book because there was no freedom in it, the people each do the same thing like when they each get a bike at the age of 9. Then suddenly jonas's life changed when he was selected to be the receiver of the town, a very rare job with vigorous training and the job to store the memories of the past in his head. But a problem arises as a little boy named Gabriel (problem child) can not sleep at the nursery and after jonas builds a relationship with him they say they are gonna release him which actually means to kill him. To find out what Jonas is going to do you will have to read the book."

"69",68,"Sylvia","Re-read for third time. (9/2014) Love the introduction written in the latest book by the author. This is a dystopia book and not a feel good book. When I read it with that in mind, it serves it's purpose. Just not my favorite kind of book to read. I understand that being able to choose is what makes life beautiful. That means taking in the good with the bad, the ugly with the beautiful."

In an interesting way. i wonder how does the get such an imagination. The way they say at the beginning frightened no an awful feeling about to happen. Well the point is its is its a very interesting book. "

"76",75,"Bernard Adri","The giver made me mad, sad, and was a little confusing. This book made me angry because it was unrealistic that a person can hold the memories of a generation and the people wouldn't remember the past. It was sad that people in charge were able to decide who lived and who died. The book was confusing because the author jumps from present time to the past and I had a hard time following which was which."

He learns all of the dirty secrets his town is keeping, he knows he needs to stop them from doing these sick, revolting things. Will he succeed? This book may have been interesting at some parts, but over all I didn't enjoy reading it. How could I enjoy a book where babies are killed?!?! I only read this because everyone had to read it in class. This book scares me... "

"89",88,"Nativeabuse","Had to read this when I was in 7th grade and I didn't like it then. I still can't remember it well enough to put my finger on exactly why I didn't like it, but I remember really hating this much more than anything else I'd read up to that point.The other reviews do more justice to this book than I can so I will just say that this book should not be forced onto little kids when there are much better dystopian books to choose from! I feel like this book is just a lame copy of the others that really comes off as a badly crafted knock off product. It lacks the feeling that other dystopians have and really creates an air of apathy. Another main problem is that I simply cannot relate to the main character or the old man, or anyone. Which really annoyed me. I think it says a lot about how weird the author is if she can relate to this main character, or believes that other people will. Shes definitely off her rocker."

"92",91,"Paul Gibson","Spoiler alert:There is more than one way to read a story; more than one level of interpretation, implied and/or inferred. There are different aspects of a story one can stress.One might point to a story where the ""Father"" gives over his ""son"" to shoulder the sins of the world in order to save us so that we may live. Sounds like serious stuff until the story ends with the ""son"" arriving in the world on Christmas morning, riding a red sleigh like Santa Claus.I had to giggle. It is a children's book after all. But offense may be taken when God is viewed like Santa. I suppose I could also be offended and take this story as seriously as many people do but just because the author values pride and individual choice above fairness, politeness, no war or hunger. . . well, that's up to her. But the fact that she feels the need to set up a society with faults that don't follow from any reason is troubling. One could suggest that pride and individualism (and the like) are right-wing values while being fair and polite (and the like) are left-wing values but few parents teach their children to be rude and unfair; values such as these are best left to dubious ideologies, as if larger society shouldn't be valued as highly as family. When all is said and done, there is not enough depth of religious or philosophical ideas for me to take it seriously . . . only a straw-man society that has flaws that are as unlikely as its strengths.But wait, there's more . . . One main rule for the main character is that he must not discuss with anybody including parents and elders, what goes on behind closed doors with the old man who is his trainer. What might go on in this room? Here's what we do know:""Move to the bed, and lie face down. Remove your tunic first"" . . . ""What are you going to do sir?"" . . . . He placed his hands on Jonas's bare back.Now, I was warned that there were some surprises, some of them disturbing, but this situation and language seems to pass right by people. Something shocking happens here: Children reading this might assume (as is all too common) that this sort of situation is acceptable. Children should not accept such an agreement and should be sure to tell parents and/or elders about it."

"97",96,"Kristopher","Hogwash. It's the first word which comes to mind when I read this. There is way too many open ended items and things which simply, do not make sense. Warfare - the society has no concept of warfare but the children play war and shoot fake guns. Sunshine - how in the world is sunshine removed from the community? Where would they get food? This would only be possible if it was some Truman show scenario.Ending - everyone is torn on what happened. Did he make it? Did he die? Here is what happened, the Giver is a liar. He lies. He manipulates Jonas into leaving so he isn't released and can hold onto power. The end. Simply put, the more vague and open ended a book is, does not make it a good book. A book should provide more closure on items than leaving readers speculating."

"111",110,"Anourag"," I am currently reading “The Giver.” The author of this book is Lois Lawry. The genre of this book is young adult, classics, Sci-fi, fiction, and fantasy.	The Giver is about a boy named Jones who is assigned to the biggest role in the community the receiver if memory. After he is chosen he has to take classes on what to do by the Giver. He has to learn about memories such as colors such as red, blue, green, and has to learn about sunlight and grandparents. And there is also excruciating memories such as war, broken legs and bodies, depression and others. 	 I would recommend this book to people who liked role of thunder and the Egypt game. This book in the beginning is a little boring and weird/awkward, so I would also recommend this book to people who like suspense."

"113",112,"Nour El-dein","Cheap, and Obviously made in only a Couple Days. The Author spoils any chance of a Really Developed Moment by Squashing it in With some completely Boring Subject or action of the Character's Life, most of it not even relating to a Future event in the Book. Full of Cliche and Predictable Melodrama, not Only that but the Author can't even give us a Vague Representation of Color. ""He couldn't name it, Just seemed Different, It was there. Different. So Noticeable. It was a Weird change that Only Jonas Saw"". Are you Kidding me? My General statement for the Book: I do not Recommend this at All to Any Decent Reader of Any Sort. All I can Suggest is that if the Author wishes to Continue with a Type of Series, She can Improve her Descriptions and Visualizations, Character Development was Terrible, the Only Main Character to Actually change was a Bland 12-Year Old with no sense of direction or Dignity, Halfway to the Book is not the General Point where a Book is supposed to Introduce the Climax. And Guess what Fellow Readers, not even the ending gives us a Satisfying Answer or conclusion to our ""High Hopes"". And I thought J.K. Rowling was the Worst Author to Exist..."

"121",120,"Robert","I am not a big fan of science- fiction fantasy genre and therefore did not enjoy this book.

"132",131,"Caitlyn","The Giver by Lois Lowry is a boring book. The book takes place in December. It is about a boy named Jonas who doesn’t like the rules at first in Sameness where he lives. So, he decides to do something about it. The book sometime in the future. One thing I liked about this book is that it was unique. For example, the setting was an original Utopian city. There is nothing like it. The reason there isn’t is because it’s supposed to be perfect. This was the only thing that I liked about the book. One thing I disliked about this book is that there was no real ending. For example, it didn’t tell us what happened to Jonas and Gabe. It can also get confusing throughout the book. At many points in the book you wouldn’t be sure what was going on. For example, one page you would be in snow and sledding, then the next you would be in a weird office.  Overall, I really disliked this book because it was not interesting and had no ending. It had a good unique idea. Although, it was not executed and written correctly. It also can be disturbing for people who don’t like to think about a baby getting a needle through his head. I would not recommend this book. "
"133",132,"Bianca","I'm probably the only person in the world that hated this book. Awful, awful, awful. Come on, the Giver has to ""touch"" Jonah to give hime memories, and with his shirt off. Jonah enjoys bathing old people, and is way too attached to that baby. No."

I love futuristic/other world books, and she freaking ruined it for me! oh my goodness!Jonas was a powerless little cunt and also a brainless retard. Their world was black and white and everything was regulated.And there was completely no action. No action at all! Who the hell writes a book with no action.Oh wait, Jonas once took an apple without permission. How exciting! This was a waste of my time, and I am happy that my teacher-given copy of this book is currently in ash form. It, fortunately, suffered a fire and nobody was there to save it. :) How sad. We shall miss it(not)."

I yawned nearly EVERY 5 SECONDS, and no, I am not exaggerating when I say this. I literally yawned that much. I am usually not tired during LA class, I was jubilant even. I was slightly tired, but it was in a modicum, rather than a significant amount. Anyway, I barely listened to the story (and even slept a bit once, but oh well!). After we read the novel, we had a test with 45 questions about the novel and 20 vocabulary questions that were rather easy. I missed 4 questions of the 45 questions and none of the vocabulary, which resulted in an A-. In my opinion, the novel was THAT boring, and THAT easy. My apologies, Lois Lowry, but you didn't live up to my expectations. The novel just was not my cup of tea."

"171",170,"Sharon","It feels wrong giving a 1-star rating to a book so many others love, but, this is my opinion, and I found this book to be a boring, total waste of time. A much better, more through-provoking book on the same theme that I can recommend, is Brave New World. It seems The Giver is a rip off of BNW only it's worse because it has no ending. The entire reason I kept reading it was to find out what new item it brought to this scene that's been written about time and time again already. As it turns out, it brings nothing new at all. Read Brave New World instead."

"176",175,"Lasairfiona Smith","I was talking to my brother about books we were forced to read in school and I was remind of this book. First I read it on my own and then for a class in 8th grade.I hated it both times. I had already read some of the classic sci-fi (1984, etc) and the ideas in this book are directly ripped from those classics. When I read it, it seemed that Lowry wasn't just taking classic sci-fi ideas and retelling them. Rather, she took the ideas whole and stuck them in her story that becomes boring with all of that old material rehashed.It angers me that this book is for kids. Again and again, I try and tell people that you should give kids challenging books as they will step up and enjoy them. This book is watered down with no new ideas nor new writing techniques. Give kids something to chew on, not this mush. If you want to introduce these ideas to them, give them the originals or at least something that isn't a rip off. If one insists that this book can be read by kids, try handing it to them in 3rd grade or earlier. 8th grade, when I was required to read it, is so completely late that it is a crime."
"177",176,"Stephany","this book was amazingly terrible. talk about utopian society! i can't believe people would actually even consider living like that"
"178",177,"1pace_emma"," I did not like this book. I found it very odd and a little confusing. The beginning I found very interesting and cool but the middle and end I found weird and I had trouble getting through the rest of it. "
"179",178,"Sara","one word: horrible!"
"180",179,"Sijmen","The set up is nice enough, but the story picks up very slowly and feels rushed towards the end. There is little internal logic to the book, with aspects of the memory transfer concept conveniently invented whenever needed (deus ex machina)."
"181",180,"Alaina Torres","I didn’t enjoy The Giver by Lois Lowry at all. It was boring to me and never interested me. It was difficult for me to read and just remember what I actually read. The setting takes place in a small community where each person, when they reach the age of twelve, are assigned to a job. Jonas, the main character, is assigned to be a receiver for the giver and wants to change things for his community and to make it a better one. I would recommend this book to young readers who enjoy action and science fiction. It reminds me of the book Divergent or The Hunger Games. The Giver takes place in more of a futuristic setting, so if you enjoy those types of book then you’ll like The Giver."

"187",186,"Vanessa (V.C.)","I remember being forced to read this in middle school and hated it; it basically went over my head. Reading it now as an adult, I still can't really understand why this novel is so popular and why this is required reading for young adults. Here are my main gripes: 1) There is no sense of time or place. Okay, it obviously takes place in a utopian society that is also very much dystopian in its theme and the way society is played out in the novel, but that's about all that we can gather. Otherwise, where exactly does this story takes place? What is this society called? It seemed as if there was virtually no effort put to really establish a time and place, which made reading this novel very confusing. 2) The characters are so bland, one-dimensional, and uninteresting. Why should I care about these characters? The author didn't give me one reason to really care about any of them. Even their dialogue was very dull and dry. Because the characters were so bland, it also made the story very bland as well. Where was the character development? There was none that I found. 3) It's so obviously preachy and its themes are so forced and transparent. I know its a novel aimed at young adults and all but did it really have to be so obvious? 4) The climax felt very rushed to me. The most moving scene of the novel was the euthanizing (""the release"") scene of the twin and the main character's horror of seeing what his dad does for a living, but then from there out of nowhere The Giver and the main character decide to ""escape"" without really much explanation of how they came to that conclusion other than ""Things gotta change.""5) The ending. I can't stand endings that don't actually have a concrete ending. I get it's a way to challenge the reader to make up for themselves what happened, but i dunno, i find this tactic very lazy and unfinished. I dunno if it's just me, but The Giver as a whole just feels unfinished to me. With no character development, no sense of time and place, broad and obvious themes that don't surprise or challenge the reader, and an ending that did a cop-out ""You figure out what happened!"" thing, it just left me feeling as if I was wasting my time reading this novel then during middle school and especially now.

"190",189,"Meghan W","This book made me go through a 3 year phase where I was 100% absolutely certain I would NEVER have children simply so my later generations wouldn't have to live a life described in this book. In other words, it deeply impacted me, just not in the positive way. I'm not a fan of sci-fi and especially dis-Utopian society books. It made my little 7th grade heart fear the world and the future. I don't think I'd ever read it again, because I am certain my opinion would not change."

But why, with all the stuff happening to the main character, isn't it thrilling in any kind of way? Why didn't I feel anything while reading it? To be honest, for me this was like Divergent without the suspense and the fun.This is even one of the books where I have to say that the film is so much better....I just don't get the Giver's popularity and the high rating."

"201",200,"Jace","Other than a basic plot outline, all I remember out this book is that I HATED it when I read it in fifth grade. I was quite disappointed, because based on the subject matter I had really expected to like it. Maybe I should give it another try one of these days. "

I hope Xochi skips right over this one when she grows up."
"203",202,"Ivy Seaward","It was ok. "
"205",204,"Alex Rangel","worst book ever"
"206",205,"Natalie","There should be a warning that comes along with this book: IF YOU DON'T LIKE READING ABOUT BABIES GETTING SHOTS IN THEIR FOREHEADS TO KILL THEM, DO NOT READ FURTHER.This is a common sixth grade novel. After all, Lowry is a well-known author, and it won the Newbery. I am a big reader, and this is THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ.The first mistake is it takes place in the apocolypse. Okay. Some of the best books in the world take place in the apocolypse (ahem, The Hunger Games, which is actually real literature). But it starts off in a strange, gray world, where there is a tyrant commanding you take ""safe"" medication (""vitamins"") to suppress puberty. Characters are hardly developed- the only real feeling Jonas expresses is his love for Fiona, and perhaps a bit of rebellion when he stops taking his ""vitamins"". The Giver it seems is a magic old man, who tells him cryptic secrets and finally reveals that the place they live in is less than Utopia, than the ""perfect"" world described on the back cover. Finally we sense the climax coming to a point, when the baby's life is threatened by Jonas' kind father, who is ready to disgustingly kill the baby. How they consider this appropriate literature, something middle-schoolers should follow in the footsteps of. Finally, even fans of this grotesque fiction must admit the ending is less than satisfying. Jonas has successfully rescued Gabe from his lethal ""shot"".The book ends where Jonas falls in the snow with Gabe in his arms- he sees blinking lights, maybe someone will come to rescue him and take him in, maybe he has frostbite, is hallucinating, and both will die shortly after. Some say this is a ""cliffhanger ending""; I say that Lois Lowry cannot write."
"207",206,"Erik V.","I think that the giver had a good plot, but needs a little work helping the reader stay with the story. During the book I sometimes found myself confused on why things were happening or what was going on. I think that Lois Lowry also could have describe the setting more through Jonas’ eyes. It was a very bland book and the ending should have been more significant. Other than that this story would have been a very interesting book."

"219",218,"Carlos","it was boring but my teacher made all the class to listen to him read the book it was gay listening to him that it  BYE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"220",219,"Joey","I am a realistic person. May be if American philosopher, William James, were still alive, he could describe me as pragmatic. I believe that that is the way everything in the world is. I do not believe in Elysium as in the movie played by oomph daddy, Matt Damon or in Utopia , the superannuated idea of Thomas Moore. I do not even believe in the geographical places such as Paradise and Hell as what the Christians believe, let alone the Purgatory described in Divine Comedy which is totally feared by deeply religious readers unless we can figuratively describe them on Earth. Just I am staunch. Maybe I have been weaned on my background in social sciences. Maybe I am still ignorant less than people who believe in seven virgins as does the ISIS. So, with this perception, there is no wonder I did not appreciate this book, The Giver. I cannot bear with the conspicuous inconsistencies of the story. There are some parts I do not find fascinating.Readers may understand that dystopian and/or utopian stories could be fictional. They are the pigment to the authors’ imagination. In other words, they do not happen in real life as what readers put it. However, for me, fictions could be drawn from personal experiences since writing is an art, an expression of oneself. So, suffice to say that we are all in harmony that when you read such stories, they are fictitious. Enough said! … But for me, I appreciate dystopian and/or utopian stories more if they still cling to the real world. Sort of oxymoron. I wish the late scientist Stephen Hawking could help me expound what I am trying to drive at here. ( Bleary-eyed)Ok. Take it easy, Joey. Don’t mind the sea of bright readers, notably those friends of yours who gave it more than four stars lying in waiting, here on Goodreads. (Taking a deep breath)The first understanding is that the settings and plots are Utopian. Everyone just in that you-know-what place mentioned in the book is equal, has kind of socialistic and communistic life. You know as in what life in North Korea or in Russia before thought to be like; everyone has comfortable life; everyone does not need to be capitalistic to one another; everyone is given whatever job can be assigned to them according to their personality or life styles while growing up. What a superb concept! However, as you reach the core of the story, you realize that you-know-what place turns out to be dystopian. Aha, Moore’s concept is a trash! Jonas, the main protagonist, in the end, has found out that everything turns out to be the greatest show on earth, mimicking Richard Dawkins’s book title. I believe that dystopian and/or utopian stories are more appreciated if : (a)	people can relate to the dystopian and/or utopian situations; they may happen in their daily life. For instance, if authors write something which concept is about a paradise where people thought to be living without suffering from pains someday, as in life is peaceful and physically comfortable, it could be imaginably understood because people may interpret the existence of such geographical place, for there are many religions in the world. (b)	 the story could be beyond belief, logic, and scientific explanation. Why not make it interesting, something that readers may be ignorant of since they may have no background in the branches of science? For instance, magic witchcraft in Harry Potter series , but young readers are enchanted by it. Besides, it is a common superstition elsewhere. In comparison to the The Giver, there are some parts considered an insult to someone’s intelligence (Don’t take the expression literally) such as:1.	In the story, The Giver said to Jonas that love does not exist . My comment: I believe in this proposition, but wait, all along , all the characters express love as does The Giver. 2.	Superficial settings like some people keep an eye on everyone in the you-know-what place, so don’t ever hide anything such as food or your acts or talks about something excluded from the rules. My comment: I wonder about this imaginary place. Is it a colossal machine? There is an instance that Jonas and The Giver can talk tete-a-tete when turning something off which can record their voices. I think I should watch its movie adaptation. If you argue that it is the voice of the Highest Person which symbolizes God in that you-know-what place, how about the One in Elsewhere? I am sure you may argue that it is the same voice of the Highest Person. Aha, that you-know-who is omnipresent after all, a lame excuse for the famous atheist writer, George Smith. 3.	Cringing symbols like a bicycle for a rite of passage.My comment: Of no taste4.	Releasing babies that are found to be useless or people who give up on their responsibilities by means of injection or whatever euthanasiac paraphernalia mentioned in the story. My comment: The story may suggest that life could be taken away by the hands of humans, but it appears that humans are like robots dumped when they are no longer useful.5.	The age when a child finishes her/ his childhoodMy comment: This is what I have been blubbering about. This concept could make someone cringe. We know that this is unacceptable to the law of human development. We all universally know that we never stop growing as a child at the age of 12. This is the fact that the writer cannot distort. We can justify this fact. So can young readers. Do you know what I mean to say, buddy? I wish I could ask Lois Lowry about my points in question, but I forgot that she wrote it in the 1990’s. Besides, this is supposed to be for young adults. May be readers at that early age are not mentally mature enough to understand the story. Just they are fascinated at it. I wonder how a young smart Alec muses it over."
"221",220,"Amy H","This review is specific to the audiobook version only. I must say I was disappointed in this audiobook. The reader of the book really ruined it for me. His whiny rendition of Jonas made me wonder if he'd ever heard a 12 year old boy speak. He sounded eerily like Calliou, the four year old PBS character. Also, the sound of a grown man mimicking a young girl's giggle and baby noises is incredibly creepy. I'm not sure why he felt the need to add in the sound effects instead of just reading the book. Additionally, the music frequency and selection was odd. It was hard to focus on the book with all of the distractions, let alone to like the main character.I tried to pick up a copy of the book, hoping I would be able to get a better result reading it myself. Unfortunately, I couldn't shake the reader's obnoxious voice of Jonas from my head. I'll have to let some time pass and try again."
"222",221,"Ali","I read this for class and honestly I did not like the book. I had no choice but to finish the book because it was for a grade. I just didn't like how the society was controlled and how they killed off the seniors because they were too old. The government was similar to that of Communism and I just did not like how the civilians go about things because of the strict laws they live by."

"225",224,"Logan","How to describe this book? Take the hunger games.Subtract the standoffish yet likable main character, the romance and the very idea of love, the slightly comical mentor character, the fact that everybody fully understands the atrocities that are going on except the people with the power to stop them, the emotional attachment to the characters undergoing the torment because of the fact that they are in the age group of the target reader, the single all powerful person overseeing everything and enjoying it, the open act of rebellion against said person, the death of the perfect character, and a happy, if slightly disappointing, ending.Add in a dull main character who is chosen rather than volunteering to save a loved one, a dull mentor with emotional problems, the fact that anybody who knows what happens to those who are ""released"" has already been ""released,"" the fact that two people with huge power and understand the problems with the Community chose not to use that power to change anything, the fact that ""love""is not the right word to use with family, the main character running from the problems, the emotional indifference toward the characters dying because they are too old or too young and the reader is not familiar with them, a small tearjerker or two, and a vague ending."

"230",229,"extrapulp","Nasal, Monotonous, Flat - Disappointing.And dear heavens - it's becoming a movie. Featuring Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep... and no less than Taylor Swift. Gah!For the incapable of coping - ignoring the following warning will only save you from reading this book:***THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS***The nasal and flat characters of this story. The very life, color, emotion was drained out of each of them. I know, that was the point. They gave up these things so that they could have ""better"" lives.The ""1984"" meets ""Logan's Run"" atmosphere permeated the entire turning of events. No end in sight. Although I pictured mostly the cheesy outfits of the ""Logan's Run"" movie. The ""precision of speech"" and the absolute droning manner of the dialogue continued to wear me down. Things like ""comfort object"" ""requisition of ..."" ""bicycle port"" after being said a few times I tuned them out completely.I could predict what the next words were going to be throughout the story - so consistent was the dialogue. I knew what ""release"" was from the start. I wasn't surprised to learn it was death.The whole numbering thing, the age and numbering thing, the numbering age and dress and social thing. I got it - I understood the point, but the author would beat every example into the ground - as if I might have forgotten. It was monotonous.I know, that was the point.Then Jonas meets the Giver - and I think - AHA! Here's the answer! And then the memories come and I think - AHA! Here it comes! But Jonas flees with Gabriel and they drift off into the eternal snows - ""or maybe it was just an echo.""So 1) Did they die? 2) Did they find ""elsewhere""? 3) Was Jonas just playing make-believe the whole time?It was like one of those movies that after sitting through the whole thing the main character wakes up from a dream. It left me feeling cheated.And then I saw it was written in 1993 - I could have almost forgiven the book if it came from an earlier era - the '50's or '60's I could have almost forgiven it... almost."

"234",233,"Nikki","As often happens, I am in the minority when it comes to this book. I truly do not understand the high ratings of this book as I found it to be extremely tedious, dull and overall aggravating. First of all, I definitely caught on to the religious/Christian leanings of the book. The ending in and of itself had heavy imagery of the Christian variety--lights/Christmas tree(s), the child arriving and cue the eye roll. Also, the ""releases"" which occur, especially the one involving the newborn, definitely reminded me of anti-abortion propaganda. I don't know if the author purposely wanted this to be evoked, but I would not be surprised.Since this book is marketed to children I found the aforementioned release scene a bit disturbing for a young child, but I found another scene more disturbing. When Jonas first meets the ""giver"" he is put into a room with him, where no surveillance is allowed. Okay...a little bit of unease with this but let us continue eh? Then the ""giver"" tells Jonas to take off his tunic (warning bells people!!) and lie down on the bed face down (WTF?). He then proceeds to touch this young boy of twelve to give him ""memories"". And of course, Jonas is told he cannot tell others of his talks etc. with the ""giver"". Hmmm, this definitely seems like a great message to give kids.....yup, nothing pervy about it at all.And for more tame annoyances: there is no background to how this community came to be. If you are going to create a worthy dystopian world you need background. Also, the characters were flat and not interesting at all. This is of course part of the society and the lack of normal feelings etc. but it makes it extremely hard to care or to find the book entertaining.Obviously I don't recommend the book, especially not for young children who could easily receive poor messages (refer to pervy scene)."
"235",234,"Sarah Sassone","Before I read Lolita, this was the only chilling book I had ever read. This book freaked me out as a teenager and I have never revisited it. Maybe if I do someday I will not resent it as much, but I don't plan on reading it again any day soon. "
"236",235,"Stacey Stevens","I was disappointed with this one. I remembered it being a recommended book in school and comes up on several ""must read"" or ""important literature"" lists today, so I wanted to check it out. I had to go back and see when it was written because it was SO similar to other dystopian books (1984 in particular). Sadly, this one came after many of those and felt extremely unoriginal as a result. The end was not satisfying either, so I was disappointed overall. Fortunately, it's a short read!"
"237",236,"Roxanne","I did not like this book at all! It is a story about government control and the story goes no where. The characters discuss how things could be different and then it just ends. I chose to re-read this book because I didn't understand it as a 6th grader some odd years ago. I wanted to see why I didn't understand it at that time and now I know that it was never meant to be understood. I don't think the author even knew where she was going with this story...at the back of the book she's asked several questions and it's clear she doesn't have a path for this story. Her answers are vague and refer to the reader as the one to decide what happens in this story. Would not recommend this book and will definitely not allow my child to read this as part of a school ciriculum."

I am very disappointed in how there was no action in the whole book. This book creeps me out because of the fact everyone is controlled by weirdo rules. This book was hard to finish and it doesn't even end. You sit down every night wondering what the heck is wrong with the ending. The Giver maybe got good reviews but if you want a good book save your popcorn because eeks! Why on earth does Jonas like that creepy girl with apple hair doesn't make no sense. Gabriel also gives me creeps due to the fact he is invincible. I got bored reading the first couple of words even the title is what the heck. Do you like a book with no evidence just repeat and boringness. I am telling you save your money and time for something else that doesn't include creepy Muppet resembling characters in black and white. Jonas has no character traits at all I know for sure is Jonas is a boy with attitude. Don't read a book with this story because well just don't read something that may make you read something else sue aside like this. "

I was literally upset I paid to read this book. I haven't disliked a book in a very long time and I am even more disappointed that teachers are asking their kids in school to read this. I gained nothing from reading it, if others are, then they are desperately trying to make something out of nothing. "

"250",249,"Mugen","Too kiddish and cheesy dialogues. The events are really lame. The opening scene of the book describes a boy who ""felt afraid"". Someone is talking in a loudspeaker so the boy starts thinking of a past incident. [we wonder wat is happening at present because of which he is so afraid]Finally after a few pages he is still afraid and a plane flies overhead. Another flashback.Then people drop their bikes and rush to nearby building. Another flashback - this one ultra-lame where he is sitting with his family ""to discuss feelings"" and he is fighting with his sister on who goes first. Kid describes his lame feeling, sis describes her cheesy thoughts. His mother describes meeting a returning convict and feels ""angry, frustrated and guilty that she could not make a difference in his life"". dad, sis and kid all catch her hands and comfort her.At this point I stopped reading."
"251",250,"Sarahanne","I'm glad I didn't read this as a child. As an adult, it upset me and I did NOT like it. As a child, it would have really haunted me. I know some people love this book. Just putting my voice into the mix. Just because you CAN image a scenario doesn't mean it makes a good book."
"252",251,"Steven Magadan","In the ending it gives the reader a chance to choose whether Jonas sees a positive future or if he doesn't. Sometimes its not good to give the reader a choice, rewrite the book and make it so Jonas sees a confirmed, happy ending. "
"253",252,"Rain","Very simplistic writing style does nothing to hide the fact that the characters are underdeveloped and the plot extremely linear. When most think of a book of literary fiction, it has a conclusion that cements the authors views on a particular theme. In the case of this book, more philosophical questions were posed that gave no definite answers. I read a copy with a Q&A with Lois Lowry on the back, and she gave the impression of not having any answers on where she stood with any of the novels themes. This would be fine, if she were looking to instigate a discussion, but she wrote on such a rich genre, that any discussion would invariably lead to cross references with 1984 and Brave New World. The climax of the book was more on an anticlimax, as well. There was no confrontation, no aha moment where the themes become clear. In fact some of the well known themes of the novel are not themes at all, merely underdeveloped ideas. Lowry could have made wonderful use of the Bildungsroman, and shown Jonas' transformation through the receiving of memories in order to shape an adult ready to take action. But the entire novel takes place in the course of a year, making the boy's maturity surprising and in some cases unbelievable. This book is the subject of the eighth grade English class I am teaching, and it is obvious why the material is not fit for an honors course. I found the text to be boring and flat, rather than. Touting the complexity of language Lowry tries to idealize in the novel. "
"254",253,"Jeffrey Reed","A book with immense potential that challenges the very heart of morality, the Giver fizzles at the end. Lowry wrote the first act of a story and then hastily ended it without any sense of closure.I wanted it to be Ender's Game or Hunger Games. It came out like a poorly crafted rip off of the short story 'the Lottery'."
"255",254,"Leandro Guerrero","The Giver Lois Lowry i didnt like the book it seem boring and kind of made no sense at the end. being controled by the government Jonas and the Giver.being controlled by the government. i would recommed this book to other people my friends.because it might seem good to other people maybe."

It's mostly set up. And for all the time it spends setting up, there is just a rough sketch of a world presented here. It is as if someone promised to tell you the greatest metaphor ever, and then"

This is very interesting and boring at the same time. I would recommend that you read it first, before you agree with my opinion.To me this book was very boring. I had no fun reading this book. Now in a way I think this was a okay book. It had some great settings and a awesome plot. So I do recommend you read this book."
"262",261,"Grace","I read this book because I knew that everyone in school had to read it and I had heard the name thrown around. I wanted to read it so that the next time it was mentioned I would know what people were talking about and I would be able to join in. I knew nothing about the book, or the author and started it with a completely open mind and with no expectations. I despise this book on so many levels. I had to read it in one sitting so that I could get it over with fast, and the only reason I actually finished it was for the reason above -- so that I could join in when other people talked about it, but know it was so that I could tell them how much I hated it.I was not impressed with the quality of writing and the plot did not feel well thought out in the least. I felt like the author didn't understand or know anymore than the reader, and didn't care to think it through or explain anything. "

I haven't read it since then, but I have no interest in ever reading it again. I most likely didn't understand what the book was about, but it was just plain weird. If I didn't have to read it for school then I wouldn't have gotten past the first page. Obviously, it's not my kind of book but a lot of people say it's the best book they've ever read. I don't know, but I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone unless they have interests in philosophy or something of the sort. All in all, this is, and I'm certain when I say this, my LEAST favorite book. Ever."
"266",265,"Rorshach Sridhar","I'm sorry, but I just do not like dystopian novels. While their origins may have some truth, the execution is usually very poor as it replaces real, human emotion with a behaviorist argument that the environment will radically effect someone to the point that you wouldn't call them a human anymore. And while I'm all for exposing children to the harsh realities of the world, making them read pure lies isn't a good way.The book itself runs on a huge plothole. What is the point of The Giver? If the society aims to suppress all emotion and run things in their new ways, why do they risk exposure of their truths by keeping these old memories? It doesn't make sense despite being central to the book (hint hint, look at the title)."

"270",269,"Michael","I thought this was a very well written novel full of excitement and suspense. It made me question everything I believed in and I look forward to reading more novels by this exceptional novel....*end of sarcasm* What in the world was this? I did not have a clue who was Jonas and his family were all nutcases in the beginning. They kept talking about these certain procedures and assignments they had to do. I was so confused that I questioned my own intelligence. WHAT A SURPRISE, THE RAVING REVIEWS! UGHHH this book lacked everything a good book has. I personally hate that I was convinced to read this ""awesome"" book and I waited years for me to get my hands on it. I thought about giving it a two but my annoyance did not prompt me to do that. Jonas seemed to the be the only one that had potential, but even he was not sane in the head either. All of this gibberish about December, this and December that; I was hoping that all of the characters died in December.Ridiculous,cringeworthy, laughable, exhausting, overhyped, etc there are not enough adjectives to describe this. EPIC FAIL!"
"271",270,"A. Barclay","I honestly did not like it. I really thought the story dragged on (especially with always giving the memories - I know that is what the book is all about).

"273",272,"Moriah Writes-a-lot","What a disappointment. The first part of the novel is well written and the world is greatly imagined. The idea of the village is wonderful, enchanting, and full of potential. The climb to climax (since I am out of school and intelligent words fail me) is unstable and shaky. I told myself the ending would be much better, this book, after all, has won an award. But the only thing worse than the crescendo is the climax. Of all the possibilities to take out of this wonderful world what results is ""That's all?"" feeling. On top of that the end is unsatisfying and why I can't explain to you why or to what level this suckiness takes place I do advise you to avoid it. The only good news is that this book was short."

I found the constant shift in events disjointed, giving no real flow to the story. In addition, I found that the ending of the book was rushed. While there was significant amount of world building at the beginning, I feel the story failed to use the world around them and the concepts within. It was a wonderful story, just poorly told."

It was then when he discovered the secrets about his community. I am not a big Si Fi person, so I did not care for this book. Actually I have not many anyone else who has cared for it either. I probably would not have my children read this in the future. "

Somewhere out there my younger self was telling me to put it down and walk away, but I didn't. I should've. I know that now.It starts with promise. This is a proper take on dystopia. That makes it great, amazing, because often people confuse a dystopia with a post-apocalypse setting. This was dystopia. And yet... the ending was horrible. What's the point of introducing a world so wrong and corrupted if you're not going to fix it? If you're just going to leave it behind, and then leave the safety of the characters as questionable? What's the point? I understand that it has a companion piece but it is meant to be a standalone, not a series, and on that basis I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It's a huge disappointment. The ending cheats you out of a good story. Don't bother with it. Really, don't. I, personally, didn't bother with the rest of the ""series"". "
"294",293,"Mircea","NEW REVIEW: I changed my opinion and gave it 1 star from what I gave initially. I am appalled that so many people gave it high marks - it resembles me of the sameness Louis was talking about. I'll try to make my new thoughts shorter than Kelly's review:Release in another community as it started is OK however interpreted as euthanasia is not OK for small children even to be exposed to the concept. I agree with the fact there is an escape to in becoming more close to nature but the author does not take a position on it. Second, for a young child I think learning is the most important think, and for children to learn how to kill elders is definitely at least not pedagogical.Sorry, I don't have the precision of language ;-)OLD REVIEW: Great thriller. Very powerful. Well worth it of it's american medal. I even had a nightmare from it. As the latest YouTube sensation said a little drama is good for a small town however it is debatebale if scary books are for children. It started innocently by describing an Utopian society, then you discover the 12 year old ceremony, the beyond normal, somewhat quantic perception abilities of Jonas the main character that made him the receiver, the sameness, the precision of language, the giver, the and the release procedure - a synonym of euthanasia. Toward the end it was black like it's cover by the fact that it had elements that could be real. I found Harry Potter more positive in message. Finally, I am not sure that I did a good thing giving it as a gift to a 12 year old who can project and identify with situations from the book. I did that before reading the book. Anyway I enjoyed it and I hope my little friend will too specially since I heard she likes scary stories."
"296",295,"Klf Barrett","No ending.....WHat?"
"297",296,"Don","This was required reading when I was studying to be a teacher. I was horrified when I realized this book was being pushed to children, which was all the more baffling because it won a Newbery. I did some checking and found that for the last 30 years most of the Newbery winners went for books that undermine decent values. Most middle-schoolers wouldn't be particularly shocked by anything in this book, but that is most likely because they are jaded from overexposure already."

"299",298,"Shawna","Not my favorite book by all means. I picked it up because of the ""Award winner"" sticker. It was interesting, the author's vision of utopia. I disliked the ending. Did the hero make it? I will never know. Augh! :)"
"300",299,"Denise","I really didn't like this book. I've read the classic utopian society writings, which are depressing themselves especially when you read between the lines as to what they are really hoping to promote, but this book develops the concept as if this society has existed for many generations. It's scary and thought-provoking, to be sure, in light of the direction of country is taking currently. Still, I don't think it ends well, and I wouldn't say it was a great literary piece though I know it has won awards. It's worth reading because of the subject but it wasn't enjoyable reading for me."
"301",300,"Ruth","Progressed well and was interesting initially. However, it seemed to me that the writer thought there was a shortage of paper in the world, as it feels like he tried to finish up the story within a few pages at the end... A big let-down."

"307",306,"William","The Giver By Lois Lowry was an very boring book and I did not enjoy it. The reason I don’t like this book is it doesn't have an real climax, and what climax it does have happens To late in the book. This story is set in an area sealed off from the world where there are no feelings or memories. The main character is an preteen kid named Jonas. The conflict in the book is that the government kills people that are unnecessary to the community and don’t allow creativity. I would not recommend this book to others. All though this book has won an award I think it is boring and slow with no real climax or conflict. "
"308",307,"Meghan Taylor","I didn't really care for this book. It was bland. Just like Jonas' world. The whole book annoyed me, and made me want to chuck it across the room. I highly suggest you don't read it, it's not worth the time."

I am not into the whole ""perfect society"" and ""everyone is equal"" concept of life. Frankly, I find that a tad bit creepy. I couldn't even finish the book, I was so mortified. However, if you're into futuristic books and stories, i'm sure you would like this just fine. In my personal opinion, this is the type of book that either you hate it or absolutely love it. And with me, I couldn't see what was so great. I apologize if i offend any of the ""Giver Lover's"" out there, this is just my personal opinion."

"317",316,"Donna Davis","*spoiler alert*Wow. I was cruising right along with this story, but then I hit 2 snags.The first was not a personal one, but since this is so very commonly used in schools, I had a real issue with elementary kids dealing with a doctor injecting newborn babies' brains with a deadly chemical because they were imperfect. If this were billed as a book for adults, I'd give consider that a choice for the reader, but Lois Lowry writes for kids, and it is in just about every classroom and library shelf, starting around grade 4 and spiraling upwards as the US's literacy level declines.The second is the ending, which is unforgivably ethnocentric. Here's the spoiler. If you don't want to know how the book ends, stop reading RIGHT HERE. The unforgivably ethnocentric ending is when the child escapes from his artificial world to the REAL world, and he sees the icon (I think they say ""symbol"", not sure) that represents ALL OF HUMANITY. READY???? It's a Christmas tree. And that is why I hate this book. It is so unfair, and promotes an untrue idea because Lois Lowry forgot that not everyone is like her."
"318",317,"Cat Women","I think that The Giver was a book filled with action, and and many page tuners. There were a lot of times where I got lost in the book, because there were so many lead ins that I didn't understand. If you like action this would be a good book for you. I would also recommend this book to teens and adults, because there are many different lenses that you can look through while your reading. There is so much action in this book that there is always something happening to keep the reader interested. Because of that I often found myself lost or confused. Part of that is why I per sonly did not like the ending, because it leaves you hanging with many different ideas of what could have happened. "

Yes there was no freedom given to people regarding their careers, sexual livess,, relationships etc but was the society functioning perfectly with practically zero crime rate..then why this fuss ? Now coming to the Characters...Most of the Characters in this book are dead boring no matter what their age is..so its really hard to give a F about them. Thhe author didnt even care explaining how Giver, the main character possesed the powers of acquiring memories of others & how he could transfer the same powers to Jonas.1 more irritating thing is that there no jokes or small chuckles to keep the reader entertained..The only thing that I liked abt this BOok was its climax for which I am giving it a 1 star."

"340",339,"Erin","The Giver is one of those classics that I think every kid in the US reads when they are in middle school or late elementary school. Somehow I was one of the ones that never read it. I actually didn’t read any of Lois Lowry’s books until last year when I read Gathering Blue. I really enjoyed the book, right up until the ending. And by ending I mean where the words ended, not where there was any kind of sense of satisfaction or resolution. I learned after reading Gathering Blue that this non-ending trait is one common to all of Lois’s books, which made me hesitant to read anything else she’d written. But finally I gave in and read The Giver.First off, I want to acknowledge that this book was first published in 1993, and because of this you can’t necessarily hold it to the same standards as current YA. But at the same time you can hold it to the same standards, especially when its a book that is being called a “classic.” In either case, there are certain elements of this book that are very characteristic of the 90s in children’s publishing and writing, and I do have to account for that in my review.I did love the world building in this book. It really is the first dystopia for young adults to broach all the topics and issues that the current dystopias are handling: climate destruction, behavioral control, control of reproduction, loss of humanity, etc. This world focuses around a marginalized community where everything is controlled to be the “same” and “safe.” Jonas, the protagonist, is just reaching age 12 when you are assigned your vocation or career. And he learns that instead of a regular job, he is to apprentice with the Receiver of Memories. Basically the Receiver is the person who holds all the memories of the world before--the good and the bad--so that society will not completely forget what happened before the Community was founded. And of course learning all of these memories leads to great changes in Jonas, and eventually a decision to flee the Community. The most fascinating part of this world is that the people in it do not see colors; colors are something that Jonas learns to see. Colors are also closely tied into intense emotions, which Jonas learns to experience and differentiate from the simpler emotions that his friends and family experience. This theme of repression of the human spirit--through the removal of memories, both individual and universal--is very powerful and provocative and makes for a good backdrop to this story.What I didn’t like about this book was just about everything else. I even had problems with the world building. Mostly because there is absolutely no backup for the science. There is no explanation at all for how people are made to not see colors, even though the main character and society are quite adept at science and technology. The society is also healthy and fed without them having any concept of animals. Or rain. Or sunshine. Jonas doesn’t even understand what a hill is. While it is interesting to see him learn about these things by receiving memories of them, I didn’t find it believable that the world so be so completely altered as to remove things such as hills.Jonas himself, while an interesting character, was not a really engaging character, and it was hard to feel much connection to him at all. Part of this comes from the fact that his society has trained him to be sort of bland and empty, and yes later on he does experience intense emotions and moments of trauma and realization, but you don’t get to spend enough time with him for these scenes to really resonate. Jonas is like a puppet, walking through the story so that Lowry has a reason to tell us about this world. The fact that the book is told in third person, and a rather removed perspective, makes it even harder to connect with Jonas.Most importantly, there were no stakes--no real consequences--and there was no resolution. These are almost crimes in my opinion; and while they are things that can be forgiven by the fact that this book was written in the 90s, I don’t want to let Lowry off the hook. If you want to write a dystopia and really convey a powerful theme to your readers, then there have to be stakes. Life and death. We need to feel the peril that the hero is in because of their new-gained knowledge. We need to feel the turmoil as they are forced to leave their old life and persona behind to embrace their new enlightenment. And there needs to be dire consequences if anyone finds out how much the hero has learned and changed. None of this happens for Jonas: in fact, his society condones everything that he learns, and before he accepts his position he learns that he will not be allowed to be “released,” which basically means that they won’t kill him no matter what he does. So when Jonas flees at the end, it didn’t feel dramatic or frightening.The worst crime this book commits is not having a resolution. There are so many big things happening at the end: Jonas is leaving the Community and in doing so burdening all those he leaves behind with the memories that he gained from the Giver. But do we see the effects of the memories on the Community? No. Do we see the effect on Jonas of losing the memories to the Community? No. Do we even get to see where Jonas ends up at the end, whether he finds civilization where people see colors and feel true emotions? No. And no. All we see is Jonas trudging to the top of a hill and suddenly feeling hopeful. Then it ends. I felt completely betrayed by Lowry when I turned to the last page and realized that nothing was going to be resolved. And even though I knew this was a trademark of hers, I at least expected something more than what I got.Overall The Giver definitely started a new trend for dystopias in children’s literature, but I certainly don’t think it should be held to the heights that it is. Lowry’s editor should have sat her down and said, “Look, we need to feel your character more, and this book needs a damn ending.” I certainly won’t be reading any of her other books."

"343",342,"Cody Kes","I'm gonna be concise. This book was bland, badly written, and boring. Didn't hold my interest in the least and I only finished it to have an honest opinion and not just make it up. I mean a whole dystopia of color blind people? A sled ride to safety. Ugh. If they had a 0 star choice, I would've clicked it."
"344",343,"Erik","The giver in my opinion is an extremely horrible book. The plot makes sense but just feels boring. I thought the characters were dull and the ending anti climactic.

This book hit to close to home, I have twins, who had IV's in their heads, I have a baby that does not sleep through the night, and a grandma that still alive. "

"357",356,"Elyssa","This was a very original book, but I don't think that people should go around killing babies and Older people because they get in the way of their community. The whole point of this book is that these people have founded a ""perfect"" community, and they transfer memories of feelings. Why wouldn't somebody want the feeling of peace and joy, and tranquility? I don't think that someone should sacrifice all of the good feelings and possible very important people just to fund a ""perfect"" community. I think that there really can be no perfect place to live on this earth. Their community had their problems, and they solved them by killing people. I don't think that is the right way to go. In my opinion, every person is of value, no one deserves to die because they are a twin, or they are older. I do agree that it is an original idea, But that doesn't make it a humaine idea, or a happy feel-good idea. I found this book disdurbing and very depressing. "

"365",364,"Shalene Richart ","The Giver was a book we had to read in Junior High. It's about a town that when kids are born they stay home till a certain age then they get what they are going to do for the rest of their life by a council. Jonah gets the job have holding on to all the memories of the towns past. Whether they are good or bad. He gets help from The Giver, who gives Jonah some memories he has to prepare him for all the other memories. All in All I think that the book is kinda far-fetched but some people like it. I like more romantic books so this just didn't go good with me. "
"366",365,"Genesis","This is probably the worst book I EVER read , because I personally enjoy EVERY book I ever read. IF you don't mind some unusual environments, more settings, way of deaths , and ect. So here is my review of The Giver:The world they live in is followed by rules by our age. For example, you don't get your first bike until your like""nine""(somewhere like that). Another example, you can get a jacket with pockets until you reach a certain age. Basically, you have rules to follow and if you don't follow them things get complicated when your older. As a child it's normal to get hit because you're being punished. All though, it's not normal to hit an ELDER even if they being disobedient especially for a job ( I think it doesn't even mention being paid). So its about a boy who lives in a "" perfect world "". There is no fear or pain. Kids had STRICT vocabulary to follow. You even ask your parents if they love you!( how sad!). He does however get the job of the holder of memories or something( I hate this book and I have it so I can do what ever I want with it and I DEFINITELY won't be reading it again)... ( I felt so disappointed). Anyway, he is being trained by the Giver to hold good, bad, painful, joyful, and scary memories "" that the communite can't handle""( that just shows that there weak). He doesn't like the ways of the community and wishes to change them into what he feels is right.The EndingPersonally, when I realized that the book sucked to the bone I really didn't care for the ending. When the boy found out how people are released he ran away( by the way ... people are released by getting a shot that kills them)... ( yeah that sucks your young or VERY old and are killed when you think your going to get away from the community). He just runs away with a baby the community was going to kill because he wasn't behaving how a "" normal baby should""( just shows how much I want to cuss them out). My personal enjoymentOk don't get me wrong , if I DIDN'T hate all the details in the story I would pretty much like it , but since I'm not like that I HATE it so much!! It just pains me to say that. I mean how do people not know the color red... That is B... And when I mean B I mean the cuss word B... I think you would know what I'm talking about.** if I was alright with the setting and environment of the book it would be an OK book, but I hate it all so I'm not that kind of person. But if you are ok with the setting , death, and environment of the community I say that it can be a great book for you to read. If you enjoy the book leave a review... I still HATE it so so so much!"
"367",366,"Kaley","i hated reading this book"
"368",367,"Anthony","The only good thing about The Giver is that it only consumed about 4 hours of my vacation reading time. The story is not unique, the writing is atrocious (even for a book aimed at this age group), and the ending is even worse. I have no idea how this book consistently ends up on must read lists.Today The Giver has replaced A Short History of Nearly Everything as the most overhyped book I have ever read. "
"369",368,"Nat Sutton","I liked the message, but I think the author used the wrong method to get it across"
"370",369,"Laura McNeal","We always listen to audiobooks on family vacations, and I was so glad that our oldest boy picked this novel, which has such a serious look to it. Soon, however, I found myself wishing I could ride outside the car--on the hood, perhaps, or the back bumper--and avoid hearing one more word of this pretentious morality tale. Are we really supposed to believe the people of Jonas's Utopian community could (and would) rid their air space of birds? Are we supposed to assume they could biologically remove the ability to see in color? Are we then supposed to accept that if you're really perceptive, as Jonas is, the ability to see color slowly and magically returns? Is anyone else confused or repulsed by the idea of an elder of the tribe being left alone with a 12-year-old boy all day and asked to touch him in order to give him memories of joy and pain? Is there even a shred of psychological truth to the idea that a society could choose to live without memories of the past, and yet would designate one person (The Giver) to absorb and retain the memories of every single person who ever lived? I know this is a story that's supposed to teach children to value freedom of choice (as if American children needed a lesson in this at all), but the concept of memory in the book bears so little relation to the way memory actually works that the allegory falls apart. "
"371",370,"Renée","I'm so disappointed. I read this on my ereader, and when I came to the last page, I kept thinking there was something wrong with my digital version. it turns out that my digital edition was fine. I was quite caught up in this story and it just stopped in the middle of what I thought was the building of the climax. I feel let down and dissatisfied."
"372",371,"Jeremiah","The giver by Lois Lowry is a boring/ lousy book that takes place in sameness. It's a book about a boy named Jonas who becomes the receiver of memory when he turns twelve. He lives in a world of sameness no colour music race choice and no crime.One thing I disliked about the book was that it was a very boring non climatic book that had no plot what so ever for example the whole book.Another thing I disliked about the book is that the whole book is about one thing there is no fun in the book the people talk like drones and Jonas is stuck in the middle of it all. For example every time that you do anything the supervisors are watching you and you have to give a mandatory apologize to the community and they have to forgive you. The people aren't free they're scared to fight back and they don't realize it yet. The leaders are just buying them and if the people don't comply they get put to sleep. Its called releasing them. At the end of the book jonas risks being released. He leaves town and takes his sort of adopted brother out of town and they almost freeze. The whole book is boring and STUPID."
"373",372,"Maile B","I found The Giver to be kinda a difficult book to read. Here is why: The Giver was confusing because at some point of the book it was going slow. At the end everything happened in almost two chapters. In the book, everyone was assigned roles to do in the community when they turn twelve. The community doesn’t receive memories of wars, dangerous animals, colors, and anything that might hurt/ruin a community. Jonas, the main character, was chosen to become the most important role of the community, The Receiver of Memory. Jonas will receive the memories of true pain and pleasures of life that is denied to everyone else in the town. I would not recommend this book to a classmate because i wasn't very fond of this book so I don't believe others would like this book either. I wouldn’t keep reading the series if The Giver had series. I would definitely like a more action, mystery, and drama filled book. "
"374",373,"Shane"," The Giver was written by Lois Lowry I thought it was kind of a boring book,the book takes place in a community it is about a boy named Jonas who live in a town where it’s really simple when he gets elected as the receiver and everything changes. With the help of the giver and his family he can be a great receiver,until the visitor is about to get released so Jonas takes off with the visitor.One thing I dislike about the book was it didn’t have much action. For example I think they could have put more action into when Jonas takes the visitor and takes off. I think they could have put that his family was chasing after him and the cops were on a man hunt for him. They also could have put more action in when he was receiving the memory of snow from the giver and the memory of sunburn from the giver. They could have told how he got sunburned or why he wanted to ride a sled in the snow.I disliked the ending of the book. For example she could have added more to it so the reader wasn’t so confused at the end. She could have answered more questions because I had a lot of questions what happened to his family back in his old community. What did the giver do when he found out that Jonas took off with gabriel and is Jonas ever went back to his old community. I wonder if Jonas ever found a new family or town to live in.Overall I disliked this book because it was kind of boring and didn’t have much action. The ending could have been a lot better. My final thoughts are it could have been better and could have answered more questions."
"376",375,"Aritz","Flojo, flojo, flojo."
"377",376,"Wael","I think The Giver is not my type of books. Although the author surprise us by this kind of world, I think it is very imaginable story. The flow of the story was reasonable, but the end of it was not expected. The beginning of the story makes you wonder what kind of world is this. The main character in this story is Jonas who is 12 years old boy. Also,The Giver was an important character. The story tells you about how this world will look like without having an important aspects of lives. Jonas was the person who is trying to help his community with the giver. Personally, I don't know what lesson can be learned through this novel. I don't see anything can be related to reality. The only thing that I think is good about this novel is that we can rethink about some good quilts that we have in our lives. At the end of the day, I do not recommend this novel to anyone and if I was not assigned to read it , I would not complete it at all."
"378",377,"Anna (Enchanted by YA)","1.5 STARSI know a lot of people read The Giver as part of school English, but since I didn’t I knew that I was going to before I saw the film. From what I heard it was a classic, and one of the first dystopian books that started the whole craze, yet I found it boring.That’s what I would have expected from a book you’re forced to read as part of English because teachers hate us like that, but it wasn’t what I was expecting after the major hype from people with similar tastes to my own.I found the whole thing rather bland (and not because that’s the point of the world Lowry created) but because there was no action, or romance to get behind; or even characters that stood out and made you root for them. It wasn’t a very enjoyable read in general; sure it was quick, but that was because it had such a small page count and not because I was so interested that I flew through.It was basically a screwed up utopia, which now that I think about it is the premise of most dystopias. However it seemed to me that it could be easily fixed if The Giver simply backed off and stayed huddled away in his little corner, until Jonas would replace him and do the same. It may seem a little shallow of me; I know this is where people comment on the book’s depth and everything, but it seems like the easiest answer. (Also I don’t think I care enough about the people in the society to want change to happen).This is just one aspect where the movie looks to be very different from the book; after all it’s what Hollywood does best, right? Even from the trailer I can see that there will be more action and maybe even a little romance between Jonas and Fiona that was non-existent in the novel. So I will see it, but I won’t be continuing the series, especially since I have the option which some poor students didn’t.Posted on: http://enchantedbyya.blogspot.co.uk/"
"379",378,"Sophia","I didn't really like this book. The ending is really confusing, i couldn't figure out what happened..."
"380",379,"Ciao Jelly","I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, I think it's pretty good, but on another, it could have been so much better! I hate it when a book could be so much better so it leaves you with muddied feelings. The story is good, even if it's a little simplistic, but I wish the author had let it sit and developed it more. There is no explanation as to how or why Jonas and the giver have everyone's memories and how they can transmit them to each other. You'd think that since the giver has access to all knowledge that he'd go find out, right? All of the people who have been the giver have light colored eyes, which is considered rare and special, but there's no explanation for that when the scientists are the ones who determine what your genetics will be. Everyone is without a race, and from what's simply described as just being all white. No one is of a different skin color, there is no color in the world (did the geneticists make everyone color blind? Or are they magically repressed?), and no one thinks to question things except Jonas. Not even the giver had thought to until Jonas came along. If the author had used plain science and psychology, I could have gotten more into the story. Everyone's sexuality is repressed, which can have both positive and negative consequences that could have been worked and used upon. The community is basically a cult so brainwashed, everyone is a zombie. Everyone is meant to talk about their ""feelings"" around the dinner table, but they don't really have ""feelings"" (supposedly, from what Jonas says, which makes no sense). Somehow the leaders are able to watch, hear, and know what you're doing, but there's no mention of technology being used for that, nor is it questioned or used. And that makes you wonder how these damn people know everything about you. Are they god? Do they somehow have some kind of god-like power? It makes no sense. Or the part where Jonas and Gabriel can hide from the search planes by using memories to make themselves cold and hidden from heat seeking equipment. How in the hell does that work?! How?! Memories can't do that! This kid isn't some supernatural being! He's not special with having god-like powers! So how in the fuck does he do this?! You basically have to give up all rational and intelligent thought when reading this book to understand what is going on and to continue on. Many reviewers on goodreads have stated that the author obviously took elements from other dystopian novels, but they're so obvious that I'm not impressed. I know this is supposed to be a 1984 book for kids, but it reminded me heavily of Anthem from Ayn Rand. There is a saying out there, steal like an artist. And this author doesn't seem to know how. If I can spot all of the things of where you stole your ideas from, then it's obviously not a well written book. It could have been so much better! Instead of Jonas having these unexplainable god-like abilities, and him being special, she could have made him a precocious child who would sneak into different buildings and collect information on what they did, especially when he became the receiver. As the receiver, he's supposed to have this authority and power to want to know and learn all he can. However, he doesn't think to go to each different building with the different jobs and learn everything he can on them. He doesn't think to go see what the scientists do, to learn of them, or to explore the ways of how the community is controlled. There is nothing! This kid is told to you constantly that he's very smart, very bright, and different, but never does he prove it like how you'd think he would. And my younger brother just notified me that it's also very reminiscent of Bioshock, and Bioshock 2 with the memories and the dystopian nature it's trying to copy. He told me that, while there is a character in one of the games who is being used as an experiment to hold all of the memories of others, it is explained through science. Maybe if the author put down some kind of scientific explanation, I might have been able to accept it, but since she lacked that skill, it all fell apart. Another thing I noticed was the language. Everyone talks like how they do in present times, there is nothing to define or separate them from our community when they're meant to be in the future. 1984 separated language and created one which is reminiscent of our text talk. The Giver has no difference to it. There are times when the author tries to say feelings are important by showing them with other characters, but then contradicts herself by having them place human life as worthless because the plot says so. Nobody knows about war, but yet again, kids will play a game about war without even realizing it. And I just want to know, to understand, how memories can go back to everyone in the community once Jonas leaves! How is it possible?! And if they go back, doesn't he lose those memories? So how can he recall them then if they're back with the community? It makes no sense!!!"

The fact remains that after I finished this book, I was upset enough to want to wake up my sleeping baby so I could reassure myself that she was safe. I think that would qould have been better, honestly, is if Jonas had simply gone to the river instead, ""releasing"" his memories to the community. I usually love being emotional over books, and that's why I love to read - however, the ending did not suit right with me.

Perhaps I am simple minded, but wasn't this book about the dangers to individual freedom of expression as well as life in a controlled society? Perhaps this is unfair of me to criticize what is essentially a children''s book, but I couldn't help thinking that maybe the Germans might have lived in a peaceful society as long as they could keep killing Jews, lots of scientific advancement, regulating dissent, perhaps even socially engineering everyone's acceptability. In truth the book reminded me of a sanitized Brave New World. The image of the twin being ""euthanized"" reminds me of how we ask society to exist today: that makes me shudder. "

Will Jonas stop being the Giver? What will Jonas do with these memories? 	I though this book was very boring because there was no action, adventure, or suspense. When I was reading this book I just wanted to close the book. I thought this book would be have 5 stars but if i had to rate this book i would rate it a 0 out of 5 stars. When I started to read this book I was so bored and could not keep myself up. I would always felt like yawning or even sleepping. I would reccommend this book who like sad books."

"415",414,"C.S.","Am currently writing an extended ending to this book that will fix it. "
"416",415,"Carlajo Webb","I must be deeply flawed: I hate this book. I apologize to to the universe in general."
"417",416,"Selina","I realize that I am one of the few people who did not enjoy this book. At all. I understand the symbolism, I understand why it ended the way it did, but I still disliked it. The plot was disturbing on a deep level to me and although I read many disturbing novels, this one undid me a little. Praise to Lois Lowry for a thought provoking read, but his one wasn't meant for me."
"418",417,"Shontell","Not at ALL for children. This book was recommended to me by many teachers. They must secretly hate me, because about three hours into listening to this book on tape with my children, I had to turn it off. The writing was excellent and the story thought provoking until it detailed how the father killed a little baby. My kids were very upset!! Then, the ending was not nearly great enough to redeem this story. Sorry, but I do NOT suggest this story."
"419",418,"Brendan DeWitt","no like"
"420",419,"Hannah","hate this book soooooooooo much. it is really creepy. "
"421",420,"Emily Gebhardt","This book was really confusing. Lois Lowry did not really write the book well enough for me to understand what I was reading. The ending was also really weird, because he kind of just stopped writing. This book was distopial fiction, it reminded me of the hunger games, but no actual fighting against each other. But there was districts, and in those districts everyone had a special skill. In the giver, when you were 12 you are given a job/duty for the rest of your life. Jonas's job is now the giver, the giver is one person who will take the elders memories away. In the district you have no color or memory. This book was not a very good one. I would recommend it to someone who is needs a quick book. "
"422",421,"Erin Sweere","I read this in grade 8 and it is definitely not one of my favorites. I don't know if it was the fact we read it in class or the fact that it's not the type of book I normally read but I did not enjoy it. I didn't like the plot. In my opinion it was fairly uneventful. "
"423",422,"Sariah"," This book is strange, it doesn't fit in the categories provided, so let me expund. This book is a great disscussion book, I had a really good discussion on it with my mom and dad, but over all I didn't like the book itself but the discussion following was amazing. I am confused on what I think about this book. "
"424",423,"Thea","After reading The Giver, I was left confused and disappointed. It seemed as if it would be interesting, but you can't judge a book by its cover. The contents were very predictable. Quite honestly, I wouldn't recommend it to any reader seeking a fine piece of literature. It just doesn't suffice.The Giver is about a young boy named Jonas. He resides in a futuristic society in which each citizen is assigned a job, a spouse, and children. The children are born to mothers who will never get to see them. Trying not to give anymore away, I will only say that Jonas is assigned an important job and is challenged with the release of an innocent child. Jonas is left with the option of leaving his home, job, and family to save the child, or facing the harsh reality of his community and job, and enduring the release of the child.This book was dreadful. I became more and more dissatisfied with as I continued to read. It was a waste of time and hardly made sense. I'll admit, there were a few interesting lines, but far too few to continue reading after the first chapter. Although I finished it, I regret doing so. It was, by far, the worst book I've ever picked up. It proved to be mediocre, no better than what the average person could conceive. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
"425",424,"Kit","Mediocre YA fiction has a name, and it is The Giver.Wow. What hamfisted garbage. Does the author really need to spoonfeed everything to the reader? Does it have to be so watered down? If I read this as a kid, I would have been even more insulted. Soooo many plotholes and serious problems with worldbuilding.File under: books to dumb down ""special snowflakes"" even more."
"426",425,"Kara","Oh, dear. This was just bad. There's no other way of saying it. "
"427",426,"Karlie","One of the reasons I hated this book was because I was forced to read it in language arts class. I HATE being forced to read books. I'm also kind of biased against dystopian novels. The writing is very good. it was very descriptive, and I couldn't help reading ahead of the rest of the class. But the setting was AWFUL. nothing interesting ever happens in the community. The characters have NO choices about their lives whatsoever. They can't pick their spouse, or what food they eat, or their occupation, or have kids. Their children are provided by the community. you can't name your kids, the community names them, and you can only have two. You can't even choose what color you want to wear because the community made everyone color-blind! There isn't even weather; which means no sunny days or snow. They don't have Christmas or grandparents. This may make me sound like a cruel person, but the characters weren't suffering. why do we put down a book? because we don't care about what happens to the characters. if the characters are suffering, we care about what happens to them. The whole point of why this dystopian society was created was to eliminate the bad things about life, namely, pain, suffering, disease, hunger, etc. if there is no pain or suffering, the characters don't have any problems, so why should I care about them enough to finish the book? There was only one exciting part in the book where the protagonist realized there was something drastically wrong with the society, and decided to do something about it. unfortunately, that lasted for all of five pages, the LAST five pages. the rest of the book was torture, because nothing exciting happened. The ending was also TERRIBLE. the boys, almost dead (this was the only part where I cared about what happened to them), slide down the hill and then the book just ends. the stupid author doesn't tell us if they survive, or if they find happiness. I read something somewhere that the author said she wanted her readers to envision an ending for themselves. NO! You freaking wrote the book, so you should freaking tell us how it ends and not have us decide. I want to know how the mastermind of the book envisioned its ending. Stupid Lois Lowry. I actually liked her book Number the Stars. This book was a major disappointment after reading it. "
"428",427,"Sara Johnston","This Book was ok....I liked it, but it has a cliff hanger ending and takes a long time to get into. "
"429",428,"Ella Sindi","disappointing.."
"430",429,"Dp","This book was disappointing. While it had potential to be great it was a let down. The premise was really good and I kept waiting for plot lines to be further developed but everytime it just fell flat. My 13 year old was also disappointed. Not sure why everyone is loving it or why it got a movie deal. If the plot had been fleshed out further it could have been great. A complete let down."
"431",430,"Hannah Parrott","This book disturbs me. It freaks my socks off. I was supposed to read this book for school ( even though I had already thought it would freak me out), so I decided to get the pain over with and read the whole this at once. Done. Over with. It would have been much more disturbing for me if I had to deal with it in little doses. Through parts of the book my heart was beating fast and I really wanted to stop reading. It's one of those things, though where you can't. I had been told the book had a happy ending by a friend- and well, it sort of did. Not nearly happy enough for me, I guess. There are so many mentions of releases or birth mothers or other things that sort of scare me and make me angry. What's most frustrating about this story though, is the society. The people are slaves to the society. They have no freedom, no feeling, no differences-they aren't human. I guess that's one of the reasons this book had such an impact on me. I value freedom and individualism so much- and this society takes it all away. As for the actual writing, well Lois Lowry is a great writer.She accomplished what she wanted with this book, what any writer wants- to reach their readers and have an impact on them. And this book did have an impact on me. I got the message. I hope others enjoy this story, even though I didn't too much. But honestly, I think I'm glad I read it."
"432",431,"Lynn","Had I known this was a Jesus allegory I would not have read it. Aside from that, the writing was flat, and the book was full of contradictions that made no sense. Surprised this won a medal. "
"433",432,"Cole S","Cole Schoenheideperiod 7 REVIEW I thought The Giver was a terrible book. The Giver was about a world that is completely run by rules and law for everything you can possibly do in life. And I don't like reading about that because that's a world I would hate. The people in The Giver are extremely boring to read about because they have no desire to do anything fun or exciting. Jonas is a boy who is chosen to be the “receiver” that is a job given by the elders just like every job but there is only one receiver and it is the most important job, they receive memories of the past or outside world. The elders are a council of people that make the rules and decisions for the people of the town. This book shows the friendships that form and the ones that break and how Jonas is on a run from the elders."
"435",434,"Mindy","Not at all what I expected. I can't imagine why they think this would be a good book for children. "
"436",435,"Tram","Did he just die? Why? I thought the story was unoriginal and I just didn't connect. Jonas, who seems not very different from the other characters, seems randomly chosen to be special. But I thought there was little reason for him to be in the ""chosen one role"" in the first place. He didn't seem particularly able of wisdom, brave, or insightful like the Elders seemed to think. Character development was weak, and plot was under-developed. Things just seemed to ""happen"". There was little sense of personality in the characters--they were just so few descriptions and events to show who they were. I felt like I was looking at a sketchbook--just the outlines of stick figures available--the book felt that incomplete. I know many people like this book, so I found it weird that I didn't like it. Maybe I'm just anti-mainstream. I don't like One Hundred years of Solitude, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and now this!"
"437",436,"Katie Allison","I didn't like it very much but it was definitely different. "
"438",437,"Aly","This book depressed me... =("

The visuals I had in my head of the characters were in black, white and gray.I wouldn't ever read again I didn't like the plot or setting either that wasn't the best it could be.It needs to change a couple of things about it. I wouldn't recommend the younger generation to read it either."
"442",441,"Allison","Eeesh - what a bleak book! Read for book club."
"443",442,"Erin ","I didn't know what to make of this book. I found it quite borring and cruel."
"444",443,"An Odd1","* ""The Giver"" by Lois Lowry is named after the teacher who passes on ancestral memories of emotions, to keep society calm. This obstensibly juvenile fiction, because the boy turns 12, age of apprentices in a conformist gray society, is like pulling a flesh-color bandaid off a suppurating wound. A premise that we must feel pain to feel pleasure is bollywocks. Bad chronic agony dulls and deadens, so music is noise, sunshine means migraine. The simple easy pleasant style makes the lesson heavy handed and ponderous. I hope Lowry criticizes ""release"" because she has never been close to the lingering suffering longing for death, so later works are not so preachy and mistaken. In afterwords, the author claims her ending is happy. [Spoiler - The plot is cleverly appealingly built, like a house of bricks that turn out to be cards and blow away with a puff, same as the child's secure safe home founded on a father who lies after killing unwanted or unfit babies. If the runaway dream sleds to a loving Christmas party heaven, he has died, no regretful quibbling.]"
"445",444,"Gracie Miller","Not a good intresting book! It is full of twist and turns but not very exciting!"
"446",445,"Paige","The Giver by Lois Lowry, is a boring book. The book takes place in the Dystopian world. It is about a boy named Jonas who lived in the world who was created by Lois Lowry. In the book they released people. They had certain groups like the “elevens” the “sevens” and etc. He lives in a seemingly idyllic world of conformity and contentment. Jonas realizes how dangerous his town is, and he want’s to escape the town. 	One thing I disliked about this book is it’s not what I thought it was going to be. The book was way different in my head when we discussed in class. I actually thought it was going to be about changing the world. It was more of talking about “releasing” people and the group of “nines”. It’s just not my cup of tea. 	Another thing I disliked about the book is it was hard to understand. I don’t like how it labels people. For example, it says the people are “eights” and the “elevens”. It was a very boring and hard understanding book. I like to read books that actually interest me, this just didn’t do it.	The last thing I disliked about this book was the fact that it made zero sense. It didn’t interest me at. When I read a book I would rather have an interest in the topic. I would not read this again. I wouldn’t recommend it either. "
"447",446,"Angelique","how in the world is this a book for people of my age?first of all they drugged the people, and they injected them with drugs so they couldnt see color.they arent allowed to have sex with people, and the birthmothers are injected with drugs to get pregnant, and if they want to have sex they have to take pills to get it out of their heads.there is no such thing as love. the new borns if they dont fit their rules then they get dumped into this place with other dead bodys, and so do the old people."
"448",447,"Karyn","Well I just found another book to add to my NEVER to read again and NEVER recommend to a friend list. I thought it had promise in the beginning. The story was interesting an I liked how the Giver reminded us that we need to learn from all of our experiences, including pain. Then I got angry. They euthanize people for no good reason. How could the father kill babies?! I was enfuriated!Also, the ending. WTF?! The characters experience hell to only die? What message does that send - try your hardest to be a loving person and do the right thing to receive nothing in the end?I am so disappointed that I wasted valuable time reading this book."
"449",448,"Melissa Marie","I didn't understand a single thing. AND SRSLY STIRRINGS!?. The ending was a cliffhanger, I want to burn this book. "
"450",449,"Sofia","Great idea. Poorly developed. "
"451",450,"Pon","I had to read this for my seventh grade English class, and it was just a complete bore to me. It bored me so much that I would hide another book behind it to make myself look like I was getting into it. The concept is interesting, but the story moved too slow for me."
"452",451,"Lizupatree","I tried this as an audiobook - the unabridged version. I tried so very hard to like it, as it was an award-winning book. But just could not get into it. I tried starting over and listened to chapters starting over again and again, but just could not get past the first third of the book. I found it so very dull and lacking in color and description. "
"453",452,"Shahdi Rose","I know, I know.... EVERYONE LOVES THIS BOOK. I'm very sorry, I just didn't like it. At all.

"454",453,"Scott Christensen","This book is rated negative in stars in my book. This is one of my least favorite books of all time. I would never recommend anyone read this book, its not worth your time. This is not a thought provoking novel about society, it's just a disturbing thought stretched into a drawn out novel with little plot and the ending lacks any tangible substance. I don't know how this book got any awards or why we are forced to choke this down as a classic piece of literature."
"455",454,"Joyce","Liked authors writing style, did not like the story"
"456",455,"Russellbarabe","I did not like this book. First, it reads like a movie script leaving out many details. Although this leads the reader to keep reading, it also leads to my second point. Second, the movie script feel also leads to poorly developed characters. At the end of the book, I did not really care about the lead character. Third, the ending was lame."

"459",458,"Cassandra","My aunt and I were discussing this book last night, and we both agreed that it's a flop. It's as if Lois Lowry is trying to be the next George Orwell...for kids. Sorry, Lois, it didn't work! As my aunt said, ""First of all, you have to have the talent to write like George Orwell if you're going to attempt it. Secondly, we don't need a 'George Orwell for kids.'"" Let kids wait to read dystopian novels until they're mature enough to understand them. "

"463",462,"Jamie Nupen","I thought this was a very different book, and sometimes hard to follow.

This is a good book for those who like alternate times. "
"464",463,"Fatima","Bueno en este libro tengo un problema y es que no le encontre cual es su finalidad, que generalmente o es entretener o sacar un mensaje de reflexion al menos para este genero. Es un libro que esta sobre evalorado, talvez fue la epoca en cuando fue escrito,ya que fue el primero de distopias, pero para mi este libro es no es una distopia ( y lo digo porque soy fan de ese genero) trata mas bien de una sociedad utopica sin sentimientos y frialdad que se llevan de reglas y decisiones que al final ni me importaron. Los personajes al igual que la historia son frios y sonso, talvez de todos el unico que me gusto fue Gabriel ( bebe) despues los demas, que les podria decir, no senti nada, transparente.En cierto modo muchos pueden decir que el libro es muy profundo, ya que habla sobre el suicidio y la muerte y la carencia de los sentimientos, pero un libro que no despierta al menos una curiosidad de su mundo y sus personajes al menos soy de opinion no vale la pena."
"465",464,"Lane21","The Giver was one of my least favorite books that I have ever read. The book provided vivid description but it was boring at some times. I think the author should’ve made it more fun to read. However, I did like how Jonas got to experience the feelings from the giver. I think the ending kind of leaves you hanging because you want to know what happened to him after he passes out. Overall, I would not recommend this book."

"476",475,"Tuesdi-jo","Please, don't attack me in the comments for this rating. I know that EVERYONE who has read this book is totally and completely in love with it, but I wasn't. In fact, it was the WORST book I think I have ever read. I get that it is edgy and conveys a message of warning of political, social, and intellectual corruption among other things. However, I thought it was ridiculous and way too disturbing. (view spoiler)[ This book became preposterous when they mentioned that they had no sun. I realize that this is science fiction, but if a book is going to be written on the planet Earth, then you still have to abide by some science fact. The book loses all credibility when you take the sun away, especially when later in the book the sun obviously still exists because there are parts of the world that haven't bee affected by ""sameness"". Also, something that really annoyed is the no color thing. That is absurd.  (hide spoiler)] Lastly, the ending to me made no sense. The book was slow and drawn out then the last 50 pages were so confusing that I had no idea why everything was happening the way it did. It was just illogical. Again, I know that there may be some of you that really disagree with me in this. I am one of two people I know who doesn't like this book, and I realize I am a minority when it comes to this novel's audience, but that's okay. We are allowed to like and dislike what we wish. "
"477",476,"Gabriella O","The GiverBy: Lois Lowry9/1/15The Giver is a very confusing, boring book in my opinion. It is about a boy named Jonas whose life changes when he gets picked to be a receiver. This job is very important because the receiver holds all the memories the giver gives them. One of the reasons why I didn’t like the book is because how they killed people like little kids. The community they lived in seemed really boring and I felt sorry for them. The leaders basically ran everyone’s life for them. For example, the adults were not aloud to chose who they married, or what kids they wanted. They weren’t even allowed to chose what jobs they have. This is another reason why I didn’t like the book was the jobs. Each job was very confusing I kept getting confused what jobs did what. I don’t recommend you reading this book because it is very confusing, unless you like boring confusing books."
"478",477,"David M"," Dear readers, I completely hated the giver, I really don´t recomend it. The ending was not descriptive, you did not feel anything, you do not know anything, I specially did not like that part specially. Lois Lowry tried to make things look like they are not, it is supposed to be a utopian society, but it is a stoic community. I never liked the way people did not feel anything, never knew a thing about the real world. They will be devastated if the memories return to the people they will not be prepared prepared to battle. they do not even know billingsgate and they need precise language, not love, I hate it so much.

In the end, he breaks free of this prison-like life, but I still did not care for it."
"487",486,"Tempest Devyne","I cannot tell a lie, I was incredibly annoyed by this book. I will totally admit that its a cultural thing, and I can see why it’s so widely read in American schools….it’s incredibly simplistic and nationalistic: socialism in all forms = bad; freedom, individuality and specialness* in all forms = good…..well not all of us think that Ms Lowry, things aren’t just Fox News ‘they’re taking our rights away’ black or white. Life and all political structures do have shades of grey. *pg 121 ch 16 “he had seen a birthday party, with one child singled out and celebrated on his day, so that now he understood the joy of being an individual, special and unique and proud”.I’m rather concerned that this book seems to be so widely taught in Elementary schools in the USA….presenting an overly simplistic viewpoint children about euthanasia with shock tactics to horrify (‘obviously we find all forms bad’….erm, no actually there is room for debate about being terminally ill and looking at individual circumstances in the real world) and big governmental treating people equally (‘= baaaaad’…..give me strength).“Listen to me Jonas. They can’t help it. They know nothing”.....the implication that the reader knows better, there is no grey area, Lowry wants us to know everything in this society is wrong, bad and uninformed. Grrr. Rosemary takes her own life, on her own terms, because she can’t take the pain…..there are plenty of people in the real world experiencing sufficient pain and lack of hope that they should be allowed to do the same, but the book makes it clear that this is baaaaad, no room for question. It’s so divisive, and scary that our kids are reading this without any counterpoint to it’s over-simplification: “Things could change, Gabe”, Jonas went on, “Things could be different. I don’t know how, but there must be some way for things to be different. There could be colours. And grandparents”. pg 128 And don’t even start me on the plot holes and WTFs?! Ok, do:What the heck is the point of getting rid of colour perception? Why is seeing a colour a bad thing? Is it because the desire for sameness…..but if they’ve engineered out differences in colour of skin over time, surely it would have been just as easy (if not easier) to engineer out hair colour or eye colour.And anyway, there isn’t sameness….Jonas can see paleness of eyes as opposed to other eye ‘colours’...even before the apple incident etc…..and if the apple incident and seeing the change in Fiona’s hair are the first instances of seeing colours because they’re red and that’s the first colour to kick in….how the heck is he noticing ‘paleness’ of eyes, are we saying The Giver has a red tinge to his eyes?How on earth does Jonas shed himself of memories along the way once he’s ‘escaped’? The method for this is curiously brushed over, why would a reader need to know that?And how do you train pilots if they can’t see colour (and therefore won’t be able to distinguish between land, sea, sky etc)?And what’s the point (and how the heck did they do it?!!) of getting rid of sunshine…..it would be a much easier way of growing their food….I get that they now have climate control, but why not just factor in moderate sunshine and rain into that…...ohhhh I get it it’s because Lowry wants to show us in her over-simplified manner ‘this utopia where community make rules = bad….freedom and individuality = good’.....got to get rid of sunshine because heaven forbid there be anything nice in this community which she wants to make sure you realise is bad.And how the heck did Jonas’s family be allowed to bring a third child home in Gabe….even only a few pages into the book I could see that this totally jars with the utopian rules, of course a family would get attached, the leaders wouldn’t put this seduction in anyone’s way because it goes against everything of ‘sameness’....it makes Gabe special/different as opposed to the other babies, it makes the family special/different to other families, I just don’t buy it.And if there are speakers everywhere but only the Giver can turn his off, how come the authorities didn’t hear the family repeatedly calling the baby Gabe or Gabriel like they’re told not to? pg 79If no-one but the Giver/Receiver are allowed access to books, then how do the kids learn at school…..how do the teachers learn what to teach? Is it all done by word of mouth, and isn’t there therefore the danger of a teacher with a less than brilliant memory playing a game of ‘Chinese Whispers’ with what he/she teaches….leading to some classes being taught different things and horror of horrors, ‘Sameness’ will no longer be perfect?! What the heck? pg 102How come Jonas and the Giver can remember what they’ve just given away? Surely the whole point of passing on the memory should wipe the whole thing from the memory and they shouldn’t be able to remember what they can’t remember anymore eg. pg 117If the Elders don’t know about warfare, what the heck are they doing with things that they thought about shooting down the plane with? What do they need them for? If they’re worried enough about the danger of the community seeing colours….shouldn’t they be more worried that they might discover the guns? pg 112 And why are the kids playing pretend ambushes and shooting guns? Why on earth would a society that’s eradicated love not eradicate anything that could cause harm? And why call them armies, if they can’t remember warfare?If conception is done by artificial insemination, how the heck is someone expecting twins?And anyway, isn’t twins the absolute ideal of a community wanting ‘Sameness”? The whole concept of ‘Sameness’ would be far more believable if like in Huxley’s ‘Brave New World’ or Ursula le Guin’s ‘Left Hand of Darkness’. How do they maintain the balance of the community? If there are about 50 birthmothers, so 50 births a year(?) does this make up for people released for not obeying etc as well as the Old being euthanised?What WOULD they do if the boy twins had weighed exactly the same?Why has the Giver only just decided there could be another way? Clearly he was upset at Rosemary’s release. Why hasn’t he done something before this? Why did he need Jonas to bring it to his attention…..isn’t he supposed to be the one with all the wisdom. What other bad information or lack of advice has he given to the Elders because of his flawed wisdom?The Giver transfers all the memories of courage that he can to Jonas before the December Ceremony…..so how does Jonas keep his memories AND they get passed out to the community? I can understand Rosemary’s memories being passed out to the community because she died and could no longer hold them, but I’m guessing Jonas doesn’t die because this is part of a series of books.The Giver hasn’t passed over all his memories to Jonas, so surely the community will be in far more distress when he kills himself? How will the society not fall apart? Can the Giver shed memories like Jonas so he can help the community through the change gradually? Why are these basic issues not dealt with?How the heck did this win awards? It’s got so many plot holes and unanswered questions, is over-simplistic, with unquestioned dualistic morality….let alone the monotonous narration and knee-jerk character development without proper explanation.Basically ugh. I actually feel dirty having finished this dross and very much look forward to finding a well-written, balanced palate cleanser to read next. "
"488",487,"Rowan Cuadrado","I hated this book! The people are so idiotic. I really want to smack Jonas and talk some sense to him. I think the Giver has some good points and is actually trying to teach Jonas to be the man he will never be. I think the people need to learn some COMMON SENSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As a result, Jonas is a wimpy loser who needs to get a life and branch out more. :3"

"501",500,"Rin","I'm going to be very honest here. This book was told in a rather dull and boring way. Like reading lines of a script with no feeling. Or maybe it's because of my taste in books. This one was rather confusing. It was short and didn't really have a conflict. And the end was just... *shivers* The setting seemed rather bleak as well. The overall feeling, which I like to say about a book, was rather muddy and hazy. The mood of this book stayed about the same, just... Flat. I have a weird way of interpreting things, but it just means that it didn't really have any exciting feelings and I didn't really get into the book, if you know what I mean...There were no parts that lured me in, and the sensory details didn't work really well either. Overall, I didn't like it. (Maybe it's just me.)"

"509",508,"Michael O.","The Giver by Lois LowryThe Giver: I would not recommend this book to fellow peers because it was too boring for me plus that genre does not fit me. If you’re a sports person and your favorite genre is sports this is definitely not in your world. You will not get into it and you will not be happy. By the time you start it you’ll just want to put it down and pick up another book. But when you really get bored is when Jonas goes away from the community and he’s escaping with Gabriel, because they are just riding to find the place everybody calls “elsewhere”. A place in the book where I got really mad was when at the end of the book Jonas and Gabe repeats the memory of the sled and the snow. The reason for my madness was because I could not tell whether they died or not, but I found out that answer in the movie."

The story is of a dystopian society, set on Communistic principles. What I don't understand, is why the author chose this subject, when writers like Ayn Rand have done this before (with much more skill and entertainment). This is such a simplified version of Communism, and I can't even keep a steady pace because it's frustrating.I would never recommend this book. "

It was predictable and less and less interesting after that. This books end also didn’t make sense and made you basically come up with your own ending"
"529",528,"Faisal","First, I completely agree with the of J.G. Keely's review about this book so I don't have much to say. Second, it is not for children or even teens or emotional/unstable individuals. I'm a grown man and it still made me sick on couple of scenarios. Third, I understand it's a fiction or whatever genre but why not show the real massacres, genocides, rape, torture and such are happening in our world (in our mega community) as of today. Why not publicized the 'Real' stories? And make public to realize the heinous acts are getting done by people while we keep a blind eye on these subjects of pain. Fourth on storyline, if war and killing cause this community to live in secluded area where no memories of past exists except the few, what logic is that? Aren't people get away from wars and killings to live for a better life where past reminds them as who they are? Should't such information passed down to future generations, becomes a history and a reminder? Even though, this book has other elements of education such as science and mathematics but not history. Fifth, I only perused in reading it besides its fame because I thought I was watching The Wicker Man (1973,2006)."

"532",531,"David Gillis","I'm really not a fan of The Giver, and I can't find many positive things to say about it. Alright, for one, it does have an interesting idea about memories, and how the people in this world feel nothing until The Giver gives these memories to the chosen one. That is relatively interesting. But, as a child, many of the themes went over my head (because I wasn't a fan of trying to read into things) and I was also a bit unsettled with how many times I was told to read it in middle school. There's nothing really immersive about the writing, to me, and I can't remember ever wanting to turn the page to see what happened next. The ending is also far too much of a fairytale for me to take seriously. I can normally suspend my belief in stories, but The Giver failed to make me even want to bother. But I did learn from it. I learned that I need to know that not everyone will love what I write. I know this book gets a lot of praise, but I just can't get enjoy it. Every writer needs to be aware that his/her works will not always be enjoyed by everyone."
"533",532,"Andrey Shchekin","It's Young Adult (somehow I missed it when picking the book).So as with many Young Adult books, it starts with a reasonably interesting idea and then goes nowhere."
"534",533,"Talya","This is one of those books that is super short but take you like a month to read. you know why? because honestly they are just bad. This is one of those books where you look back and think, did i really just waste part of my life reading this? i know some of you people might have liked it,no offense to you or anything, but this might as well have been the best way to waste my time ever.this book is about a person who lives in a place where they can not feel, not that they don't want to it is that they are not allowed. If they do the will be ""released"" they will be band or killed if they do not follow the ""law"" these laws were made by the people who run the place the elders. this book has the amazing gift to make you depressed and pissed at the same time.  the plot was interesting and some of the characters where awesome but there's something in the writing that just made it sad and made people mad."
"536",535,"Benjamin","I had never heard of “The Giver,” but noticed that it was one of the most read books on Good Reads, so I ended up picking it up at the library. I was disappointed.The book has strong Christian themes, which likely accounts for its popularity.It starts out slowly, as we learn about a “cult” like society, where the council controls everything, and enforces strict control of language, love (lack of) and assigns children to foster parents, and determines their careers at the age of 12. Plus everyone is drugged with sedatives “medicine”. Jonas is going to turn 12 in the “cult” and is nervous about what his assignment will be for his career. That is the first 1/4 of the book. And it takes some stomach to get through it. There is no science is this book, so I don’t think I would classify it as science fiction, rather it is a book of philosophy. I was hoping that they would end up being on a space ship or something...no such luck.The novel just gets weird, and follows the story line of the Old Testament tale of the Garden of Eden. Jonas is going to be a receiver, which means that he will be imparted knowledge, (an apple does make of very obvious appearance), from “The Giver.” “The Giver” though the power of magic gives Jonas memories (i.e. knowledge) of things, which somehow people in the “cult” have forgotten, like the color red.Following the same plot as Huxley’s Brave New World, the “cult” is painted as a society without pain and suffering, (“A life without color, pain or past.”) but also populated by people just doped up on ignorance. There is a lot of plot issues that hurt my brain to understand at this point:1) In the first part, they punish people and people do die, so they must feel pain?2) Why don’t the scientists learn about the color spectrum or other things only the Giver is suppose to know? There are scientists mentioned, why don’t they do what scientists do?3) Ugh, would people really be this stupid? Wouldn’t people rebel, learn on their own, venture out into the world, explore, and just freaking break the rules!4) Why is knowledge locked up in one person? Wouldn’t it make a better story and sense if like in real life, knowledge is contained in everyone, and each person has a unique piece of knowledge that they can share with their own memories.5) The infanticide scene plays out creepily, one of the darkest things I’ve read in book meant for kids.6) Why does The Giver just give his knowledge (memories) to everyone? Jonas gives knowledge to the baby Gabriel, but wouldn’t this have happened in the past? The thing that bugged me the most was the idea that knowledge is locked up in people, and in this case a single person? Knowledge is built by experiences, places, observations, exploration, and inquiry, but the novel gives no details on the world, the environment, which makes the novel feel really flat, and synthetic. Sorry, this book was not my cup of tea, luckily it’s a kids book so not much time wasted!"
"537",536,"Moriah","What a disappointment. The first part of the novel is well written and the world is greatly imagined. The idea of the village is wonderful, enchanting, and full of potential. The climb to climax (since I am out of school and intelligent words fail me) is unstable and shaky. I told myself the ending would be much better, this book, after all, has won an award and many a rave. But the only thing worse than the crescendo is the climax. Of all the possibilities to take out of this wonderful world what results is a ""That's all?"" feeling. On top of that the end is unsatisfying and while I can't explain to you why or to what level this suckiness takes place I do advise you to avoid it. The only good news is that this book was short. "
"538",537,"Isabella","i honestly hated this book! it anoyed me so much! not just b3ecause i had to read it in school but becausse the characters annoyed me and the plot made me throw the book acroos the room. all in all, just dont read this book"

"544",543,"Sam Kleinmuntz","I did not like the book at all. The book made me think it was all adding up to a great ending, but just left you hanging with an awful ending. Possibly one of the biggest let down books I have ever read.Jonas is the receiver of memory. He gets all of the memories and no one in the community has any. He feels like every one should have memories to and he tries to break the rules and give them memories and thats how the book ends. Doesn't tell us if he succeeds the book just ends.I can't really connect to the Giver other than I have a really good memory. "
"545",544,"Prathamsinghdhanjal"," How good of a book is an award winning book with over a million copies sold? It really just depends. The Giver is one of those books that is popular and award winning. However, from excitement and suspense to being clear about important details; The Giver doesn’t have what it takes to be a good book. In the book there is absolutely nothing special about the futuristic society being described, giving a dull feel throughout the book, tempting you to put the book down and do something else. They don't even know what color or music is. Lois Lowry spends almost half the book describing the society causing more boredom. Jonas, the main character gets assigned a job (freedom doesn't exist in their community so he can’t choose) called The Receiver, who holds the truth about the community and what was taken away from them via sameness. He gets this in the form of memories from the previous Receiver. The author keeps throwing in more ideas about what the society took away when what it needs is a larger climax and more details on what happens at the end. The society doesn’t even know what death is, they kill people without even knowing it. They call this release, on page 150 Jonas finds out and screams “He killed it!” Release is an extremely crazy idea and would be unconstitutional in our society. At end of the book Jonas allows the society to find out what is out there and the truth about their way of life. It is shocking that know other Receiver did this before plus their society has been around for countless generations. Even though the book is lame it does help improve your vocabulary due to Tier 2 words and has a good theme about questioning societies, but poor writing makes it unclear and hard to understand. I would only recommend this book to someone who likes short, anticlimactic, boring books. Lois Lowry is a good writer, as she was the one who wrote Number the Stars and many other great books, and she was on to something when she wrote this book, but the final result of the great idea ended in a failure. One reason it failed was the lack of details at the end of the book. One person might say one thing, someone else might say another, because it doesn’t really tell you what actually happens, leaving you feel empty on the inside and left wondering what actually happened. So, no, I would never, ever, in a million years, ever recommend this book, ever, to anybody.Over all, this book was not the best of Lois Lowry’s work, and I rate this book as a 3/10 because Lois Lowry has written many other great books that are in the “if you like this book, then you’ll like these” section at the end of the book and the actual plot was incredible, it’s just that book was lacking major details and would seem like a horrible joke to someone that didn’t know that there was a sequel. Another reason is that I finished the book in about 1 ½ hours and was TOO short and to the point. To me, this was a mere children’s book. The main problem is simply how short it was. I liked the book a lot until I finished it, being left wondering what actually happened.In conclusion, The Giver was a good idea with the wrong writer. Lois Lowry’s style doesn’t match the style of the book: short and to the point. Let’s be serious here, the book really needed about 200 more pages to actually be an exhilarating and fascinating book that can actually be enjoyable. Most books in the Sci-fi section are long, descriptive, have a good plot, ETC, and Lowry doesn’t really have that writing skill, making her really fall short when she was writing this book. There are plenty of good science fiction books out there like Ender’s Game, but The Giver is not one of them. In my opinion, this book should be left for another writer of another time to be re-written by someone who knows what a good sci-fi book really is."

The book was confused, not very well explained, and we don't know what happened next. I fail to understand what was the genre of the book. It started as dystopian fiction, then became fantasy, then magical realism kicked in or not. And it was written for young adults. My 12 years old self would have been disturbed by this book. Now I'm unimpressed. "

Nevertheless I personally wouldn't grab this book anywhere in a bookstore and in the library if I have to read it myself.But the whole idea about a controlled society where they don't know anything about the outside world is really something. They don't know how to describe their feelings, they don't know how to control their senses. All they know is that they are them and nothing else. Everything in there community is controlled, when it comes to food, shelter, school, and friends. I was glad about the ending because it is something. "
"569",568,"Shane Beougher"," The Giver by Lois Lowry is a horrible book. The book takes place in the perfect society. It is about a boy named Jonas who goes on an adventure. His dad had brought home a baby who might had to have been released. One thing about I dislike about this book is it was hard to follow. On one page he could be sledding and the next he could be lying on a bed. The story is weird and different. It is all over the place crazy. and the story can’t clearly tell you about the memorys.Another thing I disliked about this book is it was boring. Every thing they had was grey apples, clothes, and emotions. They were like robots, in the story Jonas was different almost like he had some emotion. Like when he hears a baby will be released he takes it and risks its life just to save it. It is to hard to follow.This book is hard to follow and boring. From joseph doing one thing this page and the next he’s not with no blend to the next page. To It being grey and emotionless I would never recommend this book to someone. It deserves half a star and that's that. So if you're interested in boring books this is the one for you."
"570",569,"Zann","Ugh! I have no idea how many stars to give this one. It started out to be absolutely amazing. I loved it. And then things went down hill: #1 As the story continued I began to have my doubts as to whether or not this book was even appropriate for children. I have it on my Young Adult shelf here, but the book is sold from the children's department in the bookstore and is a Newbery Award winner. Seriously, I don't think anyone under the age of 14 should read this at all. I've read many reviews from people who've said the same thing, and one even mentioned that the book doesn't even fit the criteria for a Newbery Award. One review I read was from a 12 year old who said she had nightmares about the book! Why, you may wonder? Because there is infanticide, suicide and euthanasia, not to mention other facets of the character's lives which might be confusing and disturbing to anyone, let alone a child in the 9-12 age range. The infanticide is particularly disturbing. The child wasn't ill or 'defective' in any way. The baby was simply a twin and happened to have a lower birth weight than his identical brother so he was 'released' (which means killed). The injection was described in some detail and the last moments of the baby's life were also described. Other things which might be too disturbing for a child were the scenes of children working in the bath house and washing elderly people in a community bathing area (kinda creepy); having to take a pill, starting at age 11 or so and for the rest of your life to squelch any sexual feelings or feelings of love; parents who don't give birth to their own children but receive them after filling out an application and never even getting to chose which one they will get or allowed to name the child; once children are grown, the parents move to another area of the community to live out their days and children and parents don't see each other anymore...There's more, but you get the idea.#2 There were many areas where I felt the author should've gone into more detail. Some things weren't explained at all and with a dystopian world such as this one, more information was certainly necessary for the reader to get the big picture. For example, in the Hunger Games, we learn early on how and why the world is the way it is. A general explanation is given in The Giver as to the 'why', but nothing much is explained about the 'how' things came to pass. For instance, how did it come to pass that no one in this community can see color? How is it that some people are able to transfer memories to others through touch? How do the Birthmothers become pregnant since people aren't allowed to be intimate with one another and have no urges to do so anyway while they're taking those pills every day? Probably artificial insemination of some sort, but the author never makes this clear. Etc. but again, you get the idea. (I'd like to note that Hunger Games books were marketed as Young Adult books, with a huge crossover into an adult readership. They are/were not marketed toward children under 12.)#3 Finally, the ending...argh! The story ends abruptly. I kept trying to move my Kindle to the next page but there was no next page. This ending was totally unsatisfactory. I'm very disappointed. The book had such a fantastic premise and I flew through the pages. And then it just...ended. And not well either, I might add. So, for premise and a gripping beginning...5 stars.For lack of detail regarding the world and how it came to be...2 stars.For the ending...1 star."
"571",570,"Elayne","So i had to read the giver by lois lowry for a class book club. It wasn't very interesting in order for me to finish this book i had to take breaks because of how boring it was but at the same time its interesting and you want to know what happens next , it was boring but suspenseful.In the book there's a society where everything is under control you have the right to nothing and you cant disagree like we do here in the united states and other democratic countries."

"586",585,"David Bertasso","With the movie coming out, I had wanted to read the book. So many people had talked about this being such a great book. I was quite disappointed. Two main things bothered me.The premise of the book is interesting, and led to me wanting to know what would happen. However, I thought the book really fell short on ""world building"". I don't understand how any of it works -- is it technology? genetics? drugs? magic? And if they are changing all these things to get ""sameness"", then why is it only in the one area? Why are there hills and snow and everything just a couple of days ride away? And where are the airplanes from? And how does there happen to be a sled and the home? ""World building"" is one of the things I love most about dystopian novels, and this one just completely failed for me on that count.The other issue I had was with the author herself. The version of the book I read was a movie edition, and included a forward from the author. In the forward, she talks about writing the book, and how it was something new and different then. She talks about her book being ""introspective, quiet, short on action."" Then she compares it to current books by saying, ""Katniss Everdeen gets to kill off countless adolescent competitors in various ways during The Hunger Games; that's exciting movie fare. It sells popcorn."" The rest of the forward talks about how amazing and impactful her book was. From my perspective, she condescendingly mocks current books and places her own work far about the current offering. I really found that unnecessary, and really unprofessional. It felt very sour grapes; that the current books and movies are blockbusters while her's is just getting a movie now. I disliked even more that she wrote the comment without Hunger Games while obviously not having even read the book. (Katniss actually kills only one directly in each game -- although a couple of others die because of the tracker jackers.) Lois Lowry just comes across as very petty. That attitude (in the forward) also contributed to me not enjoying the book as much.(I still haven't seen ""The Giver"" movie, although I read a review, and apparently, the movie has been ""spiced up"" to make it more marketable. Makes her comments about the competition even more ironic in my opinion.)So, really disappointed in what was supposed to be a great book."

"590",589,"Vanessa OBetz","I read this book in March for my book club and very shortly after finding out I was pregnant. Perhaps not the best time to give ""The Giver"" a shot. I was deeply disturbed by this book, and while I understand that it the intention I was completely unprepared for the shock of the resolution. Or the shock of the lack of resolution. While it certainly did create an interesting discussion among our book club members, I can't imagine ever recommending this book to anyone. Except perhaps for the express intention of having a discussion about the utopia and fake reality created within The Giver. "
"591",590,"Keita Kawaguchi","this book is all about Jonas who don't know what's the real world was and what's is happening now and before because the books is just about the utopia world with innocent idea so, what's it's about is they just study and tried to figure it out what is the world is and what's really happens, it's sort of try to know what is dystopia was "

"595",594,"Macd","The GiverSeptember 1, 2015I did not like the giver in a lot of ways. One way was that it was kind of confusing with everything going on. I also thought it was messed up how they would kill babies. I also thought that it was not good how they kept all these people in such strict rules and didn't let them do much at all. I would not recommend this book to a friend because it is a slow book in the start and is kind of boring throughout the book. I think the main reason that i did not like it was because there was a lot of stuff that it did not explain to you and you had to figure out that. In the book they could not see color but as the book goes along Jonas starts to see color and then realizes that he has to get all that the people are missing back. In the end I did not like the book."

"597",596,"Sarah Karre","Really boring"
"598",597,"Alexhmkelly","	Despite having this book forced down my throat by my teachers, it was disappointing. It was slow moving, and the story had many faults. The ending was also extremely inconclusive, and there was only character development in 2 characters. She worded items in the world awkwardly, and all though they are words that exist today, “tunic” and “shirt” aren’t necessarily the same. Personally, I advise you to avoid this book until you are required to read it for school. If you get through school without reading this, I envy you. And back to the ending not being conclusive, there is one question that ruins the ending. Was it a memory?"
"599",598,"David Anderson","Wow, is it just me or was that a terrible ending to the book. I know there are sequels but when I read the synopsis of them none of them are actually about Jonas. I mean how do we know that Gabriel and Jonas didn’t just drop dead at the very moment the book ended. Because that’s what it feels like. I also don’t understand how at the beginning of this chapter is says that Jonas can’t see or hear. But at the very end it says he can do both. I also find it very interesting how coincidentally the sled from the memories is just laying on the hill. I mean wouldn’t that sled be like years old if the Giver received that memory from his Giver and back and back and back? Notice how I got that term from the story. I’m going to say this again because no matter how many times I say it just doesn’t feel like it’s enough this ending was terrible. I wonder if Elsewhere was really like the community that Jonas came from because if it was wouldn’t that be kind of pointless. I mean he basically risked getting killed just to go back to a place exactly like the one he ran away from. I don’t understand how when Jonas left memories kept on leaving him and going to the community. I thought that only happened when the Receiver or Giver dies. "
"600",599,"Beth","The Giver is a book I hear a lot of people fondly recalling from their childhood, so I wanted to check it out.You know what books I fondly recall from my childhood? A Wrinkle in Time. The Xanth series. The Dark is Rising series.This book? I'm glad I didn't read back then.Because it's not just simplistic (ok, appropriate for middle grade, I understand) but completely underdeveloped *and* heavy handed in messaging.SPOILERS AHEAD! (sorry, I can't review this without giving a few away)This book spends the most effort setting up a utopian world that's governed by rules and entirely revolves on the fact that nobody remembers anything outside of their life experience (and they aren't allowed to read books, so no absorbing through empathy).Although the only two characters with any time spent on them (The Giver and Jonas) exist within this world, their sole motivation to break it wide open is never explained. Generations of Givers have struggled with the obvious moral implications of their passive acceptance of the system (which they're pretty much at the top of...I mean, if anyone is the Big Bad here, it's the Giver, and there's only one of him) but somehow the existence of Jonas pushes the current Giver over the edge. And yet, the story doesn't touch at all on the Giver's choice, only on Jonas' narrative (which is also pretty simplistic: instead of asking internal questions, he whines, constantly).It sets up a plot and then changes it retroactively and, in my opinion, clumsily, which diffuses the tension instead of building it up. It also breaks complex moral choices with a lot of consequences into an issue of infanticide, thus allowing Jonas to be the Hero Who Never Thinks About What He's Doing. And thus, the hero whose actions are going to cause a lot more pain and suffering than he's ""saving"" Gabe from.And then....it ends. I was waiting for Jonas to grow as a character (somehow. anyhow. Please!) and suddenly he's biking toward a town with Christmas lights (to the book's credit, I didn't see the super Christian allegory until that random moment) and The End.WHAT?! What did I just read, here?? It's not a dystopian, it's not a coming of age, it's not a journey adventure (or at least, not a very compelling one). There's absolutely no conclusion to be had, and because there's no character development driving the plot, I have zero motivation to pick up book two.To no one's surprise, I don't recommend this. Have your kids read Gregor and the Overland series (which is entertaining, emotional, AND well written) instead."
"601",600,"Teannyha Jenkins-russ","I didn't like the giver at all. "
"602",601,"Maggie","This book was completely ruined for me by my 7th grade English teacher."
"603",602,"Georgia","The Giver by Lois Lowry is a futuristic, rather depressing story about our world taking place hundreds of years later. The book is both powerful and effective and really paints a picture in the reader’s head of the background and scenery. It is very descriptive but for me it was somewhat difficult to follow and I was confused multiple times. Especially when the author was introducing the idea of animals not existing in their world. It brought in new elements like this to the story without explaining the concept beforehand or even directly after. A college or high school level student might be able to catch on but from a thirteen year old’s perspective it was difficult to comprehend this new idea. Finally several chapters later, The Giver explained the concept of animals to Jonas but at that point I was totally lost in the story. This was frustrating but also included an element of mystery I haven't experienced in a book before. This part would be both a strength and weakness.  	Some parts of the story weren’t quite age appropriate in my opinion in the scare factor as well. Killing babies isn’t exactly what I would call a cheerful concept or a thirteen year old basically committing suicide by injecting herself with a deadly concoction that she knew would take her life. After finishing the book instead of feeling light and happy or inspired like I usually do after reading something amazing, I felt cold, moody and depressed. This really shows what kind of author Lois Lowry is. I would not recommend this book to another classmate or friend because I felt that even though the book held much depth and was powerful that it would just create more people to feel like a cold dark shadow has overcome them unless you are interested in dark books.  	If this book was in a series I would read a couple of chapters just because there was not a proper ending to this book and it felt incomplete. Ending a story with the sentence “or perhaps it was only an echo” leaves me with hundreds of questions. I would want to know what actually happened and get a proper ending I felt other readers and I deserved. My advice for this author is to write a sequel to The Giver and create a happy, proper ending to the story and make it joyful and exciting to read. Also an apology for also categorizing it as a book for youth. The book should also include a bright and colorful cover without any creepy old men on it. "

"607",606,"Chelsean2012","I absoulutely hated this book. The Giver was the worst book that I have ever read. It was so boring, confusing, and long. I couldn't stay focused during this book and when it came to the test I failed.The Giver was boring because the characters did not really have anything interesting about them. They were dry and dull. They were not funny at all. They also did not stick to me. I could not remember any of the characters names and the setting was not clear. While reading this I practically feel asleep on every page. That is mainly why I couldn't remember anything about this book.This book was also very confusing. I think that this book was written on a high school level and i read it in the 5thgrade. Back then I couldn't really comprehend this book very well that's why I kept constantly getting lost and confused. I think that I was too young to be reading a complex book such as The Giver. Therefore, I found it to be confusing.The Giver was also very long. While reading this book I wasn't able to read all the pages in the chapters as fast as everybody else could because the words were very small and too long. Thats whym when it came to the test I did not pass because of this corny book.I do not recommend this book to anyone. It is a big waste of time. It is boring, confusing and extremely long. This book would do nothing but confuse you. So in my opinion do not read this book. Trust me you probalby will not like it just like me."
"608",607,"Trevor","This story is about a 12-year-old boy named Jonas who must choose between the world he has always lived in filled with sameness or one that is filled with emotions, including the joys and pains of life.Jonas lives in a perfect, utopian society, where there are no choices. Everything in Jonas's world seems to fit in order. Each family has a mother, a father, and two children, one of each gender. The families are chosen by the Elders. No child is biologically related to their parents. The ederly, as well as the newest members of the community, are all lovingly cared for. Despite the sameness in the society, there is happiness. There is no crime, no disease, no pain, no rudeness and no unemployment. The community lives in a peaceful existence.Every person in Jonas's community is assigned a role, or job, which he or she is suited for emotionally, physically and mentally. When Jonas turns 12, Jonas is given his life assignment as the Receiver of Memory. As the Receiver of Memory, Jonas will be the one person to bear the memories of a society that lives only in the present. Which is a huge job that Jonas will have to deal with for the rest of his life. "
"609",608,"Jon M","A lot of kids at my school had read this book in, like, fourth and fifth grade, so I said, ""I don't really read books, but because everyone else likes this book, I'll do it anyways!""So I went to the library and asked if they had The Giver and the librarian told me that it was a very challenging book and that highschoolers can't even manage to read it, and that I was a dumb chump who only read comics and blah, blah, blah. But I didn't listen and told her and thought that no one was gonna stop me from reading that novel.So she gave me the book and I walked back upstairs to my classroom, sat down, and looked at the cover. It had some guy on it who looked like Gandalf and a bunch of trees. I opened it and read the first page, which had a lot of words in very small print, which made it almost impossible to read. That, and it made no sense.I learned my lesson, which is to stay away from normal books (which, in my book [get it? Book pun] is not a comic book, as much as possible)."
"610",609,"Jbocks40","The Giver was a book that i had to read for school. I don’t think that it was very realistic. It is impossible to brainwash every citizen of every memory. Also, you can not change the weather to always be the same all the time. The idea of a utopian society is one that is unrealistic, and the concepts in the book are not very fun. Puberty pills are totally unrealistic, and hormones are a part of life that is important. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone ever."
"611",610,"Sean Resavy","I finished the Giver, Jonas and Gabriel ran away from their community and Jonas had to give Gabriel memories to keep him warm during harsh weather. I did not like the end of the story for a couple of reasons. First of all the author does not clearly state what happens to Jonas and Gabriel. For all we know they could have gotten to the next community and were released for entering, we saw how welcoming they were to the plane that flew off track. Secondly, the Author did not do into what happened to the community when Jonas left. Did the community fall apart? I realize that the Author wanted us to use our imagination, but a little direction would be nice. Over all i did not really like this book. In trying to portray a bland desensitized community, the author bored me. The conformity of the people in the book made me angry. The fact that the people were so accepting to not having a choice in what they do, what they wear, or who they are with is annoying. I would not recommend this book to my friends because i don't think they would find it interesting."

"623",622,"Beth Gallaspy","This book seems driven by an interesting idea of a dystopian society, but without interesting, fully developed characters, it's a long, cautionary parable rather than an engaging piece of fiction. To make matters worse, Lowry doesn't even provide the payoff of showing readers her vision of what happens to the community after Jonas leaves. Apparently, this book has been a favorite of young readers. So hooray for anything that gets kids reading. Maybe this will whet their appetites for meatier stuff. I've read much better YA fiction. "
"624",623,"Elin","I don't even understand why I kept on reading this book.

"627",626,"Krystol","I'm probably in the minority here, but when I finished ""The Giver"" all I felt was a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. As a writer myself, I've been told by my husband that I often have trouble with ""the willing suspension of disbelief"" and I feel that quality is needed to read this book. It wasn't badly written, in fact the world is quite interesting. I only wish it had been explained better. I understand the concept of a ""Utopian Society"" but some of the things they had achieved just seemed ridiculous. I know that is a lot to ask from a children's book, but at the same time, I can't imagine letting my CHILD read this particular book because of the subject matter. The thing is, I felt a lot of things while reading ""The Giver"" and none of them were particularly positive. First, I was interested when I started reading because so many of my friends had suggested it to me. It wasn't long before confusion set in and unfortunately this feeling didn't really lift for the entire book. There were too many things that hadn't been explained properly, that just didn't make sense at all. I mean, how could society get rid of sunshine? How could they get rid of colors, or even just perceptions of colors? How were certain people able to transfer memories like magic? I mean, really? The concept is well and good I suppose, but it just doesn't have any basis other than ""This is the way we say it is in the book so you'll just have to take our word for it."" The whole concept of ""Sameness"" has been done before, but not quite to this degree. It was brave, but because it was never explained how it happened, I just can't buy it. I also felt horror and disgust crop up from time to time, but when it came on the last time it never left. The first time I felt it, it was because of the ""Stirrings."" While I understand the concept of wanting to keep people from having sex or feeling love, it was done in the creepiest way possible. I'm sorry, but the naked dream about an eleven year old girl? Do children really need to read this? The second and definitely most disturbing was the casual way society dealt with ""Release."" Yes, from the beginning I had a feeling that it was referring to death and thought it was horrible that a child could ever be subjected to that. When, near the end of the book, you actually see Jonah's father ""releasing"" a newborn baby... I wanted to vomit and that feeling only intensified with a conversation a short time later where Jonah's father actually voted to ""release"" a toddler who was a fairly main character by that point. I'm sorry, but when books like this are being assigned or read aloud in Elementary classrooms I have to wonder where society is headed. I struggled hard enough with these subjects as an adult. I can't imagine having read them as a child. And also, if some of my questions get answered in the other books? I'd rather never know the answers. It's not worth subjecting myself to more of that."

"631",630,"Cole","THE GIVERThe Giver by Lois Lowry is a fun book. It takes place in a Utopian city where nothing bad happens and the rules are very strict. It’s about a boy named Jonas who is given a job in the city and goes on his first day and is in for a treat. He learns the towns memories and then realizes it's not a good thing to live there. So he makes a plan.	One thing I disliked about this book is how many rules there were. For example, as a girl if you didn’t have your bows tied they made an all call to the community. As a reminder to always have them tied correctly and not too loose. Or as a boy if your buttons weren’t buttoned all the way, they would make an announcement. Or if you were at a place you shouldn’t have been, then they would let you know about it.Another thing I disliked about this book was that there was little to no action which in turn, made it a very slow read. The book was not only a slow read, but hard to follow because there was no action that made you want to flip the page. For example, during the ceremonies, they just talked about boring rules and other perspectives of what they felt about each ceremony. I felt like the book took forever to read because it didn’t make you want to flip the page. They could’ve made it more clear what being released meant and then went through the process of it and what the elderly would’ve gone through.	Overall I disliked the book because it was very hard to understand and it didn’t really keep me guessing. My final thoughts on this book is that they should’ve put more action in it. She should’ve put less explaining into it because most of the time it would’ve explained itself. I would’ve asked her to make a few changes on the the action scenes and less on the explaining. Overall I would give this book one star. "

"647",646,"Oliver P.","I’m not big in reading books, but this book ruins everything for me. This book has no good parts in it, it’s all just long and boring. Why they made this book into a movie? I have no clue, but I’d be surprised if it was even worse than the book. Even at the end of the book it left a cliffhanger, that gave me no reason to read the next book. 10/10 would not read again, or recommend to my worst enemy."
"648",647,"Becky","They need a star that says ""hated it with a passion"". The ONLY reason I would recommend this book (and not to children) is because of the fact that it helped me to understand more fully the importance of agency. ""There MUST be opposition in all things"" - otherwise we would have no agency, and everything that that entails. No love, no hate, there would be an end of feeling all together. This book is a horrible description of what life would be like if Satan had prevailed. "
"649",648,"Amandine","Première chose que je n'ai pas aimé au sujet de ce roman, c'est la façon dont il commence. L'auteur, Lois Lowry, a écrit un chapitre entier afin de se venter de son livre, de son succès, de ses fans. Au début je n'ai même pas compris qu'il s'agissait d'une note de l'auteur. J'avais l'impression que le livre avait débuté tellement je trouvais le narrateur prétentieux. Ensuite je suis rentrée dans l'histoire de Jonas. L'idée d'un monde futuriste, sans couleur, où tout est contrôler, me plait énormément. J'aime beaucoup les romans à science fiction de ce type (Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, Delirium...). Ce roman avait donc tout pour me plaire. J'ai commencé à lire lors de mon trajet vers et au retour du boulot. J'ai une heure de métro. Le livre était vite fini. Pourtant je ne l'ai pas dévoré avec beaucoup d'excitation. J'avais plutôt l'impression d'essayer de le finir pour que ce soit fait. Histoire de ne pas jeter mon argent par la fenêtre en m'arrêtant de lire. Ce livre est Blah. Voilà le sentiment qu'il m'en a donné. Au début c'est intéressant, quoi qu'un peu lent. On comprend très vite ce qui va se passer. Je n'ai pas trop compris le sens du livre. Comme un goût de trop peu."
"650",649,"Shontaa Towns","Jonas was a boy that lived in the community and he had a life like the others. When he was litle he had a friend didnt speak right so he got punished.When Jonas was a tweleve he got called to be a receiver,whiched havent happened in about 10 years. So when he was a receiver he went to the giver and then he was receving sunburn,snow,red and the little twins. he couldnt tell his mother what he was learning. he didnt like the rules so he left and then he wanted the giver to come with him but the giver couldnt. So when he was about to leave the giver told him that he wasnt able come back.So when he and Gabe left for Elsewhere they thought they wouldnt make it because the road was so narrow and long he left the clothes and the bike by the bushes."

"652",651,"Christa","Very disturbing book. I hope my children aren't ever assigned this book for school because I wouldn't let them read it. It would be very upsetting to them."
"653",652,"Toni Biery","The Giver by Lois Lowry is a weird, yet interesting book. The book takes place in a “perfect” society. It is about a boy named Jonas who lives in the “perfect” society. Well he thinks it’s perfect until they get behind closed doors. Once those doors are closed it turns into a whole new ball game. Everyone changes and turns into a different person. One thing I liked about this book is that it was very descriptive. It explains things, but it is also confusing at the same time. For example saying that the people of the community were released, it doesn't mean what you think it does. Lois Lowry said that the characters were released all the time. You have to read and understand to know what I mean. One thing I disliked about this book is how it doesn't make since. Like at one moment you're in the present the next you're in the past. During the chapters you will have asterisk signs and that's when you change time. It is very confusing. If you understand what I mean.Overall, I had mixed feelings about this book because I get confused easily. This book confused me alot. Also, I would not recommend this book unless you like books that have no expression whatsoever, or bland books. It was very boring than towards the middle it got interesting. It was a slow book until the end than it started to speed up. "

I forced myself to like this book but I end up having forced myself for finishing it. The book doesn't have anything. Seriously, nothing. I would put this in the category of Shiva trilogy. Both these books try to show the present world with their illogical and stupid reasons as some kind of dystopian/utopian worlds. I think this is not my genre. The book cover is really beautiful. That's all I can say."

Jonas lives in a flawless place where there is no sadness, no choices, and you are assigned your job for the rest of your life. When Jonas is twelve, he is assigned a special job, and leaves for immediate training from The Giver. He discovers where all the pain and suffering goes: to him. And there is nothing he can do about it. I am sorry to say, I hated this book. It was very cliche and boring to me. I was uninterested throughout the entire book and only finished it for an English assignment. I do not recommend this book to anyone, but if i must, it would be to adults because they seem to like it much more than younger people."

"683",682,"Zach Tork","I read this book by force for an English class. It was awful. It was such a waste of time. The book basically wants you to think, ""Okay, imagine you're in a ridiculous society with a ridiculous situation. What would you do?"" The book sets up nothing. It dabbles in the paranormal for no reason and doesn't ever explain it. I often hear that it's up to the reader to come up with those things but I honestly feel that it was the author's laziness to explain them or the lack of even caring to. I never understood why the book had to have a paranormal involvement at all. It bothered me that it was never gradually made apparent to the reader. It was just there like it was normal in everyday society. I understand a lot of books are ridiculous situations but this one pretends like it's serious about it all. As if this book were to show people where society will be in 100 years or something like 1984. But The Giver is so off base, there's nowhere to even begin. It was a royal waste of time and I wish no one else the pain of having to have their mind tortured by all the inconsistencies this book has to offer."
"684",683,"Julia","I felt the need to make a review about this book after we had a discussion about it. This book will make you think. While I read it, I kept comparing our society to the dystopian society they live in. Is it actually unusual? Or, is it just unusual, because that's not what we are use to. If we lived in what we call their perfect society, what would we think about think about the actual society we live in right now. I can't imagine how it is like having all those memories and feelings, yet no one else does. How was everyone elses moods, if they don't have feelings and memories? I would go insane if I were the Giver.I would like to re-read this book again to understand why Jonas wants feelings and memories. Defintely a book to read if you are able to step out of the normal, light hearted books we tend to get use to reading!"

Although it has many rave reviews and was cited by some as one of the best books of our generation, I did not see much either good or bad in it. It was kind of just blah....I expected a lot more out of this story, but was it was so short that the story just was not able to fully develop as it should have. I will admit there are some amazing short books outcthete that could not be made better by being longer. But not many... and this is definitely not one of them. Also it left you with a lot of questions not wrapping up many of the different loose ends. I suppose that the author possibly left it that way on purpose , but if he was trying to convey something without coming right out and saying it then he did not do a very good job. :-/"
"708",707,"Mr. Borgerding","Building one illogical conceit upon another, Lowry creates the non-sensical dystopia of the place with no feelings or emotions or colors or weather or landscapes or technology or pain or fun or . . . This is like The DiVinci Code in its total schmear of dumbness. The main character is not unlikable, but his actions and the plot is so lacking in relatable touchpoints that from the introduction of the ""Giver"" the whole business turns into a dumpster fire of tremendous leaps of logic. If you want to learn about the importance of feelings in a world where they seem to be devalued, read A Day No Pigs Would Die. If you want to perpetrate bad literature on others, encourage them to read The Giver."

I thought it was boring and had no real excitements but only in the beginning. At the end it was intense and dramatic. When he escaped with Gabriel the were constantly hiding but once the get further and further from town the less it was like his home. This book had its strength and weakness. Its strengths was its description, how it is the first dystopian book, and how she ended the book. But its weakness was how boring it was and just the it doesn't excite my generation. I won't recommend this book too many people because it doesn't speak out to me, unless if you the love classic books. This book is part of a series and I do not plan on reading it."

"722",721,"Robert N.","The Giver, by Lois Lowry, lacks as much plot as it does color. It is critically acclaimed as one of the best books of it’s era, between the storyline, language, and characters. And I must agree, it does have great character development, as well as beautiful wording. But those are two of the only nice things I can say about this book. When they finally pull you out of the dark in Chapter 12, they seem to expect you to say “Oh wow, that’s very clever, now I understand.” rather than my reaction of “Wh- ….. B- ……. How Can-.....??”. I do understand the point Lois Lowry was trying to deliver with her book, I just think she could’ve delivered it better than with yet another “dystopian societies aren’t actually dystopian societies” type book."
"723",722,"TwitchyRedPen","The one star is of my own non-enjoyment, I get that other people love this book and I'm fine with that, just, augh. It is, to me, the poster-child for reading what your kids read and discussing it with them.We read this book when I was in 5th grade. I was ""a reader"" even then, not one to read one chapter a week, and raced ahead because it was interesting.And then I started desperately counting down to when we were moving out of the school district, charting against when the class was going to finish the book -- because I was a minority in my class/school, and kindof a weirdo, and I THOUGHT the moral of the story was that it was best to kill everyone who's different (and if you disagreed, well, best for you to go off and die in the snow, weirdo). I've been informed since that a) that is absolutely not the moral and b) he does not die -- but since we didn't talk about it in school (or if they did at the end, I was gone by then), and I didn't bring it up with anyone else (my later schools had not read it), I thought this for years.Moral of the story: Your kid who reads a lot might still be a bit thick, so talk about what e's reading, okay? "
"724",723,"sleeps9hours","I know this book got a lot of awards, and it was recommended to me, but I find it to be a shallow outline of a book.Spoilers ahead, so fair warning.I am a big fan of well-written science fiction and fantasy, and this book came nowhere near any of the classics of those genres (think Heinlein or Tolkien), which, with all the awards and hype, I sort of expected it to.That's a high bar though, and because there's so little great fiction I also read a lot of fairly crappily-written but possibly interesting youth fiction, like Hunger Games and Divergent.The Giver came out first, I know, the movie came out later and inspired all this recent interest. But the more recent dystopias were so much more detailed and thought-out. The first Hunger Games was great, it's not good writing, but the plot moved, the world was unique, and there was a message (the next two weren't as good, but worth finishing the story).Divergent I hated for a long time. I read them only to be able to talk to my 11-year-old daughter about them. I had a hard time with the initial premise of sorting people into factions (and again, bad writing), but at least the author spent a great deal of time laying out the society she created.Lowry is not only a poor writer, but she gives only the barest outlines of the society she wants us to envision. If her world weren't too different from ours that might not be a problem. But her bare sketch of a society is so against human nature that there is no suspension of disbelief (humans don't see color, they have no music, the landscape is completely flat and uniform, babies are born by a birthmother, given to a family that applied for them, then never see their parents after they become adults, all jobs are assigned at age 12, there are 50 jobs and each of 50 kids each year fits one of them, memories never die, if a memory-holder travels a certain physical distance his memories are absorbed by the populace he left, etc). Why, why, why, would any of this be the case? What is comes down to is Lowry had an idea of a lesson she wanted to share, and she wrapped it up in the thinnest outline of a story she could get away with. Nothing is fleshed out, all the characters are one-dimensional, there really is no suspense. At the end of the 2 hours it takes to read we're left with the idea that safety, consistency, and the bliss of ignorance are not worth sacrificing love, creativity, individualism, and transparency.These are nice messages, but ones that don't take some great leap of thought or insight. I honestly think that's why the book is popular. It's a feel-good message that's spoon fed and easily digested in a book that requires little time commitment."

Non è riuscito a farmi capire come fosse esattamente costruito questo mondo e perché. Insomma, un libro di una noia mortale...Tutto viene dato per scontato. Le persone non possono vedere i colori. Le persone non possono fare il lavoro che vogliono. Le Pulsioni vengono ""curate"". Sì, d'accordo, ma perché? Tutte queste spiegazioni vengono omesse, per quanto lo scorrere della lettura le faccia percepire necessarie. Si continua a leggere fino alla fine in attesa di una spiegazione che non arriverà mai.I personaggi sono abbastanza insignificanti. Non ho trovato spessore, approfondimento psicologico, che pure avrebbe potuto avere molto occasioni per essere presente. Non sono riuscita ad immedesimarmi in nessuno, a partecipare alle loro gioie/dolori.E soprattutto, Lois Lowry non ci spiega come avviene questo scambio tra Donatore e Accoglitore di Memorie, scambio al centro del romanzo. Il Donatore ha il compito di consegnare le memorie dimenticate/perdute dalla collettività all'Accoglitore. Uno scambio che è in odore di magia in un ambiente così razionale e che suscita inevitabilmente numerose domande. Mai soddisfatte.Insomma, da un libro per ragazzi mi aspettavo molto di più. "

"734",733,"Alex G","The theme of the book The Giver is to learn and experience things like happiness, sadness, starvation, beauty, and suffering which will change your identity, or the way you think. This story takes place in a community based in the future. Jonas is a 11 year old boy just like any of the other boys except for the fact that he is more intelligent, and curious. The giver is an old man who has been through many things, and has felt many emotions, more than anyone else in the community. When Jonas turns 12 he becomes the receiver he must receive all the givers memories good and bad. Jonas learns many things and has many questions.One negative is that some parts are hard to under stand, one positive is that it had a good theme, and was a page turner. I relate to Jonas because as I grow older I gain more responcabilties. One weakness is how it ends, it's not clear, and keeps you wondering. One strength is that it is well written. I would recommend this book to someone not looking for to much action, but more of a suttle book."

Jonas seemed to be a charming young man that was trying to find his way through his childhood until he was selected into what would be his job for the rest of his life. Jonas had a very interesting journey through his training as The Receiver of Memories. Through his training from The Giver, he experienced dreadful pain that only lasted a few minutes but seemed like hours to Jonas. I recommend this book to all readers. "

"746",745,"Ramona Terry","ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! I read this book bc everyone said it was THE original dystopian novel and I am a dystopia junky...but guess what it is NOT!!! If this were the first dystopia novel I'd ever read I would HATE HATE HATE the genre. Where to begin...there will be spoilers b/c I can't even attempt to discuss this without them. First of all this book explains NOTHING. We don't know how the characters ended up in this colorless sameness of a world...other than it was decided by someone for some reason very long ago. We don't know if the memories are about his world or ANY world. We don't know why Jonas was able to make this change that NO one before him ever had. We don't know ANYTHING. We don't know if it's related to the eye color. I mean the more I think about what is left unresolved I might as well just say the ENTIRE STORY was left unresolved. I can't even fathom what the movie looks like...smdh I didn't like a single aspect of this book...not one. The main character is not likable. He takes actions with no discussion of the consequences. I mean there is NOTHING positive I can say here. And I think the worst part is the ending. I mean we don't know if he did or didn't make it. We don't what happened to those left behind. WE truly know NOTHING. I mean even the ""elsewhere"" idea is absurd. These people have planes and all other types of technology but NO one ever thought to go looking for elsewhere until Jonas came along? they have other communities they can visit but still no one thought to ask questions and explore? AND how the heck did he just ride his bike away if he was so damned important? I am sure that one of the cars the Giver mentioned would have been available to go after him. I AM SO UTTERLY DISGUSTED with this book. I am also a little disappointed in the writing. It was a cool concept, giving the author ample opportunity to be creative and descriptive. You are a writer who repeatedly discusses the importance and power of language BUT make ZERO effort to illustrate the same. I mean if anyone could find a way to describe sunshine without using the word shouldn't it be an author??? I mean the possibilities were endless but you settle for warmth from the sky?!?! at least TRY....grrrrrrrrrrrrr let me just stop now before I give myself a stroke.My advice would be to NEVER read this book but if you do, the only positive thing I can say is - it was a quick read, finished it in a couple of hours, so you won't have to wait long for the disappointment.

"748",747,"Sue","I read this book because it was recommended by a friend. She said it was required reading for students. There is probably much to discuss about this utopian society, where feelings are stifled, there is no pain, each person has a job according to his/her abilities. I found it to be disturbing. It is written in a rather simplistic fashion -- i.e., the ""Giver"" is in charge of memories. I have no idea how this fits into a school curriculum."
"749",748,"Kevin Black","OK, I get it that the book was very skillfully composed, but ... seriously? This is a children's book? Honestly I cannot imagine anyone letting a child read this book, much less assigning it for required reading. Wait, I take it back, probably that would be the same English-major types who gave this the Newbery medal, the types who think that the message for every good book is ""life is painful, unfair and disappointing, and then you die."""

I felt really disappointed after reading it especially as the beginning of the book gave me high hopes.Admittedly I'm a sucker for good closure and mysteries of books being fully explained, which is where this book lacked. I felt like the end was rushed through because there was no realistic way of explaining the things in the book and it was left on a mysterious note which left me frustrated.I was left searching to see where the follow u books were as surely there must be a part 2 and 3, but it seems this really was the ending."

Who makes kids reading about killing babies because there is more than one born? And people being brainwashed and thinking that it is ""okay"". Huh. I like dystopians and post-apocalyptic reads. I really do. But this is kids reading these things, and they are forced to do it. I'm sorry, but you should only read it if you WANT to. And I definitely did not want to. Talk about shocking school kids. I understand everyone is different and takes things in other ways, but as an emotional person, and a kid, I couldn't take it. And what I don't understand is teachers making kids read this book. Maybe if I approached this book later on in my years, on my own, if i wanted to, it wouldn't be that bad. But sadly, I don't like the story line. I can't even read Matched. Seriously, I can't. I like dystopians, but for some reason *sarcastic* I can't figure out why I don't like this kind of story line."

Mercifully it's short, so I didn't throw it away, and managed to finish. I can think of several thousand plus page books that were easier to read, and less of a trudging mess than The Giver is.

"769",768,"Marla","If I'm completely honest, I didn't like this book much at all. I feel like Lowry's style lacks depth and detail and sometimes it seems she tries too hard to fit in her storyline. However, about halfway through when Jonas receives his ""assignment"" in the community, I really started to be drawn in. The ending, unfortunately, was so abstract and unclear, that I was back to my original opinion. When I finished the last page, I put the book down and just felt frustrated. "
"770",769,"__thatnewnew__","I thought that this book was poorly laid out and that it was hard to understand. In my opinion the book would be better if in the start the author would have given some background information on the community. For example, what planet they are on?, were did they get the memories?, did something happen on their planet that made them loose the memories? Also when Jonas left the community, where was he going?, what was he planning on doing when he got to somewhere else? All in all, I think this book was poorly written and explained. "
"771",770,"Rissa Tod","it was good writing and i'm not discouraging you to not read this but it gave me a few nightmares. one of the most depressing books i've ever read"
"772",771,"Henry Martin","Reading The Giver right after finishing Williams' Stoner was a mistake. Now that I'm done with it, I feel like I had just completed a satisfying meal complimented by a delicious dessert, only to reach for a glass, take a sip, and find out it has sea water in it. My palate is ruined. I must admit that, before writing this review, I looked at some of the reviews posted on Goodreads. I also must admit that either my literary tastes have been spoiled by past quality offerings, or that most of the [over one million] people who rated this book have no idea what quality fiction is. Whatever the real case might be, I feel sad. Where should I begin? Oh yes, at the beginning. The Giver lacks originality. Those who read widely will probably find elements from other books and stories, done and overdone ad nauseum. The premise of The Giver vaguely resembles the ideas put forth by Plato about 2500 years ago in his The Republic. The idea of a society where predetermined ideas replace choices for the greater benefit of an unknowing populace has also been explored in many utopian and dystopian books alike. Unlike the original proponents of such ideas, The Giver does not have a clear path to follow, as it dabbles in both utopia and dystopia without any clear direction. The entire book is composed of a fabric so full of holes, that an alert reader simply cannot take the information presented for granted. Instance after instance, the reader is offered a 'fact' which contradicts reason, yet the author either does not consider the reader intelligent enough to see this, or valuable enough to bother with an explanation. Simply put, the author asks the reader to suspend disbelief without providing the necessary path for this to occur. To me, this is both insulting and a sign of laziness. Let's assume, for a moment, that I was writing a novel, which takes place in a world where everyone walks. Suddenly, the protagonist takes off flying. As an author, I would have to create a backstory, a believable explanation why the protagonist has ability unique to him. Lowry, however, does not bother with explanations. Acts are presented as a matter of fact, despite their pertinence to the advancement of the plot, and there is no justification. The plot itself, if it can be called that, is rather shallow at best. Imagine, for a moment, a society where feelings are superficial, emotions are unnecessary, and a ruling body makes choices for the populace, which is unaware of the lack of reality, that ensure the smooth continuation of the utopia. Then, out of the blue, a boy with a power to see beyond (unexplained) is told that he was selected to carry the pain of memories for the entire community (again, no explanation why the regular citizens do not have memories, emotions, et cetera). The boy begins to receive memories, both painful and joyful, and mentions to his teacher that it would be better if all citizens had memories. The teacher agrees, but reasons that he has thought the same for ages, and could not find a way for it to happen. The teacher recalls an incident where an earlier apprentice quit and the memories transmitted to her escaped and entered the citizens. Suddenly, he and the boy realize that this is the way to enable the citizens to have memories, and they hatch a plan for the boy to escape the community so that, once he leaves, the memories he has will return and enter the population. Wow. Really? Ahem . . . boring. There are so many holes in this, and the author does not bother with any explanations. How are the memories contained within only one individual? How do the memories leave that individual and enter the population? How come the memories cannot leave the physical boundaries of the community but the individual can? Why does the 'giver' not leave himself do accomplish this? Why did it take him ages to figure this out? How come no one has done it before? Okay, what am I, an idiot? Thus, as a utopian/dystopian tale, this fails. Some, however, view this as a coming of age story, since Jonas (the protagonist) has an awakening and finds his consciousness. Again, I cannot view this work seriously as a coming of age story, because the awakening is mediocre at best, and the required character arc is lacking. Jonas might have had an awakening, but it was nothing groundbreaking. It was more like: Oh, I have a power. Oh, I'm learning things. Hey, my father has been lying to me! Okay, this should stop. I'm outta here before they kill the baby, which recently entered my life. The story had the potential to explore the disenchanted nature of the protagonist, the buildup and the excitement of discovering the truth, only to have the weight of the truth crush him. It had the potential to explore inner turmoil, the will to rise against injustice, deception, and the wrong rule. But it did not. It presented the tale in an arc that was rather flat. The plot and characters aside, I found the writing somewhat dull. It lacked on many levels. In conclusion, I must admit that I am, perhaps, more critical in my review than necessary. Nevertheless, in light of the countless glowing reviews posted on Goodreads by English Majors, educators, and readers, I feel it is my duty to be critical. When numerous books of higher literary merit are overlooked and virtually unknown, a book awarded the Newbery Medal should live up to the standards associated with that prestigious award. Looking back at it, I do not see why it was awarded. "

"776",775,"Jewel","read in 7th grade for school and i didn't enjoy it at all. I thought the ending was stupid because I could not tell if Jonas and Gaberial (was that the baby's name?) died or lived. I am sure that Lois Lowry is a good writer but this book made me not want to read any of her other books. I mean they killed babies in it because they only wanted a certain amount or something. I can't remember. But at least Jonas had the guts to stand up to his society and say ""Oh, Hell no! You are not killing this baby!"" Good for you Jonas. No one else thought that killing babies was wrong. Where are their morals? I just thought that it was stupid. No offense to anyone who liked this book (or to the author). Seriously, this is just my opinion of this book. And one more complaint. Why couldn't they see colors? That could have been explained in some way I'm sure. Also, I did not know that they could not see color until Jonas saw the apple or something and was all confused about what he saw. The only thing that I kind of liked about this book was that Jonas was brave. The idea for this book was interesting but it was way to confusing. The plot seemed rushed and sloppy in some places. *shakes head* The ending was so stupid! I do not want to have to decide for myself wether or not Jonas and the baby died. I would have liked this book a lot better if it was clear if they died or not. It grinds my gears. Honestly, I have no clue why we read this during school. I just wanted to ask my teacher ""Ummmmmmm, WHY?"" None of my friends enjoyed this book ethier. In fact, a few of them have gone of on rants about this book and still do. We are high schoolers now and the book has stuck with us this long but only because we dislike it so much. Frek man. I actually wanted to like this book. Buuuut I did not. My brother also read it and hates it with a passion (but then again, he's never really been one to actually LIKE reading. He only does it when he has to =P) UPDATE: I have been thinking about this book lately and I realize that part of the reason I disliked it was because I think that I was to young to have read it. If I had read it later I think that I would have appriciated it more. Also, the book has had an affect on me (bad but...) because I am still talking about it three years later sooooo yuuup. I just have been thinking about all the bad and mean reviews I have read and I really hope that no one is irked by my review. And I'm sorry if it does."
"777",776,"Tera","I didn't care for this book. I have a hard time with futuristic, science fiction types, an thaat is what this book reminded me of. It wasn't a very easy read, and I had a hard time getting through it. Jonas is a young boy living in a community that is set apart from the real world. He discovers there is a world beyond his own, and wants to be free of the life he lives. This book follows his ""escape"" into the real world, and how he choses to change his life."
"778",777,"David","It wasn't a bad book. Not a fantastic book, but enjoyable. Until the ending. The ending was arguably the worst ending I've ever read in my life. It made no sense, didn't draw the story to conclusion, and tied up zero loose ends. It was like the author didn't know how to finish the story, so when she reached her goal page count she just spend five minutes typing out whatever came to mind and said good enough. The sad part is that I was actually enjoying it to that point, and now think of the whole thing as a waste of time."

"780",779,"Ciera","The Giver had an interesting beginning. However, the writing style was choppy and the plot seemed rather stereotypical. It seemed to be a rather typical dystopian novel, just like all the rest. Furthermore, there was hardly any explanation as to some of the peculiar plot choices made about halfway through the novel, leaving several questions unanswered. I felt that such farfetched storyline pieces should have been ""over-explained"" for the reader to continue feeling the realm of believability, which, for me, was completely lost."

"799",798,"Katie","As Jonas is selected to become the Giver, his perfect world won't be perfect anymore. Yet his new world will be filled with color, and feelings, and memories. This book had a really good story, but the build-up was too long, so the actual important parts were too short, I couldn't see the depth of the relationship between Jonas and the Giver, and many things were left unexplained. Also, it made no sense to me that Jonas would just leave his beautiful community for Elsewhere, so willingly, and without a second thought. The book ended too soon, and needed to be explained more."
"800",799,"Christian Brandt","“The Giver” by Lois Lowry is a fast paced book. The book takes place in a utopia or perfect world. It is about a boy named Jonas who turns twelve and is assigned the role as a receiver. The receiver is the person who collects information of what life was like in the past before the utopia. 	One thing I disliked about the book is that it was kind of boring and unrealistic. I think other people could enjoy this but it just was disappointed. While reading I found myself daydreaming About other topics and not really paying any attention to the words on the book as I read. The Idea of taking an entire population and putting them into this perfect world was unrealistic. For example, an old man called the giver can put his hands on a kids back and transfer memories hundreds of years old to the boy. This is a Science Fiction but it supposed to be science not magic. I think the book is just to unbelievable and it was overall boring.	Another thing I disliked about this book it that it was way too fast. The characters never really developed enough before the climax. When I read a book the climax needs to come after the characters. It just seemed like she cared more about the plot development than the character development. Some people do however like to get to the punch but me I need it to be slow so I can watch it like a movie and learn about the characters so I can see what I like and dislike about them. For example, it kind of felt like there were only twenty people in the town even though I knew there was more. She needed to make more stories for the other people in the book. I feel like she cared about the main characters more than background people so she didn't write about them quite as much.	Overall I found this book to be okay because not all of it was bad but not all of it was good. I liked the story and the idea of a world like this but she went to fast for me to picture it. She needed to be more descriptive of the utopia so I could have a feel for what like is like there. Again the characters needed more elaboration so they could become more noticeable. I think I might check out some of her other books just to see if they are any better than this one. She seems like she could have better books than this one. I also gave this book a 1 and a half stars out of 5 but the author I will give about a 4 and a quarter because she is very good at other books."
"801",800,"Alisyn","This book is dark, disturbing, and disgusting (not in a physically violent or gross way, but in a ""why does this even need to be written as fiction??"" way). I wish I could unread this book. Not even the end could redeem the deeply disturbing subject matter and specific scenes of this book. SKIP IT!"
"802",801,"Cindy","I would not recommend this book for any teenage read. I think it would turn them off on reading with it's genocide of the imperfect, old, etc. Doesn't even have a good ending."
"803",802,"Isabela Peralta","I did not like this book because it is really strange and it did not taught me anything. Equality is correct until some point but I don't think it is correct to make people like in this book, like giving them pills for them not to have feelings and not having colors and this kind of things. In this book, characters are manipulated to be the persons that the community wants them to be and ""the giver"" is a person that is the only one who can see everything how it really is. Reading this book made me feel awkward and strange because it made me think of me living this book and I really would not like that they manipulated me to be however others want me to be so it also made me feel thankful for what I am and having the live I have, for being unique and being able to take my own decisions!"
"804",803,"Gabe Newman","I give this book 1/5 stars. It was hard to understand. i didn't get the plot. It seemed there was no suspense, no mystery, no fun. it was boring. The book is set in a society which is at first presented as a utopian society. The book is narrated by a 12 year old named Jonas. The society has eliminated pain and problems by enforcing to ""Sameness,"" over time. A plan that has also destroyed sadness from their lives. Jonas is selected to inherit the position of ""Receiver of Memory,"" the person who stores all the past memories of the time before Sameness. The more Jonas sees memories the more he wants the way the colony to change out of sameness.This book is like the last olympian because both are unrealistic. They both will never happen and are both fiction. the olympian is about greek gods still living. and the giver is about a utopian society."

"811",810,"Martha","Normally, I only write about books I actually like but The Giver leaves this reader confused that I can't move on. I'm not particularly excited about this book and I thought maybe I need to read the sequels to appreciate it fully. The main thing that pushed me to read The Giver is the fact that it won a Newberry medal so I thought it must be something. I also read good reviews about it (some even raving of the books ingenuity to teach children). There is a fourth book coming out too so I was fairly convinced I'd at least enjoy reading this even if it doesn't make it on top of my list. I mean, if there is a fourth book surely that means the first three that came out are good enough? As you can see, I gave it only a single star ... for good organization of a concept. I know for a fact it's not easy to write. But in general, this short book is a big let down for me.The story is kind of disturbing for a children's book. I'm not sure I want my nephews reading this until they're at least 16 or already understand what the holocaust was. By coincidence, I have been reading books that has a connection to the holocaust so maybe it's hard for me to process this without comparing. Granted, there is no mention of the event in the book but a reader is led into that conclusion. There is much discrimination in this book. The parents in this book are not actually biological parents, they are people who are chosen and expected to be able to raise children well. Actual birth mothers only give birth and after 3 or 4 times of doing so are sent to perform hard labor because they are not perceived to be able to raise children well or do ""more important jobs"". These women are looked down on by the community in general. There is also genocide in a way because they kill and dispose of babies that do not reach the community standards and they do the same process for adults too old to work or live on their own. So that is the conflict. But what about the resolution? I think the author used the part when the helpless newborn is disposed off for being the weaker version of the twins as the big turning point of the story. It is what made the protagonist decide to fight against the system but the presentation is actually weak. The main character's attempts and reasoning appear so half-hearted. Even the ending is weak. It closes to the protagonist catching (dying of) hypothermia and that might be a good ending for a book that has a sequel but the thing is, the second and third books were written so many years after the first one (it's like she wasn't sure she wanted to do so) and from what I gather, even though the books are related and grouped into a quartet (previously a trilogy), the sequels does not present a conclusion to the first one. Again, I would have to read the newer books to know but it may take a while before I find the interest to after this. "

I was really excited when I heard how good the book was and I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. I did actually read it really quickly, but I was beyond bored with the storyline. There really wasn't anything exciting in it. I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen, but soon enough the book ended and I had to sit on my bed and stare at the wall for a while thinking 'What the heck'. I've still to watch the movie. I can definitely say I will not continue the series as I predict it will be a great waste of time. "
"819",818,"Stephen Childers","It began with a good premise but fell short of developing the storyline or characters. There was so much potential yet the story ends without resolving any of the story threads. I recommend you skip this book. Maybe the movie will rewrite the story and make it interesting."

"825",824,"Elena","The Giver is a book by Lois Lowry it is a Futuristic. The book takes place in an unknown future year close to December. It is about a boy named Jonas who is now going to be an important part in the book and in the futuristic years to come, One thing I disliked about the book was it was kind of hard to follow and I didn’t like the rules and I think it was unfair for many people. I also didn’t understand the rules in the “Perfect World”. One thing that I liked was when Jonas saw the giver and discovered the things he is going to know. an article says that she wanted everyone to know her perfect world and then showed the reader how they would hate it."

"833",832,"Esteban V.","The giver was not that good of a book and it was boring in the middle of the book. The giver was boring because it was a confusing book and it was very hard to understand. What made The Giver boring was that it doesn’t tell you why they don’t have color, and they had tons of rules that they had to follow. I didn’t like how it was about the whole community not getting to do everything. I thought it would be a good book if they got to know everything when they got to a certain age. Also, the part in the book when they had to give the baby to “elsewhere” was really messed up because they thought that they were doing something good but they didn’t actually know that they were killing the baby and that made them “Murderers”. The only part of the book that i really liked was when jonas had to cross the memory barrier so that everyone could remember the memories that they had throughout their lives. "
"834",833,"Mason","This is a good book, I think it would be more intresting if the intresting part would come at the first few bits"
"835",834,"Asia young","My review on the book The Giver is that it wasn’t the most interesting book in the world but, it was readable. The main character is jonas, he’s eleven and he lives in a so-called perfect community. There is nothing negative like hunger or war, and everything is controlled by elders. Everybody acts the same in this community it seems like robots. Jonas eventually turns twelve and gets assigned a profession, the elders announce that jonas is a receiver of memory. The receiver of memory is a major title in his community, the person that he will work with and learn the ways of the receiver is an old man with light eyes. The only reason i describe his eyes is because only a handful of people have light eyes in his community, and jonas is one of them. while talking about light eyes jonas family has been taking care of an ill infant, that the elders say is not better within 2 years the baby will be released. If you don’t know what released is in this book it is, you will be sent out of the community if you are very old or ill and if you committed a crime/broke a law. So back to Jonas. A year into training learning from the giver who tells him stories about times when there was actual emotion in people. As he thinks about this community does and is about he becomes an enemy to the community. Jonas and the giver make up a plan to fake his death so he can see the difference how loving and colorful it is but also will find out about poverty and violence. Then he learns that his plan will not work because the baby that his family has been working with will be released the day he wants to start his plan, so on the day his plan was supposed to start he took his bike and the baby with him. after a couple of weeks of jonas with gabriel, mostly starving to death and facing a negative part of life. Couple of days later it starts to snow and jonas say that he sees a familiar mountain which he thinks is from a memory that his trainer told him and jonas thinking sledding down the other and their will be people on the other side to greet them. This is my summary to the giver. "
"836",835,"✽Laurenj426✽","I thought the Giver was a little bit creepy. I know it was supposed to be really ""deep"" or whatever but it just creeped me out. More than the other dystopian novels. I didn't like the Hunger Games but the Giver was weirder than that. Maybe I didn't like it because I had to read it for school years ago..."
"837",836,"Jenny","Most people love this book, but I personally found it disturbing. Funny thing is, I never got around to reading it until this summer (it became required reading after I got passed the grade level it was required for).

La premisa es interesante, una sociedad perfecta, todo controlado, limitado, organizado y solo 1 persona que recuerde todo lo malo, suena bien, por qué? nosotros nos quejamos siempre del desorden, pero sobre todo, DE NUESTRAS DIFERENCIAS con los demás, queremos que todos piensen igual que nosotros, les gusten las mismas cosas, y si no es así, pues el otro está mal y usted es un jeirel!! Lo anterior da como resultado un estilo de vida controlado y programado, que para ellos, que nunca han estado en nuestra realidad, está perfecto, es lo que conocen, sin embargo, para mi resulta TREMENDAMENTE ABURRIDO!Tiene muchas cosas que a uno lo dejan preguntandose muchas cosas, por ejemplo: la muerte, ellos tienen una percepción MUY DIFERENTE a lo que realmente es, digamos que para ellos, es un trámite, por ponerlo de una manera, por eso me sorprendió que fuese un libro para niños, por las interrogantes que plantea a nuestra sociedad. De igual forma me sorprendió que fuese como de lo 90´s.La pelicula saldrá pronto, no sé que es lo que pondrán porque realmente el libro es muy soso, flojo, una historia puramente lineal. Las preguntas que me hice realmente fueron un esfuerzo por no sentirme que esas horas las pasé en vano, había que buscarle la vuelta.No me gustó. No hice empatía con ninguno de los personajes. No lo recomendaría."

The book was about a boy named Jonas. His world is basically perfect. There's no war or suffering because everything is under control. When the boy turns 12, he gets an invitation from the Giver that wants to show him the truth. I honestly didn't like. It didn't grasp my attention at all. Frankly, I don't really know anyone my age who would like this book. It just had a little too much of talking and no action. It was very unbalanced. I got confused in various times of the book. Just didn't describe or tell the story very well. On the other hand ,I think this would be an excellent book for my mother or grandmother. They like these type of books. A little mystery but the book was not my thing. I think they would enjoy this though, anyone can if they like these types of books. I just didn't like it in my opinion "

"857",856,"Gabe Ruvinsky"," ""The Giver"" by Lois Lowry is not a very good book. This book deals with a young boy named Jonas who is selected for an important job in a utopiant community, the Receiver-of-Memory. This is a community that went to sameness so Jonas will receive the memories from a current Receiver. These memories are memories from before this community and the rest of the world went to sameness. This book is set in the far future and slightly sci-fi. I would not recomed this to a friend."

"860",859,"Caleb B","The Giver By: Lois Lowry For me I did not like the book. I like to read books that I can relate to. Not scy-fyish not real books. Also I had a hard time understanding it. The main setting was in a dystopia(i think) in the past. The main character in the book was Jonas who had a major conflict with the way the community was. A sameness community. Where everyone acts the asact same way. And he hated that. I would not recomend this book to anyone. I hated it. But if I had to, I would recimend it to freaks because its a freaky book."
"861",860,"Naina Mishra","The worst book of all time is The Giver for many reasons. Firstly, I could not relate to it in any way because I am not 12, don’t live in a town full of control freaks and would under no circumstances share my dreams with my parents. Secondly, the book frustrated me from the very first page. Sometimes, I felt like jumping into the book and screaming at the guy who made the “rules” of the town. In The Giver, you are not allowed to fall in love, which is ridiculous. You are “assigned” your wife or husband. Neither are you allowed to dress the way you want or buy the toys you want. They also KILL extra children and annoying old people which shows that the leader of the town does not have a heart. Thirdly, I did not like the way the author wrote the book. I wished that he had made it longer and explained the story more because I was confused 100% of the time. I still do not understand how you can “transfer dreams.” I never would have read this book in the first place, but my RLA teacher and my parents forced me to. The only thing I liked in this story was the ending when Jonas finally left his controlling town and went to earth. I wanted to scream at Jonah: “Finally! You finally got some sense! It took you 12 years of your life to figure out your town SUCKS!” Overall, I HATED this book so much I could shred it into a billion trillion pieces with my own hands. WORST BOOK EVER!"

"864",863,"Sierra","This book goes right in with Among the Hidden. I got this book because last year one of my friends in the advanced reading class read it sounded interesting. Wrong! A waste of money, this book was so over hyped, and really screwed up. Jonas the main character is chosen to be a Receiver who aka is becomes The Giver. Straight to point, the Receiver is chosen to hold all these f***ed up memories of the places all over the world, wars, ponds and all that jazz. OH! Yeah, in this town there's no color and certain words (example straight from the book!) Love. And they use the word released real loosely as a word for in some cases killing themselves in others just dying. I don't get why it gets an award?

It was in my school curriculum three different years in a row, and possibly a fourth year if memory serves me right. While it does have its merits, the book is not complex enough to actually merit retreading the same ground over and over. If I only read it once, I probably would have liked it, but wouldn't consider it among my favorites. I think the book's message is right for its time but not really as poignant today.

"877",876,"Jaki","This book was utter tripe. That is the only way I can describe it. The first third to half of the book is so boring and utilitarian that I had to force myself to continue, and that was only done because so many people said this was an amazing book and I thought it must get better. For a while it did, the middle of the story was interesting with the transfer of memories and Jonas experiencing all sorts of new things. Then you get towards the end of the book, which not only seems extremely rushed, but feels like the author had no idea what to do and so just slapped something together on the spot. I would definitely not recommend this book to anyway and actually persuade people to take it off their reading lists if it is there. Don't waste your time. While it is a short book and doesn't take long to read, seriously you will have many other better books on your list that you will actually like a whole lot better. "

"880",879,"Lax","To be perfectly honest, the book just drags. It lacks any sort of real plot until the last twenty pages or so, where all of the actual action of the book happens. All of the pages before that are expository - just laying the base of the story for those last few pages. It's an interesting idea of dystopia and certainly original, but it was difficult to stay focused on the story; I was more interested in the fates of some of the characters who were mentioned in passing. Overall, I'd say as an dystopian story, it's worth the read, but not something you would want to purchase."
"881",880,"Desi"," I did not like this book at all. I don't like the utopian society that is portrayed here. It's terrible. There is no real time frame or location for this story. I just had a hard time wrapping my head around this story. "
"882",881,"Morgan Sontag","Never in all of my life have I hated a book as much as this. There's only a few books I hate, this is definetly one of them. I read this in 9th grade, it was an assignment. I read it before everyone else and I hoped that there would be a light at the end of the tunnel. There wasn't. 100% crap. The writing was poor, the dimesions of the characters were poor, the plot had amazing potential but it didn't deliver. I wanted he and his brother to live. I wanted things to change but nothing happened. It just ended. I was expecting so much more. "
"883",882,"Terrion Wilburn","This book wasn't very interesting. It has too many scenarios that we wouldn't exactly experience in everyday life. I honestly feel that the author tried to hard to make the reader be left in suspense when really it should have just gone straight to the point. If you were to ask me if this were a good book I would chuckle and walk away. I feel that this book was mediocre and should be burned by anyone who owns it. It was trash, I HIGHLY suggest you not read this."
"884",883,"Kendra","Back when I first read this book, I gave it one star...I don't know if I would change that, but I have thought about this book many times since I read it a few years ago. To me, this book seems somewhat prophetic. It's like ""1984"" or something...a little unnerving for me! ;)"
"885",884,"Regina Bennett","The concept was very interesting...I won't spoil it for you...if you like a finite ending, where all ends are tied up and you aren't left thinking about anything, then don't start this book.

Or if you are especially fond of making your own decisions, whether they are good or bad, no matter what other people think. As a matter of a fact, if you think it would be a good idea to make laws that prevent people from doing what's wrong, you definitely should read this book."
"886",885,"Maria","not at all what i was expecting. I feel like the authur could have done soooooo much more with this book. I wish that Jonas would have questioned his family unit more, and started a little caios in that perfect and freakish world of his.

"887",886,"AC","It turns out that I realized that this was a children's book, midway through the book. Anyway, I finished it. The first half of the book is thoughtful and innovative. But the author seems to have been in a hurry to finish the book and it completely shows in the second half of the book. The language has been oversimplified and lacks any real luster. In fact, sometimes the author's thoughts seemed ridiculous to me, and I was left imagining as to what exactly the author thinks of her readers????All in all, a very poorly written book. Certainly undeserving of the rating its got on goodreads.Molding the young minds better rest on strong shoulders, on someone like Sir William Golding."

And then it ended just when it could have gotten to something good. I felt awful after I finished reading it, as if the book had somehow taken something from me- and I don't mean just my time.

But what something I did find interesting in this book is how someone could go back into dreams or like go into dreams in a short amount of time.Even though this was not one of my favorite books I still had a lot of fun reading it and trying really hard to try to catch up with what things were going on in the book. Once I got caught up and all it went pretty smoothly but then I really could not keep up that much with my class in reading the book so I just at times read what i could and try to at least figure it out.Sometimes, I wonder if I actually really really should of put my best inst rest in this book.

"901",900,"Callum","The Hunger Games wasn't the sole dynamo in young adult literature's surge of condensed, humdrum dystopic fiction. The Giver, although it had less of an impact, was for some strange reason considered important enough to be taught to students. This novel was a blank parable, lazy and just as shallow as its setting. Its portrayal of a society, which attempts to stray away from emotions or anything internally painful or uncontrollable is simplistic to say the least, it divulges the cons of such a society in the sleaziest and the most one-sided manner. The Giver completely detracts from the challenging, mature or complex elements which the best dystopian novels would provide.The author tries to conform the sense of utopia as being a disillusioned sense of unison among people and the preordained nature of almost everything that happens. This includes the birthing of children, the jobs that kids will do in the future. Lowry painfully describes how the birthing process in her world must go about and how everything is incredibly strict. The jobs are assigned, but that would make it seem more like a dystopia wouldn't it? Wouldn't common knowledge protest that in an instant? I do not believe a mass indoctrination could impune what common sense could have easily told them. Perhaps it's fear, but it's never specified so the logic behind the monotonous citizens is as blurred as the novel's seemingly slippery logic.Lowry tries to write poetically at times. Throughout, her prose is standard fair. Almost like a stilted attempt at a straightforward prose that really comes off as more tedious to get through. For a short novel, it took me a ridiculously long amount of time at trying to go through it. Its ideas of dystopia weren't scary, or intrinsically compelling. The basis for this dystopia is of abstract surrealism; it never confides in anything real or honest.What irked me most about The Giver was the ""chosen one"" motif. In a common dystopia novel, the individual ultimately did something that caused their grievances or significance. It was earned through subversion, not arbitrary convenience. So in that, Jonas is a dull character who is special merely because the story needed a special character.The Giver, a character of wisdom and intrigue doesn't go any further than his esoteric demeanour. He is the only character who experiences the emotions that every other person is devoid of and yet remains just as insipid as any of them. His character is a looking-glass to the past for Jonas, yet the wisdom he bestows him doesn't do anything unpredictable for the story. It demonizes one human nature to glorify another, ultimately dehumanizing the story. His actions, as monotone as he, do not resonate or remedy the pseudo-horrors that Lewis Lowry tries to convey. His sequences are just an entropy of everything terrible and wonderful about emotion. Emotion as black and white as an Oreo. Lowry doesn't seem to realize that the emotion she portrays isn't just a two-sided phenomenon. I noticed a plot hole here. Why would they let anybody with such power and emotion be able to witness such atrocities? And not only that, but someone of such control and power (the power of every citizen's emotion) could easily rebel to the Community's barbarity. More enquiries arise as Lowry adds more and more exposition to her story. She only adds elements of surprise to have us hate her dystopia, shock value that's more likely to have us shuddering than inducing thoughts. I'm rather happy that Lowry avoided the concept of rebellious conflict. It has been done so many times, but so has the concept of hidden barbarity. Many find the killing of unwanted babies to be a powerful and an effective use of contrivance when in reality, there are far worse crimes to humanity. I don't say that without regarding the act of infanticide as absolutely horrifying but if this is considered a dystopian future among readers, the past had Paleolithic cultures. One of the earliest thriving colonies of man who killed 50% of female newborns through neglect. Or the Carthaginian’s atonement to the gods, by sacrificing thousands of infants. Let's not forget about the scrutiny of the Spartan's exposure of such infants, through a judgement dictated by elders on whether the infants were deemed desirable. This method of shock is very exploitative to the children reading it, not informative and not thought-provoking. If it was a retelling of history, it wasn't nearly as effective either. It was a means to demonize the practices that this pseudo-utopian society indulged in in the most biased method possible.Aside the setting's concept or the prose, Lowry writes a really flat story. Not at all did I feel this was a story worth telling. What she was trying to tell us was something, although not obvious, but too one-sided to be effective. Her display of contrived culture-shock mixed with despot sensationalism is simple, it won't offer anything a good ole' history book should be able to provide alone. She portrays emotion as being black and white, her political structure as decidedly unlikable and her lead character as young and undefined so that she could give the readers a relate-to feel for her mundane story.

"902",901,"Ashley Waisanen","The GiverBy: Lois LowryI personally didn't like the book. It really wasn't the type of book, so that's my reason. The setting was in the future. Jonas and The Giver. Was with killing the babies and Jonas and The Giver wanted to change the ways of the community. I didn't like it but if you like that type of stuff than you should read it, so if you like that kind of stuff than read it and if you don't than don't read it. it's a good read but I just didn't like it."
"904",903,"Maggie Sullivan","I wasn't a big fan of this book. The beginning is VERY SLOW!!!! I found myself often looking back and answering my questions a few chapters back. The book is very short, and it should be longer, because it would be nice is Lois found a way to tie things together. because I'm a lazy reader, so I don't want to figure things out for myself. Just kidding, but it would be nice if she would do that. I think it would make the plot seem more interesting, because the whole book was, ""I did this. Then I did this, and it made me sad."" So typical for a first-person book, but really. Mix it up a bit. This book needs a twist, LEGIT characters, relatible characters, some funny parts, some surprising parts, some INTERESTING parts. Basically, this book had a somewhat interesting plot, but done horribly wrong."
"905",904,"محمد مخلوف","Boring novel"
"906",905,"Charles","The storyline just didn't sit well with me - it was kind of moralistic but without any real sense or depth. Kind of immature sci-fi."
"907",906,"Darlene","I hated this book when I read it in middle school. It's so bizarre. "
"908",907,"Noelle","This book had the weirdest ending!!! i was sor of dissapointed... but the plot was almost interesting."
"909",908,"Jess"," this book was not my favorite it was at times confusing. i would say this is not for teenagers. i dont think i would re-read this book, there was some boring parts to it."
"910",909,"Tan August","I just don't get the appeal of this book. It's a hard story for young adults and the payoff just really isn't there. I would say its maybe a high literature level than something like the Hunger Games yet I still see so much more value in the Hunger Games. I don't think this really teaches anyone anything profound or really even that interesting. It always confused me that it was included in required reading lists for school. I think its definitely a misfire and not worth the time investment."
"911",910,"Jo Fletcher","I know this booked is supposedly written for children, I just hope children are smart enough to see through the propaganda,"
"912",911,"Susy","is this really suitable for children? was on a reading list for 10 year olds... starts out fine - well-written and paced, but [SPOILER ALERT], since when is euthanasia a good topic for such young children? interesting book, but hardly a ""must read"", nor is it ""great literature"". if you like this, you might like Never Let Me Go... I didn't. "
"913",912,"Emily","it sucked"
