"4",3,"AGC","Amazing book. Funny, interesting, intellectual, yet understandable. With the amount of interesting adventures and hobbies Feynman mastered during his life up to that point, it makes me wonder if professors actually do any work. But of course they do!Richard Feynman, physicist, professor, Manhattan Project-er, Nobel laureate, amongst many other prestigious titles, writes about his many shenanigans as he grew up that did not stop even until his professional adulthood. He portrays his sense of wonder, persistence (which is why he mastered so many things like cracking safes, painting, and playing the drums), and humor throughout the whole book as we get a glimpse inside the mind of one of the greatest scientists in human history.Just read it."
"5",4,"Penney Kolb","*smile*"
"9",8,"Graham Mumm","Amazing tales and insights from one of the greatest minds of the 20th century. Feynman is so down to earth, you can't help but admire his lifestyle and philosophy on everything he interacts with. A must read."
"11",10,"Vinci","What an incredible joy to read this book! His enthusiasm, humour, and curiousity jumps out vividly from the pages as if Feynman himself were telling you his story. I loved every chapter of it. "
"16",15,"Shirley","A classic. One of the first (auto)biographies I ever read (from my dad's book shelf), which may explain my ongoing fascination with Richard Feynman. "
"20",19,"Andrea ","Reading this book really feels like I'm having beers with Feynman himself. "
"21",20,"GC","I have to say, he is one of my favorite authors and probably one of my favorite thinkers. I like the way that his brain works and the way his mouth conveys thoughts directly. "
"23",22,"Toma","This is one of the best books that I've read lately. It's incredible to see how a Physics Nobel Prize Winner had such a curiosity and tried everything, from playing drums to painting. Funny & lots of life lessons to take away."
"25",24,"Richter","Loved this book. It´s an easy read and still full of insights. Feynman is pretty amazing, definitely recommended for everyone not just readers with interest in Physics."
"31",30,"Chrissy","This was one of those consistently solid books that built up to an even solider ending, so solid that it deserved a sustained slow clap, if only the author were still around to hear it.Feynman as a narrator is hilarious, intelligent, mischievous, adventurous, and-- perhaps most importantly-- honest. I get the strong impression that these are traits that would have described him as a human being, an artist, a scientist, a friend, and a musician as well. No matter what he tackled, he seemed to approach it with the same humble confidence, the same commitment to truth and discovery, the same self-deprecating nonchalance. From lock-picking to fluid physics, he was afraid neither of pretending that he knew more than he did, nor of admitting that he didn't know as much as he pretended. His devotion to inquisitiveness, to trying and questioning everything, led to a remarkably unique and influential life. An inspiration to scientists everywhere.I recently finished a biography of Paul Erdos which talked about Stanislaw Ulam's contributions at Los Alamos, and it was fascinating to tie it together with insight on the project from Feynman's perspective. All these phenomenally interesting minds! In one place! At one time! Knowing that such minds exist even today (as yet undiscovered, even!) gives me an eager anticipation for all the collaborations, explorations, and conversations I can look forward to as I move ahead in my field. The last chapter particularly spoke to me, as a student of psychology-- which Feynman describes, in his 1974 address, as ""cargo cult science"". I feel like I learned more about myself as a scientist than I did about Feynman in reading this book. And I learned a hell of a lot about Feynman. "
"35",34,"Sandy","Hilarious and fun to read!"
"36",35,"Ann Lepore","Both funny and informative. Feynman is a physicist who worked on the Manhattam project and won the Nobel Prize for his important contributions to quantum mechanics. The book contains various incidents from his life--tragic, interesting, and amusing."
"37",36,"Lori Pulichino","What a great life lived!! Can you imagine being in this physics class???? It would have been AMAZING! Great stories from a man who truly found the live in his work"
"39",38,"Mitch","First memoir read here, really really good likely because Richard Feynman is an easily idoliazble character. Loved Leighton's transcription decisions, did evoke a sense that Feynman was orating these stories, a favorite chapter/story: Meeeeeeeeeee! (might be the best titling, too, and the whole thing's title was fitting, as I'm sure they thought).Found the bits of math tricks and science wisdom delicious trivia, like to get the squares near 50 you subtract 100x the difference of the number from 50 squared and then add double the difference to that.Found Feynman's exploration of art wonderful and inspirational, brought back the drawing exercise of not looking at what you were drawing which I've heard before.His dabbling in music, both Brazil and drums, delighted as well. His attitude toward things like that inspires, right. He exploited pretention and laziness nicely, and he admits his mistakes too.Feynman is incredibly lucky at points, which might or might not be true, but makes a good story, so I was on the look-out for ""makes a good story"" twists, biases.Chapter notes:He Fixes Radios By Thinking!: Inventing his own math symbols and realizing it wasn't great for communicating to others. String Beans: Innovation is a very difficult thing in the real world, at least for him as a kid surrounded by adults. He read the Life of Leonardo.Who Stole the Door?: deaf&dumb dance anecdote, Latin or Italian?: Made me think of Life Is BeautifulAlways Trying to Escape: Fun experiment with dreaming, lucid dreaming, and the teacher's Charlie Brownish droning :)Meeeeeeeeeee!: Hypnotism recounting.A Map of the Cat: Why do you memorize muscles, or bunches of things you can look up?Mindreaders: Or, how they work.The Amateur Scientist: Nice anecdote with ants, ending with a way to get rid of ants humanely.Testing Bloodhounds: An investigation into the powers of human smell.Los Alamos from Below: Fun with censors, other issues with military bureaucracy, meeting Bohr (has the wonderful skill illustrated in Monster Minds), saw the bomb through truck windshield because UV light hurts, not brightness.Safecracker Meets Safecracker: Self explanatory.Uncle Same Does Not Want You: Psychological deficiency is good if the army's involved, sort of.The Dignified Professor: Brilliant ideas is, if people expect something of you, it's on them, not you, if you don't live up to it. You have no responsibility to their expectations. Playing with the plate led to his Nobel stuff, and he was playing for no reason!!!Any Questions?: ""Get out of my way, or I'll pee right through ya!""You Just Ask Them?: On disrespecting womenLucky Numbers: Number tricks!O Americano, Outra Vez!: Delightful story of frigideira playing, good distinction between science and not science, on memorizing definitions and encouraging experimentation (good for other fields too).An Offer You Must Refuse: On avoiding difficult decisions.Would You Solve the Dirac Equation?: Appreciating culture, not avoiding it (stay in the Japanese hotel!), Military phrasebooks are probably rude, Pais says publicity is a whore, Japanese has polite versions of verbs.The 7 Percent Solution: Try everything for yourself, be skeptical or don't listen to the experts.But Is It Art?: Good for a reread.Is Electricity Fire?: Dangers of interdisciplinary conventions, hate of pompous foolsJudging Books By Their Covers: Science, math textbooks get it mostly right, but aren't very good usually.Alfred Nobel's Other Mistake: It's the things nobody knows anything about that we can discuss: weather, social problems, psychology, international finance, and international relations, as added by the Japanese ambassador. Japan values education a lot.Bringing Culture to Physics: Mayan math!Found Out In Paris: Drumming, Ukonu, percussion ballet!Altered States: hallucinations, sensory deprivation tanks, resource for those things.Glad I spent some time with him, he also has videos explaining stuff in YouTube, like this one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1pIYI5JQLEMakes me smile to see that after I spent time with him."
"42",41,"Jonathan Sancho","you don't analyze such sunlit perfection,you sit back and just bask in its warm and splendor inexorably delightful!!!"
"44",43,"pierre menard","To say I enjoyed this book is an understatement: I reread it endlessly growing up, and it is one of the few books that ended up shaping me as a human book. Feynman's stories are an ode to rule-breaking, original thought, cleverness, and the general pleasure of being a gadfly. Beneath it all, you can sense the feeling of wonder Feynman has for the universe and its laws. This is the book I'd give to any science-minded adolescent. "
"51",50,"Devangana Khokhar","Undisputedly the best book I have read so far! If you are a avid reader and haven't read this book, then you haven't read anything at all! Having heard about Dr. Feynman from my friends so many times, I was curious to know why all of them were such big fans of him and this book gave me all the answers. The book is so well-written that you feel that you have been part of Feynman's life somewhere sometime. The concluding paragraph was icing on the cake - ""So I have just one wish for you – the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.” "
"55",54,"Cwilson","Excellent read! Don't worry if you aren't into physics, this book is all about simplicity. Feynman will trance you with his wild ways, so you will surly enjoy."
"63",62,"Sierdjan Westen","This book is awesome. Extremely intelligent, funny, well written and above all: a shining example of what being unique can bring you."
"66",65,"Judy","I put this aside after reading only a few chapters. He seemed to be so enamored with his abilities, and his bragging turned me off. However, I eventually went back to finish it and I am so glad that I did. I enjoyed it tremendously. Maybe my attitude toward him changed or maybe as he got older (it is sort of chronological), it didn't seem that he was bragging as much as sharing with the reader what he knew and how he went about learning about almost everything! It would have been most interesting to have known him. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know a little about a lot, written by someone who knew a lot about a lot!"
"68",67,"Andre","Super easy and fun read from a genius mind!"
"69",68,"Elizabeth Atwood","What a guy Feynman was! He showed in innate genius at a young age that persisted throughout his life. Just the few things I really admire about him...instead of going on sabbatical he completeley switched disciplines from physics to biology and actually did some pretty interesting experiments! He was incredibly clever and managed to crack several safes with some of the most top secret information about the Los Alamos project and the atomic bomb-which he worked on. He taught in Brazil, played in a Samba band at Carnival, then upon leaving the University at which he taught gave a talk about the fact that the Brazilian higher education system was basically a joke and that students were only memorizing a bunch of things and never actually LEARNING anything! He went from being completely inept at drawing to actually selling portraits, which totally blows my mind because most people would say ""well I can't draw, that's it"". When he won the Nobel Prize, he didn't even want it! This book is packed with these fabulous anecdotes about this intelligent, witty, clever, innovative genius physicist. My favorite part of the book is the last few pages where he talks about scientific integrity. He says, ""If you've made up your mind to test a theory, or you want to explain some idea, you should always decide to publish it whatever way it comes out. If we only publish results of a certain kind, we can make the argument look good. We must publish BOTH kinds of results"". When I looked him up on Wikipedia I found that he developed two rare forms of cancer, Liposarcoma and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, dying shortly after a final attempt at surgery for the former on February 15, 1988, aged 69. His last recorded words are noted as ""I'd hate to die twice. It's so boring."""
"74",73,"Eoin Flynn","This book is simply a reprint some of the material from the wonderful ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"".For anyone who's read that book - I wouldn't bother reading this one. There's very little new material in it and it's less detailed.Despite that, it is still a fantastic read. For anyone who hasn't read The Pleasure of Finding Things Out then pick this book up and get reading!As a scientist, I can tell you that Richard Feynman's Horizon episode from 1981 - from the transcripts of which, much of this book is taken - is one the main reasons I became a research scientist. I've watched it a million times. This book is the written form of that. It's a perfect description of what it really is to know something. Of how to accurately determine something - not just in science but in everyday life. It also serves as guide to not succumbing to the many and varied pitfalls of poor thinking. It is a very human account of a man who, even to other great scientists, seemed god-like in his intellect, how that man and that intellect came to be and how oddly achievable it seems (though of course you know it can never be for us mere mortals).From a more shallow perspective, this book is a series of witty anecdotes about a scientific genius of the 20th century that anyone can enjoy. "
"81",80,"Tom Schulte","Narrator Raymond Todd really launches into this classic work with gusto, making it my favorite edition of this oft-published work. Combined with these stories appearing in his lectures and other anthologies, many of these tales are like old friends. I delight in hearing of his pranksterism and insight and anti-establishment behavior. From Los Alamos a-bomb research to university academia to the Nobel prize, there is a lot of arc to the professional side of his life. From his wife's death in the 40s to bar girls and bathroom bar fights, there is a lot of not-much-held-back personal life, too. Some of my favorite parts are his exploration of his potential in percussion and drawing as well as taking an objective, scientific approach to picking up bar girls and understanding the ways of a professional gambler. Also high on my list is his experiments in John C. Lilly's sensory deprivation tank. Something that still rings true is his rant against ""Cargo Cult Science"", even if there are doubts his quoted rat experiment medical research and even softer sciences like psychology.Why am I always irascible after reading Feynman?"
"82",81,"Priya","Thoroughly enjoyed this book!"
"85",84,"Marie Drakes","A magnificent exploration of the breadth of this man's curiosity. Life affirming, education boosting, reality questioning, wonderful. "
"88",87,"Olga","I still can't believe how funny this book is considering it's written by a physicist. The anecdotes are one of a kind and you actually learn a few things along the way. "
"89",88,"Negativni","Richard Feynman u ovoj knjizi ne piše o kvantnoj elektrodinamici, polju u kojemu je dao najveći doprinos fizici. Ovo su, kako i sam podnaslov kaže Adventures of a Curious Character, avanture znatiželjnog/neobičnog lika. Feynman ovdje piše o nekim njemu najzanimljivijim događajima iz života koji su zabavni za ispričati. O tome kako se, već kao mali, počeo interesirati kako stvari funkcioniraju. Počeo je s rastavljanjem jednog radio prijemnika, a uskoro postao majstor za njih za cijelo susjedstvo. Feynman je sudjelovao i u razvoju atomske bombe, dok je istovremeno pokušavao provaliti u sef jednog od vojnih zapovjednika - ne zato da bi nešto ukrao iz sefa, nego samo zato, jer su mu rekli da je taj sef nemoguće obiti. Taj dio je i jedan od najzanimljivijih u knjizi. Samo od toga bi se mogla napraviti dobra komedija.Mnoge stvari su ga zanimale, pa čak i kako mravi komuniciraju i kako znaju pravi put do hrane i da li se može istovremeno govoriti i brojati u sebi. Feynman je svirao i bongo bubnjeve. Bavio se i slikarstvom. I uz sve to dobio Nobelovu nagradu za fiziku. Knjiga je stvarno užitak za čitanje, ima puno zanimljivih situacija i humora. Nevjerovatno je da je to sve jedan čovjek uspio proživjeti! Rijetko je koji fizičar-teoretičar imao tako uzbudljiv život. Feynman također piše otvoreno i iskreno, pa se, uz zabavu, može saznati i nešto o samom čovjeku, njegovom karakteru, pa i o njegovim manama. Nakon čitanja knjige čini mi se da sam barem malo i upoznao samog Richarda Feynmana. Barem onako, iz viđenja."
"93",92,"Anshul Thakur","‘Surely You’re Joking Mr. Feynman’ are the memoirs of Richard Phillips Feynman, a very interesting man and incidentally a noble laureate in Physics. Ralph Leighton collected these narrations over a span of seven years when the two drummed together. It is hard to believe that a single man can do so much in a lifetime as Feynman did. These are his experiences with the world in general seen from the perspective of a very curious and scientific pair of eyes, told in just the same flamboyant and uninhibited manner which is the hallmark of Richard Feynman. Feynman talks about his journey from repairing radios in his childhood to MIT and Princeton days, to working on the atomic bomb, gambling in Vegas, learning to play music and paint to the point of being famous, visiting strip joints in America and beaches of Brazil, and what not. One cannot help but wonder, how audacious a faker could he be? Could it be possible that he has been faking all along (as far as the book is concerned)?Read Full review at Aesthetic Blasphemy and do drop in a comment to let me know what you think. :)"
"102",101,"Stella Maris","I was never a big fan of biographies, or autobiographies for that matter but Mr Feynman definitely changed that. He has a way of telling some short chapters of his life that brings the reader into that time of his history, feeling like an old friend of the physicist. Not only that, but the content of the book will also wake on the reader some weird ideas! I at least couldn't resist trying to find which object my friends had just touched just by smelling their hands and then the objects in the room! It's simply fantastic, to know a little bit of the world through the mind of a simple but highly intelligent fellow. Certainly I'd have liked to be Feynman's pupil."
"111",110,"Lore","I've had a lot of fun reading this book.It's been my first contact with Mr. Feynman and I can say now that I'm a big fan. Rarely I've seen an individual with his desire to learn new things and explore everything for himself. It's a reminder that life can be so interesting if you keep an open mind, a curious disposition and give everything that you can in all that you do. "
"116",115,"Jordan","Thought I hated biographies before this book."
"117",116,"Jack","Delightful! From the wonderful rascal physicist. Best chapter title? could be ""Alfred Nobel`s Other Mistake."" (I guess dynamite would be the first one). Feynman apparently thought the Nobel Prize itself was a joke, though he himself won that prize for physics. This collection of marvelous stories gives insight into the intellectual independence and curiousity that could be considered a hallmark of great scientists such as this one."
"123",122,"Lucas","After having read this book it feels like you got to know Richard P. Feynman. And I think he has written some interesting thouhgts in this book. However, most of the book is about how he did quite some amazing stuff(Science, drawing, going in bars and more) and how he felt doing it."
"124",123,"Snorre Lothar von Gohren Edwin","Awsome book, and its really fun to hear about his life and the contrasts he had as a physics professor and what he did!"
"126",125,"Vignesh","An interesting read which can completely change your perception on scientists. What a man and what an inspiring life! Who said nerds are boring? P. S. Couldn't help relating him to Rancho (sans the friendship part) from 5 point someone."
"130",129,"MariaK","This is the first book I read about Feynman, which made me want to read everything written by him and about him. Great book, highly recommended to everyone, whether you have a physics background or not."
"131",130,"Paloma Meir","I think so highly of Richard Feynman, and love this book. It's written in a light conversational-style. Strangely, it had the feel of a self-published book. I'm sure if he were still alive, he would be ruling self-publishing world, putting out a few books a year. The man was definitely an overachiever.I wrote a rather long-winded post about him and the book on my blog. It's a little too rambley for Goodreads. Click over if you feel like reading it. You've been warned...http://palomameir.com/2015/10/07/sure..."

"135",134,"Liliane","Articulate, funny and kind."
"138",137,"Irena","A wonderful book. Richard P. Feynman is a scientific genius, Nobel Prize winner in physics, a genius of mischief and an owner of insatiably curious mind -- this makes for the funniest and thought provoking book at the same time. You don't have to know anything about physics to enjoy this book."
"139",138,"Jean-Luc","Feynman is so brilliant that a book about one of America's top physicists doesn't ask the reader to know anything about science beforehand."
"141",140,"Adam McNamara","The book starts slow, but it quickly becomes apparent how rich a life Richard Feynman lead. His tendency to seek new experiences is inspiring. He reminds me very much of Bill Murray."
"142",141,"D.B.","Scientist are funny. No really! We are!"
"143",142,"Marissa","Feynman lived such a big and diverse life. It is fun to get a glimpse inside his very hilarious and brilliant mind."
"144",143,"Artem Huletski","Невероятно остроумные истории от выдающегося человека. Эпиграфом я бы выбрал слова Стейнбека:""Есть, как видно, три вещи, которым никто не верит.

"146",145,"Raymenstein Torque","if some one asks me what is the title of the book you most enjoyed my answer is definitly 'surely you're jocking, Mr Feynman'"
"151",150,"Marty Babits","Richard Feynman is an amazing person. He personifies fearless intellectual curiosity, creative ingenuity and an emotional openness .His intolerance for pretentiousness and willingness to find simple, direct solutions to complex problems are delivered in a writing style that is clear and accessible. Inspiring but also first rate entertainment. Tip: catch him on YouTube speaking himself. He's joyful and adventurous. Perhaps as important a twentieth-century figure as all, maybe including Einstein. Father of nanotechnology among many other accomplishments."
"155",154,"Bobby","Egocentric even for a compilation of memoirs. Nonetheless, Feynman has convinced me that he was indeed a badass."
"159",158,"Kidd","Great book! Love Mr Feynman"
"160",159,"Manmohan Dash","A marvelous book you can read just over the weekend. I purchased this one from University library many many years ago, around 2004. This and other Feynman books are much less expensive and describes the curious character of the most talked about scientist of the last century who is considered in the top-10 list of all times as a scientist. Here he spans the book with marvelous humor and personalized anecdotes. His wit, character and intellectual as well as scientific honesty had made him the eye-candy of every scientist and geeks world-wide. His life was the most studied and most criticized. It does not leave him below any criteria although you will occassionally see misinformed and overzelous people making unfounded remarks about his mental inclination. Befiting of a worldly genius. "

His anecdotes are all entertaining, many are informative. I was not aware he worked on the bomb, his stories revolving around his time in Los Alamos were among my favorites. His ability to pick any problem apart and think about it logically is pretty inspiring. Recommend this book to anyone, people should be reading books like this by amazing people instead of self help books by dubious authors with the wrong intentions."

"174",173,"Vishal","How much do you think a person can do in a single lifetime despite having a dedicated attachment to the ever-demanding(and boring, according to laypeople) field of Theoretical Physics?He can learn to make good enough paintings to be shown in an one-man exhibition. He can learn to play Bongo well enough to be included in street competition in pre-carnival seasons in a city of Brazil. He can play drums for a Ballet which would win a national level award. He can learn to crack safes and pick locks which would give him a reputation all over his work arena. He can make reliable observations and conclusions by practicing hallucination, analyzing dreams by falling in and out of sleep, by making an experiment on ants and showing their lack of sense of geometry. He can learn many languages. He can get drunk every now and then in bars and pick up girls. He can stop drinking at once when he wishes to. Despite all of this, he can still win a Nobel Prize.Richard Feynman, the coolest Physicist ever, shows you the vast array of possibilities to consider and explore if you begin with a child-like curiousity about the world and don't let it fade away with passing years of your life. Before reading this book, I was little apprehensive about what I am supposed to do in life if I like so many things and am afraid to pick up one because I don't want losing my other fields of interest. So one of the greatest teachers, Feynman, showed me the way that if you remain curious and manage your time, you can pursue whatever you want.This book of anecdotes might seem a little exaggerating and annoying to some people, who altogether miss the idea of the lessons the author is trying to propagate. One of the reviews on Goodreads says that, the book is full of arrogance and how Feynman is showing off his skills at so many things and taking pride in himself. I pity the poor reviewer who missed the point that how Feynman is not showing that ""I could do it"", he is showing that ""it can be done by you too"". So much rant for the ignorant laypeople.Inspite of the anecdotes about Feynman ""having fun"", the most important parts of this book to be circulated and popularized are his views on pseudo-science and scientific integrity. He experimented with much of pseudo-science including psychics, hallucinations and dream-interpretations and explained the scientific side of those phenomena. He explained how ignorant people are fooled by the practitioners of pseudo-science. About his remarks on scientific integrity, it is a must read for anyone who wishes to pursue science, and it should be read by laypeople too so that they could see how science works and why is it preferable to any cult of faith believe system. He explains the importance of experiments and shows you to be patient with them in the part about his experiments on ants.""You are not obliged to be what others expect you ought to be. If you don't be what they want you to be, it's a failing of their judgement, not your own."" A quote that could be misinterpreted too, but it would be clear when one knows the context in which Feynman said those words. After the death of his first wife and returning from the Nuclear bomb project, he was depressed and had a sense of loss of his zeal for Physics. He was teaching Physics but he didn't think he was making enough contribution to research according to what was expected of him. That's when he explains how he stopped caring and started to play with Science for the love of it. He started with a trivial experiment of analyzing spinning plates and this lead to the ideas in Quantam Physics which later won him the Nobel Prize. The story of recovering is impressive and inspiring, if my elaborations here don't make a convincing case for it then I suggest you to take my word for it and read the part.In conclusion, this is one of the books which you can include in your list of 'Life-changing books'. You can read it again and again, everytime you'll learn something new. Everytime the book will offer a new perspective onto life. Everytime, you'll see how to live a life that is full of Life. "

"186",185,"Jason Goodman","Did this via audiobook and hated the narrator, but absolutely loved the stories."
"189",188,"Whorlwind","I read this book (actually listened to it on audiobook) while going through an uncertain time in my life, where I was searching for meaning. Feynman was a great inspiration to go back and learn to play with life, and to challenge myself to understand more about everything. I am in university now working towards a research scientist degree, as a non-traditional (i.e. OLD) student, in no small part because of the inspiration I received from this and several other Feynman books and lectures. If you read the stories as Feynman being alone in being exceptionally talented in everything, then I'm sure he does sound annoying. If, however, you consider that most everyone has some degree of talents such as these that they just don't bother pursuing, I think you may find that, like me, you can get inspiration here to do more with your life."

These are truly the adventures ofa curious character which will have you laughing very hard indeed. BTW, I bought his lectures on physics which explained some principles to me, sad to say, for the very first time: this man had a grasp of the very simplicity of the universe along with its immense complexity. The amazing part was that he treated them exactly the same.This is the guy who brought down the liars at NASA and Morton-Thiokol over the Challenger disaster by submerging an O-ring in a glass of ice water and then breaking it in half in front of a television camera, proving that it became brittle when cold.

If not, then there's no way I could even begin to explain to you why you should read it.The book itself is a collection of anecdotes as told by Feynman over the years, transcribed by Ralph Leighton. Therefore it reads like a night out in the pub with your friends, but in a more organized and sober way.By reading this book you won't get much insight into how scientists are as people, because Feynman is a truly unique character. But it gives you fleeting epiphanies, because by reading this biography you will come to understand that which makes scientists tick is science itself. And this theory of mine is best expressed by a Feynman quote that you won't find in this book: 
""Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself. The principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.""
 Of course, any such theory should be not taken at face value, but put under the test. 
""Because if it disagrees with experiment, it's wrong!""
 -- I'm paraphrasing Feynman here."
"240",239,"Simon Driscoll","I recently re-read the autobiography, 'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!' I first read this book in high school, and was fascinated by his stories of his work on the atomic bomb. Since that time, I've achieved my Bachelor's degree in Physics, and it makes me laugh even more. Whether you're a theoretical physicist or a brick layer, or anything in between, this book is full of insightful humor, only some of which is caused by a Physicist's unique way of looking at the world and not understanding the social requirements of certain situations.The title comes from the response of a very British woman asking if he would like milk or lemon in his tea. He asks for both. Anyone who has mixed milk and lemon juice knows it would ruin whatever tea it was added to. Who wants to drink curdled milk?Feynman's insights in the book range from his experience cracking safes to cutting layers of red tape and why, as well as a passionate call for a return to pure science. This section at the end had a greater impact on me now than it did in High School, all the more because it hasn't been heeded in the intervening decades. I echo Feyman's call for true science to make a resurgence. When science is held at the mercy of the businesses who fund it, the businesses can pick and choose the results they want, thus destroying the validity of the study altogether. If you run an experiment 100 times, you will probably find one run that indicates the opposite of the other 99.This is a fun and interesting read, no matter what level you have at understanding Physics."
"244",243,"Brendon Schrodinger","
“Would you like cream or lemon in your tea, Mr. Feynman?” It’s Mrs. Eisenhart, pouring tea.“I’ll have both, thank you,” I say, still looking for where I’m going to sit, when suddenly I hear “Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. Surely you’re joking, Mr. Feynman.”
The title of this collection comes from a tale that took place early in Feynman's career where he was invited for an afternoon tea with the dean of his university. The dean's wife is serving and asks him the above question. Richard never drinks tea and never moves in the same society that does, little own the society that has lemon OR cream with it. A big theme of these stories and indeed a running theme in Feynman's life is that he had no time for formalisms, rituals or societal views. He does attribute a lot of this to his upbringing. His father was a uniform maker and often dealt with clients of all types of notoriety and he knew that underneath all those uniforms were just another naked ape. He passed on his views to his children and Richard went so far as to nearly not accept his Nobel Prize. To him it was another form of bullshit and that his reward had already been awarded with other scientists using his findings.It's no argument that Feynman was a brilliant physicist, but he also had many interests. And a great proportion of these stories are about these interests or how his interests intersected with his physics work. There is only one story in this collection that is technical in any way. The collection reads as if you had somehow run into Feynman in a seedy bar in 1960s Vegas (there's a story about this time) waiting for a showgirl to finish work. He is a great orator and the origins of these stories are that they were recorded and transcribed by Ralph Leighton, a drumming pal of Richard's. Yes, Feynman played the bongos. So while you have this brilliant man, in some ways ahead of his time in the ways that he thought and how he acted, there ares some hints that he is a man of his time. Reading these stories you come to realise that Feynman was quite the womaniser. He appreciated the female form in a socially acceptable way for the time that he lived in. And so when someone from the twenty-first century reads this book he can come across as a bit sleazy. I am not going to defend his attitudes nor am I going to condone them. Personally I found nothing overtly offensive about his actions or his attitudes. But I can imagine my partner reading this and sighing at several statements made by him. The book covers times in his childhood right up until late in life. There is a nice large chapter on his time at Los Alamos working on the Manhattan Project. There are also stories about his time in Brazil and Japan and his love for immersing himself in a different way of life. There are also a couple of great chapters on education; one about the standard of students he sees while in Brazil and the other concerning a time when he was asked to be on a panel to decide high school texts for his school region. I'd recommend this read to most people. It is extremely accessible, with little jargon or technical physics. It talks more on his philosophy of living, learning and how to deal with the world around you. He is definitely a great orator and that is why his legacy lives on. This book remains a popular seller in the general sciences and recordings of his lectures and interviews are popular on youtube. It's great to know that we still have so much of him around.And for those who want more there are plenty more collections of his wisdom. There is also Feynman a biographic graphic novel."
"246",245,"Kevin Price","So far as I read further through this book it becomes more apparent that the author does not want to think of this book at a biography but a funny way of denoting Feynman's accomplishments through out life whether small or large and young or old. It has a witty demeanor to it and lets the reader think more into the information presented in the book than what is actually there."

I normally don`t read through an autobiography or a biography, but this book is the exception. This is the book which will teach you to not give a damn about whether there are other people around you, and to laugh out loud. Seriously, I have not laughed so much and so frequently than the ""Mr Gum"" series, which is a book still unparalleled with its laughter- inductiveness capabilities. But Mr. Feynman comes a close second.  I have no way to guarantee this, but I swear that while yur read this book, you`ll add Richard Feynman to the list of dead people you wish you had met at least once, or start a list with him in it."
"271",270,"Yusuf","Feynman's autobiography is a funny and insightful journey through the life of one of the greatest minds of our times. Feynman was an extremely witty man in real life, and his humour carries over into the book. He's not afraid to make fun of himself, but at no point does he sell himself short. For anyone interesting in studying physics (like me) Feynman's journey through schooling and his brief descriptions of the works that made him so famous are just priceless. His love for physics really shines through everything he did, and it just makes me want to hit the books and learn everything. "

"281",280,"Vismay","Possessing an excessively curious mind, Richard Feynman has tried out almost everything under the sun. He is the one guy, I can say confidently, who has lived a full life, without any regrets. He has repaired radios and hosted radio talk shows; tried to introduce ground-breaking innovation in kitchen appliances; harassed waitresses; spoke fake Italian; interpreted dreams by trying to observe them closely; worked as a chemist in an electroplating company; blew up glass carboys while attempting unsuccessful experiments; took a biology course; validated mathematical theories by simply forming a mental picture and gut instinct; worked as a mechanical engineer in Army; broke locks; assisted in making the first nuclear bomb; chased girls ; holds the patent for nuclear airplane, nuclear reactor and nuclear rocket; played  frigideira  in Brazilian Carnaval; played poker with other people's money; took drugs and alcohol only to abandon it later; lived like a Japanese; rocked theoretical physics; made portraits of (many)live nude models; argued with Rabbis; fought a losing battle over the deteriorating standards of school textbooks; tried refusing the Nobel Prize; deciphered Mayan Hieroglyphics; played bongos; got people to induce in his mind hallucination......This book has inspired me to do whatever I ever wanted to do so that the day I die, I end up with, practically, no regrets! Feynman was a fully rounded personality, never bound by social conventions in his lifelong pursuit of always satiating his unbridled curiosity!I dare you to do more!!! "

"288",287,"Páll  Gudmundsson","What a fun book! What a funny character this guy must have been. Winning the Nobel prise in physics as well as winning a samba competition in Brazil!! Surely note many that have achieved that! not to mention cracking safes and learning from scratch to draw and paint so well as being able to sell drawings... and playing bongo drums for a San Francisco ballet!!I recently read a book called ""The hundred year old man who climbed out of the window and disappeared"" by Jonas Jonasson. It's a wonderful adventure about a guy who meets all kind of interesting people and even gets on the Manhattan project and helps building the atom bomb. A bit unlikely of course, but then again it is a novel. But Feynman does all that and that is a true story. I got the feeling that Jonas Jonasson got the idea for his hundred year old guy from reading about Feynman. "
"290",289,"Chunyang Ding","A very down to earth and inspirational book, this book is a must read for anyone who hopes to go into the field of modern physics. Richard Feynman was one of the largest figures in the development of modern physics through the 20th century. However, his success was not only in the academic world, but also in the adventures he sought out and his particular way of thinking about problems. Through this cleverly written autobiography, he exposes his truly human way of tackling problems, leaving the reader amazed at his wit and skill. Even if you don't wish to go into the field, it is a remarkably amusing book filled with anecdotes that will keep you giggling."

Besides he was also a winner of nobel prize in theoretical physics and was part of building the first atomic bomb. I wonder how do you squeeze so much into one person??????? But that is how magicians are made. This books cannot be described in mere words....it was an experience.

"310",309,"Margaret Volks","I have had the pleasure to be smitten by people of Feynman's character type & generally have left their presence drooling with admiration and a certain sort of blessed reassurance that there is sanity in this crazy world.This book is not one I would characterize as an ""easy read"" especially if you don't have a basic & general background in all of the sciences. I consider myself to have a basic background and while grasping most of the stories & quips involving Feynman's fascination with biological concepts, I pretty much got glassy eyed when stumbling through quantum theory, theroms and what have you.Nevertheless, this book is very entertaining and gives insight into the workings of a man of enormous curiosity , intelligence and whit.It is written in short chapters , each one could be read as a separate story all of which are rich with adventure, sound scientific thinking and humor.I think every student from 5th grade through college level should be encouraged to read this book as it is a great lesson in how science is a process of sound thinking, logical reasoning, debate and discussion, success and failure.Pick this one up. It is an exceptional insight into a brilliant mind, an interesting character and some background on his & other's contribution to our own American history. The book is written in Feynman's voice and will leave you feeling as if you knew him and begging for the chance to go back in time and have a cup of tea with him."

The book is very funny and I would recommend it to anyone who likes funny non fiction books. "
"318",317,"Momchil","There are many reasons why Richard Feynman is one of the most loved scientific figures. Never mind the importance of his discoveries - he was a great person, which is revealed throughout this book (which has practically nothing to do with science, by the way). The stories are usually entertaining and show his mischievous, fun-loving, girl-loving, music-loving... life-loving side. Beyond that, one catches a glimpse of his genius, and of what it means to be a scientist in the purest sense of the word: to always put truth first, and in that respect to never be affected by popular opinion, authority, or one's own personal prejudices. Great read about a great man that's the role model of most physicists (including yours truly). "

Feynman himself is a biography about his life before he was known for his work with quantum mechanics as a theoretical physicist. The novel is hilarious and had my attention from the very beginning to the very end. The novel highlights some of the times where Mr Feynman used his intelligence to solve problems throughout his life. One of my favourites parts of the novel is when he learns how to crack codes and locks. It was extremely interesting to see how he did it and the science behind how locks work. I recommend this book to anyone who has a sense of humour and loves science. This novel is a easy 5/5."

"350",349,"Muthuprakash Ravindran","http://sibipranav.blogspot.in/2014/07...During school days, one of my favorite subjects is Physics. For various reasons, not to mention some of the best teachers I've had, it has remained a favorite subject ever since. I still remember reading books on relativity, QED etc without understanding a single word in the entire book. The Soviet publications on elementary Physics were cheap and easily available. It was just that I have had to read a lot more on basics before even attempting reading one those big volumes. That's when I came across NBT's introduction to basics of Physics series. Thus, a journey into a fascinating world started.At some point, my interest moved from physics to the physicists. They were no less interesting than the subject itself. Especially the physicists from the period 1910-30, when giant strides were made in Quantum mechanics / Astronomy / Particle physics etc. The leading physicists of this period starting with Einstein, Bohr, Dirac, Oppenheimer, Pauli, Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Fermi, Born were fascinating by themselves. Each of their biographies is much more interesting and the eccentricities of them and their days are interesting reads by themselves.Richard Feynman comes into this list a little later than all these giants. He grew up in the 1930's depression era New York and studies physics. His semi-Auto biography 'Surely You're joking, Mr.Feynman' is actually a fascinating collection of anecdotes from his life and few of his lectures on education etc. The eccentricity of the genius is what makes the whole thing interesting and the inner workings of the life towards the research he does is as fascinating as the man himself. But the book is not about physics or about the physicist itself. It is about a very interesting person who goes through a lot of crazy situations in life and comes out of it always laughing. While re-reading it recently, I was wondering whether it is possible to convert the adventures into bedtime stories for the kids.It is a long time habit of mine to tell stories to the kids before they go to sleep. Now that Sibi has grown up and Vanathy knows more stories than me, I do not do it often. But there are days the kids want to hear a story and we usually take turns to tell stories to each other. Its fun and there is nothing that makes going to bed more interesting.So I tried to start the experiment by first breaking up the story into incidents that can be made into little bed time story capsules. Following is the list bed time stories I could make out of the book.1. He Fixes radios by Thinking2. Who stole the door?3. The deaf and dumb ball4. Latin or Italian - Vanathy loved this5. The Chief Chemist6. The Princeton episode 7. The first visit to Brazil - Learning Portuguese8. Los Alamos - Adventures9. Safecracker Feynman10. Second visit to Brazil - Carnival episode11. Nobel laureate 12. Painter FeynmanEach of these episodes will not run beyond 5-10 minutes in narrating and makes for a fantastic story in each itself. After the second one, the kids were hooked and Vanathy started asking for 'more Feynman stories'. 'Still Life' - FeynmanWhen I read this book first in March 1999 (I happen to mark the books with dates and place I bought them), I threw open the door to a person whom I've admired for his curiosity and for not taking life too seriously. It also showed that not all scientists are dour and the fascinating life of Feynman makes it fascinating. What I told the kids is that if they can get through life with that same kind of curiosity and 'live life in full' then there is nothing more they will want. There are many morals that are inherent in each of these stories that are hugely relevant to today's students if only we care to tell it or ask them to read the same. A great book that still surprises me and more importantly gives me joy every time I read it. This time the joy multiplied through the kids. "
"356",355,"Titas (Emperor)","Physics is like sex!Today we will talk about a scientist who was an extraordinary man, known as a teacher, lover, master safe cracker (who stole papers of Manhattan Project), fan of Las Vegas’s strip clubs, exceptional liar, musician, artist and probably the most brilliant, influential, and iconoclastic figure in his field in the post-World War II era.How does one define a role model? A prodigy, hard-worker, achiever, winner in the field one is interested in, right? Well in that case the Nobel Prize winner theoretical Physicist Richard P. Feynman is a perfect candidate as role model to physicists. He was dangerously smart and an exceptional teacher. But underneath everything we generally know about him as a scientist, he had a curios and alarmingly mischievous mind that knew no boundaries.First let me just mention some of his works:During World War II Feynman was recruited to serve as a staff member of the U.S. atomic bomb project at Princeton University (1941-42). He was co-awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work. Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology.Enough with the facts already! Now lets talk about the wisdom he left behind!While stealing papers of Nuclear bombing, you should leave mysterious clues: Feynman was a master of desk wiping, lock picking and safe cracking. He even used to think about the mentality and psychology of the safe owner to crack faster. He once cracked three safes of Manhattan project and left certain clues as a mysterious mastermind. Why? Oh just for the fun of course!If you have to lie, lie with full confidence: It doesn’t matter if what you are saying is absolute truth or not. Even if you are unsure, don’t show it. Just go through it in full throttle judging the situation. Example- Feynman once got on stage and recited a jibrish with just the few words he knew in a foreign language. When one doubtfully asked if it was wrong, he replied that the man didn’t understand the depth of the recital!If you’re in Vegas and short in money, act as drunk friends of the strippers: I don’t even have the courage and experience to explain this one.Love what you do and do what you love: In his own words- “Physics is like sex: sure it may give some practical result, but that’s not why we do it.”Know yourself, find where you belong and embrace your faults: “I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.”“That’s the trouble with not being in your own field: You don’t take it seriously.”“All the time you’re saying to yourself, ‘I could do that, but I won’t,’–which is just another way of saying that you can’t.”And most important of all- don’t lie to yourself: “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”Even after being a dashing lover and romantic husband, Feynman was a phenomenal teacher (yes, this man was everything one wishes to be). His series of books 
The Feynman Lectures on Physics
 is perhaps the most popular physics book ever written which Nature described the book as having “simplicity, beauty, unity … presented with enthusiasm and insight”.Although he had experimented with LSD and Marijuana just because he was curious about the effects, he was was a damn fine fellow when it came to the meaning and purpose of life. To him the purpose was knowledge as he had described, “I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there.”A boy who knew how radios work, a student who invented his own mathematical symbols for better understanding, an undergraduate who stole a door, the only scientist who watched Atom Bomb test (Trinity test) without wearing glasses, and the only scientist ever who had asked a reporter if he can refuse the Nobel Prize because he didn’t like to answer too many phone calls – Mr. Feynman had lived a life that we live in 4 or 5 lives summed up together. Why? For the glory of knowledge of course! He was an unique personality beyond rules and paths.Thus like many many other students of physics, if I’m asked about my role model, it is none other than R. P. Feynman- a man who understood very very early that one should focus on understanding instead of just knowing things. Reading about all his life and life’s works one wonders what an honour it would have been to see him once face to face. The man who must have been the only one to appear in the world of Physics with such energy and brilliance.Read this semi-autobiographic book to experience something like never before.In his precious word, a person should live a life 
“where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.”

"365",364,"Zhi Han","A classic book by the famous theoretical physicist. Real-life adventures in the technical field and life lessons. Recommend for technical people."
"366",365,"Dr.J.G.","This is one of the few books written by the physicist - one of the most brilliant persons of our time - for everyone. It is not only readable, and enjoyable, it is even lovable, and a must for anyone who is even remotely interested in anything interesting. When he was on the manhattan project he learned about locks and was able to pick most locks without much of tools, and in fact took out number locks easily. As a result they took action - not to make themselves safer, which was his intention in demonstrating his skill, but in passing a memo to the effect that he should not be allowed near anything locked! Feynman had a brilliance that shone in whichever direction his conciousness turned, and this is manifest in this book in more than one way - that the book is brilliant would be an understatement, and that it was by a brilliant man equally so. He writes about all he did and tried to do, and one can see how well he did how much. He is finally able after many years to write about what affected him deeply with hurt, the loss of his first love and first wife at a very young age. They married knowing she was dying shortly. It is a moving episode, and one sympathises with his silence about it, with his dealing with it till he came to terms with it emotionally. One respects him for not jumping into another relationship with a hurry, a boomrang action most ordinary males not only take but are in fact actively encouraged to do so in almost every society. Feynman did not cheat on anyone who was even a one night stand, in that there was no pretense and no sleaze. With the radiant persona that was him, that would have been out of the question."
"367",366,"Denabler","A replica of a supreme detective could be seen in Feynman. You might think it is absurd, but think what a detective does, he uses the know facts on clues and gets the case closed. I am a fan of really good detectives, and their arch rivals too. His experiments whether with ants or with call-girls were all the same. He came out as a learned man with new facts. I envy him, and adore him and I know him only by his book. He had truly opened up his heart and told every little thing that he had experienced. Being a bright student and smart individual is not related to how monetarily successful they are, but how rich they are intelectually. If you want to know someone who intellectual, dare devil, curious, scientific, hilarious, careless, lives the life for what it is, then READ THIS BOOK."
"369",368,"Alvaro Silva","I just knew of the existence of Professor Feynman about one year ago. When I was a child and then a teenager, I used to read the biographies of some of the finest minds in the world. In that way I met Newton, Leibnitz, Einstein and others who by now I can not remember their names. Those books always gave me the impression that those scientists were depicted as semi-gods, as apostles of the science, almost as saints, only virtues, no defects or mundane stuff. But it wasn't until recently that I started to look for biographies which could give a more human point of view of the lives of those people. I started my search looking for womanizer scientists or drunken scientists or very sociable scientists, people far away from the stereotype of the scientist. I found Richard Feynman and he captivated me. Even I found in the web a picture of Richard Feynman sitting on a table of a topless bar chatting with one of the girls of the place.http://electricspacekoolaid.tumblr.co...The things I can conclude after reading his book of anecdotes is that he was a very passionate man, he liked his physics and his girls, he gave a try to almost everything, sketching, playing bongos, biology, etc. He was a man who didn't fear to fail, to make mistakes (that is very important for me) and who didn't fear to challenge the authority. He did things in a playful way, only for the pleasure of doing them. He was a man always willing to share his knowledge and with the skill to explain things in plain English to the layman. In sum, a very charismatic and approachable character."

Совсем нет! Просто эта книга навела меня на мысли о том, насколько же важно иметь свое Дело в жизни. Каждый самостоятельно отвечает на вопрос собственного существования, но, бесспорно, бесконечная любовь к конкретной созидательной деятельности делает жизнь несравнимо более осмысленной. С этой точки зрения я получала особое наслаждение от чтения (ведь, к сожалению, в повседневной жизни таких примеров не слишком много). Фейнман беззаветно любит физику, и, хотя речи конкретно о физике в этой автобиографии не так уж много, именно она, как мне кажется, придает ему сил. Живой ум и интерес к решению разнообразных задач приводит его в массу интереснейших ситуаций, описанных в этой книге. А чувство юмора и позитивный настрой делают эти рассказы невероятно смешными и увлекательными! :)Рекомендую абсолютно всем!"

I'll never make that mistake again, reading the experts' opinions. Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that's the end of you.
I can usually tell when I’m going to give a book 5 stars by one sign: I can’t shut up about it. Well, I couldn’t and can’t shut up about this book; it was simply great. This greatness sort of snuck up on me. I’d recently read a collection of anecdotes by a scientist (A Primate’s Memoir) and found it rather disappointing; plus, the whole idea of reading a book of stories about a great physicist, without learning any actual physics, seemed silly. But my skepticism had withered away by the end of the first chapter; I was entranced by the man, absolutely fascinated, and remained so the whole time.The subtitle of this book is perfect, because the two meanings of the word “curious” converge to encapsulate Feynman: he was curious in the sense of being odd, as well as curious in his love of learning. I was trying to figure out a way to describe Feynman’s personality, and this is the best I’ve come up with: Feynman is Huck Finn grown up to become a physicist. The qualities that make Mark Twain’s most famous character so endearing are also the qualities that endear Feynman to me: mischievousness, curiosity, cleverness, honesty, naiveté, friendliness, frankness, and an uncompromising moral principle. Like Huck, Feynman is always getting himself into absurd situations, and getting out of them with pure quickness of mind; like Huck, Feynman likes to fool other people and play tricks, but all without a hint of malice; and like Huck, Feynman will stick his neck out for what he feels is right.There are some hilarious stories in here, which I won’t spoil. But what was more impressive to me, was the amount of serious thought that could be found. Feynman’s criticism of the Brazilian school system—which relied overmuch on memorization by rote, and concentrated overmuch on passing tests, instead of teaching students how to make sense of the world around them—applies equally well to many aspects of the current U.S. school system. Equally relevant was Feynman’s chapter on the time he served on the board that oversaw the evaluation of math textbooks for the California school system; it was a Kafkaesque farce. But by far the most consistent intellectual theme that went through these reflections was an absolute distrust of pretension, reputation, convention, snobbery, prestige, and authority.In my own life, one of the most interesting, and also most difficult, lessons that I’ve had to learn is that people are not nearly as competent as they’d like you to believe. When I was a kid, I had a lot of faith in all sorts of things. I thought that if an ‘expert’ said something, it must be true; I assumed that there was a particular ‘expert’ in every type of activity, be it business or science, to ensure that things ran the way they were supposed to. In short, I had the comforting illusion that very smart people in very white lab coats were behind the scenes, ensuring that things ran smoothly. The world certainly cooperated with this illusion for a while (after all, that’s the whole basis of advertising); but it wasn’t long after meeting people in the ‘real world’ that this illusion imploded: the world is run by people underqualified and overconfident.I include this bit about myself because I don’t think I would have reacted so emotionally to this rather lighthearted book were it not that I had that experience. In a way, a distrust of all authority is Feynman’s central social message. He is constantly running into ‘experts’ who haven’t the slightest idea what they’re talking about. He goes to academic conferences full of pretentious windbags; he trusts the results of other people’s experiments, and later finds that they were seriously flawed.So any time somebody makes a claim, he decides to test it out for himself; and the few times he doesn’t do this, he gets into trouble. This realization, that most people are inclined to trust claims from authority, is integral to his almost supernatural ability to navigate unfamiliar situations; Feynman is so easily able to bluff his way through because people take his word for things. So this central insight—to always check for youself—is both the heart of his scientific attitude, as well as his way of effortlessly gliding through the world. His ability to crack safes, for example, wasn’t due to his knowing a lot about safes, but simply realizing that most people used their safes foolishly, not resetting the factory combination or setting it to something obvious. Most of us assume that we couldn’t figure out how to crack a safe; but Feynman did what he always did, and saw for himself whether he could: and he could!I honestly wish that this book was three times its length. Now, I must know more about Feynman. My favorite saints are the ones who would hate to be worshiped, and Feynman certainly would think this glowing review was nonsense. Well, perhaps it is; but the only way you’ll know for sure is by reading this book, and checking for yourself."
"397",396,"Russell","Amazing guy. I realised that's already read it but I'd forgotten loads of it, eg. Art/drawing, reviewing maths books for schools (What's the total temperature of the red,blue,green, red and violet stars? Aargh!)"
"398",397,"Dorota","One of the best books I have ever read, smart and funny."
"399",398,"Gonçalo Salgado","A lot of highlightening, so it was a excellent book!Ele diz: «Feynman, isso é muito interessante, mas que importância tem? Porque está a fazer isso?»«Ah!», digo eu. «Não tem absolutamente nenhuma importância. Faço-o apenas para me divertir.» ........«Os diagramas e todo o assunto que me fizeram ganhar o Prémio Nobel originaram-se nesse meu entretenimento com o prato oscilante.»"
"400",399,"Giovanni Calabro","This was highly entertaining. Very funny and Feynman is as humorous as he is brilliant. "
"401",400,"Harker US Library","Readers unfamiliar with Richard Feynman might envision a scholarly, soberly theoretical physicist scratching away on a blackboard full of formulas so complex that only he and, perhaps, Einstein can understand them. However, after finishing Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!, readers discover a radically different side of the Nobel prize winner. Whether Feynman is breaking into Los Alamos safes, drumming in an amateur band as part of Brazil’s annual carnival, or having the time of his life in a Las Vegas strip club, he remains fantastically dynamic. Throughout, the language in the autobiography is rather simple, yet one hears a truly genuine voice behind the words. In my opinion, this is a must-read, even for non-physics fans, since it traces the story of a genius in such a non-conventional, exciting way. – Agata S.’15"

"415",414,"Ali Khan","A great insight into the creativity of Feynman's mind. His writing is simple yet engaging. I could not put this book down. The anecdotes of his youth are both brilliant and funny. Its inspiring to see what he accomplished by just hard work and a determined mindset. He paints the picture of the past really well, and its fascinating to imagine the world in the forties and fifties."

"438",437,"Lee","An awesome piece of work. I had seen the reviews and remained skeptical by Richard Feynman had me laughing over and over --- normally about situations where people overwhelmed with his apparent genius that they missed the obvious (e.g. file cabinet lock picking). In other cases, the tables were turned on Feynman like how to mix paint --- hilarious! I am even laughing about why the title is what it is...an awesome piece of writing providing a glimpse inside the man."

"469",468,"Kristi","Maybe the best book I have ever read!"
"470",469,"Andi","Pretty much, I think Feynman is an asshat. I don't find many of his antics all that funny. Creating a laugh at another's expense is never OK in my book. But, despite my personal objection to his version of humor, I enjoyed getting a look into the goings on in the physics community during his time. And, sophomoric humour aside, he does make some very thoughtful observations in regards to science AND to people. This book will definitely find its way onto my shelves."
"471",470,"Krollo","This book was pretty hilarious. Feynman shows everyone that he's awesome, yet oddly humble. There's something quintessential about his style of writing, combined with the writing, that makes this one awesome book."
"472",471,"Steve Mitchell","This collection of anecdotes from Richard P. Feynman was retold intermittently and informally to Ralph Leighton and transcribed and edited by Edward Hutchings. This book is not going to explain the origins of the universe but it is a masterful insight into the nature of scientific investigation and experimentation. The book also exposes Feynman as one of the most colourful and charismatic characters ever. He was – in no particular order – a Nobel prize-winning physicist, an artist, worked on the Manhattan Project, bongo player, practical joker, safe-cracker and a non-conformist genius. Genius is often a word bandied about to describe sports stars and actors when the description is not really justified; in Feynman’s case the word does not begin to describe what he was capable of. As well as possessing an immense understanding of his subject, he was also able to relay that to others with an infectious enthusiasm that just makes it a pleasure to find stuff out."

"487",486,"Riona"," My review: 5 stars My sister recommended this book to me and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it! Although it's not the type of book I usually read, I'm very happy I did read it.What can I say? Feynman was a very, very funny man. The ways in which he presents his stories had me laughing at many points. Not only was he exceedingly smart, but he seemed to be a very fun person to be around. This book taught me a lot about him and his life that I didn't know before, and some little tricks that could help me!Don't worry if you're not a physics person. A very basic understanding (i.e. maybe around GCSE level) will be fine (for the majority) of this book. I'm only doing my GCSEs now and I could understand it! And don't worry about it being a boring autobiography by a boring man - this wasn't dull at all and I got thoroughly engrossed in it.I would definitely recommend this book, and I will be reading more by him."
"489",488,"Karen Grothe","Richard Feynman was quite a character as well as being brilliant. This book covers various stories from his life including his childhood; his time at MIT, Princeton, Los Alamos, Cornell, and Caltech; and the time he marched through the streets of Copacabana playing a frigideira with a samba band. He tells fascinating stories and has a great sense of humor."
"493",492,"Katherine Collins","This conversational account of Richard Feynman’s development as a physicist is disarming: you are so busy shaking your head over his goofy practical jokes and constant curiosity that you almost forget this is one of the most brilliant scientists of our time. No matter what the puzzle, Feynman wanted to figure it out. A must-read for anyone hoping to solve puzzles of their own."
"499",498,"Trixie","A delightful read. I got this well-worn copy from a fellow Feynman fan. I enjoyed it so much that I passed it on. "
"502",501,"Elisabeth Hobbes","A very clever man, far too clever for me however hard I try and however many times I read it. He's also incredibly funny and eloquent discussing his work in physics and his practical jokes. I read the introductory section about his childhood experiments to my son while giggling loudly. Exactly the sort of person I'd like to go for a drink with. "

"527",526,"Julia Selker","Inspiring, hilarious, honest. He's also kind of an asshole about women. But he's kind of a genius at most other things."
"531",530,"Sampurna Ray","Simply amazing!"
"532",531,"Temesgen Feseha","This book showed me deep curious nature of the man and scientists in general. He has this sense of exploring everything from Science, Art to Music. And he was really practical with his explorations.Although he sounds full of himself sometimes, i say, its still worth it!I deeply Enjoyed this book."
"534",533,"Angel  Popa ","Richard Feynman possessed one of the most interesting personalities. While, also being a genius in physics. It is not a surprise that so many people have felt attracted to him. As was demonstrated by the big crowds that attended his famous lectures on physics (according to what I had read). I loved reading this book; it was such an incredible experience for myself. I was laughing with his stories, but from time to time I stopped reading just to think of the lecture I was receiving through such a conventional and mundane stories. I can recall several stories from the book, but one that I enjoy remembering, it is the way that he rejected the offer to become a professor at the University of Chicago. This book provides a lot of laughs and also plenty of stories to think about the way we approach science and learning. In Feynman's words, ""They learn the concepts; but don't know how to connect them"". Also, Feynman made some criticism of the way people in science perceive the way science should be tough. The last chapter of this book where Feynman talks about the cargo cult is one of the chapters that I have reread the most in my life. I already lost the count, and I can almost recite it by hard. "
"541",540,"Subhojit","This book is delight! The semi-autobiography written in the form of witty anecdotes with loads of humour and a dash of cunning is a pleasure to read. Dick Feynman was undoubtedly the coolest guy ever in the field of science... albeit a rascal(a Noble Prize winning one at that!). From the picking of locks to picking up girls... from repairing radios by ""thinking"" to making an entire door vanish... not to mention visiting (ahem!) topless bars- he seemed to have a finger in every pie conceivable. In the words of the great Hans Bethe, ""Feynman was a magician"". Indeed he was; perhaps the only one of his kind! And this book too.. is one of its kind."
"542",541,"Torgny","Very funny."
"548",547,"Dennis Ross","Re-read after a number of years, and enjoyed it even more. Feynman gave the ""Messenger Lectures"" when I was a freshman at Cornell in 1964. This book will be discussed at my book club, April 9 2012"
"549",548,"Christopher Roemer","Dr. Feynman really show you don't have to conform to the stereotypic mold to be a physicist. Also how much fun and beautiful physics and science in general is. Just as a piece Picasso artwork is beautiful. "
"554",553,"Claudine Tan","I have never loved many books this much. One of my abs fans."
"555",554,"Ipoy","My all time favorite scientist. I love his unique personality. This book will make you laugh,confused, wondered, sad, anything! "
"556",555,"Laurie Fiess","This is one of my all-time favorite books. I've always been a bit of a science groupie and loved getting a peek into the head of a genius. Feynman tells his story in such an accessible way, and it's an amazing story. From his days as a student to his courtship and marriage, to his days at Los Alamos, it's one man's perspective of a very important crossroads in our history. Feynman later went on to head the Challenger Commission that investigated what caused the 1988 explosion, and he died shortly after that. His ""Feynman Lectures on Physics"" are still sought after by students and laypeople alike. "
"560",559,"Wanda","I am convinced that Feynman is my spirit animal. But on a serious note, I feel so inspired by his attitude towards life, scientific integrity, and exploration of his creative side! I was slightly rubbed the wrong way by some of his antics in the woman-chasing department (When respect fails in approaching women, that they don't dispense sex after drinks are inserted, resort to being a jerk! I guess in that era, the idea of consent wasn't really well fleshed out), but at the same time, I was positively wrecked by the love and sense of loss I felt from the recounting of his first wife's death. He was a flawed man, but was more fascinating for it; I can only hope to live a life so filled with mirth and discovery!"
"564",563,"Sky","If you've ever had the pleasure of watching a video where Mr. Feynman speaks- his characteristic style comes through in his words. This book is an absolute pleasure to read, not only because of his fun and upbeat style, but because he plainly shows the world that his intelligence is all about his curiosity and wonderment with the world around him. Inspiring and fun, this one has laughs, science, and amazing history as told by one of the 20th century's greatest physicists and scientists.A recommended read for the curious."
"565",564,"Brennon","I've read it six times already, and I decided to pop the audiobook back on today. Such an amazing life for such an extraordinary man. It reads like a good novel, not a biography. Very light on physics and mathematics (it speaks a bit about his Nobel prize-winning discovery briefly, but the rest of the book is pure antics), it really attempts to portray the human side to the mathematical genius that is a hero to so many of those of us who love physics. If I could be half the man that Feynman was, my life would hardly be wasted. 'Surely You're Joking' makes you laugh, and then it makes you want to join in the fun. A good read."
"567",566,"Matt Johnson","Disclaimer: I am a nerd, and I am made even nerdier by my enjoyment of reading biographies of nerds past. But as scientist (auto-)bios go, this is one of the best.The good news for lesser nerds than I is that the style is not overly science-y, but it is definitely indicative of the way Feynman's mind work. Many of the stories are great anecdotes for whipping out at cocktail parties (i.e., Feynman used to do work over lunch at strip clubs because [he claims] the food was cheap and people tended to leave you alone there). A fun read even for the non-technically-minded."
"574",573,"Tomboy/girl","All the stories are HILARIOUSbut people need to KNOW a little college level of math to understand this(doesnt mean you have to be in college... im 13 yrs old)"

"583",582,"Alexander Sharafanenko","Лёгкая, но глубокая книга."
"585",584,"Aggie P","Feynmann was one of the best science writers out there and he did wonders to complex ideas brought down to earth. Who would have thought the man also had a scintillating sense of humor and wit! This is a book well worth reading many times."
"588",587,"Jane","Richard Feynmann was an incredible man, judging from this book. A great, quick read if you are looking for laughs and inspiration."
"597",596,"Amaan Cheval","I loved this book. Feynman's like the lovable quirky uncle who always has a good anecdote to share at the dinner table, and this book feels like a collection of all the anecdotes with a bunch of insights into his thinking process and opinions. Reads well, and is quite enjoyable!"
"598",597,"Kurtis Baute","Feynman was a genius. A hilarious, inquisitive, odd-ball, modest genius. This is not a book on quantum physics, nor a bragging autobiography of how this Nobel Laurette succeeded in so many ways; it is a book about the thrill of asking questions and trying to find the answers, about clever mischief, and an occasional lock-picking prank or bar-fight here or there. One of the greatest physicists in history tells his tale in a fun and matter-of-fact kind of way. When you read things like how he would go to a strip club to work on physics problems, you sometimes have to think: surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman!"
"599",598,"Szasza","This is probably one of the funniest books I've ever read, and it's about science. Well not really, as it is about a scientist, namely Richard P.Feynman, winner of the Physics Nobel Prize and hilariously witty genius. I loved this book, I loved the anecdotes, I loved the wittiness, I loved Mr. Feynman. Read this book. Now! Even if you have no clue about Physics, because I sure as hell haven't, and I enjoyed it very much."
"600",599,"Annette Abbott","Sorry, Richard, I'd like to say the reason I read this was because I wanted to know more about inner workings of a scientific mind. Truth be told, it was because I'd just finished my book club book and was still in the mood to read something -- this was at arms reach. Why this was in *my* office, I don't know -- my husband is the Caltech grad. Feynman was one of his professors.Though not a scientist, I'll admit I am a enough of a geek to enjoy all the Caltech Ditch Day stories and, ok, I'm a bit ""starstruck"" whenever I hear friends and family refer to personal encounters they've had with science heavyweights: Feynman, Einstein, Hawking... A Wikipedia knowledge coupled with such anecdotes sufficed through the years till I picked this book up. Some say he comes off a bit egotistical. True, but his voice is so casual and the anecdotes are so laugh-out-loud funny that you find yourself forgiving him. His autobiography doesn't require deep physics knowledge -- for me, that was a positive. I don't want details on why he received a Nobel Prize -- what I wanted to know was where he was when he got the news, what happened at the ceremony, etc. -- basically the tabloid coverage. Shallow, I know, but I'm being honest here. After finishing the book, I asked my husband so many questions about Feynman. He pulled a volume of the Feynman Lectures from one of his shelves and said ""Want to see something...?"" He then showed me an inscription saying ""Thanks for the music, Dick"" ""What does that mean?"" I asked. ""I made a music cassette for him. Why are you asking so many questions about Feynman anyway?"" ""No reason. Just something I read."" "

"606",605,"Sujeet Gholap","What an apt title for the book! Jaw-dropping, eye-popping, simply amazing!!We've all had curiosities and eccentricities, and we've all seen those fizzle and die out as we grow. In Feynman's memoirs I found what an inexplicable joy it would bring only if we keep fueling our curiosity, our thirst for learning.He's funny, he's charming, he's a bomb of energy and inspiration! Having a penchant for drama, and a flair for showmanship, Feynman vividly brings alive those moments when he astonished his co-workers by opening their safes , when, as a child, he left people slack-jawed by ""fixing radios by just thinking"" and when he left a military building again and again without appearing to be entering it!Feynman touches upon a wide range of topics: each more interesting than the others! Hypnosis, lucid dreaming, isolation tanks, tribal rituals, folk music, education system, conventions and customs, scientific integrity, mind-reading ... you name it, Feynman would have something interesting to offer. Thoroughly entertaining, highly inspirational, and, at times, thought provoking, all I can think abut this book is ""Why didn't I read it before??"""

"610",609,"Berry","I found Feynman’s adventurous approach to life highly entertaining and enlightening."
"614",613,"Andy Klein","What a wonderful life and book. "
"615",614,"David Musgraves","An absolute classic for me. This was probably my tenth re-read, and my first in a number of years. His views on women are a bit antiquated, but it's all part of his ""what do you care what other people think"" philosophy. A must-read for anyone serious about science or education."
"622",621,"Randy Jensen","This has always been one of my favorite books. I wish I had found it earlier in life - it might have had an even bigger impact. As someone who has to figure out how everything works myself, it's great to know that this is a positive attribute!"
"623",622,"Cynthia","Feynman is just brilliant -- it's that simple."
"627",626,"Travis","Richard Feynman was an amazing fellow who accomplished great things. Yet, while reading his not really autobiography, you really feel like he's just another buddy at the office. A very smart, kind of odd, buddy, but a buddy none the less. Feynman is not just a great teach about physics, but also about life. A must read for any aspiring scientist and a good read for everybody else. "
"631",630,"Saif","It was a damn good read. He comes of so darn humble even though it's obvious he is one of the most accomplished geniuses of our time. Love the book."
"634",633,"Ariel","I don't mean to overstate, but this book changed my life. I should re-read it."
"635",634,"Brian Mikołajczyk","A great book where Feynman describes his adventures though life. Always searching for knowledge and always being mischievous, this book contains many anecdotes that are genuinely hilarious."
"636",635,"Chelsea Phillips","Brilliant! His approach to everyday questions was especially interesting. I'm inspired to pursue my casual interests with more intensity and to ask more questions when people make absurd sounding claims. All excellent things. "
"639",638,"Toan","đọc hồi ký/ tự truyện của những thiên tài như này chỉ càng thấy những thứ thiên tài là do thiên định :D"
"642",641,"Cesar Gonzalez","Loved it. Not really a biography per se, but a collection of wonderful anecdotes about Feynman's life. Feynman was a brilliant physicist with a zest for life, a mischievous streak, and a decidedly un-scientist personality. Read this book if you want to laugh, to be thoroughly entertained, and to learn a little something about how to live life."
"645",644,"Pieter Laeremans","Very interesting biography, funny, informative. "
"646",645,"Robsclone","Even if not a ""sciency"" person - this is entertaining, informative, and makes me want to be the type of person he describes himself as. A++, says me."
"647",646,"Andrej Karpathy","I love this book so much. I really want to give it 6/5. I read and re-read it often, and Feynman is one of my personal top heroes. "
"650",649,"Gizem","''Surely'' one of my all time favourite-books ever! I used to be an engineering student who does not enjoy physics classes and I wondered why some people loved it so much and what is so interesting about it. Then somehow I found this book.Feynman's mind, somewhat socially awkwardness (yes, the book's name is about that subject!), his curiosity, his writing style, everything made me think and enjoy, changed so many things for the better way for me.This book is simple, funny and beautiful. I guess so many readers will love this curious childish soul. "
"651",650,"William Herschel","Richard Feynman was really, really cool. In his book ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" we get a collection of stories in a loose time line from childhood and up until he won a Nobel Prize. Most stories focus on humour but also focus on learning through understanding and curiosity.The writing is very casual, as if Feynman himself were telling you the story in person. Despite my favoring exceptional writing over anything, this collection really worked for me. Feynman has a lot of interesting experiences and his eccentricity was easy for me to relate to-- and maybe that's why I enjoyed this so much. It's a rare occurrence when I read about something and can really relate to it. It's nice. I plan to read more about him."
"653",652,"Shashank","An Excellent insight into the mind of the one of the most famous physicist of all time.A view into the great curiosity and way he enjoyed his life...Simply Entertaining."
"655",654,"Chris Kasper","Brilliant and witty! Feynman reviews scenes from his life and at the same time reveals how to live a good life in science."
"656",655,"Bram","This book is amazing! This book is not about physics. Instead, it is full of extremely funny stories about one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century.Some overlap with the book ""Feynman - The Pleasure of Finding Things Out""."
"657",656,"Noli Watson","Most people involved with science have probably run into Feynman's lecture on ""cargo cult science,"" which makes up the last chapter of this book. The whole affair is like that: casual, funny, deeply insightful. It's not really about physics--it's extremely accessible and written in an informal, spoken style, peppered with onomatopoeia and capslock. His thoughts on the Manhattan project are especially gripping. I can't recommend this book enough. "
"658",657,"TimV","One of my favorite snippets...While on the Manhatten Project, Feynman and his fellow scientists were kept under heavy security, with a guard carefully tracking their comings and goings. Check Out, Check In, Check Out, Check In. But Feynman found a hole in the fence. Check In, Check In, Check In. Check Out, Check Out, Check Out.This is also where he perfected his safe cracking technique. "
"662",661,"Jerad Acosta","One of my all time favorite books. This book has entertainment, life style and state of mind wrapped around some of the greatest moments leading up to modern physics.Feynman is well known for bringing elegance and simplicity into science without losing its awe-inspiring luster; I would argue this book shows he was just as capable of doing the same for everyday life.This is also a great book to come back too. I have this book straight through at least 3 times and have periodically dipped into a chapter for years"
"663",662,"Alessio","Brilliant."
"665",664,"Tmittman","Quick fascinating read by a Nobel Prize winner who remains an everyman when he clearly is not. What a guy. Led me to read several other works about him and by him. ""Genius"" is another biography about him which is worth a read. Can't remember the author. Tom"

"677",676,"Uday Desai","Witty, and funny! I wish I would have been in student for few years."
"678",677,"Shashwat Singh","Richard Feynman was a noble prize winning physicist. This book is his autobiography, which he tells mainly as a series of anecdotes. This isn't a scientific treatise, but more the tales, adventures and challenges of a man who lived life to the fullest while contributing significantly to humanity. It's highly accessible, so you don't need a degree in Physics or Mathematics to enjoy the book although that may help with a few sections.The reason I enjoyed this book is because of Feynman's curiosity and interest in life and the world. He learned various hobbies such as picking locks(which he used to pick locks at Los Alamos) or playing drums in a Samba band in Brazil. He deeply enjoyed his work and had a dedication to the truth. His integrity and honesty is refreshing, especially in our modern era of carefully managing our reputations and monitoring what we say. I highly doubt a modern physician would admit to going to a topless bar to get work done, and then testify in favor of that bar in court to prevent it from being closed. I highly recommend this book, and it will definitely inspire you to be more open minded and try new things or hobbies. "

O njemu kritičar Timea kaže: Neobuzdano… Feynman ispucava svoje pustolovine u fizici, biologiji, umjetnosti i glazbi… Lančana reakcija nije loša usporedba za Feynmanom život. Iz kritične mase sive stvari grunula je u svim smjerovima, proizvodeći i toplinu i svjetlost.Izdavač ističe na koricama: U svijetu nuklearne fizike i dobitnika Nobela, ne postoji nitko poput Feynmana… Ova knjiga divna je serija kratkih kadrova, uspomena jedne karijere… Prvoklasno štivo – i poslastica za one koji možda još ne znaju za Feynmanovo profinjeno ludilo.Treći veli: Ova je knjiga puna vinjeta koje oslikavaju čovjeka opsjednutog i oduševljenog zagonetkama svake vrste, od vještine provaljivanja u sefove do otkrivanja fizičkih zakona beta raspada… Užitak za čitanje.Evo, kad sam sve ovo naveo, bit će vam svima jasno zašto preporučujem ovu knjigu."

I do!"
"693",692,"Pavel Evstigneev","Great book about life of great man"

"697",696,"Liam Dillow","If the crew from Big Bang Theory was hired to do a Dos Equis commercial, they would star Mr. Feynman saying ""Stay Thirsty, My Friends"". He is the Ernest Hemingway of science without the depression. He explains how a scientist thinks and conceptualizes things in such an engaging, insightful way that this this book should be required reading for all science educators. I should say that this was another time, and at times he can come off as a bit of a cheauvanist, but overall a great read. I don't always read biographical short stories, but when I do, I read this book. "

"712",711,"Onshore Paik"," I think this book to be an essential read for aspiring scientists (such as myself) and everyone else. It is both humorous and inspiring and is a beautiful insight into the life of someone who sincerely loved his field of study and lived out his existence to its fullest.  Although this book constantly makes the reader laugh aloud, it also contains some serious topics such as the matter of scientific integrity which Professor Feynman discusses at great length in the last chapter. All throughout this book, but especially in this last chapter, you can see the incredible extent of love and devotion Professor Feynman had for science.  It is true, as I've read in many negative reviews, that Professor Feynman tends to skim over his relationships with other people, making this book seem rather self-centered. However, I think that aspect is part of what makes this memoir/autobiography so real and interesting. After all, we are all the center of our own lives and the suns of our personal solar systems. "
"714",713,"So Hakim","Physicist Richard Feynman (1918-1988) gave insight to many aspects of a physicist's life. Funny, brilliant, bawdy -- this book tells the reader that it's not all about lab and equations. Slice-of-life anecdotes are available as well as more science-y topics."
"718",717,"Snarf","Very entertaining book of essays writing by a nutcase who's not afraid to admit that he's a weird (and funny) nutcase. Also he is brilliant. Great little surprising anecdotes from a different time and a very different mind. Richard Feynman is a character and his ever curious way about the world is inspiring. "
"719",718,"Tmillet","My favorite Feynman. Michelle (the wife) and I had a book swap where she picked a book for me and I picked a book for her. I made her listen to this one. See her review of it for how non-scientist persons may like this book. As for me I loved it. Feynman was a very inspiring writer, he just makes you want to go out and discover and experiment and ask 'why?'. I find his personality to be almost childlike in curiosity and naiveness. I find his books to be very genuine as he's able to make feelings into words that I often cannot. Plus it was just interesting to hear of so many stories from a man that led a rather interesting life...for a geeky scientist that is."

"728",727,"Ashwin","In this book, physicist Richard Feynman recollects various interesting and funny anecdotes from his life. Such as his physics research, childhood, beautiful females, topless bars, art, music, languages, winning the Nobel Prize, universities, life as a professor etc. This guy is surely one of the most interesting characters I've come across.

I learned about physics, relationships, cracking safes and living life adventurously! I wish I could have met Richard Feynman for he is now one of my greatest role models."
"732",731,"Jakub","Two words: absolutely brilliant. I think most of the appeal stems from the fact that you just don't perceive a Nobel prize candidate as a ""normal"" person. Well, think again. Feynman talks about different episodes from his life, some of them good, some of them bad, but most of them - unusual, fun and - as the title has it - curious. Fantastic read, and I think I found my new role model."

"750",749,"Maureen","I read this book some time ago, I very much enjoyed reading it again. There is a great deal to learn from Feynman, and it isn't just physics. He is a great role model for trying to think outside the box, and for developing critical thinking skills. The stories are not well written in the conventional sense, which makes sense when you realize that they are extracted from his spoken versions of these events. But that is no matter to their value. My favorite story, I think, is the one describing his adventures in Brazil, and learning to play a Brazilian instrument and parading in the Carnaval, just for the fun and experience and learning. While Feynman was goofing around and doing crazy things like that (hanging around in a stripper bar, learning to be an artist) he was doing work that qualified him for a Nobel Prize. Which he wasn't too happy about, as it resulted in people treating him too deferentially. Definitely on my list of people who I would like to meet (were he still alive)."
"755",754,"Annmarie","This is a very good book. I found it entertaining and funny. I have known many brilliant minds in my life and most of them are just like this. The book moves quickly through stories and adventures. I sometimes had to put it down to let my brain catch up. I would have loved to have coffee with Mr. Feynman and this book is just like that."

"758",757,"Union Palenshus","Never has a book made me feel so dumb. That's not a bad thing though, and this book is engaging, hilarious, and often thought provoking. He reminds me of myself when I'm at my best, interested in the world and eager to try out new activities and solve the puzzles that life presents. Thanks Feynman for the reminder of my complacency!"
"759",758,"Sriram Kowshika","One of my ""the favorites"" :)"
"761",760,"Saurabh Tomar","what a pleasure, Richard Feynman's passion for science was remarkable,the man who talk science, breathe science and think science but still because of his unquenchable curiosity and eternal skepticism, he led an adventurous life which is arguably inspiring and humorous in parts. i wonder that time at Los Alamos when greats like Einstein, Bohr and Feynman were together,from there modern science took a giant leap forward. Feynman thanks for making me believe that passion only leads to hard work which in-turn results in success. finally i will culminate this by lines of his dear friend Hans Bethe:There are two types of genius. Ordinary geniuses do great things, but they leave you room to believe that you could do the same if only you worked hard enough. Then there are magicians, and you can have no idea how they do it. Feynman was a magician"
"762",761,"Robert Sutherland","It's an interesting life to say the least when one person learns to be a safecracker, able to steal top secret government research at whim. But that same person also traveled overseas to join a samba band and played on the beaches of Rio during Carnival. Then he learned to sketch and drew models including a playboy centerfold, getting good enough that he sold his work. And there were the experiences of sensory deprivation where he tried to induce hallucinations by being immersed a dark tank of water at body temperature.Oh yeah, and there is his work on the Manhattan project and the Nobel Prize for Physics that he won. Richard P. Feynman had a curious spirit, always asking questions, learning something new. He loved the way things worked and wanted to know more about them, often questioning the basic assumptions that we all take for granted. From fixing radios as a boy to learning the norms of polite society at Princeton and European royal courts, Feynman's anecdotes had me often smiling and sometimes laughing at the seemingly ridiculous situations he found himself in. I read this book 10-12 years ago, and came back to it again recently, enjoying it even more the second time. There is some talk of science, and a knowledge of the topic will likely enhance your enjoyment, but the anecdotes are clever, many of which will put a smile on your face."

"768",767,"Hossein Farahani","Extremely funny and inspiring."
"772",771,"Burningred","I loved the stories in this book. Richard Feynman is the man when it comes to common reasoning in science. Everyone can indeed fix a radio with their mind."
"778",777,"Gautam Soman","This book, written by Richard Feynman, a Nobel Laureate in Physics, is one of the most popular books written by a scientist and undoubtedly one of my all-time favourites. Here, Feynman recounts his capers from the years spent at Princeton, Cornell, Caltech as well as anecdotes in connection with work on atom bomb (the Manhattan Project) at Los Alamos.Throughout the book, Feynman comes across as an extraordinary combination of high intelligence, sharp mind, unlimited curiosity about every aspect of life, and above all, a fine sense of humour.Vivid, lively and unpretentious, this is one book that you return to time and again!"
"782",781,"Galit Shiri","Enjoyed it completely.What a treat :)"

"784",783,"Betsy Zajko","A perfect quick read intro to the passion of physicists and why some lay people really love a good physics book. "
"785",784,"Brendan","What started out as an overly scientific recommendation from Reddit turned into an incredibly enjoyable journey through the life of one of the most interesting men ever.Every story Feynman told in this book had a moral and a purpose. His views on learning, understanding and just being a decent human being (and not a faker) are spot-on. I'll definitely be reading more from him in the future. Recommended for everyone."
"787",786,"Lisa Giles","A collection of stories from an adventurous and open-minded man who also happened to be a Nobel Prize winning physicist. With excellent quotes such as ""Gee! How am I gonna get started talking to this beautiful nude babe?"" It was a really, really entertaining read and I may end up reading some of the other Feynman books as well."
"790",789,"Zeynep","to see the world through his mind...it was wonderful!!"
"798",797,"Gabriel Nicholas","This was one of the greatest books I've read in a long time. Richard P. Feynman inspires readers to love the both the scientific method and his ""grab life by the horns"" outlook. His breadth of experience is simultaneously dumbfounding and inspirational. Even for those with no familiarity with the field of physics (like myself) this book is wonderful.I will certainly be reading What Do You Care What Other People Think? next."

"804",803,"Cherry","A wonderful read. Although Feynman sounds pompous, Its worth reading. I wish I had read this book as a kid. Certainly has changed my outlook. "
"805",804,"Tori","Richard Feynman is hilarious! His stories are wonderful and takes you on a journey of his life -- through academia and through his work in New Mexico during the making of the atomic bomb."
"808",807,"kevin","Just started reading this classic. Much more personal than those economics-to-explain-it-all books genre. Turned out to be a great book, or the right book at the right moment. It is a series of anecdotes from a smart and irreverent person on events that shaped the way he does or think about things. Inspirational in some regards for the different ""adventures"" he took in learning Spanish, Japanese, Drumming, Drawing, Safe Cracking and thinking about the idea which eventually won him the Nobel prize. The five-star is warranted because it revitalizes a part of me, to say the least, and may well be the trigger to some future changes in my life. "
"810",809,"Laird Bennion","I was expecting something a little more dry and with fewer strip clubs. The shenanigans he gets up to are top-notch, however. A surprisingly fast read with periodic jumps into physics. "
"812",811,"Uttara Soumyanarayanan","What a fab book! The book is not written in a flowery language as one would expect from a Nobel Laureate, its simple candid, plain conversational. Feynman talks about all his experiences and achievements in such a matter of factly manner. A Physics Nobel Laureate, Painter, Safe cracker, Drummer- he surely was a magician.. Highly recommended at times when you feel low in your research life!"
"813",812,"Immen","I've just read this, quite illegally, on http://www.gorgorat.com/, somewhat to my bemusement. I wasn't really intending to read the whole thing -- I remember how impossibly long it seemed my first time through, when I must have been 8 or so. Actually, it was so impossibly long, I didn't get through all of it. I distinctly recall I found the chapter ""7 percent solution"" difficult to follow. But it's funny reading this again! I just kept tumbling along from story to story, and all sorts of memories came tumbling back. I had a fat, fat, paperback edition -- too fat for its own health; it was held together with duct tape -- and I must have read it during recess, ensconced in a pile of coats at the edge of the cement yard, indulging my unsociable proclivities. My dad gave me the book; it was pretty far from my usual fare (the mythology section of the school library, occasional mind-warping 19th century girls' bildungsroman), but I ended up reading it pretty closely. It was formative.A favorite book."

"820",819,"Amulya Neelam","If the quality of life is measured by the number of stories you have to tell by the end of it, this man surely led a splendid life.Stories after stories, Richard P. Feynman’s life is marked by a raging curiosity, a love for learning and a never-give-up attitude. While the beginning of the ride was a little bumpy, owing to the abrupt and concise nature of the narrative, it got better as I came to terms with the idea that these are anecdotes, of course they’re going to end abruptly and the next ones start with no relation to the previous ones. The content makes up everything else, I swear.All the times he delights with his various adventures – from his tinkering to women to art and music and bombs and of course Science, there is an underlying theme of education and learning, with Feynman questioning the norms and conventions everywhere. This made me wonder. How much was he a product of his environment and how much due to his own inherent self? I’d like to think the environment is a factor too because then we can teach kids this – to question, to never accept things on face value and to persist in thought and action. Oh, just the idea gives me goosebumps!Once again, I can’t help but feel grateful towards the idea of books; that I can live with a person whom I’d have never even seen otherwise. I recommend this book to those who love science, those who don’t or simply, those who love life. I would also love to hand a copy to every child in my vicinity if not for the slightly misogynistic tones. But I forgive you, Dick. Because the times were such."
"821",820,"Vladyslav","Simply amazing.. I haven't read such a wonderful book for a while.I don't event have enough skills to express my feelings about this book in the writing form. I even created special bookshelf to put this book to.I remember I found reference to this book during some forum discussion about good literature for scientists. I come up to the book in my Kindle during short flight and started to read it.. and I just couldn't stop! One could simply made a movie based on his life experience. I admire Mr. Feynman!I have seen comment that he is too egoistic or too ""jerk"" and that is definitely true. Hey, the guy is one of the greatest scientists of XX century he has a right to be eccentric! But the book itself and stories it covers worth reading.. One thing reader should be aware of: sometimes it requires advanced knowledge in math and physics. It happens rarely but the book is about Nobel laureate in physics after all..Again, amazing reading."
"823",822,"Antonio Gutierrez","Richard Feynman shows a exotic mixture of charisma and intellect the kind that few have.The book is a kind of autobiographical summary of his life with brutal honesty of varied topics such as meeting women, upbringing, culture among scientists, prejudices, working on Los Alamos for the Manhattan Project and of course, physics.This is, naturally, a very simplified summary of the themes, but equally relevant and interesting as the actual themes are the qualities found in between: the utter pursuit of truth by experimentation and observation, and how much joy he found by working things out by himself.There are however certain remarks that could be regarded as misogyny but then again, he was human after all, and those were different times back then.Overall excellent read! "
"826",825,"Barry","I think you can gauge my response here: http://bjhess.com/blog/feynman/"
"827",826,"Инк Лонгтан","Потрясающая книга о жизни одного ученого, рассказанная самим ученым. Ученый с большой буквы, Ричард Ф Фейнман. Господство интеллекта, догадки и нестандартных решений над предубеждениями, суевериями, тупостью и снобизмом. В общем-то, прочитав ее, вы поймете ученых и их дух исследования."
"829",828,"Sheryll","A peek into the mind of a great thinker, this little book is full of thought-provoking moments. It prompted a visit to Youtube.com to see Dr. Feynman in person in several interviews and while playing his bongo drums. What a character!"
"832",831,"Bradley Schaefer","Really inspirational book. There was a theme of honesty and integrity throughout the anecdotes. Lots of very clever and funny moments told in a matter of fact style."
"833",832,"Milan Navratil","An absolutely amazing book that is going to influence the way I think for years to come. A must-read for anybody with a curious mind - both entertaining and insightful."
"835",834,"Sunny Gulati","I was totally inspired by reading this book. Something about the joy with which he learned... Highly recommended. "
"836",835,"Squishyent","This book contains no science. Instead, it's a collection of recollections from one of the foremost physicists of the last century - on everything but science. It's an account of how a life was lived. It's very entertaining! He talks about learning instruments in Brazil to participate in Carnival, practicing his drawing in a strip club, and playing practical jokes on the guards while he worked on the Manhattan Project. The book is an excellent contradiction of the stereotype that scientists' lives begin and end with their fields."
"843",842,"Fil Krynicki","What I loved most about this book was the ability of a person of clearly outstanding intellectual prowess to share their science, and ideas, in plain text. There is a temptation in writing that I imagine many are familiar with to delve the depths of vocabulary and grammar to produce language as art. While this is valuable for sense, it is not so valuable for communication. Feynman's memoires are an excellent example of good old communication, and regardless of what you think of his social views, the anecdotes and lessons are wonderful to experience."
"849",848,"Loosak","Kniha která změnila můj pohled na svět"
"850",849,"Ville","So fun, I had to really laugh out loud while reading this. Got addicted from start to end, and I felt it ended way to early.His pranks are marvelous, and his curiosity is inspiring! I too have engaged in lock-picking for the exact same reason: the puzzle they provide is addictive!I heard of Mr. Feynman as a great teacher and thought I would like to know more about his persona. His humor, curiosity, and honesty shown in this book, has made me buy more of his books. I look forward to do the Feynman lectures one day."
"851",850,"Thanh Tai","very funny book. you do not need to read lots of stuff about physics when reading a book of the physicist. but maybe some info about how lock work, some basic math would be helpful. anyway, a good book to read through the whole day thanks to its funny stories.the most inspiration would be doesnt care about your responsibility toward the society in which you live, because you simply dont need to. just do what you like."

"860",859,"Anurag","I read this book during graduation and I have read it over 10 times since. It has recollections made by Richard Feynman. Strange as it may seem that the semi autobiography of Nobel winning scientist is so humorous and a great pick for light reading.The single most best thing about the book is that it doesn’t have any plot; you can flip open to any chapter and start reading. This book contains a series of pranks that Feynman pulled during his time as a student at M.I.T, his time with his three wives, his lunch time at the strip clubs and the atom bomb. Reading this book one realizes the person and the personality called Feynman. I thoroughly enjoyed this book right till the end (and it also managed to raise a few smiles). A must read for everyone looking for something witty and funny to read."
"861",860,"Rafee Adnan","this book moved me..i don't know what to say about this book..this book is inspirational plus the best part is you can get into the head of Richard Feynman..I became a fan of him reading his lectures..he's one of the reason why i chose to do my bachelor degree in physics..so it was great to get a peek into his adventurous life..so at end of the day its a great book!..:)"
"865",864,"Helena","Mr. Feynman can make anyone laugh and love Science."
"872",871,"MikeFromQueens","Exactly the point. A real person doing real things. Feynman is spectacular in his pedestrian descriptions of the most extraordinary goings on, and becomes such a story-teller of his own life. I have given this book to graduating high-school seniors who are enthralled with physics. The others get ""The Fountainhead."""
"873",872,"Sri","Intinya adalah: mempelajari science adalah dengan pemahaman, bukan hafalan. Memutuskan sesuatu adalah setelah mempelajarinya sendiri bukan hanya setelah mendengar apa kata orang. Beliau prihatin dengan orang yang males mikir. Doh, saya memang memprihatinkan :(.Ada yang bilang buku ini menunjukkan egonya yang besar. Aku tidak melihatnya seperti itu. Kalaupun iya, tidak apa-apa. Dengan kualitasnya yang seperti itu kata orang Jawa cucuk lah. Ora mung waton :D."
"879",878,"Chris Watkins","Intelligent and cutting - he seems to have a reputation for embellishing his stories though, so I'd like to know how accurate it actually is."
"881",880,"Otis Chandler","This book was a pure delight. The subtitle ""Adventures of a Curious Character"" is spot-on. Feynman gave an amazingly human and honest view into his philosophy and take on life, thought a series of stories.One thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things. You would think a world-famous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics - but Feynman was curious about everything he saw. He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show, he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them, he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling, he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women, he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun - the list goes on! My take: you should have your passions - but you should also have your hobbies. I think I need a new hobby :)I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system. He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to. I think this is not a unique problem in education.Another lesson learned from Feynman's studies of science is to never take any data for granted. Always always question the sources. Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would re-generate many of the numbers on his own - even if they had been published in other places. For many things we are (and not just in science) standing on the shoulders of giants. The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with. I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist, with real integrity. And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles. This book was a light-hearted attempt to point that out - not to mention, a very entertaining read."
"882",881,"Constance","""So I have just one wish for you--the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.""A good ending quote. This man inspires me to pick up more hobbies and to approach them with the intent of becoming good/excellent at them. "
"885",884,"Vijaysrj","Very funny and inspiring. Feyman's curiosity in subjects other than science(music,drawing,languages) are very interestesting too. Definitely a must read for anyone curious to read an inspiring book."

"897",896,"Ben Galbraith","A light, inspiring, fun read. Feynman's insatiable curiosity is a revelation on how to view the world. I've already started paying closer attention to phenomena (and mundanity) that I have previously ignored, and am finding great satisfaction from doing so. Highly recommended."

"906",905,"Kyle Boddy","An excellent overview of Richard Feynman's life and how he thought. Reinforced much of my anti-intellectual stance; simply knowing the names of things is not the same as actually knowing the subject material. Touches on the concept of how difficult it really is to ""know"" something. "
"908",907,"Aayaam","Richard Feynman was a true genius, and I believe the joking and humorous way in which his autobiography is written captures it in a way that is both informative and captivating for all audiences."
"910",909,"Martin Ocenas","An excellent book which brings very nice picture of the mindset that belongs to someone who is really smart, talented and curious. Moreover, if you think scientist are crazy, you're quite right, but boring? Far from it. I've had great time with this book and I caught my self laughing quite loud quite often."

"914",913,"Ben Pace","I am not sure how to review this book. The stories are inspirational, and absorbing. Seeing how Feynman thinks is an insight into the functioning of a quite marvellous mind, and he is an excellent story-teller. He intersperses stories about his fascination with science, with stories about the flaws he sees in academia and education, with just really fun stories. And even then, they're all really good fun. I'll be giving this to all of my friends."

"919",918,"Vladimir Tsebenko","Great."
"920",919,"Peterh","This was a really wonderful book by a truly brilliant man. Feynman regales the reader with tales of his adventures without a hint of pretention. Though he discusses some mathematical and scientific ideas, any lay person can easily enjoy the book the whole way through. Reading this fun and funny anthology is sure to instil the virtues of curiosity, problem solving and adventure in the reader."
"921",920,"Daan","De in 1988 overleden Richard Feynman was een enthousiast en intelligent persoon die geen enkele mogelijkheid schuwde om de wereld beter te begrijpen. Deze leergierigheid uitte zich niet alleen in een Nobelprijs voor de Natuurkunde maar ook in vele andere mooie verhalen. Feynman repareerde al als kind de radio's in zijn omgeving, werkte mee aan de atoombom (Manhattan Project), kraakte de kluizen van zijn collega's, maakte indruk op Brazilianen met zijn Portugees en danste 's nachts al trommelend om de bomen in het bos. Uit al deze avonturen komt een sympathieke wetenschapper naar voren die als boodschap meegeeft dat je het gelukkigst wordt als je je persoonlijke integriteit zoveel mogelijk weet te bewaren."
"922",921,"Susanne","A brilliant mind shares stories of his life. Intriguing, funny, savvy. It makes you want to go out and discover things. A must-read, even for people who don't understand a lot of modern physics."

"934",933,"Ryan Veiga","This book is what started me on the road to becoming a physics major."
"938",937,"Jodie","This book is from a Nobel Prize winner's point of view about several interesting and funny experiences he had. It talks about how he likes experimenting and how he noticed how some people learn by memorizing, and they don't actually understand what they're learning. Some parts are confusing and hard to understand, but overall it is funny and very interesting, so I recommend it."
"941",940,"NC Weil","Richard Feynman wrote a very entertaining autobiography. Open-eyed and prepared to question everything, and to be honest about what he saw and felt, he upset many people while making himself indispensable to others. He was also something of a trickster. He worked on the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico, a very junior researcher who soon had the ear of the ""heavy hitters"" because he was unafraid of their greatness and reputations, and they could count on him to give an unvarnished assessment of their ideas. He taught himself to pick locks and made a mockery of the base's security.The love of Feynman and his wife, who was hospitalized with cancer while he worked there, led them to create a code to evade the censors so they could communicate honestly with one another. His intuition was accurate and surprising. When he was sent to inspect a TVA facility, he looked at the blueprints (never having read one), and put his finger on a particular symbol. ""What about this?"" The particular valve he pointed out turned out to be central to the problem they were having with a nuclear power plant. Later he was on the committee investigating the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster, and through experimentation and curiosity, posited an O-ring on one of the gigantic fuel tanks had failed because it was too cold to function properly. He was right.If you think science, especially physics, is dry and boring, you really ought to give Richard Feynman a chance to change your mind! "

"949",948,"Lacey.","Actual rating:10/10One of the most entertaining memoirs/compilations of anyone's life I've ever read. There is so much to learn and appreciate when reading this book, that you can't come out of it feeling like you haven't gained something. Whether it was a little more insight into a great mind,thirst for knowledge,a respect for scientific and logical integrity, or an appreciation of each invaluable moment in time we have, to create and love a world we want to live in. Superb experience in reading this book."

"957",956,"Razvan Zamfirescu","Pentru acest titlu stelele de pe goodreads sunt prea putine-o duzina ar fi fost mai potrivite.

"972",971,"Dragos Iordachioaia","What an utterly fantastic man. Before reading this book I could hardly fancy the idea that anyone, much less a Nobel Prize winner, could do so much and acquire so many skills in a lifetime. But there he was, learning to play samba music, becoming a drawing artist and so many other things that had nothing to do with physics, his main interest. And all that just because Feynman was a man who liked to live and more importantly, loved to think. Ever pushing, sweating, grinding. Leading by example, here depicted at its best."
"973",972,"Adriel","Funny!"
"975",974,"Ryan Knight","What a fun story about the life and times of the famous physicist! What sticks with me most is how he approached every problem in life so optimistically and found enjoyment working through the problem and not just in solving it. Though the positive perspective may have been something that came to him later in life it's inspiring to think about the benefits of deeply engaging life's challenge with such of an optimistic attitude. I also found relief in how all the entertaining and goofy story of Feynman's life. It's easy to think all scientists are nerds who don't engage life on a social or emotional level but Feynman reminds us that everyone wants to have some fun even when tasked with such a critical responsibility as developing an atomic bomb."
"976",975,"Konstantinos Georgokitsos","Great insight into a great mind, and how he thought. I do prefer this series of snapshots by himself to a proper biography."
"979",978,"Seif Sallam","Really enjoyable journey. Don't take life too seriously, have fun, learn new things, expose yourself to variety, and do silly things from time to time."
"989",988,"Greg Talbot","To anyone looking for a book about a man who did learned all the right lessons, took all the right courses, mustered his ability and really made something of himself - this book is not for you.Granted, Mr. Feynman is an award winning Nobel Prize winner, and comes across as brillant and well-respected. But the book is not about his ""successes"", or god no, it's about Mr. Fenyman's stubbornness, openness, sexual prowess, and hilarious deviance that lands him in unusual situations.His early anecdotes start auspiciously with his ability to get into in good respectful positions and starting his passion with physicas. But the story becomes so much more interesting, as he--loses the story. His child-wonder turn from academic accolades to the pursuit and conquests of women across the world. Fenyman has this great dichotomy of being in tune with his passions but this academic disconnect in his social situations. Other cheeky endeavors get him into unbeaten paths - a rich artistic career, a drum aficionado, a disruptor to educational conferences and general DIY dude.There's life lessons to be had too. Not from any canned advice, but from living in principle, living with integrity, and not being afraid to experience the more extreme parts of life. "
"990",989,"Yotamhod24","one of my favorite books of all time. "
"992",991,"Ellee","This book is a series of anecdotes collected from Richard Feynman by the editor, Edward Hutchings. The subtitle, ""Adventures of a Curious Character"" really is an understatement! While I am not sure if I'd have wanted to date Feynman, he definitely sounds like someone who'd have been fun to meet and get to know.Highly recommended for those interested in finding out more about the people behind the sciences and for people who enjoy funny stories. A very quick, enjoyable read."

Feynman is one of my favorite scientists and I have been a big fan for some time now. Trying to be objective I can say that the book is nice, not boring (super fun if you are into science) and super interesting. It should be obligatory for everyone studying science (I consider the chapters about his time in Brazil and the last one highly valuable to any student in general).I can only say that the book kept me with a smile in the face all the time. The book will make you love science and can help to dismiss some of the myths about scientist (introverted-weirdo guys). I love the book and will recommend it until the end of my days… (not joking)."
"1004",1003,"Vladimir Prus","Everybody should read this book. I originally read parts of this as a teenager, in Russian translation and it was entertaining, with the stories of opening safes and finding flaws in uranium refinement facilities. Reading the full book, I found more entertaining stories, like about playing drums at Rio carnival. And then I finished the book, and things clicked together into something more important.Feyman has accomplished quite a lot, so what can we learn? Between funny stories, we see that he was gave focused attention to everything he tried, even such things as playing drums or cracking safes or painting. He did not care much about social norms (visiting strip clubs to drink some 7-up), or impressions (calling stupid ideas as such right away), or being organized (nearly sleeping in a pile of fallen leaves once). The last chapter say the most important thing is to be ""utterly honest"". By the contrast, social ideal these days appear to be a person who is serious, polite, socially-acceptable and is into ""getting things done"" - but does not necessary tries his best to check the important things - much like book reviewers Feyman describes, who gave A rating to a book having nothing but empty pages. And later, such people become just ""pompous fools"". We all need to try staying as utterly honest as possible, and making it into key social norm, above all forms of pretense."
"1005",1004,"Jonathan Endersby","The most amazing thing about this book is how little it has to do with what he is so famous for. Instead it is filled with anecdotes that will make you laugh and then make you think. Somewhere between the samba band and the Japanese geishas Richard manages to impart some serious wisdom that changed how I think about the world."

"1011",1010,"Aneece","Feynman served, along with Henry Higgins from My Fair Lady, as my early role model for how to be a man."
"1012",1011,"Nguyên Duy Phạm","This would be the best autobiography you've ever read.It definitely was for me.Richard Feynman wrote about his life in the same way you would sit down with a friend over a coffee after a long time apart and just spill over what has been going on in your life: Mr. Feynman talked about his childhood, his school days, math, physics, the Manhattan Project, the Nobel Prize, how to draw, how to play drums, how to gamble, how to pick locks, how to flirt with girls at bars, how to educate, how to inspire kids, how to masterfully troll the rich and the prideful and the fools and the gullible and the people who are in theory smarter and wiser than you.As you can see, Mr. Feynman was a life-long learner with a life-long curiosity for new things and new skills.Long story short, Richard - or Dick (as he preferred) - Feynman was a legit magnificent bastard. And this book was a magnificent ride."
"1017",1016,"Umesh","The autobiographical accounts of Mr. Feynman are witty and insightful. They provide a glimpse of Feynman's adventures with regular people - Most of the stories are commonplace, but Feynman's curiosity, intelligence and funny attitude turn them into adventures. About Mr. Feynman, he enjoyed his life by doing things that he mostly loved. I liked his ""cut the crap"" attitude. I did not get surprised by the fact that he was multi-talented in various forms of arts and music as he was a great learner. Many scientists are multi-talented, but his showmanship was rare. Probably he was a bigger showman than Einstein, and that was a killer combo!The book is easy to read. Enjoyed reading all the chapters!"

"1032",1031,"Andrew Neal","Feynman was a genius (not like, oh, that guy's a genius, but like, no, really, he was a legitimate genius), as well as a hilarious dude, which makes this collection of anecdotes about his life a fun and inspiring read.I don't understand science very well - I've tried his book Six Easy Pieces and I just don't find them easy - but I admire the man so much for his honesty, integrity, and curiosity. He's one of my heroes."
"1035",1034,"Francisco Escobar ","Además de compartirnos sus anécdotas hilarantes, Feynman nos da una lección de lo que se puede lograr mediante un pensamiento libre; es decir, aquel que se motiva por nuestras pasiones intelectuales y no por lo que ""debemos"" aprender.

"1042",1041,"Adolgushin","Absolutely gorgeous one from a great mind of 20th century. Gives insight into how Dick Feynman's brain was operating and how he made certain decisions in his life. It's amazing how he always used his geeky, scientific mind even in solving real life problems like finding a date or avoiding an unnecessary meeting.All of us could learn from his stubborn geeky attitude of trying to complete anything that got into his hands, trying to solve any puzzle that he takes upon, hating to give up in any situation (even learning to play african bongo drums).Lastly, I think I start seeing a trend: each great book written by an outstanding individual is a heck of a fun reading!"

"1048",1047,"Anjan","I'm left with the impression that Feyman lived a full life because he was comfortable and honest with himself. This is a book within which Feynman boasts about demonstratively proving to upperclassmen frat boys at MIT that it is actually quite possible to piss while standing on your head...As well as learn percussion in the favelas of Brazil, enjoying the freedoms of Las Vegas, and doing whatever it is that he feels is worth his time and conscious effort. In that way it reminds me Arnold Schwarzenegger's auto bio, two talented pragmatic individuals that didn't dither about questioning their decisions when tenaciously pursuing goals. Unlike Arnold's auto-bio Feynman continually mentions -absent self-conscious emphasis- that he is an idiot, under educated, acted like a fool, his cover was blown, he can't remember things, and he has benefited from a lot of luck. His ""hardwork"" is obscured because he was lucky enough to have the freedom to find and pursue things he enjoyed as ends in themselves instead of in service of a social or political goal. ""This is how I learned... drums, drawing, mayan astronomy, sensory deprivation..."" All the stories share a mindset that the world can be lived as an adventure and there are no optimal plays which we need to worry about divining and matching to our personal scores. "
"1052",1051,"Michael Brown","Feynman's stories are equally interesting and hilarious. From his work on the atom bomb to hanging out in topless bars, Feynman leads his life with little worry about the opinion of others. A must read!"

Completely accessible even to those without a significant background in Physics -- there's very little in the way of formulas and equations outside of a few clever arithmetic tricks. A total pleasure to read, and a window into one of greatest minds of all time. Can't wait to read his other stuff."
"1063",1062,"Camille","From safe cracking to deciphering Mayan hieroglyphics to helping build the bomb at Los Alamos, Mr. Feynman lived a very full and interesting life. It is written very casually and he will write about picking up a receptionist in the same paragraph as explaining complex mathematical theories. I enjoyed how he explained the difference between learned and applied knowledge. His curiosity was sparked by anything that he could not explain, whether it be how the human sense of smell compares to a bloodhounds or how to fix transistors on a radio. It was really cool to read about his experience at Los Alamos and how he communicated with his ill wife through secret codes. The book is a series of short stories making it an ideal read while you are working on another book!"
"1064",1063,"André Silva","I read this book when i was very young (12 years-old?) and i have to say it struck me as something great. Not the book in itself, but Richard Feynman. It was this book that made me a great student, and though i didn't follow his field (i liked physics but i was always much more interested and better at humanities) he inspired me in a way none of my teachers could. I remember, being in a small portuguese town, that me and a friend who introduced Feynman to me, wondering how it would be to receive a Nobel prize or to have a PhD. Now, with 23 years-old, he's finishing med school and i'm a clinical psychologist preparing to enroll for a PhD in experimental psychology. And when i think of it, it's interesting to know that all this interest, all this need for science and enlightenment came from those pages in a book that is now lying in my bookshelf. May this book strike you in the way it stroke me. "
"1066",1065,"Sal4gal","This book was SO funny! I love biographies, history, and non-fiction but I know nothing of science. I purchased this book during a sale at Audible a while ago and it sat for a while before I started listening. What a surprise and a joy this book is. I didn't understand the tech jargon but I loved the insight into a brilliant brain and the humor and curiosity.We are amateur astronomers and we are always laughing at the lack of humor that the ""brains"" in the club are missing. I might be a bit insensitive, but academics sometimes are not blessed with a funny-bone. I was very sad when the book came to an end."

"1071",1070,"Derek Davis","God, do I love this man. That one of the grand physicists of the 20th century could be so completely human, so entertaining in off-the-cuff remarks, so side-splittingly funny, so genuinely self-deprecating yet as genuinely arrogant -- I don't know anyone like him, but I wish to hell I had known him while he was alive.As a Brooklyn Jew, he comes across as a melding of Jimmy Breslin and wacky Uncle Moshe. In rapid-fire recountings, complete with verbal sound-effects, he traces his upbringing, academic meanderings and total inability to accept formality and hypocrisy in the world. Growing up constantly unsure of himself, especially in the social world, he continually fell into situations in which he expected to blunder but found, because of his intense, around-the-corner way of viewing reality and his uninhibited need to experiment, that he almost always came out not just OK, but firmly on top:With no background in art, he blundered into drawing and ended up a respected painter. With no ability to read music and no idea of music theory, he became a leading figure in a Rio samba-school band and a whizz on African drums. Feynman was the perfect ad for ""just do it"" -- don't think about it, just do it.In his ""official"" career, he turned quantum mechanics on its side, if not its head, with truly innovative ways of viewing the most abstruse issues in physics. As a teacher, he gained the respect and love of his students. The e-version I read gives no hint of where, when or how the interviews took place that caught him in such a wide, receptive mood. Maybe he was always that way, but I'd love to know how they came about.What, in the end, did Feynman most want out of life? Considering the amount of time he gives to the topic, it may have been to get laid."
"1072",1071,"Rumen","Excellent book that makes you revisit basic things in life and re-evaluate. Surely Mr Feynman had a content life, considering that he was able to do such diverse subjects such as play bongo, learn to paint, learn foreign languages, safe-cracking etc etc, while at the same time excel at his core specialty/love i.e. physics and get a Nobel prize. Its a must read, preferably when you are still in school."

"1076",1075,"Thomas Simpson","Bongo roll for Fenyman. This man knows what life is about. It takes a masterful troll to live a life as interesting as he did...and get away with it. I guess being a tenured professor and winner of the Nobel Prize can help you with that. Makes me wonder if I'd enjoy math more if I did it in strip clubs. "
"1080",1079,"Peter Bythrow","This is the kind of thing my father had me read when I was young, and I wouldn't have wanted it differently. Feynman was the quintessential curious character, genius, physicist, musician, artist, amateur safe cracker, etc etc etc. In ""Surely You're Joking..."" and ""What do You Care What Other People Think?"" we're exposed to a bouyant personality who is driven by a desire to understand the world and the people in it; a person who is light hearted, adventurous, and never willing to compromise their belief in the wonder that exists around us all the time. Everyone would be a better person for reading this book. "
"1081",1080,"James Mcwilliam","Not strictly an autobiography, 'Surely You're Joking...' reveals more about Feynman's genius than any conventional blow-by-blow account of his life possibly could. It is hilarious, completely unbelievable and massive page-turner. Another thing worth noting is that, whilst occasionally referencing scientific principles, the work isn't burdened by them - so it is suitable for physicists and non physicists alike! Read this book!"
"1082",1081,"Jfox00","Loved this book"
"1086",1085,"Diogo","I can understand now why there is such a fan aura around Feynman's stories readers. He was a fascinating person in just about everything you can consider and I'd bet he's one of the most cited famous persons as ""Dead person I'd like to meet"". He'd try anything just to see if he could do it, and how far he could do it. How many scientists passed as a somewhat successful musician or painter, at a near-professional level (without actually applying all the necessary work for that)?The stories in this book are both hilarious and unbelievable. He was both an intellectual and social genius, the fraternity chapter is what I mean by ""social genius"". Great story. There isn't a logical sequence between the stories, but most of them are very interesting, enlightening, curious, hilarious... and this is just one set of his amazing stories. I can't wait to read more, and, for those interested in physics, his lessons are (probably) terrific from all I've heard."

"1105",1104,"Eric Elias"," Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman told by Richard Feynman is a book containing the famous physicist’s funniest and most exciting anecdotes. Feynman was a physicist who worked on The Manhattan Project and eventually became a professor. He is a very clever and determined person, which makes this book hilarious.	All of the stories made me laugh. For example, Feynman was trying to become an expert safecracker while he was working at Los Alamos. Eventually he knew how to unlock almost any safe. He said, “I opened the safes which contained all the secrets to the atomic bomb: the schedules for the production of the plutonium, the purification procedures, how much material is needed, how the bomb works, how the neutrons are generated, what the design is, the entire information that was known at Los Alamos: the whole schmeer!” (149). Feynman was able to break into these safes all by himself! This shows how funny this book is. Another funny moment is after Feynman had his physical before entering the army. The book read: “I started looking at the papers the psychiatrists had written, and it looked pretty serious! The first guy wrote:	Thinks people talk about him.	Thinks people stare at him.	Auditory hypnogogic hallucinations.	Talks to self.	Talks to deceased wife.	Maternal aunt in mental institution.	Very peculiar stare” (161) This book made me laugh every chapter.	Another reason this book is great is because it teaches you about science and math. One example is when he shows his classmates that French curves (stencils in a specific shape) are special because no matter how they hold it, the lowest point on the curve has a tangent that is horizontal. The book says, “They were all excited by this ‘discovery’- even though they had already gone through a certain amount of calculus and had already ‘learned’ that the derivative (tangent) of the minimum (lowest point) of any curve is zero (horizontal)” (36). This book has some humor, with some education along with it.	This book is great because it tells the adventurous stories of Feynman in a funny way. It also teaches math and science. The stories are very interesting and never kept me bored. This was a great read."

"1109",1108,"Zuza",",,Nebyl to žádný skrytý žert, co vyvolávalo jeho úsměv a ohníčky v očích, byla to fyzika.""Richard Feynman (1918-1988) byl americký fyzik, který v roce 1965 získal Nobelovu cenu. Kniha je jeho vyprávěním spousty (ve valné většině až neuvěřitelných) příhod ze všemožných oblastí života - dětství, studium, bádání, cestování, učení, seznamování se se ženami, vývoj atomové bomby a tak dále.Myslím, že na čtení není třeba být nějak víc vzdělán v oblasti matematiky nebo fyziky (kde se to překladateli zdálo vhodné/nutné, doplnil knihu poznámkami) a že všem můžu Feynmanovu knížku vřele doporučit :)Nemáte tip na něco podobného?- Říkali, že se proslavím, sotva tam přijedu, tím, že udělám nějakou hloupost. Takže jsem se snažil o trochu důstojnosti a váhavě jsem se vzdal myšlenky na přespání v té kupě listí.- Když se lidi spolu baví, začnou se vrtět a tak. Tenhle novinář zase okopával zarážku dveří, takže jsem řekl: ,,Ano, tohle je ta pravá zarážka ve dveřím zrovna sem."" Zarážkou byla čtvrtmetrová polokoule ze žlutého kovu - ze zlata, abychom byli přesní.Došlo k tomu takhle. Potřebovali jsme experimentálně zjistit, jak různé materiály odrážejí neutrony, aby nám neutrony neutíkaly pryč a nespotřebovali jsme příliš mnoho štěpného materiálu. Vyzkoušeli jsme spoustu různých látek. Zkoušeli jsme platinu, zinek, zkoušeli jsme mosaz a také zlato. A z testů se zlatem nám zbyly kusy zlata, načež někdo dostal chytrý nápad použít zlaté polokoule jako zarážky dveří v místnosti s plutoniem.- Začal jsem ten článek číst. V jednom kuse se tam mluvilo o extenzorech, flexorech, gastrocnemiálním svalu atd. Sem tam nějaké svaly byly sice pojmenovány, ale neměl jsem ponětí, kde se nacházejí vzhledem k nervům a kočce samotné. Šel jsem tedy do biologické knihovny a požádal knihovnici, jestli by tam neměla mapu kočky.,,Mapu kočky, pane?"" opakovala zděšeně. ,,Patrně myslíte anatomický obraz!"" Od té doby koluje pověst o jednom postgraduálním studentovi biologie mdlého rozumu, který sháněl ,,mapu kočky"".Když jsem přišel na řadu s referátem na toto téma, začal jsem s tím, že jsem namaloval obrysy kočky a začal vyjmenovávat různé svaly.Ostatní studenti mě hned zarazili: ,,Tohle všechno známe!"",,Jo, vy to znáte?"" povídám. ,,Pak se ovšem nedivím, že vám i bez čtyř let biologie klidně stačím!"" Promarnili celou tu dobu memorováním takovýchhle věcí, které si člověk může během patnácti minut vyhledat.,,Bylo mi nanic a vysilovalo mě, když jsem se musel v restauraci rozhodnout co si dám sladkého. Tak jsem se rozhodl, že to bude jednou provždy čokoládová zmrzlina, a už jsem si s tím nikdy nedělal starosti - tenhle problém jsem měl vyřešený.""(- In short, here is Feynman's life in all its eccentric glory - a combustible mixture of high intelligence, unlimited curiosity, and raging chutzpah.)"
"1112",1111,"Andrew Young","After reading Feynman, the comic book biography of Richard Feyman, I was rather interested in reading this autobiography. With my own background in chemistry and scientific research, I knew that I would enjoy hearing his philosophy behind his own research, but what I got was much more. This book allowed me to see inside the mind of one of the smartest man of the past century. Not only was he smart in terms of physics, but he excelled at most everything he put his mind to. With a never-ending curiosity, he learned how to do everything from samba to drawing to safe-cracking. I think that I would be great friends with this man, even though it sounds like he may be quite vain. It would also be difficult going to a bar with him, because it seems that he was quite the womanizer (although most people say they have more luck with women than they actually do). I appreciate his desire to understand concepts, instead of just knowing the concept itself. I think that this book should be a must-read for people in high school or atleast for those entering college. If only more people went about learning the way that he does, I believe we would have a much improved educational system and a more interesting social world.Takeaway:- ask why- don't be afraid to push through comfort zones- explain why something doesn't work, instead of only why it does- always stay interested- travel"
"1115",1114,"Charlie Whitney","Short narrative pieces that make up a fantastic life. Every time I picked it up it really stimulated my imagination.

"1122",1121,"Marian Willeke","Never did I know that such an absolutely brilliant person could be so funny ... and so incredibly diverse in his interests! Mr. Feynman is an inspiration to all scholars that not only is it completely fine to passionately love whatever it is that you love, but to remember there are other things in life to enjoy; yes, even pursue towards mastery. I had two major takeaways that personally impacted change in me. First, his intense curiosity. It's easy to slip into either a ""I'm too cool to be bothered with such things"" mindset, or a focused mindset that is too narrow to handle outside interests. Both limit our capabilities and potential. Second, his mindset towards theory development. Finishing my own PhD, I was struck with his comments on scientific integrity, and how we should seek to invalidate our own theories. Also, he noted that ""the idea is to try to give all the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another"". I do believe that all scholars are aware of that fact, but he really made it incredibly relevant with his own stories."
"1123",1122,"Saad Youssefi","Richard Feynman is the epitome of what it means for me to have lived an exciting life! So amazed by all his accomplishments and his personality. The big takeaway for me was how he was always just curious about everything in a very childlike, innocent way. Questioning everything and trying everything. From working on the atomic bomb to participating in a samba school to lead a samba school in Rio to learning how to pick up women at bars to winning the Nobel prize in Physics! He certainly is a extremely Fine-Man!!Real pleasure and inspiration! Laughed throughout the book!"
"1124",1123,"Nishant Totla","This is a short review. While I did always know the likable and amazing genius of Richard Feynman, I finally managed to read this book, after delaying forever. If there's one point I want to highlight here, it would be that Feynman was amazing not because of his intelligence or smartness (which are pretty great too), but because he was a straightforward thinker, a curious soul, and unbiased explorer. These are things I've partially thought about in the past myself, and have wanted to incorporate into my own life, and reading this book only gives me inspiration that I was right. In a very comical and fun way, he also debunks all the unnecessary and strange norms of behaviour and society. His vast range of interests and dedicated attempts to do well at everything interesting is also very inspiring."
"1125",1124,"Vivek Shilimkar","Great personality ever! So much to learn from a single man. He always did the things that he liked and not because of need. "
"1126",1125,"Tom Bane","Feynman demonstrated the philosophy of a life well-lived and this book captures his intellectual bravura as well as his overriding humanity, it takes the format of a collection of vignettes staged over the life of Feynman including his childhood, his time at Los Alamos on the Manhattan Project, his career as a trailblazing physicist as well as the tragic passing of his first wife, all the time you get a sense of the fun of living alongside him and his extraordinary mental faculties which forced some paradigm shifts in our understanding of twentieth century physics, at a time when particle physics was perhaps showing a tendency to ""tread water"". It spares us the gory details of equations and mathematics, meaning it's ridiculously easy to read. An engaging human interest story for science geeks and book lovers alike, by the end of the book you'll feel you know Richard Feynman and his life's work, there is nothing missing, a very well written book which makes you want to live as vivaciously as the man himself."

"1135",1134,"Akshay","I could almost not put this book down. Dr. Feynman was an incredible person, who I think has experienced almost all the things life has to offer. So many of his views resonate so strongly with me. Being a Graduate student, his book has already opened my mind to so many concepts of scientific thinking and learning by understanding. I think this will be the first non fiction book that I will add in my all time favorite book list. His take on life, work and enjoyment is something I wish to emulate and wish some of my friends emulated too. His fun loving attitude towards everything is one that more people in life should do. I am so glad I chose to start this book, and I recommend it to pretty much everyone."

"1143",1142,"James Tharpe","Full of hilarious and sometimes outrageous anecdotes, I was laughing out loud throughout each chapter. Feynman, as portrayed in this book, lived the way many of us would like to, but perhaps don't have the guts to. This book is really about his personal philosophy for life, which is described through personal parables and anecdotes rather than direct specification. Feynman comes across as good natured, brutally honest, and uncommonly curious. These core characteristics take him on many adventures, from safe cracker, to bongo player, to atomic bomb builder."
"1146",1145,"Sitzmak","I loved reading this book. Feynman was a great scientific genius of his time, but these memoirs reveal how human he was -- his love of learning, his prankster nature, and his interest in a great variety of subjects. I look forward to sharing this with my boys, when they are old enough for us to discuss his cavalier attitudes toward picking up ladies. Ah well - even the great have their faults and foibles. "
"1149",1148,"Jason Bergman","What a great book. This isn't an autobiography so much as a series of anecdotes from his crazy life. The whole tone feels like you're sitting next to him at a bar listening to these great stories. Feynman had a truly brilliant mind and unique personality. Highly, highly recommended."
"1153",1152,"Unearthly Child","One of the greatest characters in human history. And he was not imaginary. If I had a time machine, I'd choose being a part of at least a one of his numerous adventures."
"1155",1154,"Des Wie","Feynman helped invent the nuclear bomb alright, but his character can go no wrong in my fan eyes. This book was a great beginning to my journey of discovering a great scientist and a great man!"

"1166",1165,"Pasatoiu George","The world is filled with extraordinary people. Some of them stay hidden or keep a rather low profile, while others get all the fame and world appreciation. This is rather unfortunate, as we can't even imagine how much we lose by not knowing what all of these amazing people have to offer to the world. Go for a walk on the street and ask a random person if he ever heard about Einstein or Newton, and in the majority of time you we'll get an affirmative answer. They might even provide some clues related to their work and the importance of their discoveries. Ask them the same about Richard Feynman, and you'll probably get a confused look and no idea for an answer (unless the person you've just ask studied physics or has a good general knowledge).Before I started reading this book, I did know a little about Feynman, perhaps I even watched a couple of videos with or about him. I kind of knew that he was an atypical character, famed for his free spirit, but that's about all. Thanks to ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"", I have discovered one of the most interesting persons of the 20th century. He encompassed so many qualities one could search in a role model and some of his ideas or views on life I identify with. Sure, he was the boy genius of the 20th century physics and ended up winning a Nobel Prize in this field, but the book is not about his discoveries or a popularization of science. It just describes some of his best memories, as he recalls them, while offering his view on knowledge and teaching, art or picking locks. That's right, picking locks. Always on the search for learning something interesting, and finding a great pleasure in tricking other people, he developed a passion for puzzles and stuff like lockpicking and code breaking, that would allow him to jest with his colleagues or other persons. What seemed like a funny game sometimes brought his ""victims"" to despair, and as his fame grew some people were even trying to avoid him in fear of his pranks. Most persons appreciated him for his honesty, his ability to always speak his mind. Niels Bohr or some army generals would choose him from a group of scientists and ask for an opinion or advice because Feynman was not afraid to say what he was thinking. Once a conversation would start about science, everything else seemed to stop mattering and the truth was all that was left, even if it was a little harder to accept by the ones who started the discussion. His trip to Brazil is also relevant to this aspect. Displeased by the way students learnt there, he gave a speech that ended up changing an entire system. Even though he was satisfied with the idea of not knowing all the answers, he always pledged for a search of knowledge and truth. Not taking things for granted, without any evidence. He advised his students to keep their scientific integrity, and wished them to be in a place where ""you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.""But his affinities where not strictly related to science. He seemed interested in everything: to learn to play some instruments, to dancing or painting, even to discovering the wonders hidden behind hallucinations or some sort of out of body experiences. I particularly liked his view on alcohol or drugs: even though he wondered what the effect of some drugs would be, he claims that he never tried them because he likes to much to think and wouldn't want anything to affect that. On a similar situation are his relations to women and the chapters that describe some memories related to them are quite amusing. I really liked this book and how it presents this amazing person. That is exactly what books should seek: to present you places or people that will impress you, and that can have an impact on the reader and on the way he sees the world. And the more wonderful they are when they describe a real person, someone that loved life in all his aspects and never said no to learning something new. "
"1167",1166,"Menglong Youk","Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman is an autobiography of an accomplished physicist and a Nobel Prize winner Richard P. Feynman. We might judge him as a guy who was obsessed with physics and maths, we are partly right, but there were more. He was so curious about everything around him and liked to learn new skills. A long-ass of adventure, from learning to hypnotize, to cracking safes for fun, playing pranks on colleagues that spies had stolen the secret of atomic bomb, altering education system in Brazil, learning to speak Japanese, earning the skill in art which he had sucked at school, solving maths and preparing lessons in strip club, drawing women, expressing his love for music, and many more. I expected the book to be full of maths and complicated concepts of science, but no, I didn't see it coming. The ways he narrated his adventures are humorous and entertaining. Readers can enjoy the story of his journeys and learning life lessons at the same time from the man who spent most of his life interrogating what he wanted to know. I'm grateful that I chose this book as the first one among his others. I cannot wait to dive into his next masterpieces."
"1169",1168,"Lucija Vojnovic","Funny book about a very interesting man, full of anecdotes and inspiring thoughts.I read it in Croatian translations and I have to add that it seams it was not proofread at all - never before have I seen so many grammar and sentence structure errors in a single book, but I could not let that influence the book rating because it was really a great read. Although I would fire that proofreader (you can found out her name yourself :P)"

"1179",1178,"Jing Guo","unpretentious attitude, brilliant mindI have a simple mind. Therefore I like simple people. I like simple people with brilliant mind even better. That might be the biggest reason I like this book.Being one of the most distinguished physicists in 20th century and a Nobel Prize winner, Mr. Feynman surely has a brilliant mind. That is great, but doesn’t interest me as much. What makes me wonder is he sees the world like a child - he plays with physics, enjoys it, has lots of fun with it. When I read his anecdotes, I feel the same curiosity and energy I see in my 7-month-old Elizabeth: everything is fresh and new to her and you just can’t fake that. Mr. Feynman likes girls, he doesn’t hide it, he talks about how he learns about girls, understand them, making sense of their behaviors, he enjoys doing that just like he enjoys understanding the rest of the world.But you are mistaken if you think the anecdotes are trivia therefore of low value. Simplicity if powerful. Mr. Feynman is unpretentious, yet between his lines, you find his deep thoughts. His thoughts on why Brazil doesn’t have (any) physics education apply even today to many. His experience on debating over offers from Cornell and Caltech and his two lines of comment on that hit me like a rock.My biggest takeaway from the book? Simplicity is powerful. Be loyal to yourself. Of course, that’s my word. And Mr. Feynman’s word is much more fun. "
"1182",1181,"Sankara","Great book. "
"1183",1182,"Leippya","A fascinating read, and also surprisingly hilarious! I didn't expect to burst out laughing while reading the autobiography of a physicist but that's what ended up happening -- Feynman definitely was a first class prankster! Although physics are often mentioned, you don't need to really know about it to be able to enjoy the book; this is more about his life than his work. It's a joy to read about how much this man enjoys learning, not only physics but also music (bongo player!), painting and so on. Makes you just want to learn those things you've been postponing for a while. I cringed a bit at the way most women are represented in the book, but if that's how the women he met really were, there's nothing really to do about it, you can't rewrite history.I would really advise everybody to read this book. Feynman is a Nobel Prize winner, worked on the atomic bomb and is such an interesting and funny person to read about. Really, what I'm going to remember most from this book is how thoroughly that guy enjoyed life and embraced any challenge he set his mind on."
"1185",1184,"Daniel Judge","What an amazing collection of stories about Feynman. He is really engaging and lives the life we all want to live. I wish I had the chance to meet him in my earlier life and wish I would've found this book years ago.Favorite quotes:1. ""You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.""2. ""Ordinary fools are all right; you can talk to them, and try to help them out. But pompous fools - guys who are fools and are covering it all over and impressing people as to how wonderful they are with all this hocus pocus - THAT, I CANNOT STAND!"""
"1186",1185,"Brian Choi","Probably the only book I'll write a review for. This book changed my life and inspired me to study mathematics. On top of being one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century, Richard Feynman was a damn good writer and an overall incredible human being. Funny and poignant, this is my favorite book of all time. Highly recommended."
"1189",1188,"Bharath","If you ever want to understand the working of an analytical,totally unbiased, cool mind ,this is the book. Reading this book instills an attitude ,that might perhaps come with years of research. A priceless gem."
"1191",1190,"Byron","You can see why a generation of sketchy Internets businessmen are in love with this book. Richard Feynman was the OG haX0r, and in fact I think he actually did hack a computer back during the Manhattan Project era, when a computer was the size of a small building and you had to feed tape in it. He had that mentality that was all about figuring out ways to game the system, prank people and come up with novel solutions for problems. Sometimes this manifests itself in the form of brilliant scientific breakthroughs, and sometimes it's just goofy stories about trying to pick up chicks in bars. He's also just a masterful storyteller. These stories more or less span the course of the 20th century, and you can't help but get kinda verklempt once you get to the point where he can't have much longer to live . . . unless he's somehow found a way to cheat death."
"1193",1192,"Nikunj","This was such a delightful read, makes you fall in love with the Richard Feynman. Such a genius mind, such a playful mind....really loved reading this one. Gives you a great insight into the life & minds of one of the most brilliant personality of last century. Had fun!"

"1196",1195,"Frederik Creemers","A lot of reviews on this site say that Mr. Feynman sounds like a selfish man, who takes pleasure in the pain and misfortune of others. Ican certainly see how, but I really enjoyed his view on science and education."
"1197",1196,"Nory","Richard Feynman is a rare combination of intelligence and exuberance. The book gives a sense of both of these qualities. I found myself laughing aloud as I read it--an unusual quality for a nonfiction book."

"1214",1213,"Poornima","This is a delightful book! I would recommend it to everyone - to get introduced to a remarkable man. You don't need to know about science and physics to appreciate Feynman's intelligence, passion, open curiosity, thirst to learn anything and everything new, his unorthodox way of thinking. In one lifetime, how much can one man learn and do? If you are anything like Feynman, diverse and plenty (that's leaving aside the Nobel)! The book tells us accounts of Feynman - how he had an experimental laboratory at home as a child and also fixed radios; how he learnt to pick up girls; and how he learnt to pick locks; how he learnt foreign languages - Spanish/Portuguese/Japanese/Cantonese; how he learnt to play samba music and played in a carnival; how he learnt to sketch and actually put up his own art exhibition; how he played with Physics in day-to-day life; how he learnt numbers for fun; how his wife and he managed to circumvent the censorship at Los Alamos through codes; how he challenged the education board... In his words - pick up something and see how far he could go. Amazing stories! I, for starters, wish I had learnt my basics in science, physics and maths the way he did! "

"1217",1216,"Cathy Douglas","Feynman was a great scientist, but what stands out in his memoir is his try-anything attitude. He writes with an artless grace about the Manhattan Project, growing up as a nerdy Jewish kid, hanging out with bookmakers in a bar I wouldn't be caught dead in, playing bongo drums, science textbooks, and a whole lot more. This book, needless to say, covers a lot of ground. It's history and science, and it's funny as anything."

"1224",1223,"Jeff Yoak","I was first introduced to this book by a dear friend in college. Then it primarily amused me. While it is still incredibly amusing, its main impact upon me now is more inspirational. Below the level of a lot of amusing stories, you get a sense for a really incredible guy. I keep feeling, I'd like to be more like that.I admire Feynman's sense of fun, his curiosity and his basic sense of benevolence. Those things permeate each story and make for a great read."
"1225",1224,"Brennan","Feynman is one of the coolest people I've had the pleasure to read about. He's a safecracker, bongo drummer, nobel prize winner, ladies man, professor, physicist....it just goes on and on."
"1227",1226,"Bernd Schiffer","Very enjoyable stories in an autobiographic style. Feynman writes like he speaks, very direct and witty. There are a lot of great anecdotes in this book, like his famous analogy of cargo cult science. I find a lot of what he wrote very inspiring, e.g. (spoiler alert!)""You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.""“All the time you're saying to yourself, 'I could do that, but I won't,'--which is just another way of saying that you can't.”The book had it's lengths for me at the beginning, when he talked about his years as a kid and teenager, but his time when he was building the bomb and afterwards made up for that."
"1230",1229,"Cyndie","This book was hilarious. I am a biologist, and some of the technical physical stuff I wasn't familiar with, but it was totally relatable and the stories were interesting. It seemed like he was willing to try just about anything, it's a kind of life that would be fun to lead. Only drawback was I kind of expected him to have spent a bit more time talking about how horrible it was to have been part of creating nuclear weaponry. Would definitely recommend the book to others, even if you don't think of yourself as a ""scientist"". "

"1235",1234,"Lance Greenfield","Brilliant, inspirational and very funny! There can be no argument that Richard P Feynman was a genius. He has been a hero of mine since I was very young, probably because my father also greatly admires him and spoke to me about Feynman and his unique personality from time to time.There are some great stories in this book and they will make you laugh out loud. Feynman was always so full of life and he was curious about absolutely everything from a very early age. He would always want to know, ""How does that work?"" or ""Why is that the way it is?"" or ""Is there another way to do that?"" He would also latch onto something and decide that he wanted to do it, and to do it really well. For example, witnessing the bongo-playing in Brazil inspired him to learn to play like that and not like some studio-taught purist. He achieved it through dedication to his objective and sheer passion.What made Feynman a genius? Well, there were lots of factors that contributed to his status, many of them discussed in other reviews of this book, but, my reason for putting him into that classification was that he was capable of explaining the most complex of matters to a five-year-old. That is TRUE genius.I have read this book many times. It is a short book and will remain amongst my collection until the day that I die. If you haven't read it already, you should. You really need to read this book. I can guarantee that it will change at least one aspect of your life!"

"1249",1248,"L","One of the most inspirational books I have read lately. Apart from being one hilarious ride with an adventurous theoretical physicist, this book also reminded me of somewhat forgotten ways of learning, thinking and experimenting in life and academics/career. Feynman comes across as an honest, courageous, fun-filled character who had certain child-like innocence and curiosity in his spirit. The writing will make you laugh, wonder and think. Feynman's free-spirited nature, his attitude of questioning status-quo, his insatiable curiosity, his will to step out of his comfort zone and try new and often difficult things is inspiring, to the extent that one would want to break their present monotonous life and set out for their own adventure!This book demands a permanent place in your library and re-reads."

Nowadays there are really few people who would bring that in discussion or try to point out the problems, because it is socially- unacceptable - but Feynman was never so dependent on the opinion and norms of the society, he was interested only what was effective for it."

Cred că principiile după care, nu numai că se ghidează în viață, ci și le practică în mod consecvent, ar trebui să ni le asimilăm cu toții.Din rândurile scrise cu mult umor, aflăm cum în viața de zi cu zi încearcă mereu să fie onest și integru față de sine însuși și, implicit, față de ceilalți. Acest lucru îl face să aștepte, destul de natural, aceleași lucruri și din partea societății, ceea ce de multe ori îi sâcâia și nemulțumea pe cei din jur, încurcându-le socotelile. Aflăm cum tratează pasiunea centrală a vieții sale, fizica, ca pe un joc care merită făcut numai dacă există curiozitate și plăcere. Învătăm că, dacă ești autodidact și perseverent, poți ajunge bun în domenii în care nu ai nicio experiență (Feynman a învățat de la zero portugheza, să deseneze, să cânte la tobe și multe altele). Descoperim că nonconformismul său provine din faptul că îi plăcea să înțeleagă și să gândească fiecare problemă întâi singur, prin propriile puteri, pentru ca abia apoi să consulte părerile celorlalți. De aici și autenticitatea și creativitatea sa atât de abundente. Și, nu în ultimul rând, învățăm că înarmați cu umor și deschidere putem trata viața ca pe un joc, astfel încât să avem parte de o continuă aventură.Nu pot încheia decât afirmând cu entuziasm că mă bucur că mi-am găsit un nou model de urmat în viață!

"1281",1280,"Nate Poulsen","I forget whether this book or ""Why Do You Care What Other People Think"" was my first non-technical Feynman book (I started into ""Six Easy Pieces"" as a freshman, but was not yet enchanted by physics). Regardless, I read both in close proximity, and credit them, or rather, Feynman, with influencing on my choice to pursue a degree in physics. This book is part of a collection of Feynman's life stories that, while not technical, illustrate what it was about Feynman's personality that made him an outstanding scientist as well as such a popular one. While all of Feynman's books should be required reading for aspiring scientists, this book does not require a technical background (though it doesn't hurt to have one). Instead, the book illustrates Feynman's adventures, which can be appreciated by scientists and lay people alike. Certainly, in the book, Feynman comes off a little smoother than he actually was (friends indicate that his Nobel Prize /did/ actually mean quite a bit to him. However, Feynman isn't shy in sharing stories that make him look silly or foolish (though there are not too many) or lecherous. Regarding the last, this is probably a PG13 book. Also, my one slight criticism of the book, or rather, Feynman, is his almost rabid atheism (though apparently that tempered over time). Overall, a fun read."

His strong curiosity is what makes a difference between a great person who can create whatever he sets his mind on doing, and a random person who simply knows facts about art/science/news but can't use them to create or really understand anything whatsoever.The book is funny and clever. I absolutely loved it and will surely read it again at some point in my life!Here are some quotes that I really connected with:""And, just like it should in all stories about philosophers, it ended up in complete chaos.""""There were a lot of fools at the conference - pompous fools - and pompous fools drive me up the wall.

I love the way he imbibes the scientific way of thinking in every little thing he does, and his ever present learning attitude to see how far can he get in any field, not just physics.

Feynman once provoked the wife of a Princeton dean to remark, ""Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman!"" But the many scientific and personal achievements of this Nobel Prize-winning physicist are no laughing matter. In addition to solving the mystery of liquid helium, Feynman has been commissioned to paint a naked female toreador and asked to crack the uncrackable safes guarding the atomic bomb's most critical secrets. He has traded ideas with Einstein and Bohr, discussed gambling odds with Nick the Greek, and accompanied a ballet on the bongo drums. Here, woven with his scintillating views on modern science, Feynman relates the defining moments of his accomplished life."

His is a first rate scientific mind that never stops at anything unless he arrives at a conclusion that is satisfying and in accordance with common sense. What makes him different is the fact that he does not stop here but goes one step further to ensure that he does communicate this in the most simplest fashion possible. It is a book long glimpse to the mind of a funny, intelligent and humane persona that made up Richard Feynman.What strikes you most about him is his utter lack of pretension. For a man who won a Nobel, worked on the Manhattan project and has a string of achievements in the field of physics to his credit, he is entirely unassuming. He assumes the same air of fun and gaiety in discussing the Manhattan project as he does on how to flirt with the showgirls in Vegas. This is a no holds barred account of his life and a detailed elucidation on some of his thoughts and perspectives. If I was asked to pick what stood out of this book, I would pick the attribute of curiosity. You do not need a sharp mind to pick out the number of times he tinkers around to find the underlying truths all because it got him curious. The second aspect is that he never shied away from learning all through his life. From what I can recollect right now, he went along and studied how to make music at a Brazilian Carnival, how to gamble like a high roller, how to play bongo drums, how to be interesting to women without emptying your pocket in the process and so on. If you look at these things he learned, they have nothing to do with science but that never stopped him. All that mattered to him was the learning and how to be good at what you learn. It baffled me to see that he could manage to learn so much in one single lifetime. Feynman was never the highbrow kind to spurn all these as beneath him but he embraced all these as the little things that make our World fun to live in. Feynman was above everything else an epitome of irreverence. Social niceties never sat well with him and he was the kind to call a spade its real name, in the loudest way possible no matter what the occasion was . Bureaucracy was what suffered his wrath the most through pranks and vociferous protests. Here is what he had to say about the ruling elite and its policies :  I know it is the way the Government works ; well screw the Government ! I feel that human beings should treat human beings like human beings. And unless I am treated like one, I'm not going to have anything to do with them.  These acts of rebelliousness chose to make him a kind of social pariah, but Feynman being Feynman cared not two hoots about it !This is no biography but an exploration of things that caught his interest from everything ranging from Mayan hieroglyphics and quarks to hallucinations and good looking girls. A very interesting set of anecdotes about a rather unique human being. Recommended. "
"1338",1337,"Nikhil Sharma","Feynman is just the limit a person can reach when he aspires to be both a physicist and an adventurer simultaneously. This is so far the best biography i have ever read. Full of witful jokes, emotions and a journey of a human which seems more like a science fiction."

"1383",1382,"Peter Frazier","This amusing little book of anecdotes had an alarmingly influential role in my life. It convinced me of the odd notion that it would be a good idea to go to Caltech and major in physics. In retrospect, this would have been a better idea had I been born around 1930 and was starting my scientific career around 1940, but nowadays it's a tough slog in physics, both money-wise and also discovery-wise. I think that people like Bohr and Planck and Einstein and Feynman discovered all the good stuff in physics and that future theory will be more difficult and less beautiful (though perhaps these string-theorists put my foot in my mouth). I wish I had realized all this when I was 17 rather than 24, but all is not lost: physics is wonderful training for all manner of mathematical disciplines, and all has worked out for the best. I retain a deep fondness for this book, and rereading old passages brings me comfort. If you ever have the choice between reading this book and doing something productive and worthwhile, I recommend that you read this book. All will work out for the best for you too."
"1387",1386,"Nick Sologoub"," It's an amazing book. Starting a little bit boring, but gets much better later. I think that some parts of this book should be given to children in school to inspire scientific thinking and general interest to science. "

He should have been awarded a prize bigger than the Nobel Prize for being the character he was!I enjoyed the whole book very much. Somehow, I ended up highlighting some random sentences/paragraphs in the book.""I never drank ever again, since then. I suppose I really wasn’t in any danger, because I found it very easy to stop.

"1439",1438,"srdjan","I love Feynman."
"1450",1449,"Peter Kjer hansen","Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" is a very well written book, which gives a picture of what kind of human being Feynman was. It doesn't focus on physics but instead on different stories from his life - Some very funny, others interesting, and others again actually discussing some pretty serious issues. All of the stories have some kind of depth to them, which is nice and adds depth to the book. The way the book is structured is very clever because some of the more serious stories, where Feynman can come off as kind of an angry, old man, is placed in the books final chapter. At this point we've already gotten a pretty good picture of who Feynman was and we understand why he acts this way, meanwhile if it was in the beginning of the book, it would most likely have been a turn off to some readers - Who wants to read about a person who is merely pissed off?Overall, the book is very entertaining and I highly recommend reading it."
"1453",1452,"Odanga","This book truly unravels the genius of Mr. Feynman. I struggled to put the book down, right from the beginning.The book truly sheds light into the kind of man Feynman was: special. He was the anti-stereotype the kind of life a physicist lives(in a good way). He was a first class scientist who derived his happiness from discovery and invention yet outside the scientific world he was just hilarious. I would recommend it to anyone who is literate."
"1454",1453,"Undrakh Ganzorig","Very unlikely biography for a theoretical physicist. One may expect it to be full of theories and experiments, but this guy talks about things like learning a musical instrument in a local band of Brazil or stealing a door of fraternity house. I don’t think an autobiography can be more honest and funny (oh, his sense of humor!) Mr. Feynman kept claiming that learning certain things took time, energy, hard work, and above all Curiosity! At some point, we just stop wondering about things around and prefer to live in a life of routine and safety, but he never stopped wondering at all the phenomenon of the world. He leads to the questioning of validity of our knowledge. I wonder if I ever studied or will study something with intensity and interest as Mr.Feynman had in studying physics. Highlights:-“…they didn’t put two and two together. They didn’t even know what they ‘knew’ ”-“People often think I’m a faker, but I’m really honest, in a certain way- in a way that often nobody believes me”-“If the idea looked lousy, I said it looked lousy. If it looked good, I said it looked good. Simple proposition. I’ve always lived that way. It’s nice, it’s pleasant- if you can do it. I’m lucky in my life that I can do this”-“…they could pass the examinations, and ‘learn’ all this stuff, and not know anything at all, except what they had memorized” -“I’ll never make that mistake again, reading experts’ opinions. Of course, you only live one life, and you make all your mistakes, and learn what not to do, and that’s the end of you”-“I understood at last what art is really for, at least in certain respects. It gives somebody, individually, pleasure. You can make something that somebody likes so much that they’re depressed, or they’re happy, on account of that damn thing you made! In science, it’s sort of general and large: You don’t know the individuals who appreciated it directly”-“Ordinary fools are all right; you can talk to them, and try to help them out. But pompous fools-guys who are fools and are covering it all over and impressing other people as to how wonderful they are with all this hocus pocus-THAT, I CANNOT STAND! An ordinary fool isn’t a faker; an honest fool is all right. But a dishonest fool is terrible! ”-“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself-and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you’ve not fooled yourself, it’s easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that”"

"1474",1473,"Cole","- This is a book of lessons that really should be read more than once to fully absorb.- Number one: Take nobody’s word for it. Work the answer out for yourself. This gives you a deeper understanding of the subject and a better way to apply what you know. - Dissect a concept till you know exactly what it says; if can’t say it in common english, you probably don’t know what you’re talking about (especially if you haven’t explicitly defined your terms)- Look for the adventure in figuring things out. This passion for knowledge fueled all of feynman’s adventures. He loved to experience things, not just hear about them. Apply your knowledge so you can grasp the principles, not just the methods.- Wonder about the world. Think of why things are. Try and figure out if you can solve the puzzle, and challenge others to do the same.- When you go to Japan, ""be in Japan as much as possible"". This applies to everything you do.

"1482",1481,"Vishank","A beautiful collection of interesting anecdotes. A window to peep into the world or Dr. Feynman and how he explain the beauty of this universe using science. Truly amazing"
"1485",1484,"Jim Steiner","Richard P Feynman was a very unique and extraordinary man. As I rapidly devoured this book, his ability to tell the wonderful stories of his life were a great source of entertainment and insight. The novel (it seems part autobiography, part life philosophy manual) progressed more or less chronologically. He highlights the laboratory of his childhood, higher education, working on the Manhattan Project during WWII, becoming a (non-stereotypical) professor, life journeys to Brazil and Japan, and many other exciting adventures.I get the sense that this man was a happy realist. He experienced the world with ""A Different Box of Tools"" and genuinely loved life. Aside from his contributions to science and technology, Mr. Feynman showed the world how to UNDERSTAND, how to live life to the fullest, how not to fool yourself, and how not to be fooled by others.If you enjoyed the book or wish for a taste of his style, Richard Feynman has many lectures and interviews floating out there in cyberspace. He was a great teacher and great speaker. He has a way of communicating and getting you to really question the question in order to find deeper meaning of the subject at hand."

This book is an inspiration to me as a scientist to work harder and to be more well rounded."
"1491",1490,"Antonio Martín","An amazing... way of thinking. Read it and get crazy."
"1492",1491,"Sai Kumar","A lovely collection of anecdotes especially during the Manhattan project narrated by the genius himself. Feynman was popular due to his application of physics in daily life so simplistically that it made everyone think he was a magician. In this book the man himself shows the human side of himself, how he faltered, how he recovered, how he went about his life, very lucidly as a collection of stories. What amazes you is even when he was a part of such a top secret project he played around and had fun and also got serious work done at the same time. The little kid inside him could be an inspiration to all of us to emulate."

For people like me that loves popular science this is really a good read. "
"1501",1500,"Danelley","This book is a HOOT! And physics-lite, for you physics-phobes out there. I was really interested to hear about the old computers the scientists used at Los Alamos to do their numerical integration and calculations and how they would run these computing cards through the ""computer"" for months on end to get an answer. And then, of course, Feynman began to innovate and find faster ways to do things. This book helped me remember to cherish that child-like fascination with how things work and discovery!"

"1507",1506,"Manny","Everyone has a collection of favorite stories that they enjoy telling; but it's unusual for the stories to be so good that a friend insists on writing them down, so that other people can appreciate them too. When I read this book, I almost feel that Feynman's telling the stories himself. Well, when that happens in real life, you always want to join in; here's my personal best effort at a Feynman-type anecdote. I hope it's now far enough in the past that the people concerned will see the funny side, if they happen to stumble across this page by accident!STAR TREK AND THE PERSONAL SATELLITE ASSISTANTIt was early 2000, and I had just started working at NASA Ames Research Center in California. I was part of this little group that was supposed to be developing spoken language dialogue systems for space applications. The guy whose idea it was had started up the group, recruited me and two other people, and then left to join Microsoft Research before I'd even arrived. So everyone was looking at us suspiciously. Why did NASA need software that you could talk to?The rest of this review is available elsewhere (the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons)"

"1513",1512,"Victor Hugo","I think Mr. Feynman expresses the feeling of commitment with science - and how it is spread through the world - really well in his book. That said, the book also tells amazing stories from Feynman's days - most of them out of the university space - that will make you laugh out loud, showing a person who does not care so much for labels created by the people. It was amazing to read his insights about the way our world is organised, and I was really upset as I was seeing the book was ending.This book really blew my mind. Definitely a must read for every human being."
"1514",1513,"MA Deviah","You don't have to be into science to read this delightful book on Feynman's adventures in physics. You just need to be into life!"
"1517",1516,"Bernard","A very inspiring book. Feynman's passion and curiosity enabled him to lead a happy and interesting life. As demonstrated by this book, he never lost his sense of whimsy. If I have a life with half as many stories as Feynman's, I will consider it to be a full life. "
"1523",1522,"Idontread doyou","Awesome!"
"1524",1523,"Barclay Brown","The best, and perhaps the only book about Feynman's life itself. It's as close to an autobiography as there is, taken from his various notes, conversations, etc. Simply awesome. Also look up the Nova special ""The last journey of a Genius""!"

"1530",1529,"Landon Wilkey","This is definitely one of my favorite books. Richard Feynman is such an interesting character and there's a lot that can be learned from him. He also pulls many zany antics which makes the book all the more fun to read. "
"1531",1530,"Viktor Davion","I really enjoyed these memoirs. Some could call Feynman a trickster, some probably doesn't like his attitude to people. But I can't deny his thirst for knowledge and experiment (and mischief too though). If these stories won't be so funny book probably could be boring. I didn't wait any revelations from it, but I got some interesting ideas from author though. I was astonished with his curiosity and somewhat his naivety (in scientific sphere). I think probably this naivety helped him to keep his thirst for knowledge, his almost childish passion with science. In conclusion I can't recommend it for every one. Some could say this book is shallow, just some loosely connected stories. Well, yes, but these stories are fun and bonded with ultimate love to science."

"1543",1542,"EmaLee Sault","If you've ever found yourself questioning social norms, have a love for science, or just enjoy a goofy story, this is the book for you! This quirky novel by Physicist, Richard Feynman, gives readers some insight into how the mind a genius works. Little anecdotes of Feynman's life are written in choppy thought bursts, much like how Mr. Feynman was said to speak and teach. I found myself belly laughing at his dorky stories, for he is the type of genius who doesn't marvel at his greatness- he's hardly aware of it! As he struggles to learn social cues, and solves impossible puzzles, he astounds all who he meets. He jokes, plays clever tricks and even gets a few girls. This is a charming book, by a lovely man. "

"1548",1547,"Grumpus","If not for copyright laws, this book could easily have been entitled, “Oh, The Places You’ll Go!”. This is a captivating story of an amazing life that could not have been better had it been scripted at birth.Mr. Feynman has done it all. I loved the feeling of tagging along on this brilliant, Nobel-prize winning physicist’s life. A little eccentric yes, but the narrative flows in a very conversational manner (which is a style I like very much). From his early life, to his work on the atomic bomb, to his ability to crack safes, I could not help but admire his chutzpah and proven success. This ""nerd"" even had tremendous success with the ladies. Therefore, on behalf of nerds everywhere, you are our hero!He, like Robert Todd Lincoln, was always lucky enough to be at the right place at the right time in history. The difference is that Feynman tended to be around for the more auspicious historical events. Truly, there are not enough adjectives to describe his amazing talents, admirable life, and impressive success. Among the many biographies I’ve read, only one other person gets this summation, “Remarkable...a life well lived.” That person? Abigail Adams"

RPF not only held it, he had a firm grasp and unsurprisingly he excelled at what he did.The book is written in a fun way and entertains with the turn of every single page (or every tap of screen for e-books).

"1575",1574,"Glenn","I received this book from Schuyler for my 24th birthday. I didn't really know who Richard Feynman was, but now am a huge fan of the Nobel laureate physicist. Feyman takes a stroll down memory lane in and is able to tell many remarkable stories from his life with a humble voice. In addition to a touch of genius in physics, Feynman also found himself an accomplished biologist, mechanical engineer, safe cracker, drummer and artist. His grounded perspective on life brings humor to almost every story (which suspiciously includes him being the clever antagonist) - the book is hard to put down. A light read, and a lot of fun."
"1578",1577,"Rishita Paruchuri","A frank and open revelation by the genius himself. One of the greatest scientists of our times, it is amazing to know what a versatile character he was! Very interesting read. Keeps you hooked till the end!"
"1584",1583,"Snafoo","Oh what joy."
"1585",1584,"Nick Urban","This book is very funny, a great tale of adventure, and also strangely heartwarming."
"1589",1588,"Robert Vlach","Po pár letech kniha, která mě úplně dostala, jako čtenářský zážitek! Na jednu stranu jde o anekdotickou sbírku kuriózních zážitků fyzika Richarda Feynmana, jehož seriózní životopis jsem tu nedávno doporučoval. V hlubší rovině je však jedinečnou sondou do duše nevídaně zvídavého a chytrého člověka, která s vámi může pohnout nečekaným směrem. Při čtení knihy se mi spojilo hodně věcí, osobních i vědeckých. Přitom je ale obrovská legrace a zábava, když s Richardem můžeme sdílet jeho nadšení z poznávání a neuvěřitelné historky, které ho, zdá se předcházely i provázely na každém kroku, i když šlo o tak nežertovné věci jako projekt sestrojení atomové bomby. To nemyslíte vážně, pane Feynmane! je s přehledem jedna z nejlepších knih, jaké jsem četl. Nejen pro svůj ostrovtip, ale zejména pro neopakovatelný způsob, jakým dokázala přiblížit zdánlivě chladný svět fyziky rovině laškovného vyprávění. Smál jsem se u ní rád a na celé kolo! Jako anglická audiokniha s výraznou humornou dikcí neměla chybu."
"1590",1589,"Swathi Chatrapathy","What a pleasant read! This book made me guffaw every few minutes. I love Feynman! His honest, unapologetic and sometimes, downright snobby behaviour is absolutely delightful! I really like how at least one word in every hundred is italicised, stressing on things here and there. Such expressive writing. I would recommend the book to anyone who likes intelligent and charming people. (Oh there's a lot of science and math in the book! Be warned.)"
"1591",1590,"Brett Stortroen","Very interesting autobiography. So many great kernels of wisdom and insight.I love his story of how he watched the first atomic bomb by standing behind a windshield. He knew the glass would block all the dangerous UV light and was likely the only one who actually saw the blast's full effect. Most witnesses did not look or used super dark glasses which blocked most of view.Feynman had so many funny stories which made the book a great read!"
"1593",1592,"Young","This was recommended reading for one of my engineering classes. What a great story about a genius. Hilarious, down-to-earth, brilliant, witty, and simply entertaining. If you have any interest in science, physics, or Richard Feynman, I highly recommend this book. "

"1604",1603,"Antonio Segura","Entertaining stories and insight to the thinking of a remarkable man. "
"1605",1604,"Katharine","I LOVE Richard Feynman. This is his first book of personal anecdotes of his incredibly interesting life. He was a man driven by a child-like curiosity, which led him to make amazing strides in physics and eventually win a Nobel Prize in physics.He was not only a successful scientist, but also picked up Brazilian drumming, drawing, lock-picking, dream-control and much more. He inspires me to be curious about...everything! Even if I don't have his brilliant mind to fully analyze it."
"1608",1607,"Lavinia Petrache","I had soooo much fun reading this book! It's as if you're sitting in a room with Feynman and you're just randomly telling stories. Very natural, very rich, inspiring and, well, what I enjoyed the most of course, his views of life felt often times aligned with mine, so what's not to love about that? :PThis is a man who knew how to live and how to find beauty in everything he did. His strong curiosity is what makes a difference between a great person who can create whatever he sets his mind on doing, and a random person who simply knows facts about art/science/news but can't use them to create or really understand anything whatsoever.The book is funny and clever. I absolutely loved it and will surely read it again at some point in my life!Here are some quotes that I really connected with:""And, just like it should in all stories about philosophers, it ended up in complete chaos.""""There were a lot of fools at the conference - pompous fools - and pompous fools drive me up the wall. Ordinary fools are all right; you can talk to them, and try to help them out. But pompous fools - guys who are fools and are covering it all over and impressing people as to how wonderful they are with all this hocus pocus - that, I cannot stand!""""[...] I was in Italy for a science conference and I thought I'd like to see the Sistine Chapel. I got there very early in the morning, bought my ticket before anybody else, and ran up the stairs as soon as the place opened. I therefore had the unusual pleasure of looking at the whole chapel for a moment, in silent awe, before anybody else came in."""
"1609",1608,"Kate Z","I love this book and pick it up to reread fairly often when I'm home at my parent's house. Totally nerdy but also hilarious."
"1611",1610,"Mandy","Yay!"
"1612",1611,"Borys","Oh I love this book! It's 5+ stars for me, favorite shelf.. you get the idea! I read some negative reviews here and I have to agree, Feynmann probably was a freak in some senses, but he was not mean, nor unkind, nor cunning, he was just a freak (or curious character in his own words :)). And I love freaks, I love people who are not afraid to think and try and do. What I was fascinated with was his personality, his love to play with things, to discover new ways of doing stuff, his interest in learning different subjects quite removed from the field of physics, so many things actually.Highly recommended to anyone. Do not be afraid to read, not much physics there going on, rather life of a brilliant guy."
"1614",1613,"Jeff Brateman","Mr. Feynman was a character. His stories made me laugh and I kept thinking, ""Why didn't I think of that?"" "
"1615",1614,"Menno Vanfrachem","Absolutely loved it!This book talks about a scientist as a human and does a good job conveying the passion he has for his profession. I really liked that he talked about The Manhatten Project in a playful way, making it al lseem fun (as it probably was) and later realizing how influential, and dangerous, their work had been."
"1621",1620,"Kartik Singhal","This is one of those books which bring a turning point in your life, and make you reevaluate it, much like Randy Pausch's The Last Lecture and Steve Jobs bio for me. Made me take interest in physics around us again. :)Feynman was surely a man of multiple lives, how could anybody live so much? Physicist, safe cracker, artist, frigideira (an instrument used in Samba music) player, nobel prize laureate, drummer, and more. His mischievous nature and varied interests (exploration of hypnotism and sense deprivation, e.g.) were inspiring in a way.As a scientist, he leaves out important messages primarily in the chapters: O Americano, Outra Vez! (later part, pg. 211 onwards, about state of science education in Brazil at the time); Is Electricity Fire? (on Jewish (dis)interest in science); Judging Books by their Covers (review of school math books, and disappointment obtained from them); and lastly, Cargo Cult Science, the last chapter.A must read for any science-loving person."
"1623",1622,"Vencislav Popov","Mr. Feynman shows such innocent exuberance in talking about science and his life that one cannot help the desire to go out in the world, kneel in the grass and study something, anything just to share the joy, the pleasure, of finding things out. This is the story not of a nobel laureate, but of a remarkable individual with a limitless thirst for knowledge and adventure."
"1632",1631,"Avik","This book single-handedly turned me towards a career in scientific research. I read a threadbare copy borrowed from a friend's brother when I was in the final year of high school, and what I learnt has outstayed anything that I have learnt from science textbooks throughout my student (and now professional) life. This book has an amazing motivational capacity; that science can be fun and scientists pranksters were unknown to most of us leading a humdrum student life in a congested, humid city in India. The anecdotes, while fascinating, also throw enough light on the character of the remarkable protagonist and his sweeping world-view. Right from his famous safe-cracking episode at Los Alamos to spending a night at a brothel together with Freeman Dyson to escape driving through flood and discussing QED - Feynman shares it all here. I have read a lot about Feynman and his science (papers, to be precise) and I can safely vouch that this book stands head and shoulders above any other memoir of a scientist. A must read for people in need of motivation for a career in science and also for those who think scientists are nerds!"
"1636",1635,"Sierra","What a fun, light (excluding the math and physics) book. If only I could look at life and puzzles through Professor Feynman's eyes..."
"1639",1638,"Cagri","Fascinating!!!"
"1643",1642,"Sean Eddy","One of the greatest and most entertaining reads to ever come out of a Nobel prize winner."

Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman
 by Richard P. Feynman is one of the best memoirs that I have ever read in my lifetime. The book itself is a collection of short and curious adventures that had taken place in his life. In this sense, there is no real beginning, middle, and end (or many of them if you want to view it in a certain sense) so it was very easy to pick up and read a chapter or two daily.I personally, really enjoy this kind of writing style. His sporadic stories scattered all over the place may seem very confusing and annoying to others but I think that people naturally think this way. One story reminds you of something else, which reminds you of something else, something that we see in our daily conversations. This unique way of writing really appealed to me. One thing that people have to understand is that Mr. Feynman is a person of science and some people may not fully understand his curiosity of things relating to science. Mr. Feynman is a good prankster and a person who's natural qualities include playfulness, but you need to appreciate science and the world around you to fully understand him.Although I consider it a great book, I wouldn't recommend it to that many other people. I feel most people would consider Mr. Feynman a condescending and random character, and there is some truth to that. I would recommend it to people who like this kind of writing style as well as people who are OK with him calling other people dumb (which I believe he is fully correct). I also think that there is an extreme amount of truth in this book. I could imagine some memoirs to sugarcoat a lot of things, Mr. Feynman doesn't do anything of the sort. Not to say that he is open to all the dark secrets to his life. For instance, Mr. Feynman had multiple wives yet he never really talked about the divorces he had with them (although he did talk a little bit about the his first wife's death). Mr. Feynman speaks the truth in what he writes and only writes what he wants to write.In the end, I considered it to be a great book of curious adventures, but I don't think that everyone will enjoy it the same way that I do. I would suggest that you pick up the book and read a chapter or two to see if your OK with his writing style. If you are, I think that you would like the book a lot."
"1648",1647,"Dan Coya","Amazing. Must get this book on audible. So fun to listen to. I can't imagine trying to read this because of the unique way Feynman wrote it. "
"1649",1648,"Liesl","Recommended by my oldest brother when solicited for inspiring reads and this really delivered. Seriously entertaining. This guy was a literal genius, a nobel prize winner, a truly independent thinker with a brilliant mind and a zest for finding answers to questions that would never occur to my thick head. I wish I had him as a science teacher. It would definitely have changed my interest and awareness of everything around me. A gem of a book. Hope kids read this in school. I know I wish I had."
"1654",1653,"Hayes","I remember loving this book, but not much else. To re-read soon."
"1655",1654,"mstan","Irrepressible. And I hated physics in school (probably the fault of the curriculum as well as my own limitations)."
"1656",1655,"JT Neville","Again Mike Kelly rears his ugly mug but this time for aplomb in recommending authors to read. Feynman wasn't just a great physicist, he was a great man. Reading about him, peoples remembrances and his writings is simply eye-opening. This first one covers his solution to the Challenger disaster, his bongo playing, lock picking and many other intertaining and insightful anecdotes."
"1657",1656,"Ninad  Pethkar","juz fantastic......Must read "
"1659",1658,"Sergej Müller","Brilliant book. I love this guy."
"1667",1666,"Jiu","Feynman rocks!"
"1671",1670,"Sathon","This book is amazing! Feynman's sense of humor and humility makes him my superhero role model. I LOL'd on sooo many occasions. Feels like reading a real life James Bond story!"
"1672",1671,"Mrugesh Karnik","Fantastic, absolutely fantastic!From siphoning ants away from food to defining hard core science; while learning techniques to picking up girls in a bar and playing bongo with a ballet; this book is a fabulous journey - start to finish! An absolute cracker!Frolicsome, yet enlightening. This is an absolutely must a read. If you pay good attention, you'll learn valuable lessons as well. Do not miss out on reading this one."
"1674",1673,"Sabina","A very inspiring man. A really interesting book about him."
"1675",1674,"Marvin","Easy to read, and you learn some science as well."
"1677",1676,"Lucka","Smart, yet funny and easy to read."
"1678",1677,"GiM","The subtitle tells it all Adventures of Curious Character.Yeah he probably had great ego, so what."
"1679",1678,"lilly","I had a feynman crush reading this book. His curiousity, hackery, and unpolished narrative flow all charmed me. Then Robin told me that he would reveal himself to be a chauvinist by the end of the book. I have yet to hit that part, but I'm not excited about it. Oh, and http://xkcd.com/c182.html"
"1680",1679,"Jake Berlin","after reading this, i think i would give my left toe to have known dick feynman. holy crap this guy is amazing. it's not so much that the book is a sparkling literary achievement (it's not); it's that it (a) chronicles an incredibly amusing and diverse series of events, and, in doing so, (b) conveys an unparalleled and overwhelming combination of intellectual rigor and curiosity. a look into the mind of a true renaissance man."
"1682",1681,"laskavka","Hezky sepsané zážitky z života jednoho neobyčejného fyzika, které místy pobaví a jinde vedou spíš k hlubším úvahám... Moc hezké. V některým příhodách jsem dokonce i viděla sebe! "
"1683",1682,"Clark S","I have a very close friend, (college buddy), who's a physics professor at a western university. When he was studying for his PhD, I developed an interest in physics. He was reading the serious stuff and I was reading the popular versions for the lay market, (Hawking, Gribbens, Sagan, etc) but also the classics like Einstein, Weinberg,and of course, Richard Feynman.Few people have a sincere passion for their work. Mr. Feynman certainly did. If you have any interest at all, I urge you to seek out the audio version of his Six Easy Pieces lectures. To hear his lectures in his own voice, and his own humor, is inspiring. "
"1688",1687,"Alberto Simal","Seriously enjoyable. At first I was surprised by the short, unconnected anecdotes of what had looked like an autobiographical account, but soon I couldn't get my fill! I admired Mr. Feynman more than before and I am looking forward to reading some other books by him."
"1689",1688,"Colette","What an interesting and thought provoking book by someone who had a truly amazing life. Even as I laughed over some of the crazy anecdotes Feynman tells, I was impressed and inspired by his never-ending intellectual curiosity. After reading Feynman's story, I hope to incorporate more of that into my own life."
"1690",1689,"JHoon","This collection of Richard Feynman's experiences shows how ingenius he was not only in his academic work on physics but also in his daily life. It also shows how sincerely he loved physics, not chasing for his honor or money. I admire his pure love of physics which is based on his curiosity as the subtitle of this book-adventures of a curious character-shows. His anecdotes from his young age explain his life as if comic book describes. When I read this I felt really excited not only because of his amazing academic work but his hilarious moments at his hometown, MIT, Caltech or Cornell. He also remembers his serious moments in his life when he joined in Manhattan project, making Nuclear bomb.Most people usually think physics is boring, tedious and hard but his ingenius explanation of hard concepts in simple language can change the view of most people. This book made me find more books written by him and most of them are really interesting as this book is. I would recommend ""lectures on physics"" , ""Genius"", ""The pleasure of finding things out"". "
"1692",1691,"Darshan Pala","Feynman is the most likable person you might ever meet. A humorous account of one of the greatest men of the twentieth century. A must read if you are a nerd or enjoy a company of a nerd."
"1700",1699,"Mark Sieger","Feynman is one of my heroes. He is responsible for my deep interest in science, and physics in particular. "

"1711",1710,"Marty","Physicist, artist....lockpick???, bongo drum player??? This is a fun book at the life of a true Renaissance man and an important scientist of our time. He's got to be on a very short list for the most interesting person to exist."
"1712",1711,"Arup","A wonderful book. Tells you how to understand things as opposed to memorizing things. Never knew Feynman was such a versatile personality (drummer/painter etc etc to name a few)"
"1714",1713,"Jake McCrary","Very entertaining read. Gives some insight into a man who was quite the curious character. It was a pleasure reading about a guy who clearly enjoyed living and interesting experiences."
"1715",1714,"Petko Bossakov","A wonderful book, with one important note to make: this was actually not designed to be a book. It is a set of anecdotes, selected seemingly at random, taken off tape recordings. There's no chronological order, no embellishment, nothing you'd usually find in a biographical book. Feynman just recounts what he feels is interesting about his life, without going too much into details. Some may not like this style; I do. It feels like chatting with the man himself over a beer, and Feynman is someone I'd be really happy to know personally if I could, with his endlessly curious, nonconformist and a bit stubborn mind of a child that he somehow managed to keep into adulthood."
"1718",1717,"Tschäff","As a Jewish scientist, I am amazed at the parallels with his personality and mine. This guy really revives my desire to expand my understanding of the world in a fun way."
"1722",1721,"Vroomfundel","An amazing insight into one of the greater minds of the last century, and a curious character indeed. I was deeply intrigued by this portrayal of the life and the view point of a fascinating wisecracker scientist (and also a lock-picker, painter, bongo player, pick-up artist and whatnot)"

"1731",1730,"Daniela","One of the most brilliant minds of our time! "
"1732",1731,"Heriberto Cantú","This book made me think about what I am learning when I learn.Am I learning something that I understand?Or am I learning a mechanism that I can use to answer and pass an exam?This opened my eyes completely, and now I always try to understand what I am trying to learn and understand it in a meaningful way, a way that I can explain to myself in examples and in pure form, instead of just learning mechanically what to do like a robot without any knowledge of what I'm doing.This is a MUST. READ. Fun, interesting, and eye-opening."
"1733",1732,"Damian Stewart","Great fun."
"1735",1734,"Kohl Gill","Terrific.At Caltech, especially among physicists in the 1990's, Feynman was spoken about in such awed tones, it was difficult not to resent him, a little bit. That's probably why it's taken me 18 years to finally read this book. What a sensitive ego, huh?That was silly, of course. He was a man—a man obsessed with experimentation and tinkering, in the lab, in social situations, everywhere, but still, a man.I especially appreciated the last part, his Caltech commencement address on the scientific method, and how we fail to use it in life—and, too often, in science, itself. Empiricism is a big part of why I've started my company, and why I remain so passionate about it."
"1739",1738,"Anusha Choory","Absolutely fantastic book!The writing is simple, yet engaging. It's fascinating to know that a Nobel Prize winner could play the bongos, pick locks, experiment with ants, radios, dreams, hallucinations and could even draw. This book has the funniest collection of anecdotes I've ever read and will keep you hooked till the end. Really enjoyed this book, despite my hatred for Physics. "
"1742",1741,"Ken Schroeder","What a character! I love this guy. Some of those stories just make you laugh.Basically, Feynman is just too smart for this world. He doesn't have the time or inclination to learn how to behave, but he is a generally nice and interested guy, the result is he ends of becoming an incredible character and, amongst other things, a master locksmith! What a guy!"
"1743",1742,"Ravi Dawar","Surely one of the funniest books I have ever read. Feynman is an experimenter be it science or life."
"1744",1743,"Srishti","When Hans Bethe calls Richard Feynman ""a magician"" he isn't exaggerating. A brilliant physicist,an outstanding mathematician a remarkable painter, a musician, an astounding personality with experience ranging from astrological theories of Mayans to confronting the queries of the likes of Einstein, from experiments on Biology to testing concepts on psychology, this man of million tongues knew how to take people by awe. A brilliant book giving beautiful insight into the life of this scientist full of wisdom, humor and passion. A must read for book lovers of all taste!"
"1747",1746,"Ingrid Espinosa","Very light (being taped conversations after all), I feel like I've become good friends with Mr Feynman, and I couldn't help chuckling out loud more times than I'd like to admit!Beguiling, entertaining, and inspiriing all at once, this is one book I would recommend to anyone who wants to meet a great, and fun, man. One of a kind! "
"1750",1749,"Sergey Elizarov","Автобиография, от авторай феймановских лекций, он отличный рассказчик, умеющий объяснять просто обо всем, от атомного проекта до квантов. Интересно не только для физиков."
"1752",1751,"Uvun Ramachandran","Honestly, my review of this book is likely to be skewed given that I am a Feynman fanboy. I absolutely loved having some insight into this man's life; I was left wanting more stories..."
"1754",1753,"Aurorae","Recommended for everyone - you don't need to know any physics to enjoy many of his anecdotes. Great read. "
"1755",1754,"Stijn","If you were not a fan of Feynman yet, you'll be afterward. I should not use words like ""delighful"" in reviews, but delightful!"
"1757",1756,"Kismat Pandey","this book changed my life in my aspects."
"1761",1760,"Cate","he's a great, proud character with quirky stories to tell. I like that it's set up as a bunch of short stories so you an read as many or few a you like at a time. Most have a moral, but some are just entertaining. "
"1763",1762,"Elena Kim"," Loved the book!!! It brought me many happy moments. Feynman's love for life at its fullest is contagious. Dying to try some things from the book like discovering how strong sense of smell is. "
"1765",1764,"Chia-Yi","Richard Feynman has a quirky voice, adeptly captured in this book. I hope that someday I'll have a quarter as many good stories as he seems to have. One thing that I truly admire about him is that he is completely open and is always up for a new experience or adventure. My favorite is the one where he wants to volunteer when they tell the student body that a hypnotist will be coming to the university. There are quite a few that are really funny, but this one cracks me up when I imagine it happening.His approach to life is something that I aspire to. Although I'm not very physics-minded, it was cool to read about the work he's done and get a glimpse into how his mind works. He always thought of things in practical terms, and especially when thinking about physics problems he would ask for a real life example to work through in his head. He is one of those people who just needs to know how things work, how they actually work. What about the things he has done for the military? He does talk about his time at Los Alamos, but mostly doesn't go into the details of the physics or the gravity of what the work was. One of the major concepts I like from him is that of cargo cult science and waiting for something to come that will never land. He explains it by going back to when tribes on desolate islands would be visited by cargo planes full of supplies and things they needed. The people would then become taken by the idea that some cargo plane will again come and give them what they need. So they wait around, build landing strips, for a plane that is not coming. "
"1766",1765,"Vijay Menon","Brilliantly written, amazingly hilarious, and something which make you wonder: ""How could one man be all of this?!""."
"1768",1767,"Manoj Chacko","A refreshing book that made me spontaneously burst out laughing many times, this is usually not expected when you are reading the stories of a Nobel price winner and that too of a person considered the worlds greatest theoretical physicist. Its tempting to draw a judgement of his character based on some of the outrageous incidents mentioned but I would think its unfair considering the time and location and perhaps the social acceptance at that time. His curiosity and his amazing ability to think on varied topics left me spell bound. The experiments with dreams and out of body experiences is also intriguing.However the story presentation is for some reason not in chronological order and it confuses you a bit and it takes you back and forth a few times. "

"1775",1774,"Mohammad","The book was awesome and gave me very good insights."
"1782",1781,"HansCronau","An enlightening first hand view into the life and mind of Richard P. Feynman. A curious character indeed, Feynman has the mind of a hacker: a hacker of nature (in physics), but also a hacker of puzzles, locks, women, social situations, and life in general.I loved to read this, and I would advise it to anyone interested in science, looking for a both interesting and entertaining, personal and easy read."
"1784",1783,"Roman","Functions equally well as a collection of funny anecdotes as well as a serious take on what it means to truly like and live science. It's full of advice masquerading as a look 'behind the curtain' into a dedicated, analytic, lighthearted mind."
"1785",1784,"Taistelija","This isn't meant as a proper review, but just a note on the ""prose"" after eyeballing a few of the comments here: this book is a compilation of transcripts. From the preface by Ralph Leighton, ""The stories in this book were collected intermittently and informally during seven years of very enjoyable drumming with Richard Feynman."" These conversations were taped (the audio of the interviews is actually available, per a note in the book for interested readers). So bear that in mind when wondering about the ""questionable prose"" or whether the book was ""ghost-written"". Raw and meandering story-telling, transcribed by Leighton, is what you're getting here. As for Feynman's arrogance -- I more than agree that his almost childish vanity can be grating; particularly when Feynman's (self-confessed) ineptitude for the humanities contributes to his maddening opinion that fields such as English and philosophy are of dubious worth. However, by the time I finished the book, I found I'd forgiven Feynman to the point of wishing he’d been a friend. He is spectacularly genuine -- as unabashedly as he clobbers his audience with his robust ego, he equally honestly remembers his blunders. He even confesses a few Clouseau-like scenarios in which his own ignorance or stupidity inadvertently exposed some previously unrecognized problem, leaving colleagues marveling at his ""insight"". Feynman also doesn't hesitate to explain where a discovery or achievement was primarily the result of a lucky break, unbelievable coincidence, or even pure cheek. And he admits moments where he himself recognized his arrogance -- for instance, he recalls as “stupid and silly” his brief plans to upset Swedish royal protocol to ""show how ridiculous their custom was"".Feynman was a genius and he knew it, but his arrogance and self-confidence never gave way to pomposity -- how many other Nobel laureates would relate their misadventures in trying to get laid?Finally, I strongly disagree that Feynman was “showing off” by tallying his accomplishments in music and painting. Not only does he remind, frequently, that his achievements were still largely amateur, he conveys an enviably childlike happiness in his varied lives outside physics. Feynman was a resilient and joyful person who never forgot how to play -- I find his attitude toward life infectious. On that score, his energetic, irreverent life is inspirational even to clods like myself who could never hope to understand theoretical physics."

"1791",1790,"Seetharaman T","Upon reading this book, I really felt that I had missed a lot in life by not studying in one of the universities in US. I like my country and my culture, but I have to accept that US is far superior in education and technology. We study lot of things and memorise only to get marks. We hardly apply the knowledge and we are not taught to do so. Richard Feynman is a genius and makes science funny and simple in his essays. A crime thriller would not have been more interesting than this book."
"1794",1793,"David Rutland","very fun and funny. great insight into a brilliant man who was a real mensch."
"1796",1795,"GŸy","I've picked this book up (and it's twin, 'What Do You Care What Other People Think?') and read from them every few months for the past 20 years.They never fail to delight and amuse - completely.Regardless of your education, experiences, interests or background, I recommend these books to everyone and anyone.I'm an unapologetic fanboy of the highest order when it comes to my favorite theoretical physicist from Far Rockaway.Pick them both up as soon as possible..."
"1798",1797,"Aravind Deivendran","brilliant book explaining the life of a true rebel in academic world. I always thought academics are introverts and eccentrics, here I met a very social physicist."
"1801",1800,"Ashkan Entezari","A brilliant book that introduce us to the world of a Nobel prize winner. We look at different sides of his adventurous life and get to know many surprising stories about him. Also I should add here that I really liked the last chapter of this book (Cargo Cult Science) which he talked about scientific integrity, it was very touching and he points out a few important things for those who want to do a scientific work."
"1804",1803,"Gajanan Lonkar","a perfect example of how you can be cool while being nerdy and sucecssful. Not to mention njoi the life. Mr Fenyman.. you are an inspiration. "

"1812",1811,"Yinan Wl","My favourite person ever possibly"
"1816",1815,"Rosann","I found this book by accident when I was browsing the always available bookshelf on my libraries digital service and I loved it. It was fascinating to see how his mind worked. I especially enjoyed the part about his hobby of safe-cracking."
"1817",1816,"Brooke"," I can't tell you how much I loved this book - every couple pages I'd either be laughing out loud or telling my husband how much he would love it/needed to read it. Feynman's perspective is absolutely endearing. I'm incredibly grateful my friend Amy recommended this to me."
"1818",1817,"Luis","This book is great. It puts us on the head of the great physicist, Mr. Feynman. He tells us how he picked up girls in Las Vegas, how he started drawing and selling paints, how he lock picked, played drums, and most of all, the reasons of his hating for the educational system, teaching, and supposedly intelligent mans. His life was so complete and fascinating... He's unique.I came to the occlusion that he's a humble man and an example to follow. Reading this motivates me to stay true to myself, do what I want and enjoy, be free and don't give a f about the others"
"1819",1818,"Winston O'Toole","When I grow up, I am going to be Richard Feynman."
"1825",1824,"Christopher Struck","A must read!"
"1826",1825,"Pasquale","Un genio che si autoracconta con qualche tocco di egocentrismo ed esagerazione. Divertente, affascinante, motivante. Lo consiglierei ad adolescenti."
"1827",1826,"Jayson Hoogeveen","Great book of anecdotes from a curious scientist."
"1829",1828,"Scurra","I sometimes wonder if Richard Feynman was some sort of collaborative fantasy created by a bunch of Harvard students pulling random words out of a hat to see how absurd things could get before people stopped believing that one person could have done all of that and won a Nobel Prize as well.Not only is this a glorious collection of incredible anecdotes from a life that had more packed into it than any ten normal people, but he even manages to teach you a little bit of quantum theory along the way without you noticing.There's a laugh on virtually every page, along with primers on safe cracking and bongo playing. A model of how to do it - always assuming that your life is as crazy as his, which seems a remote likelihood."
"1837",1836,"Snootwaller","An amazing biography of one of the greatest minds of the 20th century."
"1838",1837,"Riccardo","Fonte di inspirazione. La vita di Feynman è raccontata con divertenti aneddoti che fanno emergere l'indole dello scrittore fornendo buoni spunti di riflessione."
"1841",1840,"Marios","""There was no importance from what I was doing but ultimately there was."" With this phrase Feynman described how a spinning plate sparked his curiosity and how by deciding to work out some of its properties -just for the fun of it- he was led to insights which ultimately resulted in the Nobel Prize in psysics. It reminded me of childhood, how intriguing seemed the simplest of things, how many hours could be spent playing or curiously doing things without any practical outcome, just for the sake of joy and pleasure.But most importantly it manifested how many hours can still be found for hobbies or for the pursuit of silly but fun ideas, all while one works, learns, teaches, socializes, womanizes, marries a couple of times, raises kids and altogether succeeds in combining an exciting personal life with a remarkable career. That was Richard Feynman, and whenever I feel I'm getting ""too busy"" I will think again. Eventually, seeing how Feynman's adventures and life worked out suggests that good things can come if one follows such an approach. You will most likely not get a Nobel prize, your life story may not be be as interesting or worth mentioning and even if it all doesn't quite work out as well in the end, at least you will have had a nice time in the meantime. Rediscover and cultivate your curiosity about all things, don't fear the awkward or the time-wasting, throw yourself in difficult situations and push through with childlike enthusiasm. Be sceptic but eager to meet all sorts of people. That was for me the essence of those stories. What an inspiring book and what a refreshing way of looking at life this new year. "
"1843",1842,"Bryan J Harris","Wildly entertaining collection of short witty stories "
"1845",1844,"Murdho Savila","Mr. Feynman was a brilliant man!"
"1846",1845,"St. Wait","This is a great read about a physicist's adventures, while trying to make sense of the world around him. Each time I read this it reminds me how concerned I get with dumb stuff. Feynman didn't physically sit down and write this book. Rather the content comes from interviews between him and a fellow musician. Also, very entertaining if you get the audiobook for long trips!"
"1847",1846,"Guimi","This book is unique. It's hilarious, it's amazing, it's thrilling, it's curious...Wellcome to the life of one of the most wonderfull minds and most excentric man!Richard Feynman is mainly known as a Noble-prize winner and a central piece at Manhattan Project (the one that lead to the first atom bomb). He's also known as a science divulger. But he was also a drummer at a carnival band on Rio de Janeiro, an artist, a philosopher, a safe-box opener...The title is what you repeatedly will think while reading the book: That can't be real, surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman!"

"1856",1855,"247innovation","My all time favorite book..."
"1857",1856,"matt","One of the best books I've ever read. Feynman lived an extraordinary life and had an extraordinary mind, but his simple, matter-of-fact and hilarious recitation in this quasi-autobiography makes one feel like anything he did, the reader can do if they just think about it enough. It's a very inspiring set of anecdotes. "

"1863",1862,"Ioana Johansson","Absolutely brilliant man and funny account of his life. Worth reading. "
"1865",1864,"Dianne","Excellent book about an astonishing mind and eccentric character and his work."
"1866",1865,"Miguel Ángel Vilela","It was amazing because he was. Richard P. Feynman was an extraordinary man. Even though it's him who tells how he lived, I couldn't help wish I'd met him. This book also taught me a few valuable things about live and people, apart from being good fun to read :)----Este libro es magnífico porque Richard P. Feynman fue un hombre extraordinario. Aunque sea el mismo quien relata cómo vivió, no pude evitar desear haberle conocido. Este libro también me enseño unas cuantas lecciones valiosas sobre la vida y la gente, además de ser muy entretenido y hacerme reir :)"
"1867",1866,"Shaunt","Not only is Feynman a genius, he's also quite a character. He's well-aware of his intelligence and doesn't shy away from telling the reader all about it. This book is a semi-biographical collection of experiences and energetic short stories. The reader is given the opportunity to empathize with the ecstasy Feynman feels from fueling his own curious drive."
"1869",1868,"Ghalia","science"
"1871",1870,"Steve Puma","I just read a few chapters of this marvelous book, and it reminded me just how fun a book it is. It amazes me not only how brilliant Mr. Feynman was, but also how childlike and mischievous he was. He simply loved life and loved physics. My favorite chapter is the one where the wife of a traveling entertainer teaches him how to pick up girls, at a hostess bar, and he is shocked when it actually works!"
"1873",1872,"Mircea Lungu","we all have the funny stories of our lives, that we tell at parties and dinners, but we don't necessarily think about publishing them; feynman did and it came out awesome :) the main message that seems to bind everything together is that you approach things methodically you can master anything. and feynman illustrates his point with stories from various aspects of his life: conquering ladies, playing the drums, drawing and painting, speaking fake japanese, and making music. "
"1877",1876,"Wuenschel","Mr. Feinman (a Nobel-prize winning physicist) is an incredible intellectual, a true adventurer, and quite frank and humble. All characteristics make for a wonderful auto-biography. Interspersed with tales of his escapades in science, as a philanderer, and awkward forays in to culture, are these incredible gems of wisdom. He expounds on true science, education, and intelligence. From a historical standpoint, the book is also interesting. Mr. Feinman worked on the atom bomb at Los Alamos during WWII. "
"1879",1878,"Fredrik","Lydbok. Utrolig bra. Oppleseren (hva kalles folk som leser lydbøker) var utrolig flink - innlevelse, og hver gang det var snakk om utlendinger og fremmedspråk hadde han alltid aksenten rett (ihvertfall skal jeg tro det).Feynman har levd et utrolig morsomt liv, og hadde masse artige og interessante påfunn. Hobby å dirke opp safer på Los Alamos mens han jobbet på atombomben, for eksempel."

Myslel jsem si, že pracujeme den za dnem, cvičíme a pochodujeme kvůli karnevalu – ale když tu karneval byl, velká část kapely se neobjevila a nesoutěžili jsme moc dobře. Dokonce, když už jsme pochodovali po ulici, někteří lidé z kapely zbíhali. Byl to podivný výsledek! Vlastně jsem to pořádně nikdy nepochopil, ale možná že hlavní zábava a vzrušení spočívalo v pokusu zvítězit v soutěži pláží, která – jak většina lidí cítila – odpovídala jejich úrovni. A mimochodem, taky že jsme tuhle soutěž vyhráli.Během toho desítiměsíčního pobytu v Brazílii jsem se začal zajímat o hladiny energií v lehkých jádrech. Celou teorii jsem vypracoval ve svém hotelovém pokoji, ale chtěl jsem si ověřit, jak vypadají experimentální údaje. Byly to nové věci, kterými se zabývali experti z Caltechu v Kellogg Laboratory.
Takových pěkných přechodů je kniha plná. Pouze 1 volný řádek dělí od přeskočení myšlenky, od holek k elektronům, od bubnů k elektronovým hladinám, od samby k malování, k výuce, zpět k holkám... :-)Na Feynmanovi se mi moc líbí, že když si něco umanul, tak se do toho zakousl a trénoval a dokázal to posunout na úroveň, kdy si toho někdo jiný všiml. Ať už to byl cizí jazyk, hra na nástroje, kreslení. Kniha je vtipná, optimistická. Opravdu jsem se velice bavil. Moc hezké čtení."
"1884",1883,"Adam Williams","This book is the most inspiring autobiographical book I've ever read! It inspires new ways of thinking about the world, and it's an amazing portrait of a man who did a lot of interesting things which were in no way limited to science.Everyone should read this immediately."
"1889",1888,"Ievgeniia Tkhoo","it's really interesting about math, physics and Feynman's story life"
"1890",1889,"Shane","I can only hope I lived as Feynman in my previous life."
"1893",1892,"Lukasz gadowski","Inspiring, Feynman is a truly cool person and a multitalent."
"1895",1894,"Talal Chaudhry","A fantastic read. An insight into the mind of an amazing scientist. His thinking, and thought process plus vivid imagination of how to look at problems is a sight to behold. The man lived an extraordinary amazing and enlightening life!"
"1897",1896,"Sahil Hossain","An amusing read: written as an assortment of anecdotes, the book, though not a proper biography in its traditional form, depicts the wit and the humorous side of one of the best scientific minds of twentieth century. Not laden with mathematical equations and physical abstraction, the book is a must-read for the scientific-minded faction of the general population."
"1898",1897,"Pratik Shinde","Awesome experience. How can a man touch so many things in his lifetime? is the question left behind. "
"1899",1898,"A.E. Croft","Brilliantly written and hilarious! I will definitely reread again and again. "
"1901",1900,"Kt","This book was so good. It has some silly stories, fascinating historical perspectives, and some serious science talk, but my favorite parts were when he talks about realizations he came to at particular points throughout his life. It was all just so inspiring.Maybe I am liking how relatable it was too. I'm not completely sure, but just writing this review makes me want to read it again (for a third time)."
"1903",1902,"Sassan","The late and great Richard Feynman meticulously and beautifully takes us on a journey of his wild, adventurous and intellectually gifted life in this collection of his adventures. This genius and Nobel Laureate was one of the great minds of the 20th century and demonstrates in this collection of his personal experiences why it is not necessarily WHAT you think but HOW you think that makes a great mind. If there is any reading that I would highly recommend to others, it would be this funny witted collection for precisely the aforementioned reason. A wonderful read and HIGHLY recommended! "
"1905",1904,"Katerina","Удивительный, потрясающий, невероятный человек! Ричард Фейнман собрал все качества, которые мне нравятся в людях. Его любовь к жизни, увлеченность, умение достигать совершенства в заинтересовавшем его деле восхищают. А чувство юмора! Чего только стоят одни эксперименты над цензорами в Лос-Аламосе. Как один человек может быть настолько разносторонним? Физика, биология, открытия в науке, премии, преподавание, рисование, музыка, взлом сейфов... Не забываем, что он еще успевал развлекаться (например, искать приключения в Лас-Вегасе). Эту книгу надо читать обязательно и менять свой взгляд на жизнь. It was very, very interesting! It was extremely interesting. (c)"
"1906",1905,"Rohan","Sometime back when I read my first Feynman book ""What Do You Care What Other People Think?"", I was thinking if some of his other works would be as interesting as that book. Clearly, I was wrong because ""Surely You're Joking Mr.Feynman"" is an even more amazing read. Feynman talks about his life, his thought process and his mischievous nature during most of his life. Although you need to understand there is not much Physics talk in this book but the book does talk a whole lot about his sexist nature, his childhood, experiences and the challenges he faced entering the world of famous physicists. While reading the book, it is easy for us to see Feynman as a Egoistic person but combining it with the other book, I do believe that he was a Genius in every sense of the word. A must read. "
"1907",1906,"Stephen Sakuma","A really inspiring book. A little slow and random at times but it shows you what interesting things you can do with your life. Feynman is a strong advocate of science and reason and calls bullshit on the crap that the world is full of. He was a smart man who attained much success and through this book we see that he did it with much fun in between."
"1909",1908,"Melek","Richard Feynman is a brilliany physicist but also a great writer. This autobiographical book about his memories made me giggle more than once. He is one of the not-so-many ""unexpectedly fun"" scientists. "
"1916",1915,"Nikhil Reddy","Amazing book. No words to describe Feynman's attitude and i liked the way it was narrated to a person and then penned down."
"1921",1920,"Ryanjustus","Hilarious book about one of the most intelligent people of the 20th century."
"1922",1921,"Sundry","The beginning of my crush on the gregarious physicist."
"1924",1923,"Elizabeth","Cheered me up considerably. Mr. Feynman seems like a very sensible man. "

"1930",1929,"Heidy","Surprisingly hilarious read. Who knew a physicist could be so funny?"
"1932",1931,"Jose Carlos","Un libro interesante por conocer cómo pensaba uno de lo grandes físicos del siglo XX. La curiosidad era su mayor pasión y a lo largo del libro nos lo muestra con cada una de sus ""aventuras""."
"1935",1934,"Alex Harris","Seriously fun, it made me wish even more that I'd been taught physics by Richard Feynman. He is a genius explainer, a brilliant bongo player, and the most inquisitive person I've ever read about. Reading this will make you want to figure out why everything in your house works."
"1936",1935,"Vuka :3","I always liked Feynman, which is understandable, nobody can deny that he was a really interesting fellow. But this book is just too much... oh boy, how I underestimated this guy! I can't even begin to describe how much I enjoyed it and although I'm obviously biased, I highly and sincerely recommend it to everyone, at least for the laughs you'll get from his stories!"
"1937",1936,"Stan Underhill","Awesome. Just a crazy interesting guy!"
"1938",1937,"Ino Murko","No words can describe how excellent this book is."
"1939",1938,"Jim O'shaughnessy","Brilliant book about a brilliant man. "
"1942",1941,"Ilya Lakhman","Simply brilliant!"
"1946",1945,"Joyce","Turns out there is a difference between a great scientist who writes well and a great writer who knows science well. This book made me proud to be a scientist (even if I'm not a physicist). "
"1948",1947,"Khang Diep","I really admire Richard Feynman's integrity, sense of humour, knowledge, and talent. This book is absolutely inspiring and amusing to read."
"1953",1952,"Pranav Negandhi","This is a great travel book. Some people might be put off by the author and think it's another drab science book or some other dense research that professors and Nobel laureates would love to push out. But this is nothing like that.It's a very casual, fun and gripping collection of adventures of a very distinguished scientist of our modern times. And far from being a technical book that few might grasp (I'm looking at you, A Brief History of Time), most people with a high-school education will not only understand, but even come to love the tales that Feynman describes. From growing up, to attending university, to being a professor and a scientist on the atomic bomb project, to being a traveller and an all-round fun character - Feynman puts a lot of exciting and enlightening incidents in this little book.If there's one thing that I take from this book, it's the author's constant desire to learn and try new experiences. Far be it from him to refuse an opportunity to do something new. And he was genuinely excited about it too.Highly recommended, especially as a growing-years book for young adults, although ageing cynics too can find tons of learning and new direction from this little publication."
"1954",1953,"Benjamin Plaggenborg","These are the autobiographical essays of the coolest nerd of all time. I don't know many science geeks who haven't heard of Feynman, and of those, all admire him. Well, apart from Murray Gell-Mann, who claimed the stories were to some extent fantastical, but they're still a source of tremendous inspiration, enjoyment and laughter. At least to me. The storytelling is in Feynman's typical layman fashion, and I find I can read it in almost any state, at almost any opportunity. Every time I read one of those stories, rather, as soon as I start reading them, I'm transported into a world where physics is hard, but a passion, Nature is devoid of miracles, yet intensely fascinating, and life is filled with cockiness and one-upmanship. However fabricated these stories are, they relentlessly and unfailingly (re)open my eyes to the joy of science."
"1955",1954,"Steven Ackerley","Excellent. Worth it for the 'Ant ferrying' chapter alone."
"1956",1955,"Melinda","I recently read this book aloud on two car trips with Andrew up north. We laughed a lot, and did not fall asleep while driving."
"1957",1956,"Tara","Feynman is just so damn smart and funny that it's impossible not to love him, and this book is impossible to put down. It was after reading this that I decided I wanted to major in physics when I started my first year in college. He really proves that one can live life doing everything and anything they want to do. "
"1961",1960,"Tomader Almahdi","Finishing this book was like saying goodbye to an old friend. Richard Feynman was intelligent, passionate and quite an inspiration. The way he explained science in the most simple and beautiful form. and I quote him: ""I was an ordinary person who studied hard.""❤️"
"1962",1961,"Andrew Escobedo","Richard Feynman is the most interesting person that you'll never meet, but at least you'll get to read his experiences and adventures. The book is written by the man himself, Richard Feynman, the man who worked in the notorious Manhattan project, the man who won the Nobel Prize, the guy who constructed the theory, ""Sum over histories."" This man is an absolute genius at what he does, but what really grabs you is his goofy and delightful persona. His stories are out right shocking at times, and I found myself laughing at loud several times throughout the book. I also found his thinking, although purely anecdotal, extremely enlightening without going too overboard on the philosophy. He really humanizes science in a way that everyone can really appreciate and get excited for, and also shows just how far curiosity can really take someone. "
"1963",1962,"Brian R. Mcdonald","There are three books which I have for at least 20 years constantly pushed on all my friends who read, almost without regard to their own tastes. The autobiography is one of them not because of any theme or message [although to the extent that it has some I heartily agree:] but solely because it is such rollicking good fun. Feynman is by far the most fascinating person whom I have ever regretted not meeting, and every book I've seen about him is a great read. However, his voice and that of his ghostwriter, Ralph Leighton, make the already great anecdotes all the more fun. For most of us, there can be no higher aspiration than to have lived his life for just one day, and to write about it with such incredible elan."
"1966",1965,"Kingley","Richard Phillips Feynman was an American theoretical physicist. He is ranked as one of the greatest physicists who ever lived. A brilliant character, a mathematical genius and a delight of a person. Feynman will lure you in with charm and charisma and will wow you with his unorthodox approach to life and problem solving. He is a child at heart who loves discovery and playing with problems brought to him by nature. I love this book but I prefer his audio interview called Los Alamos From Below. If you've never heard of it, please do yourself a favor and listen to it. You can thank me later.This autobiography paints a broad stroke on the life of Feynman. He talks about his time at Los Alamos with the atomic bomb project during WW2. He talks about his tenure as professor of physics at MIT, Caltech and Cornell. He also mentions his adventures all over the world from Brazil to Tokyo and all the people he meets along the way, from bars, clubs in vegas, parades in the streets and science conventions with the greatest minds of the 20th century. This is the adventure of a curious character indeed. I don't usually read biographies but I made an exception for Richard Feynman because I know he is a unique individual. Glad I gave it a shot, it did not disappoint. Fun, witty and always brilliant."
"1968",1967,"Vlad","Funny and inspiring.I listened to the audio version."
"1969",1968,"Dilip Kushwaha","Book covers various phases of Mr. Feynman's multidimensional personality.Really enjoyed the book. It covers details from his childhood, when he was professor, while working with the team to invent atom bomb, noble prize, his second marriage, learning fine arts, playing bongo and many more interesting incidents."
"1970",1969,"Josh Dalzell","This is a great book about the antics of an unbelievably smart man and his observations of how life works while developing nuclear weapons and manipulating humans."
"1972",1971,"Holly Blackstone","I love physics and nuclear technology, and first read this book years ago; I was interested in finding out more about one of the brilliant American minds in physics and someone who worked on the Manhattan Project.The book is written in a casual, offhand style, almost so much that you think, 'THIS is Richard Feynman?', but the relaxed narrative method works and makes it almost seem more like stream of consciousness, as if you're getting a deep glimpse into the amazing man. He lived quite a varied and interesting life, and you see his human side, (the death of first wife Arline), to how varied his interests are; he threw himself into life and as a result had some amazing experiences. There is some tech thrown in, but not so much and to a degree that a casual reader couldn't get along fine without knowing it. Feynman seems very human - talking about inadequacies he felt he had, and relating mischief he caused - that the book makes you feel oddly comforted and okay being the unique person you are. Dick Feynman, great mind in physics, learned how to crack safes and wasted lots of time in Vegas! A great, fun book. "
"1973",1972,"Marko Bošković","It is an autobiography, sort of, one that does not focus on deeds and achievements as much as it focuses on interests, ""obsessions"" and impressions, so after reading it, instead of feeling that I know about the man I have a feeling that I have known the man himself, that I can picture him in various situations and guess how he would have acted and reacted.This is the man that I got to know: A strange man, indeed. At first I ""judged"" him a bit arrogant, always thinking how he's better and smarter then everyone else, those silly philosophers, biologists, mathematicians... but soon I changed my mind as I kept on reading. He does not care about being judged, and so he puts no effort at praises to himself or false modesties. He is either so sure of his place and reputation, or he does not care about them at all, that he would tell any story, however unexpected or controversial.And he loves telling stories, and at moments you do wonder if he is joking, or making them up. I mean, can it really be a single man to take (a small) part on the development of radar, to take (a greater) part on development of atom bomb, to know and interact with some of the most famous scientist of his day, to be himself very successful scientist at several fields of physics and acknowledged by piers as such, at the same time to live the life to the full, to play in a Samba school (band) during the Rio carnival, to play bongo and other percussions and also to collaborate on writing and playing music for a ballet piece, to be an amateur painter, a one that sells, gets commissions and manages to put up a successful solo exhibition, to report that he managed to control his own dreams and managed to induce hallucinations and out of body experiences. There are probably some aspects to Richard Feynman that I missed to mention, but even with these, he lived lives of at least ten different men all condensed into one!""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman"" is very interesting and easy to read. It's a pity that a story on his plans to visit Tuva was not included..."
"1976",1975,"Jacob","This book ""was terrific""."
"1977",1976,"Tom Brown","Feynman is the most interesting nerd in the world. Read this book and bask in his awesomeness."
"1979",1978,"Piyali Chatterjee","witty, funny, honest :) inspired me to experiment :)"
"1984",1983,"Stella","What was wonderful for me about this book (something that I believe few others could claim) is that when I started reading it, I had almost no idea who Richard Feynman was or how big a hot-shot he was or anything. I didn't even know he'd won the Nobel Prize! So I had the great pleasure of learning about his life as it went along. When I was impressed by something he did, I was impressed because of what he did and not because of who he was. So when he's talking about picking locks, I'm thinking ""that's way cool!"" but it's not cool because he's The Feynman...I'd have been just as impressed if a friend of mine had done it. And I'm sure that is how he'd have wanted it. So I had a wonderful time reading about the adventures of, to me, a wonderful man, who was very intelligent, very curious and not afraid of being who he was, but he's also a man with insecurities and prejudices and everything else that human beings have. I wasn't even impressed by the science...mostly because I know nothing about it and I skipped right through it. I was happy there wasn't much of it because I'd have missed out on reading a great book about a great person. I felt like I could be very objective about his life and his book because I had no notions about anything, and I liked him entirelyfor the person he seems to be and I like the honesty with which it's written. I felt I had to add this last bit because of some of the other reviews I read. Did I think Feynman was annoying, arrogant, full-of-himself? Sure I did! Very much so. But just because someone is arrogant and annoying doesn't mean that they aren't great people and don't have great stories to tell. He is and he does. "
"1987",1986,"Konstantin Okonechnikov","Amazing book, lifestyle guide for every scientist :)"
"1988",1987,"Gary Scothern","the anecdotes of my absolutle idle well worth a read."
"1989",1988,"Nadin Boegelsack","I'm not a fan of biographies usually, but this one I thoroughly enjoyed. It reads more like a collection of short stories. He is quite a character and yes, it can seem a little annoying at times, but I liked that he didn't shy away from showing his flaws either - he is telling his story afterall. I got this book from a friend I met on a roadtrip through the USA and it couldn't have been a more perfect ending to an incredible adventure. Just the kind Dick Feynman was a fan of himself apparently!"
"1992",1991,"Penny","Actually I originally read this book when I worked at Scribners in 1989, but remembered how great it is and reread it a few months ago.Feynman is a physicist who taught at Cornell and Princeton, worked on the Manhattan Project and won the Nobel Prize. He's also a complete hoot. The book is a series of autobiographical stories -- pranks pulled as a student at MIT and at Los Alamos, teaching himself to paint, scientific discoveries he made, his three marriages, how he was rejected by the draft board for being mentally suspect (they asked him if he ever heard voices and he said yes he did and then went on to describe what he found interesting about that. He said that sometimes when falling in and out of sleep he'd imagine conversations with his foreign-born colleagues and the voices in his head spoke accurately with their accents -- but that if he tried to imitate such accents he could not do so at all. So how was it that one part of his brain had captured accents correctly but another hadn't? This was entirely typical of Feynman's wide ranging curiosity and intelligence, but the end result in this case was that the psychologists decided he was nuts. His colleagues at Cornell were vastly amused by this.)What I love about Feynman -- first of all, his great interest in everything and his willingness to experiment. The great joy he found in working things through (he said that the reason he'd never tried drugs, though he was tempted, was that he enjoyed thinking too much and didn't want to risk that.) Also, he's clearly so very intelligent and reading his book, his thoughts seem so easy to follow -- it makes the world of science seem accessible."
"1994",1993,"Charlotte Dungan","I've loved this book. It is hilarious. I've started reading parts of it to the kids and they think it's so great that they keep begging for more. My only criticism is that Feynman is a womanizer, but it is pretty easy to skip the chapters where he's in a bar and just enjoy the rest. "
"1995",1994,"Mary Beth Laychak","One of my favorite books of all time. Richard Feynman shows that people who go into science are not boring, humorless people. "

Of a physicist called Richard Feynman. It gets to all sorts of things, especially insane things, that Feynman did in his life at the university and elsewhere. The narrator is Feynman's drummer friend, who recorded their conversations and the amusing stories of Feynman while they were drumming together.He tells us, in a very entertaining way, about his experiences of cracking safes, painting a naked woman, go out looking for adventure at clubs in Vegas and all kinds of hilarious and fun things, until you start to think physics is not as boring as it seems.Feynman's life are full of intelligence, courage, prowess, because of his boundless curiosity. This man gets to see the world and meet all its glory and beauty in exceptional occasions.This book stayed with me and will remain with me all the time. It's the kind of book that follow you well into the future.I definitely planning on reread it, someday."

"2034",2033,"Asails F","I found myself unable to make fair judgement about: Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! Adventures of a Curious Character. One day I gave it three stars and another five. I should think that it certainly deserves five stars in that it is one of the few books that delve into the mind of a genius and gives some idea to their thought process's. My desire to write a review of this book are threefold:I was stationed in Orlando Florida and it was mandatory that we watch the liftoff's.After the Challenger shuttle disaster I worked for a woman who did quality assurance for repairs on US Polaris ballistic missile systems who worked with the same seals that failed on the shuttle disaster. Long before the results were published by the investigation team she met Mr. Feynman on a flight to duty stations. In their exchange he asked her what she thought was the problem and told him without a doubt it was the seals. Reagan the president at the time this disaster had exerted pressure to launch the Challenger in the overly cold weather. I also watched the media's involvement and unneeded sensationalism about the delays that undoubtedly provoked a too hasty decision to launch. I have read many management studies attributing this debacle as a legacy of the decision making process called Groupthink. As this can only be so and knowledge of the affects of cold on the seals was widely know in professional circles and also at NASA it must be surmised that we have a warped decision making system in place in our government.The lightness that Feynman's stories give to the seriousness of his academic career must only be surmised as a way of dealing with his knowledge of how many problems the Earth is facing in part due to our faulty decision making. It was driven home after watching a video about his life where I was almost brought to tears... The must see video is The Quest For Tannu Tuva[1988] which seemed to be more widely shown in the UK than in the US.Let's learn from Feynman."
"2035",2034,"Don Weidinger","The humility to listen and learn, life experiences, with radio, ants, smelling, the value of all knowing what is going-on vs keeping in the dark, Fermi, Oppenheimer, the value of challenging dialogue vs yes men, picking locks, the bomb, 4f, drawing nudes, pompous fools, averaging of book scores, coco cabanna music, text book reviews and lots more. What is learning, science based on theories that dont work and science that is not science."

"2043",2042,"Varinia","The ultimate read for a nerd who wants to be entertained. Feynman was amazing!"
"2046",2045,"Lily","Oh Mr. Feynman, he was truly amazing and very interesting to read about. He loved to learn but most of all enjoyed everything he was learning. He quickly became a master safecracker, a Zamba dancer, a musician on bongo drums, and an amateur artist from simple curious interests that he followed through. And these interests where definitely out of his comfort zone! In his eyes (and sometimes others), he was the BEST in that expertise. All because he enjoyed everything and didn’t give up until mastering each technique/skill, each paint stroke, or dance twirl. Besides his quirkiness, Feynman's personality screamed louder than anyone in any room. His bluntness is something that became a theme to me in this book. From accepting his Nobel Prize, reviewing chemistry books, and stating the freedom to your scientific integrity when experimenting, Feynman always let others know where he stood. It's what made him very respected. Feynman truly inspired me to follow through some of my curiosities and experience NOW, especially out of my comfort bubble that I live in. After reading this book, I picked up a new language (and I have to say I'm getting better every day), joined a non-profit organization to tutor children in science, and scheduled a trip out to another country for adventure/education experiences."
"2047",2046,"Bethany Moore","This is the notorious autobiography of Richard Feynman, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics for developing the Quantum Physics Theory (with a bunch of other people of course). This guy is even funnier than Kary Mullis, and extremely practical. He also worked on the Manhattan Project (and broke into top-secret files by picking locks for kicks) and gives a lot of information on that. Fabulous, energetic read!"

I was still living at home and I remember laughing my fool head off and my mom asking me what I was reading. When I told her it was an autobiography by a physicist, she could not understand why it was so funny, but Feynman was funny. And a great teacher. Most of my joy in the book was because it was the first time I'd read about all the wonderings and daydreams and funny stuff everyone has in their heads from someone with a genus-level intelligence and no filter. Still a great, fun read :-)"
"2051",2050,"KennyO","This is the book for people who love the idea of Richard Feynman but who hold no hope of understanding why he is an important scientist and human being. A brief, feel good read. "
"2052",2051,"Melba","(I'll return to give a better review later.) Dr. Feynman tells some of the funniest anecdotes I've ever read. He's an incredible mix of raw intelligence, simple pragmatism, and insatiable curiosity; he's an accomplished physicist, but also someone with an appreciation for a diverse array of subjects, and the people who spend their lives studying them. His insights (into education, governance, scientific discovery, politics, art, relationships... even biology!) are just unparalleled. I will be re-reading this many times, I'm sure. "
"2055",2054,"Aram Sohigian","Such a great sense of humor and such humility. It would have been a joy to meet Dr. Feynman and worked with him."
"2060",2059,"Matthew Shoe","Entertaining stories told by an amazing character. Feynman is the clever and amazing genius most people wish they could be. Anyone who admires the power of curiosity and the places where it can lead should read this book.And I would say to some of the more negative reviewers: if Feynman seems a little self-centered or egotistical; it's only because this is an autobiography and he is one of the 20th century's greatest scientists. So he has a reason for seeming smug."
"2061",2060,"Kunal Sen","The Most Fascinating ManI just met the most fascinating man in my life – just finished reading “Surely You Must be Joking Mr. Feynman”. Here is a man who is probably one of the brightest that ever walked on this planet. A person who was relentlessly curious, and not just about his own craft, but about almost everything he encountered. An incredibly mischievous person who took nothing very seriously, but at the same time took everything seriously enough to explore passionately. Feynman was obsessed with solving problems, and not just in Physics but anything that he took interest in, and that’s a very large universe from machines to drumming, from school education to picking up women in a bar, from art to Mayan hieroglyphics. Above all, he was a man who was irreverent towards all ideas until it made complete sense to him.What bothered Feynman the most was people’s lack of deep understanding of what they believe they understand. Most of us believe we understand a few things, especially things that relate to our professions, but do we really? Most of us have a very superficial sense of things that we know, which may be adequate to waddle through our jobs and our life, but the kind of deep understanding that Feynman is referring to, where everything fits together and makes perfect sense, where one is capable of explaining to another individual with perfect clarity, is mostly missing. Even more dangerous is that fact that most of us are not even aware how muddled our understandings are. Most of us, as individuals, and sometimes entire professions, suffer from this grand illusion without ever being challenged.I wish I read this book many decades earlier, because there was a possibility that it could have changed my life. I believe it should be a must-read for all young people, especially those that plan to take up a scientific, or for that matter, any intellectual profession. Looking back at my childhood, I had very similar curiosities as Feynman, and like him I spent most of my time tinkering with things and exploring everything from fire to ants and from machines to questions like why we find something musical. However, I was not even nearly as smart, but more importantly, I did not have his perseverance. Many of us are curious when we are young, but intellectual laziness prevents us from exploring them adequately. Most of us also lack the spirit to challenge all ideas that came from authority sources. To Feynman, every idea had to make perfect sense to him, and until then he simply would not accept them. I, on the other hand, grew up with values that tried to convince me that having some “beliefs” is a virtue. These beliefs did not come as religious or social dictates but more as moral and political wisdom, and I convinced my young mind that I am making perfectly rational choices. The funny thing is, if you asked me when I was in my teens or twenties. I would have proclaimed the same mindset that Feynman had, except I really did not practice it. What a remarkable human being – almost unbelievable! I have never met or seen Feynman. Once I stood just outside his office door in CalTech. I have been extremely lucky to have met and spent time with his close friend and colleague Murray Gell-Mann, who is often mentioned in this book. Another astounding mind…"

"2068",2067,"Ben Haley","Nerd, Prankster, Genius, and Ladies Man Richard Feynman leads a dream life for a scientist. His high paced prose consists of story after story ranging from his safe cracking at Los Alamos to his nude paintings at cal tech. We hear about the time Feynman left a quarter tip in an upside down glass for his waitress, how the motion of a wobbling plate led him to a Nobel prize, and how he became a world famous ballet drummer. Feynman tells his stories quickly without pause for reflection but along they way we are inspired by a few important lessons of his life.1. Teach to avoid complacency2. Be sure you are motivated to work by the fun of it, not the importance of the problem.3. Science requires the integrity to report bad results.In all its a great book, one you must read to enjoy the enthusiasm of.	"
"2069",2068,"Tiaan van der Merwe","What can I say about one of the greatest individuals in the history of science. Probably that he was a scoundrel, a smart-ass and a trickster. Feynman presents his life as a series of riddles and puzzles to be solved only to uncover more puzzles and riddles. The trick in this regard, is to always maintain your curiosity. He takes curiosity to a whole new level as well as taking it sideways into the realms of ""my, what a curious thing to do."" This (probably the best autobiography ever written) looks into the life of the drumming, underground-samba-musician, artist, safe cracking, physics-slinging, self-proclaimed smartass that never loses his scientific integrity; yet seems determined to master everything the world can possibly even suggest throwing at him while having an awful lot of fun."
"2071",2070,"Jillian","I read this for NPR's Science Friday Book Club. Yeah, I'm that kind of nerd, but somehow I wasn't at all familiar with Richard Feynman. I loved the complete lack of plot, the scientific vignettes and Feynman's unique thoughts on just about everything. His work on the Manhattan project and being a Nobel Prize winning physicist are folded into stories about bongo drums and hallucinations. It is truly a must read."
"2073",2072,"Paul Brantley","This was very entertaining. The stories Feynman tells. Wow, they show one of those over the top personalities. Think Jim Carey meets Carl Sagan with a touch of Richard Dawkins snarkiness. He truly was a great Physicist who did not take life too serious and loved to learn all the time, and pushed others to do the same. When I finished I just went back over it again laughing at his antics. It reminds my of Leon Lederman's ""The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?"" with Leon having conversations with people from the past visiting him at the Fermi Lab."
"2082",2081,"Al West","Richard P Feynman is a mathematician whose work in quantum physics in the 50's and 60's led the way to understanding that atomic particles were not stuck in space. Although not seen at the time QED shifted paradigms in thinking about the power of math and physics.His writing style although folksy draws the reader into his thinking about problem solving and ways to explore problems.His work on the STS 51 disaster was monumental thinking well beyond the rubber stamp preconceived ideas of other panel members including the chairman. This only came to light when he refused to sign the report which absolved Morton thyocol of responsibility so their part in the deaths of the astronauts one of whom was teacher Christy McCauliff.It was Feynman's thought processes formed during his early days including ""Surely You're Joking"" and ""What do you care"" that made him such a lateral thinking innovator. The big thing that comes from Feynman is that you can solve a lot of problems by reading books.  NOVA produced Feynman ""Portrait of a Genius"" a great documentary."

"2086",2085,"Karen Alley","This definitely makes the list of my favorite books of all-time. ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" is a glimpse into the mind of a bold genius who never stopped thinking, even when he wasn't working. Instead, he turned his mind to any pursuit that seemed interesting or amusing to him, whether that was picking locks, ferrying ants, or playing the bongos. The book is a collection of short stories written by Feynman himself, retelling some of the more interesting incidents in his life. The writing style is very conversational and accessible. The stories are often incredibly funny. At the same time, they offer new perspectives on seemingly mundane pursuits and occurrences. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with curiosity about the world we live in. "

"2092",2091,"Volodymyr Stoyko","Цю книжку мені стільки разів радив мій хороший друг Petro Nek, що просто гріхом вже було не прочитати. То ж в першу чергу я висловлюю йому подяку за те, що так часто згадував історії Фейнмана в розмовах. За паперовий примірник окрема подяка Rostyslav Kryvyy.Існує такий стереотип, що науковці - то неймовірні зануди, з якими нормальній середньостатистичній людині немає про що говорити. Можна далеко не ходити - на свята зустрічав товариша хіміка, розмова з яким - то просто таки величезна радість. Радість від того, що ти практично нічого не розумієш і, зважаючи на це, тобі намагаються донести інформацію в іншій, спрощеній формі, що, зрештою, не зменшує захоплення від почутого. Гадаю, фізики, як і хіміки, теж мають багато цікавих історій, пов'язаних не лише з наукою. Як от, Річард Фейнман, життя якого назвати нудним зможе лише повний невіглас. До речі, про розмови із занудними людьми - один з діалогів Фейнмана:- О, то ви фізик?- Так, фізик-теоретик.- На жаль, я нічого не тямлю у фізиці, тому ми не зможемо поговорити на цю тему.- О ні, поговорити на цю тему ми не зможемо, бо в ній тямлю я. Зате ми можемо говорити на тему, в яких ніхто з нас не тямить - прогноз погоди, високе мистецтво...Мені б хотілося позиціонувати себе як всесторонньо розвинену людину. І в цьому плані Річард Фейнман може стати чудовим кумиром. Та легкість, з якою він, будучи фізиком-теоретиком, брався за хімію, ламанння сейфів, малювання та багато інших сфер діяльності, доводить, що маючи щиру зацікавленість у чомусь - ви, якщо і не досягнете великих успіхів, отримаєте неабияке задоволення від процесу. Давно я так щиро не хвилювався за персонажа з книжки, давно так голосно не сміявся над неймовірними історіями, в які потрапляв Фейнман завдяки своєму ""ігровому"" підходу до всього, що посилав йому випадок.- На скільки Ви цінуєте життя?- Шістдесят чотири.- Чому Ви сказали шістдесят чотири?- А як, Ви вважаєте, можна виміряти цінність життя?- Ні! Я маю на увазі, чому Ви сказали «шістдесят чотири», а не «сімдесят і три», наприклад?- Якби я сказав ""сімдесят три"". Ви поставили б мені те ж питання!"
"2093",2092,"Priscilla Oppenheimer","Fantastic! Funny, interesting, educational, did I say funny? OK, yes Dr. Feynman was a bit of a sexist, but he was a product of his times, and even I, a sworn feminist, will admit that a man who is brilliant, irreverent, and charming can get away with a bit of sexism, as long as it's based on a love for women. (Some sexist men are that way because of hate and jealousy.) But I digress... The book is a great way to learn a little about physics, math, history, safe-cracking, puzzles, pranks, art, drumming, academia, you name it. The best parts of the book are when he's making fun of colleagues or institutions that are fake or stupid. I can't wait to read this book again."
"2097",2096,"Moshing Badger","Richard ""Dick"" Feynman is a notorious prankster, as well as a Nobel Prize winning physicist. Perhaps the greatest prank he ever played was composing a book where the reader requires no knowledge of either physics, or how to prank people. Rather, one requires only the desire to read this thoroughly hilarious and equally fascinating autobiographical story of one of America's most interesting and brilliant minds."
"2098",2097,"Carmel","Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman is a funny, entertaining memoir by the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, Richard Feynman. He describes the adventures of his life, from a twelve year old with a home-made lab to becoming a distinguished professor at the California Institute of Technology. The reader follows his travels and experiments, from Brazil to Japan to Los Alamos and Las Vegas. One can appreciate his no-nonsense view on life, his fascination with nearly every subject (except psychology), and the mischief that he gets into his entire life.As a high school senior who plans to major in engineering, I thought it was fascinating to read the life stories of such an obvious genius - and I can't help but wish that I was as smart as he was. I was inspired by his story to explore any opportunity that came my way, no matter how crazy it is, because that's how Feynman was able to meet so many interesting people and have fabulous adventures. If my career will be anything remotely like Feynman's, I'll be a very happy person.Read this book with an open mind; if you would be disturbed by an esteemed professor's attempts to pick up women, semi-illegal activities, and highly opinionated manner, this book isn't for you. If you're looking for a humorous read about someone who doesn't take life seriously, then you'll have fun with this book. You'll never view scientists as antisocial people again. Readers don't need any prior knowledge about math or science to understand the book, but if you are familiar with Feynman's work, you'll probably be able to appreciate his work even more. I can't compare it to any other memoir that I've read, because instead of focusing on a hardship, he talks about all the opportunities that he had and the people that he met. There isn't a real ""struggle"" that he has, though he does have some nasty things to say about textbooks and other professors. For example, there's one point where, in front of a panel of important people, he exclaims, ""The main purpose of my talk is to demonstrate to you that NO science is being taught in Brazil!"" I'm sure that many people will enjoy this book, and I highly recommend it!"

"2110",2109,"Mario","You just would not expect to encounter so many adventures by a theoretical physicist - the uniqueness of R. Feynman personality comes out stronger after each chapter, and he is still able to leave you with a ""can't believe that"" all the way through the end of the book.A deeper look provides extremely strong message to the reader: curiosity and perseverance, along with good brains and a big dose of luck can make you a winner in countless situations. This is my take away of this highly entertaining book, which should be read without the modern ""politically correct"" attitude in mind, or you will lose half of the fun."
"2111",2110,"Eduard","Liked author outlook on life."
"2113",2112,"Darius","This fun biography, written by a friend, but in Feynman's voice, talks about his myriad interests that go beyond physics: lock-picking, samba music, painting, hallucination, experiments with ants. The picture that emerges is of someone who was eager to try all sorts of experiences, and immersed himself with great joie de vivre. Clearly, in some of tales he tells, the other person in the tale would think of him as a pain in the neck: like when he insisted he be paid his 1 dollar for a patent, and the person gave it to him from his personal money. Still, nothing he narrates strays from being prankish... nothing ever vicious.He seems to have been willing to take social risks: volunteering to do things he was not quite ready for, or criticizing someone's holy-cow.The book contains a lot of implicit philosophy. His attitude toward life and science are refreshingly upbeat. There's also some great explicit commentary on epistemology and philosophy. They're scattered and the reader has to find what's offered and put it together; yet, it pays off. Given the nature of the book, it is hard to know if the author exaggerated, but even if it were completely fiction, it would be an enjoyable and inspiring read. "
"2114",2113,"Anirudh","A must read for student , Feynman was a incredibly talented person. In this book he tells his story from his perspective which is eye-opener to how his way of thinking. "
"2115",2114,"Sarah Sammis","I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It really gave dimension to a man I've heard so many stories about from my father in law. My husband got a kick out of seeing me read the book too. He had read it a few years ago and after I would finish a chapter he'd want to chit-chat about what I had just read."
"2116",2115,"Vahe Tahmazyan","Brilliant book!"
"2118",2117,"Chizu Nakamura","It was fun to know that one of the best mind in the history of science had various kind of interests and tried them by himselves. I also enjoyed episodes of his being in Japan. Some of his insights about how to learn maths will help me when I learn it and when I will teach maths to my daughter in the future. I became a his fan and want to read more about him. "
"2120",2119,"Linda Hart","Absolutely loved this book. It brought back wonderful memories of my physicist father, who knew Feynman."
"2125",2124,"Gabe","One of my favorite books. As I was reading it there were so many things about him that were so much like myself - the way he did things, things he did as a kid, his approach to solving problems, his interests - it was really bizzare to read. Later, after having read the book, I came to find out both our birthdays are May 11th."
"2126",2125,"Akshit Soni","This was read on a friend's recommendation.Even before I was finished all the way through the book ,I had made up my mind to rate it as I did it.In the beginning,it appears to be a waste of time reading memoir of someone.Bit that's where the fun lies I guess,especially with this one.Some things really leave those indelible marks in your memory to carry on further. This book carries something for everyone take away.It an eccentric mix of science,frivolity(mostly) and the innocuous nature of the author.There's a certain truthfulness associated.From his childhood adventures with science to drumbeating to painting and what not,Mr Feynmen is a grand package at your disposal.I even feel a certain amount of reverence for him till the end.There's something sagacious about most of what he says.All in all,I loved the book.Go for it."
"2127",2126,"Eddie Dobiecki","Understand this: ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" is not an autobiography--at least, not in the strictest sense. This is not an overview of his entire life. This is a series of anecdotes. It was compiled from a series of taped sessions, arranged for publication by a friend, Ralph Leighton, then edited by Edward Hutchlings. So it's not a comprehensive view of his life. It's a bunch of stories told by a gregarious fellow, anecdotes he thought were, for one reason or another, amusing or interesting. We don't have access to the tapes from which these stories came, so we don't know whether he also told stories that weren't about him, or how smart he was. So some who read this book think ""Hey, these are just stories that this guy thinks are interesting! That's not an autobiography at all!"" And they're right. But it's not really the book's fault for not being something it isn't. ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" is subtitled ""Adventures of a Curious Character"". And that's what it is. It's a series of adventures. They're told like reminisces, so they jump around in time on occasion. They're probably about as true as any collection of reminisces being told to you by someone at a party, which is to say I'm sure they're stretched a bit. But, so what? Some of the stories aren't great--on the one hand, he clearly had respect for his sister and I don't think he was directly misogynist, on the other hand he was willing to manipulate women to get what he wanted...once someone taught him how to do it. He also was a jerk to waitstaff--but I'm sure it was intended all in fun. He was a smartass. It happens. Some of the stories are fantastic, such as when he talks about how to make yellow paint, or about fixing radios ""by thinking!"" I think you need to take the stories as they're meant to be taken: reminisces about interesting things that happened to him, and times when his way of thinking either helped him or hurt him, and he learned something as a result. It's one of my favorite books, particularly the beginning and the end. When he explains his involvement in the Challenger explosion, it's rather interesting (though he goes into greater and more interesting detail elsewhere). "
"2132",2131,"Chris Moyer","Wonderfully candid. From insight into the building of the atomic bomb to dating and learning to draw, this book runs the gamut of Fenyman's life and is delightful and insightful throughout. "
"2133",2132,"Shivaraj karthikeyan","fantabulous book"
"2134",2133,"Audun Lode","This book encapsulates Feynman's way of being! It's like hearing him talk about physics, but he just sweeps you away on the adventure that was his life."
"2139",2138,"Aerospace Girl","Excellent read. An inspiring and amusing book of Feynman's anecdotes. The stories constantly pointing out that living one's own life takes a lot of ignoring the disparaging comments of the conventional mind."
"2140",2139,"Eric Flynn","A series of autobiographical anecdotes from the life of the father of modern quantum physics. Feynman is simultaneously witty, engaging and instructive. "
"2147",2146,"Olga Lempert","The book is full of a joy and a happy curiosity that is so contagious it is difficult not to catch. I found myself smiling as I read about the slightly Munchausen-like antics of this person who seems to have been good at everything, as has been pointed out in the comments above. My conclusion is not that Feynman was 'full of himself', but that it is possible for someone clever and invested to be good at many things at once. One merely needs to be curious and determined. Feynman put in a lot of work into every 'life experiment' described here, but the thing is that he enjoyed the process, not only the result."
"2157",2156,"David Levin","Really enjoyed this. What an original character. Also fun because it felt like a time capsule. He speaks in a specific 50's era way - at least that I recognize from 50's era movies - that's so different from how people speak now. But what a fresh perspective. Very fun. "
"2161",2160,"Kendall","So funny! What a character Richard Feynman was! "
"2162",2161,"Recursiveloop","Fantastic storytelling, constantly entertaining, and an interesting insight to some of the formative years of the US's technical prowess."
"2163",2162,"Saumya Biswas","The book has had little trouble in making it into ""My best books ever read"" list!"
"2164",2163,"December","I read him at just the right time: starting college, and he's partly responsible for my going into physics"
"2166",2165,"Mostafa","It is said that Feynman was smart. Sure, he was. But how much of his brilliance was due to his mother born, unique talent? I think very little of it. Read this book to find out what I mean. "
"2170",2169,"Amir.joudaki","this was certainly one of the most influential books I've ever read. because I'm emmpathetic with almost all the events in the book. Reading this marvelous story in a particularly difficult period of my life helped me better think about who I am and who I want to be."
"2171",2170,"Juan","Laughing out loud in the break room at work and I don't care.What I've taken away from this read is Feynman's free spirit attitude, curiosity and his absolute 'pleasure of finding things out'. His way of inquisitive thinking are so important to the way he interpreted the world around him, he couldn't have lived it any other way. His interest for new ideas and experiences should be something taught in schools and encouraged to anyone who wants the most out of lifeCheers, Mr. Feynman !(new hero)"
"2175",2174,"Kzrsosa ","Fun book about a peculiar scientist."
"2177",2176,"Bob Wasserman","The title doesn't lie - he's quite the character. While biographies usually aren't my thing, this was well put together and a very easy and enjoyable read. There was only a page or so when he dove into some detailed math equations that made no sense to me. But his endless curiosity and fervor for honest dialog and scientific investigation remain an inspiration. He experienced the curious mix that blends art, music and science in a very personal way."
"2179",2178,"Ajinkya Kulkarni","If this book does not make you fall in love with science, absolutely nothing else in this world will. Feynman was an exemplenary person besides being a science genius."
"2180",2179,"Niclas","Really liked it. Dr. Feynman writes in a very down-to-earth style, revelling the reader with stories from his extraordinary life :)"
"2183",2182,"David Vincent","This book has long sat on my to-buy shelf. Then other day--yeah!--I found it at Goodwill As-Is for a nickle. It's in terribly read condition, but sadly void of notes. I prefer books that have lots of notes. What an adventure it has been."
"2185",2184,"Mauricio Eguez","An excellent collection of stories from a life well lived. Most of the stories are very humorous, but with point to each one."
"2188",2187,"Dev","An awesome read. It is pure memoir of life by a genius and how he sees the world and how, he thinks the world sees him.It was great going through the adventures of Mr. Feynman on one side and his emotions for the condition of his wife on the other side. Mr. Feynman's perspective of world is very interesting.It is indeed another ""noble"" creation of Mr. Feynman"
"2190",2189,"Anastasia","Прекрасная книга о любопытстве, дотошности и честности, жаль только, что безобразно переведена."
"2192",2191,"Deb","Humorous and highly readable book of Richard Feynman..an amazing genius and winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics. What a character! He has been called "" a combustible mixture of high intelligence, unlimited curiosity, eternal skepticism, and raging chutzpah."" The short stories in this book will give you some insight into the working of his mind, and how his curiosity about EVERYTHING lead him into some unique adventures sprinkled among the more normal academic parts of his life."
"2195",2194,"Tem","excellent read about the life of one of the great physicists of this century. This book is unexpectedly easy to read and Feymann is such a likeable character with an infectious passion for understanding and exploring the universe."
"2197",2196,"Caner Demircan","Bittiğinde burukluk yaşadığım nadir kitaplardan biri. Eğitim sistemi, savaş politikası gibi ciddi konuları yaşanmış anılarla sivri bir dille eleştirirken eğlendirmeyi başarıyor. Richard Feynman'la arkadaş olmak lazımmış demekten kendimi alamadım."
"2199",2198,"Arjun","I'm surprised I never wrote anything for this. I first read this book almost a decade ago. It is one of my all time favorites. I re-read it from beginning to end every couple of years. I also sometimes spontaneously re-read my favorite parts. I find this book to be incredibly life affirming. My personality is very similar to Feynman's. I have an insatiable need to tinker with things and aggravate people. I really love all of Feynman's stories. Some of them are similar to my own stories. Like my father, one day I will write my best stories to share with the people I care most about."
"2201",2200,"Chelsea Ursaner","First off, this book really made me miss science, and physics in particular was my favorite. But if there is anyone that knows the predicament of being interested in many things and only having one life to live it is Richard Feynman. I had a constant smile on my face and laughed out loud quite frequently while reading.The author is listed as Feynman on the cover but on the front page it says “as told by Ralph Leighton, edited by Edward Hutchings,” and the three make a supreme team. You are instantly let in to his mind and character and, while the book is jampacked with little life lessons, the authors understood that they are often better left inarticulated. Sometimes in books like this the author feels the need to shove a lesson at the reader after every anecdote. More generally, I love that there was hardly any introduction or conclusion. The stories simply speak for themselves. Richard Feynman was an amazing person who had a wonderful way of living and looking at life. In some ways I feel I can emulate him - He is perpetually upbeat and good-hearted, and because of that he never has to worry about holding back from saying exactly what he thinks, which is basically how I feel. But in some ways I can only admire him – he is positively brilliant, and can truly understand the universe down to it’s most fundamental particles and forces. Lastly, I loved how the book ended (there are no spoilers here) and I vow here to always try to live a life of scientific integrity, as best I can. "
"2208",2207,"Yuriy.bylinkin","Прекрасная книга"
"2209",2208,"Prashant Sachdeva","A hilarious autobiographical account of events in Feynman's life. A must read."
"2211",2210,"Alex Rubenstein","Fantastically readable, humorous, and educational, all in one. It's an autobiography, yes, but in detailing anecdotes from his own life, Feynman's really provided some insight on how to be a better scientist, a more confident and well-rounded human that is true to oneself, and to have a keen eye that approaches issues with a dead-eye examination of why they are good or bad.How can we be better scientists? Avoid the cargo cult of pseudoscience that lacks the integrity of falsification and confirmation bias. How can we be more confident? Just ask if you want something! To be more well-rounded? Don't take a job if you feel it will be detrimental to your happiness. Be true to yourself and live only to your own expectations, not others. Feynman approaches life with a zest for experimentation and trying all of the most odd hobbies, yet he finds himself naturally lucky that his talents are utilized in some way. He is humble for sure, and it shows. I really think his luck is built up through experience, though.5 stars for a wonderful read of a truly curious character."
"2213",2212,"Will Sin","I actually read this book in its Chinese edition."
"2215",2214,"Jason Taro","A highly highly recommended book for everybody."
"2216",2215,"Nishant"," About: Anecdotes from the life of Nobel Prize winner, and the one acclaimed to be the greatest teacher of the millennium - Richard Feynman. Books if often hilarious, consistently ingenious, and more often than not - inspiring.How to Read: Flip across any anecdote and read it. This way it is much more fun that reading it cover to cover. Best read over several days, slowly absorbing the life of a genius."
"2218",2217,"Quanticcat","Impresionante, Increíble e Imprescindible."
"2223",2222,"Sandy Gallis","John and I listened to this book while driving around in the car. We both really enjoyed it because Mr. Feynman is quite a character for a physicist."
"2225",2224,"Dale W","What a fascinating character."
"2227",2226,"Abhishek","An insightful book into the life and times of one the brightest minds of this century . The ""magician"" with his engaging narration truly makes u flip through pages devouring the stories of his life . The hilarious pranks , the south American adventures , the science and his passion for it makes this an amazing read . A life worth knowing and read abt . A book worth buying and preserving ."
"2234",2233,"Martin Kocun","must read!"
"2235",2234,"Ashwani","It is an awesome book described as a series of short stories/anecdotes perfect for bathroom reading.Besides having some good memorable incidents from Feynman's life, it also contains some good thoughts for scientists. A must read book for all the prospective scientists."
"2236",2235,"Kristena","I loved this. Someone recommended it to me, and I was skeptical of reading an account about a physicist, even if he did take part in some very important projects. I was pleasantly surprised, finding it engaging and quite entertaining. Feynman is quite a character!"
"2238",2237,"Vibhuti","A really nice read! Some chapters do feel unnecessarily added but most of the book is a goodread. Many chapters are quite interesting especially the early life events of Feynman.Wish I had read it earlier.Will recommend it to any one who is even slightly invested in science, as rarely do you get to read books by some physicists (Nobel laureate) and that too in so simple a language."
"2239",2238,"Ramesh Naidu","Professor Feynman is an inspiration to read and a 20th century renaissance man that everybody should aspire to emulate"
"2241",2240,"Archana Singh","inspiring life. inspiring book. must read."
