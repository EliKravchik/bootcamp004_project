"18",17,"Radwa","من المفترض ان الكتاب ليس عن الحرب فقطو لكن عن الحياة بشكل عام .. لكنى بعد أول 50 صفحة حسيت أنى بقرأمذكرات قائد فى حرب .. ممكن انا مفهمتوشلكن حسيت بالملل نوعا ما"
"31",30,"Lorenz Chua","This book used a lot of hard vocabulary and sometimes was hard to understand. This book was only somewhat interesting because half of the time I was confused and couldn't get the full reading experience out of it."
"35",34,"Mark Papa","The rating reflects the terrible edition I read rather than the text. It wasn`t even this edition, but an Indian one with very poorly translated commentary published by Classic Library."
"36",35,"Leanne","Has a lot of quotable lines. The explanations by the translators were interesting."
"39",38,"Joseph Whitt","I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't this. For what it is, this book should be un-rateable. Sun Tzu provides his pubils with bulleted points of discussion organized throughout thirteen chapters of warfare topics. While at times it can be insightful, the bulk of the work feels ripe with zealous arrogance and is not without seemingly blatant contradiction. I do not pretend to understand the culture of the ancient Chinese, so this criticism is more directed at the concensus population who seem to admire the work as something to be studied. Take this book as a window into the life and times of the ancient Chinese warrior. Nothing more; nothing less."
"43",42,"Owen O'Neill","This is not a review of the book. That would be rather absurd. My rating is based on the place this book occupies, for (especially) American readers. There seems to be (or at least there was) this notion that reading The Art of War gave one insight into the ""Chinese way of War"" and the Chinese ""psyche"" or something. This is really not the case. The way we (Americans) view The Art of War and the way the Chinese view it (the PLA especially) are wide apart. It would take far too long explain this, so you may take my word for it or not, as you choose. However, the popularity of The Art of War among American readers has mostly to do with its appearance of ""accessibility"" to us. Its concepts appeal to our cultural views as to the way things ought to be done, veneered with a beguiling ""alieness"" that Clausewitz (and Jomini) lack. So quoting the The Art of War does (or once did) tend to get you trendy erudition points where Clausewitz just made you sound ""stuffy."" So read The Art of War for what it is worth. It is an interesting work. But I caution anyone against thinking they will learn much about Chinese thought on the subject by so doing."
"49",48,"Mientras Lees","De todos los mangas filosóficos que he leído hasta ahora (que son unos cuantos) ""El arte de la guerra"" es el que más me ha confundido y aburrido. Lo achaco a que soy un ignorante absoluto de la historia original en la que se basa el manga. De todas formas, creo que no está bien adaptado porque debería ser fácil de seguir tanto para gente que conoce a Sun Tzu como para quien no. "
"50",49,"Cagne","The translator writes in a difficult way, the intro was hard to get through. I liked the definition of order, courage and strength as weaknesses with an added element to balance them.I've heard recently Conan O'Brian talking about having had success by finding himself stuck in a situation without options so the part about incursions in enemy territory as a strong motivation resonated with it."
"51",50,"David Blaylock","The more I read classics that are must reads, the more I enjoy the stuff I pick out on my own."
"59",58,"Kucing","Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength.."
"69",68,"Wilhemina","It's better to read this in its original text. It's hard to appreciate the true meaning behind the original text in its translated form."
"70",69,"Jo Ann ","I am really sorry that I chose the audio over the real book. I don't blame the narrators, they have very nice story telling voices, and I have to commend them on their ability to pronounce all the different Chinese names. I also have nothing against Chinese philosophy. I actually admire how such an ancient book can still be applied to modern situations of today. Why I have decided to leave off is the author's style of presentation. I have listened to 4 of the 8 CD's and they all sound the same. It doesn't seem to matter which order you listen to them in, he basically repeats the same story over and over again. This is mind numbing. So I am giving this a 2 star rating not because of Sun Tzu's ancient writing, but because author John Minford does not know how to engage his readers."
"73",72,"Anusha Jayaram","Meh. That's all I could think. Almost throughout the book. Except for a few rare sentences here and there, everything else had me flipping through pages, wondering when the actual good stuff was going to begin. Having heard so much about this book - and quite a few teachers have made a mention of it in various classrooms - I was more than interested to see what it contained. It might've been extremely relevant at the time it was written, but I cannot see how it still is, today (contrary to what that book cover claims; that ""most of the truisms hold good even in today's world""). But honestly, even for those times, I couldn't help but find most of what I read painfully obvious. About not destroying cities, trying to capture them whole. About how a general should strike the right balance between being loved and respected / obeyed by his subordinates. About how one must always be prepared in order to ensure victory..This is yet another of those books which so many people have spoken highly of that I am unable to appreciate. I really don't like this feeling that I've perhaps missed something. But I cannot even make myself go through the volume again (thin as it may be) to check."

"85",84,"Scott Kinkade","Probably good for business people wanting to get ahead. I guess I just like a good yarn."
"91",90,"Eyad Zoudi","This is an overrated book. It is unfortunate that some business leaders say that this book inspired them. If you are a mob boss (such as Tony Soprano) or a military general, I do not blame you if get inspired by this book. However, if you are a business leader, please don't. We do not want see businesses destroying each others and spending their energy, focus and attention on attacking other companies. This will only lead to monopolistic market, which will absolutely hinder performance and creativity. As an example, the competition between Samsung, Apple and other mobile phones manufactures is what driving these companies to innovate, shape the future, and develop the new sophisticated mobile phones you and I love and use today. Companies and leaders must achieve and seize market share through striving to provide the best products and services to the market, not through monopoly. I bet that you read the news about the law suits between big companies due to stealing each other ideas, technology , etc... To get a bigger picture of what is happening there, you should read ""The Prince"" and not this book."
"99",98,"Vesna","I was expecting more then book offered. :/"
"107",106,"Jtrockla","As the rating implies...it was ok. Some people say that Sun Tsu's principles can be applied in real life, that his tactics and strategies have broader implications. If you stretch your imagination, you can see what those people are talking about. But in reality, those strategies can be impossible to employ in daily life. Choosing a defensive ground to limit the opportunities of your enemies to attack...engaging in battle only when the battle can be won. That's great...but sometimes you are stuck where you are and you have to fight through it.It is an interesting read...but not a must read. "
"113",112,"Delia Colangelo","I was always curious to read this book. My resistance to war though made it difficult to read.The strategies are probably relevant as metaphors on diplomatic or personal grounds, however when it comes to wars with weapons of mass destruction I have a hard time seeing the application .There is a constant expectation of having an enemy obviously , and the one of control throughout manipulation . I will just continue with Gandhi, Mandela, D Lama with the art of peace."
"131",130,"Quinn","LIttle bits of how to fight and win against an oposing army, city, force, etc. I thought it was pretty good, probably one of those books I'll keep at the office and pick up everyonce in a while when I need something for sales meeting training."
"133",132,"Laurann","This book is literally about how to fight in a war. It was interesting. For whatever reason I thought it was about business strategy. I guess I wasn't very well informed before I read the book. I suppose one could come the Art of War to business hence the books popularity. It was just ok. "
"136",135,"Jean-Luc","I'm sure it was useful in its time, but it is stunningly useless today. Read John Robb's ""Brave New War"" or anything by Mao instead."
"140",139,"Dan Bell","I was expecting more. Yes... it's clearly about war, but I thought more of the idioms could apply to universal truths. Instead, there were lengthy discussions about terrain and how movements of wildlife can show the tactics of a concealed enemy. Maybe I just didn't dote on each lesson hard enough. There were many profound truths, but the best of these I had seen quoted many times in other places."
"144",143,"Daniel Brewster","Didn't read all of it, but found some interesting tactics. For example -- actually, I'll keep them to myself :P"
"151",150,"Kevin Gee","THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN FROM THE WESTERN PERSPECTIVE ,,I HAVE ALSO SEEN THE MOVIE WHICH IS MADE IN MORE OF A EASTERN PERPECTIVE,,CAREFUL WITH THIS ( READING)."
"157",156,"John Carmichael","While I enjoyed the imperatives I did not like the constant interpretations of what previous translators put forth by this author (Bob Sutton Preface of the 1910 Lionel Giles version). It had to be done in order to preserve accuracy but it just made for hard reading."
"164",163,"Marco Savina","Epic ancient book of war in China, full of details. Powerful and colossal"
"167",166,"Nicholas Maulucci","a translated book that was difficult to read (from Chinese). there were nuggets here and there, but overall quite boring. all of the names and battles in the book were Chinese and difficult to follow. the book basically discussed war strategy, contrasting and comparing famous Chinese generals."

"179",178,"Aubrey","Gave a great deal of insight into the workings of the politically centered mind. Though the book was written hundreds of years ago, most of the information is still pertinent. However, the last chapter on how to effectively fight with flaming arrows might be a little useless..."

"192",191,"Chess via Email","Well, duh."
"200",199,"Ugh","My missus bought me The Art of War, I suspect because Tony Soprano reads it at one point in The Best TV Show Ever Made, preferring it to Machiavelli. Well, much as I appreciate the sentiment, Tony is the head of a mafia family, whereas I'm, well, I'm not. And while TAoW is much more concise and less repetitive than Marcus Auralius' Meditations, the first of the other two ancient books of wisdom that I've read, it's nowhere near as applicable to my life as the other one, Hagakure. Some of it is good stuff, and no doubt would be even more so if I was a high-powered businessman capable of doing some straightforward transference, but much of it relates to, for example, terrain, and my commute is pretty flat and largely free from confrontation now that I don't have to take the tube, so it's just not all that useful. It's also not as funny as Hagakure, as nowhere near as much of the advice culminates in decapitation. Ho hum.Favourite quote:There are five waysto attack by fire.The first is to burnmen;The second is to burnsupplies;The third is to burnequipment;The fourth is to burnwarehouses;The fifth is to burnlines of communication."
"202",201,"Bikoloni Biko","great insights in this book"
"220",219,"IreedGud","Not what I was looking for. I wanted something more like Karl von Clausewitz 'On War' which offers tangible and realistic military tactics, maneuvers, and stratagem. This just seemed like silly poems or anecdotes meant to teach lessons. I read this a few years ago but one of his stories in short was something like ""build a large dam up river... get your enemy to cross the river...and once his army is halfway across then break the dam and split the army."" You know, just make the other army do exactly what you want them to do then set a booby trap. This is why China is known for building a massive wall to keep out armies (mongols, who had legitimate battlefield tactics) and why they are not famous as military tacticians."
"227",226,"Adrian Oprean","""Cunoaște-ți dușmanul, cunoaște-te pe tine însuți, victoria ta nu va fi niciodată amenințată. Cunoaște terenul, cunoaște condițiile meteorologice, victoria ta va fi totală"".Nu cred că aveam nevoie să citesc cartea asta. E overrated și inutilă, oarecum. Ar putea fi utilă din prisma informațiilor istorice pe care le oferă (dar datorită ușurinței cu care sunt redate, par neverosimile). De asemenea, nu cred că se pot generaliza în felul în care o face Sun Tzu: Dacă faci x, câștigi, dacă faci y, pierzi. Z a făcut asta și a câștigat.Încerc să gândesc mai larg și să încerc să aplic unele din informații în viața cotidiană, dar îmi dau repede seama că niciun eveniment nu e constrâns de o singură condiție. Unele sfaturi pot fi utile, dar universul este condus prin teoria haosului. Ori viața nu poate fi condiționată de o singură variabilă, ci de o sumă de variabile iar majoritatea nu pot fi controlate."
"233",232,"Sikander","Most of the strategies discussed in the book can also be applied in our competative lives in the field of work. But from the military point many subjects discussed in the book are irrelavent since it all talk about conventional warfare which is not the order of the day. Present days military battles are fought on a totally differnt strategies. But I wonder what Sun Tzu would have had said if he lived in present day? What would be his commentary for today when battles are fough with mechinary only?"

"274",273,"Aidan","This is a book held in high regard by some of the most boring people I know.Still, I figured I should give it a try, and see what this Sun Tzu character has to say. After all, if it survived 2500 years, then it must do something right.To understand my frustration, let me give you the three types of statements in this book.1. The absurdly obvious. Here, Sun Tzu will state something that any three year old could have figured out, then act like it's the most ingenious thing ever. I don't care how old it it, NOBODY could ever have needed this. It typically sounds something like, “If your enemy is about to slaughter your entire army, you must consider taking preventative measures that prohibit him from doing so” REALLY? REALLY SIR? I thought if my enemy was about to destroy me, I should whine piteously and hold up a copy of your 15-page tract as a shield.2. The WAAAAAAY too specific. Here, Sun Tzu thinks you really need to know what to do if your troops are in a swampy marshland with mountains behind you and a river less than five miles to the North-East of you while your enemy (who favors an advance guard) is advancing at the right of 0.3 miles per hour towards your left flank. I don't care who you are, this is a situation that requires improvisation and nothing else.3. The out-of-left-field poetry. Sounds like, “O praise heaven for subtlety, for it like the moon has five seasons like the color of the green dragon emperor!” What? I'm sorry, could you repeat that in a fashion that makes sense to someone other than yourself?I should also add that the “very specific military tactics”, which is the only reason I could bump this up to two stars, only work if you assume your enemy is a total moron who can't plan a single move in advance. If they got their hands on a copy of Sun Tzu, he's negated himself.So: Should you read this? Sure, why not. It's always important to know how people have thought, and it's hard not to respect something so old. Besides, it'll only take you 30 minutes at worst. But is this going to help you, Mr Businessman (seemingly all of Sun Tzu's demographic)? Nope. There's just too little here of any merit. I know this is an unpopular opinion, and I sort of apologize, but I also don't."
"276",275,"Sofia","interesting but very dry. commentary from other parties is longer than the actual 'art of war'. some of the commentary helps comprehension of the text but also systematically interrupts the flow of reading, even in mid sentence. might be easier or more pleasurable to read as a paperback with the notes added to the end or as footnotes.."
"283",282,"Orkida Dragoti","Not so good. Expected more."
"284",283,"Eyad Abu-Zaid","كنت ف يوم باتفرج علي مسلسل فاميلي جاي وكان ستووي بيقرأ كتاب الأمير لماكيافيلي فقالDamn you Machiavelli , Tell me something I don't know !فساب الكتاب وجاب كتاب فن الحرب وقعد يقرأ فيه .فافتكرت الكتاب بيتكلم عن نفس الموضوع ، لكن كل التعليمات فيه كانت حربية ، بعضها يصلح للحياة الشخصية لكن الكتاب في مجمله حربي فماستفدتش منه زي كتاب الأمير ."
"285",284,"Shanna Kunkel","Wasn't a fan "
"299",298,"Black&white","It is certainly a very interesting work from a historical point of view and it was the major work for its field for a long time. This book details “The Art of War” meaning just that it proposes military strategies, battle formations, how to se the environment to your advantage etc.It is an old military manual and honestly nothing else as far as I could see. Most people who read it today have somehow gotten the bizarre idea that this is somehow a selfhelp book to deal with your personal life, a mystical source of wisdom,… Management people cite it, New Age self-help gurus quote it and that one guy at work has proclaimed it to be his life philosophy. I really think that all of those people are looking too much into this book and imagining to many things. That part about fighting formation is just that and even as a book on warfare it has become probably largely useless for modern warfare. People might as well pick up a 2000 year old book on botanist and proclaim it the path so self-fulfilment. Yes there are quite a few parts here that you could apply outside of the battlefield but most of them came across as pretty logical and rudimentary. Just to give you an example: “If you know both yourself and your enemy, you can win numerous battles without jeopardy.” Well yes but isn’t that just the logical thing to do? Even outside of a literal battlefield? "
"306",305,"X","An interesting read, but unfortunately, many of the topics touched upon are too vague and simple. Sad to say, aside from the chapters on fire and espionage, many people who play tactics video games will already understand many of the points. Also, all the points are too broad, and the book is generally lacking in examples and detailed explanations."
"312",311,"Gustavo Martins","Faz eu querer jogar Total War! :)"
"313",312,"Esmeralda","Ancient Chinese dynasties could have up to four different borders to worry about in the cycles of conquest. This lead to scholarship- Sun Tzu (and much later American hip hop) spouting leadership techniques, style. Reading about the outdated ways of waging war using horses, swords is such a contrast to contemporary war. Those little contrasts are fun to think about. As in, the American flag was held by the brave leader on the horse. They went around the street in Afghanistan and the flutte players announced the war with song.One noble principal gleaned: to wage a war without blood shed is ideal. "

"328",327,"Tom Dale","However regrettably, the military, it would appear, does not always attract the best and brightest to its ranks, which may go some way to explain the 'enduring classic' status of a manual of the bleeding obvious. That it should have also in recent times have become bible to the corporate go-getter perhaps says something similar about that group."
"333",332,"Kevin Powe","The author's fairly prosaic take on the text seems to focus a lot on the relationship between warlord and ruler, rather than the act of organisation of forces. Overall, I think the translation suffers from his focus, and by trying to remove what he sees as ambiguity, he removes a lot of what is worthwhile to ponder in Thomas Cleary's translation.From looking at the afterword, I see that he's done a translation of the Book of Five Rings, as well. I'd be far more interested in his translation of that work, given that it focuses more on individual struggle, which is relevant to his experience as a martial artist.Overall, not impressed. Not every great warrior is automatically a great writer."
"337",336,"Derrick","An interesting book, written with just short quips of information but it still seemed to flow rather seamlessly. A decent book with some good info, some of it could be still used today some of it would obviously not apply anymore to today's wars. A good read, enjoyable, and really quick."

"361",360,"Alyssa De Guzman","At first glance at the book cover, it may seem like an easy-to-read book and is short. And it will definitely attract people who would just want to have a gist of what the art of war is all about.However, it is not at all easy-to-read because it used a lot of hifalutin words.And, if the book aims to give the readers a gist, I believe that it succeeded. I believe it just given the surface of what the art of war is talking about and not discussing the themes/topics in details for the readers to comprehend the reason behind the topic."
"382",381,"Nat","Well, that sure was boring. Lots of common sense presented through bad metaphors. I was expecting something a bit more ground breaking, I guess."
"388",387,"Denisse Garza","Le pongo 2 estrellas y no 3 por que el lenguaje no me atrapó, por que es muy repetitivo y por que muchas cosas son sentido común, cosas demasiado obvias que no le veo la sabiduría.

Por momentos se entiende aquellos en que hace mucho calor por días se entiende aquellos cuando se levantan los vientos""Vale la pena leerlo por la importancia del libro, lo famoso que es, y por que en verdad es demasiado corto y no te tomará tiempo. Pero no hay mucho valor en él. No creo que sea cierto lo que dicen que este libro es aplicable en todos los aspectos de nuestras vidas. Eso es usar DEMASIADO la imaginación de uno.Para ser un experto en las conspiraciones e intrigas, mejor lee el Príncipe de Maquiavelo y Las 48 leyes del Poder de Robert Greene."
"389",388,"Facedeer","Perhaps Sun Tzu's insights were revolutionary at the time, but reading his book now in hindsight a lot of it is really just common sense. And although a lot of folks in modern times like to apply it to things other than warfare in ancient China it takes quite a bit of interpretation to make things line up - at which point, again, it's really just common sense.So this is an interesting read from a historical perspective, but I suspect that as a guide for most modern activities it'll just provide a bunch of parables and platitudes rather than anything really deep."

Sure, there are business school professors who put it on a management reading list to be used as some metaphor for conquering the business world, but they do that arbitrarily, because that's not what this book is about. It's not a how-to manual for doing anything but succeeding at war. There are some scattered truisms about preparation and leadership, but they only serve to illustrate larger points about, you know, winning wars, and if you're looking for real insight on those topics, there are far better books to read. So of course you can overlay it onto anything and treat it like an extensive metaphor for whatever you'd like, but also, why would you do that?

It has been a year since I have read the book and I am still perplexed on what the author is saying."
"517",516,"Chad Warner","I've often heard this ancient text referenced in a business context. Sun Tzu's lessons about war are often applied to business strategy, competition, marketing, and leadership. Among the outdated, specific advice and observations about foot soldiers, weaponry, and terrain, Sun Tzu explains several timeless concepts about combat that can apply to business or personal life.The main theme is to know yourself, know your army, and know your enemy. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of all parties, you'll be more likely to make decisions leading to victory. Tzu also recommends using deception whenever possible to confuse the enemy and take them by surprise. He doesn't declare fleeing from battle as cowardly, but as a practical alternative to fighting when the odds are against you.Tzu stresses planning before moving and basing decisions on reason, not emotion. He says that the secret to an effective army is to strike a balance between humane treatment and discipline.I didn't find the book revelatory or entertaining, but it was worth listening to simply because it's so commonly referred to. I listened to the The Art of War from LibriVox, translated by Lionel Giles."

I know I should have given this skilled effort a better rating... but to be honest, I just wasn't interested.

"719",718,"Lauren Brown","After reading ""The Art of War"", by Sun Tzu, I can’t help but feeling a bit let down. Perhaps it was all the wonderful things that I had heard about this book, that lead me to believe that after I had finished I would have obtained some sort of secret insight into successful business strategies. I did not find this to be the case. Perhaps it was the fact that I’ve already read many motivational books such as ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People"" by Steven Covey and Joel Osteen’s ""Your Best Life Now"", that have been credited with being, at least in part, some contributing piece of framework for these books that left me feeling less than satisfied. Maybe I can link my disappointment to the fact that I have acquired knowledge of natural topographical advantages and disadvantages through my career as a Land Surveyor. Either way, I kept reading through this book looking for the “hidden jewel,” never to find it. I want to qualify this with the statement: ""The Art of War"" is a good book, but it is not profoundly life changing. I think that the tactics and principals given by Sun Tzu are solid and effective. They are written very concisely and direct, which is nice. If this book is on your “must read before I die” list, I really think that you should go ahead and read it; it won't take long, I promise! Certain parts have the potential to speak to different people in a way that they did not to me. Overall, this is a short easy read. It would make a nice gift to someone heading off to college or leaving home for the first time. It is a great introduction for those still looking for direction."

It's good to do this, it's bad to do that.""I went into this very open minded and excited because it's regarded as a MUST READ before you die.

"833",832,"Brandi Donaldson","This was not my favorite book, but its only because I am not interested in this topic. I do however appreciate the ideas and reasoning behind Sun Tzu's tactics in war. He describes in detail in each chapter how one prepares for battle, how one approaches battle, and how one behaves/acts in battle. My favorite chapter was the one about terrain. He goes into detail about the importance of maintaining your grounds, hiding, and spying on the opponent. Most importantly is to work with the terrain in order to fight swiftly to win. Do whatever your opponent is not thinking or doing. It is important to get in their heads just like it is to know where mountains or valleys are. It is clear how they are successful. However, to me this was not a story that I could relate to or one with enough dialogue to keep me interested. It is not fictional in the sense that there are relationships and romance. It is more of a war and ""be smarter and act quick"" type of book on how to fight, outwit, and succeed."

I did find interestingone of the chapters (which run anywhere from 1-3 pages long) which dealt with not only how to confuse the enemy by your actions, but also your subordinates. This must be the chapter CEOs and managers like, as its often adopted by managers. This may be a fault with Mr. Tzu (pardon my formal informality) in that it contradicts a tenet he espouses early which is if the command isn't clear it's the commanders fault.

"1187",1186,"Marcos Zoquier","Descargué este libro solo por pura curiosidad. Cuando lo abrí por primera vez me sorprendió ver que solo tenía unas 80 páginas. me puse a investigar y al parecer no lo descargué mal. Otra cosa que me sorprendió fue ver lo fácil que era la lectura (considerando que tiene más de 2mil años de antigüedad),doy por sentado que la traducción tuvo mucho que ver con eso, pero no dejó de ser una sorpresa.Estamos ante un clásico que según dicen inspiró mentes como la de Napoleón y Maquiavelo. El Arte de la guerra es un libro más antiguo incluso que la biblia. Me puse a leerlo esperando algo denso y aburrido pero fue fácil de leer y empezó con muchas citas geniales. ''Donde hay grandes recompensas hay hombres valientes''''Si utilizas al enemigo para derrotar al enemigo, serás poderoso a cualquier lugar donde vayas''Ya sé que esto no es un cuento, mucho menos una novela,pero me pareció una especie de libro de superación personal aplicado a la guerra y lo que fue agrado al principio se convirtió en algo un poco irritante. Creo que esto se debió a la traducción más que nada, o eso quiero creer."

"1207",1206,"Carlos Gomez Honig","The Art of War is a Chinese military treatise that was written during the 6th century BC by Sun Tzu. Composed of 13 chapters, each of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare, it has long been praised as the definitive work on military strategies and tactics of its time.The Art of War is one of the oldest books on military strategy in the world. It is the first and one of the most successful works on strategy and has had a huge influence on Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, and beyond. Sun Tzu was the first to recognize the importance of positioning in strategy and that position is affected both by objective conditions in the physical environment and the subjective opinions of competitive actors in that environment. He taught that strategy was not planning in the sense of working through a to-do list, but rather that it requires quick and appropriate responses to changing conditions. Planning works in a controlled environment, but in a competitive environment,"

"1224",1223,"Rat","In the words of the book's own introduction this is ""an ancient and sometimes enigmatic text and works best when we let it seep into our consciousness over several readings"". Having read it once, I do suspect that will be true. A certain period of cognitive marination may benefit the reader. As such, writing this review, now - having read the book in its entirety within the space of about an hour and a half (the book is relatively short - so re-reading should be relatively painless) - I may not be being terribly fair. Considering the conciseness, it does encompass a breadth/scope of often deep concepts, so I think a certain degree of pondering will flesh things out and make it more worthwhile. Besides, it's eminently quotable, which is no bad thing. :)Worth a read.. probably worth a few.. but not ever likely to be a ""favourite"" of mine.

"1260",1259,"El","The Art of War is often referenced in other books and movies as being a great source of information on how to strategize in business as well as war. I believe Donald Trump has raved about it more than once as something that has helped him build his, um, ""empire"".The first section is the Lionel Giles' translation of Sun Tzu's masterpiece; the second section is also Lionel Giles' translation of Sun Tzu's masterpiece, with his own interpretations interspersed throughout the reading. Essentially one gets to read The Art of War twice, the second time taking longer because of the notes after every couple of statements.While interesting to read in a historical sense, reading it today for anything other than its historical context smells a little fishy to me. As usual a classic piece of literature has been taken, re-worked, re-interpreted and totally blinged out to pigeonhole it so it is somehow pertinent to society now. In this case it was adopted by business moguls as a way to learn how to become ruthless men and women. Granted there are a couple of ""leadership"" discussions that could be useful in an office setting, but ultimately they are generally common sense sorts of issues: If the leader is weak, the soldiers will be insubordinate.Really?Other things, such as not fighting in the brush or in water, are so painfully obvious that it's hard for my crusted-up third eye to open. People comment on the genius of Sun Tzu's words, which may have packed more of a punch 2500 years ago than it does today, but people also comment on Yogi Berra's genius as well. When asked about the things Yogi Berra would say that were considered to be deep and profound, he would often remark that he had no idea he was being clever. He was just commenting on obvious facts, that's how his brain works.Reading The Art of War now reminded me a lot of that. Maybe Sun Tzu was just an early Yogi Berra."

"1271",1270,"David Smith","Meh. I learned more in my 2 credit R.O.T.C. course. Also everybody says you should read this for business management, but not really. Economics says cooperate to get rich.

All you can do is know yourself and your enemy, and then make a good decision about whether to go forward, if at all. Also, it brings up getting tired a lot, how you shouldn't do that, and how you should try to make the other guy tire out."
"1277",1276,"Ishan","Interesting book to read if you take into context when the actual text was written down. A small glimpse of China's rich history not recognized by the West."
"1279",1278,"Meghan","This rating is strictly for the translation version of this book, rather than the book itself.The Art of War is a book on military strategy. Yet, the concepts within it can be applied to modern business and to some extent, every day problems. However, it's basically a military strategy guide. So in that respect, I found the content a little boring. I will say though that the concepts themselves are hardly foreign ideas, which goes to show how pervasive this book is in modern life. Just about every self-help guru teaches these concepts (although they may not realize it). So kudos to the Chinese for writing it all down first.Now a word on this translation. I hate this translation. I can't say it's any worse than any other translation because I haven't read any other one. But from reading other translated works, I don't appreciate the work done here at all. Having a little understanding about how the Chinese language works, I feel like the melody and fluidity of the work has been lost. And I have read other Chinese-translated works, so I know it's not just a Chinese-to-English issue.But worse are the ""commentaries"", which I feel are completely misleading, as I bought this specific book because I thought the commentaries would give me deeper understand of the text. I read their explanation for the ""purpose"" of the commentaries and have to agree whole heartedly. Their object is ""less definitive interpretation than an opening of the text so that its greater meanings can be exposed."" (p. 228) Unfortunately, greater meaning was not exposed. All they did was translate the text from Chinese to English, then in the commentaries, restate the English text in a more English-style format. Very rarely did I as the reader feel like I was given something that helped me gain deeper appreciation for the work. How to apply this concepts (besides in war) would be more useful to the modern reader. Or if this is to be used strictly as a military strategy guide, then less emphasis on the application and uses of this text in other areas should be made in the beginning of this book. And I point this out because you have to have a much lower intelligence than the population on a whole if you can't understand the basic concepts that the translated works give.""Therefore--Not knowing the strategies of the feudal lords, one cannot ally with them. Not knowing the form of mountains and forests, defiles and gorges, marshes and swamps, one cannot move the army. Not employing local guides, one cannot obtain the advantage of the ground.[Denma's commentary:] Without knowledge one cannot act skillfully. Knowledge must come from every available source and extend to all aspects of the enemy."" (p. 168)Did I as the reader really need this 'comment'? I think it's pretty clear from the original text the ideas that Sun Tzu is trying to convey here. I would have greatly preferred a comment on how the various experts think this can be applied, especially in modern times (even in modern warfare).Overall, I understand why this book is considered such a classic. It's use in today's world is everywhere. And I appreciate that I have a better understanding of where these thoughts and ideas came from--their roots so to speak. However, I would highly recommend finding a better translation as I feel this one failed in every aspect a reader could want (other than it was translated into English)."

(2) Which of the two generals has most ability? (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? (5) Which army is stronger? (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained? (7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?"" (1:13, Giles Translation)If you are underwhelmed by the insight of these questions then you understand the essence of my feelings about Art of War. Despite occasional high points, this perennial classic is so full of trivial, if not contradictory, advice that it was decided by my book club that a wily general wrote it to confuse bureaucrats so much they'd stay out of his way. This is, of course, written into the tome as #5 of the five essentials of victory: ""He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign"" (3:17). Going through The Art of War, it can be enlightening to pick out themes and follow them, context actually matters not at all:In 1:18, it says that ""All warfare is based on deception."" 3:2 says ""Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.""7:15 says ""In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed."" 10:31: ""Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete."" 13:27: ""Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results...""To summarize: Duplicity is the most important art of war because it means you can win without engaging in battle because you know the enemy's weak points, so basically...Have spies and use them! However, let's not forget that ""You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked"" (6:7). Reading statements like the above amid advice to, for example, let the enemy face the sun when attacking (9:13) or think before making decisions (12:21) does not rid me of the feeling that the majority of the ""insights"" in The Art of War could have just as well been easily deduced today by an author or group so-motivated. I'd like to think otherwise, so I ask, is the problem in the translation? I read Thomas Cleary's translation with commentaries by later scholars (which were sometimes more interesting then the text itself and sometimes totally off-the-wall). Did the state of knowledge about warfare change so much that the majority of what was at one point profound is now plainly obvious? Or maybe my expectations were too high? I have, after all, seen the countless spin-offs on topics such as business, and dating. I didn't miss the zen moments, and certainly found some parts of the book to appreciate. Finally, however, I find that The Art of War's outsized influence has, in the end, diminished the original. "

Each piece of advice was followed by a short explanation or repetition by another Master of what Master Sun had just stated. When did this format end? When the book ended. As Sun was allegedly the Master, I eventually started just reading Sun's comments which allowed me to get to the end much quicker. At least now I can truthfully say that I did, in fact, finish reading the book. I marked one sentence in the book to be added to my review but now I can't find it."

It has been passed studied worldwide by militaries, historians, students, and not surprisingly the business world. Sun Tzu, a famous and innovative military expert gave sound advice on every aspect of waging war imaginable. The thirteen chapters included range from how one must plan an attack, the key to spying, how not to underestimate the enemy, and how to assess resources and the surrounding area (terrain/landscapes). Being a child of a military parent I never took the time out to see what war was about and what skills my father had to obtain to serve our army. But reading Sun Tzu’s novel allowed me to look through different eyes. Now that I’m older its easier to see that war is more complicated than just two people not getting along. I realized early on that this writing could be taken both metaphorically and literally. I will admit that it was not my favorite read of this semester, but it helped me to take it metaphorically and relate to my own life experiences (college, relationships, friends etc). On example of how I was able to relate is through his lesson of knowing one’s enemies and having a good sense of self. I interpreted it, as it is not good to go into competition with opponents without having an idea of their skills/strategies. Knowing your opponent is the best way to better a person’s own strategies/skills. I was able to see this through my experience with dance and entering dance competitions with other dance schools. Sun Tzu has a way of teaching his audience the qualities that should be found in a leader. He shows how discipline can carry a person a long way in the ways of warfare and in the end can lead to victory. Another important lesson is that if victory is not reached it does not give a person a reason to give up. One must keep fighting. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in history particularly one of the top picks for Asian literature. "

"1854",1853,"Rishi Garg","I struggled through the annotated version in order to receive scholarly thoughts on applications of the philsophy in one's own life (outside of war). However, the annotations all described applications to war and military strategy. The last chapter, on spying and espionage stood out, not because it was overly thrilling, but because it is amazing to think that such strategies span thousands of years. The concepts of Dao, which thread throughout the entire book, and Yin and Yang which appear seldom but leave a heavy mark, will require more thought before arriving at their relevance outside of the art of war context. "
"1864",1863,"Paulisa Smith","Honestly, I wasnt too in love with this book. This book is not about adventures, mysterys, or even historical fiction. The Art of War is strictly about different tatics and strategies on how to do just that: Win a war. I read this as a requirement for one of my classes, and the only thing that got me through this was being able to relate his war strategies to my own life. Though, if I was interested in politics, or becoming a general or apart of the army then I would have been thrilled. I do admit that a lot of Tzu's advice and ideas were very interesting. This was translated in english in 1910, i have to wonder if the war tatics have changed from the 1700s, 1900's, to now when the idea of warfare was to kill as many people as possible. Sun Tzu offers his ideas over 13 chapters which focuses on certain aspects such as Military Combat, Waging War, Planning Offensives, and Manuevering the Army. Though I am not interested in war, I thought that a lot of his tatics made sense. You could understand the importance of certain things without being a military combat expert.""All warfare is based on deception"" ""Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.""""But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.""A lot of people, and even myself value Sun Tzu's ideas because this book has been exsistence for over 2000 years. Do not read this expecting an adventure book. "

"1910",1909,"propellermann","Before I read this book I've heard alot about it. Many people refer to it as a ""must read"" and a classic of ancient chinese literature. Also it is often named as an example for very old strategies helpful in your modern daily life. The guy who wrote the foreword of the edition I read goes on. He mentions that if he was ruling, he would oblige every head of state in the world to read it. So I decided to read it as well....and got very confused, asking myself what in my modern daily life the advice, not to attack upwards a hill could be helpful for. Even if I was a head of state.So I thought about it a while, I may just didnt got the the deep wisdom behind this and all the other advices in this book. But I still didn't concieved it, so I decided that it's the book's fault.Even if you want to make war, this wouldn't be as helpful as thinking about your strategy by yourself in context of your own situation. Or asking somebody knowing one's stuff.By myself I got more useful tricks for competing some enemies, and not essentially military ones, from Harro von Senger's ""Book of Strategems""."
"1922",1921,"Brock Spore","Read a cheap-o copy on my kindle so kinda sucked."
"1925",1924,"Austen","I hoped to get more from the Art of War than I did. I hoped to find in this translation of the ancient text metaphors and symbolic formulations that I could apply to my own life. In particular I hoped to find ways to overcome the challenges in life that we create in our minds. I also hoped to find ways to become a better drummer: stronger, clearer of mind, more fearless. Perhaps I expected too much. I think this text bears more heavily upon those who seek to excel in adversarial endeavors, such as sports, big business, and of course, in actual combat. Sun Tzu belonged to a lineage (or clan) that maintained and passed along specialized knowledge about weapons and warfare, and as such, were contracted or hired by various rulers for this knowledge. And it is this text that spells out how a state is to find success should it find itself engaged in war with another army. He relates all the ways in which (consisting of how an army scores in relation to certain principles) a general can know with certainty the outcome of any battle. These include such factors as the obedience of an army, the type of terrain upon which the armies occupy, the invaluable role that spies play in winning wars, and even the duration of military campaigns.All of the ideas are broken into short phrases--some of which are very specific, and some of which are quite esoteric, philosophical, even poetic. Sun Tzu's statements about things such as different types terrain, how spies are to be treated, how a general is supposed to conduct himself in the presence of his men are interesting, sort of, but not quite what I hoped to find. What I am left with is the idea that protracted war is to be avoided at all costs (from which I extract a sort of philosophical meaning), and that if one knows oneself and one's enemy, one should not fear the outcome of a thousand battles. On should never fight a battle when one knows little about oneself or one's enemy.I think my ""enemies"" in this life (if I can say that I have any) are much more abstract than a person, a country, or a competitor. My enemies are fear, hatred, negativity, and ignorance, and in some cases lie within me. As such, I have to be informed when I confront them so that I do so without fear. Yet, there are times when I cannot confront my enemies--there are times when it is best only to hold ground, or times when it is better to retreat so as to fight another day. This is what I take from the Art of War. "
"1935",1934,"Nate Markham","not really as great as its reputation. read it when i was a kid even before the bone thugs album!"
"1943",1942,"Nick Klagge","Was not very impressed with this at all. It was the successor to ""Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius"" as my iPod/subway book, but not as enjoyable. First of all, nearly half of the edition I had was editorial notes interspersed with the text. I guess the text itself isn't really long enough to justify a whole book on its own. And second, I feel like it didn't really offer me any new insights. It reminded me somewhat of ""The Wealth of Nations"" in having some interesting wisdom mixed in with long boring parts. But Sun Tzu is considerably less organized than Adam Smith, and what's more, I feel like the main interesting insights of this book have been so sublimated into American cultural awareness that they didn't feel fresh to me: win the battle by fighting on your own terms, know your enemy as well as you know yourself, etc. I feel like I had a much better experience of learning about military strategic and tactical thinking by reading, for instance, Shogun, and probably the same would be true of Lawrence of Arabia (though I haven't read that). I much prefer reading a narrative of Toranaga/Tokugawa's military coup to having its key insights boiled down (and all the motivation boiled away).Next iPod/subway book: Epictetus."

"1959",1958,"Timothy","For every one line of translated text of Sun Tzu there's a few dozen rambling sentences covering various interpretations by other translators, as well as off-topic quotes from General Baden-Powell and Stonewall Jackson. About 80% of the book is [bracketed] commentary by the translator.Here's my paraphrased example: When raiding or plundering [this reminds me of something Napoleon did, now I'm going to write several paragraphs discussing Napoleon, because the French troops lived off the land as they marched and occupied new territories. Blah blah blah, Zulu tribes, blah blah, French Revolution] be as fire [the Romans used fire, let's talk about fire now and how awesome it is to throw fire at your enemies]Meanwhile, the actual Sun Tzu portion was ""when raiding or plundering, be as fire"". Which, first of all, is nonsensical, and secondly, this is a terrible index into historic accounts of war strategies. I enjoy reading history, but this is not a useful context to understand Napoleonic wars or the American Civil War (which the translator frequently cites).The actual ""Art of War"" portion from Sun Tzu is perhaps a bit out of context in modern society, I mean, it's kind of cool that I know how much silver is required per day to raise on army of 100,000 Chinese soldiers circa 500 BC [1000, apparently it costs 1000 ounces of silver per day]. And it's pretty awesome that I know when to behead the Emperors concubines to properly motivate the rest of the harem in a mock military exercise [warn them once, then behead]... but somehow this makes me worry when people reading Art of War tell me how applicable it is to modern life."
"1965",1964,"Lily","If you've ever picked up a self-help book where the author is repeatedly stating the obvious, then you've experienced the writing style of this book. The overall concepts could've been summarized in a short essay rather than a book. Its length is a testament to its antiquity, though the author has done a noble job of re-ordering and editing bits of the chapters to provide continuity and to delete repetition.Oriental philosophy is often ripe with a kind of double-speak and this book is no exception.The main idea, covered ad nauseam, are that generals must be wise, adapt to changing situations, and maintain order.What people get out of this book is whatever they want to read into it. It was an alright read but, in general, the book is overrated."

Several people see its relevance in today's world too, which unfortunately eludes me. I am curious about the part where Tzu attributes all military failures to be caused by one of these five factors: recklessness, cowardice, a hasty temper, a delicacy of honor, and over-solitude. I'd be very interested to explore some famous battles in history, in light of his wisdom. A moving part of the book was where he writes, If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.

Its ancient, oriental provenance adds to its cachet, but it is largely a list of truisms, and if you need a book to learn them you shouldn't be in charge of anyone, especially an army. This edition in its ebook format probably didn't help my appreciation as it resulted in a very fragmented reading experience, with lots of interpolated comments about generals through the ages. The period of it's translation (early 20th century) also adds a somewhat patronising/colonialist tone to some of the comments. It's one of those classic ""must reads"" I suppose, but after having done so I am left with the question ""why?"" Probably only its venerable age, and a reminder that while the natives of the British Isles were still living in mud huts and engaged in little more than tribal warfare with pointed sticks, China was already a mature civilisation, with that almost inevitable, ironic mark of civilisation - a structured military. Some of the closing comments should perhaps shape modern military thinking more than the earlier ones, in that the suggestion towards the end is that a prime object of the art of war is to avoid conflict and death. Or is that the line that the military use to justify their existence in every age and culture?"
