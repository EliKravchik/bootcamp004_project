"1",0,"Jojo","I've read this book several times. It is one of the most readable pieces of great literature. The story is compelling on a very simplistic level, but the there are many layers to the novel. When I read this for the second time in college, I remember thinking, this story reminds me of the television series Columbo. The detective who plays dumb, the perpetrator of the crime who feels superior to the detective, etc. I thought I was so clever to make this leap between literature and popular culture. Much later I found out that Columbo was based on the novel. So much for great insight."

"3",2,"Evelyn H","When I first started reading this book, I was rather unimpressed. But as the story progresses, and the character's inner dialogue is further revealed, it was hard to put down. Overall and excellent investigation into the heart of humanity."
"4",3,"Leah","Amazing character development. You can see inside a person's mind and feel a normal man grow insane. Unsettling at first, as its supposed to be, but utterly amazing. One of the best books I have ever read. "

"6",5,"Burak","Crime and Punishment is one of my favorite classic ever! I am still not sure about why this one has impressed me so much. Most probably it is because Dostoyevski has really been aware of what human psychology is like, and he has the gift about how to voice it.I'm asking to the ones who has read this masterpiece, who has put himself in Raskolnikov's place, while reading? I bet everybody did! Why? Because you just don't read it, you feel the plot, story, place...everything. Dostoyevski is a great writer ever."

"8",7,"Jeff Bai","Crime and Punishment was recommended to my by many in the Mikkelson AP Literature class this year. Having felt strange for having read so much science non-fiction and science fiction, I decided to delve back into the literary mainstream. Here's what I thought of this work by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.Crime and Punishment was a unique novel, poignant in its timeliness and portrayal of 19th century Russia, but also oddly relatable to modern destitution and poverty. When considering the title of this work, we think logically about the natural transition from crime to punishment, the latter dealt out by law enforcement. However, for protagonist Rodion Raskolnikov, his crime stems from the fact that he believes himself to be capable of dealing with a murder mentally, and his punishment results when his conscience gnaws at him in the coming investigation.Often when reading books where the writer attempts to project his own ideals or vignettes of his own ideas onto the characters, the reader must understand the context and the background before being able to understand the subtle (or sometimes overt) meaning behind the characters' actions. However, with Crime and Punishment, Dostoyevsky is able to show his ideology and his thoughts without further investigation. For example, in Part II, Chapter I, Raskolnikov experiences ""something never before experienced"", that it was ""no longer possible to address [the] people in the police station"", reflects the isolation felt by Dostoyevsky himself during those years and how it could be a catalyst for things such as murder (2.1). For those who know that Dostoyevsky spent many years in exile in Siberia, this is definitely a prime example of his ideas coming out in the pages he wrote.In the epilogue, the sixth and final part of the book, Raskolnikov's love for a certain person is finally realized by that person. There was ""no doubt that he loved her infinitely, and that at last that moment had come"". This signifies redemption for the protagonist, and perhaps redemption for the author as well. The novel, published in 1866, was written only a few years after his time in Siberia. Perhaps, through this book, Dostoyevsky is simply putting on paper his thoughts, his dogma, his ideals.In the end, I found this to be an enjoyable book. Although I have reservations about the epilogue and whether it truly makes sense/is worthy when compared to the novel, I was glad to be able to digest and read into this classic. "

"10",9,"Michelle Smith","This book is a masterpiece. I found myself rooting for an ax murderer. Nearly as good as Anna Karenina (where I found myself cheering on the adulteress). Russians know how to write. That was a quick 950 pages."
"11",10,"Matthew Dunn","If you can swallow Russian literature, there is much wisdom waiting to be unearthed in this novel."
"12",11,"Vince","Time to give this another go. Having read it many years ago (high school?), I remember only the general outlines and the trouble I had keeping all the characters straight because they each had so many different names! This particular translation is highly regarded."
"13",12,"Joseph Devon","My reading of Crime and Punishment was the start of what I hope to be a revisiting of numerous Russian classics. I read all the big guns (barring War and Peace) many years ago and, quite frankly, got NOTHING out of them. I was confused, bored, confused, unable to wade through the thick writing, confused and, lastly, confused. I should probably address my confusion. I am, in real life as well as in art, an absolute clod at handling peoples' names. And it is common in the writing of many languages for characters to be referred to with various handles. In Russian you have the complete name, the last name, and the familiar name all interchanged willy nilly. So your main character will be Raskolnikov for the first ten pages and then suddenly someone named Rodya will be addressed. And you're supposed to know with zero instruction that this is Raskolnikov's nickname, or familiar address. Which is fine. I shorten Elizabeth to Liz or Thomas to Tom or Richard to Dick (though I've never understood that last one). But when it's a nickname for a giant name in a foreign language that I hadn't grasped much to begin with and has very little to do with the original name and there is zero hand-holding given...well I get lost. Combine three names per character with 12 or 13 main characters and for me it's a complete cluster-f**k of proper nouns that I have a hard time keeping straight. Ten years ago I was lost, now I managed to keep my head in the game and sort out what name referred to whom with, for me, shocking accuracy. I know that seems like a terribly superficial thing to dwell on, but nothing has effected my ability to enjoy Russian literature more than this. And I'm not saying it should change, again, this is standard fare for many languages, but man does it make for some rough going. Okay, that's out of the way, now onto the book. The book is awesome. Somehow I missed this ten years ago. It's a brilliantly gripping story of murder told mainly through the eyes of the murderer. Raskolnikov's madness and rambling thoughts are beautifully painted as well as his struggles during lucid moments to come to terms with what he actually believes. This struggle takes place amid tons of philosophical ramblings from all the characters. But the philosophies discussed were only barely overwritten (I generally have little patience for authors who let a character take ten pages to pontificate on their personal philosophy...a few sentences, sure, but I've never been out drinking and heard anyone talk for twenty minutes straight about the nature of man. It just doesn't happen and whenever I catch an author doing this it pulls me out of the story). The cast of characters were interesting, the numerous subplots of blackmail, coercion, love and desperate attempts to cling to the past were all fascinating. Not to mention you get a very interesting twist on the classic Who-Done-It here where...well you *know* ""Who Did It."" You watch him do it. And yet the book manages to keep the police investigation interesting and believable as well as cast just enough doubt on what on earth actually happened due to Raskolnikov's somewhat unreliable viewpoint. And then, after all of this, at the end, you are suddenly given just a stunningly beautiful affirmation of humanity and love that came so out of nowhere yet had a perfect foundation under it that I got chills up and down. I can't wait to read this again in ten years...maybe even less...depends on how long War and Peace takes me."
"14",13,"Keith Steinbaum","Crime and Punishment is a must-read. I first read it many years ago, but I still often go back to it when I don't have any books to read at the moment. One of the many things that I liked about this book is how the characters were molded. Each of them has their own philosophy in life, and I believe that's something that we all should learn from."
"15",14,"Tom Marcinko","I've read this novel four or five times, and IMO the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation is the one that rocks the hardest. If you're reading Dostoyevsky for the first time, this is the novel to start with, and this edition is worth springing for."
"16",15,"Bree","I feel I read this book at the improper time. I was forced to read it for a class over the summer in high school and did not enjoy it. I feel that if I were to re-read it today I would love it for the brilliant piece it is."
"17",16,"Noha","""But that is the beginning of a new story -- the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life. That might be the subject of a new story, but our present story is ended.""It took me a very, very long time to finish this book but it was definitely worth it! Full of misery, thoughts and tourments, the words and the conversations make you dive deep into this world of different consciousness.It's all about the struggle between what is right and what is wrong, what you believe in and what others believe in, the struggle to prove yourself right and the strength to face the chaos of your heart."
"18",17,"Noonidah","It took me some time to reclaim my breath reading Dostoyevsky, and probably lead me to develop a deep-seated, somewhat cynical contempt for nihilism, beside Camus. I'm not sure if I'd be able to figuratively read it twice, with both eyes open."
"19",18,"Shafiq Razak Rajan","Crime and Punishment is actually a satisfying crime thriller. I rarely enjoyed a novel until, when I finished the book, I felt like that my life's changed a bit. You can say that it's the same feeling after you finished watching the series finale of your favourite TV show, or after you had beaten the final boss of the best video game ever you ever played. The book isn't just a crime thriller (duh!). It actually contains observations and commentaries on the base nature of men, and of how radical subscription to an ideal might be as equally dangerous as having no ideals at all. It also contains Dostoyevsky's religious belief on how suffering is the only way to expiate one's sins. If you are not familiar with the Russian culture, it might be benificial if one could familiarise yourself on Russian honorifics. That might save you from being easily confused in keeping track of all the characters."
"20",19,"Susan Smith thom","Like Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky really understands human psychology. It is easy to identify with his characters' emotions, thoughts, and moods."
"21",20,"Pradeep T","Excellent!!A book must be read by everyone. It is simple, yet it feels quite heavy to digest initially. As it gets the pace and you get immersed in the story, then it sort of becomes an addiction and you don't want to put down this book. A classic rendition and a great way to tell the story. As simple as it sounds for the present generation, this story is way ahead of its time. Author Dostoyevsky has created a character that speaks like a great philosopher, yet, he is the most aloof person. The protagonist Raskolnikov and his journey towards the punishments for the crime he has committed is splendidly superb. The adjoining characters that sails with him through the story complimented really well. Razumihin, Dounia, the police characters, Svidrigailov, Sonia, the pawnbroker lady, etc... etc... are all well portrayed. A must read book."
"22",21,"Thomas","On my list as one of the best books i have EVER read.... Camus and Dostoyevsky are my two favorite authors, and this has to be considered when talking about Dostoyevsky's work. Very long, and not the easiest to read (of course, the same can be said for Tolstoy, Dickens, Austen, Victor Hugo or any of the other 19th Century novelists who get paid by the word), but well worth it... i did not find this novel as enjoyable as The Devils, or The Brothers Karamazov, but still fantastic."
"23",22,"David Mills","From my 1001 Books to Read Before you Die (Edited by Peter Boxall) reading list.Dostoyevsky's multifaceted characters and continually evolving plot lead the reader seamlessly through the dominant explanations of why we do what we do. The novel is a psychological, theological, philosophical, sociological, political & economic examination of human behavior that leads to the conclusion that we are at once simple and extremely complex creatures. Exhausting and awesome! "
"24",23,"Nelson Zagalo","Nada posso dizer de novo sobre “Crime e Castigo” (1886) de Dostoievski, é um clássico, como tal escrutinado em todas as demais dimensões que possamos imaginar. Contudo aproveitarei estas linhas para dar conta da minha experiência com o livro. Escrito no século XIX nada lhe falta se comparado com o género literário tão em voga neste nosso século, o thriller psicológico. Os personagens e os seus problemas desmontados como quem desmonta um relógio suíço, a constante introdução de novos problemas e as suas reviravoltas, a gestão minuciosa do suspense através do ritmo a que cada nova informação vai sendo revelada. É um livro escrito para nos prender, ainda que mesmo que o não fosse, nos manteria interessados pelo seu personagem e a sua busca existencial. Nesse sentido acaba sendo uma obra intemporal, já que o âmago da discussão se prende àquilo que faz de nós seres-humanos. “Crime e Castigo” é um relato do mundo realizado a partir do interior de uma alma amargurada. Dostoievski coloca-nos sob a pele de Raskólnikov, e faz-nos sentir o peso do ser, do outro, da sociedade. É um relato imensamente poderoso, que muito deve à experiência pessoal do autor. Em 1849 Dostoievski foi preso sob suspeita de conspiração contra Nicolau I da Rússia. Com ele foram detidos muitos outros, todos condenados à morte. No dia marcado para a execução, já estavam amarrados aos postes os primeiros quando chegou a ordem do Czar para comutar a pena por trabalhos forçados na Sibéria.“A mágoa e a inquietude sem saída de todo aquele tempo, sobretudo das últimas horas, tinham-no oprimido a um ponto tal que agora se precipitava, literalmente, para a esperança que lhe abria aquela sensação plena, nova, íntegra. A sensação acometeu-o como um ataque: acendeu-se-lhe na alma como uma faísca e, num sopro, incendiou-o todo. Tudo nele se abrandou de vez, jorraram-lhe as lágrimas. Caiu de joelhos…” Dostoievski, “Crime e Castigo” (1886)À medida que vou recuperando a leitura de clássicos, e seguindo obras enaltecidas, dou-me conta do quão relevante é o peso autobiográfico de uma obra. Como a experiência pessoal de sentires, vivências, lugares, pessoas, vidas, medos e alegrias é importante no criar de lastro de sustentação do relato de uma história interessante, crepitante, capaz de se dar a uma total degustação por outro ser humano. A obra imaginada, deslocada do fio de vida de quem a escreve, pode até ser um exercício interessante, mas dificilmente contém o detalhe necessário à reconstrução cristalina de um espaço-tempo capaz de ombrear com a obra que se recria a partir das experiências vividas de um autor.Isto explica, em parte, as razões pelas quais certos autores conseguem por vezes fazer uma obra, de rasgo genial, mas depois nunca mais voltam a atingir picos com a mesma intensidade. Aliás, isto vem de encontro à queixa do júri do prémio Nobel deste ano que referiu o facto de os escritores se acomodarem ao conforto da vida com bolsas, impossibilitando o surgimento de experiências de vida capazes de suportar novas ideias, novas abordagens, novos mundos. Mas isto não é uma queixa apenas deste júri, para quem vive no meio, e o gere enquanto editor, sabe que isso é uma realidade. Atente-se nas palavras de Bruno Vieira Amaral, autor de uma primeira-obra nacional de enorme sucesso junto da crítica em 2013, com vários prémios, e que em entrevista nos diz que não quer dedicar-se apenas à escrita, que irá continuar a dedicar-se a múltiplas outras coisas,""Não quero viver da escrita, isso é uma armadilha... obriga a uma desmultiplicação... Sei como o meio funciona... obriga a decisões que podem ser más a médio, longo prazo para o trabalho do escritor. Muita produção, com um ritmo que rouba a liberdade de dizer 'vou escrever quando me apetecer'."" (Bruno Vieira Amaral, in iOnline, 10.2013)Isto sente-se bastante quando começamos a ler (ou a ver no caso do cinema) a obra de certos autores, nomeadamente os contemporâneos, que pouco mais fizeram na vida para além de escrever. Ao fim de 3 ou 4 livros ficamos com a ideia que dizem sempre o mesmo, que nada mais dali se pode esperar retirar. Não admira que criativos mais conscientes desta vicissitude da criação artística, pensem em renegar a arte que os consagrou. A título de exemplo veja-se Bela Tarr, retirou-se em 2011 depois de 30 anos e 9 filmes, atente-se às suas palavras:“Ser cineasta é um belo trabalho burguês. Mas eu realmente não o quero fazer. Eu não sou um verdadeiro cineasta. Eu sempre estive nisto pelas pessoas, e só queria dizer algo sobre as suas vidas. Durante 34 anos de cinema, disse tudo aquilo que queria dizer. Eu posso repetir, posso fazer uma centena de coisas, mas na verdade não quero aborrecer-vos. Não quero copiar os meus filmes. É isto.” (Bela Tarr, in IndieWire, 02.2012)Num sentido completamente oposto, veja-se como António Lobo Antunes, com 24 romances publicados, se mantém ativo, e como se processa a escrita de cada nova obra sua. Como o processo mecânico e repetitivo toma conta da vontade expressiva, transformando o pessoal em maquinal.“Cada vez mais escrevo sem plano. Sento-me e fico à espera de começar a ouvir a voz. Tenho de fechar uma parte da cabeça para que a outra funcione. E a mão começa a andar sozinha... Este livro está pronto há muito tempo. Não sei, não me lembro. Só escrevi. Não me lembro de nenhum, mesmo deste que estou a escrever. Leio a última linha e continuo.” (António Lobo Antunes, in Estante, 10.2014) Para ver com imagens, formatação e links, ler em: http://virtual-illusion.blogspot.pt/2..."
"25",24,"Robert Morris","Perhaps the best book I have ever read. Intrigue on every page, vivid discriptions, characters jumping off the page, a true masterpiece of literature."
"26",25,"Xochitl","Doestoevsky's work is absolutely phenomenal. He follows the insanity of the main protagonist, Raskolinikov, and comments on human nature, politics, psychology, and society. He contrasts the opposing sides of Raskolnikov's nature through characters, Alena vs Lizaveta and Sonya vs. Svidrigaylov and the necessity of one to the other. Normally I like books with more action, but even this book filled with interesting characters and ideas and kept me hooked until the end."
"27",26,"Kevin Smith","You may have heard the popular saying about this novel, ""He commits the crime in the first pages and we are punished the rest of the novel"". Nothing could be further from the truth. A truly wonderful novel that delves into the human soul and psyche to unravel the dichotomy of good and evil. Intriguing and suspenseful.This novel does more, I believe, to address questions of Dostoevsky's own views on religion than his other novels. "
"28",27,"Paul","Intense, psychologically convincing, packed with ideas and great characters. I never expected it to be such a page-turner. One tiny quibble, the ending felt a bit rushed.A book I didn't want to end."
"29",28,"Bob Pearson","This is a timeless piece of writing, and it was done in personal agony. Haven't we all wondered - and toyed with - what it would mean to take a principle to its ultimate point? In a world of overwhelming imperfection, our protagonist decides that the only way to prove his commitment to his conviction is to act upon it - to murder. There are fascinating aspects to the book that perhaps Dostoyevsky himself would be shocked to see in the rearview mirror. In some odd but strangely prophetic sense, his dissection of one Russian soul and its fanatic dedication to a theory presages his country's leninist and stalinist future, that to achieve the perfection foreseen for communism, any number of innocent lives can be offered as payment. If Dostoyevsky wanted us to examine more deeply the meaning of punishment as well as crime, he could not have picked a better set of characters. A family is destroyed because an alcoholic cannot make his way out of the abyss. Officials wallowing in corruption and determined to exploit human weakness sail past judgment without a care. Those who commit crimes on the largest scale in the name of creating a greater good, e.g. Napoleon, (Stalin 75 years later) suffer or benefit not because of the morality of what they do but because of the success or failure of their attempt. Why should this not be true for a single person then, Dostoyevsky's hero Raskolnikov asks - himself and therefore us. One hundred and fifty years after it was written, this book and its questions will remain with you for a long time. "

I felt as though I was seeing it all through the main character's, Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, own eyes and I was there with him. It was written by a Russian author in the 1800s. The story centers around a young man, and what consequences certain decisions/actions of his lead to. There is so much more than that, but you will have to read it :) It is a full journey and I think it is a journey worth taking."

"35",34,"Ryan Hatch","9/10This is one of those books that I have a hard time defining why it's so good. I'll admit that there are times in the middle where my mind starts to wander, but the feeling that I'm left with at the end means a whole lot more. It's like Dostoyevsky has done such a good job of placing me in each moment of Raskolnikov's journey that I empathize and understand him, even as he's going to kill someone. Then the utter insanity and eventual guilt that follow. Ultimately it has much of the setting and feel of a Dickens novel, with much more darkness and soul searching. The end is so perfect. I want to say more but shouldn't. It's a story that ebbs and flows, but has many of the same themes as Count of Monte Cristo. It's hard to make such a flawed character into someone we want to root for."
"36",35,"Oksana Hagen","Great work, takes a bit of patience, but it is well rewarded!"
"37",36,"J.T. Wilson","Requiem for a Dream? Anthem for Doomed Youth? Either would work as an alternative title for a story in which protagonist Raskolnikov - fierce intellect over-stimulated and under-utilised - contrives and executes a plan to murder an unscrupulous pawnbroker as a sort of intellectual experiment, then starts to fall apart as his hypothesis collapses. It'd hardly be much of a stretch to film a version of this in austerity-era Britain: Rodion Romanovich can't afford his uni fees and is stuck in a slum while pawning his possessions, his excitable pal Razumikhin is semi-employed in a series of temp jobs, and his sister Dounia is making all the wrong career and romantic choices. The doomed Marmeladov family, meanwhile, inhibit the sort of tenement that might have the family from 'Shameless' as tenants, allowing for geography and time.Dostoevsky's prose matches the mental anguish of Raskolnikov with a frantic and anxious prose style: hardly a page goes by without someone screaming, shouting or frothing at the mouth. It's an exhausting read, made compelling by the protagonist and his chaotic interactions with a world that doesn't - cannot - get him. The extended Svidrigailov sequence is the only part that felt like a chore, particularly so close to the end, but the nightmare hysteria of the St Petersburg slums is a must-read."

"41",40,"Khalid Al Khalili","I would give this brilliant masterwork by Dostoevsky more stars if I could.This is the story of a man intensly divided in his mind, completely crushed by poverty and squalor, but possesses an intellectual caliber so lofty, it gives rise to pride and ego quite difficult to handle. (view spoiler)[ Set in the great city of St. Petersburg during pre-evolutionary 18th century Russia, and through an unusual combination of circumstances and ideals, Raskolnikov, our main protagonist, is incited to murder.In a belief which when closely examined might not seem so addled, he comes to the conclusion that humanity is divided into two segments, those with the ability to bring utilitarian good, and those without it. He argues that there exists an echelon of Napoleon-like men, who are allowed to transgress laws because in doing so, they bring about a desirable result for all. Also, in the success of their initiatives, old rules are demolished and new ones are set, allowing them to transcend punishment. The same concept follows the idea of revolutionaries who, in succeeding to overthrow standing government, punish other revolutionaries who try to oust them, even though it is the same process once used to achieve their own goals.Once the murder is committed, and perhaps even before so, Raskolnikov begins his journey of suffering, punishment, and for the least part, atonement. (hide spoiler)]I really don't know where to begin with the review of this novel. Every single aspect brought forth by Dostoevsky has a purpose and a meaning. The characters have such rich and colorful psychological profiles, the symbolic dreams of Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov, each dealing with issues brought on by their subconscious minds and leading them to action, the weak-mindedness of Katerina Ivanovna as she wastes away because of her intense suffering (not to mention consumption), the extreme smoothness of Porfiry Petrovich in his battle of wits with Raskolnikov, Marmeladov's story which sets the tone for the entire plot with a heartrending account of his family's troubles, brought on solely by himself. And Sonya, dear poor timid Sonya, forced to prostitute herself to support her family, consisting of her drunken, irresponsible and masochistic father (Marmeladov), her hysterical and delirious step-mother (Katerina Ivanovna), and her underfed, dirty step-siblings.There are also all sorts of themes, motifs, and symbols in the book, the color yellow for instance, associated with dirtiness and poverty, and later on symbolizing guilt and insanity. The crossing of bridges, as if crossing over into a different realm of mentality for Raskolnikov. Crossroads, and their implication of a turning point. Going to America, being associated with a place for the guilty to escape. Alienation from society, the crudeness of the typical Russian peasant, the psychology of crime and punishment, how a criminal in reality longs to be caught and punished because deep inside, he harbors guilt. Dostoevsky's unconventional nihilism makes its way and shows itself tremendously in the character of Raskolnikov, his utter disregard for social order and the emotions of others, as well as his dialogue with other characters in the book.This is the second book I've read for Dostoevsky, the first being The Brothers Karamazov and some people would insist on the superiority of the former to the latter, I've spent quite a bit of time considering this, and have decided that even though murder is a large part of both novels, such a comparison cannot be made. To start with, they are both of different genres, Crime and Punishment being a psychological drama, and The Brothers Karamazov being realist fiction, second the themes and motifs presented in each are completely different from each other, for Crime and Punishment it's the points I've mentioned above, while for Karamazov, it's the conflict of faith and doubt, moral responsibility and its possible roots in religion, as well as the burden of free will. The nature of the protagonists is completely different as well, Raskolnikov being a misanthrope, an outcast of society disliked by most people who chance to meet him, while Alyosha Karamazov is the closest embodiment of an angel on earth, pure in spirit and going about charming one person after another. They are simply different animals.A great pleasure indeed. If you're going to read this book, and I beg you to do so, please read the unabridged translation by Richard Pevear and his wife Larissa Volokhonsky. I urge you to check out The Brothers Karamazov as well, it is also well-worth your time."

"45",44,"Fraser McKenzie","Probably my favourite book of all time, the way Dostoyevsky is able to pull you in and take you on a downward spiral into madness is brilliant, I can't recommend this book enough."
"46",45,"Sally","Great themes wonderfully developed in this claustrophobic story. I was struck, however, by the protagonist deciding the girl deserved to be murdered as a freak of nature for being 5' 10"" (as I am), and that his old, old mother was in her early 40s."
"47",46,"Bojan Fürst","I always found this book exceptional for the multitude of voices that it is written in and the incredible atmosphere that just holds a reader captive. This translation is fantastic. "
"48",47,"Albin","I was laying on the couch in my parent's house reading this book one summer evening and I fell asleep. My mom came home and touched my shoulder, and whispered, ""Albin, wake up."" In the second it took to open my eyes, I had convinced myself that I killed two people but I could face my mom because they both deserved to die. This book will get in your head."
"49",48,"Irwin","It took me a while to read this, mainly because you have to give it your absolute full attention or risk missing something crucial. I picked it up in anticipation of a lengthy plane trip because I thought it had been too long since I read a really good book. Six weeks after the trip, I just finished it, and am now devastated to have to finally put it down after growing quite attached to it over those hours of reading. It fulfilled all my fantasies. It is beautifully written in a translation that very rarely reminds you that the original was written nearly 150 years ago. It is the ultimate crime/detective novel, exploring all the great themes and elaborated in a way that made me gasp out loud at regular intervals. The plot is intricate and full of unexpected twists and turns. The characters are extraordinary and end up linked to one another in amazing ways. It has been a great distraction from time otherwise spent watching the world end... "
"50",49,"John Watson"," I remember sitting in the woods smoking a cigar and sweating while I read this book during the summer before 11th grade. It was intense and I loved it. Definitely need to read it again sometime. "
"51",50,"Chiek Er","Brilliant Dostoyevsky took us on a psychological tour of the mind of a criminal before, during and after the double murders were committed. Dostoyevsky explored the circumstances that push a person to cross the line. Abject poverty? Unrealistic expectation? Societal and family pressure? Delusions of grandeur? Whatever the reasons, these ciminals that do succumb to temptations or pressure and crossed the line, some like Raskolnicov would find because God provided them with interventions from angels like Sonja. With the immense and patient self sacrifical love from the down trodden but virtuos, Sonja, Dostoyevsky soul was turned and lead to a place where there was light, warmth and redemption. "
"52",51,"Stephanie","Ok, this one took about 150 pages to really get into, mostly because it was difficult to follow the switching of names due to the translation. After that point not only did the story really pick up, but I felt I could really follow the story smoothly. This one is definitely a fantastic story by a great author. It just requires a real time and concentration commitment."
"53",52,"Keirstan","Now this is where you start with Dostoevsky! I may have erred on the side of anticipation in first reading THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV, but CRIME AND PUNISHMENT is really where I'd recommend one to start with the Russian Master. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT is fantastic for a slew of reasons, not the least of which is its compulsive readability. I don't mean at all to say that the translation was trite (and it isn't--Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky are renowned for their true-to-form Dostoevsky translations) or the concepts simplistic, this is just a case of one experiencing intrigue with a book of great ideas and insights.The premise of the book is nothing less than the examination of what drives and shapes an intellectual murderer. Dostoevsky begins his ""novel in six parts with epilogue"" with an examination of the killer's state of mind before the criminal act. The reader meets Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov one day before the act occurs and examines his motivations. We first learn that he harbors a self-centered opinion of the world around him. In nearly every interaction he believes himself to be the motivation. An example of this occurs early on when Raskolnikov reads a letter from his mother and deigns that both her decisions as well as his sister, Dunya's, are motivated by the desire to bolster his well being. A second aspect of Raskolnikov, and probably the most notable, is his inability to connect with others. Raskolnikov craves a connection with humanity but always finds himself at an arm's length, never fully capable of true companionship. The greatest driving force behind this disconnect is Raskolnikov's belief that he is an intellectual rung above the masses. In most interactions Raskolnikov is forced to reckon with what he believes is the fact that he has a greater capacity to understand the world than his fellow man. As a result, he is never fully able to connect.The first part of the novel concludes with the consummation of Raskolnikov's crime: the murders of Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta. It is slowly revealed, primarily through a published article entitled ""On Crime,"" that Raskolnikov's world view consists of the notion that there exists two types of people in the world: the ordinary and the extraordinary. The ordinary people, according to Raskolnikov, exist merely to procreate and abide by the rules the extraordinary set. The extraordinary people do just that, interpret the world and set the rules and regulations by which the rest of the population live. As a result, Raskolnikov determines that the extraordinary set is thereby ""exempt"" from the laws of society for the sake of their world changing ideas. Desperately, Raskolnikov envisions himself a member of this latter set. In order to effectuate his notion, he decides to kill Alyona Ivanovna, an old ""crone"" who is essentially a shyster pawnbroker, in order to rob her. As a result, Raskolnikov believes that he will be eliminating a louse in order to benefit others. Terminologically speaking, he wishes to accomplish an act of utilitarianism, his great contribution to the world.As the novel progresses, however, Raskolnikov comes to the realization that he may not be a member of his purported ""extraordinary set."" Instead of feeling bolstered with purpose, Raskolnikov is burdened with paranoia and suppressed with guilt after the murders take place. He not only tortures himself with his guilt, but at the same time plays a tormented game of cat-and-mouse with the police investigator, Porfiry Petrovich, who sees through his psychosis early on. Ultimately, and through Dostoevsky's great skill for suspenseful writing, Raskolnikov's works himself toward his ultimate confession of the crime.Motivating Raskolnikov's confession and assumed redemption is Sonya, the daughter of the peripheral but pivotal character Marmelodiov, a girl who has sacrificed herself to a life of prostitution in order to support her family. Sonya is motivated by her religion and love for her fellow human being: notably Raskolnikov. Through the companionship she demonstrates throughout the novel and epilogue Raskolnikov is able to come to terms with his need for human comraderie and submits to his love for Sonya. His ultimate submission gives the reader hope that Raskolnikov not only feels actual remorse for his crime, but will actually atone for it as well.Raskolnikov's story is wrought with insight into the human condition, which is in fact, the decisive lure of this book. Dostoevsky has such an excellent grasp of what motivates a person to do the unthinkable act of murder that the reader cannot help but be intrigued. The text is ample with characters that each act according to the code that the human condition requires, rendering the text originally published in Russian in 1866 timeless and universal. For anyone interested in deepening his/her understanding of the human condition I would certainly recommend beginning withCRIME AND PUNISHMENT ."
"54",53,"aPriL does feral sometimes","Utter genius. I understand poverty. I understand the anxiety of being a powerless female in a patriarchal society. I understand the agonies of having a male family member who is mentally ill, yet he is nominally in charge of the family and finances, and how, as a woman, one can only, desperately, hang onto his coat tails in a feeble attempt to hold back the wild insane tantrums which are devastating whatever future the family may have had. I have, however, no sympathy for such a cruel mind as the main protagonist in this famous book, Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, (whose name means “a schism, or split; ""raskolnik"" is ""one who splits"" or ""dissenter""; the verb raskalyvat' means ""to cleave"", ""to chop"",""to crack"",""to split"" or ""to break"". The former translations clarify the literal meaning of the word. The figurative meaning of the word is ""to bring to light"", ""to make to confess or acknowledge the truth"", etc.” per Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_an...).Raskolnikov murders in a dreadful manner (using an ax) an old tough woman who earns her living as a pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, and her sweet-natured sister, Lizaveta, who walked into her sister’s apartment unexpectedly during the chaotic and stupid murder. Raskolnikov thinks the pawnbroker is disgusting, evil, but she struck me as an entrepreneur earning her living as competently as she knew. It is obvious the author is also aware of the innocence of the murder victims, but I wonder at the psychological intensity and authentic exploration of Raskolnikov’s twisted intelligence and spiteful hatred. How does Fyodor Dostoevsky appear to be so intimately educated about such a mind? But of course, I wonder at how the author is also spot-on psychologically with every one of his characters in the novel. He is an incredibly astute creator of the internal mechanics of all of his characters, and by the end of the book, everyone, not only the god wannabe Raskolnikov, is as known to the reader as much as real family members.The book is about the whack-job Raskolnikov and his extremely impoverished 19th century St. Petersburg environment, friends, family and acquaintances. Wherever he goes, we readers follow, with a few digressions into the minds and activities of people he meets and knows. The character I most identified with was ‘Dunya' Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikov, Raskolnikov’s sister, but most of my sympathy was with ‘Sonya’ Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov, who was forced into prostitution as a teen to support her family. I am also a fan of Dmitri Prokofych Razumikhin, student friend of Raskolnikov, a gentle intelligent man of feelings who helps modestly when he is able. If Raskolnikov hadn’t been such a despicable pig, the character I would have most hated is the alcoholic Semyon Zakarovich Marmeladov, Sonya’s stepfather. Sonya’s poor mother, Katerina Ivanovna Marmeladov, dying of consumption, with small children to raise, also had my heart in a painful grip of sympathy. Though the despair and madness of her illness caused her to behave harshly, she was very understandably grasping at what little dignity and hope she could muster under the most desperate of circumstances. She convinced Sonya to become a prostitute, getting a ‘yellow card’ from the authorities because it is the only way for the family to buy food and shelter. Even so, Marmeladov, the drunk, steals what little money Katerina is able to hide and goes out to drink up every kopek, leaving his wife and babies to starve for days. He is not a complete monster, as none of the characters are. Unlike today’s novels, especially genre thrillers and mysteries, these and all other characters in the novel are full-fleshed and three-dimensional, not sketched out with broad strokes immediately recognizable from our familiarity with this century’s stock actors (not that there is anything wrong with that!).The most shocking character is Nikolai Dementiev, a painter who was working in an apartment downstairs from the murder victims. He IS a revelation! Nikolai confesses to the murder despite having nothing to do with the killings except for being in the area and a suspect for a time. What I found amazing is such false confessions occurred for crimes in the 19th century and these people were well known to police in Russia, as they are to the Western world today.Human nature does not change, however disgusting, heroic, ordinary or desperate a person’s responses may be. The characters Dostoevsky writes about are all easily recognizable to me even though they are Russian and lived more than a hundred years in the past during the czar Alexander III’s reign. As difficult as reading this densely populated and lengthy examination of the individuals living in an urban Russian neighborhood (with the exception of serfs and aristocrats, who are the only groups of people missing from the story) can be, I thought it as rewarding and illuminating to read as watching relatives and co-workers or being married for a long time. Grinding poverty clearly is the motivating factor behind every character’s decisions, which the author thoughtfully examines and explores with all of the intelligence that literary genius writers of classics are capable. Romantic solutions are offered, but in no way is this a romantic book. People live up to their expectations, which is the tragedy and the beauty of being human. Dostoevsky captures the entire array of the possibilities humans think to absolve or involve themselves in schemes, ideas and actions, seeking ways to maneuver around, with and for people and yet financially support themselves with minimal loss of self-respect or harm to others - except Raskolnikov.Raskolnikov believes in a theory he developed on his own, using elements from history, psychology and philosophy. He is a great admirer of Napoleon ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon), and believes himself to be like his hero, or in fact, his deluded ideas about his hero, whom he thinks was a great man because he willfully and with historical purpose ignored the laws and mores of society. The theory he develops, which the murder of the pawnbroker he hoped would demonstrate, is that some men, supermen, actually, do not have normal emotions or needs. Instead, being smarter and emotionally stronger than the average citizen, they have a responsibility to history and society to take upon themselves the powers of life and death beyond sentiment, morality or law. In murdering Alyona Ivanovna, symbol of an abuser of necessity and need, he is testing his imagined likeness to his hero, Napoleon, and he hopes to wake the sleeping lion king within, moving on to further successes and leadership of men lesser than himself.These ideas are not unfamiliar - Nietzsche (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedric...) apparently began writing about his ideas in 1870; but the reader should be reminded ‘Crime and Punishment’ was written in 1866, before some well-known philosophers and nations actually tried on portions of these ideas for governance and genocide with the resultant horrific outcomes with which we are familiar. Most remarkable to me are the odd coincidences and similarities between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky’s life, and even more weird, plot: “On 3 January 1889, Nietzsche suffered a mental collapse. Two policemen approached him after he caused a public disturbance in the streets of Turin. What happened remains unknown, but an often-repeated tale from shortly after his death states that Nietzsche witnessed the flogging of a horse at the other end of the Piazza Carlo Alberto, ran to the horse, threw his arms up around its neck to protect it, and then collapsed to the ground.” A nightmare Raskolnikov has in the book is very much the same.The link below is the best short analysis in my opinion, and it accurately describes exactly what the book seemed to be about to me:http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/crime/c...(view spoiler)[This section is one I completely agree with, and I cannot say it better:NihilismNihilism was a philosophical position developed in Russia in the 1850s and 1860s, known for “negating more,” in the words of Lebezyatnikov. It rejected family and societal bonds and emotional and aesthetic concerns in favor of a strict materialism, or the idea that there is no “mind” or “soul” outside of the physical world. Linked to nihilism is utilitarianism, or the idea that moral decisions should be based on the rule of the greatest happiness for the largest number of people. Raskolnikov originally justifies the murder of Alyona on utilitarian grounds, claiming that a “louse” has been removed from society. Whether or not the murder is actually a utilitarian act, Raskolnikov is certainly a nihilist; completely unsentimental for most of the novel, he cares nothing about the emotions of others. Similarly, he utterly disregards social conventions that run counter to the austere interactions that he desires with the world. However, at the end of the novel, as Raskolnikov discovers love, he throws off his nihilism. Through this action, the novel condemns nihilism as empty.”from Spark Notes. Naturally, Raskolnikov discovers his untested supposition about the likeness to Napoleon he believes himself to be leads him down dark alleys of conscience he never knew existed in his soul once he commits murder. However, when he realizes that the nervous anxieties, which he also was aware existed within himself, are not sated or satisfied by being able to kill, he feels great gusts of disgust and self-hatred, believing himself to be a failure because of his apparent bourgeois mediocrity, rather than from any sense of remorse. (hide spoiler)]I did not see a single thing to admire or love about Raskolnikov. His neurotic insanities are not excused by poverty, starvation or any horror of the society he lives in. His innermost desire is to transcend poverty and ignorance through enhancing psychopathic tendencies, instead of nurturing and helping the weak. His way is not self-sacrifice, as Sonya does, or practical informed morality as Dunia symbolizes, or hopeful anxiety as his mother uses to maneuver. He isn’t s sensualist as Svidrigailov shows himself to be, or a solid ‘mediocrity’ as he would define his friend Razumikhin to be. Raskolnikov’s madness is not that of Katerina’s, brought on by physical disease, or even that of Marmeladov, helpless alcoholic. He has no desire to be of assistance to humanity or for excitements of the chase, as the police. Instead, he poisons himself with theory and arid intellectual ideas, emphasizing alienation from and superiority over the common man. (view spoiler)[ Hopefully, Sonya will be able to bring out the other side of his nature which he has worked so horribly to suppress. She follows him to Siberia after he is sentenced to prison for 8 years, and with a great deal of love and perseverance, as well as acceptance of her lot and choices, she seems to break through to the Raskolnikov who, before he decided on the attempt to become another Napoleon (as he perceived Napoleon the celebrity to be), he begins to thaw, possibly, into regret, sorrow and love. He had shown a kinder, gentler self in several heroic acts of bravery and generosity of spirit previous to isolating himself from his family and friends. So, gentle reader, I can say the book ends on a hopeful tone?!? Maybe.  (hide spoiler)]This is a great read. I loved it. It is the real ‘masterpiece’ kind of literary writing that I think writers, such as Mauve Binchy, for example, dimly echo in their simple character-driven stories. (Yes, laugh at me if you must, but to me it was as if this book was the Plato ‘allegory of the cave’ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory... original ‘reality form’ that Binchy’s books kinda copy in a dumbed down fashion. I can’t help it, but that is what my mind kept leaping to as I read. I know, I’m an idiot; but did I ever say I wasn’t? I never promised I am a towering intellect like the authors I presume to review. The world is indeed a peculiar place, but do not fear. I have no pretensions of being a Napoleon of the review!)"

"59",58,"Gerhard Kleynhans","Love conquers all, in this most extraordinary of love stories.Young law student, Raskolnikov, deeply affected by the suffering of humanity to which he 'bows down', formulates an ethical view that gives 'extraordinary' people with the capacity for saying something new, the right to commit breaches of morality and crimes for the benefit of humanity.An unlikely criminal, Raskolnikov assumes this right for himself and murders an old woman whom he regards as 'a louse, a useless, loathsome, harmful creature' with the aim to use the money stolen to improve his position in life for the benefit of humanity. Unplanned, her timid and idiotic younger sister is also murdered when she encounters him red-handed on the murder scene.Following the double homicide, Raskolnikov descends into a hell of anguish. His terrible suffering seeks relief by admission, but he fears the consequences. The frightening trajectory of his conscience to finding relief plays out in a thrilling intrigue of Raskolnikov's interaction with those he loves and those he hates. A manic storytelling style, sometimes verging on the incoherent, is brilliantly used by Dostoevsky to evoke in the reader the dark and frightening anguish experienced by Raskolnikov.Desparate for relief, Raskolnikov admits his terrible crime to Sonia, a kind, gentle and loving Christian girl, humiliated into prostitution by life-wrenching poverty. Raskolnikov tries but fails to provide a reasonable justification of his crime to Sonia, but with infinite love she offers to suffer with him and together with him to bear their cross.Sonia's love empowers Raskolnikov with the courage to also admit his crime to the authorities and face the consequences. Ultimately, at first hand, Raskolnikov receives and is revitalised by the love of the cross.The most extraordinary of love stories, based on the archetype of Christian love."

But, I am awed by it, by the way it has been written, by the characters, by the descriptions, by the utter simplicity of language and yet, its density. I have not read enough of Dostoyevsky to give a detailed review, but this book, is a story, really. This book makes you think- and not only about deep stuff; just think about things we all have thought about sometime or the other and never shared with anyone. This man, hoewever, wrote characters who he exposed( or tried to) with a surgical precision which is scary. It took me a long time to read it. At times, I just put it down, too frustrated by the density of description and its length. But never did I think about discontinuing reading.Reading this book began as a challenge to self; it soon became an inevitability.I think there is a particular time to read certain books- I am glad I picked this one at the right moment.

I mean, the story was overall brilliant; especially the beginning when it was only about Raszkolnyikov was the best. Though then I didn't really understand him and what the author would like to express with his character. Then later when all those side characters came to the plot the whole story felt a bit out of place, however not a singular word was wasted on excess details. The mood in the beginning returned in the end when Rogya went back to the police station or whatever for the second time and confessed everything. And in the epilogue the ending was really the happiest this story could bear and it was also relieving. By the way I'm pretty much sure Death Note got the inspiration from this book."

I could get lost in his misery any day of the week. I am equally drawn to the tempestuous, minor chords of Rachmaninoff's concertos or the twisted wreckage of Klimpt's ornamented nudes, so perhaps it's no surprise that I would be comfortable in the gray mire of Dostoevsky's moral and philosophical musings. Because I really eat it up.I loved this book. I don't even know if love is something one is supposed to feel for such a book. But I did. Can't say which I loved more, this or Karamazov.

El hecho de que muchas personas tengan bajos recursos económicos, las puede impulsar a cometer actos “desesperados” que pueden haber sido realizados de manera consciente o inconsciente, pero que a final de cuentas tiene un efecto negativo en los demás. Además de que encontramos un claro ejemplo de que muchas veces las personas que tienen de cierta forma algún “poder” (ya sea económico o de cualquier otro tipo) utilizan esto a su favor y se aprovechan de las necesidades de los que no tienen nada. Por último creo que la culpa que Raskolnikov es un ejemplo de: “El fin no justifica los medios” ya que no importa que tan mal se haya sentido después de haber llevado a cabo los asesinatos, lo hecho, hecho estaba y tenía que cumplir un castigo por los actos que realizo.

Raskolnikov, the protagonist, is a victim of society in many ways. Although he is of above average intelligence, he is poor, without employment, and has left university. It is perhaps his intellect allows him to fantasize over the act of murder without any moral or legal consequences. Raskolnikov entertains the idea that some men are able to kill others without consequence for the greater advancement of society – this theory being largely based on Napoleon, who was remembered for his incredible feats and not the people he slayed. It is with this theory in mind Raskolnikov murders an old pawnbroker and her sister in their apartment. Thereafter he is terrified that his guilt will betray him to his friends and the authorities. This terror is widely observed by Raskonlikov’s friends, family and the inscrutable police inspector Porfiry which thrusts Raskolnikov into a dangerous game of wits. It is truly a magnificent story of depravity, psychology, and redemption. "
"78",77,"Alexandra Vasiac","My all-time favourite book. I read it many years ago and still is my first peek when I am asked which book is my favourite. The way Dostoyesvsky surprises all the psychological fights of Raskolnikov, his demons which torment him up to the point that he goes mad and gives him his so searched soul peace only at the point that you don't think is possible to find it anymore...this is a masterpiece about men and life"
"79",78,"Christina","While I would never have liked this book as a pleasure read, I found that I was enamored with it as a close read--a book I had to study, analyze, and report on. It drew me in with its fantastic diction and the vivid nature of the world Dostoyevsky creates. I will always consider this book one of my favorites. "
"80",79,"Sara Peg","I read this once a year and every time it hits me differently, but always amazingly. An incredible work that makes you fall in love with the main character for the same reasons you should despise him. Everyone in the world should read this book, for it exposes motives for actions, good and evil at conflict in one being, the ideas of self-destruction through being overly conscious of one's self and the world that one lives in, and the idea of salvation through both selfish and self-submissive actions and thoughts. Read it and your life will never be the same again. Seriously."
"81",80,"Nandan","It was a rewarding experience to read this book. I am sure my meager review is not going to do any justice to it, so I won't pretend to write about how Dostoevsky reaches into unlit recesses (dark has a negative tinge to it) of human mind and how masterfully he has constructed a great novel out of a story which otherwise could have been just a melodrama. Instead I would just mention my reading experience. Normally it is tough for me to concentrate and read anything over 15-20 pages at a stretch at a noisy place; but I read this book's fifth part in one sitting in a crowded cafe. To say that the poignant tale of Raskolnikov and Katerina Ivanovna is gripping would be a gross understatement. It might sound strange, but it almost affects you physically. Very few passages from any other book that I've read so far would rival its effect.I wanted to read through to sixth (last) part; but was simply too overwhelmed to continue. May be it was due to the dark and gloomy December evening outside combined with the purest melancholy that Dostoevsky can summon in his words or the fact that I've seen someone suffer through the same psychological symptoms as that of Katerina Ivanovna or the combination of the two. It is hard to say. It is hard to describe the anguish that transcends your petty personal sorrows and troubles. Perhaps only a melancholy raaga played on a Violin or Lata's masterly sad songs of the '50s would come close. Such experiences are rare. I can only be grateful."
"82",81,"Claude Nougat","A super classic! Nobody, but nobody has ever managed a deeper psychological thriller. I read that a long time ago, in my 20s, and I still remember as if I had read it yesterday..."
"83",82,"Atilim Tosun ","Ben. Bu kitabın sonunda ağlamakli olduysam, sizin ne gibi duygular yasayabileceginizi hayal edemiyorum.."
"84",83,"Colie!","This has to be one of my favorite ""classics""... after suffering from War and Peace, to discover that I could ravish every moment of a famous Russian novel was really a glorious thing. And this is glory in novel form. I love, love love it. LOVE it. I would go to the gym in Moscow, sit on the reclining bike and read for a straight hour of cardio and never had enough. Awesome. So, if you haven't read any Russian lit and you're choosing between Tolstoy and them other bitchez, THIS IS THE WAY TO GO. (I haven't read much others yet. I'm sure they're good too. But this one rocks my casbah.)"
"85",84,"Sharon Li","A beautifully translated classic. Dostoevsky is brilliant in his depiction of the inner psyche of a desperate ""criminal"". His deft prose enables the reader to live the mind of the protagonist. I broke into a cold sweat when Raskolnikov was in a tense situation; adrenalin pours through my own veins when he is caught up with the police. This book should be studied by anyone who is into criminal law or psychology."
"86",85,"Rachi","Este libro me encantó en toda la extensión de la palabra. Lo amé, amé la trama y sobretodo el desarrollo psicológico de Raskolnikov, un personaje del que me enamoré sin saber muy bien porqué. Me encantaba que fuera una mente tan perdida y que sin embargo pudiera sentir compasión o amor. Me encantaba el amor incondicional que le demostraba a Sonia, o a su hermana. Me encantó la forma en que Dostoyevsky demuestra la sociedad y los crímenes y el castigo en sí. A mi manera de ver, demuestra más cómo es que la persona que comete el crimen se castiga a sí mismo y no cómo la sociedad lo castiga. Me encantó. "
"87",86,"Renee Mercedes","Favorite book of all time, i own like 10 copies of it and have read it at least 20 times. "

"89",88,"Aymen","« Dostoïevski est la seule personne qui m'ait appris quelque chose en psychologie. » (Friedrich Nietzsche)Friedrich Nietzsche called Dostoyevsky ""the only psychologist ... from whom I had something to learn; he ranks among the most beautiful strokes of fortune in my life"".Hermann cautioned that to read him is like a ""glimpse into the havoc"".The Norwegian novelist Knut Hamsun wrote that ""no one has analysed the complicated human structure as Dostoyevsky. His psychologic sense is overwhelming and visionary."""
"90",89,"António Simões","Grande livro, escrita intensa, cheia de pormenores que conseguem levar-nos às cenas do romance. A personagem Raskolnikov e Sonia são fantásticas. É um livro obrigatório na biblioteca e na nossa mente."
"91",90,"Yognik Baghel","""It's pronounced as Dosto-v-fesky"". Now, one of those works on psychology, which makes you, many a times while reading, suddenly close the book to grasp the depth and relevance of what you just read and say out loud 'O Fuck! This is sacred!'. The book deals with criminal psychology and what goes behind a criminal mind. For those who don't already know this also is a masterpiece of existentialism, infact one of the first works on the theme. The element of absurd appears many a times and is pretty palpable by the book ends. No doubt Camus and Sartre received their motivation from this work. Nietzsche also praised the book for it's psychological element. I guess that marks the final test of quality that this masterpiece proudly owes to its readers. So go ahead purchase your copy and read this great work by Dosoyevsky. "
"92",91,"Ophelia Beyle","Excellently constructed psychological tale about a man who deems himself above any kinds of crime and punishment, and the consequences of such dangerous thoughts in a society unable to detach itself from convention. Definitely not a light read, but a worthwile one."

"97",96,"Sara","I fully admit to not liking this book at all for about the first third. We have a loathsome protagonist, not because he is a murderer, but because he spends so much time whining, desperately wondering whether or not he's important. It's like every boy we ever dated, or thought about dating, in high school. But, the brilliance of the book shines through anyway, through each character attempting to cobble together some, sometimes delusional, sense of being something. It's his secondary characters that won me over (especially poor Katerina Ivanovna) and which document Dostoyevsky's singular talent of psychological portrait. I still prefer the Idiot, and also the Brothers K, but this is an excellent book."
"98",97,"Ralph","It takes a lot of effort, but it's worth it."
"99",98,"Jerry","Dostoyevsky's legendary book was all it was cracked up to be. Suspenseful, engaging, and thought-provoking, I felt Rodion's quest from his early crime to his eventual acknowledgement of its punishment (apt title, this one) to its conclusion to be extraordinarily well-written and beautifully told through Constance Garrett's translation. Dostoyevsky had a way of describing facial movements with incredible skill. As the characters displayed their emotions, the details given were crystal clear and easy to visualize. That aspect alone made this a wonderful book, not to mention its excellent narrative! The edition I read also had masterful woodcuts by one of my favorite illustrators, Fritz Eichenberg. Together, Dostoyevsky, Garrett and Eichenberg united to make this one wonderful read."
"100",99,"Alex Bigney","i remember being 16 and reading this book in one long session. i didn't sleep that night, but lay awake unable to stop reading. it will always remain my measure of a novel. my only regret is that i had to read a translation. more of this stuff would fix our public schools and a rising generation of kids who think that reading has to do with the terse communication and screen of a cell phone. (my apologies to those younger people who do actually read books deeper than harry potter--and at least, thank heaven, there is harry potter!) "
"101",100,"Brian","There isn't much wrong with this book. This is probably one of the best novels ever written. The villain is the main character, but he other than the crime he committs he is a normal man that we can all relate to. The journey on which his guilt takes him has tragic consequences for more than just the main character. A MUST read."
"102",101,"Liv","I had to read this book for a university class a couple years ago, and I've rarely felt so pleased to be forced to read a book. Before I read it, someone who had already read some of Dostoyevsky's works suggested that I should read it while in a ""19th century Russian state of mind"" - which I tried - and I really enjoyed the book, in fact, I seem to recall that I found certain parts of it funny.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in human nature, and why people do the things they do."
"103",102,"Özge İnci","''Acı ve üzüntü, engin bir bilinç ve derin bir yürek için her zaman zorunludur. [...] Bence gerçekten büyük insanlar, büyük acılar çekmek zorundadırlar.'' Onlarca altı çizili satır arasından bence bu şaheseri en iyi özetleyen cümle bu olduğu için bu cümleyi alıntıladım. Suç'un ve dolayısıyla kötü'nün ne olduğu ve ne olmadığı diyalektiği üzerine temellenmiş bir edebiyat-sanat eseri, belki de yeryüzünde insan elinden çıkabilecek, yazılmış ve yazılabilecek en iyi roman. Şu sıralar yoğun bir şekilde klasikleri okuyan biri olarak klasikleri klasik yapan şeyi bulmaya çalışıyor ama yine de somut argümanlar sunamıyorum kendime. Ama bu kitap en başından en sonuna, her bir karakterinin kişiliğinin ince bir dantel gibi işlenişi ve yansıtılmasıyla, sanki bir gerilim filmi izliyormuşçasına gerçekçi tasvirleri ile bana sadece klasikleri klasik yapan şeyi açıklamakla kalmadı, bir başyapıtın ne olduğunun kanlı canlı örneği olarak çıktı karşıma ve öylece benliğime işledi. Hayır kolay değildi okumak, çoğu okurun bir kitaptan beklediği o akıcılık bunda yoktu. Aksine ağırdı, sadece özveriyle, anlayarak, acıyla, yaşayarak okuyanlara teslim ediyordu kendisini ve kimbilir belki de o kadar yaşayarak okumaya çalışsam da benim de ıskaladığım noktalar, ince detayla vardı ve bunu düşünmek bile içimde bir burukluk yaratıyor şimdi. Karakterleri, tasvirleri, kendine has üslubu, psikolojik tahlilleri, sadece toplumsal sorunları değil, varoluş sorunlarını irdeleyen, çarpan, bölen ama net bir sonuca da ulaştırmayan ve bu yönüyle sadece kurgusal olarak zirvede olan bir edebiyat ürünü değil aynı zamanda bir felsefe kitabı Suç ve Ceza. Edebiyatı, sanatı, felsefeyi, psikolojiyi, sosyolojiyi bu kadar iyi harmanlayabildiği için de bir başyapıttır.Son olarak, şimdiye kadar okumadığım için utansam ve hayıflansam da bir yandan da şuanda hissettirdikleriyle iyi ki şimdi okumuşum hissini yaşatıyor. ne yazmalı başka bilemiyorum, tüm muhteşem sanat eserleri de kelimeleri kifayetsiz bırakmaz mı zaten?

"104",103,"Bruno","Um homem pode escapar de tudo e de todos, pode enganar a quantos deseje, mas nunca poderá fugir da sua própria consciência, na hora que perde-se em devaneios ficará perturbado pelos seus próprios demônios, diria que Rodia tinha 3 opções: Se matar, Se entregar ou ainda, enlouquecer o que terminaria por ser uma morte da consciência. Somente um psicopata consegue se safar disso, para pessoas normais tal coisa seria impossível. Tremendo livro!!Quando Porfírio (Juiz de Instrução) falou a nosso Rodia que ele era como uma borboleta que rodopiava no fogo crepitante e que Porfírio seria o fogo e que por experiência própria ele bem o sabe que as borboletas sempre vão de encontro ao fogo e terminam chamuscadas.Também compreendi como o amor é capaz de ressuscitar um homem morto da sua consciência. Da ideia nefasta ao crime tremendo, o amor ressuscita o pior dos homens. "
"105",104,"Lis","Increíble como Dostoyevsky ha conseguido sumergirme en este libro. Es como si viera con mis propios ojos cada suceso, como si yo misma hiciera esas reflexiones, tuviera esas inquietudes, esos miedos y esas seguridades. Los personajes son muy completos y están muy bien tratados psicológicamente; los escenarios, perfectamente descritos. Un halo de oscuridad rodea toda la historia. Es complicado explicar cómo ha hecho que me sienta este libro, y eso me gusta. El final me ha dejado buen sabor de boca, aunque mucha curiosidad."
"106",105,"Liz","The second ""classic lit"" book to really drag me in and not let me go til it was finished. I lived within this book for several days, feeling quite paranoid and completly unable to escape its world when I emerged for meals or school. What an amazing book! I must compare translations."
"107",106,"Simpet Soge","Buku ini hanya ada satu di perpust SMA saya dulu. Makanya tidak bisa dipinjam n juga tidak bisa dibaca sekaligus sampai selesai. Tetapi saya akhirnya dapat menyelesaikan membaca cerita ini semasa kuliah. Ceritanya tentang seorang mahasiswa rantau di St. Petersburg yang membunuh wanita tua. Di sana terdapat pemikiran yang rada filosofis tentang bagaimana si pelaku boleh membunuh si wanita tua karena si wanita tua adalah lintah darat. Apakah ia diperbolehkan membunuh? Bagaimana ia dikejar-kejar perasaan bersalah, dan kemudian menyerahkan diri kepada tangan hukum? Menarik!"
"108",107,"Mary Westover","I consider this a personal triumph to finally have conquered this novel! This is a disturbing and provocative look into the mind of a killer, primarily because it makes the act seem so possible. A psychological thriller that's definitely worth the effort!"
"109",108,"Nadia Torok","An absolutely amazing book comparable to ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" in its thoughtful and haunting examination of the human conscience. This book became my friend as I read it, and I'll miss it until the next time. "
"110",109,"Dell","So I'm embarrassed that it took me so long to get around to reading this book. It was fantastic. There were so many surprises throughout. Humor, intrigue, insanity, and brutal crime--as I told my sister quite glibly after finishing it yesterday afternoon: it was Law & Order: St. Petersburg. I think I heard the ""buh-buh"" at the beginning! :-)"
"111",110,"Tarrastarr","i read this when i was just out of college. dostoevskys unpretentious philosophical outlooks are almost accidental in his telling of this and other tales as well. a very well deserved classic label on this one for sure. although conversations can seem to go on for days and days, in the long run raskalnikov and dostoevskys tale sticks with you for a long time."
"112",111,"Felicity","I'm always reluctant to tackle ""great books"" because I think they'll be too heavy to really enjoy. But I'm always wrong. Crime and Punishment is certainly dealing with serious things but it is also gripping, funny, and sad. Dostoevsky puts you in the room the way many 19th century writers do not. The characters in the book are so finely drawn you feel like you coul know them now, which makes the whole thing that much more disturbing. "
"113",112,"Jordan","I am currently reading this book again. Each time I do I feel like I am reading a new book. Unlike his magnum opus, The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment reads more like a prose poem. The mind of the main character isn't given all at once, but slowly unfolds to the reader. The artistry of this book is the fact that the physical action compels the reading throughout, but even more engaging is the psychological story behind the physical story. Dramatic irony abounds, particularly in the several places where Raskolnikov confesses - yet without repentance, and so is not reconciled. An interesting take on the detective story, since the reader already knows everything. Rather, the reader is left to piece together Raskolnikov's psyche as he descends through hell and into paradise. Cf. Augustine's Confessions, and Dante's Divine Comedy."

"117",116,"Doug Stephens iii","My favorite Dostoevsky novel"
"118",117,"frisco - فریسکو","Rinuncio a lodare questo libro e la sua attualità perché altrimenti non la finirei più.Delitto e castigo tratta di un delitto e della conseguente colpa/pena che prenderà vita grazie ad un percorso, sia geografico che mentale, dall' ""occidente razionale"" che sfida la morale comune, all'intimismo della redenzione psicologica.E' difficile trovare armonia tra la dualità degli opposti in ognuno di noi; forse non è azzardato pensare ad una sorta di parallelo tra il Medioevo e la storia di Rodion Romanovič Raskol'nikov.Nel Medioevo era la Volontà Divina a decidere se il presunto colpevole, gettato in acqua dentro un sacco, fosse o meno responsabile del reato: se colpevole, la malvagità alla quale si era venduto non avrebbe permesso il suo annegamento; se innocente, avrebbe trovato la morte sott'acqua e la redenzione dalle accuse.Raskol'nikov, colpevole, potrebbe alla fine farla franca ma ricerca la colpevolezza e si consegna spontaneamente alle autorità, fedele a quell'idea cristiana per cui l'atto del soffrire ha un effetto purificatore sullo spirito umano.Tra i personaggi c'è chi emerge di più e chi di meno, ma esiste una sola voce corale che li racchiude tutti perché tutti sono necessari, giocano per contrasti con i loro caratteri così diversi ma mai assoluti; non c'è in assoluto buono e cattivo, stupido o intelligente, tutti sono veri e compositi così com'è composita e stratificata la realtà che si trovano a dover vivere."
"119",118,"Dipika Bangera","I have had the privilege to read Russian authors since childhood thanks to my maternal uncle. My favourite two have always been Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Anton Chekov.This is one of my favourite books and I will continue reading it time and again. If anyone has nailed human nature so precisely, the honour definitely goes to Fyodor for this classic novel. A well told tale about human redemption where the crime and punishment both take a back seat. A must read for a book lover . I do wish I could rate it above 5 stars."
"120",119,"A","This blew me away. Flawless execution on Dostoyevsky's part in depicting the innate egoism of Raskolnikov. He thinks himself equipped of this Napoleonic personality, where, in the interests of a higher social good, he possesses a moral right to kill, which is a mentality he stands by for the entirety of the story. Although towards the end he tries to pay his dues, to Raskolnikov it's more of a personal crime that he has to pay for, the fact that he eventually turned himself in, and that he didn't have the convictions to stand by and remain faithful to his ideologies, as opposed to the actual murder itself. The whole psychology surrounding Raskolnikov and how he deals with what he's done and the relationships he then forms with a variety of equally sad characters is amazingly well done.Dostoyevsky has this remarkable talent to show the humanity in people who's characters aren't often alighted upon with such alacrity. You develop sympathy and even empathy for these characters, irregardless of what misdeeds they've done and they're represented in such a truthful way that it's clear to see why Dostoevsky is considered one of the great writers. He draws you so far into the world of these people that you honestly hope Raskolnikov gets away with his crimes, you start to understand the ideologies that he's tried to live by and it brings into light a lot of moral questions that often go ignored.While I think that the epilogue could have been scrapped entirely, the whole novel is compelling."
"121",120,"San San","I have just finished this book and I thought that fortunately for me when I find it then reading it whithin a week. There have a lot of things about this book go on my mind. I thought about Raskolnikov- a special character. I believe that I can sympathize with his bcoz of his personality that I can see when I finished each steps of this book.I cant say anything else about him bcoz all of his life, his choose, his awareness, his anxiety is presented clearly throught the series of his stories. I only say that, the kindly of each people always exist under their act,but, Not only other people but also yourself cant be see it.In conclusion, Crime and Punishment is one of the most favourite books in my bookself. Hope that more people could be read it and realize something from this great book."
"122",121,"Laurent","Thought-provoking, accessible masterpieceThis is the kind of book which I would recommend to people who want to start out in literature. The story, about a murderer and his struggles to prove to himself his significance in the world and then deal with consequences of this is unique.The story is highly relevant to our age, intersting and deeply confrontational at a human level that it will engage most readers. The beauty of it is that, while being pretty dense, the language and style is definately accessible. Dostoevsky's study of the human mind, and the way in which we can actually imprison and torture ourselves with guilt and grief is facinating. "
"123",122,"Marian","I was pleasantly surprised to find this was a much easier read than other Russian classics I've read, as it had a much smaller cast of characters. Apparently Russians really like to change up people's names on a regular basis. Anyhow, it explores the psychologically of murder and guilt. A story that is still relevant 150 years later."
"124",123,"Tim Mccollough","Best book I've ever read. I felt insane as I was reading the book. Yes, that is different than normal. No, I'm not talking to myself. Fine, I might be. Who's talking? Show yourself! "
"125",124,"Martin Handfield","Crime and Punishment is mandatory reading for anyone planning to visit St-Petersburg. Better yet, it is the best book to pack and read while in the city itself. Lush with descriptions, you feel as if you are wandering yourself the streets of 19th Century ""Peters"" alongside a sickly, troubled Raskolnikov reminiscing over and over about the crime he foolishly committed. Rife with details about the culture and state of mind of the Russian people at the time, the author is generous with side stories and exquisitely detailed supporting characters, from the deeply religious Sonia to the boisterous, naive but golden hearted Razumikhin.If you ever find yourself in this most beautiful of Russian cities, make sure pay Dostoyevsky last house a visit, to walk the hallways where stories like this one where thought out, and the office where the words were put to paper, under Dostoyevsky's wife loving eyes. I dare you not to feel a pang in your heart, and maybe a tear of two in your eyes..."
"126",125,"Faez","What brings me back to this perfect novel is that here Dostoyevsky achieve perfection of form as well as his usual depth of insights. "
"127",126,"Andrew Parkinson","Crime and Punishment is the window into the mind of Raskolnikov, a university drop-out whose theory that the death of one elderly pawnbroker would serve as the catalyst for the elevation of his financial, social and philosophical status becomes the source of his moral torment in practice.Told with the attention to detail seen in Herman Melville’s Moby Dick, while questioning issues of morality in a way that reflects the later Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov, Dostoyevsky provides an insight into the psychological conflict that follows Raskolnikov’s actions. While the murder of Alonya and Lizaveta establishes the framework of his inner crisis, the obfuscation of what is right and wrong throughout the novel can be applicable to most decisions and judgements one reaches in everyday life.Of Raskolnikov, I found myself repulsed and sympathetic in equal measure; his character is one that cannot be boiled down to cut-and-dry terms as he manifests all the complexities contradictions of what it is to be human. Meanwhile, the characters that orbit Raskolnikov illuminate the consequences of his actions upon the society in which he navigates. These characters always feel believable and each have their own stories worthy of similar detailed analysis to Raskolnikov (particularly Sonya and the Machiavellian Svidrigailov).I suspect that further secrets and wonders will be unveiled through repeated reading of the novel. Crime and Punishment encapsulates the reason I invest so much time in literature: although I became immersed in the environment of the novel, it has already affected the way I perceive my own world."
"128",127,"Neil Coulter","Crime and Punishment is a novel that has haunted me for much of my adult life. That's not because it is partly a ghost story, nor because it's one of those books that I've never read but always felt like I should (this read-through was my third or fourth, though I didn't read it the first time until after college). It haunts me because every time I read it I get drawn into it, into Raskolnikov's thoughts and terrors. Reading Crime and Punishment makes me feel the weight of the novel more than any other book I've read. I always feel that I'm living Raskolnikov's delirium right along with him. That makes it a somewhat scary book to pick up again, but it also invites me--maybe even dares me--to come back to it.Dostoevsky creates an eerie St. Petersburg, an absurd, surreal world in which a suspected murderer is allowed to roam the streets until he decides to turn himself in, a world in which everyone is obsessed with the idea of justice, but true justice is almost nowhere to be found and rarely rewarded. After the initial action at the pawnbroker's flat, the dream-like scenes shift from one to another, very slowly building in intensity. For me the turning point is Raskolnikov's encounter with Sonya, when she reads him the story of Lazarus. From that point on, the novel speeds ahead and every word everyone speaks is compelling and important. The conversations are long, and they make me think, with some nostalgia, about a time when people really did talk together at length, rather than in short bursts of social media updates. In some ways I feel like I'm looking in a mirror as I read about Raskolnikov's inner conflict, and the contradictory ways that the conflict manifests itself in his behaviors toward other people. When he carefully crafts words to be deliberately hurtful, but while speaking the words is unable to open his eyes or look at the person he's speaking to, I see myself in my worst moments. His constant self-analytical, self-doubting inner life is very much how I sometimes feel about myself. I haven't committed murder, but in Raskolnikov Dostoevsky challenges the reader to consider any sin. When Raskolnikov tries to believe that his crime was really not very bad, I think about the times that I try to minimize the seriousness of any of my sinfulness. Can I really believe that I'm any prettier than Raskolnikov in my thoughts, words, and actions? Against that bleak backdrop, the redemption of Raskolnikov and the sacrificial love of Sonya are some of the most amazing, wonderful things in any novel. The epilogue makes me yearn for that completeness and togetherness that Raskolnikov is, we hope, on his way to discovering. The rest of Raskolnikov's story that Dostoevsky hints at at the end of the novel is merely his invitation to the reader to be the rest of Raskolnikov's story. (Though I hope that in heaven I'll be able to hear Dostoevsky tell more of the story.)Crime and Punishment is a difficult, challenging book, but it's one of the best. I know I'll keep returning to it, as frightening as it is. For this read-through, I read Jessie Coulson's translation from 1953. It holds up really well, with only a few odd word choices or constructions here and there. Previously I had only read the Constance Garnet, and I was interested to try a different translation. I'll never be able to pick just one translation as The Best, but I can certainly recommend Coulson's as one good choice among many."

"131",130,"Ali"," I was hellbent on giving this book 4 stars, but I simply couldn't. Yes, it did seem a bit- just a bit -tedious at some point, but that was my own fault. Other than that, the book is thoroughly enticing, despite a few minor comments. And that cliffhanger at the end, my God! My favorite part, though, is Raskolnikov's inner conflict, the way guilt and pride were both gnawing at his sanity.A beautiful book, to say the least."
"132",131,"Bruce Denham","One of the first books that really took me along for the ride and put me into someone else's paranoid mind with such convincingly great details. "
"133",132,"Sashinka","I first read this while living in St Petersburg literally around the corner from where it was written. I was so excited that every street, market, bridge etc were all familiar to me and it really helped me gain a sympathy and understanding of Raskolnikov. I absolutely love this book, even though nothing really happens in it!"
"134",133,"Faysal Subhani","Anyone who has ever sinned will enjoy this book. In fact, only the devil, who feels no remorse and angels, who don't sin won't enjoy this book. for everyone else, it's a must read. Dostoevsky, like most Russian authors have a talent for describing the human character in very realistic and relatable terms. The way he gets through the various manifestations of guilty is just incredible. One all time favourite books. And it's got its fair share of action too, very unlike 19th century novels."
"135",134,"Irene","So many people have commented thoroughly on this one already, I think I'll pass.It's an easy read. It's long but still easy. And quite enjoyable. I learned a couple of things or three. Now I know that killing is alright as long as you regret it afterwards. Or even if you don't, it's not really much of a big deal. Just kiding. I really liked how the reader is drawn into the character's mind. The psychological study, as someone put it here on GR, is fantastic.I do think the ending was rushed (lately I find all endings to be rushed so maybe *I* am the problem). I mean, we've read so much about the main characters and their past lives, and their illnesses, and then the secondary characters and their pasts and illnesses. And then there's this long dinner party. And the many times the character talks to the policeman. And the doctor. Oh, and the best friend (aka angel in disguise). Everything feels so long and described in detail. And then, bam! Don't want to spoil the ending, but seriously, the length of a clousure should be proportional to the length of the book. It's ok for Snowhite and the Prince to marry in three lines. It's a short story. It's not ok for a final resolution to take two pages within a 540 pages novel!!"
"136",135,"Matti","Probably the best book I've ever read. At times I was really upset with the behaviour of the leading chararacter Raskolnikov. How can he be like that?!? And to see his slow descent into mental illness was something that made me wanna cry out. Dostoyevsky has a profound knowledge of human psyche, his characters feel so alive. I was never the same after reading this. Thanks to my beloved sister for giving me this book!"
"137",136,"Gabriela","I didn't understand why this book was great until almost half-way through it. In the beginning I only felt the dreariness and couldn't sympathize at all with Raskolnikov. I started to really like the novel only at the scene where Raskolnikov connected with Sonya. It's as if, he didn't really become a human being to me until he proved that he could transcend himself.Dostoyevsky is the only author who can make me cry through description! Also, surprised that this novel is a love story! Most girls in my law and literature class were offended with Sonya's dependence and lack of personality. They thought the ""golden-heart prostitute"" image was flat. But, I liked her most. For me, it is painfully beautiful to see women give grace to destructive men who don't deserve it. As professor Boyle stated, this novel could have been called ""Sin and Redemption"" instead, because in a way, the crime and the punishment didn't really matter.Finally, as my best friend Christina said on the novel "" Life is complicated and cruel...Bad people can still be useful/do good things, thus it is impossible to ever rid ourselves of them - they have to go on their own accord."""
"138",137,"Marissa","If there is one thing you can say about Dostoyevsky that everyone would agree with, it's probably that you either love him or you hate him.I understand why plenty of people could read this and not like it, or even not get through it, but I am not one of those people.To me, Crime and Punishment is one of those books that everyone should read. Yes it's about crime, but it's also about the inherence of evil versus the inherence of goodness, what that looks like on human faces, how to come back from a place of mental despair, and the power of redemption."

"141",140,"Saket Suryesh","Like most of Dostoevsky books does not have a story which spans a long period or follows a complex story plot. The action in the story happens quickly with the murder of Lizuveta in the beginning itself. Rest of the book is psycho-philosophical evaluation of the event, the backdrop and the hero of the book, Rodya. Amazing book. Great writing not only entertains, they answer some questions and set you on path to discover your own answers for other questions which they leave you with. This is one such book. Are some people worthy of being treated above justice, on account of their greatness? How do we assess that they are great enough to be entitled of special treatment and be allowed to get away with murder, in a literal sense here?"
"142",141,"Annabelle Winters","My favorite novel. "
"143",142,"Chris Bauer","I thought this book was amazing, maybe not as good as notes from the underground, but definitely very good. The pretense of this book is that the main character Rodion Raskolnikov is a very poor man who used to be a student. Through the eyes of Rodion, Fyodor does an amazing job of describing the troubles of being poor in nineteenth century Russia, leaving out not even the smallest details. One example of this is when he describes Rodion trying to sneak past his land ladies apartment so he doesn't have to have the uncomfortable conversation with her about why he is so far behind on his payments to her. Fyodor also does, once again, an amazing job of describing the inner workings of the main character, and really showing us what makes this character tick, and push him to do what he does. Fyodor uses his words to paint an amazing picture of a man who is impoverished, and is internally conflicted. The main conflict inside of Rodion is whether or not to kill the pawnbroker in St. Petersburg. This seems at first like a strange crime since she is his main source of revenue. However, Dostoyevsky once again does his job to make you understand why Rodion does what he does. Whilst inside of a St. Petersburg tavern he meets a man named Marmeladov, and sees the type of poverty that he and his family live in. He even meets Marmeladov's daughter who has been forced into prostitution in order to make money to support the family. After seeing where his life could go to, he also over hears a student talking to an officer about how much better off society would be if the Pawnbroker Alyona were to be killed and her money distributed amongst the poor. The way in which this section is written is very convincing, it is done so that it is understandable to see how a mentally unstable individual such as Rodion would be convinced by this. Rodion throughout the book goes through these dramatic swings between wanting to kill Alyona, and being disgusted at himself for this. This, along with the argument of the student allow Dostoyevsky to make Rodion still seem like a human, even after cutting down and old woman and her sister with an axe. Though I would still say that this is a terrible thing to do, by giving the reasoning for it, it allows you to not feel like a monster for still feeling bad for Rodion, and his situation.If you would like to read a book about how peoples environment can shape their actions, and read the story of a conflicted individual who I feel everyone will be able to relate to at some level, I would greatly recommend this book. "
"144",143,"Kelsey","Raskolnikov is definitely one of the most complicated characters in all of literature. Infatuated by the idea of becoming a Napoleon, he creates a spontaneous theory of being above crime and law, and is drawn to murder as if it were some unforeseen force. I found myself defending Raskolnikov throughout the novel and dreading his capture or his own pathetic confession because of his seemingly benevolent disposition. You can't help but pity him despite his depraved actions and insufferable self loathing..you hold on to a hope of eventual atonement. Dostoevsky's writing is swift, to the point, and riddled with such dark realism that the reader feels the terror of a murderer who committed such an emotionless crime. As the repercussions of his ""crime"" slyly bite at his ankles, you begin to feel the complete degradation of the soul of a guilty criminal..and that is the reader's punishment."

"150",149,"Seth","I listened to this book on CD while I was driving from Virginia to Idaho with my sister, Charity. The key scene in the book is awful, and we almost stopped listening at that point. I'm glad we kept with it, though. This story is a warning against over-thinking things, disconnecting yourself from the world and people around you, and living life based on theories instead of living it based on love and Christian virtue. Through all of Rodya's study and academic observation, he has developed a philosophy about government and social order. He is convinced that this philosophy will change the world. He is so sure of it that he is willing to commit an awful crime in an attempt to prove it or to show his commitment to it. The whole book is about his internal struggle afterwards--can he keep hold to this theory after experiencing its horrid results first hand, or is he willing to abandon his it and connect with the world again? He is both the hero and the villain of the book. In the end, this is a story about redemption and about the power of long-suffering, patience and love to soften even the hardest hearts. This book helped me to be less judgmental. It made me reconsider my feelings about capital punishment. It helped me to better understand how political structures and social philosophies like Communism and Nazi Facism came into being. I had just finished law school when I listened to the book, and I had been particularly unnerved by how some professors seemed to live in theory rather than reality. I went to one lecture called ""The New Morality""--which was previously called ""immorality"". He had thought it through and rationalized everything thoroughly. There is a temptation to over-think and over-complicate life. Really, I think it just comes down to the two great commandments--love God, and love your fellow man--and to Jesus's counsel that ""By their fruits ye shall know them."" Stray from those principles, and you can rationalize anything. This is a great book, and I highly recommend it. "
"151",150,"Sneha Yerra","I don't know why.. but, the whole book made sense. many of the things the characters went through.. I could relate.. and each sentence seemed like the truth of life. The way the protagonist loved his family, yet wanted to be away from them.. didn't want to see them , he wanted to see only the girl , maybe thinking that only she could understand him or maybe she wouldn't judge him as she's in the same situation as he is.. , the drunkard repenting over how he neglected his family , but, still wouldn't , couldn't do anything .. and I never thought that this was the tale of the guilt until my psychology lecturer defined it so.. maybe it is.. I need to read the book once again to see if it is the case.. but, it is for me a tale of fear .. Anyday , my favorite book!"

"156",155,"Beth Cain","The man was a genius. I read in one of the footnotes that Dostoyevsky was influenced by another writer who invented fantastical realism. I think fantastical realism is the perfect description for the writing style in this book. It depicts reality, but distorted slightly through the viewpoint of a slightly deranged killer. Raskolnikov is constantly pushing against the limits of reality. I picture a film in black and white where the camera keeps zooming in on him, disheveled, as he sweats and makes exaggerated, suspicious gestures. Dostoyevsky uses Raskolnikov’s illness to blur the line between what is real and what is simply the illusions of a fevered brain. This entire story explores the vast gray area between black and white. Good and evil, poverty and wealth, madness and sanity. The depth of material in this work is astonishing. I’d love to take a course on Dostoyevsky someday, as I feel as though I barely scratched the surface in this complex novel."
"157",156,"Neeraja S","Raskolnikov, a young student in the grips of utter poverty, tries to rationalize the meaning of crime. He convinces himself to murder an old, miserly pawn-broker, originally with the intent to rob her and put the money to good use, helping his family climb out of the rut of poverty. But as he sets out to execute the crime, something in him doesn't agree with his will, yet he brings himself to murder the old woman, and her sister, who unfortunately happens to enter the scene. Raskolnikov faces a lot of ordeal in trying to escape the scene of crime, but thanks to a streak of luck, he manages to scurry out. Although his grand scheme hinged on the loot he would rob, he somehow didn't have any interest in robbing, and in his fluster, he carelessly scooped in some random trinkets and some odd money. Even this little loot, he buries under a stone and has no interest in touching them. He spends the next few days in fever and hallucinations, driving himself insane on why he committed the crime, if he still justified the crime, or if he should confess it all to give himself some peace.How curious a man...he commits a crime that he thinks is not a crime, and yet he can't be in peace. He is skeptical about God, his intellect and rational mind assuages him that he merely killed a parasitic old woman who was tricking the poor and collecting their hard-earned money, that the money he robbed could give himself a new future, save his family and help him do much more good to the people of Petersburg, than he ever could as a law-abiding citizen residing in a little hole of filth, with not even enough money to wash and feed himself. Despite the logical arithmetic of killing two to save many, there was something in him that wouldn't stop nagging him - his conscience. Here is where I merged with Raskolnikov. Although I am not contemplating any dire crime, I can relate to his qualms of stepping over the barriers to do something unconventional and extraordinary. And no matter how many hours, days, weeks, months and years are spent in trying to straighten out the logic and the rationality of it all, something never quietens. And there is no way out. Raskolnikov couldn't have walked away without executing his actions, neither could he be at peace after his actions. Having stuck oneself in the horns of a moral-dilemma, there is no painless way out. And the scars are deep and will remain. It just becomes a matter of which horn to gouge oneself with. And in Raskolnikov's case, he gouged himself through both horns.And that is the essence of the book. It tests the limits of human conscience. It's a debate between the rational mind and the inexplicable voice of the conscience. Dostoevsky is a master analyst, and an astute psychologist. No matter how many times I have already talked about his perceptive genius, I can't tire out. Here is an era wherein DNA fingerprinting and other sophisticated means of criminal investigation are unheard of. Yet, he weaves a suspenseful drama of how the crime is solved, with no material evidence...but all based on psychology. This is Dostoevsky's trademark... he used the same ""double-edged sword of psychology"" in the courtroom drama of The Brother's Karamazov. But in this book, he doesn't go into as much explicit analysis.He propounds a thesis on what makes a man extraordinary. What made the great Kings and leaders who are now immortal in the history of Mankind, so great? They could break rules and make their own. They didn't subject themselves to the letter of the law, they were brave enough to rise above it, to realize that certain rules need to be broken, that morality has to be redefined in their hands, and that only their essence needs to seep through for them to murder a few to save millions, and still have a peaceful conscience. Those who can't step over such man-made pickets of rules, and who are unable to see such moral clarity and act with conviction, are but ordinary. Raskolnikov strove to be such an extraordinary man, but failed. He failed despite his intellect, and despite his lack of faith in God. I marvel at Dostoevsky's deftness in glorifying humanity, no matter what decision Raskolnikov took. He stresses on the innate goodness residing in all men, despite their efforts to rationalize crime, and be blind to belief and retribution from a higher authority.Through his other characters, he also compares the shades of legality and morality, and how each measures the goodness in a person. There are many men who circumvent and stay clever and obedient in the eyes of the law, yet their moral character is far more loathsome than a person like Raskolnikov, who goes against law and commits the highest ""sin"" - murder. Conscience is one factor, the other is the intention. Many philosophers and spiritualists have emphasized that an action by itself cannot be classified as good or bad... it is the intent behind it, and the purpose it serves. This is cleverly brought out in the book.Another aspect that comes out is, how the murder affects Raskolnikov physically and mentally. The weight of his conscience and his immense resistance to the crime makes Raskolnikov feverish and delirious... these physical manifestations implying the psychosomatic effects of his inner tempest. Dostoevsky hints at how a person physically and mentally wears out every time he works against his conscience. This reminded me of the Horcruxes in Harry Potter. In my interpretation, this is exactly what Rowling also seems to imply. Every time Voldemort commits a horrendous crime, his entire soul suffers and splits into pieces, so much so that he deteriorates in both spirit and body.As I mentioned, I'm sure there is perhaps more to the book that I have missed and need to re-read. But such is the beauty of this classic. It analyzes all the multiple complex facets of morality, crime and punishments, packed into words that are so impassioned and vivid. Truly a masterpiece."

"163",162,"David Schaafsma","I first read Crime and Punishment in my late teens. In those years I read several of the great Dostoevsky novels—The Idiot, Underground Man, and especially The Brothers Karamazov and C & P. In various bar and coffee shop conversations over the years about various “the BEST _____ ever” (for instance, who is the hottest actress in the history of cinema, Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca or Lauren Bacall in To Have or Have Not?) The Brothers K and C & P would top my Greatest Novels of All Time list, usually BK first, C & P second. I actually named one of my brooding gray cats Raskolnikov (Rascal, for short), so there: proof that it wasn’t a trivial thing for me, this book. ☺I come back to C & P more than four decades later, as part of the process of my revisiting some of my greatest reads, and also reading some other Great Books that had been on my bucket list for decades, such as Anna Karenina and In Search of Lost Time. Living' the (Reading) Dream, man!Spoiler Alert: I want to talk about these books, so if you have never read them and still might, you might want to skip this review. Some reviews I write in part for others; some of them I write mainly for myself, as a kind of autobiography of my reading. This I put in the latter category though if you have read it, tell me what you think of what I think.So most people who have never even read this book already know from the simple title that a crime has been committed, and most probably know a guy kills a woman or two. Then we know there is a punishment that follows the crime. Simple. You need 500 plus pages to tell that?! The short answer is yes. But the crime is basically what happens in the first hundred or so pages, and we don’t know why, really. We never get a good reason, actually, which is also part of the point. A guy named Raskolnikov kills his pawnbroker Alyona and robs her, though he never does anything with what he steals. In the process, his daughter Lizaveta walks in so he kills her, too. So that’s the crime. The last 4/5 of the book is in part about the “punishment” which unless you omit the short epilogue, does not involve institutional punishment. The last 4/5 focuses on psychological and spiritual self-punishment or what Dostoevsky always refers to as “suffering.” And various considerations of what Dostoevsky never calls sin in a parade of wild and wonderful characters.At the outset of the novel, we learn that former college student Raskolnikov lives in St. Petersburg, in relative poverty, spinning his wheels, drinking and hanging with women (or, whoring, though this is the nineteenth century, so the references here are vague, usually) (things that we know Dostoevsky also did much of his life, in addition to gambling). As things proceed we see Rask has published an essay about how there are some people, usually great ones, who are “above the law,” people who can do whatever they want and get away with it.Nietzsche, a nineteenth century philosopher, called such folks “supermen,” those who rise above the moral precepts of the time to achieve greatness or just to prove that moral systems do not apply to them. Rask commits the murders in part as a way of working out this stupid theory, though he is poor and could also use the cash but never does. He needs the money, but when he has it, he tends to give it away to others. Not that he is a good guy; he is a murderer, but he has some charitable aspects to his character revealed from time time. Sometimes he despicably tries to dismiss his murders as trivial, but he never gets off the hook for it, ever, especially with himself. This is not an isolated thing, this murder for philosophical principle, by the way. In the twentieth century, the two teenagers Leopold and Loeb read Nietzsche and just to test the theory killed a kid randomly in Chicago and fried for it. They had the same thing in mind: Great men will do Whatever They Want and not experience Guilt. They will rise above it, they think or, as most novelists and moralists decide, sink below it. The theory is an empty one, of course as most humans with any commons sense would see, but intellectuals, eh, Dostoevsky (D, hereafter), they are kinda blowin' in the winds of theoretical fashion. Arrogant, they all think they wanna be Napoleon.This might begin to summarize simply the moral position of Nietzsche: You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist.In other words, there’s no God, and no religious or ethical system that must apply to all people.Anyway, Rask is painfully aware his mother and sister will do anything to help him financially. And he’s maybe in love with prostitute Sonya, who is doing this terrible thing to make money for her family. He fears his own sister (Dunya) will do similar sorts of prostituting (she has already, for instance, agreed to marry rich jerk Luzhin, just to help out the family that has gone poor supporting student Rask). But he never does anything with money except give some that he has to Sonya's family left destitute at the death of their drunken father, Marmeledov. So he's strange and mostly unlikable our anti-hero Rask, though he is fascinating always and even a little likable sometimes to me, as I am also pretty fallible myself, so I have empathy for him sometimes.Later, we might see a kind of “moral” in this story about a man like RASK who doesn’t believe in God, from Dostoevsky through Nietzsche: He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.That happens to Rask, and others in this book. They suffer, facing their demons or monsters.And no one depicts suffering like Dostoevsky. His predecessor and mentor in Russian literature, Gogol, also knew suffering, though while he is similarly recognized for creating poor folk grotesques, his are often comic. D references and creates tributes to his Master in this work, but most people don’t see D’s grotesque, suffering folks as all that funny. In this reading, I saw them as funny sometimes, however. There’s satire throughout, especially of the upper classes. D and literature in general don't usually make fun of the poor with any success. We see poverty and its attendant horrors in many ways in this book, and we come to care about them and their needs. They suffer and we can see this is central to humanity.There’s some action in this book, of course; in fact it is sometimes quite the page turner as we wonder what is going to happen, is Rask going to get caught, and so on, but the centerpiece is dialogue in the service of character, and it works breath-takingly well here. Most of the male characters are tortured drunken philosophizers who go on page after page speaking their madness and grief. And most of these crazy flawed folks are indeed men doing most of the talking. The women are less crazy, and less flawed, on balance, and mostly crazy BECAUSE of the men. But the talk is amazing, it is the heart of the book. When men drink and talk, he has that down, (this book came out of a failed attempt at a draft he called The Drunks), but the ideas that flow from their mouths, the thinking about the meaning of life, the struggles with love and morality, all this is incredible.Does it go on a bit long? Some say yes, but not for me. We need to know what is going to happen and why for Rask, but we also need to broaden the lens and see others who are also suffering in their own ways. We need foils for understanding Rask in a sociological sense. And it’s often very funny in these long stretches, so the length is worth, in my opinion. The drunken Marmeledov, for instance, is pathetic, but he's also hilarious and insightful and finally tragic. He’s a full and rich and complex character. Luzhin, the self-centered lawyer who is for a time engaged to Dunya, he’s a world class jerk, but an interesting one. While Rask is never excused for his murders, these other men and their iniquities help us see what can be some goodness at times in Rask, and appreciate the remarkable end of the book. The also drunken philanderer Svidrigailov is a (drunken, of course) jerk, but he also takes care of Marmeledov’s consumptive widow, and after her horrific death, her children, including her step-daughter Sonya (she’s the one who has become a prostitute to help her family, whom Rask sort of falls in love with, though simultaneously torments from time to time) in part because he is trying to bribe her into marriage. He also tries to bribe Rask’s sister Dunya into marriage, though he is already engaged, and fails. He becomes a central character in the book because he (BIG spoiler) makes the decision to commit suicide, which makes him a foil to Rask, who contemplates this, but instead chooses confession, hard labor in Siberia with Sonya able to come north with him and visit regularly. Another great character is the Columbo-like (look it up! You have google! Peter Falk!) bumbling and rumpled old genius detective Porfiry, who finally convinces Rask to confess and give himself up. Rask’s great friend Razumikhin is wonderful in defense of Rask against all evidence to the contrary, who also agrees to take care of his sister and mother. He’s a strange man, also a drunk (D knows drunkenness, it’s clear) but good where most men are not in this tome. The story is one of final and not easily achieved redemption, but we only see this in the very final pages of this long novel, as he finally accepts the love of Sonya. Sonya, the sort of “Madonna-Whore” (a long time literary stereotype, I know) of this book, is essentially the moral center of the book, with her unwaivering and not easily achieved faith in God. She’s convincingly Good. Dunya and their mother are also good, giving up everything for her love of her son. Nastasya cares for Rask, too, She's also wholly good. The late goodbye scene between Rask and his mother (totally a good woman) is affecting and powerful. The scenes between Rask and (totally good) sister Dunya are powerful, too. Do you see a pattern here? Sure, Sonya is a prostitute, but only in necessity for her destitute family. Women are often saints here, they make the right choices, or most of them do. Maybe that is a flaw, that D deifies women; this is a kind of cliché. But there are a couple weak and wicked women in this book, too. The women don't always seems quite as real as the men sometimes because they are a little one-dimentionally good, but they are still great, they seem real to me.But it is LOVEthat redeems Raskolnikov, the love of a woman, Sonya, and his mother and sister, too, but mainly Sonya, and while it seems like a stretch she would care for him, she does, and both he and we come to believe in her goodness and love.Some favorite scenes? Sonya’s reading of the Biblical Lazurus story to Rask is ELECTRIC, unforgettable. The best scene in the whole book for my money. I was once religious and I know that passage from the Bible; I say now that I am agnostic, but that scene, that felt like an indictment, a promise to me, in my own lost-soul-ness. The scenes with Porfiry are great and the scene in particular where Porfiry finally accuses Rask is also ELECTRIC, I promise, as is the final scene of the book. The lyrical final scenes with Svidrigailov are wonderful, powerful and surprising; I had NO idea he was going to do that. Anytime Mom and Rask or Dunya and Rask are talking with each other, these scenes are poignant. Marmeledov's drunken talk with Rask is wonderfully comic early on. When I first read this book I was “churched” in a Calvinism that seemed darkly consistent with Dostoevsky’s dark, angsty world view. Later, I came to like the work of D-influenced South African writer J. M. Coetzee, who actually wrote his novel The Master of St. Petersburg about Dostoevsky. I still love these writers, though my views on matters of faith have shifted considerably. But as a veteran doubter, I liked D’s anguished struggles with faith and the meaning of life more than anyone else’s writing and thinking. And they led me, in my existentialist period, into Kafka, Sartre, Camus, and others. Camus’s The Stranger and Kafka’s “Metamorphosis” owe things to C & P. Hamlet and Macbeth are anguished precursors, as is D’s own “Underground Man."" Anyway, doubt and anguish have always seemed more interesting to me than joyful faith and happiness, and still do. I think the world is more complicated than mere celebration, though I have much to celebrate, too. But the world is a dark place now, as I see it, with a lot of ugliness in it. Dostoevsky resonates with the present for me as much as it ever did.C & P is as much a psychological and sociological novel (about various forms of “madness” in nineteenth century Russia) as it is a philosophical renunciation of nihilism, though it is richly both, and much worth reading for these aspects. It’s a real thriller, too, a cat and mouse story with the focus on Rask and his interior experience of suffering, but it is also a novel the literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin would identify as a “cultural forum” on issues in D's times in Russia. Raskolnikov is a jerk, a wonderfully reprehensible character that D refuses to sentimentalize, but as much as we despise him for some of his ridiculous youthful views—his ideas about the superman display the worst of the intellectualism of his times—we also come to appreciate him in various ways. Dostoevsky is a thinker, but he is first and foremost a poet of the heart and what used to be called “soul” unapologetically.The translation by Pevear and Volokhonsky is supposedly the best ever, much lauded, and I can’t say, not speaking the language, but it was fabulous to read. I read the Constance Garnett version 40 years ago. This is the one to read now, everyone says, so choose this one if you are going to read or reread. I also have read in the past couple years their Anna Karenina and Underground Man and Brothers Karamazov, so I can attest they are wonderful writers/interpreters.Finally, yes, it is (again) one of the best things I have ever read, and I highly recommend it. You may find it a tad long for contemporary tastes, but hey, you also have David Foster Wallace, who is very long. Pynchon is long. Ulysses was long. Sometimes great things are long! And maybe he is too nineteenth century modernist for you, finally. But for me he is great, deserving of his high status in the canon of world literature. Or, if you hate the very idea of Great Books and canons, it is just one hell of a read."
"164",163,"Giada","This is, hands down, one of the best book I've read. I know it's not an original way to start a review but it's really something that must be said.Raskolnikov. Oh boy, Raskolnikov. I found myself having a weird crush on him right from the beginning - hey, do not judge me. Dostoevskij managed to capture every shade of his personality, to unveil every tiny corner of his troubled mind, to make him real. That's what Raskolnikov is: a real man. A great mind that has to cope with the dullness of reality; this is a fight that I'm sure many of us had to go through at least once in a lifetime (even once a day), and the experience has taught us that the outcomes can only be two. The first one concerns a passive acceptance: accepting our place in this life, embracing it and looking for happiness in a blissful ""ignorance"" that we impose on ourselves. The second one is a brutal reaction leading to madness and to sick actions that deny every effort to adapt to the world we live in. Raskolnikov can't choose to accept. He wants to achieve something superior, he wants to make a difference. But he's also aware of his limits: he's not Napoleon, but he can be one, he wants to be one, and he has to start somewhere. So he plans the crime: killing the old, unpleasant lady is nothing but a step that will bring him closer to the very highest, ultimate point. But as he starts to plan the murder, he also starts to question himself about his mental sanity. And, nevertheless, who would possibly understand his exquisite plans, who could get the real meaning of his actions, without calling him murderer? Probably no one. There's so much to say on him, on all the other characters: every single one of them is a key that provides food for thought and all of them have a central role; but I don't want to keep boring you.Another good thing I'd like to mention (and then I promise, I'm going to leave): after reading Crime and Punishment, I can finally fully appreciate the movie ""Match Point"". It's brilliant. Thank you Woody Allen for liking Dostoevskij.Well, go read it, now!"

"167",166,"Zachary Barov","This is my all time favorite novel. This book made me feel more emotion than anything I have ever read. I learned interesting ways to present characters thought, not just by saying so-and-so was upset, but by going through paragraphs of details. You get an overall view of what people think and feel that is relatable and believable. I learned many ways to use dialogue to show thoughts and feelings as well. What I enjoyed most was the anxiety I felt all through reading it. It really puts you into the mind set of the main character which is something i really want to work on - making the reader feel what the character feels. To the very end I had no idea what was going to happen, every page was a surprise but not in a cheesy or cliche way."
"168",167,"Zachary Wingerd","powerful--my three favorite scenes are 1) Marmaladov's drunken speech at the tavern in which he gives his view of sinners, saints, and heaven. 2) Sonya reads the raising of Lazarus to the doubting Raskolnikov. 3) Epilogue: through Raskolnikov's acceptance of suffering and Sonya he accepts a true image of Christ"
"169",168,"Mark Davis","Fyodor Dostoevsky's classic is certainly one I was not expecting to fly though: you are free to call me illiterate if you please, but I generally have a difficult time getting through 700+ page books written more than a century ago.Instead of the dull, monotonous, super-pretentious novel I was expecting, Crime and Punishment is one of the most psychologically thrilling pieces of fiction I have encountered. The characters are all brilliantly fleshed out, and the story zooms along at a brisk pace despite its length. Dostoevsky's incredibly long paragraphs (my high school english teacher would have had a field day if I wrote like this) take a little while to get used to, but provide a fantastic means of gleaning the inner workings of our anti-hero.Highly recommended."
"170",169,"Samuel Harrison","Raskolnikov believes he is among the elite qualified to administer justice outside the law and kills the greedy pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta. But his conscience gnaws at him as he struggles to hide his crime and tries to help the Marmeladov family, the daughter Sonya forced to be a prostitute to feed the family and the drunk father driven over by a carriage. When his sister Dounia tries to marry Luzhin to secure the family's finances, Raskolnikov dismisses the man. His fits of fever and delirium reflect his inner struggle. In the end he couldn't accept that he is a Napoleon fit to judge and punish the wicked.The detective Porfiry calls Raskolnikov to question about the crime and begins to suspect the man of murder but couldn't find the evidence. In the end, Sonya convinces Raskolnikov to confess. But even before going to jail, he conscience was punishing him for the crime because though he convinced himself that it is just to kill the pawnbroker, he isn't a psychopath or a sociopath and he feels the guilt of taking a life. Crime and Punishment is novel that probes the psychology of crime and its effect and futility of rationalization, even for justice's sake. "
"171",170,"Sandra Sawicka","A gloomy exploration of guilt and conscience set in even gloomier Russia. I suppose you need to be in the mood for that kind of literature, as it is pretty depressing. However, it is such a convincing portrayal of a criminal and written in thought-provoking, interesting way, that it is very much among my favourite classics."
"172",171,"Miranda","Even though I made it through high school and my second to last semester in grad school without having to read this book, I am so happy I it finally showed up on a syllabus. Once I started reading this novel, I was spellbound. I love Sonia and Raskolnikov. Truly this is a great love story (unconditional love???) that delves into the human psyche. Loved the ending. "
"173",172,"Hani Abdullah","Words fail to describe how dear I hold this great novel. I have heard its praises in song over and over prior to actually picking it up, and I can say without a doubt that it did not, in the least, disappoint. The author's show of the degradation of Raskolnikov's psyche and overall mental state, written in such a beautiful and expressive way, is what struck me with awe the most. Though reeking in a gloomy and depressive atmosphere, this is definitely a novel that I will give another read (an act foreign to me)."

"177",176,"Patrice Hollmann","A very, very powerful book. Interesting plotting and amazing characters. Rodion Raskolnikov is student who has no money but he's a very proud person. He commits murder becouse he sees himself as a 'Napoleon', higher on the ladder of humanity then others. He later starts the battle against the wole world around him: the detective, his freinds, his family. He becomes obsessed with his crime and sees it as a challenge for himself. Raskolnikov becomes self-centered and cold altrough he's still capable of being kind, warm and generous. Raskolnikov's sister Dunya is a lot like her brother. After being proposed by a wealthy man, Luzhin (who is actuallyvery mean and wants to marry a poor girl in order to have influence over her.) Dunya doesn't hesitate to accept the offer and to victimize herself to make the life of her brother easier. She's very strong, clever and can andure much pain as long as her loved ones are O.K. There is a clvere detective porfirii Petrovich who solves the mystery of the murder and knows that Raskolnikov is the one who committed it. There is a long and interesting psychological battle between the detective and the murderer, which Raskolnikov doesn't want to give up. He later meets a girl Sonya, the daughter of a drunk man, who has to help her family a mad, ill stepmother and two little kids. She leads a life of a prostitute to earn money but on the inside she's the only one who remains absolutely clean and saint-like. She falls in love with Raskolnikov and dispite him being cold and nasty, tries to help him. Raskolnikov tells her the truth and Sonya intends to help him. She convinces him to go to the detective and Raskolnikov, after many attempts does so.He's sent to prison but Sonya never leaves him alone. With her faith and kindness he starts to love her and wants to start a new life with her. Crime adn Punishment is the most interesting book I've read. Dostoyevsky is a real genious. There are many other characters I've not mentioned and their portrays are so real. I didn't want the book to end but was too fascinated to put it down. The characters develop as the story progresses ant the plot takes turns I've not mentioned. Every character is very human with her or his own problems. There is a small bridge border sanity and insanity in this book. It's very, very powerful and amazingly well-composed. Every feeling and every word in it seems real. I'd give the book millions and millions of stars if I could."
"178",177,"Justin Mathew","This is the best book that I have read so far. I just bow the author for the immense pain he had by living in his characters.

"183",182,"Vanita","Como é que posso dizer que gostei de um clássico russo sem soar a 1) snob, 2) pseudo-intelectual, 3) com a puta da mania ou, pior, 4) mentirosa? O problema com estes livros que são considerados obras-primas da literatura mundial é que vivem envoltos numa aura de mistério, como se fossem intocáveis ao comum dos mortais. Sobram mitos em volta dos grandes escritores e a convicção que se cria é a de as suas obras são tão difíceis e elaboradas que o melhor é passar ao largo, sob pena de se sofrer um derrame cerebral se ousarmos tocar-lhes. Um erro, senhores! Agora posso dizer, por experiência, que em vez de se perder tempo com dois, três ou quatro títulos assim-assim, que nos deixam com uma sensação desconfortável de balão meio cheio, mais vale dedicarmo-nos a um destes livros que, por alguma razão, geram consenso gigante há uma enormidade de anos. Nada disto é um bicho de sete cabeças, posso assegurar. Não são histórias de mastigar e deitar fora, não, não são. Mas por isso mesmo é que valem tanto a pena.Aqui o leitor terá sempre um papel activo. Ver-se-á obrigado a questionar, a usar a cabeça, a reflectir e a tomar partido. Ser-lhe-á exigida uma leitura activa, atenta e, por isso mesmo, acabará por se relacionar emocionalmente com ideias que, embora escritas há bem mais do século, se mantêm actuais, porque vão à essência do que é o ser humano. Foi o que se passou comigo, com este ""Crime e castigo"", que trazia debaixo de olho desde há muito. Sem querer ser 1) snob, 2) pseudo-intelectual, 3) com a puta da mania ou, pior, 4) mentirosa, digo-vos que este é um dos melhores livros que me passaram pelas mãos. Se não mesmo o melhor. Impossível, pelo menos para mim, não nos identificarmos com Raskolnikov e todo o turbilhão de sentimentos que o movem durante o tempo da acção que, neste livro, se passa mais na cabeça das personagens do que no espaço físico. É um livro febril, que se lê quase de rajada, tal o desconforto que causa. Lemos porque queremos acabar com o sofrimento que nos consome, porque precisamos de descansar mas, também, porque nos deixamos enredar pela trama de Dostoiévski. Ah, quem me dera poder dizê-lo sem soar tão mal! Porque o preconceito dos livros não se esgota na má literatura, também os bons livros captam olhares de soslaio. E este é um desses casos. O meu conselho? Esqueçam isso tudo. Se ainda não conhecem o drama de Raskolnikov e procuram uma história que vos arrebate do princípio ao fim, preparem-se: este pode ser o livro que procuram. Mas ficam desde já avisados, que é um caminho sem retorno e nem sequer vos prometo que vos vá deixar mais felizes. É possível, sim, que esta experiência vos leve a questionar o mundo que vos rodeia, o que, para mim, é sempre uma mais-valia. E sim, já sinto falta de Raskolnikov. Sim, sim, o criminoso. Sinto falta do criminoso."

Pevear and Volokhonsky have done a great job with this one. I look forward to reading their translations of the Idiot and Brothers K. Highly recommended. "
"188",187,"William","I'll be honest here: I am no genius; but, I do gravitate toward the classics because I think they're less likely to be a waste of my time. When I read this about a year ago I'd tried to read it once before and stopped about a quarter of the way. This time I pushed through that barrier and wow. Yes the story works on many levels but you're free to enjoy it as a thriller--which it is. I heartily recommend it. A real page turner."
"189",188,"Vivian Rose","Crime and Punishment is a compelling look at the human psyche. A master storyteller, Dostoyevsky provokes the reader to explore traditions and complex beliefs. Crime and Punishment is a classical masterpiece that may be revisited for its profound themes and spiritual revelations of mankind's suffering amid poverty and temptation."
"190",189,"Nels Mattson","Reading this book for the second time I really got a lot more out of it. Also, reading this book in the context of all of Dostoevsky's earlier work, especially Notes from Underground, shone a bright light on the inner meaning of the book. Although I feel like The Gambler was the dishwater leftover after Dostoevsky worked on Crime and Punishment every day, I hope it enhances my understanding of The Idiot like Notes from Underground helped with Crime and Punishment.At different points I was reminded of my two favorite books while reading this one: Ulysses and Lolita. I know Joyce was a fan of Dostoevsky but Nabokov openly mocked him. I can't help but think that Nabokov was just mad at himself for taking so much from him stylistically. I was reminded of Joyce because both authors created protagonists who were semi-autobiographical who held beliefs that ran counter to the author's beliefs. Dostoevsky has Raskolnikov and Joyce has Daedalus. As for the similarities to Lolita, the showdown with Svidrigailov was remarkably similar to Humbert Humbert's showdown with Clare Quilty. Nabokov often poked fun at Dostoevsky's pulpy over-dramatic plots involving murders and prostitutes, but Nabokov use the same type of plots, albeit under the guise of satirizing Dostoevsky. Reading this book I often had to pause to admire how elegantly it was designed. "

"194",193,"Esdaile","Who is not enthralled by the opening lines, describing Rashkonlikov's wish to avoid his landlady? This is the tale of the rootless urban student/intellectual per se and a Christian analysis of conscience and guilt also shows a very wry perception of how the argument ""the aim justifies the means"" is sinful and leads to disaster. Not only is much of Dostoyevsky's prescient about the forthcoming Communist distopia, he also had no illusions about America. The comic/gortesque element fo Dostoyevsky should not be overlooked, as in Svidrigailov's declaration that he is going to America as a description of impending suicide. An all time classic, nevertheless very easy to read."
"195",194,"Frank Deschain"," I wasn't expecting to get sucked into this book so quickly. My mom had gotten me a Barnes and Noble gift card, and on an Ambien-induced Christmas e-shopping spree on Christmas Eve Crime and Punishment ended up in my cart. I had heard vaguely about the story, but did not know too much. I always considered books like 1984, Brave New World, and The Great Gatsby as some of my favorite classics. I can now add Crime and Punishment to the list.  The book opens as Raskolnikov is in hardship as a struggling student. He has been pawning stuff to the local pawnbroker lady, and begins to ruminate on thoughts of murdering her. Through an entire 100 introductory pages he ruminates more and more until slowly and inevitably, he murders the pawnbroker and the sister, and quickly escapes the scene. It seems for awhile that he has committed the perfect crime. Except for the effects on his health. Always in a state of paranoia and high anxiety, he is unable to act normal for the rest of the novel. His mother and sister end up paying him a visit, and he can't bear to stand them. In his mind, he is justified in his murder because he has rid society of a selfish louse. He feels no guilt except for the effect on his closest family. There's a lot to get into this story, and I'm not going to get into it here. As I've read in other reviews, there are a few flaws. A tendency for melodrama, and a certain confusion with Russian names. Like Raskol Raskolnikov, Ivana Petrovich Petrovich Mushkin, etc. I of course exaggerate the names but it's about as confusing. Luckily this edition includes a handy character guide."

"198",197,"Raül De Tena","Ya se sabe que el lector (como el cinéfilo y muchas otras categorías de consumidor de cultura) funciona por comparación. Eso no significa que la comparativa se buena. Sólo que es, simple y llanamente, inevitable. En mi caso, la lectura de Crimen y castigo se ha visto completamente condicionada por el libro que estuvo antes entre mis manos: Vida y destino de Vassili Grossman. Mientras a Grossman no le perdonaba ciertos deslices de extensión injustificada, lo de Dostoievsky seguro que consta en los anales de la literatura como un ejemplo de depuración y transparencia.Lo primero que sorprende al abordar Crimen y castigo es descubrir que el estilo de Dostoievsky es mucho menos barroco y abigarrado de lo que podría esperarse de un autor de su época (increíblemente menos culterano y opaco que Grossman, más contemporáneo). A partir de ahí, todo es una delicia: la estructura de la novela, que podría aquejarse del formato ""serial"", es totalmente apasionante. Cada capítulo se resuelve como un átomo independiente del resto pero con poderosas fuerzas invisibles que los unen de forma adictiva y hacen avanzar el cuerpo total a un ritmo pausado, contemplativo, pero nunca aburrido.Los personajes, pese a deberle demasiado a las leyes de la dramaturgia clásica (la madre sufrida, la hermana dispuesta al sacrificio, el amigo de moralidad inquebrantable), muestran unas entrañas intrincadas y ponzoñosas que acaban por redondear sus caracteres (la madre que opta por la ceguera ante el drama del hijo, la hermana que elige el amor en contra de la facilidad, el amigo que vislumbra el drama en los ojos de Raskólnikov). Pero si hay un personaje que se lleva la palma, es precisamente Raskólnikov, un SER HUMANO en mayúsculas con toda la carga de contradicción que eso implica. Es Crimen y castigo no sólo el retrato genial del sentimiento de culpa (como suele decirse) sino, sobre todo, una disección pluscuamperfecta de las contradicciones de todo ser humano: el querer y no poder, el creerse mejor de lo que en realidad se es, el no poder sobrellevar el peso de las consecuencias de tus propias acciones... La dramática realidad de darse cuenta (muy a lo Herman Hesse) que no todos somos iguales y que la muerte de un inferior puede beneficiar a un superior.Aquí (y en muchos otros aspectos) entronca Crimen y Castigo con la maravillosa Los Miserables de Victor Hugo. Los puntos de contacto entre ambas obras son numerosos y evidentes (sentimiento de culpa, enfrentamiento contra el estado, personaje de policía como manifestación de la conciencia). Pero, sobre todo, si en algo se parecen las obras de Dostoievsky y Hugo es en la capacidad de ambos para tomarle el pulso a la cara menos amable de su época. Más allá de los personajes y la trama, Crimen y castigo se destapa como un retablo hiper-realista de la sociedad rusa de la segunda mitad del siglo XIX, con especial detallismo hacia las capas sociales menos favorecidas: prostitutas, borrachos y personajes que viven al borde de la indigencia se trenzan en una trama que extrae de estos substratos sociales la verdadera carne humana."

"205",204,"Logan Lee","Loved it and was challenged all the same. The last few lines offered a wonderful, fulfilling conclusion to a rather excruciating journey:""life had stepped into the place of theory...but that is the beginning of a new story-the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.""But ""assez cause'!"" read this book yourself!

"207",206,"Yvonne Bastian","Another brilliant book, after committing double murder, Raskolnikov takes the reader through an emotionally psychological roller coaster of turmoil, anguish and fear. It was thoroughly brilliant and really easy to get into and stay with to its conclusion. Russian works have a reputation for being hard reading, but i have read several Russian Classics and can definitely say that this is not true of a great many of them. I will be reading more by Dostoyevsky. "
"208",207,"Daniel Knox","I read this book very slowly, over the course of a few weeks. No other book has presented me with the concept of guilt in quite this way. It's like waking up from a bad dream in which you've killed someone, and for the rest of the day you have this inexplicable feeling of dread. That's the feeling of guilt this book left with me. Incredible read."

"210",209,"Sandy","I am surprised by how much I am enjoying it. My son recommended it to me and I kept putting it off due to the size and style of the writing....lots of run on sentences, as well as paragraphs. However, I love historical and period books, and never read Dostoevsky, so I finally jumped into it about six weeks ago. I really like it! When I got into it, I found it quite thrilling, actually. It's just not a quick ready, that's all."
"211",210,"Chair","‘ I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity.’In Dostoyevsky’s novels, I tumble head over heels in the swing between personal redemption and demise. I am always thinking that “crime” is part of human being; it is partly attached to our existence. No one can deny being dominated by the evils and the sins, even in a split second. We are all greedy when our current holdings can no longer satiate our aggrandizing appetites; we are all grumpy when things go beyond our controls and deviate from our expectations; we are all envious when rewards are bestowed to those who, in every aspect, perform far better than us. And once we are dominated by such “sins”, we might step further to commit crimes. As long as crimes are committed, what left unrealized is our “punishment”. There are many kinds of punishments, physical or mental. What matters is not the form of punishments, but the fact that punishments have already been taken. Here, I recall a well-known saying by Lu Xun, a notable writer in China, “Break out in silence or perish in it.” It is in fact true as we can derive from Raskonikov, the protagonist. In the endless, irresistible and oppressed silence of hiding his murder, Raskonikov can only escape being torn from inside and suffering from delirious state by admitting his crime (he eventually breaks out). Otherwise he may live in the abiding shadow of his crime and become insane (without self-surrender he would perish in the silence).But here, in this novel, “crime” and “punishment” are very different from our common conceptions. Raskonikov’s “crime” is not that he murders Alyona Ivanovna and her timid sister Lizaveta, but his arrogance in placing himself above his fellow men and thus is not bound by the rules of society. Likewise, the “punishment” is his deeply felt, unexpected from the standpoint of him, guilt over what he has done.Beyond doubt that Raskonikov is intelligent, but he is also exceedingly arrogant. As spoken by himself:‘To go wrong in one's own way is better then to go right in someone else's.’His perception about the world is much interesting, if we analyze it from the standpoint of Kant. Raskonikov’s fundamental character alienates him from human society. His pride and intellectualism lead him to disdain the rest of humanity as merely fit to perpetuate the species. In contrast, he believes his part of an elite “superman” class and can consequently transgress accepted moral standards for higher purposes, such as the total human well beings. Notably, it is a very utilitarian perspective. Raskonikov deems the sacrifice of others’ interests (even the unalienable rights of life, liberty and property) is necessary to fulfill the entire good of the majority. As opposed to him, Kant reasons that human are not instruments that can be used to maximize the utility of the society. And this is because, as Kant thinks, human are rational beings. It is such ability to reason that distinguishes us from other creatures in the world. (They don’t have the ability of reasoning to determine their own minds so that they cannot act freely in the intellectual world.) Therefore, we find a exceedingly sharp contrast between Raskonikov’s utilitarian recognition of the world and Kant’s libertarian approach to unveil the world. And I am personally inclined to accept Kant’s view because I regard human as respectable beings. We deserve dignity. Hence it is delightful for me to read that, in the end, Raskonikov’s realization of his love toward Sonya transcend his ingrained contempt of humanity.Raskonikov’s relationships with other character do much to illuminate his personality and understanding of himself. Although he cares about Razumikhin, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and Dunya, he is so constrained in his mean and skeptical outlook that he is often unappreciative of their attempts to help him. He turns to Sonya as a fellow transgressor of social norms, but he fails to recognize that her sin is much different from his: while she truly sacrifices herself for the sake of others, he essentially commits his crime for his own sake alone. Svidrigoliv is a very enigmatic guy in this novel and you can hardly find his traces and minds. Although he is a despicable and sneaky individual, Svidrigoliv possesses the ability to accept that he cannot conform the reality to meet his deepest desires. In this regard, he functions as a foil of Raskonikov, who only partially admit the idiosyncrasy of his idealized “superman” identity. After all, though Raskonikov regards himself as Napoleon, he eventually falls into the lines and rows of common people. It is nothing wrong or worthy of spite to be a common boy; it is okay for you to put much demand on yourself but not too many expectations.In crime and punishment, I have witnessed the redemption of Raskonikov and the suicide of Svidrigoliv. To me, this book bears this out: redemption or demise; break out or perish."
"212",211,"Roberto Gonzalez Mas","This book is one of the best books I've read in my life.Dostoyevsky describes people a lot in his books, so this tends to be tedious, but if you like Tolkien and Shakespeare and you´d never came to be tired with the Iliad, you'll love this book."
"213",212,"Vrixton Phillips","It's a wonderful, wonderful book. I love it from the first sentence of Part 1 all the way to the last page of Part 6.The epilogue, however, is something I take issue with.It's suddenly [and this starts becoming apparent somewhere in Part 5 or 4, I think] starts looking as if Dostoevsky is writing a long-winded religious tract that pretty much says ""life sucks, but with Jesus..."" But then again, I must confess I'm not a huge fan of the ""salvation"" part of stories. I'm more into pure tragedies like Oedipus. No salvation for Oedipus [at least not in Oedipus Rex,] just sorrow, tragedy, and blindness. That's my kinda thing. It's a fairly satisfying Epilogue all the same, though. I mean what a downer ""after about a year of suffering through hard labour, Raskolnikov was brutally murdered in the church by a convict"" would be, y'know? I suppose given the circumstances, he needs to be saved; there's no other way for the ending to be good.This is the second Dostoevsky book I've read that had a rather poor ending. Perfection on paper up until the very end, where it seems to fall apart. [I'm referring to his book [book:The Adolescent|5700]]But I wouldn't at ALL un-recommend this simply because of the ending. The story is exciting, the prose is wonderful, and there are some very quotable moments in it. I'm glad I read it outside of a class so that I can enjoy it, but I would love to take a Russian Lit class to look further into this marvelous work."
"214",213,"Nicolas","This is an absolute classic, and after reading this I understand why. The quality of Dostoievski's writing is like listening to Jimi Hendrix playing his guitar for hours. The way he gives us the story was wonderful (remember this with the chapter of the crime). Raskolnikov turned into my favorite character after this (he knocked Edmond Dantes out of the number one), the guilt eats him inside and he suffers immensely throughout the story - I won't say anymore, just read this book PLEASE!"
"215",214,"Dũng Nguyễn","Giả dụ như thế này: bạn là một người kiệt xuất, bạn biết rõ ràng rằng mình sẽ giúp đỡ được rất nhiều người khác, và rồi đưa cái thế giới này tới một đích đến tốt đẹp hơn nhường nào. NHƯNG, để thực hiện tất cả những việc ấy, bạn phải giết một con người - ý tôi là - một con rệp, một con rệp hút máu những người cùng khổ khác trong xã hội. Nếu bạn không thể đưa ra quyết định, hãy hỏi mình là liệu bậc thiên tài như Napoleon rơi vào trường hợp như vậy, ông sẽ làm gì ? Câu trả lời của Racolnikov là Napoleon sẽ làm, và sẽ không cảm thấy gì hết, vì đó là một việc đúng đắn. Vì đối với những vĩ nhân, thì những việc như vậy không đáng là điều phải bận tâm. Đó chỉ là một con rệp. Racolnikov đã làm như vậy, đã trù tính tất cả, đã hành quyết con rận ấy. Chỉ có điều, cuối cùng, tâm trí anh không thể gạt bỏ những suy nghĩ ban đầu sang một bên. Tội ác cuối cùng sẽ bị trừng phạt, cách này hay cách khác.Racolnikov, nhân vật chính của thiên tiểu thuyết này là một sinh viên đầy triển vọng, anh học luật, bất chấp cuộc sống thiếu thốn, anh có những suy nghĩ riêng, và đã có bài báo đầu tiên của mình. Bên cạnh đó, Racolnikov cũng là một người thấu hiểu những đau khổ của người khác: anh sẵn sàng giúp đỡ người khác đến đồng tiền cuối cùng của mình.Tội ác và hình phạt (Crime and punishment) được xây dựng rất chặt chẽ: nhân vật Xonia - người gái điếm, xuất hiện như một nhân vật phụ lúc đầu truyện, nhưng từng bước, từng bước, cô trở thành điểm nhấn và cứu cánh của Ralconikov. Xonia là người bất hạnh. Racolnikov đã quỳ xuống hôn chân cô, trước khi ""xưng tội"": như Racolnikov nói, không phải anh quỳ trước cô, mà quỳ trước nỗi đau đớn của loài người. Xonia, dù quê mùa và ngốc nghếch, nhưng cô là một người Cơ Đốc, ngược lại, Racolnikov là một kẻ vô thần. Đó là một đoạn rất hay, một kẻ vô thần, xưng tội với một cô gái điểm, xưng tội trước nỗi đau của nhân loại.Sau những biến cố trong truyện, bất chấp việc mình đã tự thú, chỉ để nguôi ngoai cảm giác thất bại, Racolnikov vẫn không hiểu tại sao mình bị dằn vặt và dày vò đến mức độ ấy, anh gần như hóa điên, anh lúc nào cũng ốm/sốt và không thể có một giấc ngủ bình thường. Anh tự thú vì nghĩ rằng, đó là vì mình đã phạm sai lầm trong tính toán, chứ không phải vì mình có lỗi. Anh không nghĩ rằng giết một con rệp là sai lầm. [Và tôi nghĩ rằng, chúng ta, nếu đặt vào vị trí của mình, cũng sẽ có nhiều người cùng quan điểm này] Anh đau đầu và dần trở nên điên loạn. Tù đày chỉ là hình thức, việc anh không lý giải được những điều dày vò tâm hồn anh mới là thứ đang níu lấy linh hồn của anh để kéo xuống, càng lúc càng nặng.Tiểu thuyết Nga nói chung, thường nói về bi kịch, điều này là dễ hiểu bởi các nhà văn Nga thường khai thác nỗi đau và các câu chuyện xảy ra trong xã hội của họ dưới chế độ Sa hoàng. Trong tội ác và chừng phạt, có đến 6 cái chết. Những trang cuối của truyện, tưởng chừng Racolnikov sẽ đi đến giới hạn chịu đựng của mình và chấm dứt cuộc sống của anh (điều này Racolnikov cũng đã nhiều lần nghĩ đến). Thế nhưng, Xonia, cô gái điếm đại diện cho nỗi đau - nhưng cũng đại diện cho tình thương của loài người, đã neo anh trở lại. Tình yêu đã cứu lấy Racolnikov, dù vẫn mù mờ không hiểu những gì xảy ra, nhưng cuộc sống của anh kể từ ngày ấy hồi sinh, bất chấp 7 năm phía trước tiếp tục ở trong ngục. Một cái kết có lỗi thoát, có chút nào lạc quan và nhân bản: tình yêu trở thành niềm an ủi, là thứ xóa đi mọi khoảng cách, đem con người đặt ngang bằng nhau, không có con người, không có con rệp, và dù tội ác có là thế nào, thì tình yêu vẫn là lý do để con người ta tiếp tục sống trên cuộc đời này. Tình yêu cứu rỗi nhân loại.Đối với mình, đây là một trong những tiểu thuyết tuyệt vời nhất từng đọc, tác giả phân tích tâm lý nhân vật quá tài tình, bên cạnh những tuyến nhân vật và tình huống truyện chặt chẽ, mọi thứ đều có một sợi dây liên kết với nhau và là người đọc hiểu rõ hơn những biến động điên loạn của nhân vật chính và của bối cảnh xã hội trong câu truyện. Chỉ có điều là 1/3 truyện lúc đầu khá khó đọc, đó là khi tác giả chuẩn bị nhiên liệu cho một bữa ăn thịnh soạn - qua đoạn chuẩn bị này - mình nhắc lại - đó là chắc chắn là một trong những bữa ăn sẽ ám ảnh bạn mãi mãi."
"216",215,"David Fleming","Reading Crime and Punishment was one of the most rewarding reading experiences I've yet undertaken. Sometimes reading the text can feel akin to drinking from a firehouse and he's been criticized for being a writer of melodrama and cliche. And yet that is what makes the book so interesting to me. It's fascinating to make the attempt to discover how Dostoyevsky manages to make us care and how he essentially pulls us through hundreds of pages through the trick of mystery and suspense. I could feel him toying with the lessons he learned from Victor Hugo while in prison, thinking to himself in a true Engineer's fashion, 'yeah, this will get them.'I think that this book is best explained by drawing parallels between hypnosis. Specifically, I'm referred to the fractionation technique of taking subjects in and out of deeper and deeper trances (comparable to his gradual increase in paragraph length), the dissociative technique of attributing key statements to others (comparable to the epistolary nature of the early books of the novel) and the response anticipation of making someone wait for key information (comparable to prolonged, repetitive discussions between Raskolnikov and the inspector and the general theme of waiting to be discovered). In summary, I believe from my reading of this, The Brother's and Notes that Dostoyevsky's prose style is that of a verbal hypnotist. One thing that stands out in my mind now that I'm reflecting back after several years is the dream with the beating of the horse and the man that kept saying, ""I own it, it's my property!"" And maybe this is a small complaint that I have: This dreams seems to be an allusion to an argument against capitalism and in favor of an impending political revolution but how can the theme of crime and punishment intermesh with a general political theme of that time such as anti-capitalism? It's also interesting how he made me care so much for Raskolnikov. This novel does an excellent job of describing the ideas behind ambition, even misguided, petty ambition. "
"217",216,"Yousef","Marvelous Masterpiece, assez causé! (as Dosty would exclaim)"
"218",217,"Maddyy Kendrick","You know, I'm not a great one for symbolism, actually I kind of suck at it, but this book had such obvious symbolism in it that it made me smile, because I actually got it =) It starts with Rodya's dreams really, doesn't it? The most obvious one to me was the dream about the poor mare who had to sacrifice herself for the men who were too impatient to wait. Not that it was a mare, not a stallion, and to me this sort of shows how women are usually sacrificing themselves for men, just as Rodya believes that Dunya is sacrificing herself for Rodya by marrying Luzhin. The dream is also brought up when Rodya talks to Marmeladov. He says that, Sonya, has to sell her body to earn a living for their entire family. The dream is also a pretty blatant warning for the impending murder. Then there was the cross which Sonya gave Rodya, and in a biblical manor, while going to the police station, he falls to his knees while carrying the cross, rather like Jesus did when he was made to carry his cross up the hill to his death and fell in the middle of the town square. Sonya funnily enough had carried the cross for him up until then that is which implies that in a biblical, Jesus-like way, she is suffering for him. Sonya and Lizaveta (Rodya's victim) had exchanged crosses and become spiritual sisters, and the cross was orginally Lizaveta's - so Sonya carries her 'sister's' cross, the cross of her friend and Rodya's innocent, carefree victim, whom poor old Rodya had never intended to murder. (Aha, there Tyrone, I wrote a review, a rather rushed one, but I still did it!)"

You will see how bad is it to lose your way, your goals about life. Raskolnikov is regretting about lots of things but also he knows what he regrets saves his life. So, he is confused and has lots of complicated questions about life. He is against to the system. It is a deep story, deep book, deep language. Dostoyevsky did an amazing job again."
"221",220,"Theleem","One of the most suspenseful and intriguing classics I've ever read.

"226",225,"Silvia Sirea","È un romanzo che legge e scava nell'animo umano in maniera delicata e prepotente al tempo stesso. Pone il lettore di fronte alle scelte compiute dal protagonista e ai suoi tormenti. Al termine della lettura rimane un senso di compiutezza."
"227",226,"Andrew Philip","Such a bracing exploration of self-aggrandizing psychosis. Raskolnikov is a pleasure to view from afar, because if I got close to him I'd feel wrong all over.

I suddenly realized, clear as day, that not a single soul had so far dared, and would not dare to bypass all this nonsense, simply take it all by the tail and shake the hell out of it! I... I wanted to dare, and I killed.... I only wanted to dare, Sonia-that's the whole reason!""Crime and Punishment explores the morality and consequences of crime. Does the end justify the means? Raskolnikov submerges himself in his own orchestrated turmoil and anguish over the murders he committed and by doing so, alienates himself from the people who care for him the most. Pride and ego-centrism rule over him throughout the story even as he is clearly overcome by guilt. In the end, it is the love that he so fervently pushed away that saves his wretched soul. I found myself unable to put the book down, especially when Dostoyevsky depicted Raskolnikov's internal turbulent anxiety as it manifested into his fits of delirium. It reminded me of the real feeling one gets while in the middle of a nightmare that feels freakishly palpable.Although a long read, it is a very engaging one. I highly recommend this classic!"
"230",229,"Shelley Zhao","One of my favorite books; a very interesting look into the psychology of a killer. Can be a bit dry and long, but work through it and you'll be richly rewarded.

"232",231,"Craig Kyle","The novel is set in St. Petersburg, Russia, in the mid-1860s. Meet the star of Crime and Punishment: a young, good looking ex-student, as he's coming out of his crummy little room. His name is Raskolnikov and he's thinking of doing something really, really bad, and even has a plan. He's talking to himself, and doesn't think he's really capable of doing the mysterious bad deed, and isn't even sure he wants to. Still, he's actually doing a practice run, as I speak.He gets to the pawnbroker's house. Her name is Alyona Ivanovna, and she's a mean old lady, who lives with her half-sister Lizaveta, who is mentally challenged and, unlike her sister, a very sweet person. Raskolnikov pawns his father's watch, and it becomes clear that the bad thing he wants to do is…murder. He wants to kill Alyona and steal her money. But he's not sure if he can, should, or will go through with it.On his way back home, he goes to a bar and meets Marmeladov, an unemployed drunk, and hears his sad story: Marmeladov is married to Katerina. Katerina has three young kids from a previous marriage, and Marmeladov has an eighteen-year-old daughter, Sonia, from his previous marriage. Since Marmeladov is a drunk, and money is tight, Katerina made Sonia start selling sex for money, and now Sonia lives by herself, because the other tenants in the Marmeladov's building didn't want a prostitute living there. Eventually, Raskolnikov takes Marmeladov home. Want to find out more? Well you’ll have to read the book for yourself. Trust me it’s creepy but definitely a page-turner. No worries, author Dostoevsky knows how to keep you intrigued."

"234",233,"Chas Ely","An excellent and entertaining analysis of the human mind, its emotions, and insanity. In this way it actually reminded me of Catch 22; I would frequently note to myself while reading that the overwhelming detail regarding the way every character ticks, thinks, and exists is phenomenal. This book is a classic and for good reason."
"235",234,"Alexander","Quite simply one of the greatest psychological studies in literature, im my humble opinion at any rate. I've read it only twice, but I'm sure if I live another twenty five years and don't go nuts, I'll get it read another half dozen times. I find it preferable to what many consider Dostoyevsky's masterpiece, The Brothers Karamazov, as I find there are sections that are completely unnecessary (such as the drawn out section with the gang of kids) Maybe I'm thick, and don't see the relevance. Anyone who can enlighten me, please let me know!"
"236",235,"Ahmed","I think this book is one the greatest books I have read so far. It depicts psychology in a way that is incredibly amazing. Moreover, It depicts sociology and how the structure of society affects the people who live in it.It Is an amazing book. The book changes how I look at things. It changes my perspective on specific things.Even though the story has its ups and downs, happy and sad moments but the end proves that confession can cure all feelings of guilt. The Ending is not what it is expected to be, not a shadow of a clue. I never expected to have a happy ending to such a mad and sad book. Rodya is mentally ill, I think ( which is obvious), and that his illness is schizophrenia. In simple words, he has two personalties. Sometimes, I admire him for being so intelligent and so heroic but other times I don't like him at all as he gets so delirium and so crazy. Sometimes, Rodya reminds of the Gollum in the book The Hobbit hehehehehe.Warning, the first 200 pages are very good but not WOW. The Stunning part is after the first 200 pages where it really astonishes me. IT begins with Part Three till the last word in the book. It is kind of detective novel but not based on clues and concrete evidence, rather on psychological analysis which I like the most as being interested in the filed."
"237",236,"Maarten","Overigens moet ik hierbij wel vermelden dat ik niet deze uitgave heb gelezen, maar een Nederlandse vertaling door Jan Meyer; een uitgave van de Russische Bibliotheek. En laat me bij deze zeggen dat het bij Russische Literatuur van niet te onderschatten belang is dat je een goede vertaling te pakken krijgt. Zo heb ik hier voor mij een ontzettende goedkope vertaling van 'De Dubbelganger' (ook Dostojevski) liggen die niet te lezen is. Het is alsof je met een volstrekt andere schrijver te maken hebt.Maar goed. Even nog kort over het boek: op de achterflap wordt het ""een van de beroemdste detectiveromans uit de wereldliteratuur"" genoemd, maar ik weet niet of ik het daar wel mee eens ben; de hoofdzaak van 'Misdaad en straf,' anders dan de titel doet vernoemen, is in mijn lezing niet zo zeer de misdaad en het oplossen daarvan, zoals dat bij detectiveromans meestal het geval is. Centraal staat eerder de psychologie van de moordenaar die uiterst fijnmazig wordt uitgeplozen; wij leren zijn karakter kennen en krijgen vanuit zijn eigen mond (en die van anderen) zijn theorieën uiteengezet die hem tot het doen van zijn daad hebben geleidt.Héél kort door de bocht heeft Raskolnikow een soort romantische theorie (hij wordt meerdere malen niet onwillekeurig een 'Schiller' genoemd) die de mensen in twee groepen verdeeld: de geniale wet-makende elite en het slaafse gepeupel, waarvan de elite een beduidend kleinere groep is die figuren zoals Napoleon (Raskolnikow zijn grote held) bevat. De geniale, wetmakende elite kan, gezien zij de groep zijn die de wetten maken, deze zelf niet werkelijk overtreden; bij het begaan van wat door het gepeupel als midaden wordt gezien, komt het niet eens in hun geniale ('of krankzinnige?' is de vraag die Dostojevski ons wil doen laten stellen; ziekte, koorts en waanbeelden zijn constant terugkerende motieven en thema's) geesten op dat wat zij doen verkeerd is. Zij zijn - om mij maar in eventjes onvermijdelijk in een Nietzschiaans vocabulaire uit te drukken - voorbij goed & kwaad.Raskolnikow wil graag tot deze elite behoren en besluit hierdoor een 'oude woekeraarster' waar niemand wat aan heeft en die iedereen alleen maar leed veroorzaakt over de kling te jagen als een soort test (Raskolnikow noemt het meerdere keren letterlijk 'een test'). Hij heeft prachtige morele rechtvaardigingen waarom de moord niet verkeerd zou zijn; rechtvaardigingen die hij overigens nooit los laat. Er gaan echter iets flink verkeerd: Raskolnikow wordt gedwongen een onschuldige bijstander te vermoorden en zijn geweten begint hem te parten te spelen. Wij worden door Dostojevski in Raskolnikows geest uitgenodigd terwijl hij aan zichzelf probeert te bewijzen dat hij tot de genialen behoort; tot zijn grote ergernis echter bewijst hij zichzelf echter het tegendeel en blijkt hij toch tot de niet-geniale kudden te behoren. Interessant is dat zelfs wanneer hij zich uiteindelijk aangeeft en hij zich dus gerechtelijk onderwerpt aan de rechtvaardigheid van de kudde, hij nog steeds innerlijk vasthoudt aan zijn heersersmoraal; slechts in het epiloog treedt hij tot de kudde toe en wordt hij herboren. Hoe? Nou, niet door zichzelf te overtuigen met allerlei ingewikkelde morele en wetenschappelijke bewijsvoeringen en gevolgtrekkingen, maar door de Liefde, natuurlijk, met een hoofdletter. “En wat waren het eigenlijk allemaal, al die angsten van het verleden! Alles, zelf zijn misdaad, zelfs het vonnis en de verbanning leken hem nu in de eerste opwelling iets uiterlijks, iets vreemds, zelfs bijna een feit dat niet met hem gebeurd was. Hij was […] niet in staat alnge tijd bij voortduring over iets bepaalds na te denken of zijn gedachten op iets te concentreren; hij zou op dit ogenblik ook geen bewuste beslissingen kunnen nemen; hij voelde alleen maar. Het leven was in plaats gekomen van de dialectiek, en in zijn bewustzijn moest hij nu iets geheel anders uitwerken.”En ja, dat vind ik mooi gezegd, dat van het leven dat in de plaats van de dialectiek is gekomen. Door de liefde. Raskolnikow is een karakter dat mij waarschijnlijk nog lang bij zal blijven, mede omdat ik mijzelf in bepaalde aspecten van zijn karakter herken; met name de neiging om maar te blijven malen in 'de dialectiek' en soms vergeten te leven. Na het lezen van 'Misdaad en straf' heb ik, net als bij het lezen van 'De gebroeders Karamazov', wederom het gevoel alsof Dostojewski mij een een waardevolle levensles heeft geleerd. Bedankt, Fjodor! En: tot de volgende keer."

"242",241,"Nana Fredua-Agyeman","Crime and Punishment (485; 1866)* by Fyodor Dostoevsky is the first book I have read by the author and the third by a Russian. It contributes towards fulfilling the Year of Russian Literature objective. A lot has been said about how great this book is; it is on almost every 'Best Books' list including my reading challenge list - the Hundred Books to be Read in Five Years. It has been reviewed so much that there possibly is nothing more to add. However, like Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, and all my reviews here on this blog, I will attempt to put down how I understood the book; not how it has generally been received.Crime and Punishment introduced me to the oft-quoted statement or insinuation that the Russians are 'the world's hardest writers'. Perhaps one could also include the Germans. In C&P, Dostoevsky takes the reader on a mental or psychological tour of the thought-processes, the minutest details, of decision-making; of creating or establishing reasons to influence, positively or negatively, responsibility-taking; of the arduous workings of the conscience and how guilt or otherwise is established, psychologically; and how the latter could have physical effects on the victim or the perpetrator.continue http://freduagyeman.blogspot.com/2013..."

"248",247,"Craig","Raskolnikov, a St. Petersburg (Russia) university drop-out commits perhaps literature's most famous crime. Thereafter, the perpetrator engages in a psychological cat-and-mouse game with a cunning and adept detective assigned to the case. There are many other sub-plots. Totally self-absorbed, Raskolnikov wanders through endless mental analysis and self justification, while at the same time, doing much good to those within his circle. He is, therefore, a bit of an enigma. Dostoyevsky paints his protagonist not so much as a wicked (black-hearted, immoral) person, but rather as a disturbed (amoral) one. In his many mind games, Raskolnikov asks a cogent question: How can Napoleon bring fame and emulation to himself by killing millions, while he (Raskolnikov) is judged and castigated for doing the same thing on a much smaller scale? Do great men have license to forge their own moral codes? Though Raskolnikov never quite feels guilt for his dastardly act, he willingly submits to a punishment imposed by his society. Ultimately, there is redemption. This is a great philosophical/psychological novel which poses many probing personal/societal questions. My only complaint with Dostoyevsky in Crime and Punishment (which I also had with his novel The Idiot), is that the author engages in excessive tiresome (sometimes mindless) dialogue between his characters, much of which is off-track and (I think) needless. Nevertheless, this is a great novel and a very engaging read. "

"252",251,"Izzy","Just read C&P for the second time. Rereading this masterpiece and analyzing it even more deeply has truly brought it to life for me. It's dark plot and characters are initially very depressing and give the novel a downtrodden and at times hopeless aura; however Dostoevsky provides a message behind these unfortunates that trumps their greatest vices. There is always freedom to change. No matter how terrible and unspeakable your sins, no matter who you are or who you have been you can transcend it. For me, this is the ultimate message of hope, and Dostoevsky nails it through his characters an storyline. "

"256",255,"Milo","This has got to be one of the darkest books I have every read. It's scary and disturbing but don't let that dissuade you from reading it. Dostoyevsky is one of those authors who flawlessly captures the characters thoughts and mental state on paper. Dostoyevsky easily ranks among the titan's of Russian literature for the simple way the suspense is allowed to build up and how Raskolnikov changes throughout the story. Raskolnikov's moral state is akin to ethical nihilism; the effect of his over-reasoning the situation. Moral's hold no ground when put up against soulless reason and so he commits crimes he knows are wrong but cannot understand why. This is not a light read but I would recommend it to anyone over fifteen years of age who is mature enough to handle some pretty graphic content."

"258",257,"Emily May","I've come to the conclusion that Russian door-stoppers might just be where it's at. ""It"" here meaning general awesomeness that combines the elements of history, philosophy and high readability to make books that are both thought-provoking and enjoyable. Granted, I have only read three of the Russian big-uns: War and Peace, Anna Karenina, and now Crime and Punishment, but I intend to rectify this shortly with The Brothers Karamazov and The Idiot. Now, I don't want to go blazing with too much excitement into the land of Tsars and vodka, and then just ending up with a load of disappointment like I got from some of the Aussie authors I was counting on this year, but I have honestly liked every Russian novel I've read so far, big and small.This may seem like a very odd comparison to make, but Crime and Punishment has made me feel much more ready to write my review of Stormdancer. One of my main points I wanted to make about the Japanese steampunk was to do with the massive overload of Japanese words that had me pulling up google every few minutes and resulted in a loss of excitement and appreciation for the story. But I was reluctant to say ""this book is too Japanese"" because I sound exactly like a typical silly uncultured westerner who isn't interested in learning about other ways of life. However, Crime and Punishment really proves that it isn't me being deliberately ignorant.I knew only what I'd got from Tolstoy about nineteenth century Russian society and people when I started this book, about as much as I knew about Japan from reading Manga when I started Stormdancer. The difference is that Dostoyevsky took me on an educational - but also gripping - journey around the backstreets and drinking dens of St Petersburg that told me about the nitty gritty details of life in Russia for those less fortunate - drunks, prostitutes, the poor - and I felt I had a very vivid portrait of this time and culture without once having to use google. I had a recent comment on one of my reviews basically saying I owed it to the author to do a little research before I comment on the novel, that it wasn't the author's responsibility to provide all the information. Look, in the end, I prefer a book that can stand up on its own without requiring additional material to have it make sense, I just do. And Crime and Punishment delivers that. It's educational without feeling like one lengthy info-dump, and it's philosophical without being a mindfuck.Raskolnikov is a great protagonist, he really is. His head is all over the place and he constantly struggles with what he believes in, his conscience and his desire to get what he wants. The reader is pulled so deep inside the dark depths of his mind that it's hard to avoid becoming completely absorbed in the story. He is at times nasty, at others funny, and at others pitiful. Dostoyevsky has created one extremely well-rounded and complex character. Crime and Punishment shows the human capacity for evil, but also for shame and remorse. And this latter is the real ""punishment"" for Raskolnikov when he is driven near to insanity by his guilt.I don't really know how best to fully articulate my feelings for Crime and Punishment. I don't give many five star ratings and I rarely feel this strongly about what I've read. I actually had a bloody dream about it! Speaking of dreams, I want to use this one example of Dostoyevsky's ability to engage the reader so thoroughly: I read one particular scene in the book that made me seriously distressed, I was furious, on the verge of tears, I was like a child who wants to jump inside the TV and make everything better... and then Raskolnikov awakes to discover it was just a dream. I swear that my sigh of relief fully eclipsed his! But that's how far into this story I became, how much I really cared about it. That doesn't happen often."
"259",258,"Angela","Dark, brooding, and cold, this Russian masterpiece rationalizes the mind and intent of a killer. Sweeping you into the guilt-ridden complexities of human nature gone awry, Dostoevsky will have you cringing and creeping through your days as you try to detach yourself from the labyrinth-esque paths of both mind and soul. Chilling and phenomenal. "

"265",264,"Keith Kendall","I started this book because a son was reading it before the school year started. He finished it when I had just barely started, and my reading languished as I read other books in my queue. Part of my delay was some debate over which translation to read.  Once I got going again in it, I found it very interesting, and lost all fear that I was reading the ""wrong"" translation.There are so many classics that I have not read & until now, this was one of them. Reading a summary of a book just doesn't convey the depth of thought and feeling found in the original, although I did find the character summary (included in the Kindle version) useful in keeping track of who was who. I am delighted that the translation was good enough that I forgot that I was reading a translation.I think I need to start a Russian shelf."
"266",265,"Holly","This book was very intense. In fact, I had to stop reading it before I went to sleep because of the anxiety and tension on each page. I read, by a professor of Russian lit that Dostoevsky was nothing but a good mystery writer, that once you've read his books all the tension and power is removed from the experience upon a second reading. I don't think I am qualified to argue with that statement but I feel such a statement ignores the psychological/spiritual reflection his books force on a reader. Dostoevsky was a spiritually tormented man, hungering for righteousness, and thirsting for Godly truth...all the while, seriously neglecting and mistreating his own family. "
"267",266,"Tanay","I read this in high school "
"268",267,"Christian","This book is excellent, a good read for those who have not yet got into Dostoevsky. A great psycological thriller that follows the downfall of a young man caught up in the idealism and social theories of the day. Amazingly vivid and lucid scenes full of emotion. As always Dostoevsky takes you deep into the heart of mankind to see what we really are made of. Like his other novels, Crime and Punishment debates the changing philosophical ideas of the era. Socialism, Nihilism, Utilitarianism, and Existentialism are all portrayed in major characters. The anti-hero character Raskilnikov serves as the main thread of the story unlike other Dostoevsky novels were there are many main threads. The question here is if this anti-hero can be saved from his damnation, from his own pride, and can a man be forgiven?"
"269",268,"Noel Kus","This is a thriller. You won't put it down before you finish it but it also leaves your emotions, sympathies and empathies all over the place. A must read especially for lovers of Dambudzo Marechera."
"270",269,"Caterina","If Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky himself suddenly were to rise from his grave and stand before me, I would bow and kiss his feet with delight and happiness, and thank him for writing Crime and Punishment. And then I would say, ""but I was never able to believe that generous and noble-souled young man would - or even could - kill that old woman."" One might think that the reader's incredulity about a major premise would seriously damage the novel. Instead, this tension of doubt seems to have made the novel more powerful - and Raskolnikov's psychological punishment is all the more spot-on believable. This is my all-time favorite novel. Tense, dense, crazily interwoven, satirical, excruciating in its scenes of guilt, cruelty, shame, and all manner of human misery - yet at times extremely funny - above all, Crime and Punishment is saturated with deep love for human beings in all our particulars. Here was an author who knew the lot of humans - illness, poverty, addiction, obsession, difficult relationships, sin & suffering - and also kindness, generosity, integrity, inner strength, forbearance, forgiveness, sacrificial love. The character development is wonderfully complex. My overwhelming impression: this book sets out to marry - and to invite us to believe in the marriage- of opposites at odds with one another - woman and man, head and heart, unbeliever and believer - without either of them losing their individuality, their integrity, or even, fully, their disagreement with one other. It challenges me, personally, to love radically, and gives me hope for the possibility of reconciliation where none seems possible."
"271",270,"Albert","Long on my to-read list (as almost all of the Russian literary cannon is), Dostoevsky definitely delivers. The psychology and philosophical argument behind Raskolnikov's crime is complex, but somehow the story unfolds in a very clear and straightforward manner. There is definitely something dated and something inherently Russian about this novel, but I don't think it suffers as a result."

"279",278,"Tihomir Rachev","Една от най-завладяващите книги, които някога съм чел! Наистина не очаквах да ми хареса толкова много. Трудно ми е да възприема, че това е роман, писан през 1860-те. Идеите в него са толкова философски, страхувам се, че на места не съм ги разбрал напълно. Психологизмът, с който са разкрити героите и най-вече Разколников, е потресаващо реалистичен. Диалогът и монологът - майсторски и ненатрапчиво разгърнати. Толкова бях впечатлен, че докато четях, често се спирах и си казвах: ""Като истинско е!"", защото и думите, и реакциите, и всичко ми се струваше точно такова, каквото би било в реалния живот (и то в наши дни!). Особено бях впечален от техниката на писателя при предаването на пияна реч и бълнуване - забелязах много типичните за тези състояния бъбривост, неточности, прекалена искреност. От друга страна, сериозно се дразнех, когато пасажите ставаха прекалено дълги и неразбираеми, а още повече от това, че всяка сцена беше разговор зад затворени врати. Успокоявах се с очакването на поредната мъдра теория или шокиращ момент. Истината е, че не прочеотх с нужното внимание всички диалози между героите, може би защото твърде често не проумявах какво точно имаха предвид (а те винаги целяха да изложат някаква своя позиция по даден въпрос). Винаги обаче с нетърпение четях всичко, което казваше или мислеше Разколников. Този герой поддържаше интереса ми през цялото време, тъй като едновременно го разбирах и му симпатизирах, но и го обвинявах и като характер оставаше непроницаем за мен. Много противоречива личност и все пак - толкова истинска. Ако другите герои докрая бяха малко плоски в ролите си на благодетели, то той имаше в себе си по-малко от целия спектър на емоционалността. Разколников мразеше, обичаше, колебаеше се, бе решителен, разкайваше се, после показваше пълен непукизъм, но тези състояние се сменяха по един естествен и логичен начин. Той не е скучен, защото не е праволинеен и мотивацията му често не може да бъде обяснена, мислите му често си противоречат, реакциите му понякога са прибързан - точно като истинско човешко същество. И Достоевски със сигурност е харесал именно тази ярка възможност за психологизиране у Разколников, за да го постави в центъра на романа си (който е заплануван като роман за вредните последствия от пиянството - впоследствие двете идеи се преплитат).Романът започна изключително интригуващо за мен. Веднага ми стана ясно, че трябва да очаквам убийство и с нетърпение прелиствах страниците, за да достигна до тази част. Страшно ми направиха впечатление душевнтие терзания на Разколников - да го направи или да не го направи. В съзнанието ми веднага изниква съня, в който пияният човек убива коня си, след което Разколников осъзнава, че той никога не би могъл да стори такова нещо с живо същество. Само че, типично за човешката душа, постепенно героят се поддава на вътрешен комромис и бърза да извърши замисленото. На този етап читателят си няма идея защо ще се случва това убийство. Някои елементи като че ли насочват към социални причини, липса на средства, дълбоката бедност (впрочем това също е една от основните теми на романа - картината на мизерията в Русия по това време, отъждествена до голяма степен с нравствената нищета). Разколников се успокоява с това, че старицата всъщност е никому непотребна социална потисничка. Чак по-късно става ясна пълната мотивация за престъплението. Поне така както го разбирам аз Разколников се отъждествява с Наполеон, тоест има се за велика личност. Героят развива собствена теория, че хората се делят на ""материал"" и ""въшки"", като първите имат правото и задължението да властват над вторите. Изключителните личности имат способности, които им дават достъп до гениални идеи в полза на обикновените хора. И според Разколников в името на тези идеи всички средства са оправдани. Той се основаа на примери от историята на човчеството - убийствата не са се смятали за немислим акт по времето на Древен Рим, по времето на Наполеон и т.н., защото са довели до големи промени. И Нютюн например е можел, ако срещне съпротива да прокара своите открития, да убие без последствия и т.н. След своето престъпление обаче Разколников горчиво осъзана, че той не е е изключителна личност. Причините, които дава:""Или че ако си задавам въпроса: въшка ли е човекът - това значи, че вече човекът не е въшна за мене, а е въшка за този, на когото това и през ум не му минава и който се решава направо, без въпроси... И щом толкова дни се измъчих за това - би ли се решил Наполеон, или не, - значи, ясно съм чувствувал, че не съм Наполеон...""Само дето на мен лично много ми беше чудно за какво точно му е тази власт на Разколников, какво точно иска да прави. Той самият не изповядва някакви възгледи да промени света, макар че в края на романа споменава, че бил искал да направи много добри постъпки. На мен много по-праводоподобно ми звучаха едни други негови думи:""Аз исках да се осмеля - и убих... аз поисках само да се осмеля, Соня, ето цялата причина!""Разколнико постоянно се вижда като по-различен от останалите, постоянно превижда за себе си някаква власт, която определя крайните му действия по време на романа: ""И аз сега зная, че който има здрав и силен ум и дух, той и властвува над тях! Койо се решава на много, той за тях е прав. Който е способен на повече неща да плюе, той за тях е и законодател, а който посмее повече от всички, той е най-правият! Така е било досега, така ще бъде и занапред""И той наистина е много умен, наистина плюе на всичко - и на учене, и на приятели, и на семейство, но като че ли губи от поглед крайната цел. Много късно осъзнава, че начинът да промениш живота е именно чрез силата на любовта и наивната надежда, чрез вярата в Бог, а не чрез омразата и радикалността. Такова е внушението на Достоевски, затова и така завършва романа. И другите герои бяха много интересни. Откроява се Разумихин - една страшно енергична и правдива личност, нещо като коренната противоположност на Разколников. Това е фигурата на истинският приятел, на истинският възлюбен, на истинският роднина и студент, който не чувства нужда да надскача собственото си съществуване. Чрез своята откровена самоотверженост, готовност да помогне въпреки обстоятелствата, чрез интелигентността и вярата си той е истинската изклчителна личност в книгата.Порфирий! Обожавам го, истинско удоволствие бяха сцените с него. Как само всяка негова дума звучеше мистериозно, иронично, объркващо. Неговите разисквания са една от най-психологичните части от романа, защото анализират действията на човека убиец. Това е историята за това как съдбата винаги успява да ни застигне. ""- А щом е така, то нима вие самият бихте се решили - да речем, поради житейски някакви неуспехи и лишения или за да помогнете някак на цялото човечество - да прекрачите препятствието?... Напримр да убиете и ограбите?..И някак изведнъж пак му смигна...""Подобни моменти ми носеха абсолютно задоволство. Като истински следовател Порфирий започваше да говори за нещо от ежедневието, после преминаваше към проблема, за да вмъкне тънък намек към Разколников - и с такъв плавен и неочакван преход! А самият ""обвиняем"" така пелтчеше и се изчервяваше - можех почти да се почувствам на негово място. ... ще излъже отлично, по най-хитър начин; би казал човек, че вече може и да триумфира, и да се наслаждав на плодовете на своето остроумие, а той - хоп! - на най-интересното, на най-скандалното място вземе, че припадне. Вярно е, че е болен и в стаите понякога е задушно, но в се пак! Все пак дал е повод да се помисли! Излъгал е чудесно, а с характера си не е съумял да се съобрази. Ето къде е то, коварството! Друг път, увличайки се от живото си остроумие, започва да си играе с този, който го подозира, пребледнее сякаш нарочно, сякаш на шега, но прекалено естествено, прекалено много прилича на истина...""Друг интересен герой е Свидригайлов. Отново сложна личност, защото у него се преплитат добро и зло. От една страна, той е развратник, конформист, убиец, но от друга, може и истински да обича, да прояви състрадателност. В началото не харесвах героя, струваше ми се прекалено типажен, но с всеки следващ негов диалог се убеждавах колко интересен е:""Е, та какво от това, нека да е развратът! Като са казали - разврат! Поне обичам откровените въпроси. В този разврат има поне нещо постоянно, почиващо дори на природата и неподчинено на фантазията, нещо, което винаги се намира в кръвта като пламтящо въгленче, което запалва, което още дълго време, и с годиние може би няма така скоро да угасиш. Съгласете се сам, че нима това не е в своя род занимание?""Достоевски не е моралист спрямо своите герои - той не проявяа пристрастие към тяхното мнение, оставя ги да имат собствени позиции, независмо колко странни, налудничиви, долни. Защото такива са хората понякога. Понякога менят мнението си, понякога се колебаят, представят се и си мислят, че са прави, но всъщност зад думите им прозира истината. И Достоевски ни оставя да видим всичко това сами. Много впечатляващи са женските образи в този роман. Соня и Авдотя са израз на феминистката позиция на писателя, тъй като те са до голяма степен еманципирани героини за историческия период, който представляват. Това е време на отмиране на патриархата, на модернизация в Русия - процеси, които неотменно влияят и на мястото на жената в обществото. Жените в този роман не са домакини, те не са в сянката на някакви силни мъжки фигури, а напротив - открояват се, действат самостоятелно и спрямо собствените си убеждения, което е огромна стъпка за тогавашната литература. Малко и за пиянството в романа, тъй като то е ключова сюжетна линия. Мермеладов, Иля Петрович, Свидригайлов, пияната девойка на улицата и др. са израз на авторовия укор към този порок. Пиянството унищожава младостта, семейството, авторитета на държавния служител, дори вреди на личността. Причините според Достоевски се коренят в дълбоката морална криза, настъпила в обществото, която прави подобни пороци приемливи и даже забавни, необходимо зрелище.Всичкия този реализъм и психологизъм на Достоевски прави ""Престъпление и наказание"" едно страхотно четиво. Въпреки дългите разговори, читателят продължава да чете, тъй като иска да проследи историята на Разколников - какво е неговото наказание? И накрая отговорът е даден - страданието. Страданието е тази монументална концепция, която Достоевски (заедно с Толстой) въвеждат в световната литература. Чрез него човекът не само изкупува вината си, но и се издига нравствено, постига истинското щастие. Множество теми и идеи се преплитат в сложния микросвят на ""Престъпление и наказание"". Сблъскват се характери и интереси. Сякаш Достоевски издига в култ важността на личния избор как да живеем живота си."

"287",286,"Ruthanne Davis","Murder...torment...retribution...resurrection. These are the themes of Dostoyevsky's CRIME AND PUNISHMENT. And this is a book I have avoided reading for decades, fearing it would be dull and difficult to comprehend. I was wrong! This is a magnificent epic of life prior to the Russian Revolution and one man's mistake. The descriptions of life in Russia at that time are precise and heart-wrenching. The poverty, the squalor, the inability to rise above your standing in life and, worst of all, the descriptions of starving children being forced to ""dance"" for a few rubles so their parents and siblings won't starve. It's a bleak situation and yet the narrative and characters are often amusing and always fascinating, despite their lot.I listened to the audio book version and Anthony Heald, the narrator on this particular version, was absolutely superb. If there were Oscars for book narration, he should have received one for this. He did every character, including the female ones, and you never had to guess who was speaking the dialogue because he adapted his voice so smoothly from one character to another. Simply outstanding!

"289",288,"*Rigel","Un arscin di spazioIl 23 Aprile 1849 la polizia dello zar Nicola I arresta a San Pietroburgo trentaquattro membri del circolo Petracevskij. L’accusa: attività sovversiva e cospirazione. Fra i nomi degli arrestati figura anche quello di Fëdor Michajlovič Dostoevskij, che afferma di aver frequentato il circolo, ma per motivi connessi alla sua attività di scrittore. Tanto basta all’ottuso regime per considerare il prigioniero particolarmente pericoloso al punto che fra le ventuno condanne a morte pronunciate dal tribunale c’è anche quella di Dostoevskij. La sentenza, grazie alla benevolenza dello zar, sarà commutata in quattro anni di lavori forzati nella fortezza di Omsk in Siberia e nel successivo arruolamento forzato nell’esercito come soldato semplice.Il “bagno penale” è un’esperienza che segna profondamente lo spirito di Dostoevskij, in particolare la condizione di trovarsi, lui nobile, in mezzo a comuni delinquenti, per la maggioranza di bassa lega sociale e di scarsa cultura. Ma l’abisso culturale che divideva lo scrittore dagli altri prigionieri era assai più profondo: Dostoevskij era proiettato verso l’occidente, padrone di idee completamente nuove e rivoluzionare, mentre nell’esilio entra in contatto per la prima volta con l’anima popolare russa, in modo inappellabile, diretto e profondo. Questa “convivenza forzata” sarà per lui fonte di arricchimento, condizione che gli consentirà di descrivere meglio i personaggi delle sue opere successive.L’esperienza dell’esilio e della reclusione è facilmente individuabile come la radice, il quid pluris che portò alla nascita di una delle maggiori opere dostoevskiane, Delitto e Castigo, o più correttamente Il Delitto e la Pena, in cui si legge un diretto riferimento alla celeberrima opera di Cesare Beccaria. Questo errore di trasposizione deriva dai curiosi natali della prima traduzione italiana del 1889, che fu fatta non utilizzando il testo russo, ma quello della traduzione francese di cinque anni prima, il cui titolo era Le Crime e le Châtiment. Il traduttore francese Derèly, non avendo colto il riferimento al titolo di Beccaria, scelse il termine châtiment per la traduzione del russo nakàzanie, che equivaleva sia per “castigo” che per “pena”. Ma se per il francese può valere questa ambivalenza terminologica, la stessa cosa non si può dire per l’italiano.Il fatto potrebbe apparire irrilevante, ma non è proprio così. Il tema cardine del romanzo Il Delitto e la Pena è infatti il passaggio dalla pena al castigo, come affermato dallo stesso Dostoevskij in una lettera del 1865.Molti scelgono quest’opera come primo approccio alla letteratura russa che, per un assurdo pregiudizio, viene considerata come ostica e arida; in poche parole: una vera e propria prova di coraggio per lo sprovveduto lettore. Ma al lettore, novello o veterano che sia, è consigliabile spogliarsi di ogni altro ricordo letterario, evitare di affrontare il testo cercando di improvvisarsi psicologo o sociologo e tentare di mettersi nei panni dei pietroburghesi che nell’autunno del 1865 lessero per la prima volta il primo capitolo di Delitto e Castigo.Proprio un fatto di cronaca dell’epoca spinge Dostoevskij a una riscrittura della prima bozza del suo romanzo, mettendo i propri lettori davanti a un fatto realmente accaduto qualche tempo prima: l’uccisione di un usuraio in tempo di crisi economica. A questo dato viene poi fornito uno spessore che non è solo mera cronaca criminale, ma assume le sembianze di un indagine sociale, il ritratto di una città e dei suoi abitanti, “atto di accusa e indicazione di riscatto”. Al centro di tutto questo si trova il personaggio dello studente assassino, i suoi moventi, la sua reale pena, interiore e esteriore, l’isolamento dagli affetti, la lacerazione della coscienza, il conflitto psicologico.Commettere un omicidio efferato e far finta che non sia successo niente? Rimuovere totalmente l’accaduto o incominciare un’inevitabile analisi dei motivi che hanno spinto al delitto, scandagliando e sminuzzando il proprio spirito? Infatti, solo attraversando di nuovo l’inferno si può tentare di intravedere una via d’uscita, una rinascita, si può ritornare “a rivedere le stelle”. E’ proprio questo isolamento, questa convivenza forzata con la propria coscienza e la consapevolezza dell’impossibilità di vivere senza il contatto con gli altri, che spinge infine Rodion Raskolnikov, il protagonista, alla sua confessione.Delitto e Castigo è interprete di un nuovo modo di raccontare: Dostoevskij utilizza la terza persona, guidando l’evolversi delle vicende, ma lasciando la parola solo ed esclusivamente ai suoi protagonisti, rendendo loro giustizia, dotandoli di vita propria. Il risultato è un romanzo polifonico, di straordinario realismo, violento nel suo impatto emotivo.I personaggi principali sono essenzialmente due: Raskolnikov, mente brillante, ex-studente costretto a vivere nell’indigenza e assassino, e Sonja, ragazza dallo spirito puro costretta a prostituirsi per mantenere la propria famiglia in miseria. Le vittime, una vecchia e maligna usuraia e sua sorella Lizaveta, morta per pura e sfortunata coincidenza, sbiadiscono di fronte al loro uccisore, diventano pallide e insignificanti, dei “pidocchi” come vengono descritte dallo stesso Raskolnikov.Pier Paolo Pasolini individuò in Raskolnikov l’embrione dell’idea del superuomo che Nietzsche elaborerà nel 1881, anno in cui Dostoevskij muore, ma quest’ultimo sconfesserà quello che l’altro esalterà.In questa ottica appare chiara la scelta di uccidere; Raskolnikov, infatti, spiega come il mondo sembrerebbe essere diviso in due categorie inalienabili: gli uomini ordinari e quelli straordinari. Nel primo caso si identifica la maggior parte dell’umanità, il cui unico scopo è vivere e procreare, mentre della seconda categoria farebbero parte tutte le menti illuminati, i grandi pensatori e i grandi condottieri, la cui coscienza rende lecito qualsiasi delitto essi possano compiere, a patto che i moventi siano nobili. Infatti a un esimio scienziato come Newton sarebbe stato perdonato il sacrificio di qualche vita, se questo fosse stato determinante per la diffusione delle proprie conoscenze, indispensabili all’umanità intera.Raskolnikov, dal canto suo, si sente un dominatore, aspirante a napoleoniche imprese, e per questo può uccidere una vecchia che presta denaro per usura. Da questo denaro egli potrà sostenere grandi progetti, risolvendo non solo i propri problemi, ma quelli di molte altre persone meritevoli. Inizialmente, quindi, crede di compiere un gesto nobile: uccidere la vecchia sarà semplice e non sarà un peso per la coscienza, in quanto un superuomo è fornito di attitudini naturali atte a scavalcare questo “patetico ostacolo”.Invece, pur avendo compiuto un delitto perfetto grazie anche all’assistenza della fortuna, pian piano desidererà inconsciamente di essere smascherato e proverà una vera e propria liberazione quando potrà confessare la propria colpa.Nessuno lo ha visto brandire l’accetta contro le vittime, nessuno lo ha visto scappare. Tuttavia incomincerà a sentirsi male, a provare un incontrollabile rimorso per ciò che ha compiuto, a temere di essere scoperto in qualunque momento e in preda a un’incurabile febbre celebrale sarà ossessionato da continue allucinazioni. Risucchiato da un vortice di disperazione e paura è solo con sé stesso, è intimorito da tutto, cancella indizi, tenta di nascondere le prove, cerca di beffare la ragione e l’assennatezza. In un delirio di onnipotenza arriva anche a sfidare la stessa polizia, scisso, diviso, dilaniato dal proprio atto barbarico –come d’altronde dimostra anche il suo nome- : da una parte sembra voler sfidare le leggi del mondo, ma dall’altra desidera pagare la propria colpa senza sconti di pena. Il lettore lo insegue, lo accantona, lo giudica, lo aiuta a rialzarsi, vinto anch’esso dalla follia del personaggio, che nel suo peregrinare nei quartieri poveri di San Pietroburgo conosce un mondo di relitti umani, in cui la sua degradazione morale si specchia e si riconosce. Solo nel momento in cui la sensazione di essere un superuomo inizierà a vacillare, Raskolnikov troverà il vero coraggio, quello di confessare il delitto commesso.Nessuno dei protagonisti di Delitto e Castigo risulta fine a sé stesso, ma ognuno simboleggia una qualità dall’animo. Raskolnikov è la mente umana in cui le passioni e l’istinto soverchiano e diventano estranei alla ragione. Il “tarantolato” Rodion è solo l’esasperazione di un malessere, che lo rende misantropo, disadattato. Come molti altri personaggi di Dostoevskij manifesta una serie infinita di sintomi –febbre, epilessia, schizofrenia, follia- come giustificazione per tutte le più malsane perversioni che il buon senso può partorire. Una forma di esorcismo, che ancora una volta contrappone il bene al male, senza avere la facoltà e il privilegio di saperli distinguere.Raskolnikov, dopo l’omicidio compiuto nella prima parte del romanzo, vive la propria degenerazione in uno stato di irrazionalità e di paranoia, rifiutando inconsciamente l’amore della razionalità e della ragione, ma cercando sempre di raggiungere i confini, i limiti estremi di quello che è in grado di fare e quello che per lui risulta per natura inaccessibile.Pier Paolo Pasolini nella sua analisi all’opera, vede in Raskolnikov un moderno Edipo, turbato dallo sfrenato affetto proferitogli dalla madre e dalla sorella Dunja. Il protagonista si trova incatenato a questo amore, a cui si aggiungono gli obblighi verso la propria famiglia che, per mantenerlo agli studi universitari, opera innumerevoli sacrifici. L’omicidio della vecchia usuraia sarebbe per Raskolnikov un estremo tentativo di eliminare l’onnipresente e “asfissiante” presenza materna, simbolo di tutti gli obblighi umilianti a cui è sottoposto, il riproporsi continuo del destino a cui sa di non potersi sottrarre.Tuttavia l’omicidio si rivelerà totalmente vano, in quanto la famiglia di Raskolnikov piomberà a San Pietroburgo e il protagonista si troverà a dover intraprendere la propria a voluta “via crucis” verso l’atto finale.Sonja, invece, la dolcissima presenza femminile del romanzo, dai toni sottomessi e onirici, ci viene descritta come la figura chiave dello svolgersi delle vicende. Il compito affidatole dall’autore è quello di spargere amore e speranza. Ragazzina appena diciottenne dalla presenza timida e umile, è la portatrice della più elevata moralità di tutto il libro e aiuterà Raskolnikov ad avvicinarsi alla fede. Non è un caso, infatti, che Dostoevskij renda una prostituta portatrice del messaggio divino. Sonja non farà nulla di straordinario, ma il suo incondizionato amore per Raskolnikov, il suo credo incrollabile nella Provvidenza e la sua totale purezza saranno determinanti per stravolgere completamente il corso degli eventi.Il Vangelo è menzionato nel romanzo solo due volte, accompagnato sempre dalla presenza della ragazza: la prima volta quando il protagonista chiede a Sonja di leggergli il passo della resurrezione di Lazzaro –vicenda parallela alla morte e rinascita spirituale di Raskolnikov- e una seconda volta, ormai nell’epilogo, quando il giovane, esiliato nel penitenziario, ritrova accanto a sé lo stesso Vangelo e, anche senza aprirlo, capisce che l’amore di Sonja lo obbliga ad abbracciare la fede.Attorno alle vicende dei due protagonisti si snodano una serie di storie personali, di intrighi, di personaggi che arricchiscono all’inverosimile un racconto già di per sé un capolavoro. Non svolgono ruoli da poco la sorella di Raskolnikov, Dunja, anch’ella divisa da sentimenti contrastanti, ovvero l’affetto per il fratello, le amorevoli attenzioni della madre e la necessità pratica di concedersi a un “demone” del capitalismo; ancora c’è Razumichìn il devoto e fedelissimo amico del protagonista, simboleggiante l’assennatezza e la ragione, e l’infido Svidrigajlov ossessionato dal proprio passato oscuro, costantemente accompagnato dall’ombra di due delitti e dalle accuse di pedofilia; infine, Porfirij il cervellotico procuratore che ha in mano l’indagine del delitto e i Marmeladov, la famiglia di Sonja, all’apice della degradazione umana rintracciabile nella Pietroburgo di metà ottocento.Tuttavia nessuno di questi personaggi è univocamente buono o cattivo, sano di mente o totalmente folle; non c’è una divisione netta dei caratteri, ogni comportamento appare ambiguo, confuso, e ogni ritratto iniziale evapora, si ricompone, modificandosi a seconda degli stati d’animo, delle circostanze, delle casualità. E anche l’evocativa San Pietroburgo è soggiogata da questo mosaico acquatico e poliedrico. Teatro delle vicende narrate, ci viene offerta attraverso descrizioni che ai nostri occhi la rendono ben diversa e senza dubbio più misera della splendida capitale della Russia zarista che siamo abituati a conoscere.L’insostenibile pena spinge Raskolnikov ad affrontare il castigo, senza dimenticare il fondamentale ruolo svolto dall’atteggiamento di Sonja. L’attimo decisivo che inverte il destino di Raskolnikov è infatti proprio il momento in cui lui le rivela la colpa e lei, candidamente, gliene chiede la ragione. Alle giustificazioni brillanti di filosofia e richiami storici che Raskolnikov, sempre meno convinto, offre a Sonja si contrappone la reazione di lei: genuina, istintiva, concreta, pura. La scena non appare lineare o logica, ma ci viene descritta da Dostoevskij in maniera quasi caotica, dove alla parola di Rodion si contrappone l’emozione di Sonja. Se prima di questo avvenimento la narrazione aveva un ritmo, dopo il colloquio dei due giovani il ritmo accelera, si fa imprudente e impetuoso e i fatti cominciano a precipitare. Fino alla conclusione finale, tormentata prima e successivamente liberatoria.In chiusura Dostoevskij annuncia un seguito atto ad approfondire il passaggio di Raskolnikov alla sua nuova vita: ""Ma qui comincia un'altra storia, la storia del rinnovamento graduale di un uomo, la storia della sua rigenerazione, del passaggio graduale da un mondo a un altro, della presa di coscienza di una nuova realtà fin lì totalmente sconosciuta. Potrebbe essere il tema di una nuova narrazione: ma il nostro racconto attuale ha termine."" Quel seguito non ci sarà mai. Tuttavia non è difficile capire che corso potrebbe aver avuto la rinascita di Rodion Raskolnikov. Un po’ come quello di un condannato a morte che, un’ora prima di morire, pensa che se gli toccasse di vivere su un’alta cima tanto stretta da poterci appoggiare solo i piedi, con intorno solo abissi, oscurità eterna, solitudine e tempesta, e scegliere di rimanere così, in un arscin di spazio, sceglierebbe di vivere in quel modo piuttosto che morire subito. Per mille anni. In eterno. “Vivere come che sia, ma vivere!”. E questa è la verità."

"297",296,"Rachel Dawson","#2As the title states, this book falls under the crime genre. Dostoevsky was an absolutely revolutionary writer, who created the archetype for crafty literary police officers. This novel follows a young Russian student who must fight with the guilt of killing an innocent woman and search for the true meaning of life and suffering. This book opened my eyes to the world of crime novels and film. Although it has been translated from it's original Russian language, the flow of the novel is seemingly effortless. One could read it for hours without looking at the clock. I not only found it an entertaining book, but it's powerful message about inner suffering and how we deal with guilt hit me right in the heart. It causes one to think about human psychology where guilt comes from. The main character was one whom I despised and felt bad for at the same time. It is a lengthy book and can grow a tad bit boring in the beginning when the characters are all being introduced, but is overall an interesting book."
"298",297,"Nazish","Whattay deep profound study of human psychology. The protagonist(Roskolnikov)'s views and his inclination towards crime seem to me to be ironic towards unnatural structure of society and not stemming from his own moral views. He protests against all the sufferings and pain in the world by prostrating his own views of right and wrong. His article on the right of exceptional people to transgress laws and to even shed blood is very much parallel to Napoleon's view of he being 'above all others'. The story though painfully revolving around the same plot without much progress however keeps the reader on the hook with just the right amount of suspense. I would rate this story 4 stars as I really really liked it. For those who think its a drag, keep it saved till winters and have it daily with a cup of coffee in those long dreary winter rainy days !"
"299",298,"Anushree Rastogi","""The resulting picture is sometimes monstrous, but the setting and the whole process of the presentation sometimes happen to be so probable, and with details so subtle, unexpected, yet artistically consistent with the whole fullness of the picture, that even the dreamer himself would be unable to invent them in reality.""After reading an abridged version of this book, I finally have my hands on a translation by Michael Scammel. Delves deep into the hows, whats and whys of human life. I think I'm slowly beginning to understand the ""Raskolnikov effect"", why sometimes people go to great lengths to achieve closure. "
"300",299,"Pete","Certainly one of the most memorable books I have read in recent years. Many ""classic"" novels just don't grab my interest for long. This is the exception. Absolutely incredible. It is no surprise that this novel has remained relevant into the 21st century. This is the Dostoevsky novel that is the most accessible to the modern reader."
"301",300,"Chrissie","I have already read this, and I DO love Dostoyevsky's writing so I figured I would try this as an audiobook, since it was free at Downpour. Will I give it four stars as I did before? NO, this time it gets five!!!Where to start? With the easy stuff. The narration by by Anthony Heald was superb. Some characters cough, some characters have a special evil laugh. Attention was taken to deliver a stupendous performance. I felt I was at a theater. This is a case where the narration is the icing on a delicious cake, an interesting cake that intrigues and is delicious! A narrator can influence how we, the listeners, interpret the personalities of characters and the importance of events. I felt that the written words perfectly matched the narrator's inflections. Some characters are at times very irritating, The narration drove this home perfectly. THEN there is a switch in tone and you begin to see how intelligent that creep really is. I am speaking of the investigating lawyer. Wow, as the story unfolds this character and others come alive. They have depth. Not one person is simple. People are complicated, and my praise for this book focuses primarily on how Dostoyevsky draws his characters. It takes a while to know them, just as it does with real people. People are complicated and Dostoyevsky's characters are all complicated, and so they become real people. If you are a cool, collected and self-assured person not interested in analyzing human behavior, you might differ with my judgment and say the characters are ridiculously emotional, crazy, neurotic. I say they are real people! His characters reflect the behavior of you and I. That is what I say.When you listen you see where people live, and it is not a pretty picture. You know that painting by Chagall of a twisted bed up in the garret? That is what is delivered, but with words. Life in St. Petersburg in the 1860s, when this novel first came out (1866). Dostoyevsky writes about what he knows.You also clearly see that this novel was written as a monthly installment for a magazine. Each month's installment grabs your interest, keeps you hanging and at the end you simply are compelled to read the next installment. What will happen? Dostoyevsky delivers not only character analysis but also a page turner. Somebody gets killed. Someone is murdered. Drownings. Parties. Marriages. People run over. A lot happens, and this is not what usually attracts me to a book, but I loved it! I wish contemporary writers could write page-turners as exciting as this.Dostoyevsky even presents religion in a manner I can swallow. You get a page-turner. You get character analysis, and you get psychological and philosophical knots to untwist. When you commit a crime, how is punishment delivered?"

"304",303,"Ksenia Anske","I ponder how to even begin writing this. A review. Such a little pitiful thing compared to the book. I ponder also, pondered, rather, while I was reading it, rereading it (read it in Russian in my teens), I pondered…no, I was trying to understand it from the height of my almost forty years, again, what the book was about. And it struck me as very simple. Hence the love for it, perhaps, and the many hearts it has touched. It’s about human nature. The uncertainty of it all, the seeking, the searching, the contemplating, and, ultimately, finding love. Because there is nothing else, only love. That’s all we seek. To be “resurrected by love”. Besides, take it from a Russian (yes, I was born and raised in Russia), this particular translation by Pevear and Volokhonsky beats all previous versions. The language. Oh, the language, the nuances, the colors, the tones, the dialogue! Everything is preserved! It’s as close to Russian as you will get it in English. So read it. If you haven’t yet, read it, it’s a masterpiece. It will touch you on a level you thought was not possible. At least I thought it was not possible, and it touched me. The human suffering, all of it, in one book. How is that even possible? It is. Somehow. I hold the book and I still can’t believe what I’m holding. As to the story itself…Russia. St. Petersburg. A poor student. A scholar. A shabby pitiful closet he lives in. In poverty, no, in complete destitution. That is Rodion Raskolnikov. He occupies his time by planning to murder a pawn-broker, Alyona Ivanovna, an old hag, an insignificant “louse”, as he calls her. Now, because you might be unfamiliar with that happens next (which is hard to imagine, given the publicity of the story, but still), I will withhold the plot and let you discover it on your own. In that case, i case you haven’t read it or don’t know what it’s about, WARNING: do not read the foreword! It will spoil the story for you, but do read it after you’re done. It’s got great insights and facts about both the book and the author. Anyway. I’m getting distracted. The book is, in fact, about precisely the things it spells out in its title. Crime and punishment. What it means, to commit a crime, what is crime, what is the punishment for it, and what it means to endure it. There are many chance encounters that will pull Raskolnikov this way or the other in his journey, and that is life. It’s what happens to us, every day. We think we know, we think we figured it out, then life comes at us and fools us. The beauty of the book perhaps is in this. Life hasn’t changed much. In that, it reads fresh, there is no feeling of it being written in the nineteenth century. I know I will be coming back to this book again, and again, and again. And I envy you, if you will read it for the first time, because I wish I could do it again."
"305",304,"Wersly","Best of all Russian Literature, best of all Dostoyevsky. Gripping and exciting to the modern eye, despite being over a century old. Very few books preserve their intensity or relate-ability over that span of time. This book is wonderful."
"306",305,"Shyam Shankar","Dostoyevsky, instead of narrating a person's life, makes us live it by etching his characters profoundly well, that each of the persons we come across are discussed in various depths of multitude which is without saying that there is not a single hero or a single villain in this classic, Crime and Punishment. Though, I felt a little bit let down with the translation of David McDuff, which I think is just a reason for me to read the same novel from another translator, Dostoyevsky is, by no means, a master story-teller and to some extent a psycho analyst who never fails to portray or precisely introduce your heart to yourself.. Scintillating in all aspect..."
"307",306,"Paige Dayley","For some reason they seem to only have Crime in Punishment in Spanish--weird. Anyhow, this has long been a favorite of mine. I tend to favor tragedies over comedies because tragedies generally give you more to think about and learn from than comedies. I enjoy reading light, fun, stuff--but then I forget about it. Tragedies, and whatever wisdom they offer, tend to stay with me.Anyhow--Crime and Punishment is not a tragedy, it actually has a redemptive ending. But I love how it deals with the ""modern"" issues of nineteenth century St. Petersburg--and that the issues of poverty, education, marriage, women's rights, prostitution, science,suffering, and religion are still just as relevant today. Raskolnikov, despite being a cold-blooded murderer, ends up being someone you sympathize with and relate to. He's someone whose very nature is split between the selfish, modern man--and the compassionate christian who wants to alleviate other people's suffering.It's really good!"

"311",310,"Pete Kelly","Slow moving, dense and thought provoking. This is a disturbing tale of a descent into immorality and the subsequent repercussions arising from the central character, Rakolnikov's actions.

"312",311,"JJVid","What would it be like to murder? How could you justify it to yourself? And if you actually decided to do it could you steel your convictions all the way through and resolve, when it was all over, that you acted rightly? Would you torment yourself for this moral transgression, or would you become paranoid that your ""crime"" would be found out?This is my first book by Dostoevsky and, knowing his reputation as a Russian mogul of literature, I was very surprised how simply he told this story. I hardly had recourse to a dictionary, there were few esoteric references to Russian history, and the story was told directly without any obscurantism or attempts to keep the reader in the dark. The greatest hurdle was in getting straight the various names of characters; e.g. Rodion Romanovich, Raskolnikov, and Rodya are all the same character; Sofya = Sonia, Pyotor Petrovich = Luzhin, and the name Ivanovna is not a surname and does not denote familial ties to other Ivanovnas. This caused some confusion.The story centers around Raskolnikov's ""crime"" and his grappling with the consequences of its fallout. He is a split-character, bipolar, who alternatively belauds and condemns his actions, firstly, as evidence of superiority over the human race (he calls others ""louses"") and, secondly, as stupid, foolish, and rash. He spends much of the book not in a moral purgatory between the rightness and wrongness of his crime, but in paranoia over his ""crime"" being found out. Paranoia, delirium, and physical illness all further obscure his thoughts and perceptions; does Zosimov know he's guilty, or is he imagining it, or did he give away too much by his words, or was he too eager in feigning innocence, did that draw attention?I don't tend to write in the margins of non-fiction books very often, but with this I found myself furiously scratching in pejoratives and exclamation marks throughout. The book got a rise out of me, and I think that evidence enough for the quality of Dostoevsky's writing. "

A good reminder why crime doesn't pay, because even if the law doesn't punish you your own mind surely will.

"319",318,"Richard Simpson","Impressions from Dostoyevsky have remained with me throughout my life, for the good and the bad. His eldritch realism and psychological insight strikes me as the most authentic not only for its time but for the future. Most of all, he exhibits the dark morbid human urge to self-destruct, an urge which often has no reason (if the icy and often gothic corners of pre-revolution St Petersburg is not enough of a reason). The most enduring image for me: Marmeladov. Often I would sit drinking alone in hovels in the Far East that could have been plucked from a novel of Dosotoyevsky's, and would recall this lowly alcoholic civil servant, knowing in my heart I was on the same path of doom but nevertheless became morbidly cheerful and jocular before and as all the madness ensued. It was like I gloated in my own misery. In this way Dostoyevsky is all the more convincing. I lived the humiliation and spiritual purgatory of being a real-life Marmeladov, though I'm happy to have experienced something of redemption. On the subject of redemption, Crime and Punishment is something of an anomaly with Dostoyevsky because Raskolnikof finds his, though this has always seemed to me a rather arbitrary and forced ending to the work which is overshadowed and possibly made impotent by the ominosity and turmoil of the preceding chapters. It's a pity I read translation, but I feel nothing in spirit is lost: Dostoyevsky is one of those rare life-changing writers, because his themes are still pressing, no matter how they are delivered. Realistic, he is also controversial, dealing with the paedophile (a subject skirted by most in the 19th century) in Svidrigailov, a character who is equally terrifying but more repugnant than Raskolnikof. What could be more dramatic than Svidrigailov's fate? What could be more spooky than his matter of fact accounts of supernatural experiences? When I first read it gave me the goosebumps. Yes, dostoyevsky has it all, and St Petersburg is transmogrified symbolically into the human mind, so that, probably for the worse, you never know what might be unmasked within its chambers. "

"325",324,"Steven van Doorn","Crime and Punishment is an examination of human nature, addressing themes such as crime and punishment (duh), love and hate, innocence and experience, good and evil, bravery and cowardice, wealth and poverty and social class. There are a lot of themes woven together here and the story takes a long time to tell. That was my only problem with the book, I felt like the beginning was strong and then the middle was longer than it needed to be, before an ending that was just right. The feel of the story is somewhat similar to Catcher in the Rye in that you follow the main character closely as he makes a serious of odd and seemingly unreasonable choices. There are many powerful scenes scattered throughout the book that made me stop and think about philosophy, morality and human nature.Deservedly a classic."

I had to hash out what the book was making me think and how frustrated I became with the selfish egotistical main character. But unlike so many novels I've read, the ending was utterly satisfying and like a breath of fresh air. I almost want to label this book as a work disproving our very barbaric theory of evolution with no God.

"328",327,"Kritika","This is one intelligent book.It starts out as a crime novel, with the murderer plotting and executing his grand scheme. And then it changes - it isn't really about how the murderer evades the police, although that's part of it. It's about the ideology that led him to commit the crime, the psychology of a criminal struggling with what he did, and how isolation can lead to some very bad things. All the characters are incredibly complex, and even the minor characters are intriguing. But more than anything else, this is a story about redemption.You might think there is a problem when you can say that you identify with a fictional Russian murderer, but that is the situation I find myself in. No, I haven't killed anyone and I don't plan to. What I see in Raskolnikov is his schism between his intelligent, ambitious side and his selfless compassion. He is the physical representation of the idea that humans are not all good or all bad, but rather complex creatures that cannot be judged. He may be a murderer, but he gives away his last penny to a poor family he hardly knows. He both loves and hates his family - love for their support and unconditional affection and hatred for the reminder of how he isn't who they think he is. He becomes physically ill with fear and guilt and repents the murder, then turns around and says it isn't a crime in the first place. Sure, it's extreme, but don't we all lie to ourselves sometimes? We never want to admit that what we did is wrong, and even if we do, we come up with a justification for it. We're human. Dostoevsky is able to capture that in all his characters, all of whom are incredibly complex. They are not all realistic (a few are complete extremes), but they all reflect facets of the human consciousness.This is one of the best books I have ever read. Not only does it have a lot of value as a reflection of humans and as a story of redemption, it is just a plain good story on it's own. What more can you ask for?"
"329",328,"Lauryl","Oh, Dostoevsky characters and their gorgeous thirst for suffering. (I would have said Russians, not just these characters, but I know even less about actual Russians.) This was a hard book to read, making you feel a murderer's desperation right up to the end. Like a mini (and more unpleasant) Brothers Karamazov, it doesn't present a mere argument, but wants you to ""waterski across the surface"" and the grace and the fierce joy will seep into your bones instead of just your brains. Sounds like it might have gotten into Nietzsche's bones--referencing the dream of the beaten horse, the afterword in my book has this footnote: ""Not only art, but also life, imitates art. Friedrich Nietzsche, who admired Dostoyevsky immensely, and especially Crime and Punishment, in his last conscious act before he collapsed in a coma in the streets of Turin and into the insanity that lasted the rest of his life, threw his arms around the neck of a horse a cabby was belaboring with the whip. See W. J. Kaufmann, Nietzsche, Cleveland and New York, Meridian Books, 1962, p. 57.""If only it had gotten more into Albert Camus."

Che Guevara was a well read man, who empathized with the poor but he did execute quiet a few people for war crimes. BoomRodya wasn't capricious & callous enough for the task though. He lacked ""courage of conviction"", he wasn't a bigot which made him question the authenticity of his own theories. One ought be priggish if planning to commit murder so as to be immune from the ""pangs of conscience"".Are ideas of a better world(which subjectively depends on one's prejudices), an excuse enough that gives one the right to kill people? They maybe terrorists for some but freedom fighters for others, depending only upon one's perspective. Are we only searching for an excuse to kill, so as to assuage some deep seated lust for blood? Is our purpose as human beings of benevolence, gratitude & love or is this nature just prompted by conceit? Is it human nature to do bad, while it takes special efforts for one to do good? Is lacking the wits to commit crime, which is nothing but protests against an unjust society, a manifestation of growing submissiveness among people? Does the ability to perceive evil makes me evil as well? Dostoevsky mocked this nihilistic attitude which was proliferating among the newer generations but at the same time he himself agrees with some of their ideas as he concurs to morality but not propriety.This book is an exploration into the abyss of human conscience.Those who prefer their principles over their happiness, they refuse to be happy outside the conditions they seem to have attached to their happiness.-CamusI don't know if I'm using this out of context but what Camus means here is that if killing people makes Rodya feel like Napoleon & gives some sort of purpose to his life. He should do it. But he met Sonya who pushed him further to purgatory, on his journey of religious redemption. Personally the ideas of suffering and sin seem ancient to me, though they were exactly what Dostoevsky was aiming at. As Rodya realized his love for Sonya, he found purpose in his existence and a renewed empathy for the world which he had lost in cynicism. His love for Sonya had made him confess in the first place, of which he was unaware at the time and only after seeing her intense suffering which had at first attracted him to her, was he finally able get over his pride.I also read parts of A Calendar of Wisdom... a few months ago. This is a collection of quotes chosen by Tolstoy on which he felt one should base their life. He gives the idea that living an ascetic life is the only way one can have a clear conscience. It is definitely easier to succumb to Camus, while ideas of a better world & way of life which came out of spiritual experiences that Tolstoy & Dostoevsky had seem rigid & to some extent even alien, but then its only our choices and their consequence that define the essence of life.

Hardly have time to read these days, though, so don't know when I will manage to finish it. But read the foreword describing his life, and believe me I had a lump in my throat, and the only reason I didn't cry was because as a man I am not used to expressing my emotions. Maybe with age, one's empathy and emotionality does increase. The story of a young man who commits an absolutely inane murder, and then spends the rest of his life in piteous agony for it - the story is really very touching. The message is: no matter what you do to escape punishment from authorities, no matter how successful you are in that, your conscience will still extract a full and exact retribution for your sins. "
"335",334,"Chaundra","I first read this book at 16, which was my first foray into Russian literature and ignited a passion for the genre that sticks with me. In many ways you could say that this book set me on the path that ultimately led to a degree in Russian language and six fantastic months in St. Petersburg, which I still cherish. I tend to come back to this novel every few years and never cease to discover new aspects of the characters and their story. I must say, however, that with each read Svidrigailov becomes more and more enigmatic, although his fever dreams towards the end of the book are some of my favourite passages. Fantastically woven and one of the best examples of Dostoevsky's style.This translation is a bit odd, though, from a native English speaker's perspective. No doubt it captures much better the actual rhythm of the Russian (of which I've only read excerpts) and is more idiomatic, but at times I think the translation in trying to stay authentic to that voice makes the story more difficult to read and comprehend. Translation is always a tricky business, and this is a really interesting exploration of those issues, but ultimately sacrifices fluidity for accuracy. "
"336",335,"Dylan Popowicz","Dostoevsky has never disappointed me, and neither has a translation by Pevear/Volokhonsky. This is likely the most popular, or shall we say: widely known, book of Dostoevksy's, and whereas it doesn't strike me down quite as well as his masterpiece The Brothers Karamzov, the conclusion of this novel had me weeping for Raskolinkov, Dostoevsky, and for myself. Although I'm not sure if that's going to make immediate sense. Like with all of his stories, the moral and philosophical implications are astounding. Here we have the plight of a character, the young intellectual, torn by the results of reason and the emotional nature of the man. There are no answers here, everything is simply torn apart in opposite directions in a series of unsure moments. This is what makes existentialist literature: the uncertainty of a modern world in which we find the simplicities of black and white, those things that made myth a long time ago (now slowly fading away, aside from in fairy tales, kid's stories, a variety of religious situations etc.) suddenly struck down by a torrent of possibilities. Man has, once again, dug himself a deep grave (a certain aspect of Rushdie's ""The Satanic Verses"" on faith over reason comes to mind . . .).But it's not just that: it's a great novel all by itself. Characters, poetry, artistry and a narrative that can only be of Dostoevsky's pen . . . It is becoming all too clear to me that anyone that even attempts to knock Fyodor's work should likely be lined up and shot. I realise that books that are often forced upon children in High School are difficult to read with an unbiased eye (and with frauds like ""The Great Gatsby"" lying around, I can't blame everyone). Yet, I wasn't lucky enough to be given such great literature to read for school. For anyone that has removed this book from their future read list because of its history in schooling: just give it that last chance. It's a slow start that builds up slowly, but that last three-hundred pages had been drooling over the edge of a hotel lobby armchair . . . "
"337",336,"Tim Geis","I read David Magarshack's translation in the mid 1980s in undergraduate studies, required text. But I had an extremely difficult time finishing this novel. Raskolnikov is no ""Superman."" He is a cowering, deeply disturbed individual. His murderous crimes are heinous. His dreams while asleep are crying out to him like blood from the ground where he had slain his victims. He is pursued by the law. A young woman visits him in prison, his only connection to purest love."
"338",337,"Jackson","After long await, [i] Crime and punishment [/i] has been finished. I have to say that I'm a fan. [i] Crime and Punishment [/i] is easily one of the best books I've read in a while. I'm glad I was recommended to read this.Anyways, the basic plot line is Rodion Raskolnikov is a very attractive, yet poor man, who desperately needs some money. Between nights in Taverns, he gets a letter from his mother saying that his sister is getting married to a government official, and that the entire family will be moving to St. Petersburg, where he is living, making him more desperate for money. He ends up killing an old pawn broker and her sister for some belongings and spare change. The rest is plot summary.This was really intriguing to me, not only because it was an interesting book, but because Dostoevsky put his own experience into the story, in a way (His last second recall from a firing line), which makes the book much more real. My favorite part of the book was his nightmare about the Mule, where a drunken crowd beats up and kills a defenseless Mule. It was terrible and it brought a side of Raskolnikov that we didn't see. Genuinely Terrified. The one quote that stuck with me was [blockquote]“I used to analyze myself down to the last thread, used to compare myself with others, recalled all the smallest glances, smiles and words of those to whom I’d tried to be frank, interpreted everything in a bad light, laughed viciously at my attempts ‘to be like the rest’ –and suddenly, in the midst of my laughing, I’d give way to sadness, fall into ludicrous despondency and once again start the whole process all over again – in short, I went round and round like a squirrel on a wheel.” [/blockquote]This was because it was at a really good part of the book and the quality of the quote at the time it was presented was outstanding. It made me think for a little bit, somI decided it was the perfect quote to put in here.Overall, [i] Crime and Punishment [/i] was a very good read, and I'll enjoy more work from him. I'd give the book a 10/10."
"339",338,"Dugan Maynard","A wonderful book with amazing psychological depth. As with Leo Tolstoy, you feel that you know all of the characters intimately; so, while you may dislike a specific character, you fully understand why they are the way they are and what motivates their actions. In general I would say this book is best to read when you're younger-- there's such a strong feeling of angst and anger throughout the book that I think you really need to be in that mindset to connect with the characters. A great book for highschool students really.I would imagine that this book, like many books that have been translated, will vary depending on the translation, therefore finding a good translation is key. Personally, I really liked this edition though."
"340",339,"Koen","It is striking how much you relate with this main character. And so I began wondering who I was to kill, being in Raskolnikov's situation.

Take note of that!Have fun with this book! You'll finish it in no time. It is both rational and irrational, funny, exciting and even boring when it has to be. But above all it is a piece so perfectly well written, it makes you stop in awe for a moment everytime you get to a new chapter.PS: Is it me or did 'Petersburg' seem to be as big as my home town?

"342",341,"Rúben","I had high expectations about this book, given its master piece status. But even with such high expectations, the book was an amazing read, often disturbing and depressing. It made made me think a lot. These are some of my thoughts:1. Human psychology and life in general (including those incredibly random circumstances) can lead one to such a miserable state that you are prone to commit mistakes or even crimes. Chaos theory? Or simply mental disorder (brain damage)?2. Some mistakes can ruin your life, especially because of the shame you feel before your loved ones. For me, this constitutes the punishment, the pain you inflict in your dear ones. ""Let my life go, if only my dear ones may be happy."" This sacrifice for those that are close to you is always present.3. It is delicious the way Dostoyevsky glances through the clash between right and wrong, and the law of man (i.e. the law of the powerful, of those that succeed and write their own history).4. The book must have made a big impact when it was released and afterwards. Like many have pointed out, it may have influenced Freud's work in psychology. I can also see a very close link with Frankl's idea that ""Men can get used to anything"" and that we aim for something bigger than us (""he had been ready a thousand times before to give up existence for the sake of an idea, for a hope, even for a fancy""). Truman Capote must also have read this book."

It is immensely fascinating."
"347",346,"Juan-Pablo","A compelling classic: a page turner with deep layersSometimes I'm intimidated before I start old classics. The novel may not speak as directly as a contemporary work, one say. However, Crime and Punishment doesn't fall at all in this category. It is a page turner like any good best-seller. But it also speaks at many different layers, and that's what, I think, makes it a classic. The main character (Raskolnikov) embodies the whole process of guilt in the few months that novel covers. But it's also a representation of much more. He's a person of its time, with all the impact that Napoleon had on the youth during the 19th Century. He also represents the process of the child growing up and falling in love. He symbolizes the ""Bon Sauvage"" falling in disgrace and learning that real freedom comes mainly from social immersion. This novel is much more than I can probably express. A very recommended read, this french edition is small and good. It has a a moderate number of footnotes that put 19th Century Russia in context. The extras of this edition are also helpful."
"348",347,"John","The original and still the most compelling of the psychological crime dramas. It works on so many different levels from the sociological motives for crime to the reasons for Christian redemption."
"349",348,"Scarlett","By now I have read most of Dostoyevsky's grand works, but I had purposely left what is perhaps his most well-known for last, since I sometimes have this tendency to leave (what I think can be) the best for last, especially with authors that I'm a fan of. I can safely say I have deeply enjoyed reading all of his novels, and that this was no exception, although I would reserve the title of best for ""The Brothers Karamazov"". However, I can understand why so many people deem this as his best. It is perhaps the perfect balance of a swift, endlessly entertaining plot and a complex psychological study of characters, or of THE character, our deeply tortured Raskolnikov. I've read some other reviews which complain of its slowness or lack of action; or perhaps that Dostoyevsky's prose meanders too much into the characters's thoughts and states of mind; to them I'd recommend to stay away from his other novels then, because they would probably find them even more exasperating in this sense. Once Raskolnikov sets out to do what he so much ponders about in the first pages, I found it very hard to put down. Indeed, I finished the second half of this rather long book in one sitting, so engrossed was I in the authour's description of the character's mind, his sudden changes of mood, his delusion, his absorbing encounters with the detective Porfiry (who somewhat reminded me of ""Homicide""'s Pempleton, a tv show cop known for his interrogation skills), Razumikhin's faithfulness and abject friendship, Sonya's pure-heartedness despite the life she was pushed to live, the utter disgrace of Marmeladov's entire family in fact, ruined by liquor, the mysterious, voluptuous and vile Svidrigailov and his strange good deeds, Katerina Ivanovna clutching at the last remnants of her dignity in despair, Raskolnikov's dream of the beaten horse that still lingers in my mind; and in short, everything!I simply cannot recommend this book enough, especially for lovers of psychological studies. "
"350",349,"Allison Nyssens","This is my most favourite book in the world. Just is. I'm not going to discuss it, because someone will come along and argue with me. And I'm not going to argue about my favourite book."
"351",350,"Karthik","Intense and gripping right from the start. It almost reads like a mystery novel, not because you don't know whodunnit, but because you don't quite understand why, and this propels you to the end of this marvelous book that tries to portray the psyche of a human being that violates a social and legal boundary, and finds himself lonely and persecuted as he tries to hide his dirty little secret. "
"352",351,"Bart Kleijngeld","Be warned: this is full of spoilers!My love for slow, philosophical novels has braught me to reading another of the Russian classics, viz. Crime & Punishment. My expectations were high, this being a highly celebrated all-time classic and all, but they were met.We get to peek in the mind of Raskolnikov, and quite thoroughly I might add! Dostoyevsky could very well have lived these thoughts and crimes himself, so meticulously and passionate are the descriptions of Raskolnikov's contemplations and feverish dreams. The disharmony of his soul jumps off the page and immediately provokes genuine feelings of pity for the murderer. Not in a cheap, enforcing way, but as a natural response to the objective description. Moreover, much is ambiguous and uncertain in the book. For example, one can argue if Raskolnikov's illness has caused him to think and act so extremely, or if it's the other way around. As another example, even the most evil seeming character Svidrigailov seems to have moments of compassion, like when he dreams of taking care of the five year old girl, and how he lets Doenja leave his house after she aimed the gun at him, after which he takes his own life.That's something I love about this book: there's no straightforward line to follow from begin to end, neither is it so much about the plot. Everything revolves forming an opinion about the persons and their deeds, challenging you to evaluate your own ethical values as well.Something else that really spoke to me is how the typical noble people of society are depicted as fake and pretentious, most obviously through the dispicable person of Loesjin. The most depraved of people on the other hand, are -generally- treated with more respect. They may act cruelly and selfishly often, but at least they are driven to it by poverty and misery and don't polish up their deeds with nice words and customs like the noble do. They, at least, are 'real'. This, I believe, is one of the reasons why it's not only easy to forgive Raskolnikov for his crime, but frequently even respect him as an ethical individual; that is to see him as a hero. He saves the whores, the drunks and what not, and throws money around to do so like some Robin Hood figure, while loathing -and incidentally killing- the more privileged.This book was written in a time where Nietzsche announced what he believed to be the death of God and where Kierkegaard struggled with how to view faith with nihilism trying to lure him to the dark side, and this book fits right in. Raskolnikov (and Svidrigailov even more so) has no faith in God, although he is in conflict about it from time to time. This once again marks him as an interesting, not definitely/completely ill or evil person who deserves at least some degree of pity. His essay also closely resembles the distinction Nietzsche made between Übermensch and the common people, and Kierkegaard's comparison of the massively reproducing plebe and intellectually superior persons in some of his darker passages.[1] And what an essay it is: the theory makes (at least some) sense in a strictly rational way and is highly interesting and elaborately put. Yet, there's more to ethics than sheer rationality and theory, and one might consider Raskolnikov mentally ill (narcissism comes to mind) because of his extremity in this regard. Then again, if the reasoning is sound, on what ground can we reject these ideas? One might refer to 'the law' or 'an ethical common sense', but that brings us back to the core question in Raskolnikov's Godless, fundamentally nihilistic view: if he is one of the superior individuals, those grounds would not be valid for rejection. Who's to say his extreme beliefs and deeds won't indeed lead to a better world as has been the case more often with exceptional people? It's a beautiful discussion.Although I think this book is brilliant, there are of course some things I disliked. Most of all, sadly, the ending. The epilogue was mostly redundant as a whole as far as I'm concerned, since its high pace was unfitting and its contents relatively unnecessary, but the actual ending is simply bad in my opinion. Luckily this is not a very big deal since in a book such as this the plot is not the main objective, furthermore it's easy to look at the epilogue as an optional appendix. Still, it's worth mentioning and a shame. However, I should also add that the dream about the epidemic of tiny creatures who have a will of their own and infect people with egocentrism (so to speak) adds very nicely to the philosophical main theme of the book.Furthermore there have been some silences between people and some gestures and meetings that felt a bit unrealistic, but nothing to complain extensively about.To conclude, I would like to give my opinion on Raskolnikov, his crime and punishment, and especially on his theory and its relation to his illness.Personally, I think some people are born with a sufficient lack of empathy to be capable of killing, and some of them even are attracted to the extremity of it. Raskolnikov however, does not seem to belong to this group of psychopaths. His suffering, his need for a theoretical basis to finally commit the act as a means to an idealistic end instead of just out of curiosity, seems to point in a different direction. Personally I think his nihilistic view combined with the suffering and the inequality and suffering he has witnessed in his life have moved him -he happens to be a rational and intelligent type of person- to extreme thinking. Here's where it becomes interesting however. Your typical psychopath would probably have committed the crime without having to go through all this. However, many people of Raskolnikov's intellect could arrive at this theory and world view, but would not even come close to actually performing the associated deeds. The fact that Raskolnikov does cross this line tells me his mind is not what one would call normal. Moreover there are the psychosomatic fevers that make plausible that this is indeed the case. So, in my opinion, he is one of those few people who is predisposed to 'go mad', instead of being mad to begin with, and circumstance did in fact trigger this behaviour ultimately.Once again this makes him a charming victim with whom it is easy to have pity.Wonderfully complex and inspiring, indeed a masterpiece."
"353",352,"Susan","I read this again after a number of decades. I had forgotten a lot of it; what I remembered the most were the cat-and-mouse interactions between detective Petrovich and Raskolnikov.What struck me on this second read was the way in which so much is viewed from the point-of-view of Raskolnikov. We are often inside his head, privy to his thoughts.This interior view was often tension-provoking, in tune with Raskolnikov's building anxiety.I had wondered a couple of times, while reading, about any relationship between Dostoevsky and Poe. After I finished, I found this in Wikipedia: ""Fyodor Dostoevsky called Poe 'an enormously talented writer' and favorably reviewed Poe's detective stories. The character Porfiry Petrovich in Dostoevsky's novel 'Crime and Punishment' was influenced by Dupin."" [Dupin being Poe's detective.]Adiga's 'White Tiger' also came to mind as I read, although that story had a different outcome. Nonetheless, it has been called ""the Indian Crime and Punishment.""I also thought about Dostoevsky and Dickens, those eighteenth-century novelists. In fact, Dostoevsky apparently interviewed Dickens, in London, in 1862. One interesting point of similarity between them is the original twelve-month serialized publication schedule of 'Crime and Punishment,' which compares with the frequent publication of Dickens' novels in serial form.I kept a character list at hand (as I had for Tolstoy's 'Anna Karenina'). I also had access to an excellent map of Saint Petersburg of the time, with references to places important in 'Crime and Punishment.' Both of these aids helped a lot while reading the book."
"354",353,"Devin","I LOVED this book. Being inside the mind of a killer, who has enough of a conscience to wonder if he should turn himself in, is really fascinating. Now and then, you actually find yourself rooting for him in a way! It's crazy."

"356",355,"Idontlikethissite","Not to be taken in a sarcastic or ironic tone. But this book can be accurately summarized by its title if only read in the perspective of someone who has finished it. Very far from an easy read, but worth the effort. Whether you enjoy reading or not the message that can be found among these pages is brilliant. Reading between the lines wouldn't hurt either. There is much to find in the human mind. Yet its vastness makes it hard for anyone to locate their answers. We make rash decisions without further thinking of the consequences. We are our own worst enemies, and you punish yourself internally for the crimes that betray you externally."

"358",357,"K","In Poland, every high school student has to read this book. And I have to say it's no mistake. I still can't believe that I spent two days doing nothing but reading it. I love it because of the psychological side to it. It's kind of funny how Raskolnikov kills two women, but his thoughts, his insane thoughts, are pretty much the thoughts of every person. For some people the fact that the crime is commited in the beginning of the book is Dostoyevsky's mistake. But for me, the things that happened after the crime were the most interesting. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the ending - it ruined exactly everything. But still, my rating is 5 stars because after reading the book, it's not the ending I remember - it's the story."
"359",358,"Peter Andrus","There is no way for me to give this book anything but 5 stars. There were things i disliked about it, but regardless it is a pretty impressive read.Let me give some of the things i liked about it:it plays on some of the same themes as my favorite book: ""Les Miserables"". In fact, it seems to me that this is actually just the Russian version of that story. If you take the fact that both crimes were committed because of a society blind to the needs of its people, an upper-class that ignores the pleas of the lower class, and a justice system that is blind to all but the letter of the law, then these books share many parallels and similarities. i love stories about redemption in any form.One quote i LOVED toward the end: "" Vague and aimless anxiety in the present, and in the future a continual sacrifice leading to nothing-that was all that lay before him"". This quote could have come from so many great works of literature: Les Miserables, Death of a Salesman, Grapes of Wrath. There were a few doozies like this. I loved the idea that pervaded in the end, similar to Grapes of Wrath, that in the end the only thing that can save us is love and finding meaning in life. The author offered some interesting discussions at the end about the difference between the existential and faith based interpretations of this book. I really enjoyed those, though they were very brief.The chapter just before,during, and after the murder is some of the most white-knuckled prose i've ever read. The tension was so great that i had to put the book down a few times and catch my breath. i found myself saying ""DON'T DO IT MAN!"" a few times while reading.... amazing stuff.Some of the things i didn't enjoy:The names are so confusing as to be totally distracting. Each character has 2 or 3 names they go by. The author switches between those names freely, and no explanation is given. I spoke to my sister-in-law about this (she was a missionary in Russia) and she confirmed that these are basically nicknames. However, not knowing this little Russian tidbit i was VERY confused for a good portion of the beginning. I don't know if it's just this translation that i read, but as some of the characters talked they inserted ""he-he-he"" a lot, as to imply, i assume, that they were being facetious or condescending or something because they were giggling as they talk. However, it was in there so much that it sounded bizarre in my inner dialogue and a few of the characters seemed to me like the Joker from Batman was talking. I know it sounds like a weird complaint, but it was real!the story starts out quickly, then meanders a bit in the middle with all the ""these dudes want to marry my sister!"" stuff. after the tense first chapters it made me slow down and almost stop reading. i'm glad, though, that i stuck it out.In the end, i'm glad i read this book. i am sure that some of its meaning will become more clear to me as i search through what i read over the years. i look forward to reading 'the Brothers Karamazov', but i hope i can keep the names straight!"
"360",359,"Wassima Kara","Ce roman a bouleversé mes idées, a tout changé dans ma manière de penser. Il est ce genre de livres dont je vais parler longtemps et sans cesse. Je vais rien dire maintenant à son propos, je veux encore laisser mes pensés pénétrer les événements et les personnages que je vais Jamais jamais jamais oublier ! "
"361",360,"Karan Gupta","Dostoyevsky had impressed me immensely in ""The Idiot"". His style of story telling was utterly grasping, even though he frequently digressed from the topic at hand to discuss unrelated philosophies which might have been more applicable in the Russian society of his times but were still interesting enough to stir the contemporary reader into thought. So it was with high hopes that I picked up this book : hailed as the greatest of Dostoyevsky's novels.The inception of the story was in a time when the Russians were facing a society divided between the thought schools of socialism and nihilism. On one hand was the idea of a society that was communal, where every one would live for the society as a whole, working for the benefit of every comrade. On the other hand were the nihilists who defied all authority and believed in their own right to make their life better by any necessary means. Dostoyevsky is supposedly inspired into the concept by the happenings around him when certain members of the intelligentsia abused their power to reason.The book begins with an immediate focus on the protagonist and the narration sticks to him throughout without any change in the vantage point. The book relays the emotional tumult that the protagonist goes through in his views regarding what a crime is and who the concept of crime applies to. The emotional uncertainty and the nagging moral conscience are real enough to relate to on a much lower level. The various characters throwing light on how a human brain works and why it reasons as it does. The visions of grandeur that one is better than the crowd around him. The craving to prove himself in some way. The hesitation of ""the first step"" and the belief in a justification beyond. All these are very clearly expressed in either the discussions among the characters or the subauditions of the protagonist, Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov finally gives in to the physical strain that the mental harassment puts him under. But his final salvation comes from Sofya, a religious girl forced into prostitution because of poverty. Utterly symbolic of the corruption that has crept into the thoughts of the educated middle classes of every society where the rightfulness of a person is judged by his profession and social status.The plot was gripping beyond comparison. There were times towards the middle and the end of the story when I simply could not help turning page after page, pushing back my sleep till after another chapter, then yet another chapter. The character building was nothing short of brilliant. The unnecessary details left out. The story ran as smoothly as conceivable.Crime And Punishment exceeded it's reputation. An excellent read to say the least. Dostoyevsky impressed again and I will surely pick up another work of his before long."
"362",361,"Logan Cunningham","One of my favorite books. All the characters feel real and are memorable, especially Raskolnikov as he is an example of a troubled and conflicted character done right. Dostoevsky is a master of combining prose with philosophy. The book is just great and shows why Dostoevsky is considered the founder of modern existentialism."
"363",362,"Pilar","I love this book because the story is amazing. The reader feels atracted by the difficult story of Raskolnikov, that sometimes you feel a deep shame and sadness for this killer. Also, we analyse the psycology of the human being, and finally we understand what a big is the punishment of our own consciousness: the repentance. "
"364",363,"Joseph Heindel","This has been my favorite book since I read it my Senior year of high school and it's really the book that got me into reading. I honestly think the brilliance of Dostoevsky's character analysis is unmatched by any author since. The depth to which he was able to develop and understand his characters is unbelievable.Part of the reason I love this book is that it causes the reader to relate to characters who are repulsive when you take a step back, but Dostoevsky does such a brilliant job of keeping the reader engaged that you never get a moment and step back and realize what you're relating to. Before long, you understand and relate to Raskolnikov's casuistry. Perhaps the greatest feat of this novel is that Dostoevsky emphasizes that Raskolnikov is not in his proper state of mind and is sick throughout the whole story. Simply to develop such a deep character is merit for greatness, but then to understand him well enough to narrate his actions in sickness. That is incredible.I could write for ages about this book. It really will change the way you think if you let it."
"365",364,"anarki","The intense psychological pressure from Raskolnikov(Main Character) is something I can empathize. I feel like I'm Raskolnikov. I projected myself as him. His hysteric symptoms, hypochondrias, thought processes, suffering and disgust. Identification really played a big part here. To emphatize a murderer, and to find yourself to having that kind of capacity to do the same. At some very clear point, our minds meet. And I am not surprised. Every single time I watch the News from the Television and read from the newspapers, I feel the same way Raskolnikov felt for the pawnbroker. Pure, very reasonable disgust. To exterminate all the corrupt politicians and criminals(or any of that sort), one must shed blood. Skulls are thick. Words don't work. The violence is necessary. One life in exchange for millions. Would that hurt the world that much? Though violence was necessary, what kind of peace would transpire from it?Click here to read a faint literary attempt to save the worldRaskolnikov thinks that Napoleon was the greatest superman. He believes that Napoleon wouldn't have had a problem committing murder and that he would not be feeling any guilt at all over the matter; being able to accomplish goals for his principle and for the benefit of others. To commit crime by principle.The antihero, Raskolnikov, driven by that ideal suffered from tremendous symptoms. Even my stomach reacted when I was reading this book. If you would just step into his shoes, you'll somehow experience that mind-melting psychological tension.The book shows how dangerous it is to think of yourself as an Overman(as Nietzsche coined it) or an Extraordinary man(as Sir Fyodor coined it) more or less, they're the same. Those who where born extraordinary carry the burden of the awareness of such principle.In the end, would he submit himself with dignity and taking complete responsibility for whatever he had done?Conscience, to submit to it, is a divine attribute of the strong. And to surrender, sometimes, is the bravest thing a human being can ever do.Another thing, the way Dostoyevsky used Dreams in all his writings(especially in this book) gave me goosebumps. The dream distortion was vividly displayed for understanding. The mechanisms of wish-fulfillment and symbolism were really showed in each of his character's dreams. Freud must have been really influenced much by Sir Fyodor. Freud even stated that the book The Karamazov Brothers(Dostovevky's last novel) contained all Psychology and that it was the Most Magnificent Novel Ever Written.. I am now wondering why Sir Fyodor's books were not discussed in our Psychology Classes. I haven't even heard of his name. Seriously, how come?Dostoyesky's writings primarily deal deeply with the darkest corners of human nature. What lurks beneath our skulls, is it of infinite depth? Can human nature alone, possibly reach that extent of doing such things or was there a God-given impetus or something from a Higher source?"

But I'm further convinced that Dostoevsky was the first real existentialist (I'd only read The Brothers Karamazov and Notes from the Underground previously). I also would say that, given Russia's peculiar position in both ""East"" and ""West,"" it really makes sense how a brilliant writer like Dostoevsky can explicate modernist themes so effectively (but without the Romantic drivel or social realism of some of his European contemporaries)."

"373",372,"Karey","Dostoevsky is verbose, and I love it! I learned that there are women in the world who are so isolated from the world that they resort to screaming. It breaks my heart. It amazes me how he, and writers of his era in particular, were able to create such complex, interweaving threads with just the use of pen and paper. No wonder so many of them were such recluses. "
"374",373,"Miruna Orban","My first book from this author. Nice book. Really interesting.It was so exciting seeing how the main character turns into a ''dead'' one. It's a psychological book. Someone told me you have to struggle to read classic books like this one because they are boring but I never thought so while I was reading it. It wasn't boring. It kept you alive while he killed the two ladies and how he gets crazy.You'll always pay for your sins and maybe in two lives, not just in one."
"375",374,"Jekaterina Dmitrijeva","Dostojevskis ir cilvēka dvēseles pazinējs-eksperts. Turklāt grāmatā uzdotais jautājums ""Vai ir tāda cilvēka grupa (talantīgie cilvēki, citātie cilvēki), kam nogalināt ""nākotnes cēlo mērķu"" labā ir morāli?"" tiešām iesēžas domās. "
"376",375,"Matt Gough","Raskolnikov, an idealistic young student who believes that there are special individuals who can transgress moral laws in order to achieve greatness, commits two murders. One he has planned out, the other occurs when he is discovered in the act. The novel takes the reader through Raskolnikov's various mental stages as he comes to realize his mistake. After the murders, he immediately becomes sick, both a mental and physical illness. He struggles with the idea that if he was a special individual, then he should feel no remorse for killing the two women. Yet, he does, thus making him one of the commoners and thus making him a sinner. The novel gains complexity when Raskolnikov meets and falls in love with Sonya, a young, religious prostitute. One of the most touching scenes in the novel is when Raskolnikov asks Sonya to read the story of the raising of Lazarus to him. Raskolnikov wishes to be reborn, to return from the land of the morally dead. One of the great images of the novel comes from Hugo. Raskolnikov remembers a book he read in which a man would rather stand on a small ledge for thousands of years and live rather than die. ""To live, to live!!"" At the end of the novel, he has two choices (as Svidraigalov puts it), to either kill himself or turn himself in. Svidraigalov kills himself, because he cannot deal with the actions he has committed, which include the supposed murders of his wife and servant. Raskolnikov, at the end of the novel, turns himself in. In the Epilogue, we find Raskolnikov in a hard labor camp in Siberia; while he has had trouble dealing with his punishment, the last image the reader gets is him realizing his love for Sonya and kneeling at her feet.

"377",376,"Laura","I first read this in college and re-read it last year. I remember it as a quick and psychologically interesting read. It was interesting this time around, but it was also painful, like a gruesome car wreck that you do not want to look at. Good, but I don't think I will re-read it again for awhile."
"378",377,"Karen","I'm not sure which edition of this book I read, but I had to read it for ap english in high school (like everyone else). The day I got it, I read the first chapter--my assignment--and then all the rest. I never put it down. And then I read it all again as the chapters were assigned. I love this book."
"379",378,"J. Dunn","I reread this in the new translation, and in conjunction with the corresponding part of the Joseph Frank Dostoevsky biopic. It was the only major Dostoevsky that I hadn't read since high school. Robert Louis Stevenson said that reading it is like enduring an illness, and I think that's a pretty apt metaphor for what makes this book so powerful and important. He does such a masterful job of putting you inside Raskolnikov's tormented head that you end up enduring a goodly portion of his anguish and redemption in your own right. It’s not necessarily always pleasant, but it’s compelling nonetheless."
"380",379,"Lauri","This was a fabulous book, I cannot believe I waiting so long to read it. Very well developed characters - I feel like they are friends I will miss. Dealt with social issues still relevant in today's world, but much different that the British literature. It was a nice change, I was very pleasantly surprised. Now for War & Peace!"
"381",380,"Dawn","Sigmund Freud said ""Dostoevsky cannot be understood without psychoanalysis...he illustrates it himself in every character and every sentence"". Freud regarded Dostoevsky as one of the greatest literary psycologists in history, second only to Shakespeare. As a psychoanalyst, Freud attempted to unearth and identify the myriad of submerged voices and desires in the unconscience of his patients. Crime and Punishment mirrors this process by probing the multiple and often contradictory motivations in the mind of the lead character ""Raskolnikov""."
"382",381,"Alejandra","I read half of two different translations in Spanish of this book (the first book I received as a present had about 200 pages missing, so I went and get another edition to keep reading), and the translation makes a difference. Haunting exploration of the mind of a criminal quite sure of his intellectual capability. Raskolnikov is a very complex character, capable of showing kindness to a poor family, while plotting a murder in cold blood, just because the world deserves him. Wonderful book."
"383",382,"Locyan","today i was talking to my work colleague, she's like early 50's and extremely russian and i think a bit of a drunk. anyway we talked books and i was like 'I-, i'm jealous you're able to read things like dostoyevsky and watch tarkovsky films in the original language, it's total bullshit!' she did this nice giggle and smile thing she does and started talking about accidentally changing the settings on her new laptop because she was blotto and doesn't understand app permissions/security so she will probably bring it in for me to look over in my lunch break. that's cool by me we're kind of not busy at the moment. i am reading berserk manga in my lunch breaks but hey i do that all the time anyway. anyway this is a good book, first boring 400 pages are more than balanced by the amazing last 200 pages. probs the finest expression of existential writin' around. i like to think of myself secretly as a razumikhin but i may actually be svidrigailov? wanna make out with dunya. ciao"

"385",384,"Kaya","UPDATE: I'm done! I'm in withdrawal from gross, dingy 1860s St. Petersburg, Russia. This becomes one of my favorite books of all time. People never change. Some of the observations FD makes about annoying dickheads and whiney women are spot on. There are some scenes from this that are gonna stay with me forever. A couple Svidagailoff ones. Mean Pyotr Petrovich. That damn dream about the horse. I can't get over how many balls Dostoyevsky gets into play at the beginning and how he deftly keeps them all juggling around, some in the foreground, some in the back. Then he drops them at the perfect, craziest times! A stranger on a street. A knock on a door. The story takes place over a pretty short amount of time so it's easy to follow. It's also MUCH easier to read than Moby-Dick if you're looking to take on a 3-inch tall piece of classic lit.AND GET THIS!!!!!!! For those that don't already know, I am obsessed, OBSESSED with the TV show Columbo. It's in my top 5 of all time. So imagine my surprise when a certain detective enters into the narrative. Seth and I BOTH came to the same realization on our own: This dude is Peter Falk! Soooooooo once I finish C&P I am farting around on Wikipedia and wouldya looky there! Down at the bottom of the page it says how the creator of Columbo, William Link, based Columbo on the detective!!!!! Ha ha ha! HA HA HA! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!Spoiler:The epilogue is kinda bizarre. If it didn't exist I wonder if I woulda liked the book even better. It's almost a little anticlimactic. We find out Raskolnikov's punishment and it doesn't seem too bad. Though I suppose that's the point - that the internal struggle is far worse than anything doled out in Siberia. Right before the epilogue I was pleading, PLEADING! ""Please don't confess!!!!!"" So busted out in tears at the end of the last chapter. Gotta hand it to FD for making me have so much sympathy for a dude that hacks people in half with an axe.2/3rds of the way done. It just keeps getting better and blacker and Russian-er! Remember Dr. CHilton (Hannibal Lecter's old friend he'll be having for dinner at the end?) Well, that dude is narrating this audiobook and it is such a blast listening. He does all different voices (not in an annoying way). I especially love the old lady pawnbroker voice. And Marmolotov: ""Her stockings! Her STOCKINGS I have sold for drink.""I recommend to EVERYONE! I am so entertained! And so disturbed! There's a dream sequence fairly early on that is the single-most horrifying passage I have ever experienced. Ever. Might have been some tears involved. It ruined that entire day. But it's worth it!Doo it. If you start now you might catch up to me if you are a speed reader. St. Petersburg beckons!"
"386",385,"Harsha Varma","Crime and Punishment is a pulsating thriller. It is incredibly entertaining, extremely fast paced and a pleasure to read. I've probably never shared as much anguish at the plight of a character as I had with the protagonist, Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov (probably the best name I've encountered in literature). Would you kill someone if given a chance albeit that someone be a vile and evil person? I get all the greater good argument but can we really take someone's life? Can a good person get away with committing a vile act, especially from his own conscience? Dealing partly with these questions, Dostoyevsky does a wonderful job in showing us the psyche of a murderer. He describes Raskolnikov's turmoil exhaustively giving us an exact view of his tormented mind. He eliminates the ""who did it"" part of a murder thriller but the ""why did he do it"" and ""will he get caught"" part of the plot keep the reader intrigued. In my opinion, Dostoyevsky's greatness lies in the bond he establishes between the reader and his characters. I know I should probably be repulsed by Raskolnikov because of his appalling and disgusting crime. Yet, I can't. I actually like him and care for him dearly. I want him to escape from the clutches of the law, be free from any punishment. I want his suffering to end even at the expense of morality.There are so many places where the novel kicks up a gear and inches towards perfection. I particularly loved the build-up to the murder which had so many close calls as the protagonist makes a lot of impromptu decisions, showing his lack of preparation. The exchanges between Rodion and the police detective, Porfiry Petrovich( another alliteration) keep the reader on the edge of his seat as the detective tries to get a confession from the protagonist.This is probably the most captivating classic I've ever read. Dostoevsky’s ability to portray humanity so realistically is a testament to his genius. I am in awe and just can't wait to read his other books."
"387",386,"Lindsey Marsaw","Dark and depressing, however beautiful. "
"388",387,"Mitan","In my opinion, Dostoyevsky is unsurpassed master of the written word.His entire work fascinates me.""Crime and Punishment"" is realistic, psychological novel with social, philosophical and crime elements. This is a novel about a single human character. Facing the social reality, in the poor area of St. Petersburg, but also individual psychic reality of a poor student and his struggle to survive in desperate circumstances.The theme and the idea of the novel are contained in the title: the double murder that Raskoljnikov performs and the following punishment (more psychological than physical). That physical punishment contains the idea - the man is punishing and torturing himself more than society can does. There is no excuse for a murder committed, because every life is worth."
"389",388,"Martyna","For me, it is a masterpiece. I love psychological novels and this one was perfect.Although the book focuses on the crime, you cannot say there is nothing more. There is love, there is politics, there is the city.I highly recommend it."
"390",389,"Terry Lee","I finally finished Crime and Punishment. I should have read it in high school, but I think the reason I didn't was because that edition's translation wasn't very good. It was just too dry. Reading this edition went very smoothly. It held my interest to the end. Months go by between the crime and the legal punishment, but in those months you see that the legal punishment was no match for Raskolnikov's personal punishment. He suffered physically and mentally until you wish he would just give himself up. You feel his pain. I recommend this book to everyone who failed to read it in high school."
"391",390,"Dr Wesley Rose","I read this at a time in my life when I was somewhat disillusioned and had begun to question many things I had been taught. Indeed I was unsure how I felt about a lot of things. This book hit me particularly hard and made we sit back and examine myself as objectively as possible. It also opened a door into self growth and maturity. Crime and Punishment is much more, it is worldview. Give yourself the opportunity to check your reality and belief systems without paying a fortune to a Psychiatrist or exposing yourself to the criticism of some other stranger. The only stranger that may get involved is you - the you that resides just out of your conscious thought. Don't be afraid to examine your views, and please add this classic to your must read list. "

"398",397,"Flor","Cuando empecé a leerlo cada hoja se me hacía eterna pero es un libro que poco a poco te iba atrapando. Si bien se me hizo pesado, tengo que decir que cada minuto de mi vida que ocupé en leerlo no fue perdido sino que gané mucho porque es magnífico y profundo. Rodion Raskolnikov, como protagonista, es un personaje que por momentos odié y por otros amé, el camino de redención de él para mí es bastante contradictorio y puede abarcar muchísimos puntos de vista, o por lo menos así lo veo yo. Crimen y Castigo realmente es una historia que muestra no sólo el asesinato que cometió Raskolnikov sino los distintos ""crímenes"" que cada uno de los personajes a cometido, ya sea Sonia, ya sea Svidrigailov, y cómo cada uno de ellos tendrá su castigo. El sufrimiento presente en todo momento es como el hilo que ata entre sí a los personajes pero sobretodo el reconocimiento mutuo del sufrimiento se ve en la relación entre Sonia y Raskolnikov. A este panorama oscuro se le suma la descripción de una San Petersburgo oscura y desalentadora.Sonia es un personaje tan puro de alma que será una de las piezas claves para la redención de Rodion.Igualmente de importantes son Dunia y su madre que reciben todas las hostilidades que Rodion expresa por su nervios y estado constante de alteración. El dilema ético y religioso de Raskolnikov está lleno de idas y vueltas en su pensamiento, ya que, a pesar de que al principio de la historia dice que es por el bien de la sociedad que realizará el asesinato, su enfermedad y estado febril son formas en las que su sentimiento de culpa sale a flote y en las que parece que se entrevieran deseos de entregarse a la policía todo el tiempo pero no por tranquilidad sino como una forma en la que el protagonista busca limpiar su alma. Con respecto a los otros personajes, debo decir que Razumikin, el amigo de Raskolnikov, es mi favorito, porque en todo momento muestra su amor incondicional por él y una pura amistad presente en todo momento.Aunque hay muchísimo que decir con respecto a este libro, sobre la religión (la relación con Dios) por ejemplo, espero poder explicar la magnífica obra y que vale la pena leer, valió la pena el sacrificio de cada parte con páginas interminables y llenas de nombres impronunciables.Parte del final me sorprendió porque esperaba que algunas cosas no fueran así. Todos los personajes finalmente llegan a tener su ""castigo"" y es una muestra de que es inevitable que paguemos por los distintos ""crímenes"" o más bien dicho pecados o errores que las humanos cometemos en la vida."

"411",410,"Robyn Blaber","I have read a fair number of novels with a wide variety of characters and without fail, whether the character is anywhere from a young British girl to a tribal African chief, to a time travelling alien, I managed to find a way to identify with the main character at a certain level. Hero or anti-hero, I always seem to meld my own identity with our hero to empathize with them.What's unique about this book is that never for a moment could I empathize with Rodion Raskolnikov. I didn't like him from the beginning. When he committed his crimes, I liked him less and all the way through as he pronounced his judgements on the people around him, I liked him less and less. Whether he was right or wrong in his judgements, he never (to me) had the right to judge others, his own state being so deplorable.The novel itself was surprisingly modern. I looked up twice when it was written, both times not believing it. One character was talking about behavioral psychology, while another was talking about getting fat in his office job and thinking about joining a gym. A gym? in the 19th century? So, the nature of crime. Crime is bad. People who commit crimes must feel bad. People who commit crimes must be punished for said crimes. There is no... acceptable way to commit a crime, except perhaps to protest an unjust law (a topic not covered in this book).The rest is again and interesting period piece that takes you back to 19th century Russia and makes you a resident... it's time travel at its best. Very enjoyable from cover to cover, except for that damned Rodion Raskolnikov."
"412",411,"Herzog","I reread this during a recent trip to St. Petersburg. Sometimes classics that I've read long ago disappoint - not this. Though it was written back at the time of the U.S. civil war, it feels psychologically very contemporary. Dostoyevsky's portrait of Raskolnikov remains intense and chilling. I was fortunate enough to see the house that is supposedly the scene of the crime in St. Petersburg and, even these so many years later, I think that the book evokes the atmosphere of the city and neighborhood. I only wonder what it was like at the actual time of writing."
"413",412,"منال","أعجبني فيها دور الضمير في تقدم الأحداث، الضمير في داخلنا أكبر وأكثر تأثيرا من الوعاظ ونصائح الآخرين، الظلم والتعدي والانتقام أسرع الأمور التي يتردى معها الإنسان إذا ما استيقظ الضمير.. العيش الضنك بعد ارتكاب الجرائم في حق الغير هي الجريمة والعقاب.."
"414",413,"Bill Michaud","I'm currently reading this book during breaks I have in between classes. It's a great book, but at first I absolutely hated it. I couldn't see where the author was going with something that seemed pointless at the time. Right around the time of the murder though, that's when this book became much better (yes, he murders the lady, it says so right on the back, no spoilers there). It's been interesting to watch the psyschological break down of Raskolnikov.I may change this review slightly after I finish the book"
"415",414,"Lizbeth Hidalgo","No pensé que iba a amar tanto este libro, Dostoievski con demasiada razon eres el padre de la novela psicológica, la volvería a leer una y mil veces mas."
"416",415,"Steve Lindahl","Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky is a classic Russian novel I decided to cross off my “should have read in high school” list. It is, by today’s standards, wordy, but I expect wordiness in nineteenth century literature and I enjoy getting into characters with detail and depth. Crime and Punishment is primarily the story of a young student named Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, who kills an old pawnbroker and her sister for a variety of reasons. He is quite poor and becomes desperate when he learns that his sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is engaged to marry a wealthy man. Raskolnikov believes his sister is marrying someone unworthy of her for money and plans to help her family, including him, through their difficult financial situation. He thinks of the murder as an act that will rid the world of an unethical individual, but I saw this more as a rationalization than a reason for the crime. All this happens early in the story. The book is, for the most part, the story of his psychological reaction to his crime. Although the book centers on the murder of the pawnbroker, it is not the only moral issue covered. The novel includes the story of a drunk, Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, who dies, leaving his family in a desperate situation — Semyon’s daughter, Sofia Semyonovna Marmeladova , who turns to prostitution to help support her family — and Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin, Avdotya’s former fiancé who attempts to frame Sofia Marmeladova for a theft she hadn’t committed. All these stories show events that present moral conflicts, even if the actions were not technically illegal in nineteenth century Russia. And there is also, Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigaïlov, a wealthy, former employer of Avdotya who apparently murdered his wife, Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlova. So the plot covers more than one crime and more than one punishment. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys classics and likes to read psychological studies of human behavior.

"417",416,"Gautam","""If u want to know a person thoroughly, you must go slowly and carefully, so as to avoid mistakes and prejudices which are always difficult to correct or eradicate afterwards"" Rodion Romanovich Rosalnikov, a character that baffled and moved me to the extreme didn't want to get stuck in mediocrity. He was perturbed and furious because of various reasons. He was famished, people around him were idiots and poverty stricken and who live and die without leaving any mark, had to discontinue his education, his family's selfless sacrifice for his well being. All these disturbing reflections stirred the monstrous thoughts in him. He believed ordinary people and extra ordinary people have one thing uncommon. Extra ordinary people ""dare"" to do new things. He too wanted to ""dare"" and put an end to all his misery.""I deduce that all of them,not only great one's,but also those who diverge ever so slightly from the beaten track,those that is,who are just barely capable of saying something new,must,by their nature, inevitably be criminals-in a greater or less degree,naturally- Rosalnikov.""Rosalnikov was not a revolutionary, but he wanted to prove himself he was not a beaten man. He wanted to prove himself he was not one among the 'ordinary '. It is like murdering the vile old woman to test himself without any premeditated exactness about robbing or killing.He had his own views to explain his deed. Paragraphs from the novel that struck me the most on his motives and views."" I believe, by law of nature, people are divided into two categories : into a lower( of ordinary people) ,that is. Into material serving only for reproduction of its own kind,and into people,properly speaking,that is, those who have the gift or talent of saying or doing something new in their sphere -Rosalnikov""""A kind of theory,the same sort of thing which makes me,for example,consider that a single piece of wrong doing is allowable, if the chief aim is good. One single evil and a hundred good deeds!""""Power is given only to.man who dares stoop and take it.There is only one thing needed 'Dare' - Rosalnikov""""It is disastrous to have a broad mind without special genius """"Napoleon had a terrible fascination for him or rather, what particularly attracted him was the fact that so many men of genius had not heeded the isolated misdeed but marched straight over it,without reflection- Arkady Svidrigaylov to Avadotya Ranovna""Indeed it was a beautiful stifling and nerve -wrenching experience to know the pain and mental torture a murderer might experience. I have even thought if the very author himself have murdered someone to etch out the minute of details regarding the psychological aspects. The delirious talks, incoherent dreams, nightmares, path-less errands, social inertness, fear of being conspicuous.. all these minutest if details had been beautifully crafted in this poignant tale of a person trying to rise above the suppression.Crime and Punishment also explains us the suffering of the downtrodden people of Czarist Russia. It tells the story of a time where people are considered lucky to have a bread crumb every 3 or 4 days. It tells the story of people with shattered dreams and life. On the whole, it is a story that takes you to 19th century Russia with horse cabs, congested rickety houses and buildings, people with tattered clothes, teen girls in flesh market and not at school, hungry children and mothers begging in the streets. How lucky are we! We become sad of even most trivial of things. This is real life people. All the characters were unique and exceptional. They all will be etched into my heart. I was moved beyond senses. A true masterpiece. Dostoevesky is a indeed a doyen in literature ."" Go at once, this instant, stand at the cross-roads,first bow down and kiss the earth you have desecrated,then bow to the whole world, to the four corners of the earth, and say aloud to the whole world : 'I am a murderer ' - Sofya Semenovna to Rosalnilov""5 stars on 5! -gautam"

"421",420,"Abilio","O personagem principal, apesar de professor de línguas, é um homem extremamente pobre e que vive angustiado pela sombra de se tornar alguém melhor ou fazer algo importante. Ele divide o homem em ordinário e extraordinário, numa tentativa de explicar a quebra das regras em prol do avanço humano.Seguindo este preceito - fazer algo que mude a sociedade ou em prol dela - o personagem planeja, em meio a uma luta consigo, a morte de uma agiota e, finalmente, cumpre-o.Antes de fugir da cena do crime, porém, Raskólnikov também comete, a contragosto, levado apenas pela situação de surpresa, o assassinato de Lisavieta, irmã da velha agiota, pois ela havia visto o cadáver recém-assassinado no chão.Este personagem principal rouba algumas jóias, mas não chega a usufruir deste ganho, e sentindo-se arrependido enterra-as sob uma pedra.Após tal fato e seus desfechos, o romance relata de maneira detalhista os dramas psicológicos sofridos pelo autor do homicídio, toda a sua saga, sofrimento e arrependimento.Diversas histórias se desenvolvem de maneira paralela à principal, entre elas um romance da irmã do personagem Raskólnikov e as relações do personagem com Sônia.Apesar de investigar Raskólnikov, a polícia termina por prender um inocente que se intitulou culpado por uma razão pessoal (bem explicado no livro). Entretanto, o personagem por fim confessa o crime que cometera. A confissão deveu-se, principalmente, à enorme influência de Sônia, que, antes disso, compartilha com Raskólnikov algumas leituras do Novo Testamento.Por fim, Raskólnikov é preso. Porém, devido à sua confissão, arrependimento e ótimo antecedentes, sua pena acaba por ser reduzida a oito anos em uma cadeia na Sibéria. Durante tal período, Sônia, personagem que a partir de certo momento segue Raskólnikov em todas as situações, manteve-se muito presente, servindo até mesmo de mensageira a sua família em São Petesburgo."

"428",427,"Matthew Leroy","Personally, I would not be intimidated by the length of this book, or if you have heard of any spoilers. The psychologically focused epic exemplifies the role of guilt in someone who commits a crime. The interesting thing is that there are multiple characters, some of whom experience guilt, and some of whom do not, each who do ethically impure things. Of course the worst (if you are ranking these matters) would be murder, and Raskolnikov and his guilty ambivalence is the main focus of the novel."
"429",428,"Miguel Ángel Moreno","Varias cosas me gustan de esta novela y de Dostoievsky en general: la descripción de los impulsos incontrolables que dirigen a las personas, la variedad y complejidad de sus personalidades y lo absorbente de la prosa, que transmite una sensación de ansiedad permanente."

"436",435,"Lorelei Yang","Crime and Punishment was my far my favorite book in AP English Literature (loved that class). The character of Raskolnikov is both sympathetic and relatable. His murder of the pawnbroker, though heinous at face value, is a moral conundrum that Dostoevsky handles deftly and philosophically. Where other authors might have written a book about the concealment of a character's wrongdoing, Dostoevsky takes the opportunity to explore the moral and ethical questions surrounding Frederich Nietzsche's übermensch. Ultimately, Crime and Punishment is a literary success in terms of style, content and philosophy. The Pevear and Volokonsky translation (which was the one I read) is true to Dostoevky's original style: the translators have managed to strike the perfect balance between literal and stylistic translation.

"438",437,"Marco Caetano","Crime e Castigo pode não ser o melhor livro de sempre, mas é incontornável que se trata de uma obra de referência e por isso mesmo de leitura obrigatória.Raskólnikov é um jovem que, para dar seguimento à sua vida académica, foi viver para São Petersburgo. Órfão de pai, é com a ajuda da mãe e da irmã que vai subsistindo. Apesar disso, a sua vida não é fácil. O mau humor aliado ao mau temperamento passam a ser uma constante, aliando ainda a sua falta de disponibilidade para fazer amigos, o resultado é o abandono dos estudos.Dedica-se então a deambular pelas ruas, a pensar na vida e nos grandes ícones da história (como por exemplo Napoleão), revoltando-se com o mundo que o rodeia. ""Os fins justificam os meios"" é algo que parece dominar-lhe as ideias. Muitos são os dilemas com que a sua mente se debate, muitas as dores de cabeça e a consequência é o desleixo na sua imagem parecendo um mendigo. Em boa verdade apenas fala com Nastássia e Razumíkhin, uma criada do prédio que habita e um ex-colega de faculdade.Estas pequenas linhas, naturalmente não chegam para o descrever, porque é uma personagem muito mais complexa capaz de pensar o mal, mas também, quando menos se espera, capaz de ser solidário ao ponto de entregar todo o seu dinheiro a uma desconhecida em apuros, achando-se com capacidade para organizar o mundo à sua maneira.Conforme o titulo do livro propõe, haverá um crime ao qual Raskólnikov está associado. A morte de uma velha agiota e de sua irmã, vitimas de assassinato, é o colocar em prática desse plano pensado ao mais pequeno pormenor até ao momento de o pôr em prática. Mas a vida é cheia de surpresas e nem tudo aconteceu conforme planeado. Raskólnikov, sente-se fraco, delira, recupera, torna a delirar. Começou o castigo.A qualidade da descrição de uma personagem que já tinha lido em O Jogador, é aqui ainda muito mais evidente. Dostoiévski tem a capacidade de entrar na mente das suas personagens de uma forma que está alcance de muito poucos. É esse para mim um dos grandes pontos altos da sua escrita.Com Raskólnikov este trabalho é primoroso. A forma como descreve os momentos em que o seu personagem luta contra os seus dilemas sozinho, quando reencontra a família ou nos interrogatórios de polícia é sublime. Numa palavra: ""apaixonante"".Quando voltar ao autor, gostaria de ler O Idiota, por isso se me quiserem oferecer uma prenda...Por último uma breve,mas justa, referência para a excelente tradução da obra.

This book is so far the best novel I have ever read, and the intriguing thing is I do not know why!Perhaps its the nihilism in Raskolnikov's thoughts, or the utilitarian dilemma whether the fact that killing a wretched old hag would promote greater overall happiness justifies such an act...But again if you were napoleon on the verge of greatness only stymied by such an pest wouldn't you destroy it?... what am I thinking of, these ideas will drive me mad, the mere thought is ridiculous...yet why do they reside?! In the end we all have to suffer, only through suffering can we gain atonement from our sin. But suffering is not laying in prison for years to come...it is neither the psychological turbulence attributed to one's atrocities, nor the physical pain in all its shades and colours. The genesis of The brothers Karamazov best sum up suffering, much as hell, is simply ""the suffering from being unable to love"" a price that both Raskolnikov and Sonia have to pay in atonement."

"442",441,"Raven Wilson","Crime and Punishment delves deep into the human psyche. You become the main character, Raskolnikov, and feel his emotions intensely. Raskolnikov is an intelligent and extremely poor student living in Russia who murders a pawnbroker and her sister. As I read this I struggled to place where I stood on his guilt. Either way I of course think murder is wrong and should be punished, but what continues to puzzle me is if it was justifiable or not. I feel like I am constantly learning something new about how humans react to such a tragic crime every time I reread this book. Whether it was intended or not, I believe Dostovesky makes mental illness better understood through the character Raskolnikov. Obviously, something is wrong with him given that he premeditated the murders of the two women but you understand down to the most finite detail why he did it. Crime and Punishment is one of my all time favorite books. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in psychology, Russian literature and/or classic novels. "

"446",445,"Nikolaus Geromont","My initial response to Dostoyevski's powerful Crime and Punishment was that the novel had an unorthodox style compared to other literary greats of its time, something that could easily dissatisfy many readers not familiar to Dostoyevski's works. To name only a few oddities of style in Crime and Punishment, the most significant are that (i) about half the book consists out of pure dialogue, which occasionally obstructs the author from adding vivid descriptions of St. Petersburg in mid 19th-century; (ii) paragraphs may go up to four pages long, unbroken; and (iii) the book is charged with philosophical theories and deep character study. Above all, the novel is explicit and gruesome, vividly describing the poverty that reigned over the city, and also giving us the famous, grisly and finely detailed account of Raskolnikov's double-murder at the start of the novel. Crime and Punishment is an 'ugly' book, and it appears much too modern for its time; the writing almost seems to mirror the rotten state of Raskolnikov's mind, as well as the destitution and madness of St. Petersburg's slums. Then again, the book, amongst others, marks the departure of realism in literature, and introduces the theories of idealism in novels. Dostoyevski is obviously more interested in the study of the character rather than his surroundings. Crime and Punishment is a study of guilt. It is the story of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a destitute ex-student who commits a random murder for no apparent reason. From there on, we follow him through the slums of St. Petersburg, we watch him encounter friends and foes (however hard he tries to avoid all sorts of company). We also gradually see how his conscience and guilt start to grow near the end of the book (he initially felt no remorse for his crime), and finally, how he is forced to choose between either (i) suicide, or (ii) turning himself in, in order to destroy his swelling torment. We are given fine examples of both options throughout the novel (Svidrigailov's suicide comes to mind), and it is to our surprise that Raskolnikov eventually chooses imprisonment over suicide. By either ending his life or receiving his severe punishment, he could destroy his mental suffering. In the beginning of the novel, we, the readers, are confused by the killings, since it offers no reasons behind it. We are, however, eventually given a theory (crazy as it may be) as to why Raskolnikov murdered the pawnbroken and her half-sister, which serves as a huge explanation to the nature of the murder. But surely his environment, poverty and relations with evil men have also something to do with it? Raskolnikov loathes the evil nature of men and women, and sees this wickedness in almost everyone, most of them driven by greed. We have Petrovich, police investigator, who cares only for himself and his job, and brings many suspects of crime (through torture and psychological games) into madness. Then we have Luzhin, fiance to Raskolnikov's sister, obsessed with power and money (he desires marriages with destitute women not only to have control over them, but also because they only consume little money). Svidrigailov, on the other hand, is a morally crippled and disgusting pervert (and, it is hinted at, a pedophile). And finally, we have the pawnbroker, who, in Raskolnikov's mind, 'robs' money from the poor, and is therefore considered immoral. These four mentioned characters present the evils of different social circles, and are therefore a motivation for Raskolnikov to act against the cruel, crumbling (both physically and mentally) society. It is only in Sonya, a poor prostitute who gives all of her money away to her downtrodden family, that Raskolnikov sees a human being, and finally falls in love with. Crime and Punishment is a novel of great power and raw emotion. For me it stands out, along with War and Peace (albeit being extremely different to Dostoyevski's work), as the greatest study on the human psychology."

"448",447,"Maria Pallozzi","E' da ieri sera che avrei dovuto scrivere qualche parola su ""Delitto e Castigo"". Prima di tutto, come tutti i libri che per me hanno significato qualcosa oltre alla semplice commozione temporanea dopo averli terminati, questo romanzo è stato il Titano contro il quale ho lottato costruendo la peggiore delle barricate, issando una caterva di pregiudizi, mobilitando la noia e la puerile convinzione che fosse solo la storia di un delitto e di un castigo qualunque, che oltre al furore e alla vergogna del protagonista non avrei trovato un bel niente. Solo nomi russi, incomprensibili, irripetibili. Era capitato con Marquez, era capitato con Hugo, qualsiasi cosa mi avessero consigliato la distruggevo a pura inezia, se piaceva a tutti allora doveva essere davvero stupido, e poi si sa che il tempo è il miglior cemento e gonfia e irrigidisce i nomi rendendoli più grandi di quanto non siano effettivamente stati. Questo mi dicevo, e tuttavia volevo leggere il romanzo, perché è uno di quelli che ""si deve leggere"", tutti lo conoscono, tutti lo avevano letto per formarsi un'opinione. L'edizione del libro che comprai risale al 2006. Sono passati 5 anni pieni senza che io riuscissi ad andare oltre pagina 200. Sono tuttavia sempre stata certa che le cose arrivano proprio al momento giusto, che a volte coincide con quello più sbagliato, per permetterti di vedere oltre l'abisso che ti attanaglia uno spiraglio di salvezza e beatitudine. Così stavolta intrapresi di nuovo la lettura del romanzo, quasi ossessionata giunsi dalla prima sera a pagina 100. Al mattino dopo ero a pagina 200. La sera a pagina 350. Ci vollero circa 3 giorni per completarlo, molto meno per rendermi conto di quanto Raskolnikov mi assomigliasse. Questa è la storia di un ragazzo che vede il mondo diviso tra grandi uomini e pidocchi. I grandi uomini sfuggono alla legge, e per far valere le loro idee sono legittimati anche a compiere azioni cruente. All'inizio della vicenda Fedor ci fa credere che sia per la fame, per non pesare sulla famiglia, per poter continuare gli studi che Raskolnikov uccide una strozzina, e sfortunatamente anche la sorella della vecchia, che si trovò in casa durante l'avvenimento dell'omicidio, dopo circa 400 pagina sappiamo che lo fece solo per dimostrare a se stesso di poter essere un Napoleone, non un pidocchio. Ma nel doverselo dimostrare, e nel rendersi conto che avesse compiuto un'azione non di certo mastodontica egli cade in uno stato malsano di incubo, preda dei nervi e della malattia, a tratti infervorato e intrattabile e in altri mite e docile da esser penoso, ma sempre preservando i suoi modi arcigni e un senso di distacco assoluto dalle cose e dalle persone. Finché non fa la conoscenza di Sonia, una ragazza costretta a vendere il suo corpo per sostenere le spese della sua famiglia sventurata, timida e sventurata, dal viso angelico e infantile e dal cuore grande. Non c'è malizia in lei, non c'è disprezzo verso coloro che l'hanno costretta al disonore, è diciamo, la donna angelo e cammina vestita di stracci. E' quanto di più lontano dall'immagine di una Beatrice per come l'ambiente l'ha resa miserabile, ma ancora più per questo la sua bontà e la sua fede incorruttibile spiccano sulla lordura, contrapponendosi all'ateismo e alle teorie malsane di Raskolnikov. Sonia salva Raskolnikov, convincendolo prima a confessare il misfatto, e poi ad accettare la sua sorte, i lavori forzati, e soprattutto il pentimento. Non c'è un attimo in cui si dubiti che i due si amino e siano destinati a un avvenire insieme, ma è solo nell'ultima pagina che lui si rende conto che non ci sono altre alternative, e finalmente si spoglia del dolore e della vergogna di essere uno qualunque e decide di amare la vita, e Sonia. Ci sono così tanti richiami a ciò che sto provando che il mio cuore accelerava all'impazzata leggendo le vicende descritte nell'opera. E' una di quelle volte in cui ringrazio fermamente la mia buona stella d'avermi donato una passione tanto rara quale la lettura, di non avere a noia le storie d'altri che spesso nemmeno sono state per davvero. Questo romanzo sono sicura, mi aiuterà a cambiare, e a accettare la mia croce. "

Crime and Punishment is not a story of, ""Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive"" it is a series of erratic rides on the Japanese Shinkansen.

My mind is still panting from the read."

"453",452,"Sarah","What's to say that hasn't been said? It took me three attempts to get going at this, and I read it straight over a break from college, and then had problems interfacing with people in the real world. Powerful stuff. "
"454",453,"Lotz","I first read Crime and Punishment during my first serious reading binge. It was the summer between my freshmen and sophomore year of college. I was single, and working as a janitor. Sadly, I had managed to escape high school without a shred of literacy, and was beyond ignorant at the time. I had heard of the book, of course, and vaguely thought of it as a kind of companion to War and Peace. But when I opened up to the first page, I couldn’t have had less of an idea what to expect.I was stunned. No book from that summer ended up making a bigger impression on me. In addition to this work, I had managed to bluster my way through Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Freud’s On the Interpretation of Dreams, and Toltoy’s War and Peace. Needless to say, almost everything of value went sailing over my head. But when I put down C & P, I was at least left with the feeling of awe, and the certain knowledge that I had experienced something truly great. The raw emotional power of the book was enough for me at the time. Raskolnikov’s dream with the horse, his exquisitely detailed mental states that accompanied his murder and attending guilt, the suicidal hallucinations of Svidrigailov—they burned themselves deep into my memory.As a result, I’m much relieved that I took the time to go through this book once more. Now, many literature binges later, I have some hope of understanding what Dostoyevsky was trying to get across.It strikes me that Crime and Punishment, when evaluated as strictly a novel, is not necessarily first-rate. There is little actual suspense, as the reader is continually clued-in to what will occur through blatant foreshadowing. And Dostoyevsky’s characters would be downright cartoonish if they weren’t so tortured. The single-minded and obsessive Roskolnikov almost seems like a cardboard cutout in comparison to more balanced, nuanced, and human characters like Tolstoy’s Pierre. His actions are always just so, his thoughts always run just so. In a word, he is two-dimensional.But that’s the thing about Dostoyevsky: he wasn’t writing novels. His works are sui generis. His books are like intellectual playgrounds where he could allegorize and develop his philosophy and perspective. He uses the crime novel genera to explore the question of free will, sin, and redemption; he takes stock characters from French fiction and turns them on their heads, to reveal the underpinning worldview that they represent. In the longwinded conversations his characters indulge in, he explores political philosophy, the nature of goodness, and the purpose of human life. But unlike Plato’s dialogues, the conversations are not just vehicles. The personalities and actions of his characters illustrate the ideas that they represent, resulting in a plot that is part allegory, part philosophy, and part prophecy. Extraordinary as all of this intellectual play is, that’s not even the best part. Dostoyevsky’s emotional drive, his ceaseless insistence, and his powerful symbolism make his books moving in their own special way. One experiences all of the drama of Dostoyevsky’s own autobiographical journey: through utopian hope in human reason, to intense suffering and nihilistic despair, to biting scorn and isolation, and finally to peace through faith in the Gospels. Dostoyevsky knows, perhaps better than anybody, how important it is that one not only think ideas, but feel them. His books recreate this intense emotional struggle. Like Dante, he treads a course into the lowest pit a man can sink, into the highest happiness he can achieve."
"455",454,"Richard Houchin","A must-read for anyone interested in theories of ethics -- Nietzschean in particular. As usual, I agree with Dostoevsky's characters more than I agree with Dostoevsky's authorial interpretation or intended message."
"456",455,"Vikas","C&P is the brightest star in the galaxy of Dostoyevsky. This book states the mental trauma a youth faces after committing a murder. Throughout this novel he tries to defend his crime before admitting it at last. This book contains literature and philosophy of supreme class."
"457",456,"Russell","I'll admit, it took me a bit to warm up to the book, Raskolnikov was a bit off putting from the very start. But I am very glad I gave the book a chance.The plot is fairly straightforward, and though Dostoevsky dives off into side stories now and then, those same stories tend to make it back into the main plot at some point. Every character we met has his own voice, Dostoevsky's ability to breath life into his characters moved them from flat strangers into people that are recognizable and archetypes without being caricatures. These characters speak from their hearts and temperaments, and each different from the other.This isn't just a psychological thriller, this is a story of profound religions connections and ideals. Raskolnikov's crime merely sets the stage, the real story is the hearts and souls of the characters and Raskolnikov's long road to redemption. Among other things, this is a story about the pride that causes men to fall, and keeps them in that state, unable to admit to their own wrong doing and the wounds they have inflicted upon others and themselves. Loyalty, family duty, honor, the meaning of courage, despair, madness, broken hearts and contrite souls, Dostoevsky fits more themes into one simple plot line then I had thought possible, and does it so deftly I didn't notice until I pulled back and thought about the book. It's a long story, those Russians know how to write! But this isn't a deterrent in the slightest, in fact I found myself wishing for just a bit more at the end. Highly recommended."
"458",457,"David Darson","Brilliant piece of work about the inner struggles of a thinking man - an intellectual. I won't say much, lest I spoil it, but I will say this - read it before reading anything else. "
"459",458,"Dey Martin","I was deeply affected by this book and I am so glad that I read it finally. I believe it will stay with me for my lifetime. I see here on GoodReads that many people are still reading it and loving it every day after close to 150 years since first publication! Truly amazing. Fyodor Dostoyevsky has a wonderful style of writing. His characters are made so real and they are all-of- them certainly ""characters."" I was able to visualize each character clearly thanks to Dostoyevsky's explicit descriptions of facial features, hair, clothes, and mannerisms - sounds and even smells(!). I will write only briefly in summary about the book. This was my first truly Russian novel (in English translation) and this for me was also a learning experience about the Russian people of the time (circa 1866) and of their lives with a few things political, social and economical going on then sewn into the story. For the protagonist Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, this was a time of awfully dire poverty. I did have a little difficulty in reading it at first. The way Russian names work was challenging for me - as I suppose it would be for most non-Russians. The problem I am told with first names in Russian is that people use endless diminutive forms and also will switch from informal name to formal name frequently as it is in this novel. I went in without a cheat sheet or study guide but eventually learned who was talking (often in never ending pontification) to whom. I read analysis after elsewhere about the significance of Dostoyevsky's character names but that is over-analyzed IMO. Yes Dostoyevsky's characters can really talk - a lot. Raz as I call him, or Razumihkin, or formally Dmitry Prokofitch, delivers many times over [the mother of all monologues.] The police inspector Porfiry Petrovitch comes in at a close second. Russians of that time, I learned, seem to like to talk... (view spoiler)[ As I made my way through the novel I came across a chapter that at the time seemed to be superfluous. The chapter was the one about the wake dinner given for Marmeladov by his consumptive widow Dunya. Bor-ing! But as we all come to learn, the wake chapter was a vital part of the story. Its importance becomes shockingly evident as events unfold in subsequent chapters. Without the wake party we would not have learned of the shallow and despicable liar Pyotr Petrovitch is and of the mock trial he conducts to pin a theft of money on poor Sonya, or of Svidrigailov's chance spying of Rodya's confession to Sonya. Katerina Ivanova's death from consumption on the very day of her husband's funeral is a coincidental tragedy that also happens in this part. What is kind of funny though is that the wake is ultimately a disaster. Everyone gets drunk. It is funny because it is so much like a wake or two that I have attended with dysfunctional family. Moving on… The careful weaving of plot is what makes Crime and Punishment so masterful. But the interweaving of the lives of its players with Rodion Romanovitch that meet to form the whole of this tragedy is what is equally ingenious. From the accidental death of the broken down Marmeladov, happened upon by our highly intellectual and psychologically complex protagonist, to the murder(s), and the detective's pursuit of the murderer, and the interrogation of Rodya by Porfiry Petrovitch who eventually accuses him directly (Part VI Chapter II), to the death of the lonely and underappreciated Katernia Ivanova, the love shared between Sonia and Rodya, the battle for Dunya's affections, the suicide of Svidrigailov, the admission of guilt, and after Rodya's incarceration; the death of his mother and it all came together in a surprising and shocking yet satisfying way. Nothing given away, only hints at what may come: Nearly perfectly complete in the end. (Did anybody notice that there was no funeral for the pawnbroker Alyona or her sister Lizaveta Ivanova? Was there no mention of it?) This was Dostoyevsk'ys portrayal of a murderer - one with a complex profile who plotted and planned and executed, imperfect as it was - a robbery / murder - a grudge murder - that by sheer luck went un-prosecuted. And one that weighed so heavily on the conscience of our protagonist that he finally - even after learning of the death of the one and only witness that could have turned him in, Svidrigailov, went forth begrudgingly to confess probably only after perceived pressure from his sister and from the unspoken wishes of the saintly former prostitute Sonia, now chaste, whom Rodya deeply loves and of his mother too. It is interesting to note that Rodya hadn't a sliver of remorse or did he care that the wrong man, the painter, took credit for his crime. Maybe he was even jealous. In many ways I think that so many things Rodya does are just a way to get attention - that he was desperately lonely - and even maybe even it is a sadistic game for Rodya. He is terribly narcissistic of course. He was perplexed and he tried to rationalize that his murderous deeds if committed by Napoleon i.e., the storming of Toulon, would have been celebrated. Maybe he is also a sociopath. Razkolnikov's view of those around him was that of prince and pauper. But in the end he showed compassion for he asked that Razumihkin, his true blue friend, look after his sister and mother during his incarceration. I had a few favorite chapters. The scene when Razkolnikov is at wits end and goes to turn himself in at the police station to Porfiry (Part IV Chapter V) but it gets interrupted and thrown off by the painter's shocking and unplanned admission of guilt is one of the story's best. I was on the edge of my chair the whole time. I couldn't put the book down. The interplay between accuser and accused just loaded and oozing with tension as Rodya phases in and out of believing he is finished and Porfiry homes in on his target. This battle that Raskolnikov has within himself is ongoing throughout. He is constantly wrestling with thoughts of destiny, of good and evil, right and wrong and about his purpose and mostly about the injustice that is his miserable life. Sounds like a mid-life crisis to me. ☺Crime and Punishment is ultimately a story of love: The love of family - especially that unbreakable bond between mother and son and the love of one's own community - of one's fellow man; and of what one man Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov was willing to stoop-to to protect that. I give this novel my highest accolades. It is undeniably a masterpiece.  (hide spoiler)]"

"462",461,"Vivian","This book focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in St. Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash.Raskolnikov argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a worthless parasite. He also commits this murder to test his own hypothesis that some people are naturally capable of such things, and even have the right to do them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov justifies his actions by connecting himself mentally with Napoleon Bonaparte, believing that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.this book is well return by one of the most important authors in the history of lit."
"463",462,"Justin Yeary","A brilliant literary masterpiece. I can say it is definetly within my top 5 favorite novels, if not my favorite novel. Dostoevsky masterfully portrays psychology and raw emotion in this work of art."
"464",463,"Leonard","An idea possesses Raskolnikov. He believes there are supermen, Newton’s and Napoleon’s, who transcend ordinary men and women, who can act without moral constraint to judge evil and levy punishment, and to determine whether he belongs to this superior race, he kills the greedy and usurious pawn-broker. But unlike Napoleon in Austerlitz he doesn’t execute his plan coldly and tactically. Rather, he nauseatingly dreams his way into a double murder, the pawnbroker’s sister having returned because he tarried. And, the sight of blood terrifies him to the extend his hands could not stop trembling. He discovers that he isn’t upright or courageous, that he could not transcend the law, and that he is just a louse, a member of the inferior class. St. PetersburgCrime and Punishment showcases Raskolnikov’s contradictory actions and emotions and reveals a split psyche fighting for wholeness. He despises others but dreams about saving the world. After reading his mother’s letter about his sister’s misfortune, he sheds tears but also sneers. He gives the little he has to help the Marmeladovs but then regrets helping them. He kills the pawnbroker to prove an idea but takes her money and valuables. He avoids the head detective Porfiry’s questions in the first interview but in the second falls upon the man. The psychological tensions grasp the reader and move the story forward.Fyodor DostoevskyRaskolnikov’s punishment begins not in Siberia after the verdict, but immediately after killing the pawnbroker, his irritability, nervousness, suspiciousness, delusion, and mania tormenting an already fragile psyche, not allowing him to eat, drink, sleep, work or socialize, and pressing him to hide in his coffin-like apartment trying to curl up under his blanket, feverish and delusional and escape from reality. His conscience torments and implicates him even before the law does so. Only through Sonya’s help and guidance could he find strength to confess his crime. This novel’s conclusion reveals that Dostoyevsky rejected any social system that tries to replace the jagged path of life with linear reason and save people from their predicament. Although his moral heavy-handedness in Raskolnikov’s repentance and redemption seemed to scar the artistry of the mental battle, Crime and Punishment is psychological novel at its best. "

The intellectual discussions about whether killing can be legitimate, the almost Lady Macbeth feeling after the deed, the one to one encounters full of hints and unsaid threats or thoughts ..all were totally engaging and intriguing.

Also a powerful argument for human worth and dignity.Rating: 4.5-5 Stars. (Excellent)"
"468",467,"Matt Tyler","Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is the first Russian novel I have read. Perhaps my favorite genre to read is True Crime. However, I have not read many fiction books that center around a crime.Though there are only a few chapters in the book that are edge-of-your-seat suspenseful, I found myself gripped by Dostoevsky's exploration of the psychology of a killer. On the back of Vintage Classics' Pevear/Volokhonsky edition, the summary says that Crime and Punishment, ""implicates even the most innocent reader in its enormities."" I definitely found this to be true. Also on the back: ""It is a preternaturally acute investigation of the forces that impel a man toward sin, suffering, and grace."" Dostoevsky shows that people are complex. Therefore, their motivations, which drive them to do the things they do, are complex. Though the many characters with Russian names can make the book difficult to read, each of these characters are needed to demonstrate the complexity of motives that dwell within the heart of people.The plot of Crime and Punishment is moved forward primarily through the dialogue of complex characters. Adding this to the setting of 1860's Russia, some chapters can be tough to work through. However, those who persevere, I believe, will be rewarded with a beautiful novel dealing with the complexity of humans and their actions and their need for redemption.By the way, I am not ashamed to admit that I used Spark Notes to help explain some of the background to the novel. Readers might find it helpful, as I did, to read a few chapters and then check out the Spark Note summaries of those chapters. "
"469",468,"Denerick","If you are going to murder someone, you'd better confess to the crime quickly as the guilt will rapidly make you insane (Assuming you are a thoughtfull intellectual like the odd and complex hero of this novel) Or better still, don't commit the deed at all. A fascinating exploration of guilt, redemption and the degrading effects of poverty. It is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest novels of all time.Easily one of the best books I've ever read."
"470",469,"Erica Thompson","I would like to thank Dostoevsky for making me more grateful that in no point in the history of the world I have lived in Russia. I love the message and themes of this book. However, i did not love the amount of pages dedicated to nonsense rumblings. The book could be reduced by 50% and still hold the same message and impact. "
"471",470,"Colin Murphy","The most incredible book I've ever read. The ending nearly brought me to tears. I never expected such closure from Dostoyevsky."
"472",471,"Michael Battaglia","This is apparently the latest entry into what has inadvertently become an attempt to read at least one classic of Russian literature a year. I didn't plan it that way, but there you have it. My first exposure to this novel was as a senior in high school, my now sadly departed English teacher and I were sifting through the closet o' English stuff for one old tome or another when we came upon a box of this novel, which had apparently once been part of the curriculum. ""You'd like this,"" she said to my seventeen-year old self, ""it has blood and guts.""I don't remember being that bloodthirsty and I probably would have been dismayed that the blood and guts amounted to about five pages but considering that's five pages more than ""Silas Marner"" sported, the idea of ""any port in a storm"" might have applied.But what a mess those scant few pages of blood and guts create. Given the title and the event that drives most of the themes that reside here, you'd think that it was an early version of the detective story, a psychological game of wits between hunter and prey. And it is, to some extent. But like in Dickens' ""Bleak House"", the mystery stuff almost seems to exist as a side plot while Dostoyevsky deals more with the consequences and ramifications of the act itself, both internally and externally (mostly internally, as no one seems too broken up that the old lady is dead).The core of the novel concerns ex-student Raskolnikov, who decides one day that he's tired of being a poor student and he'd be a lot more use to the world if he killed some old lady and took her money, especially as she isn't contributing much to the world at large. Well, murder seems to be much like a certain kind of potato chip, as you can't do just one and before he knows it there are two dead people, which should be a problem except that no evidence exists to connect him to it, giving him potentially the perfect crime. All he has to do is stay cool until the police lay off, and not arouse suspicion at all, which should be easy as long as he's not stressed. Except, oh look, his mother and sister are here for a visit. With her jerk of a future husband. Maybe it would just be easier to confess.If this book was six hundred pages of some guy trying not to get caught for a murder he's already committed, it would probably be a tough slog but Dostoyevsky seems to understand that life isn't about one thing. In a sense the novel becomes a tapestry twisting in the wind, where some elements become more exposed than others depending on the chapter and the travails of his sister or best friend or the random family with the drunk dad and prostitute daughter are just as important as the main action. It gets a feel for the flow and rhythm of everyday life, of trying to exist putting one foot in front of the other, showing how life is hard under normal circumstances, and really hard when you've got some stray blood on your conscience. It's the weaving of the threads, as Raskolnikov stumbles through St Petersburg slowly unraveling while everyone feels bad that he's unraveling but can't imagine it would have anything to do with the two dead ladies. In that sense he becomes a figure wandering in the distance even when seen close up, a weighted shadow that pulls all the action in toward himself, even when he's desperate not to be seen. Except, as twitchy and slightly crazy, everyone is starting to notice him.It sounds more humorous than you'd expect for a serious Russian novel and what surprised me was how for a book that deals with weighty themes, there's a number of bits that are striking in their subtle comedy. When his sister and mother arrive, it's a moment out of a sitcom and his early interactions with the police are a thing of beauty, as he basically tells them that he did it, but they assume that since he's admitting he was the most likely person to do it, he couldn't be the guy. Yet it can turn on a dime and break your heart or horrify you. One woman's death from the end stages of consumption as she goes out of her mind and then basically disintegrates on the page is terrifying in how the book never blinks, focusing unerringly on her suffering in what amounts to a long camera take, revealing a number of people standing around helplessly while also coming together to see someone out of this world. Raskolnikov's interactions with card-carrying lady of the night Sonya are extraordinarily touching, including one brief flicker of a moment where she grabs his hands and you realize how alienated these two people are and how much they care for each other because of it. Even a lengthy scene leading up to someone's suicide is carried by an elegant and airy sense of finality, with Dostoyevsky weaving those giant blocks of text into something that feels almost minimalistic, and precise for it.But it's the murder and the handling of the investigation that's going to be the draw for a lot of people and the few scenes that feature Raskolnikov and smarter than the average detective Porfiry are exhilarating in their drawn out tension, as the two of them dance around each other in a game of ""I know that you know that I know that you know"", the detective fairly sure he has his man but without any way of proving it he's forced to engage in circular debates to try and trick a confession out of him. Meanwhile, Raskolnikov does things like talk about his theory on how ""great men"" like his boy Napoleon are allowed to do horrible things like murder useless people because it gives them a chance to go on and do greater things that only they are capable of (there's a great ""Hark: A Vagrant"" strip where Raskolnikov is confronted with an article he once wrote titled something along the lines of ""Murdering Old Ladies: An OK Thing"") and gradually becoming unglued while the police start to run out of suspects (amusingly, 19th century Russian policework does not involve just beating up people until someone confesses, although maybe that happens offscreen . . . someone does eventually confess, however).Some people may feel the subplots and other plots dilute the impact of the main event, although I think it all falls into the same weave. Still, there are moments where two characters are having a discussion that feels like a sign should light up above them saying ""This is allegorical!"" and for a good portion of the beginning no one is capable of answering any simple question without it turning into a pages long story about something that is probably didactic. Other people, myself, included, may have trouble keeping the main cast of characters straight. While it's a cliche that Russian novels are notorious for everyone having more than one name, that's totally the case here and a quick perusal of a character sheet may be necessary (and a continual refresher wouldn't hurt) as not only are people referred to by vastly different names throughout the book (often in the same scene) a few characters are fairly similar long names and sometimes it's hard to tell if you're talking to the suitor who's a condescending jerk or the one who's the potential murderer.But there are moments, especially as it barrels toward the conclusion, where the book feels like a pressure cooker full of trapped electricity. Where the screws are turned, where it seems that Raskolnikov is thisclose to giving in and confessing, or someone reveals something they've heard unexpectedly, where kindness comes from people who don't seem capable of it, where suffering is dismissed as part of life, and embraced as necessary to enjoy life. When the culmination arrives, it feels like a relief at having been so tightly wound for so long and in that sense the epilogue almost feels like a letdown, a peek past the end credits when the ending was perfect as it was. But to stop before that misses the point of the novel. It's not to see someone get punished, but to see someone suffer and in that suffering see them understand what they were missing from life. And in that realization understand that life isn't doing whatever you want but what needs to be done, a graceful acceptance that might deprive us of a visceral denouement but reveals something more purer: we're not alone in this, and if we are, it's our own fault. There's hands everywhere, and if someone can't be pulled down into the fire with you, they'll wait patiently until you have the strength to crawl out."
"473",472,"Felipe Rodríguez","Dostoievski puso la literatura y en un nivel casi inalcanzable, digna de ser leída y revisada, en crimen y castigo su novela mas ambiciosa donde ahonda en los rasgos psicológicos de los personajes, su miseria, su indefendible culpa. Esta novela es insuperable, el mismo autor supuso un punto en donde Raskolnikov no pudo llevarlo a las siguientes novelas que escribió después de esta. He aquí un libro importante para el universo literario que debemos leer para entender como diría Stefan Zweig el alma humana."

Nothing ever goes smoothly in one of this guy's novels. The implications of this novel though it was written more than a century ago still echo today as a major thread that corrodes our social health and fairness today. Life still sucks pretty badly sometimes."
"479",478,"Emilie","It's difficult to say in how many and in what ways I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I'll start by saying that it's one of those that I imagine the more times you read it, the more you grasp it and love it. While initially the three-tiered names of the characters can be elusive and confusing, you eventually catch on and become completely immersed in more than just Raskolnikov's addled mind. While much of the novel is spent running through the paranoia of a mind pushed to the brink and then consequence of murder, there is far more to the story that I did not know about and was not expecting. Indeed, I found the characters of Svidrigailov and Luzhin incredibly curious, and I often found myself wondering if they were truly as depraved as they initially appeared to be, or was it all in Raskolnikov's head? I cannot decide how I felt about the final few paragraphs of the novel and the turn in the character, which almost, ALMOST, felt like a cop out in a big-Hollywood kind-of way. Other than this issue, the story is intensely deep and emotional, and particularly the first half leaves you often cringing or gasping, and there are a few other scenes later in the novel which add to that feeling. Bizarrely, though, I have to confess that I did not feel much attachment to any of the characters, for they all had their qualities which made them, at times, very one-note. I have read that Dostoevsky writes in an idealist sense, and you can see that here, especially with characters like Sonia and Katerina Ivanova. Dostoevsky's heavy religious beliefs also come out to play with the progression of the story. However, the symoblism and imagery all remain vivid and apparent and absolutely worth the reading. It leaves you thinking for days beyond. I think I'd like to come back to it in a few year's time, and see how my thoughts have changed. So glad I've had this recommended to me many times over, and now, I pass that on to you."
"480",479,"Claudia","Well, this made me think, but that's a good thing, right? Raskolnikov frustrated me -- why did he do this? When would he confess? WOuld he ever feel remorse? My questions were all answered, and I made my peace with him. I loved the minor characters: Sonya, Porfiry, Dunya...I read the women's stories were added to this plot, and I appreciated it. The scenes with Porfiry reminded me of ""Law and Order"" at its best. What wonderful ideas were discussed and argued. I think Sonya will lead Raskolnikov to redemption, but as Dostoevsky says, 'But that is the beginning of another story.'"
"481",480,"Prateek","A temporal yet eternal classic. One sees Dostoyevsky at his best as he delves into the psychology of criminal and the notions of crime. The classic is a journey into the world of the mind. Reality spills into nightmares; dreams pervade reality. You rise and fall, see and feel, cry and chide with the characters. A must in all bookshelves especially the ones who love psycho-analyzing the human mind."

"484",483,"Sentimental Surrealist","It's sort of incredible how far off the rails Dostoevsky flies with this novel's last sentence. Up until that point, Crime and Punishment is an amazing book. Taut, suspenseful, and packed with memorable characters, it's a fun read that's faster than it's often given credit for; it's also, of course, written with the reader's brain in mind, dropping in moral dilemmas and philosophical quandaries with confidence and ease. Raskolnikov's nihilism feels so real, but so does his desire to do some good for the world, and so does his pull between the two polarized emotions. It's an astonishing work up until that very end, that very last line, but then Dostoevsky has to turn it into a message novel, at the expense of pretty much everything that came before it. The character shatters, the complexity vanishes in favor of an easy out.Still five stars, but that's just a free one. "
"485",484,"Alissa","I absolutely loved Crime and Punishment. It is a story about a murderer who tries to defy his conscience in order to surpass the law and prove that he is an extraordinary man (like his idol, Napoleon, who he believed was a genius, and therefore was not bound by societal restrictions). However, he ultimately realizes he does not fall into this category and that eventually guilt overrides will. I love how Dostoevsky shows that the true punishment of a crime is not one that society impels on us, but one of our own - the mental torment, guilt, and paranoia that is part of the human conscience. I found myself asking so many questions as I was reading, which was unusual because I knew who the murderer was just from the first few pages. One of my favorite things about this novel was the psychological game both Raskolnikov (the main character) and the reader go through as the side plots unfold and all somehow tie back together in the end. Every time I picked up Crime and Punishment, I was completely immersed in Raskolnikov's world. I could picture everything vividly and I felt like I was on an emotional rollercoaster throughout the story - hating Raskolnikov one moment, and feeling sorry for him the next. It was like a soap opera! This book is fantastic. I would recommend it to everyone. I hope I will read it one day in Russian, but I am so happy I chose to read it this summer."
"486",485,"Michela","Un grande, immenso ed incredibile romanzo. In “Delitto e Castigo” Dostoevskij riversa tutto il proprio genio il quale non verte solo sull’ambito letterario, ma si avvale anche di profonde conoscenze filosofiche, politiche, psicologiche e sociali.Sono molto orgogliosa di questa lettura; dopo un inizio zoppicante e complicato stavo quasi per gettare la spugna, pensavo “ma è possibile che questo tanto decantato romanzo sia tutto qui?”, non ho ceduto alla voglia che avevo di uscire da quelle atmosfere cupe e soffocanti e mi sono imposta di finirlo. Questa sensazione di costrizione alla lettura è però durata poco, anzi pochissimo. E’ stato impossibile per me resistere al richiamo febbrile di queste pagine che si sono susseguite con una curiosità e morbosità poche volte provata soprattutto in una lettura definita “classica”, niente di più sbagliato nel descrivere quest’opera!E’ una di quelle letture che non possono lasciarti indifferente, che volente o nolente una volta portata a termine ti lascia il cervello sottosopra e la voglia di rovesciare tutte le tue convinzioni per dimostrare che nulla nella vita è statico e inerte. In “Delitto e Castigo” si rappresenta la natura dell’animo umano nei suoi istinti più estremi, eternamente in bilico tra il bene e il male, fra giusto e sbagliato, dubbi rappresentati perfettamente dal popolo russo soggetto ideale per simboleggiare questa umanità variegata. Una girandola di ubriachi, pazzi, idioti, suicidi, miserabili e lussuriosi animano una fosca San Pietroburgo oppressa da un’afa che traspira attraverso le pagine e ti soffoca; evento chiave dell’intero romanzo è un duplice omicidio per mano di Raskòlnikov che avviene nelle primissime pagine e che vede come vittime una vecchia usuraia e sua sorella.E’ lecito uccidere una persona per fini superiori? Raskòlnikov, imbevuto di idee superomistiche, ne è fermamente convinto; parte dal presupposto che gli uomini si dividano in due categorie: quella inferiore( gli uomini comuni) cioè, per cosi dire, il materiale che serve unicamente per la procreazione di altri esseri simili a sè, e gli uomini veri e propri, aventi cioè il dono o la capacità di dire nel loro ambiente una parola nuova. In nome di questa differenza di genere, gli uomini di valore possono commettere ogni sorta di delitti e trasgredire la legge al contrario di quelli comuni che sono tenuti all’obbedienza e al rispetto delle regole. Ci porta l’esempio di Napoleone, al quale sono state perdonate le guerre, le stragi affinchè perseguisse i suoi obiettivi, è giustificabile tutto ciò? Chi ci da il diritto di giudicare quali scopi sono condannabili?  “Secondo me, se le scoperte di Keplero e di Newton, per qualche combinazione, in nessuna maniera avessero potuto divenir note agli uomini altrimenti che col sacrificio della vita di uno, di dieci, di cento persone e via dicendo, che impacciassero quella scoperta, o che si fossero messe sulla sua strada come un ostacolo, allora Newton avrebbe avuto il diritto, e sarebbe perfin stato in obbligo… di eliminare quelle dieci o cento persone, per far note le sue scoperte a tutta l’umanità”  L’introspezione psicologica è talmente profonda che è impossibile non trovarsi d’accordo con queste riflessioni, e sta qui tutto il genio di Dostoevskij che in mette in scena la rappresentazioni delle più intime e sordide pulsioni dell’animo umano. Ogni personaggio rappresenta non solo un carattere ma un’idea:Sonja, personificazione dell’amore; Svidrigàilov, lussurioso e abbietto; Razumichìn che rappresenta il buon senso e la lealtà; c’è la famiglia Marmeladov a raffigurare l’umanità più misera e sciagurata. La costruzione della trama è lineare e perfetta verso un crescendo di angoscia e disperazione. Il protagonista Raskòlnikov, attorno alla cui figura ruota tutto un mondo di uomini disperati, puri, gretti, meschini, oppure lucidi, perversi o giusti, è megalomane e spietato ma la sua enorme sofferenza, fa si che si senta pietà per lui e si speri nella sua espiazione.L’epilogo è meravigliosamente triste quanto ideale perché non c’è delitto senza castigo.Un libro che lascia turbati e scossi dalla profondità e verità delle vicende narrate, un capolavoro che tutti dovrebbero leggere e che non può lasciare indifferenti.Amo Dostoevskij, con tutto il cuore.“Delitto e Castigo” per me è stato una conferma nei suoi riguardi, per voi, se siete ancora dei profani, spero sia l’inizio di un nuovo amore."
"487",486,"Luciana Darce","A primeira vez que li Crime e Castigo eu devia ter uns dezesseis para dezessete anos, porque foi no período entre fazer o vestibular e começar a faculdade – o que só aconteceu no segundo semestre... – e foi paixão à primeira vista. Eu me lembro muito bem da sensação de espanto, fascínio e encantamento desse primeiro contato e devo dizer que numa releitura, a história não perde nada de sua força.Publicada em 1866 – um ano antes do primeiro volume de O Capital de Marx – ainda é um livro atual, que ecoa com nossas próprias crenças e experiências; uma obra-prima de um escritor que praticamente só escreveu obras-primas; grande mesmo entre os maiores clássicos que o gênio humano foi capaz de produzir.Além de tudo, ao contrário do critério de alguns críticos que parecem considerar que a qualidade de uma obra é diretamente proporcional à dificuldade de compreensão e hermetismo da narrativa, Crime e Castigo tem uma linguagem extremamente fluida, sendo acessível e aberto a uma miríade de interpretações. O fato de Dostoiévski ter escrito esse calhamaço às pressas, premido por dívidas e editores – e ainda assim ter feito uma das melhores peças literárias de que se tem notícia – é só a cereja do bolo.Agora conheça Raskólnikov, o protagonista deste calhamaço. Um jovem que abandonou os estudos (‘ex-estudante’ nas palavras do autor) a despeito de ser considerado inteligente – até genial em sua própria consideração -, vivendo miseravelmente num lugar e numa época em que essa é regra, não exceção.Raskólnikov vive entre extremos: neurótico em momentos, apático em outros, cheio de energia e planos e em seguida prostrado e deprimido. Enquanto caminha sem direção pelas ruas de São Petersburgo, coleciona outras histórias de tristeza – como a de Marmeladov, cuja filha foi obrigada pela madrasta a se prostituir para poder prover a família, ou a de sua própria irmã, Dounia, que se obrigou a trabalhar para os Svidrigaïlov a despeito do chefe da família assediá-la, uma vez que teve de pedir dinheiro emprestado a ele para poder ajudar o próprio Raskólnikov.Preso entre o desejo de ajudar, de fazer a diferença e sua própria incapacidade de levar a cabo um projeto, o jovem cria teorias que possam lhe dar a coragem de tomar uma atitude extrema, partindo do princípio de que o mundo está dividido entre pessoas ordinárias, a quem cabem as leis e a obediência e as extraordinárias, que não estavam sujeitas às convenções sociais.Sustentado pela convicção de que é uma dessas pessoas extraordinárias e após algumas tentativas frustradas, Raskólnikov visita a velha usurária Alyona Ivanovna e racha o crânio da velha a machadadas para então roubar seu dinheiro e com ele poder afinal ser o altruísta a que aspirava.Não demora contudo para que Raskólnikov perceba que não é uma pessoa extraordinária a quem tudo é permitido ainda que suas intenções sejam boas. A culpa é esmagadora o suficiente para que ele adoeça, chegando à beira da loucura, até encontrar expiação através de Sonia, a filha prostituta de Marmeladov.A despeito do homicídio de Alyona (e da irmã desta, que chega em momento inoportuno), Raskólnikov é genuinamente bom. Ele tem suas muitas falhas, inclusive de caráter, e é ridiculamente ingênuo, mas a despeito do sangue em suas mãos, ele é inocente.Não inocente do assassinato que comete, claro – e pelo qual tem de assumir a responsabilidade ou perder a própria sanidade -, mas inocente do mundo. Dostoiévski criou nele um personagem que é contraditório, crível e com que somos capazes de nos identificar a despeito de seus feitos, de seus crimes.E não se trata apenas de Raskólnikov. De uma forma geral, todos os personagens do romance têm sua importância, seu momento de triunfo – e suas próprias tragédias. E, se não há finais felizes, resta ao menos esperança."
"488",487,"Jukang Liwayway","As a Dostoevsky virgin, my mind & soul was thoroughly pounded, lacerated, and left gaping open. It's a long journey with Raskolnikov, but one that I never found dull. "
"489",488,"Steven","If you have never read Russian literature, prepare yourself. Yes, the names are tricky, but get over it. Fyodor gets you wrapped into the World of the main character and you really do feel like you are going to go crazy by the end of the book. It's a fun read if you take the time to enjoy the mind games that are played with you, the characters, and the Russian people."
"490",489,"Jason Reeser","This is my all time favorite book ever. I've read it three times, and I have never found a book so compelling. Yes, the main story of murder is interesting, but it is the rest of the story that really catches my attention. Sonia, her family, and Raskolnikoff's need for redemption are wonderful."
"491",490,"Graziano","Crime and Punishment by Fyodor DostoevskyAudio CDPublished 1991 by Audio Adventures (first published 1866)“Life had stepped into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out in his mind.” (Epilogue)Raskolnikov is born in Dostoevsky’s mind and he’ll become the image of the modern hero (or the post-modern hero). Beyond the Romantic hero, where individual thoughts (forgetting faiths, religions, etc.) leads toward winning results; Raskolnikov’s character is beyond the will of power, beyond the good and the evil, he is looking for life without theories. Crime and Punishment’s alchemy: Dostoevsky gathers together his characters to create a scene where people, like chemical substances, react involving a transformation. Crime and Punishment reflects the classical elements: Earth, Water, Air, and Fire.An idea: Raskolnikov is the image of the Earth; Sonia suggests Water; Razumihkin Air; and Crime Fire.Crime working as Fire is an element that destroy, change, and it’s the root of a new life. Razumihkin is the element who brings freshness to the other characters, and works like the air intruding in a stifling room. Sonia suggests water , more heavy than air. Like Razumihkin Sonia brings cleanness, and works like the water of a river carrying Raskolnikov towards a new life (as before, without theories).Raskolnikov reminds Earth: Dostoevsky was an adherent to the current ‘pocvennicestvo’ (a word coming from ‘pocva’, which means soil or earth). The main idea of pocvennicestvo was the bond between pocva / earth and Russian people; a bond with the return to popular principles rooted in the soil. "

"493",492,"Scotty","This book should be a rite of passage for everyone at that coming-of-age point in their life. It reminds you to hold back the reins of your ego, because you're not as important as you might think you are.I'm grateful that I encountered this book as a teenager. As an adult, it'd just be weird. That's how I felt reading Camus and Hugo. Like I was ten years too old to be listening to something so petty and childish."
"494",493,"Dumpling","Probably the best book I have ever read. Although it's nearly impossible for an avid reader to pick a favorite, I would say this one certainly sits very high at the top of my list. Yet another epic tale of sin and redemption, this one keeps you on the edge of your seat. I read it in college and I remember not wanting to even go to sleep. Just wanted to keep reading! It's extremely detailed and fluid, so vivid that you can actually visualize the scenes as they take place. Makes a very strong emotional impact. For anyone who is a lover of books I recommend reading this at some point in your lifetime. "
"495",494,"julieta","Dostoievski es lo maximo!!! Tengo que darme el tiempo para escribir una reseña en forma, por ahora acabo de terminarlo y estoy conmovida y emocionada. Es increíble lo moderno que es, al final el héroe de el libro empieza por asesinar a dos personas sin arrepentirse, y de ahí todo lo que ocurre es Dostoievski en su más puro estado, lo amooooo!! (Tengo que escribir algo más tranquila, estoy cansada y es medio tarde, así que mejor me voy a dormir!)"
"496",495,"Angelli","Immoral deeds doesn't always guarantee the decimation of a person's overall moral fiber. The bad act itself is the definition of what exists or had existed. General forgiveness is never guaranteed for the offender, but sympathy goes a long way. It always amazes me how violence begets such an optimistic twist. We all screw up, some worst then others, it just sucks to be the victim because you can't screw up like the guy who screwed you over and then be forgiven or sympathized. Plus, this translation is pretty solid!"
"497",496,"Eccentrika","Bellissimo!!! Un libro che offre tantissimi spunti di riflessione e che mi ha lasciato carica di emozioni contrastanti. E' stata una lettura quasi dolorosa, divorata con brama, e dalla quale non riuscivo a staccare gli occhi! Il finale prima dell'epilogo è stato un colpo al cuore, da una parte ci sono rimasta malissimo, è il primo Dostoevskij che leggo e l'avrei preferito più cinico e cattivo. Ciò nonostante questo romanzo è un capolavoro!!!"
"498",497,"Benjamin Plume","I read perhaps six other books between starting and finishing this one, but not because it was a slow read. It called for no distractions. The characters all have flaws, and rationalize them away as virtues. They aren't the cliched ""tragic flaws,"" either, making very real characters. Dostoevsky is impressive in his demonstration of the merits and downfalls of various philosophies."

"501",500,"Susana"," Crime and Punishment  makes thinking about philosophical puzzles fun: can an evil deed be evil if it leads to a greater good? Should the insane be held accountable for their actions? I'd put this in the top ten novels I've enjoyed reading; it's fantastic.I didn't give the novel 5 stars because I wish the epilogue didn't exist. I feel that it simplifies the novel's resolution, and mostly takes away from Sonya's character. (view spoiler)[ I love how, at the end of the novel, Sonya asserts herself over Raskolnikov. She refuses to be emotionally and verbally bullied by him and commands him to his salvation/confession. She becomes one-dimensional in the epilogue when she follows him to Siberia because she treats all criminals with the same compassion. I wish he'd have left us simply with the knowledge that, by the end of the novel, she'd gained independence. Instead, the epilogue renders her into pure goodness and selflessness and takes away some of the sad, dark and beautiful sides to her.  (hide spoiler)]"
"502",501,"Lee","This has been my favorite book since I was 17. It won't speak to everyone, and I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. The main character, a poor student living away from his family in the city, is driven by destructive hubris and acts on impulses that feel very real to me. Even as a teenager, my heart ached for him and even more so now when I recognize how long lifetime regrets really last. His lapses in judgement change the course of his life, but love redeems anything and everything. "
"503",502,"Yuliya Babayan","I don't recommend locking yourself in a room and reading this until you feel as though the walls are closing in on you. Yes, it was uncomfortable to get through. All of the characters present a dark air of morose shame. They all lack dignity and awareness in empathy, sympathy, direct and naturally understood human tendencies. But in the end, its that darkness, hidden in between the characters own understanding in their self destruction, that creates an all too questionable tinge of familiarity."
"504",503,"Naya","One time, I had a boyfriend who became obsessed with this book. He grew a beard and started carrying an axe around. I was a little worried, but it was wintertime and my house had two fire places and he cut a lot of wood for me."
"505",504,"Jen Six","I loved this book by the first chapter, back in my senior year, because instead of the tired who dunnit set up in novels, here you have the lead character, basically explaining that he is the murderer of this story and he's going about things afterwards, trying not to be caught. I remember thinking, how friggin' intelligent this guy, to write the story this way. All I can say, is even if the names throw you off and the length, it's one of those books that once you've read it to the end, you won't have regretted it. I had to read it for school, but I ended up loving doing the homework for it because it had me totally entranced the trials this man went through. An awesome read and one I will share with my son. "
"506",505,"Dave","Taxi Driver, The Catcher in the Rye, and Black Swan all chronicle the main character's descent into madness. However, Crime and Punishment is the best of the lot. I love the way Raskolnikov rationalizes his increasingly indefensible actions. "

"508",507,"Chris","aside from the crime in question, there isn't much action in this book. it's a study of internal guilt, consisting mainly of raskolnikov's inner monologue. and it's a mark of dostoevsky's skill that 'crime and punishment' is still riveting."
"509",508,"Garima Kapila","Dostoyevsky reveals the possibility of inducing a moral nature in even the worst crime committers, who are also humans themselves. I was intrigued when reading how a character's jail sentence was reduced from serving lifetime to merely a few years. This book was eye-opening and made me question whether or not we ought to value rehabilitation over retribution of the imprisoned, and what is truly the most productive/optimized option for society in general, which is to balance both aspects of punishment."
"510",509,"Liddy","I read this book like 8 years ago in high school and love it. I had to put it up b/c it's one of my favorites. I'm a realistically happy person, but I love the character development, the irony, the sadness, and the misery of it all. Must read."
"511",510,"Keith","After finishing this classic I was saying to myself when is the next book that tells me what happens later. And then it hit me that this was written in the 1800s. Great book that has endured time. "
"512",511,"Kirsten","I just re-read Crime and Punishment, but this time I read the translation by Pevear and Volokhonsky. They are award winning translators for a very good reason. I appreciate their footnotes, explaining what is lost in translation--particulalry play on words, use of rhyme and significance of names. "
"513",512,"Abby","I loved this book. I had to read it over the summer for a course I'm taking, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Dostoyevsky follows Raskolnikov's moral journey as he deals with the repercussions of his arrogant crime, but not in an overly preachy or even emotional way. That objectivity in the face of an incredibly complex dilemma allowed Dostoyevsky to establish themes in all of the book's many layers, and I am positive that my class's discussion of it hardly scratched the surface of all there is to glean from this amazing work!"
"514",513,"Mark Bacon","Two women are hacked to death with an axe and some valuables stolen from their apartment. The killer, Rodion Raskolnikov, is at first trapped in the apartment when two men knock at the door and refuse to go away. After a suspenseful few minutes Raskolnikov manages to escape unseen. The mystery then becomes not who did it, because most of the book is written from the killer’s point of view, but which of two forces will ultimately be his undoing, the police or his dark, deranged mind that leads him to alternately wander the streets at night or hold up in his claustrophobic apartment while suffering fever, fainting and fantastic dreams.After the murder, which takes place in mid-nineteenth century St. Petersburg, Russia, Raskolnikov’s mother and beautiful sister Dunya arrive from the country followed by the sister’s manipulative fiancée who Raskolnikov insults at their first meeting. Raskolnikov’s sister is also pursued by a lecherous former employer bent on having Dunya one way or the other. Soon a casual alcoholic acquaintance of Raskolnikov dies and sends his family into hysterics while the drunk’s self-effacing daughter, who has become a prostitute to support the family, catches Raskolnikov’s eye.In this edition’s foreword, translator Richard Pevear compares the book to the Hindu parable of the blind men describing an elephant each by touching a different part, and indeed the subplots mentioned above head in different directions all held together by Raskolnikov. So rather than explore all of Dostoevsky’s complex characters, his overlapping themes, historical and literary allusions, let’s look at the book simply as a murder story.Even though we know whodunit, the murder investigation and the exploration of Raskolnikov’s psyche is anything but straightforward. A handsome young man in his early 20s, Raskolnikov is an impoverished, sickly former law student dressed in rags. He lives in a garret or tiny flat and is afraid to run into his landlady because he’s behind on the rent. He develops a scheme to kill and rob an elderly pawnbroker which he does early in the novel. He also kills the pawnbroker’s sister who drops in unexpectedly. The crime accomplished, the majority of the book focuses on the punishment which takes place largely in Raskolnikov’s head.While he may regret the crime for what it may cost him, he doesn’t regret taking the life of someone he considers worthless. Getting rid of the miserable crone was a favor to society. The sister simply became, in modern vernacular, collateral damage. Taking a view that separates mankind into the “ordinary and the extraordinary” Raskolnikov feels he is above most men and that the extraordinary ones may transcend conventional morality if the betterment of society is at stake. As it quickly becomes obvious, Raskolnikov is far from a level-headed polemic. Either his wacky moral beliefs are not enough to assuage his seeping guilt, or he’s on the verge of madness and all bets based on logic--even a twisted one--are off. As mentioned, he wanders the streets having extended conversations with himself about his crime, his pursuers and a strange notion that since he’s committed a crime he is now free to do good deeds for others, for society. But even when he donates some of his limited money, he seems to reinforce his appearance of derangement.Hot on Raskolnikov’s trail is Porfiry Petrovich, a police detective who seems to understand the complex psychological aspects of the young man’s motivations. A pudgy official of 35, his method of dealing with Raskolnikov is essentially to give him enough rope as the crime cliché says, but perhaps this method was not as commonplace when the book was published in 1866. In a masterful scene slightly beyond the halfway point of the book, Raskolnikov is summoned to Petrovich’s office where the detective lays out, in theoretical terms, what a perfectly solved murder case might involve, while he professes to be an awkward investigator.“…suppose there is evidence sir,” [he tells Raskolnikov] but evidence, my dear, is mostly double-ended, and I am an investigator and therefore, I confess, a weak man: I would like to present my investigation with, so to speak, mathematical clarity; I would like to get a hold of a piece of evidence that’s something like two times two is four! Something like direct and indisputable proof! But if I were to lock him [a suspect] up at the wrong time--even though I’m sure it was him--I might well deprive myself of the means of his further incrimination.”Petrovich even admits his interrogation techniques are clumsy, but he uses a telling metaphor.“Tell me, really, who among all the accused, even the most cloddish peasant doesn’t know, for instance, that they [investigators] will first lull him with unrelated questions (to use your happy expression) and then suddenly stun him right on the head, with an axe…”Again talking theoretically, Petrovich tells Raskolnikov that in some cases letting a suspect think that he knows his inner secrets and that he, the suspect, is being followed day and night will push the suspected person into making fatal mistakes.Although Petrovich seems to be talking abstractedly, his message unnerves Raskolnikov to the point where he tells himself he’d like to “hurl himself at Porfiry and strangle him on the spot.” Near the climax of the scene, Raskolnikov pounds his fist on the table and shouts, “Don’t taunt me! I won’t have it!”The case against Raskolnikov is not assured, however, compounded by another person’s confessing to the crime and the possibility that Raskolnikov may be completely loony so that the “cat and mouse game” (Petrovich’s words) proceeds with unexpected turns throughout the novel.If anything in this book sounds familiar, it’s because mystery and suspense writers have had nearly 150 years to read Dostoevsky and benefit from his insights, copy his style or simply lift ideas. The book is filled with what has become standard detective story fare: the killer returning to the scene of the crime, a protracted search for the best place to hide the loot, paranoia over being followed, frantic attempts to remove all blood stains, confiding the crime in secret to a girlfriend (a hooker with a heart of gold), the criminal’s belief that he’s somehow entitled to his plunder and a detective seeking a confession. Petrovich’s roundabout interrogation of Raskolnikov sounds remarkably like the bumbling yet savvy Lieutenant Columbo (Peter Falk) from the TV series of the 1970s and 80s.It would be a mistake to call this the original hardboiled detective book, but the mood and the settings are decidedly grim. The characters populate cramped, oppressive rooms decorated with faded, pealing wallpaper and frayed furniture. Many are dressed in ragged clothes, have little or no money and, with a few exceptions, bleak prospects. Suspicion, shame and fear are common and the dirty city streets are filled with falling-down drunks. One particularly dark scene describes a horse being beaten to death in the street in front of cheering onlookers when it fails to pull an intentionally overloaded wagon.Raskolnikov’s extended, abstract inner dialogs can become a little mind-numbing, and complicating the read is the custom of Russians to be called by their last names sometimes, or their first two names, or sometimes a nickname. Within the same paragraph a character can be referred to by several different names--a challenge to English-speaking readers. These issues aside, it’s easy to see why this novel is a towering classic. It’s a powerful story, with complex characters, a strong emotional--and intellectual base--and an engrossing blueprint for the crime novels that followed it.----------E-book notes This print version of the novel has many useful footnotes explaining aspects of Russian culture and language, historical and geographical references, plus relevant elements of the author’s background. It also contains a foreword by one of the two renown translators and a useful character list with a guide to pronunciation of the names.This novel also appears in an e-book collection of all of the author’s work, translated by Constance Garnett, that was available for the Kindle. All of the novels were combined in the file, making the percentage read gage and word search all but useless. According to the Amazon Web site, Dostoevsky’s books, also translated by Garnett, are now available separately--and free.Cinema notes According to imdb.com, there are no fewer than 30 Crime and Punishment films, many produced in other countries. The most recent US production was a 2002 film starring Vanessa Redgrave, John Hurt and Crispin Glover. A 1935 version starred Edward Arnold as Porfiry Petrovich and Peter Lorre as Raskolnikov."

"521",520,"Betty Ho","“Classics” is a big word for artworks that are widely recognized by expertise, in another words, amateurs need to be educated before they can fully appreciate it. Russian literature classics are especially the case as they have a reputation of being “long and boring” (probably a reputation gained from “War and Peace”). Therefore, it took me certain amount of courage to start reading Dostoyevsky and I’m glad I did.“Crime and Punishment” is a “classic” that most people can understand and enjoy. It is a psychological thriller of how a murderer struggled with his conscience. Dostoevsky told us that nothing could defeat conscience, not reasons, not laws and not even God. No matter who you are and how “logical” your action was, conscience will haunt you until the ultimate redemption. The “I know you know that I know you know” mind game between Raskolnikov and Zamyotov was intriguing. Yet, the psychological transformation of our hero (or anti-hero) Raskolnikov is just incredible. Those years of exile in Siberia didn’t break Dostoevsky but only enriched his experiences. "
"522",521,"Maximilian","Jag tyckte att det var en väldigt intressant bok. Det är en fascinerande resa genom Raskolnikovs ångerfulla resa efter att ha begått ett mord. Boken är väldigt lång, men värd all den tid den tar. "
"523",522,"Kasper","Extraordinarily well done in every way. In turn highly dramatic and phenomenally suspenseful. I find it difficult to decide whether this or 'The Brothers Karamazov', both of which offer exciting story lines and unforgettable characters, is the greater literary achievement by Dostoyevsky. But of the two I'd say that this is the more easily accessible."
"524",523,"Sevy","Un capolavoro assoluto!E' lungo, in varie parti è pesantissimo, ma superati gli ostacoli diventa un libro fantastico.Consiglio a tutti di non saltare lo scritto finale di Pasolini (non so in quali edizioni è presente..) che è interessante e aiuta a comprendere meglio la psicologia del protagonista principale.Poi, che dire...è bellissimo. Non posso far altro che ringraziare infinitamente l'amico che me l'ha regalato!"
"525",524,"Stuart Field","Incredible. Features the most realistic murder scene of all time and then explores the nature of good and evil and Nietzschen ideas of the superman. By the end it's beautiful and heart-breaking. "
"526",525,"Fatin","It is not often that a great work lives up to its hype, but this book, God, this book is absolutely brilliant. This is hardly a book about the story. The simple plot of which, could have easily fit in a mere hundred pages, or maybe even less. Instead it explores human psychology, the inner workings of the mind of a criminal, of a man who doesn't necessarily think like the rest of us.I did not take to the characters immediately, but I do feel a connection to Raskolnikov (our protagonist,) I don't particularly agree with him everywhere, and he is specially insufferable, but when he says something that I do agree with, it hits all the right points.As for the women in this book, they are very powerful. They have a quiet strength, and the moments when this strength is shown were possibly my favourites.The characters that bothered me the most were the police, namely Porfiry. From a standpoint view, Raskolnikov's idea of his crime doesn't bother me in the least: it wasn't a human being I killed, it was a principle!But how can the very people who are supposed to be focused on helping the public, concentrate more on the criminals themselves? What is this idea of letting a criminal run loose, because then he will make a mistake at some point and bam, you'll have him for good. Yes, you'll have the criminal for good, but isn't it the victims that should matter more? In fact this seems to be a theme in the book. Nobody gives a shit about any victims of any crime.•	I no longer suck at the pronunciation of Russian names. (Okay, that's a lie, I suck less.)•	I now more firmly believe that the more intelligent you are, the more miserable you will be, unless something as fleeting, or perhaps as powerful as love makes itself known to you.•	Lessons learned. ALWAYS, ALWAYS pick up a Pevear and Volokhonsky translation."
"527",526,"Umang","It’s a hard book to review. The reason being it’s written so intellectually, that one would need to re-read it over a period of time. And every time you do that, it won’t fail to refresh your outlook towards the human character or existentialism. You are missing out on some fantastic work if you have happened to ignore this writer and his books. The story primarily focuses on Raskolnikov, a young student who murders his old pawnbroker and then gets spiraled into suffering, mental trauma eventually leading to confession and redemption. However, the book has so much more. I felt that the way the supporting characters crawl from being really external (to Raskolnikov and to his mind) on to becoming an integral part of the entire story, has been beautifully brought by the writer. Porfiry and Raskolnikov’s interactions never failed to provoke, absorb and mentally stimulate me. And neither did the commentary, the conflicts within a person’s mind. So accurate, rich and well written. The story is simple, yet not so easy to imbibe.What I really failed to understand from the climax was that Raskolnikov ends up confessing, considering the fact it would eventually redeem him of his torment and act. The entire premise based on the fact that ‘suffering is a must’ had got me really gripped. But his belief (whilst in Siberia) of not being able to get away with the murder and confessing to it (unlike Napoleon, and other superlative men) was his ‘mere crime’. But would that mean that he admitted to the fact the he was in the category of ordinary men and not the superior race, the theory he himself had published? If no, then it disappoints me."

"531",530,"H.","I first started this novel during my senior year of high school. I only now, over a decade later, picked it up again and finally finished it. I am glad I waited. Dostoyevsky’s classic novel is worth the more serious treatment of a voluntary read. Dostoyevsky uses a young, naïve protagonist to explore the nature of conscience and morality and take a rusty axe head repeatedly to the skull of the nihilism sweeping Russia at the time.Raskolnikov is an impoverished, depression-prone college dropout living in Petersburg. Crime and Punishment was published in 1866 and takes place contemporaneously. Desperate for money and convinced that some people (including Napoleon and, not surprisingly, himself) are above moral prohibitions on harming others, Raskolnikov decides to kill a miserly pawnbroker. He rationalizes that the benefit to the world from the good the money will allow him to do more than outweighs the harm to the world from the death of the old woman.The bulk of the novel focuses on Raskolnikov’s inner turmoil and tortured emotional journey after the murder. Raskolnikov’s sister, his friend, and the daughter of a man he met by chance see him through his despair. It has to be incredibly difficult to write a novel without action to use as a crutch, but Dostoyevsky does so masterfully. This novel will leave you thinking long after you put it down and has made it on to the short list of novels that I can point to as forming an important part of my personal philosophy (The Orchard Keeper by Cormac McCarthy being another).One word of warning: the English translation produced a readable prose, but Russian naming conventions remain and a single character will be referred to by several different names at different times.My edition was translated by Constance Garnett and includes an introduction by Joseph Frank that discusses Dostoyevsky’s process in writing it and tries to give it a context within the Russia of that time."
"532",531,"Iulia","4.5This book was fascinating. The depth, complexity and variety of characters alongside a nicely done narration make this book exceptional. Actually, the main reason why i decided to write this ""review"" was just to emphasize that Porfiry Petrovich is one of the most interesting, smart and cunning characters that I've ever come across in any book I've read. The conversations between him and Raskolnikov are each a piece of art. However, the last page of this book completely changed everything for me. I was so glad that, finally, a main character has no romantic interest for anyone whatsoever. The whole vibe of the book was changed in just one page out of 500. Putting that aside, this book is phenomenal and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in something smart, beautiful and mindblowing. "

"535",534,"Vickii","Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is a shockingly intimate tale of a murder and a murderer. Raskolnikov is a man seemingly on the brink of madness as he plots and carries out a grisly killing. Although he evades the police, Raskolnikov's dark deed weighs heavily on him. The aftermath of his crime takes the young man on a journey through the range of human emotion and experience. Good and evil, guilt and redemption, agony and joy—this novel is an invitation to explore and question many of the ideas and judgments we take for granted.If you enjoy pondering the grey areas of life and the thorny end of morality, this book covers it extremely well. After reading Tolstoy’s enriching portrayal of St Petersburg in the 19th century, it was engrossing to read about the grittier side of Russian society. "
"536",535,"Dancingdaysareback","(Videoreseña aquí)Todos los veranos me propongo un reto en lo que a lecturas se refiere. Bueno, no todos, puede que este año haya sido el primero, pero ¿qué más da? Por lo general suelo decir lo típico de ""este verano aprovecharé para leer mucho más de lo que he podido leer durante el curso"". Sin embargo, estas vacaciones la cosa cambió. Dado que gran parte de mi tiempo libre iba a pasarlo metida en la biblioteca, estudiando para recuperar las asignaturas que me habían quedado para septiembre, el tema de la lectura estaba un poco más complicado. Lo único que se me ocurrió ante tal panorama fue, no retarme a leer tropecientos mil libros, sino a comenzar Crimen y castigo de Dostoievski y acabarlo antes de la llegada del otoño.La edición con la que yo contaba era del Círculo de Lectores del año de María Castaña, lo que implicaba que las letras eran minúsculas y que el interlineado todavía no había sido descubierto. Lejos de echarme para atrás estos pequeños detalles, me entraron más ganas de leerlo, de demostrarme que podía con un tocho así. Sin embargo (y ahora es cuando me quito el poco mérito que tiene leer al señor Friodor), todo fue coser y cantar, muy en contra de que pensaba en un principio.Si bien la primera parte (hay seis en total) se me hizo algo pesada, fue pasara a la segunda y sentir una urgencia irrefrenable por saber qué pasaba a continuación, por conocer cuál iba a ser el siguiente movimiento de Raskólnikov. Y es que, a pesar de lo minúsculas que podrían ser las letras y de lo extenso del libro, la historia que narra atrapa casi desde el primer hachazo que el protagonista le da a la vieja usurera. Dostoievski traza una senda a través de las distintas fases emocionales y psicológicas que Rodia atraviesa tras llevar a cabo el asesinato, y lo hace de manera magistral, como sólo un genio sabe hacerlo.Crimen y castigo no es un libro en el cual vayamos a encontrarnos con una trama digna de novela negra, desde el principio se sabe quién, cómo y cuándo ha llevado a cabo el asesinato. Lo que Crimen y castigo hace es conducirnos a través de la psicología de un personaje extremadamente misántropo con unos aires de grandeza que ve cómo poco a poco su talento se va consumiendo entre las cuatro paredes de la ruinosa habitación que alquila con el poco dinero que sus madre y hermana pueden mandarle. El castigo al que hace referencia el título no es otro que el castigo que el mismo Raskólnikov se impone de manera inconsciente, la sensación de nerviosismo, de desprecio, de confusión que tiene en todo momento, la necesidad de autoconvencerse de que todo va bien, de que no tiene nada que temer aunque sabe que el más leve indicio puede llevarlo directo al fracaso.Pero no todo queda en el protagonista, en torno a él giran otros personajes de igual complejidad, cada uno con sus propias cargas y pesares: Sonia, Razumijin, Dunia... y Svidigrailov. Éste último aparece casi al final de la novela y desempeña un papel decisivo en ella. Es el antagonista que no llega a ser del todo malvado, hasta sus actos resultan humanos si nos paramos a reflexionar sobre ellos, sobre todo si se tiene en cuenta cuál es su final y lo amargo de éste.La verdad es que me alegro de haberme propuesto leer este libro antes del 21 de septiembre (aunque haya apurado hasta el día antes), porque Crimen y castigo es una obra redonda, se mire por donde se mire."
"537",536,"Annette Young","Like the Colossos of Rhodes, 'Crime and Punishment' is a giant that straddles two shores - the enlightened romanticism of the Napoleonic era, and the terror of Nietzche's Ubermann inherent in the theories of the early twentieth century totalitarian regimes. Both are encapsulated in the central character, Raskolinkov. Deprived by circumstance and deluded by theory, he commits murder. The crime shatters his world view. Raskolnikov is a broken man: broken in spirit, broken in mind, nearly broken in body, and broken away from society. The misery and poverty of mid-century St Petersburg is an appropriate setting for the exploration of, at times, perverse humanity, its propensity for wrong-doing, its weakness and folly, and its dire need for redemption. Hope resides with the minor female characters who, despite their vulnerability and social inferiority, have the strength of character, faith, emotional resilience and moral discernment to rise above their difficulties and bring about a satisfying resolution. Alongside the passionate Dounia, and the long-suffering Sonya, are presented two of the most despicable (and brilliantly created) villains, against whom the reader is able to assess Raskolnikov and his crime. The plot rambles, but is compelling and thought provoking in terms of its psychology, its drama, its humour and its pathos. Most outstanding of all is the compassion which lies at the novel's heart, and it is this quality which makes 'Crime and Punishment' a fulfilling read."

"553",552,"Vani Vani","In Crime and Punishment, Fyodor Dostoyevsky explores the vagaries of a human mind, such as those that can drive a man to unimagined levels of insanity. The story’s protagonist is a young University student called, Raskolnikov who believes that it is for ordinary men to live a life of submission; extraordinary men like him can commit any crime as long as it serves the greater good of the society. His overweening sense of pride is crushed to bits when he falls into an endless cycle of poverty with no one to help but an old friend called Razumihin. He is in this fragile mental state when he decides to murder an old pawnbroker who he compares to a louse and in his mind, he’ll be serving the humanity by eliminating her. It is a coincidence then that he ends up murdering her half-sister, too. Later in the story, even as he tries, he’s not able to square with the ignominy of the brutal crime. He falls sick and is in constant delirium, to the extent of disowning his family and friends. And while he is languishing in guilt and shame, the police investigators begin to suspect him, a few of them even start to follow his movements. In the words of one of the characters: “Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn?....for every man must have somewhere to turn...” In the end, the protagonist has nowhere to turn, not even himself, question is, will he confess his crime? Will he finally find his peace? Crime and Punishment is a wonderful novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Dostoyevsky's novels are considered one of the best in existentialist literature, and I totally agree with that."

"558",557,"Marcos Junior","É Sonha que coloca a pergunta definitiva para Raskolnikov: como viver depois de tamanho crime? Até então o protagonista não tinha se dado conta de que ao comer o crime definitivo, tirar a vida de alguém, a vida moral se tornava impossível. Há um momento que ele critica duramente Svidrigailov por ter escutado uma conversa íntima por trás da parede e este ri: como poderia ter direito de criticar um pecado menor quem tinha cometido o maior de todos? Um desnorteado Raskolnikov parecia não perceber que ao se dar o direito de cometer um único crime tinha aberto sua vida para todos os demônios e que jamais teria paz com suas própria consciência.Lembrei de um ensaio memorável de Chesterton sobre MacBeth. Raskolnikov também se deixara levar pela maior das tentações: se permitir um único ato vil, a remoção de um único obstáculo, e depois seguir sua vida como se nada tivesse acontecido, retomando um caminho de moralidade. Chesterton observava que isso era uma ilusão, que ao abrir o caminho para o mal não havia como mandá-lo de volta como se nada tivesse acontecido, que a tentação de abrir essa porta novamente seria cada vez mais forte.(Alerta Spoiler!)Tanto para Chesterton, como para Dostoievsky, o único caminho para retomar a sanidade depois de um crime capital era o arrependimento cristão. Alguém pode achar que é um arrependido Raskolnikov que se entrega à polícia, mas não é verdade. Ele o faz a contragosto, empurrado por Sonha e Dúnia, e só quer se livrar daquele estado que o está destruindo. Permanece acreditando que a velha usurária era apenas uma pulga que merecia aquele destino. É só no epílogo, em um cena memorável com Sonha, que se permite contemplar a verdade e sente a dor de seu crime. É ali que o arrependimento entra na vida de Raskolnikov e como Dostoievsky narra, nasce um homen novo. Não é imediato, haverá sete anos pela frente para uma reconstrução, mas ele não estará sozinho, terá sempre Sonha a seu lado para manter suas forças."

"563",562,"Fewlas","Come dovuta premessa devo dire che il mio sarà soltanto un personalissimo commento che non ha nessunissima pretesa di essere un’esauriente descrizione di questo libro. Non sarei proprio capace di parlarne “seriamente”. Quindi quello che ho voluto fare è stato buttare giù due righe su quella che è secondo me la genesi di Delitto e castigo.Questa genesi si lega nella mia immaginazione ad una figura mitologica chiamata Urizen, opera del genio di William Blake. Forse è stato proprio il cattolicesimo non religioso di Delitto e castigo a suggerirmi queste profane origini mitologiche. E, insomma, mi sono immaginata il demiurgo Urizen tra le sue reti e i suoi compassi: dapprima col compasso aveva delineato i limiti dell’umano, poi con le reti gli umani li aveva proprio pescati, per non dire intrappolati. Non per cattiveria; essendo lui il demiurgo, il mondo l’ha dovuto creare e agli uomini ha dovuto dare la ragione: in fondo, il suo nome si legge anche come “Your reason”, oltre che essere molto somigliante a horizon: che sia proprio la nostra ragione dunque il nostro limite, il nostro orizzonte? Quando Urizen si immaginò per la prima volta questo suo nome molto probabilmente gli venne in mente come una premonizione un uomo in particolare, di nome Raskolnikov. Infatti, quell’uomo in futuro avrebbe tentato di chinarsi per raggiungere il potere, avrebbe cercato di non immaginarselo proprio quell’orizzonte limitato [,] dalla ragione avrebbe ricavato logiche solo sue, idee così forti da spingere oltre, da divenire ossessioni. A questo punto per Urizen il gioco era fatto. Aveva premonito la vita del figlio, e nel momento stesso in cui la folgorazione gli aveva reso tutto chiaro, invece di iniziare a plasmare qualcosa come la felicità, decise che l’uomo avrebbe avuto bisogno d’altro. Quindi, dopo aver accantonato quella sostanza chiara fatta di beate ignoranze e di troppo lievi e poco consapevoli soddisfazioni, si voltò senza alcun dubbio verso il suo scaffale prediletto, ne trasse un libro che parlava proprio di quell’uomo, e lo gettò giù nel mondo. Trattavasi proprio di Delitto e castigo. Nel momento in cui lo fece non condannò l’uomo a perdere la serenità che doveva essere plasmata al posto del libro. La sua scelta significò la speranza che egli riponeva in una sfida: che qualcuno si sforzasse a superare lui, il suo nome, e perfino se stesso. Leggerlo, quindi, oltre che una preziosa opportunità, è un dovere umano. "
"564",563,"Franky","I’m trying to go back and review some of my favorites from years past. I sort of hate reviewing my favorites because I never feel like I do them any justice. Crime and Punishment is one of those. What I love about Dostoevsky is that he digs into the depths of human nature, mankind’s failings and capabilities of redemption. Like many of his novels, self-examination and personal struggle become a key element in Crime and Punishment. Crime and Punishment examines one man’s decision to murder and his ultimate punishment for it. While on the surface this may seem a simplistic premise, there is much to the protagonist’s struggle. After Raskolnikov kills an old pawnbroker, he is thrust into a world of both psychological and spiritual anguish. Although believing that his deed will benefit humanity, the act actually takes a different course, and becomes a basis for Raskolnikov’s isolation from his family and friends, and his ultimate inner turmoil. The atmosphere of Crime and Punishment is both crime drama and psychological thriller, as part of the story is the main character trying to evade detection from his crime, but there are also deep philosophical lessons about man’s ability to reform after such a heinous, callous act. Raskolnikov’s fall from the depths of society—physically, emotionally, spiritually-- is essentially his punishment.Dostoevsky often paints his characters in a true, and sometimes ugly, light. What gives the book an authentic feel is that this is a fallible, sinful protagonist who has the potential to change. There are also some despicable characters out to test and pull down the protagonist. Sonya, a young girl who is forced to prostitute to support her family, becomes the symbol of purity and a saving grace to Raskolikov. Over all, Crime and Punishment is a deep and complex novel, one that makes you think deeply about the nature of sin and redemption. It is also an exceptional psychological crime novel, superbly written, and well deserving of its classic status. "
"565",564,"Namrirru","Which is my favorite, Crime and Punishment or Adolescent? *deep sigh* I don't know! I love Dostoevsky more than any other Russian writer because his women characters are intelligent and interesting. They have depth that many male novelists can't capture. He's also a master of relationships. There's history you can feel between characters, families and friendships, tensions and hatred long in the making. "
"566",565,"Ingewemme","Just finished my first encounter with Dostojevskij.What an extremely well written and interesting novel! Dostojevskij's incomparable ability to show the interchangeable human mind blew me away already at the first page. His rich descriptions of the filthy and horrific Skt. Petersborg made my nostrils flare with disgust and my brain dissolve in literary bliss. Raskolnikov, a depressed, isolated and poor former student plays with the thoughts of murder and robbery. An elderly pawn shop owner who embodies all the disgusting characteristics of the human race evokes his anger and hunger for fairness in the world. Hence, he plans the perfect murder - both to rid the world of a nuisance, but also to rob her shop and get the financial means to restore a reasonable lifestyle. As the murder is no secret and is implied from the very first page, this crime novel is not about the mystery of revealing the murderer, but a mystery of the nature of crime and murder and the mystery of the human mind and mankinds ability to commit horrible deeds.What keeps the reader ever intrigued and on his toes are the lively and dramatic dialogues, dense descriptions of the question of guilt and sanity and naturally the question: Will he be caught? Dostojevskij does not try to separate good from evil, nor does he try to condemn Raskolnikov's actions. He merely describes the nature of humanity when put to the ultimate test. And he does it so well. Throughout the novel, you can easily feel that Dotojevskij himself has had to explore his own relationship with crime and its effects on man. As a young man he was due to illegal political ideas sentenced to death. Only in the very last moment, when some of his friends already had the noose around their necks, they were pardoned and sent to Siberia for years. In his work you detect comments on the inhumane toying with others' lives that in some instances caused insanity for members of his group. In Siberia, Dostojevskij befriended criminals of all sorts and his great insight in their minds and reasoning, enriches his take on Raskolnikov's inner battle.Crime and Punishment has been a great introduction to Dostojevskij's work and will not be the only of his novels that I will enjoy hours reading. Get reading!"

"568",567,"Jose","This is the story of a crime, but rather than to investigate who did it, the big question is why? In looking for Raskolnikov's motivation, Dostoyevsky exposes the psychology of the unconscious long before Freud. Reading this was a torture I couldn't get away from. Woke up this morning at 4:30 just to finish reading it. Great expose of the human nature. Who is not a criminal in this novel? Every character is nuanced with both good and evil sides.

"570",569,"Jerome Kuseh","One of the best novels I have ever read. Dostoyevsky takes you into the mind of a young man who murders two women and is not sure why. Was it because he needed the money one of the women - a loan shark - kept? Was it because he felt that he was of the class of men who had the right to kill for the good of humanity? Or did he just do it for kicks? I found a lot of similarities between Raskolnikoff and Levin (from Tolstoy's Anna Karenina) in terms of their journey from secularism to religion. This is no doubt reflective of the journey of Dostoyevsky himself.This enthralling journey through the mind of an anti-social criminal is worth every ounce of praise that has been heaped on it's already weighty legacy."
"571",570,"Eadie","This is a must read classic. It explores the mind of the kind-hearted Raskolnikov and his psychological journey to hell amidst poverty and corruption. I found this book riveting and difficult to put down. Dostoevsky describes the emotions of his characters in such way, it makes the reader actually feel what the characters are going through. This is Dostoevsky's greatest masterpiece and definitely a book everyone should read. "
"572",571,"Josh","What an engaging, powerful, and intellectually gripping tale of a man who is willing to experiment an idea on the human race. Yet, what follows this act of malice is not a search for empirical evidence, but rather, a rudimentary probing of the human conscience. Doestovsky does literature and his readers a great service with Crime and Punishment! Read and be amazed! "
"573",572,"Cent","“The real culprit is a theorist, a bookworm, who, in a tentative kind of way, has done a more than bold thing ...The man in question has forgotten to cut off evidence, and in order to work out a theory, has killed two persons. He has committed a murder, and yet he has not known how to take possession of the pelf...he has committed a murder and yet continues to look upon himself as a righteous man!” -Porphyrius PetrovichThe Crime and Punishment revolves around the character of Rodion Raskolnikov, an ex-student who murdered an old money lender, Alena, and her younger sister-servant, Elizabeth. It is a crime story, but what Dostoevsky discloses in every chapter are not evidences and clues that lead the investigator to trace the criminal. What he explores is something within us, the individual and the depth of the human nature and soul, its rationalities and irrationalities, its sanities and insanities. The crime could simply refer to the “murder,” and the apparent punishment could be Rodion’s incarceration and his labour to Siberia. But the novel also suggests that the main crime is not the ""act itself"" but the theory that rationalizes the act. Rodion believed he was making a rational act, despite his main motive was vague. He was doing a great service to humanity by killing a despicable money-lender. He was trudging the path to greatness by having the courage to transgress the norms, in similar fashion how Napoleon and other great people had violated what commonly called as normal. Rodion was making an experiment of his theory and of himself.With this, Dostoevsky dramatically poses the question about the relation between morality and rationality. Socrates/Plato has framed that what is rational is moral, that “ignorance is the root and stem of all evil.” Yet the novel suggests otherwise. It shows that what is “rational” could not necessarily mean “moral,” what is rational could not mean human. What is rational could be a mere pretension of knowing the answer. The novel evokes that theoretical explanations may sound plausible but it could not grasp everything, it could have left behind something, which perhaps the most essential. Dostoevsky shows that theoretical explanations have inadequately grasped the whole of Rodion’s experience, his real punishment. The theories merely explained that the murder was committed out of his poverty or of his psychological condition. They could not take into account the gravity of Rodion’s suffering condition. They could not conceptualize how he was aware of his madness. His arbitrary movements, cunning decisions, convulsions, nervousness, anxieties, these conditions spoke on their own, as Rodion’s body could not lie. Yet, the theories did not speak about them, it did not articulate how he felt severed from the whole mankind. The theories were silent about his guilt.The theories could not redeem Rodion. What saved him was not his reason, for the reason’s end point for all we know is nihilistic. In its search for foundation it realizes that it is grounded in nothing. Its end point is undergroundman's self destruction, or Karamasov’s “everything is permitted,” or Svidrigailoff’s heroic acceptance of fate on his suicide. Who saved him was Sophia Semenovna who provided Rodion new life, alluding to how Christ resurrected Lazarus. She's like the Karamasov’s Alyosha. Her character emanates naive, pure, and unconditional love. She is the antithesis of reason, as unlike Rodion she is not an intellectual. She meagerly learned how tho read, and yet her acts provided what Rodion's reason could not provide. Her love accepted what is rationally condemnable. Her love spoke of the beauty of life as it grew not from affluence but from lack, not from joy but from pain, a love that sprang from a point when it was unreasonable to love. What saved Rodion was not love of Sophia but Sophia’s love.Her love brings us hope, a way, perhaps an antidote against the nihilism of reason. Sophia have shown that when the time the “love of wisdom” could no longer speak, it is the “wisdom of love” that must act in silence. "

This is not one of those books which provide answers for the questions thrown at you, but instigates questions in yourself and let you run looking for answers. Few which are still in my head, are as follows:Will it make a difference if the bloodshed is for greater good or higher purposes?Will we still admit our crime out of heartfelt repentance or at least feel guilty, when there is no evidence to prove us as guilty and when the most ignoble criminals and rascals are walking this earth without any remorse?Will the belief protect and absolve us?Will love bring the deliverance?Damn... Too many questions already. May you and I find answers in our ways!"
"575",574,"Melissa","This book is one of the most emotionally stirring books I have ever read. I loved it and will read it over every few years. It is definitely one that I could get more out of at each reading."
"576",575,"Francisco","Una novela psicológica como las que me gustan, reconozco que puede parecer lenta pero cada personaje y parte de la historia tiene mucho sentido aunque no lo parezca. En mi opinión la mitad de la obra transcurre en San Petersburgo y la otra mitad en la cabeza de Raskolnikof. En ese sentido no es una novela muy policial.Independiente de la tesis de Raskolnikof, lo que ejemplifica Dostoievski es la acción de la culpa y el remordimiento. Yo cometo un crímen, sé que esta acción tiene una consecuencia o varias consecuencias y estas consecuencias de alguna u otra forma se desencadenan. También es una buena lectura históricamente hablando porque es la Rusia de mediados del siglo XIX, hay varios detalles en el relato que nos dan luces de cómo vivían y cómo pensaban. "
"577",576,"Mike Frost","One of the books that I felt I had to read after the paucity of literature that I could consume in graduate school, it took me a while to get into Dostoevsky's tale of the decisions that can push someone to step outside the accepted boundaries of society. It really wasn't until I reached the inspector's monologue at the police station that I could full see Dostoevsky's genius. I wonder what this would be like in the Russian."
"578",577,"Andrew Cao","There was a time when I would have shoved this book aside after reading the first few pages because it is not as action packed like some fantasy stories. This book, however, provides deep insight to the conflict ongoing within Raskolnikov's mind. His mind is split between doing the right thing for himself or doing the right doing for the everyone else. Being an intelligent man, this story does not use cliché thoughts or feelings for Raskolnikov at times that they wee expected to used, and the unpredictability in his mind gives a good twist on the story."
"579",578,"Alaa","The very first classic I LOVE!You gotta read it! It mightn't be that attractive at first but it's amazing (I promise). You'll find yourself crying and smiling. And guess what, it has a happy ending! "
"580",579,"Andrew","I am finally finished with my summer of Russian literature reading list...in winter...a year and half later. I thought this to be very Russian and appropriate. This was by far the best of the ""Big 4."" Great, active voice translation."
"581",580,"Blaise","Crime and Punishment is one of the best books I've ever read. It's one of those rare books that I will probably carry around with me for the rest of my life because it changed the way I look at some aspects of life. The harrowing account of crime and guilt that encompasses most of the narrative is unforgettable. Dostoevsky shows an incredible understanding of human psychology, particularly as it relates to sin and guilt. I found myself relating to feelings I go through when I make mistakes in life, albeit to a much lesser degree. Some critics have argued that no literary work makes a stronger case for the existence of Deity, and I agree that Dostoevsky makes an extremely compelling case here. The dialogue between Raskolnikov and several other notable characters (particularly the detective chasing him) is a real strength in the novel. It's one of those books that's just compulsively readable, where I just couldn't wait to see how it would end."

"584",583,"Nargus","It started out as an e-book on the relatively small screen of my phone ... then a print book, then my train book, my bus book, my oh-no-spilt-coffee-on-it book (cringe, from a Starbucks coffee cup I thought no longer had coffee in it and had stuffed into my bag), my bus-stop book, my break book, my hospital book*, my home book, my procrastination book, my so-distracting-me-from-everything-else book, my got-to-finish-now book ... my WOW book. Well, it was more than just a physical journey with this book, it was enlightening in many ways.Crime and Punishment proved to be a superb read, and more. Instantly, I was struck by the thoughts and eccentricities of the central character, Raskolnikov. I found myself falling asleep ... with the character as he slept (during a very early morning train ride I had), pondering while he pondered, questioning while he questioned, and even experiencing the agony of a nightmare that led me to sob. As the consequences of what Raskolnikov does unfolds in the book, so too do we discover the many layers and meanings to him and his actions.Dostoyevsky skilfully divulges the thoughts and beliefs, conscious and subconscious, of his characters in such a way that we are moved by them ... moved to reflect, moved to consider, moved to be repelled, moved to sympathise, moved to empathise. It's so human, real and raw - the thoughts and the characters, but there's much edible food for thought. Not only are we privy to the thoughts of the central character, Raskolnikov, but also the people who he meets, who are with him and who are not with him. Through these vantage points, we gain new and different insights, about Raskolnikov, and the characters themselves - interesting and complex in their own right. The subject matter seems, at face value, not a strikingly original concept: a man commits a crime (I could easily say what...but you know what, why should I spoil anything). But Dostoyevsky manages to create a strikingly original novel. It even sounds heinous, the subject matter, but it's a novel that never condones, but proves to be deep, very deep. It's an exploration of why he did what he did, and it's repercussions, for himself and those around him. It's an exploration of individuality and conflict within the individual. It's an exploration of suffering. Even amongst the characters, interesting ideas are discussed and challenged. The book reeks of intelligent and thought-provoking insights ... it reeks! (here I'm using the word in the most positive sense, if that's allowable).I found the novel to be a compelling read from beginning to end. It made such an impression on me (I was underlining, and writing notes along its margins incessantly). It's incredible that Dostoyevsky manages to convey such depth and intrigue when nothing much is happening but a man is wandering the streets or is cramped in an unpleasant closet-like room, for example (in fact, it would be interesting to find out how much of the book takes place in this setting - 50%?). Not to say that nothing happens in the novel. Not at all. There is a crime committed, that shakes one, and involves others. There are consequences, complications, and agendas. There are sub-plots, which rather than distracting us from the central plot, build on it. Such engaging human interactions that seem so real. It's about one character, but it's also about many others. Because of the novel's multi-dimensional and humanistic portrayal of characters and events, I felt I could relate and became attached in some way or another. Crime and Punishment is a book that is certainly a worthy read. I really liked it. Note: I read the Vintage Classics edition of this novel, which is touted to be the best translation available in English, and I found it very good, so I recommend this version (which also comes with helpful annotations). But I don't recommend reading the little blurb at the back of the book - be warned, it spoils it for you, and after finishing the novel, is much too simplistic and basically misses the point.(*not as a patient, but as a medical student)"

To me it was about the Gospels laid out in the excruciating pain of real life. I'm now reading The Idiot and trying hard not to compare the two books."

"588",587,"s.penkevich","‘To go wrong in one's own way is better then to go right in someone else's.’I have been giving a lot of thought to this novel lately. Despite the three years that have gone by since reading Crime and Punishment—three years in which I’ve read some outstanding literature, joined Goodreads and written just over 100 reviews of the books I’ve journeyed through—Dostoevsky’s novel still resides on it’s throne as my personal favorite novel. No other web of words, brushstrokes or music melody has ever struck me so deeply and consumed me so completely as this book did. The author’s collection of works as a whole has left such a mark on my soul that I felt it necessary to permanently affix his likeness on my arm. Over a century has passed since its initial publication, yet Dostoevsky’s message is still as poignant today as it was when it was first inked onto paper. Crime and Punishment features an immensely engaging blend of intrigue; philosophy; political, social, moral and religious commentary, that all thread together to create a masterpiece of literature that captures the deep, raw core of the human condition when it is at it’s most gruesome and vulnerable. The exquisite literary genius of the novel evoked a strong emotional resonance in me and the timing of my reading was just right to forever wed me to my love of books.Initially envisioned as two separate novels, one following the inner turmoil of a murderer and the other chronicling the melancholic destruction of a family due to a flighty, alcoholic patriarch, Dostoevsky deftly weaves together a multitude of unforgettable characters as they interplay through their tangle of plotlines. There are some incredible scenes that will forever haunt and delight me in my memory, such as the narrow escape from the scene of the crime which had me holding my breath in anxious anticipation, the darkly comical disaster of the funeral feast, or the emotionally charged and grim meeting between Dunya and the vile Svidrigaïlov. Each character is carefully balanced with their foil, each character is written with their own unique style of speech and language, and the novel seems to tie every thread together with such perfection and care as it churns forward, raining destruction on the lives of it’s characters to bring them toward their own personal redemption or demise. This was a book that I was unable to put down as the words flowed from their pages to deep within my heart. Dostoevsky brilliantly straps the reader to the emotional states of his characters and is able to create seamless transitions between scenes or from the minds of one character to the next by riding the wings of an emotion. Most often this emotion is guilt, and the murder scene and it’s feverish follow-up is so expertly crafted that the reader feels they must share in Raskolnikov’s guilty burden. During the course of reading this book, I was overwhelmed by a crushing sense of guilt that was disconnected to any of my own actions. Yet, had police officers confronted me at any given moment, I would have held out my hands in surrender since I was so burdened by the guilty residue of the novel. What further linked me to the book was Raskolnikov’s illness following his crime. Maybe it wasn’t the novel taking root in my soul, perhaps it was due to the cold fall weather that was creeping in at the time, or perhaps it was due to my lack of sleep and early rising to embark on 10-12hr shifts in an unheated factory where I would work away amidst a cloud of aluminum dust, but I felt feverish and ill alongside Raskolnikov and his fever dreams. I don’t think I felt well again until after finishing the book.I believe I read Crime and Punishment at the ideal moment in my life. I had spent the summer going through several of Dostoevsky’s other novels and falling madly in love with his writing. Then my whole life was uprooted. At the time I began C&P, I had moved across the state away from all my friends, family, and everything I knew and recognized, to live in Holland with my brand new baby daughter and work in a factory that could easily serve for a modern day sequel to Sinclair’s The Jungle. Looking back, I think I can see why I so easily soaked up Raskolnikov’s feelings. Dostoevsky shows how we are a product of our choices, and it is how we deal with our consequences that makes us who we are. I was placed in the new situation because of choices I had made, like choosing to skip class to smoke and read by the river, and Raskolnikov was faced with the guilt of his own actions. It was the most dramatic shift in my life and I am not a person who enjoys change, yet here I was without a familiar face and nobody to talk to. Crime and Punishment was there in my hand every morning and night as I walked between my home and car, like a friend holding my hand to comfort and encourage me in my exhaustion. It rode shotgun on my hour commutes like a faithful companion, and was the friendly face in which I could take refuge in on my breaks. When stripped of all I knew, there was literature to keep me sane and give me something to hold on to as my world spiraled out of control around me (my daughter was also a tether of sanity for me, but fatherhood was still new and intimidating at the time). Dostoevsky and his beautiful words became my friend and my passion, and in my solitude (because, let’s face it, I was very much an oddball in that factory and it took awhile to find my place there) I plunged myself deep into books, something I am very thankful for and feel that all the strangeness and loneliness of the existence is washed away by the glow I feel from grappling with my favorite authors. Then I discovered Goodreads and you all became incredibly dear to me. I don’t think I would have survived my time in that dark pit without you all, so, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.I apologize that this isn’t really much of a review, I’m very excited for  this review, as it was seeing this GR friend—one of which I hold in the highest regard and am always incredibly impressed by—reading Crime and Punishment that brought back a flood of memories of my times with the book as if I were Proust with his madeleines. I highly recommend this novel, and firmly stand by my choice of it as my favorite. Recently, I had to make a list for work of my top 5 favorite books, which was difficult to do, damn near impossible, but I realized how simple it was to put a book down in the #1 slot. I have read some incredible books since, Hunger (my love of which stems from the similarities to Dostoevsky I noticed in the book), Gravity’s Rainbow, or To the Lighthouse to name a few, yet nothing has ever left as deep of an impact on me as a reader and as a human being as this book. This is a fantastic book about the human spirit, about our deepest, darkest impulses, and shows that our own inner consciousness can dish out a far greater punishment than any legal system can. Now I need to sleep and sober up.5/5‘ I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity.’"
"589",588,"Shuprova","It's almost impossible to write a review of this book that is worthy of it. I feel like I've come across quite a few writers who understand human nature well and write really believable characters by just getting into their heads - but no one quite does it like Dostoevsky, to the extent that I would read before bed and dream about Rodya, and wake up almost sure that I had killed a person, and I would be torn between being horrified and loathing myself, and thinking I did right. Only there were also about a hundred different emotions he experienced between the two black and white ones I mentioned. Dostoevsky's psychological insight into the protagonist is unbelievable. I was going to write that you can't help but feel pity for Rodya while also hating him, but the truth is you don't get a choice, because after a while you are Rodya, and that's the best way I can describe this book. Also, his exchanges with the investigator Porfiry were some of the best parts of the book, and always had me on the edge of my seat (or reading chair, to be precise). "

Si te consigue atrapar la historia principal, será un placer ver el universo que rodea al protagonista. Es un estudio psicológico de un crimen. Raskolnikov decide matar a una vieja prestamista, avara y malvada, según su opinión, es un piojo para la sociedad. Es un crimen meditado (esta “ética lógica y razonada” recuerda a Nietzsche), que el protagonista intenta justificar moralmente. Este es el tema central, pero a raíz de aquí surgen varios argumentos, personajes y situaciones enriquecedoras. Para mí tiene gran importancia los personajes femeninos de su hermana, y su amiga prostituta, su papel es fundamental en Raskolnikov. Toda la novela es una lucha de ideales y sentimientos analizados psicológicamente, sin olvidar la crítica social de su tiempo. Hay grandes descripciones, y excelentes diálogos, de diferentes temáticas: filosófica, religiosa, moral, social, o de los más nobles sentimientos. Es una novela imprescindible, y totalmente recomendable."

"595",594,"Elizabeth (Alaska)","I read the edition included here: Works of Fyodor Dostoevsky: Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, The Brothers Karamazov, The Gambler, The Devils, The Adolescent & more, translated by Constance Garnett. My understanding is that there may be better translations, but one could hardly argue with this one. I didn't read it in Russian and I'll still rave about the prose - three instances in particular. First, there was a scene where Raskolnikov steps into a tavern and a fellow starts talking to him. One sentence and I knew the fellow was very drunk, though not a slurred word on the page. It was at least a paragraph before Dostoevsky mentions it. Ok, so perhaps I should have led a more sheltered life, but how can a single sentence of dialogue convey a man's state of mind so clearly that I got it immediately! Brilliant!Second, a few chapters later Raskolnikov left his dwelling voicing internally complete and utter indignation about the contents of a letter. Sometimes the voicing was not so internal, so that passersby turned to look at him. The pace of the next few paragraphs was perfect! Doestoevsky only wrote what Raskolnikov was thinking, yet we get the the quick steps, the hand gesture, the mumbling. The reader might not have had the same indignant reaction to the letter, but there could be no mistaking Raskolnikov!Third, there was a conversation between Raskolnikov and a young woman (I don't want to write any spoilers), where the silence of the gaps in conversation was palpable, and I felt myself straining to hear when they whispered. It was almost as if you could hear the characters breathing, though Dostoevsky never alluded to it. Raskolnikov paced the floor and I swear I could hear the floor boards creak, - again not a mention from Dostoevsky. How was he able to convey this mood just with words - and those words not directly convey the mood expressed?Others will write of the story itself. I couldn't turn the pages quickly enough because I needed to know what happened next. I didn't want it to end. "
"596",595,"Charley","At first I wasn't sure whether this novel would be for me, it starts rather slowly. But by the time I had read the first hundred pages or so I had become really invested in it.An enquiry into the nature of 'crime', and what falls under this banner, as well as a demonstration of how the human spirit deals with guilt,  Crime and Punishment  is definitely now one of my favourite classics. "
"597",596,"Mary Jen","One of the books that changed my life. A lot of exposition, but the characters felt so real that I was emotionally distraught for days after I finished the book. Something about Dostoyevsky's novels makes me want to discover St. Petersburg, where most of his novels are set."
"598",597,"Jesi","For those of you who might be afraid of Russian literature because of the long, hard to pronounce names, this is a great novel for you. I’ve read a few things from Dostoevsky and he is clear and understandable. Written in 1917, Crime and Punishment follows impoverished university drop-out, Raskolnikov, as he murders and robs a pawnbroker and her sister, then has to suffer under the consequences of his actions. Raskolnikov is quite possibly the world’s worst criminal and that is kind of Dostoevsky’s point. The crime occurs in the beginning of the story and we watch the character unravel under the guilt of it all. There was no physical evidence tying him to the crime. He could have gotten away with it if he had kept his cool, but instead, Raskolnikov seemed to sabotage himself over and over—behaving nervous and guilty, getting defensive, failing to come forward to the police right away with his involvement with the pawnbroker, raving about the crime while suffering from fever. But Raskolnikov’s actions support Dostoevsky’s belief that people who are basically good will suffer more from their conscience than the actual punishment itself. Is Raskolnikov a good person? He killed two women with an ax and stole from them. On the other hand, when his scoundrel of a drinking buddy dies, leaving a sick wife and several children behind, he gives the widow most of his cash. He also seems to have genuine affection for his sister and saves her from making a mistake of a marriage for the sake of security. He even falls in love with a kind-hearted prostitute, someone whom many men would not consider worthy of love. Overall, I give Crime and Punishment…Plot – 3 ½ bookmarksCharacter Development – 4 bookmarksPsychology – 5 bookmarksLiterary Merit – 4 bookmarksDream Cast (otherwise known as who I pictured while reading) – Robert Pattinson (Raskolnikov), Emily Blunt (Sonia), Michael Sheen (Detective Petrovich), Tom Hardy (Razumihin)"

"601",600,"Jess","I didn't like the story as much as I liked The Brothers Karamazov, but the level of psychological insight in this book is incredible. I love to encounter characters that are supposed to be villians that I can identify with (I think the first time this happened to me consciously was in A Clockwork Orange, but that didn't happen with this book. I didn't identify with Raskolnikov, despite the high level of access to his psychological workings. But I've been learning lately that sometimes more interesting than an instant connection of identification is the process of beating your head against someone that you want to understand, but simply never can."

"607",606,"Gabriela Solis","Sería ocioso añadir algo acerca la maestría narrativa del gigante ruso: su mirada fina para desentrañar las razones y exigencias del alma, su capacidad de construir atmósferas y estados de ánimo, la paciencia para hacernos conocer el tormento de un hombre hasta volvernos partícipe de él, etc.Lo esencial de Crimen y castigo es la angustia de un hombre que quiere saberse extraordinario; su necesidad de someter al espíritu a fuerzas que lo sobrepasan porque la necesidad pesa más que la razón. Durante 700 maravillosas páginas seguimos las cavilaciones de Raskolnikov, la sensación que tiene de estar trágicamente destinado al asesinato de una vieja usurera, la culpa que sobreviene y el terror de no saber qué hacer con esa carga. El protagonista es un personaje interesante porque sus razonamientos están fuera de la ética. No le importa si matar es bueno o malo, sino lo que le probará: si puede hacerlo y vivir con ello, significará que es un hombre destinado a la grandeza. Dice:El hombre extraordinario tiene derecho, no oficialmente, sino por sí mismo, a autorizar su conciencia a franquear ciertos obstáculos, en el caso de exigirlo así la realidad de su idea.Sin embargo, de lo que me interesa hablar aquí no es del desarrollo de la novela, sino del final. Narrado vertiginosamente en algo como 30 o 40 páginas, resulta que Raskolnikov decide confesar y entregarse a la policía. Así lo hace y lo sentencian a 7 años en Siberia, donde se da cuenta de que ama a Sonia y ese amor será su salvación. La decepción fue mi primera respuesta a la conclusión que nuestro camarada ruso decidió para Crimen y castigo. Sin embargo, un par de días después de terminar el libro las ideas se asentaron un poco y hoy me parece que ese es un final tremendo; veladamente terrible.Sí, Raskolnikov confiesa, pero no está arrepentido y lo lamenta. Sabe que arrepentirse sería glorioso: así sentiría que merece el castigo de estar en prisión y confiaría en que ese aislamiento y el someterse a duras tareas físicas son castigos que limpian poco a poco su culpa. Pero no es el caso: el castigo no le traerá calma sino desasosiego.¡Si todavía el destino le hubiera proporcionado el arrepentimiento torturador que destroza el corazón, el arrepentimiento cuyos tormentos son de tal naturaleza que hacen que un hombre se ahorque o se arroje al agua para librarse de él! ¡Oh, entonces lo habría acogido con alegría! Sufrir y llorar es vivir aún. Pero él no se arrepentía de su crimen.Si está en la cárcel es sólo porque la sociedad y sus convenciones lo aplastaron. El titubeo es la falla de carácter de Raskolnikov. Hacia el final de la novela, éste tiene perfectamente claro que él no es un hombre extraordinario porque duda. Dudó de si le correspondían esos tamaños, de si debía o no asesinar a la anciana, de si entregarse o no. Los dioses le extirpan la duda a aquellos que han elegido para la grandeza. Sus espíritus pueden turbarse o no con sus propios actos, esos hombres pueden –y Raskolnikov está convencido de que así es– experimentar sufrimiento por lo que el Destino los ha llamado a hacer: nada de eso importa. Cuando tengan que ejecutar el asesinato, el bombardeo, la toma de un imperio, no dudarán un segundo en hacerlo. Eso es el tormento fundamental de Raskolnikov: saberse ordinario. Peor aún: confirmarse ordinario. Él sospecha que no está destinado a grandes cosas, pero esto le provoca una ansiedad insoportable: a tal grado que echa mano de razonamientos cuidadosamente elucubrados para convencerse de lo contrario. Pero la verdad no puede ser engañada por la inteligencia. Por esto es que resultan tan obscuras un par de reflexiones hacia el final de la novela:Otro pensamiento lo torturaba también: ¿Por qué no se había suicidado? ¿Era tan difícil vencer el sentimiento de amor por la vida?Más titubeo, más duda. En varias ocasiones Raskolnikov juega con la idea del suicido, pero todas las veces termina descartándola con un pretexto distinto: dignidad, honor, responsabilidad. Lo que intenta evadir es la confrontación con su propia mortalidad. Es decir, los hombres extraordinarios trascenderán por sus hazañas, por ser instrumentos de lo divino para manifestarse: poco importa que su cuerpo físico muera porque su espíritu permanecerá por el resto del tiempo. A Raskolnikov le palpita la certeza de que éste no será su caso: otra vez el presentimiento de que él está en la categoría de los hombres comunes, de los que tienen que buscar la felicidad en el matrimonio, en la paternidad, en las nimiedades cotidianas. Se sabe dentro de los que tienen que (intentar) ser felices en esta vida porque una vez muertos nadie los recordará.Esto se encadena con otra declaración que en principio parece un triunfo pero en realidad es la derrota definitiva. En las últimas tres páginas de la novela, Raskolnikov es iluminado por una revelación que, por rápida y repentina, se siente forzada. Sonia lo visita y al tomar sus manos y mirar sus ojos se siente de pronto enamorado y encuentra en ese amor su redención. Piensa en lo afortunado que es y en lo cortos que se harán los días en la cárcel ahora que ama.En aquella primera alegría del retorno a la vida, todo, incluso su crimen, hasta su condena y su deportación a Siberia se le aparecía como un hecho exterior, extraño; parecía casi dudar de que aquello hubiera ocurrido. La vida había sustituido al razonamiento.E inmediatamente después toma los Evangelios que Sonia le dejó y que no había tocado hasta ese momento. Él, el hombre que antes había sentenciado con firmeza:Hay que razonar seriamente y ver las cosas en su verdadero aspecto, en lugar de llorar como un niño y ponerlo todo en manos de Dios.Es el fracaso del hombre que se sabe menor, prescindible, ordinario. Por primera vez, Raskolnikov se niega a razonar porque intuye que la conclusión será insoportable. Y entonces cede, se somete: pondera la vida sobre la grandeza y se dispone a confiar en que otro, Dios, se encargará de la trascendencia de su alma. Raskolnikov está derrotado, el mundo no comprenderá nunca la prueba a la que quiso someter su espíritu y él es demasiado cobarde para enfrentar el resultado fallido de esa prueba y su consecuencia lógica. Así que decide forzar a su espíritu a creer en Dios: la muleta de los enanos que no están llamados a la grandeza pues sólo lo divino puede negar a lo divino.http://placeresdeshonestos.wordpress...."
"608",607,"Nadia","definitely one of my favourite books! "
"609",608,"Sherry","I think this was the first book I read that I really became a part of. The book is so well written that I honestly felt like it was my thoughts and my actions. It is extremely powerful and incredibly dynamic. "
"610",609,"Dale Bazan","A six star book. Great, capital G. Why the heck is there an audiobook? This one's one of those books you go back and read a sentence or a paragraph 5 times over and smile and the structure. Deep, yet pulls you long and leaves you ""saturated."" Classic in every sense of the word, probably my favorite ""classic"" to date. "
"611",610,"Jillx27","Dostoyevsky can do no wrong in my opinion. Another dark and sad Russian tale. Life was tough but there was always the damp, dark flat to go back to with the samovar - time for tea and reflection. Murder is committed fairly early on and Raskolnikov then ties himself in knots trying to justify the act. "
"612",611,"Andrew Calderon","This book in transporting and, if read carefully, can expose our own pessimism about humanity. Dostoevsky manages to construct a world where mercy is demonstrated through punishment, and no crime transpires with impunity, since the conscience is an indefatigable judge, presiding over each character's thoughts and actions. "
"613",612,"Trent Brooks","This is my favorite book of all time. Rodion Ramonovitch Raskalnikov is a great character, whether, in your eyes, he is good or he is bad. I, personally, loved him and sympathized with him throughout the story. I hated people he hated, like Luzhin and the pawnbroker, and I loved people he loved, like Dunya and Sonya. Dostoevsky was marvelous with this work. Now on to The Brothers Karamazov."
"614",613,"Dan","This is considered a timeless classic for good reason. It brilliantly blends ""big"" themes of crime, guilt, redemption and suffering with a brisk story of suspense and intrigue. It was published in 1866 but feels more relevant today than many works of contemporary fiction. The Pevear translation makes it a relatively easy read. "
"615",614,"Victoria Bartlett","It took me about a month to read which slowed down my goals for the year. However it made me realize that I had skipped over really great novels and I will now pursue the classics and longer novels instead of quick reads. This book is amazing, beautiful, it makes you think about the nature of men and why things happen why they do. IT is also a great study of the culture of Russia during the 19th century. "
"616",615,"Mark Valentine","With this book, I had a conversion experience, an epiphany. I first read it in high school on my own, outside of any class assignment or coursework. I remember thinking that that this was it, life and literature like what is found within the covers of this book are worth devoting my life to and I am proud to say that I have a career that keeps me involved with literature still. (I teach.) From Raskolnikov I learned that one can actually play Dodge Ball with the Cosmos. "
"617",616,"Sonee","As Bulgakov puts it in the book ""Master and the Margharita"" - One has to read only a few pages of Dostoyevsky's book to know its been written by a craftsman. Dostoyevsky has painted a landscape depicting the romantic miserableness of a struggling youth and garnished it with self-abandon. He shows Petersburg in all its wretchedness, in it's decrepit imagery of everyday plebeians and its gnawing intellectual movement in the times of drudgery. The protagonist's fleeting sanity can be seen in his hazy thoughts as he wonders and tries to confront the vanishing awareness of his life. And no! it has nothing to do with the crime that he committed that took it away. The whole novel is built around the the real object of the crime and it's beauty comes from what was left unsaid.Rodya was a extraordinarily intelligent and burnt person - singed everywhere one could think of - till it shackled him so much, so immaculately and so pinchingly that he thought of nothing else but breaking through the numbness that was induced by his suffocating surrounding that tried to strap his intellect from truly finding itself. The youthful awareness of ""nothing"" takes on a character in this novel. (view spoiler)[Rodya recollected every ounce of his education, his infirmity,his intelligence and his handsomeness and decided to break into something and commit a crime because - it can perhaps extricate him and the society from something appalling. But, by the time he tried to commit the crime, his awareness had ceased to exist - he was in a delirium which became permanent . He was in that high state that makes us see all things allegorical and ideal and but essentially nothing. He relapsed into sanity at very remote moments when he peeked into the silent certainty of disdain and blind misunderstanding of the society and when he searched for the ""meaning of his crime"".Solitude ceased to exist for him. He couldn't find it in any company - not even Sonya's - someone who was ostracized by the society in a different but intrinsically compatible manner. He saw the vain veils that everyone has put on to religionlize or give some name to the suffering - he had nothing at all to seek his solace in. The universe was a constant nauseating happening.Can anyone write in such plain words and brand the revolting youth and the numbness and nothingness into as a being. Dostoyevsky has done exactly that. As the book progresses, we see Ryoda display an ideology with a strange understanding of the milieu. This book is a moving and poignant painting nothingness and of a youth and who broke a code of the society yet remained so definitely above reproach. (hide spoiler)]"

"619",618,"André José","Este foi um dos melhores livros que li... pecou apenas pelo excesso de discrição em algumas partes que não o exigiam. Em certos capítulos não se retira muito partido para a história sendo simplesmente um pouco de ""adereço"" ao livro. O conteúdo do livro é porém excelente, com uma beleza estilistica entusiasmante e viciante. A grande vontade do leitor para saber o fim vai sendo cada vez maior, sendo que passando as 250 páginas o ritmo da leitura começa a ser cada vez mais rápido. Li o livro em 3 semanas e creio que todos o devem ler. Cheio de mistério, de perturbação que nos atinge a nós mesmos, cheio de questões ao nível da filosofia e cheio de cultura no que compete ao século XIX. Simplesmente fantástico! 5 estrelas!"

And I appreciate that; it's rare that classics are actually page-turners that are a joy to read. "
"621",620,"عبَّاد ديرانية","كانت هذه الرواية هي أولى قراءة لي في الأدب الروسي على الإطلاق، وأيضاً إحدى قراءاتي الأولى في الأدب الكلاسيكي الأوروبي. لم أكد ألمحها أثناء تجولي في معرض الكتاب بعمّان قبل أسبوعين حتى هرعتُ لشرائها على الفور، لكنَّ تسرعي آتى نتائجه سريعاً: فقد ابتعتُ ترجمةً من دار كويتية لمترجم لبناني الجنسية يدعى شوقي حداد، وكانت للأسف موغلةً بالرداءة محفوفةً بالأخطاء المطبعية والإملائية والنحوية، ومملوءةً بالصياغات اللغوية الركيكة غير المفهومة. وفيما بعد، اكتشفت وجود ترجمةٍ أخرى لسامي البارودي على مسافة أرففٍ قليلة منها! لكن حصل ما حصل، وها أنا قد أنهيت الرواية.الحقيقة أنَّ هذه الرواية غريبة قليلاً في طبيعتها، بل وهي غير مألوفةٍ قليلاً في أسلوب سردها ووصفها لحداث، فافترضت بطبيعة الحال أنَّ هذه كانت ملامح الأدب الروسي في عصر دوستوفسكي. أعتقد أنَّ قليلين من القراء اليوم سيستمتعون بها. شخصياً... كانت قرائتها تجربةً جميلة جداً بالنسبة لي، من ناحية أولى لأنني كنت حقيقة مهتماً اهتماماً شديداً بالاطلاع على عيّنة من أدب الكتاب الروس الذي لا أملك فكرة عنه (وخصوصاً دوستوفسكي، الذي قد يكون أشهر كاتبٍ روسي في التاريخ كله)، ومن ناحية ثانيةٍ لأني أحبُّ فعلاً الموضوع الذي تدور حوله هذه الرواية، بل هو - على غرابته - واحدٌ من أكثر الأنماط التي أعشقها من الروايات: تحليل أنفس البشر وأسلوب تفاعلهم مع بعضهم بعضاً تحت ظروفٍ غير اعتيادية.إن كنت من متابعي مسلسلات الأنمي اليابانية، فيمكنني أن أشبِّه لك هذه الرواية بإحدى أشهر سلاسل الأنمي الجديدة وأكثرها تداولاً بين الشباب، وهي مسلسل Death Note (مفكّرة الموت)، فجو القصة وأحداثها الرئيسية تماثل تماماً المنافسة بين بطل المسلسل (لايت) ومحقق الشرطة (إل) وتذاكي كل منهما على الآخر. لمن لم يشاهد المسلسل، فيمكنني أن ألخّص القصة الرئيسية للرواية بسهولة دون إفسادها عليك، ففي واقع الأمر.. ستكتشف القصة كلُّها تقريباً بمجرَّد أن تنهي فصلها الأول (أول 20 صفحة تقريباً)، لكن إن كنت حريصاً على أن لا يفسد عليك أيُّ شيء، يمكنك ببساطة تجاهل ما سيأتي أدناه.الفكرة الرئيسية هي أنَّ بطل الرواية شاب مُعدَم شديد الفقر، يدعى راسكيلونوكوف، كان قد ترك عائلته التي نشأ معها بقرية ريفيَّة صغيرة، ليهاجر إلى سينت بطرسبرغ (واحدةٌ من أكبر مدن روسيا في حينها وحتى الآن)، حيث التحق بالجامعة لدراسة القانون. لكن وبسبب حالته المادية السيِّئة فسرعان ما يضطر إلى ترك الجامعة، ويصبح عاطلاً عن العمل ويغرق في ديونٍ كبيرة. في أملٍ أخير، يقرر الذهاب إلى عجوزٍ مرابية ليرهن عندها مقتنياته الثمينة، مقابل قروضٍ مالية بسيطة. في إحدى زياراته لها، يقف متأملاً في منزلها ويأخذ بالتفكير: كن من الجهد قد يحتاج الأمر لقتل هذه العجوز الهرمة وأخذ أموالها الطائلة؟ ستتلو هذه الفكرة البسيطة صراعات نفسية وأخلاقية طويلة جداً، ستكتشفها ببساطةٍ من عنوان هذا العمل الأدبي العظيم: الجريمة والعقاب!"
"622",621,"Elaine","I remember loving this in college, and even calling the guy I fancied Raskolnikov -- he seemed mysterious and daring. Now I am finding the main character harsh and depressing. I think Dostoevsky knew what he was talking about."
"623",622,"Janely","This is an amazing Novel, I am absolutely in love with it and recommend everyone to read this book. It is absolutely wonderful and this is a type of book you want to keep forever and re-read. At first, I wasn't confident I was going to enjoy this book but I was so wrong. Fyodor Dostoyevsky is an incredible author and I am looking forward to read many more of his books."
"624",623,"Samantha Newman","Another book I read in high school. Most people I've talked to seemed to say they didn't like it as much as I did, but I doubt that I've talked to that many people about it, because it's an amazing book. I think Dostoevsky can be tough to get through, probably b/c he was a complete genius. I want to read his other books. I've heard so many people say that his books are their favorites.Anyway this book was pretty amazing. It had a plot and ideas in it that at the time I had never encountered, and it was all presented so fascinatingly. The ending surprised me but I guess it shouldn't have. Anyway it's an amazing character study, life study, idea study. I found myself casting it for a film. I'm sure it's been done. But maybe not well."

"628",627,"Cahlen Humphreys","Definitely a 5 star book. Dostoyevsky proves to be one of the most important authors in modern history. If you like/love Tolstoy as much as I do, then sit down and read Crime and Punishment. Dostoyevsky distinguishes genius from madness, and dreams from reality seamlessly but with enormous imagination. You're taken to the heights of axe-murdering to the gulags in Siberia within one book. I can't give this story enough praise. "
"629",628,"Livros","Não há palavras para falar neste livro. É necessário lê-lo!"
"630",629,"Shriya","There are books, whose very size, intimidates you, and yet, you do have to read it, because your favourite celebrity ever (for me that was Daniel Radcliffe) has read it as early as when he was 16. So, to do away with that feeling of incompetence, you pick up a book like this one and start reading it.Crime and Punishment, where do I even start? It's long, yes, it seems to go on forever, true; but it is ONE hell of a book you simply can't keep down. While reading it, you're simply not you! You're Raskolnikov, who is full of bitter madness towards a world he sees crumbling before his eyes, full of exploitation, misery and despair. You're Sonia, who is forced to prostitute herself to feed her family and whose only consolation is the Bible. You're the crazy, funny, drunk Razumikhin who finds it easy to fall in love and who suspects nothing. The best part of the book is how Dostoyevsky is this completely different person who is narrating the story to you and as he does, he has little comments on his own characters and the incidents in the novel, something, that makes you feel he doesn't really always side up with what his characters are doing. What I loved and what haunts me still about the book is its narration. Seriously, there's nothing MUCH in the story itself! It's just how it has been told. This book, above all others I have ever read, made me feel how powerful and wonderful almost ANYTHING can sound if the narration is right and how there's philosophy and poetry hidden in the most mundane and day to day activities of human life, music hidden in misery and a sweet artistic charm in sadness, too. A book to die for, Crime and Punishment is something I will HIGHLY recommend!"
"631",630,"Katrina","I finally finished Crime and Punishment this evening, I have loved this book and have discovered an author I would like to explore further.This is a highly readable novel focusing on the psychological reaction of a murderer after his crime. As I've said before I was shocked that the murder was so graphic in a classic, but the murder itself was such a small part of the novel. Like in 'The Red Room' the guilt and suffering is overwhelming, and we are drawn into Raskolnikov's private turmoil. The supporting characters are all well developed and hold their own stories alongside the main story of the novel. I particularly Sonia, she reminded me of a character from a Dickens' novel, someone of a low position who is given a voice, but like Dickens Dostoevsky felt the need to make her into a kind-hearted tart.I've read and loved a few other Russian classics, such as War and Peace, but have struggled with the various names used for each of the characters, this I didn't find such an issue in this novel as there isn't too much variety in the names used for each character and also the smaller number of characters featured in this novel. I think this might be my favourite read of the year. "

"637",636,"George","I picked up Crime and Punishment on a friends suggestion. I figured that at 26, it was about time I grew up and stopped avoiding the classics, and he thought it'd be the easiest read for a casual reader like myself.He was right. Crime and Punishment is timeless. I've never loved and hated a protagonist at the same time quite like I did Raskolnikov. His inner turmoil is the centrepiece of this work. Though morbid, through committing the highest crime imaginable, he discovered that he was not the person he thought he was - and he suffers as he finds out just who he is and what he really wants. Dostoyevsky's chosen narrative style is just completely perfect for this purpose.And that's just the beginning. There's so much going on in this book from so many characters, all of which are fleshed out on their own and play a crucial role in the narrative. I've never read another book that all comes together so perfectly well.PS: I read the Sidney Monas translation, which is not very popular. I highly recommend it, if you can get your hands on it. It's very good."
"638",637,"Kevin","“Crime and Punishment” is Fyodor Dostoevsky’s classic of sin, guilt, punishment, and forgiveness. Following Rodion Raskolnikov, one of the most morally ambiguous antiheroes written in literature, the novel is a engrossing character study of this intellectual murderer as he commits a gruesome crime against an elderly pawnbroker – which leads to a gradual descent in psychological deterioration and overwhelming guilt. Dostoevsky affirms himself as a master of the human condition with his dark pathos and disarming prose. "

"641",640,"Roy Whitman","Raskolnikov commits a most heinous murder of his pawnbroker, Lizaveta, and concocts a theory of the Extraordinary Man in history who is allowed to commit even murder for the greater good of mankind. It is only after his arrest and struggle with his own conscience that he comes to see the ways of his error and wish to repent and achieve salvation while in exile in Siberia. Raskolnikov abandons his Nietschean theories for the humility of Christ. This was Dostoyevsky's most sensational novel written like many of his works over a period of time in the weekly Russian newspapers, keeping ordinary Russians spellbound like some nineteenth-century soap opera."

Si no lo fueran, les sería difícil salir de la rutina. No quieren permanecer en ella, y yo creo que no lo deben hacer». F. Dostoievski"

The venom of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood; in their paths are ruin and misery, and the way of peace they have not known. There is no fear of God before their eyes."" It's a gritty tale of the poverty-stricken Raskolnikov who commits murder early on and battles internally with the overpowering guilt of the crime. The characters and their interaction with each other are so well developed it's engrossing. The tense scene of the reading of the Lazarus miracle is sticking with me. Is there any redemption or hope to be found here? Great book!"

"653",652,"Steve Evans","Think something is wrong here as ""Leo"" was not Dostoevsky's first name but it was Tolstoy's! However trusting that this book is the genuine article and there has been some mistake here...I read the Garnett translation last year as an e-book long after my high school reading, and could remember practically nothing - obviously I wasn't ready for it then. To me it is the first of Dostoevsky's great novels, not only because of the interest in the Raskolnikov theory of criminal rights, but for its contrast with Svidrigailov, who practised more than Raskolnikov preached but nonetheless committed suicide despite wealth, arrogance and the freedom to do as he liked.The description of the alcoholic is perhaps the best in all literature, with an understanding that penetrates to the heart of this unfortunate condition (I am a so-called ""recovering alcoholic"" so know something about this).Overall this is a book about conscience and its slow, grinding working on the guilty human personality. I am not sure that it is true of a lot of criminals, and Dostoevsky portrays some of these in his quasi-fictional House of the Dead - some people just lack the conscience to feel bad about what other people find quite deplorable behaviour. In my thriller about Russia The Russian Idea, that includes discussion of Dostoevsky, the villains are well and truly beyond this sort of thing...but I try to keep an open mind about it!The true heroine of this book, Sonia, is a wonderful human being."
"654",653,"Bruce","I have read this all the way through twice and skimmed it a few times. like most classics, there is a mass of propaganda spewed over what this book is and isn't supposed to mean, the themes, and the motivations of the main characters. Luckily, Dostoyevsky tells such a raw and engrossing tale with a memorable cast, that it dwarfs its hype. I expected this to be a chore when I first read it, but after page 33 it flew by and I was sneaking it around at work. "
"655",654,"Wolfgang","Non sono all'altezza di parlare di questo capolavoro, ma lo faccio comunque. Perchè? Perchè questo libro mi ha cambiato.Non ho mai letto molto prima di questo libro. Accidenti! Non leggevo nulla! Per me leggere è sempre stata un'enorme perdita di tempo finche nelle mie mani non è arrivato il caro Fyodor.Non so quale forza astrale mi spinse a chiedere disperatamente a mio padre di comprarmi la versione modalità ""mattone"". Un volume spaventoso che malgrado l'aspetto nefasto mi avvinse. Due anni fa circa se non di più sarebbe stato il mio primo grande MATTONE di libro, una sorta di ostacolo da valicare per dimostrare a me stesso di essere... no, vabbeh. Volevo leggerlo, semplicemente.Feci bene, benissimo. La miglior cosa di sempre.Cosa avrei fatto senza Delitto e Castigo? Senza Rodiòn?Sarei rimasto un'ameba. Sì, un'ameba.Questo libro mi ha iniziato alla lettura. Lo lessi la prima volta in 4 giorni senza capire nulla della parte psicoanalitica, ma la storia mi aveva assorbito l'anima e non riuscivo a capire come lo scrittore riuscisse a descrivere così magnificamente ogni cosa. Ci provai anche io, fallendo. Ovviamente.Successivamente, il senso di colpa per non aver colto qualcosa (a very deep unexplicable feeling) mi portò a rileggerlo e ne rimasi fulminato. Durante la prima lettura ero riuscito a travisare talmente tante cose che neanche sapevo se ne potessere fraintendere così tante in 677 pagine.Solo in quel momento io capii la GRANDEZZA. Questo libro mi ha portato a leggere molte altre cose soprattutto filosofia, ma anche classici. Fu così che mi innamorai dei classici e un mondo si aprì ai miei occhi.Non capisco come la gente si permetta di vivere senza aver letto questo libro (sto enfatizzando)Con mia gioia assoluta pochi giorni fa ho dovuto (meglio 'potuto' dato che non ne vedevo l'ora) rileggerlo per scuola e ho avuto la possibilità di soddisfare questa mia propensione all'affermazione di me e, nonostante avessi letto e riletto quel libro, solo dopo essermi ritrovato a dare spiegazioni alla gioventù a me circostante ho capito altre cose sulla storia, sui personaggi, su Dostoevskij.Amo questo libro perchè è un continuo insegnamento. In evoluzione nella storia. Eterno.(a questo punto ci starebbe bene un 'amen', ma non ho capito dove questo mio commento voleva andare a parare, forse da nessuna parte. Volevo compiacermi, volevo pensare ad alta voce.)"

I didn't understand that this was a product of the madness of the protagonist an upon this realisation, I found myself flying through the book with abetter understanding of the plot and the characters (either that, or I bought a poor translation). I think the book offers fascinating insights into post-Emancipation Russia and I enjoyed the philosophical digressions. Well worth a read."

"665",664,"Mb","Masterful. "
"666",665,"Mi","A psychological debauchery of ideas, emotions and hypochondria that will drive the reader mad, if not witless! It provides access into the mind of a criminal who doesn't consider his act a crime, and thus feel no remorse for it. Makes you think and wonder: What is crime, really? And does punitive action really appease a guilty conscience? The main character is at the same time the narrator, which made it a bit confusing (for me) at the start of the story. There is a lot of narration and monologue, and shifts frequently between reality and imagination. All the characters in the story play intriguing roles that build up the protagonist's mental derangement, and later help resolve his inner conflict. It is amazing how this book is still as relevant to present-day society as it was at the time of its first publication, which was ages ago. I should say this is a must-read piece of work as it is highly thought-provoking and somewhat entertaining. These Russian lit classics are truly goodreads!"
"667",666,"Mt","Truly a masterpiece and the foundation of existentialism. Dostoyevky's theme (as carried out by Roskolnikov) that there are only followers or criminals resonates throughout human history. And, that in examining criminals (or perhaps more specifically, crime), there exists either those who have successfully transformed society (for better or worse) or those who are merely petty criminals.I recommend this as an introduction to (a) Dostoyevksy and (b) existentialism."
"668",667,"Alina Fabozzi","This book was a rough read. Unfortunately, I left the USSR too early to get a good education, so I had to read this book in English.

Dostoyevsky is a good friggin' writer. "

"671",670,"Alyssa","Dostoevsky masterfully enters psychology, morality, philosophy all in an intensely interesting murder story, choosing a narrative style which is intimately tied to said murderer's conscious. Here my love of Dostoevsky began. <3"
"672",671,"Sam L","Reading this was much less of an ordeal than I was expecting. Dostoyevsky often gets put in the same basket as Kafka, but as far as I can make out he has far more in common with fellow Russian authors like Gogol and Bulgakov. Given how the whole book revolves around the guilty conscience of protagonist Raskolnikov following his murder of an old lady for reasons of personal ideology I can see why Dostoyevsky is commonly associated with existentialism, but ultimately I think C&P is better off taken at face value, without all the baggage associated with that philosophy. A brilliantly rich black comedy."

"674",673,"Cynthia","The philosophy is brilliant, but the writing itself, at times, is lackluster. I typically want my author to love language as much as I do. The brevity, and what amounts to a style of no verbal beauty (at least in English lol), but only the simplest use of words possible to express an undeniable intellectual elegance and power- I'm certain- was purposeful. About all that yellow: If the idea is to replicate the beating of the horse in Raskolnikov's dream, it is a brilliant note or joke. My inclination is to think it is an overbearing metaphor, about which, as a reader, I cannot help but feel a little insulted. Brilliant or insulting? I have no idea. The end I found to be a little disappointing, but genius, all in all."

"680",679,"djamb","www.folhasdepapel.wordpress.comHá momentos em que gostaríamos de ter tempo para ler de assentada todos os livros que temos em espera e de ter tido oportunidade de conhecer alguns autores mais cedo e este, meus caros leitores, é um desses momentos. Depois de tantos anos de ter ouvido falar de Fiodor Dostoievski e de o ter abordado por alto em aulas de Filosofia e Sociologia, finalmente chegou o momento de ler uma das suas obras de referência que, estou mais que convencida, foi o primeiro de muitos livros deste autor há de me passar pelas mãos.Com um olhar incisivo sobre a natureza humana, Dostoievski acompanha o drama de Raskólnikov em Petersburgo, um jovem que mata uma velha agiota e a sua irmã num episódio delirante. Mais do que narrar o percurso que o protagonista percorre numa luta consigo mesmo, Dostoievski expõe-nos uma personagem sólida e coerente que, mais do que tridimensional, é dotada de alma e de consciência (tema o qual é explorado de forma muito curiosa e cativante por António Damásio e David Lodge, numa tentativa de compreender o processo pelo qual os autores passam para dotar as suas personagens de um enorme realismo e humanismo - mas este tema fica para mais tarde).Complexo, sensível, autêntico, Raskólnikov luta com os seus fantasmas desde o momento em que pondera a hipótese de matar a velha numa tentativa de melhorar a sua vida ao lhe roubar o dinheiro que fazia ao se aproveitar da miséria alheia. É curioso perceber como o castigo do protagonista começa ainda antes de cometer o crime, o que reflecte claramente a presença de uma consciência e da capacidade de distinguir o bem do mal, e como a sua penitência aumenta exponencialmente de dia para dia. Ao longo do tempo, e a cada virar de página, o autor explora esta luta interior e partilha connosco todos e quaisquer motivos para tanta dor. Afinal, qual foi a causa do crime e com que luta Raskólnikov depois de o cometer? Vive arrependido por ter tirado duas vidas ou vive apavorado por ser descoberto? Enquanto coloca a personagem a desesperar por uma solução numa perspectiva 'micro', o autor consegue nitidamente gerar dúvidas na mente dos leitores de forma mais lata. É a exposição da sensibilidade da natureza humana em todo o seu esplendor.Num contexto social altamente sensível, o protagonista carrega a sua cruz sozinho enquanto tenta sobreviver parcamente na Petersburgo do século XIX, cenário o qual acaba por adquirir qualidades de uma personagem: pode ser visto como a causa (e não apenas contexto) para o crime cometido e como companhia do nosso protagonista enquanto deambula pelas suas ruas à procura de uma solução. Neste devaneio, enquanto se perde no seu dilema, vamos conhecendo a sua família e amigos de forma gradual, o que atribui solidez e realismo a toda a narrativa: vamos conhecendo as pessoas e as suas histórias à medida que Raskólnikov as procura, sendo esse contacto o momento de introdução de novas personagens.Em poucas palavras, 'Crime e castigo' é um livro apaixonante que deve ser lido com olhar crítico para ser devidamente apreciado. As minhas próximas leituras serão, sem sombra de dúvida, obras deste autor, que é reconhecido pela sua capacidade de expor tão delicada e, ainda assim, cruamente, a natureza do Homem."

"685",684,"Giulia","I absolutely fell for Dostoievsky's writing. ""Crime and Punishment"" seems to me like a perfect novel to catch a glimpse of Russian literature. Compelling, aesthetically pleasant and thought-provoking! "
"686",685,"Bhavye Aggarwal","Crime and punishment considered by many as the magnum opus of Dostoevsky, graphically essays the tragic tale of murder, guilt, suffering and redemption, unfolding in an utmost dismal setting of St. Petersburg of the mid-19th century.The central character of the story is Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikoff , a man with little means oftener found lost in reverie gets possessed with an idea, a theory of his own about ‘ extraordinary men being above the law’, and in order to bring ‘’ new thoughts ‘’ into the society they have a moral license or authority to even deprive a man from his basic right to live . He then sets out to put his theory into practice and as a consequence murders an old woman. The story gyrates around this murder. Through raskolnikoff Dostoevsky provides an in-depth exploration of the psychology of a criminal. The inner world of Raskolnikoff, with all of its doubts, deleria, second-guessing, fear, and despair, is the heart of the story. Dostoevsky does not lay emphasis on the actual repercussions of the murder but the way the murder forces Raskolnikoff to deal with tormenting guilt. Indeed, by focusing so little on Raskolnikoff’s imprisonment, he seems to suggest that the actual punishment by law is much less terrible than the stress and anxiety of trying to avoid this punishment. Further through the portrayal of extreme guilt, suffering accompanied with love Dostoevsky paves the way for raskolnikoff’s redemption from the crime committedNot only raskolnikoff but other characters especially the soft and timid Sonia, the beautiful and strong-willed Dounia, the quite enigmatic Svidrigailoff , the shrewd and astute magistrate Porphyrius are also very eloquently painted by the author. The novel has all the ingredients of an engrossing read."
"687",686,"Anas  Alhaisony ","""Great men smash laws. Smash old ways in order to create new ones.Great men are not afraid to be criminals.""This is the short-cut that an intelligent student wrote about a theory he was expounding , referring to extraordinary men being above the law, since in their brilliance they think “new thoughts” and so contribute to society.Anyhow, He then sets out to prove his theory by murdering an old pawnbroker and her sister.Some words that toughed my feelings: ""I killed only a filthy money-lender.A louse.I'm only going to confess because I am a cowered. A mediocrity...I have not killed any children.I have not raped any young women.I am not part of any advanced army , separating children from their mothers,wives from their husbands.What Dostoevsky is really trying to reveal is not the crime its-self or the punishment that the criminal deserves from the law , but indeed it's the psychological analysis that goes beyond the crime which torturing the murderer which evokes his humanity and make him either to confess his crime or become simply insane. What I really love about this novel is that Dostoevsky is trying to reveal something about the human condition which is "" The more we intellectualize, the more imprisoned we become."""
"688",687,"Friedrick","It might be twenty years since last read C&P. I thought I knew this book, but now it seems I knew nothing. I reread it now because I was interested in the character of Svidrigailov, having just renewed an acquaintance with Banville's Axel Vander. Is it just grey hairs that opened my eyes to Dostoevsky's novel this time? I don't know; I'm still processing it. But it was well worth rereading again."

"690",689,"Matt Micucci","The feeling I got from reading this is that Dostoyevsky no doubt had a painfully revealing understanding of human nature and its mind's psychology. And whether or not it is a fact to be frowned upon, I identified with his lead character all too well..."
"691",690,"Katsumi"," From the beginning to the end you watch as psychological forces eat away at the thoughts and actions of their victim causing him to finally confess to the hideous crime he has committed. The story is basically the struggle between Raskolnikov's theory and his conscience which make him confess to his crime. Dostoevsky's genius is in describing how Raskolnikov struggles in his thoughts and actions. His thoughts become increasingly disjointed and desperate and his actions show that he has an increasing need to escape the uncertainty of being convicted, to talk about the crime, to confess, and to suffer for his crime. It is even at times humorous the extent to which Raskolnikov at times becomes confused in his bungled yet undiscovered crime."

"693",692,"Shayantani Das","In the novel Namesake, Ashok’s grandfather tells him to always ‘trust the Russians’. Damn good advice he gives him there. Every piece of Russian literature I have read till now is adequate proof, and this novel just reaffirms this belief. What irks me though is that, it took me so long to discover Dostoyevsky. Anyway, now that I did discover him, I plan on reading every thing he has ever written. (Same pinch Tarun, he he)The novel depicts the journey of Raskolnikov, the main protagonist. After losing his position in the university due to lack of funds, he becomes a prey to all the new ideas floating around in Russia at that time. He thinks that he can rationalize murder, and not feel any guilt and the whole book focuses on this journey from arrogance to repentance. Dostoyevsky is deliberate in his criticism of hyper rationalism. He also successfully explores other themes like women sacrificing themselves for their family (Dounia and Sonya), and the hypocrisy of individuals in letting them do so (Dounia’s mother and the Marmeladovas). Along with Raskolnikov, he has also done a good job in developing other characters. Svidrigailov especially, was a very very interesting character (almost as much as Raskolnikov himself). Loved the cat and mouse games between Rodia (that’s Raskolnikov) and the police inspector and the dreams and the meaning behind them.After all this praise perhaps it’s not logical of me to whine about the names. But I plan on doing so anyway. Why is a person mentioned as Razmikhin in one scene an as Dmitri Prokofich in another. Is it not enough to have teeth shattering names in the first place? But, no, they have to have 3 part names, and nick names too. So a person is called Luzhin in one scene, Pyotr Petrovich in another (try to say that 5 times quickly). Also, out so all the numerous Russian names out here, one character has to be named Zametoff and another Zosimoff. One is called, Porfiry Petrovich another Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin. Also, this book can really use an editor. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED though, totally worth the hard work and patience. "
"694",693,"Nick Hawryluk","Protagonist is very well drawn. Memorable characters. Interesting take on human condition and 'new-age' philosophy. I wish the editor of the edition I read wasn't so heavy on the footnotes- some parts even referred to events that hadn't happened yet in the book"

"696",695,"angela","Todos los veranos me propongo un reto en lo que a lecturas se refiere. Bueno, no todos, puede que este año haya sido el primero, pero ¿qué más da? Por lo general suelo decir lo típico de ""este verano aprovecharé para leer mucho más de lo que he podido leer durante el curso"".Sin embargo, estas vacaciones la cosa cambió. Dado que gran parte de mi tiempo libre iba a pasarlo metida en la biblioteca, estudiando para recuperar las asignaturas que me habían quedado para septiembre, el tema de la lectura estaba un poco más complicado. Lo único que se me ocurrió ante tal panorama fue, no retarme a leer tropecientos mil libros, sino a comenzar Crimen y castigo de Dostoievski y acabarlo antes de la llegada del otoño.La edición con la que yo contaba era del Círculo de Lectores del año de María Castaña, lo que implicaba que las letras eran minúsculas y que el interlineado todavía no había sido descubierto. Lejos de echarme para atrás estos pequeños detalles, me entraron más ganas de leerlo, de demostrarme que podía con un tocho así. Sin embargo (y ahora es cuando me quito el poco mérito que tiene leer al señor Friodor), todo fue coser y cantar, muy en contra de que pensaba en un principio.Si bien la primera parte (hay seis en total) se me hizo algo pesada, fue pasara a la segunda y sentir una urgencia irrefrenable por saber qué pasaba a continuación, por conocer cuál iba a ser el siguiente movimiento de Raskólnikov. Y es que, a pesar de lo minúsculas que podrían ser las letras y de lo extenso del libro, la historia que narra atrapa casi desde el primer hachazo que el protagonista le da a la vieja usurera. Dostoievski traza una senda a través de las distintas fases emocionales y psicológicas que Rodia atraviesa tras llevar a cabo el asesinato, y lo hace de manera magistral, como sólo un genio sabe hacerlo.Crimen y castigo no es un libro en el cual vayamos a encontrarnos con una trama digna de novela negra, desde el principio se sabe quién, cómo y cuándo ha llevado a cabo el asesinato. Lo que Crimen y castigo hace es conducirnos a través de la psicología de un personaje extremadamente misántropo con unos aires de grandeza que ve cómo poco a poco su talento se va consumiendo entre las cuatro paredes de la ruinosa habitación que alquila con el poco dinero que sus madre y hermana pueden mandarle. El castigo al que hace referencia el título no es otro que el castigo que el mismo Raskólnikov se impone de manera inconsciente, la sensación de nerviosismo, de desprecio, de confusión que tiene en todo momento, la necesidad de autoconvencerse de que todo va bien, de que no tiene nada que temer aunque sabe que el más leve indicio puede llevarlo directo al fracaso.Pero no todo queda en el protagonista, en torno a él giran otros personajes de igual complejidad, cada uno con sus propias cargas y pesares: Sonia, Razumijin, Dunia... y Svidigrailov. Éste último aparece casi al final de la novela y desempeña un papel decisivo en ella. Es el antagonista que no llega a ser del todo malvado, hasta sus actos resultan humanos si nos paramos a reflexionar sobre ellos, sobre todo si se tiene en cuenta cuál es su final y lo amargo de éste.La verdad es que me alegro de haberme propuesto leer este libro antes del 21 de septiembre (aunque haya apurado hasta el día antes), porque Crimen y castigo es una obra redonda, se mire por donde se mire."

"698",697,"Tammy","I read this book about a year ago and it still ""haunts"" me. It was a real life changing book.

I will be reading it again someday."

Crime and Punishment is an in-depth exploration of what it means to be an unstable young intellectual with all the makings of greatness...and none of the emotional maturity to attain it. This theme speaks to my generation and at least the previous two American generations.More than that, the book has it all: crime, philosophy, love, comedy, drama, suspense, historical perspective. Dostoyevsky took a picture of St. Petersburg and made an incredible story. I will avoid and spoilers and say to any lovers of literature, I can't recommend this book enough. "
"702",701,"Gizem","ilk başta ön yargılı olduğum fakat daha sonra beni içine çeken defalarca okunabilecek muhteşem bir eser:)"
"703",702,"Erick Mártir","One of the deepest analysis about human nature. Dostoyevsky portrayed a tormented being, compelled by his inner drives and desires to commit murder because he felt in a superior position. It was like getting inside Raskolnikov's very complex soul and get involved in the moral questioning he maintains throughout the book. This was one of the books that made me think differently, it's a masterpiece all along."
"704",703,"Eva","I positively adore this book. It is quite possibly my favourite book in the entire world, an impressive feat.The perspective in this book was amazingly done. Through the prose, the madness of Raskolnikov became very real and relatable; it almost seemed as if you were going mad along with him. The description of his room was something that provided depth for his madness. Svidrigailov's madness, though of a different flavour, was also convincing.The only character who I had a problem with was Sonya. She and Raskolnikov didn't spend that much time together, it seemed, before she decided to go to Siberia with him. I suppose there just wasn't much to leave-- Raskolnikov had told her, harshly, how what she was doing was in vain, how there wasn't a future in St. Petersburg for her. It still seems odd that she would follow him to Siberia, but in the moment with the way it was written, it didn't seem odd at all.There was a religious theme in the book, but I felt that that was actually very secondary to the main message of the book. The main message, to me, seemed to be an exploration of guilt on the human mind. It was more that Raskolnikov had to be forgiven by himself and Sonya-- someone he cared about. In the book, Sonya seems to turn him to religion, but I don't think that that was the main message, or at least not how I chose to interpret it.I think Dostoevsky is an excellent writer, not that that is a very controversial opinion. His style is, of course, a bit melodramatic, but that's to be expected. He is, after all, Dostoevsky."
"705",704,"Eve","The first one I read from Dostoyevsky. I was only 14 and it was the age where doubting in everything started to flourish in me. I do think that the book added a lot to my charachter. Every time I reread it, the cruelest and striking part was the dream with the horse...Shiver goes down my spine even if I think at it.... "
"706",705,"Mimi","A book that was incredibly impactful upon me and my journey to Orthodoxy in college, I was in many ways nervous to return. Just as wonderful the second time, although I'd forgotten how very Dostoevskian it was - my memory had glossed over those parts."

One is closely connected to the psychology of the main character and one goes up and down with his hopes and despair. Crime and Punishment did put Dostoevsky at the forefront of Russian writers when it appeared in 1866 and rightly so. It is one of the most famous and influential novels in world literature and I do now understand why. Though it has been written 150 years ago, the story will get under your skin and will fill your mind rapidly. "
"712",711,"Ron","I read this book for a 6 week Sierra College class on Dostoevsky. It's considered a classic in literature and requires a great deal of thought and discussion to understand the plot, characters and dozens of twists and turns the story takes. One of the darkest books ever written and a great look into the misery suffered by the Russian lower classes during the populist uprisings of the 1850's. Great book but very difficult to read."
"713",712,"Ivan Izo","Read three times. Will read again. Not a lot happens and yet a lot happens. It's a tragedy and a comedy. Raskolnikov is rich and impoverished; an intellectual and an idiot. Great ending."
"714",713,"Julián"," Hace más de un año que guardaba este libro en mi biblioteca. Sentía que no estaba preparado aún, y razón no me faltaba. Es difícil condensar las ideas y enseñanzas que el gran Dostoievski dejó en este libro -mostrando la psiquis humana de una forma increíble-, así como también los sentimientos que expresó, desde aquella experiencia propia en Siberia.  Es un libro muy duro, sirve para entender cómo era la época de la Rusia zarista, pero al mismo tiempo sirve para entender a nuestra sociedad actualmente. Las clases baja y media, sumamente estresadas y con muchos menos privilegios que la clase acomodada, pasan por la ignominia de quebrantar la ley como consecuencia de ésto.  En el libro Raskólnikov justificó el hecho de matar a la usurera diciendo que había matado a un ""parásito"" (a causa del mal que había causado por su avaricia), y al ser un librepensador, no quería alejarse de su teoría de que existían personas ""comunes"" y otras que no lo eran, las que debían desobedecer la ley para cumplir con sus objetivos (según él, ""nobles""). Realizando aquel asesinato, trataba de encontrar a qué categoría pertenecía, descubriendo que él no era más que una persona ""común"", y más adelante, redimiéndose de sus pecados con Sofía Semiónovna, encontró una nueva vida (nótese el valor existencial que Dostoievski le otorgó a la religión). En fin, un libro que deja incontables enseñanzas y que nos pone a pensar hasta el punto de dejarnos asombrados."
"715",714,"Aban","At the first glance, a title such as “crime and punishment” could catch the attention of the reader and then it brings to the mind the simple interrogative question that what is the crime and what is the punishment afterwards, by which Fyodor Dostoyevsky introduces his novel to us. This point should be admitted that we are not presented with kind of a straightforward novel, one that we clearly know the motives that drive the crime and the exact punishment of it. Crime and Punishment is a story about sort of a moral dilemma and a confession which twists the reader's mind in many directions and at the very end we could hardly say this is the first and the last interpretation of this novel. Rodion Raskolnikov, the novel's protagonist, commits two murders based on his theory that in some particular instances, particular persons who are intellectually higher than common people, have the right to kill worthless persons on utilitarian grounds. After committing murder he goes through a hard emotional and mental crisis and becomes more and more alienated from society. We may think because Rasklinkove has an intellectual character and this is in itself kind of a burden on his shoulder and consummates him so extensive that then just the very act of putting his theory to the test could unload him emotionally and psychologically. but if we base our analysis upon this explanation, then how could we explain Raskolinkov's confession in police station when there doesn't exist any fact and evidence against him? And then what's the function of his mysterious and ironical confessions to different persons at different intervals? Are we granted by novel's discourse to suppose that his confession has a religious function?generally speaking, confession has deep roots in religious beliefs and it has been recommended in different religions. But it also could be investigated psychologically and since there are different readings for this novel, it is more logical to consider this viewpoint too and explain these confessions on the basis of both of them, i.e. psychological and religious vantage point.The religious analysis of Raskolinkov's confessionNearly right from the beginning we know Rasklinkove doesn't believe in God and all through the novel he challenges his friends' beliefs at different opportunities. At different hysterical moments, he struggles to confess his crime to different persons, but he fails to articulate himself clearly until the moment he confesses clearly and completely to Sonia, who is a person with common religious beliefs. Actually, the true cause of this trust in Sonia is not because she is religious, but because she is good-natured and could bear and accept others' beliefs which are rather different with her own. as it was mentioned before, Raskolinkov is an atheist, a utilitarian one, who also during a conversation with Sonia mocks her belief in God and wants to challenge her beliefs so that she understands that even sacrificing herself forsake of her family is a great sin.at the end of the novel, to Sonia, he explains: “Did I murder that old woman? I murdered myself, not her! . . . [I]t was the devil that killed the old woman, not I."" and Sonia says to him “Go at once, this very minute, stand at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss the earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say to all men aloud, ‘I am a murderer!’ Then God will send you life again.” after hearing these remarks, Raskolinkove says “You mean Siberia, Sonia? I must give myself up?” and Sonia answers “Suffer and expiate your sin by it, that’s what you must do.” after changing these words with Sonia he immediately goes to police station to confess his crime but he suddenly and unexpectedly gets informed that Svidrigaïlov has shot himself, so shocked by this news, he leaves there without confessing and sees Sonia with kind of a “look of poignant agony, of despair, in her face,” at front of himself and for the second time goes to the police station and confesses to his crime.Although through the trial's process he says to the judge that repentance was the reason for his confession, but the same day that he goes to police station to confess, he says to his sister, Dounia, “I am going at once to give myself up. But I don’t know why. . . .” This indicates that he still doesn't consider the act of murdering as a crime and justifies it on utilitarian grounds. at the end of the novel, at the epilogue, we perceive that he still considers himself innocent and the narrator represents us with his state of conscience : “Oh, how happy he would have been if he could have blamed himself! . . . But he judged himself severely, and his exasperated conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past. . . ."" Even when he finally begins reading the bible which Sonia gave him at his request for it in the prison, there is not any evidence that he's faith in God. He takes the bible up MECHANICALLY, as if he is encountered with an inevitable process by which rebellious souls gets surrounded to the common sense reasons for reading bible, or for believing God. So for another time, we are represented with a metamorphosed version of Darwin's theory of the ""survival of the fittest"", that here the fittest is defined and conditioned by common sense or governmental authority. Although based upon the novel’s discourse, it seems psychological function of confession is more powerful than the religious one and could be traced word by word through whole of the work, but it seems that novel’s discourse’s created an alloy in which it is difficult to separate the psychological from religious material. On the whole, it’s felt that reading the novel just from a unique viewpoint turns all the faculties and powerful points of the it into a wasted effort and destroys all the hopes to claim that as a great one. This religious aspect of novel in some ways could be connected with the psychological aspect in such a manner that there is room to claim that the whole episodes concerned with religious beliefs are contrived in a way that at the end we could interpret the protagonist’s mental struggle to confess mostly as a psychological one.The psychological function of Raskolinkov’s confessionIt must be a wonderful trust to know that it was discovering the significant role of confession that gave birth to Sigmund Freud’s Psychoanalysis. Freud noticed that those patients who speak to another person about their private dreams, memories and problems get their mental health very sooner than others Crime and punishment is also mainly the story of confession, and this confession as the focal point of the story could be twisted in many different ways. Reading between the lines, the reader comes to this conclusion that what flows under the surface of these all incidents and dialogues of characters, is the manipulation of a criminal psych.Psychologically speaking, our protagonist is a smooth and intellectual criminal, an alienated youth, a melancholy and poverty-stricken ex-student, who is capable of killing to regenerate himself, anew. This regeneration begins during the very time when Raskolinkov passes his time mostly in a silent and dark garret, when he has nothing to eat, and little by little gets the most dangerous impressions of a solitary and secluded life, the dangerous idea of becoming a superman. At last he plans a detailed crime to kill the old pawnbroker woman. After committing the crime, he justifies his crime on utilitarian grounds but this is just a temporary excuse not a potent one, which at intervals calms his mental struggle down for a short time. It is fear that like the cerebrospinal fluid flows in the backbone of the novel and in long time moves the story along. This fear dominates the novel and is the major drive which causes our smooth criminal to confess. Raskolinkov, at the end is a new human who has been regenerated from this fear. He is sort of a criminal who at the time of going to the pawnbroker woman’s house, avoids strangers’ looks and always suspects his friends of knowing his secret. He interprets the mimic of others’ face as a sign of being caught in a hidden trap. What causes this kind of thought is the psych of our criminal who lives in an omniscient state. He thinks all the world know his secret, so he goes to different peoples and speaks of his secret in a fractured language to test their knowledge, and sometimes to unload his mental pressure. We learn at the end of the novel that if he delays to confession, it is because he can’t stand himself have been stripped of that glorious cover of that specific pride which is the main cover of a wretched person like him in rages. When he becomes sure that there is not enough evidence against him and the persons who know him as criminal never betray him, he finally confess at police station and maybe because this is again fear which drives him to confess. When he gets informed of Svidrigaïlov’s suicide, the fear of death becomes more tangible and this is the very moment which he finally confesses to his crime. Meanwhile, Porfiry, the intelligent attorney, asks Raskolinkov why he doesn’t confess and says to him: “Why, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of? . . . ‘Ach, hang it!’ Here we are represented with another drive of confession. As it was already mentioned, Raskolinkov is a rebellious young man, one who is against the conventional standards of social life, so he makes great strives to show his disgust at social labels by which his hesitance to confession may causes for himself. It’s possible to analyze his confession as a glitzy show of his morality as an atheist murderer who accepts the failure of his theory and ideals, one who confesses just because of the fear of being considered as a timid man by persons who know his secret. At another time, Profiry irritates Raskilonkov by involving him in speaking about the murder and at the end he says to Raskilonkov that your confession eventually comes out naturally and this is the master key of that door which leads us to the philosophy of the confession in novel. So confession is inevitable and the criminal’s psych at any condition needs it to live a new life, the very life at the other side of the prison’s wall which awaits Raskolinkov and what if he avoids confession and lives with his secret at the bottom of his heart? Besides it’s very hard to stand this secret, it’s also impossible for a human being to be indifference to the interior mental struggle of himself/herself and does it possible to live in such a way?"

I loved it then and I love it now, but I think for entirely different reasons. I'm currently reading it again and I still like it and I always hope that my students understand how awesome it is!I can't remember when I finished it, but I still love it. I am going to commit classics blasphemy and say that I think it is flawed, but really, the writing and the imagination and the iconic characters really put it way above most other literature I have ever read, anyway!

"718",717,"Alessia","Delitto e Castigo è uno dei più celebri scritti della letteratura mondiale e le ragioni sono infinite. Nonostante sia intriso di pensieri e ragionamenti piuttosto complessi spesso impliciti, mascherati dalle vicende e dai pensieri del personaggio, lo stile è scorrevole e mai pesante. Si può leggere la storia in due chiavi diverse: seguendo le vicende vere e proprie come se fosse un romanzo poliziesco, oppure cercando significati e spiegazioni profonde, quindi come un romanzo psicologico/filosofico. I temi trattati dono sempre attuali; si analizza infatti come si possa raggiungere la salvezza attraverso la sofferenza, quale sia il ruolo della fede negli animi degli uomini, ciò che spinge davvero un uomo (in questo caso il protagonista) a compiere un delitto e ciò che succede in seguito, il pentimento, l'orgoglio, la paura della morte e quella di non raggiungere il proprio obiettivo di essere qualcuno, il fallimento, la miseria... Insomma, questioni negative che portano ad un finale totalmente diverso ma molto, molto significativo, tanto da essere uno dei principali messaggi del romanzo. È necessario dare molta importanza a tutti i personaggi, poiché ognuno è l'incarnazione di un'idea, di un modo di vivere e seguendo il suo percorso vengono alla luce molte particolarità importanti e ricche di significato. Possiamo dire che quest'opera è in grado di andare fino in fondo all'animo umano, metterne in risalto i difetti, le ideologie perverse e i principi che danno vita a conseguenze molto spesso disastrose.

Roskolnikov wants to commit a petty crime which results in murder. The author brilliantly explores the mental processes of an criminal who, for all his moralising about the society and criminality, cannot shake out the guilty consciousness which leads him to go back to the scene of crime. One of the greatest novels ever written. "

"727",726,"Walter","""Crime and Punishment"" is the best psychological thriller ever written. 19th Century Russian novelist Feodor Dostoyevsky wrote the story of Raskolnikov, a Russian college graduate who makes his living tutoring current students and doing odd jobs. In the process he meets an old lady who is essentially a loan shark, and he plans to kill her and take her wealth. He does so, and in the process he also kills the woman's sister who walks in on the crime. The novel is brilliant in that it portrays the demented mind of the criminal. At first Raskolnikov rationalizes the crime by thinking that he is doing the world a favor by ridding the world of this horrible woman, and by using her riches for good instead of evil. After the crime Raskolnikov can do nothing but try to ease his mind of guilt. He goes through incredible mental tortues as he struggles with what he has done. The novel also makes known to the reader the unexpected sources of grace in Raskolnikov's life. Raskolnikov's friend, a worthless drunk who dies during the novel, is his only supporter. After his friend's death, the friend's daughter Sonia takes care of Raskolnikov. Sonia turned to prostitution in order to support her family, and despite her status as a prostitute she is the most moral and loving character in the novel. Sonia literally becomes the salvation of Raskolnikov. It is quite fascinating.Within the midst of this drama, the mere fact of living becomes difficult for Raskolnikov. He can't concentrate on his work and is questioned by the police. He barely holds up. When his sister asks him for his blessing for her pending marriage, Raskolnikov goes off on the fiance. But his most difficult opponent in this novel is himself. I would highly recommend this novel to everyone. This is really something that all readers should discover."

I am glad that I did, as this book truly deserves to be a classic. Once you get into the story and familiarize yourself with the characters' names, the novel makes a compulsive read and despite its fatalistic title, I found the book unexpectedly humorous at times.

I have never been so impacted by anything that I've read. This doesn't feel like a book, it feels like real life. Like you've stumbled into one of the darker corners of reality, and now must accept whatever happens next. Read it frequently enough, and by the end of this book, you ARE Raskolnikov. You amble through your monotonous daily life feeling disturbed, guilty, and paranoid.  This book spoke to me on a very personal level, and here's how:  I used to be an elitist, and a cynic, just like our friend Raskolnikov. Reading this book gave me an ugly glance at what kind of person I was in the past, and what horror it could have evolved into, had I continued to allow myself to believe that I was superior..... Basically, this book changed my life. I would recommend in to any advanced reader, especially those with an interest in psychology. "

I read this back when I was 15 or so for Honors English in high school, so I had little memory of the goings ons. I did find that last sentence peculiar in how Dostoyevsky seemingly leaves is story open for continuation. Karamazov had that same sort of ring at the end, so I suppose it was just something the author liked to do."

A must read for anyone interested in the classics. a story still current today (empoverished students still exist), Intense psychologial questions still not answered today but still as controversial.The nature of crime has always been a posed question. Set in the very dark yet enchanting backdrop of st Petersburg in Tsarist Russia we explore the nature of crime excellently. I study Criminology and to me this classic novel explores the nature of crime better than any textbook I have ever seen.Including tragic alcohol addiction, haunting discriptions of life in Siberia and looks into the past this is the very definition of a 'timeless classic'. Ultimately this should not be missing from any book shelf"
"753",752,"Yuliya Kozheporova","The best of Dostoyevsky!"
"754",753,"Priya K","A great piece of work.... Intriguing, psychological drama of suspense, with splash of every human emotion possible. "
"755",754,"Ben W","Crime and Punishment. As the title indicates, this novel is about a man and his crime (in this case, a double homicide), as well as his punishment. However, the bulk of the novel is focused on the conjunction ""and"". The crime occurs quickly and yet the (judicial and social) punishment does not come until the very end of the novel. Indeed, it appears in the Epilogue. The protagonist Raskolnikov commits the murders, believing that he is a superior person, one who considers himself above the law, and is subsequently tormented by his inability to become a ""genius"" or a ""superman"". He is psychologically disturbed and his outward appearance is that of a indigent or drunkard. Even following his confession, he does not consider himself a criminal; he does not find himself to have acted immorally.As in his other novels, Dostoevksy (Dostoyevsky) has created numerous, varied, and memorable characters."
"756",755,"Paul Gelsthorpe","Dostoyevsky's most famous novel is perhaps one of the finest pieces of writing I've ever had the privilege of enjoying. The story focuses on the murder of a pawnbroker by the novel's protagonist Raskolnikov. The young man personifies all the traits Dostoyevsky associated with the nihilist movement who were beginning to gain influence throughout Russia in the mid 19th Century - generally speaking he embodies secularism and a move from Russian orthodoxy and Christianity to the 'godless' atheism/nihilism of what ultimately became Russian socialism, thus the ability to justify a cold blooded murder in the absence of any real moral compass. He is a tormented bundle of conflicting, half formed ideas and justifications, just like elements within pre revolutionary Russia.The murder is committed as a reaction to news that Raskolnikov's sister Dounia is marrying a man he feels unsuitable, essentially to secure the financial stability of her family, including Raskolnikov who is studying Law in St Petersburg and living in appalling poverty. Raskolnikov is able to commit the crime as he sees his victim as a 'louse', a money hoarding, washed up old woman with no value to society. Money would seem to be the primary motive, but as the story unfurls we learn there is far much more to it than that. What unfolds is one of the best examination of a gamut of human feeling (paranoia, suspicion, fear, guilt, the search for meaning / redemption in life and in some part, love) that I've ever experienced. Raskolnikov's madness is written brilliantly. I often got cold shivers / sweats when reading some of the passages and it's a testament to the power of the writing that such strong physical reactions were provoked. Indeed, Rasko's pre-murder dream about the flogging of the horse is almost as terrifying as Hippolyte's shocking dream in 'The Idiot', although I have to say, the latter still ranks as my 'favourite' Dostoyevsky pant wetting moment (actually both amongst the most shocking passages I've experienced in literature). St Petersburg features strongly in the novel, acting I feel as a suitable psycho-geographical backdrop to the descent into madness. It is a City orientated towards Europe, not the old Orthodox Russia and is as such portrayed as a turbulent melting pot of stinking taverns and eateries, poverty, prostitution, floods etc. Place is really important in the book and I feel it's used to emphasise Raskolnikov's moral uncertainties and those that Dostoyevsky feels are challenging Russian Orthodoxy. The setting imbues the novel with a sense of uncertainty/suspicion, and even a surreal tone at times. Although the narrative is essentially formed from a crime thriller / detective story, it's brilliance lies in it's examination of the psychological tensions that would be troubling someone who had just committed a murder. Unlike other novels with similar themes, very little time is afforded to the crime or investigation itself, rather, the bulk of the narrative consists of Raskolnikov's mental breakdown before and after the crime, and the subsequent attempts to reconcile the murder with his own soul. Ultimately, Raskolnikov confesses, in submission to the mental torment of having to live with the guilt of committing such a bad crime. He senses redemption in the idea that he will be suitably punished for the act.For all his admirer's, I am often amazed at how Conservative some of Dostoyevsky's ideas are. He was sending Russia a warning about it's slide into a potentially godless, chaotic future where ideas of 'wrong' and 'right' are jumbled. In that sense, the book is essentially anti-atheistic and perhaps event somewhat reactionary given the climate it was written in. Still, like all of Dostoyevsky's novels extremely powerful and important points are made about human nature and changes in 19th Century Russia. It's a brilliant book. "
"757",756,"Ajay Ajay","It's not a classics, but a sheer thrill to read a story of a man, who lands in Siberia, remembers his days in Russia and then his multifaceted outlook to the world.  Dostoevsky is an amazing writer!"
"758",757,"Nathanael","I love Dostoeysky! This book does get at the heart of man; being evil in nature and yet the evil can be mended by a higher form of love. Every action has a reaction, pick up this book and read it today!"

"760",759,"Vinicius Castilho","Li ""Crime e Castigo"" logo depois de ler ""Os Irmãos Karamazov"" e a comparação foi inevitável durante toda a leitura. ""Os irmãos..."" me prenderam muito mais, sobretudo pelo clima de romance policial e pelo fato de que, ao contrário de em ""Crime..."", o suspense quanto ao assassinato se arrasta e se arrasta e se arrasta, quando no segundo tudo é revelado prontamente (até antes de abrir o livro, já no título). Duas formas bem diferentes de desenvolver um enredo: construir o caso, montar as evidências, adicionar reviravoltas para finalmente revelar (ou não) a verdade versus mostrar a verdade de cara e construir toda uma narrativa sobre as consequências morais, psicológicas, legais e todo o conflito resultante disso tudo. Entretanto, ao terminar a leitura consigo ver claramente o motivo pelo qual CeC é considerada a obra-prima de Dostoievski. Apesar de ter achado Raskolnikov um dos personagens mais chatos, mimados, e, muitas vezes, até meio infantil (desculpa, gente), é inegável que ele é também brilhante e talvez sua grande questão esteja justamente em (não) saber lidar com uma mente tão genial em uma cabeça tão confusa."
"761",760,"Aziz Zabidi","Betapa kompleksnya menjadi manusia. Betapa sedih menjadi manusia yang dibebani kebijaksanaannya sendiri. Dibebani kesedaran sendiri bahawa kemanusiaan adalah sesuatu yang perlu dipertahankan namun pada masa yang sama memerlukan penderitaan paling tidak munasabah. Melihat manusia-manusia lain menjalani kehidupan dengan bersahaja tanpa tanda-tanda bahawa mereka menyedari sepenuhnya hakikat takdir sebenar manusia.""I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity"" - Raskolnikov.Itulah sekurang-kurannya yang saya pelajari daripada Dostoyevsky di dalam novel klasik ini.Dari sudut lain, saya mengkagumi ketelitian gambaran kehidupan abad 19 di Russia yang ditulis Dostoyevsky, dialog-dialog yang bijak dan bersifat filosopikal, kesedaran tentang hal-hal psikologi manusia dari sudut-sudut paling tersembunyi, kuasa kesedaran moral, nilai kepercayaan dan cinta. Oh novel ini sangat kaya. Mungkin tidak berlebihan mengatakan seseorang itu belum cukup lengkap kemanusiaannya selagi belum membaca novel ini. ""Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth"""
"762",761,"Pirkka","I like the way Dostoevsky describes everything so hmm over realisticly. And the greatest punishment is not the punishment that the court can give you but rather your own punishment."
"763",762,"Katie Ann","I got this book for my birthday two weeks ago. Despite the intimidating 521 pages, I flipped to the first page. Next thing I knew, it was 7 days later and half the book was read. Another week passed and here I am writing a review for this astounding book. How you ask, did I finish the massive book? I owe it all to the outstanding writing of Fydor Dostoevsky. His thrilling novel on poverty, crime, agony, and the study of a murderer is intriguing and causes you to think of things you never dreamed of before. His examples of the guilt and agonies of a criminal are fascinating. But what I most enjoyed was the theme of freedom and the value of life. The character's pride and effort to fight for his freedom was interesting and when he finally gave in to punishment, he found that it is in captivity when we value life the most. I will never forget this excellent book, Crime and Punishment, and what it has taught me. I will also never forget Fyodor Dostoevsky, and I assure you, this is not the last book of his I will be reading."
"764",763,"jim","Whew! What an amazing book. Like Les Miserables, it takes on the question of morals and responsibility for one's actions and makes you squirm. It's long, but worth the investment. Hardly a week goes by when I don't think of it."
"765",764,"Tanya Lolonis","I read this twice during my undergrad years -- first, for a seminar, and soon after a second time, out of sheer pleasure. Disturbing and compelling, it pulled me in and along. One of the wonder books of my early 20s."
"766",765,"Greg Deane","Fyodor Dostoevsky’s Crime and PunishmentRaskolnikov confessed that “I wanted to make myself a Napoleon, and that is why I killed her…” He wanted to see if he could rise above a sense of guilt when he rid the world of a moneylender, Alena Ivanovna, he identified as evil. Though his bid to be a conqueror of old ways and ideas is complicated by the additional murder of the moneylender’s backward sister. Further complications confuse Raskolnikov when his conscience is challenged by the values of the religious Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov, a virtuous woman forced to prostitute herself to support her family. Her meek, easily embarrassed temperament makes her a spiritual antagonist to Raskolnikov, whose intellectual arrogance and godless amorality cause him to be ruthless. Her shame contrasts sharply with his pride.While Sofya prostitutes herself out of indigence, Raskolnikov, who is also and lives in shame off his poor mother and sister he is too principled to use the moneylender Ivanovna's savings, even hiding a handful of trinkets before fleeing the scene under a rock. He likes to think he is above pecuniary self-interest, that he is a type of idealist who gives the little money that comes his way to those poorer than himself. It may be that Dostoevsky is offering a tragic parody of early communist revolutionaries who sought to change the world into a better place through acts of violence. His generosity of spirit is witnessed by his friend Razumíkhin, who relates that Raskolnikov risked his life to rescue children from a burning home.Dostoevsky offers a professional opinion in the form of Zosímov, Raskólnikov's doctor, who believes he suffers from hypochondria and There are ways in which Raskólnikov’s humility contradicts this diagnosis. Perhaps Dostoyevsky carries his point too far when he describes Raskólnikov’s moods, mutterings and dissociation, so implying that he is schizophrenic, his delusions broken by lucid periods like the one in which he plans his murder.This ""point"" of Raskolnikov’s crimes is plumbed by Porfíry Petróvich, the examining magistrate, who also serves as a priest confessor who offers Raskolnikov a sympathetic opening, even though he is also his nemesis. Petróvich’s equips himself to understand Raskolnikov through familiarity with an article he wrote dividing mankind into two categories: the masses, for whom laws are written; and great men, men of ideas, whose power puts them beyond the laws of God and man. In time, Raskolnikov appears to abandon this theory and so approach the road to his own redemption. "
"767",766,"Whitney","I always appreciate works of fiction where I feel as though the author has looked into my mind and soul, found something relatable, and implanted that into their protagonist. I think anyone who reads Dostoyevsky feels that way, and squirms a little bit."
"768",767,"Victoria Dawson","Masterpiece. "
"769",768,"Meegan","Although, this book may go a little slow for some readers, it is truly an amazing book. There are some great themes on love and redemption. I cried at the end, which I don't do for a lot of books."
"770",769,"Alisa","I read this book in tandem with Their Eyes Were Watching God for the summer reading AP English whatever. While at the time (and now too I think) there are some things about this book that went completely over my head, I absolutely loved it. I hate to admit but I think I developed some sort of weird crush on Raskolnikov, even though he's a...well a bit off. (I blame the cover, which is not the cover shown here, he looks rather fetching in the one I own) and the fact he is Russian.On to something about the actual book? The inner monologues in this were fantastic, I think that's what I liked most, getting inside people's heads; especially people who aren't exactly all there."
"771",770,"SCARABOOKS","Romanzo che ha una potenza tossica. Produce effetti velenosi sull'umore. Sembra un liquido di contrasto che ti invade per via endovenosa e ti fa vedere arterie mentali altrimenti invisibili. Denuda. Scava. Ha qualcosa di archeologico. Ho pensato ai calchi pompeiani. Quando affiorava un osso umano, Fiorelli, il direttore degli scavi nell'anno in cui fu scritto questo romanzo, intuiva che attorno c'era un buco, lo spazio lasciato vuoto dalla dissoluzione del corpo di un essere vivente. Faceva un foro, iniettava nel buco la calce liquida e ne otteneva un calco perfetto, perfino nell'espressione del viso. Delitto e castigo è una cosa così; la sua storia è come quella calce. Raskolnikov è un calco perfetto. Porta alla luce costruzioni mentali antichissime ed universali, sommerse e insieme preservate dalle eruzioni storiche degli ultimi due secoli. In tutti e due i casi resti muto a pensare. "
"772",771,"Andrew Savinykh","All times Russian classic. I wonder why they make you read it in school when you have no capacity whatsoever to fully comprehend it. I tried reading it several time in the past 20 years, and now is the first time I actually enjoyed and appreciated it."
"773",772,"Hadeer Alobaidy","الرواية اكثر من رائعه تشتحق ان تقرأ اكثر من مره .. "
"774",773,"Kyla","I don't think I'll be adding anything new to what's been said, but here goes: it was amazing. I'm finding that I have a preference for existentialist fiction and misanthropic heroes, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with what that could say about me. Probably not good things... self-absorbed, too contemplative, indulgent, angsty, most likely young and impressionable, etc. Lots of unflattering adjectives. Anyway, that aside, I want to talk about how surprisingly humorous this novel was. I actually burst out laughing at many lines and situations... that were unintentionally hilarious in all likelihood. Everything is just so overplayed, everybody speaks so much, and the situational humor was striking. If you don't see the humor in Crime & Punishment, don't worry about it. (I have still yet to find someone who agrees with me.)All that said, I admired how Dostoevsky constructed his characters. I felt like I was sitting in their heads--John Malkovich style--for much of my time reading. In particular, how Katerina's plight developed gave me a new understanding of tragedy. Pity and fear, indeed. Also, how did Dostoevsky make a pedophile my favorite character? I don't have an idea, but it's certainly an achievement.This was fun for me to read. Humor, philosophy, psychology, ethics, absurdity, incredible characters, and existential crises abound. "
"775",774,"J.M. Hushour","The superlative novel, and it's not even his best. Yes, yes, I know you read it in 11th grade and loathed it, but it's time to try again, Texter. Hearken back to an age when people looked up when they walked around and contemplated murdering greedy pawn brokers while their monomaniacal world is challenged by the love of youthful prostitutes and family. The Pevear/Volkhonsky translation is supreme, and Dosty's prose is sublime in this, the first of his Giant Five, and , again, not even his best."
"776",775,"Kaitlin","Mind blowing book. Even though Dostoyevsky wrote in the 1860's, his insights about both society and the individual are very applicable to today.His character development is extremely intriguing; the reader continually learns about the main character throughout the novel. I love how Dostoyevsky created this developement in various ways. He did not just narrate their thoughts. The reader can almost learn more about a specific character by the way other characters act around that individual that by solely focusing on the individual himself. Crime and Punishment is definitely worth a second read!"
"777",776,"Vassilis","Stunning. Inner turmoil too passionate to restrain and love too pure to deny a brighter morning. The depths of nefarious creativity and reckless blindness. All the elements of a wonderful book and very infectious. Read with caution if you can sympathize with Raskolnikov. This is a classic for a reason. "

Probably not, so please don't kill me.As an ardent existentialist of the Sartrean variety it was only natural that I would fall in love with this masterpiece.

"782",781,"Kshitij","When Morality Totters...The novel brings you inside the deranged mind of the protagonist (the murderer). A theory of his own impels him to commit the deed (which is executed in a horrible fashion with an axe) which he blithely disregards initially as a crime. Do you repent after swatting a blood-sucking louse? There are two kinds of people: ""the ordinary"" who create, follow and bound themselves in an abstract circle of intangible confines that they call 'rules' or 'laws'. The world is full of such folks. The other smaller kind: ""the extra-ordinary"" are those who do not have a legal right, but an inner right spared by their conscience to take extreme steps that might be labelled as 'transgressing the law' by the ordinary which are taken for the fulfillment of their own ideas and executing their designs. Where is the scrupulous lot when a deserved is dethroned? Power is attained by those who dare stoop and pick it up.No moral or legal barrier should stand against an act done for greater good, even murder ought to be overlooked. If the death of an old bitter and wealthy crone would ultimately blow the breeze of betterment into the lives of many people, then will it not rather be an act of kindness?With his radical views he launches himself onto the world with the intention of putting the theory to test; sniffing up the air, searching for a prey. When the object is identified, he boldly plans for it and gingerly executes it. The aftermath of this incident is unbearable agony falling upon his soul; the raging conscience of his own refusing to mollify the wildfire tormenting him. (view spoiler)[Quite the contrary to his understanding of future events and my liking he eventually succumbs to confession that puts him behind bars in Siberian Jail. (hide spoiler)]Particularly the character of the protagonist written by Dostoyevsky stood as a flickering flame in the blackness pulled over by some extreme radical doctrines propelling the Russian youth for virtuous violence back then.The plot might not appeal to everyone, and would rather seem a lacklustre and heavy psychological read to many. The more one trots on, the more disturbing it becomes. But I sincerely was glued to the book, and despite the stress it made on my mind it was an inexplicably good voyage over the tumultuous waters of this grand piece of Russian Literature."

I feel like this book was a collection of one awkward situation after the other. The love of a father for his daughter with a twist. The love of a step mother for her children, but not quite. The redemption of a lady of the streets, and a murder you cant help but root for, all come together to make a GREAT story! I was mesmerized by this story! Read this book!"

"792",791,"Victoire","We read this in AP Literature, I enjoyed the book however I would have enjoyed it more if I wasn't being forced to read it. I enjoy Russian literature and Dostoevsky's writing style is very intense, complex, and thought provoking I have never written so many essays or read so many articles about any book before and I still feel that we only scratched the surface. The only plus is that because of Socratic seminars and essays I can pronounce and spell almost every name in the book! Yay! "
"793",792,"Thành Trung","Một tác phẩm kinh điển về tội ác của con người. Khi đã cầm lên là không thể ngừng đọc, khi đã đọc xong thì không thể ngừng nghĩ về nó. Với hình ảnh trung tâm là một tên sát nhân đầy phức tạp và mâu thuẫn, những diễn biến bất ngờ lý thú, cùng vô số những triết lý không thể sắc bén hơn, Fyodor Dostoyevsky đã tạo ra một thứ gần giống thuốc gây nghiện, làm người ta bị hấp dẫn, choáng váng, ngỡ ngàng, say mê. Cuốn sách hoàn toàn thuyết phục tôi bởi những ý nghĩa sâu sắc không bao giờ cũ dù hàng trăm năm có trôi qua."
"794",793,"Michiel Verhaeghe","Misdaad en straf is zo ongeveer de beroemdste detectiveroman uit de wereldliteratuur, geschreven met een geweldige handicap voor de schrijver: de lezer weet wie het gedaan heeft, en wordt toch in voortdurende spanning gehouden of de dader gepakt wordt of niet. Zelfs mensen die niet van Dostojevski houden bewonderen dat boek. Zo heeft Ivan Boenin een keer gezegd: ""Al die krankzinnige Kirillovs, Svidrigojlovs, ivan Karamazovs kan ik niet uitstaan. Al zegt de hele wereld me dat het geniaal is. Ik kan het niet hebben en daarmee basta! Ik weet zeker dat ik gelijk heb maar Dostojevski heeft prachtige dingen. Het armoedige, donkere, koude Petersburg, regen, modder, lekke overschoenen, trappen en katten. Die Raskolnikov die met een bijl onder zijn jas de trap opklimt naar die oude woekeraarster. Dat is geweldig."" "
"795",794,"Ana-Maria","""Crime and Punishment"" is one of my top-books. I can say for sure that this book is remarkable not only by its action, but because of its characters. The psychological analysis is memorable, is the best I have ever read. It makes you feel you are in Raskolnikov's shoes, that you are in his conscious, that you know exactly how he feels. And this is amazing for a book!"

"798",797,"Philip Lane","I was half expecting a Russian version of Law and Order but it turned out to be more like The Talented Mr Ripley. I thoroughly enjoyed this murder story which we see from the perspective of the murderer. Raskolnikov is obviously a disturbed man who has failed to live up to his expectations and this leads to his becoming a criminal. Despite believing that he is in some way above the law he descends into doubt and guilt thus meeting out his own punishment. Will he be found out by the authorities led by Porfiry (who inspired the writer of Columbo) or not I provides the suspense for most of the book. There is a fair amount of action despite the mainly psychological nature of the book and a warning to animal lovers, there is a most horrendously brutal scene with a horse towards the beginning. In comparison to Dickens it is quite sparse in humour but delves deeper into the protagonist. It kept me enthralled throughout.i can't imagine how I have never read it before."

"802",801,"Apatt","Thank goodness this book is in the public domain where I can grab a PDF version for some intensive copying and pasting of the Russian names. The protagonists' names are hard enough to remember, but names like Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov have me reaching for the white flag.Plot-wise Crime and Punishment is fairly straight forward, an impoverished young man murdered a nasty old woman and her sister but afterward finds that he can not live with himself; after suffering some extreme anguish of the soul he begins looking for redemption. The simple synopsis belies a psychologically complex book. This is an entire character driven novel, full of psychological insights and profundities. To me, the most difficult aspect of reading this book is the writing style which is eloquent and evocative but most of the characters seem to speak in extraordinarily long monologues, pontificating, ruminating, philosophizing, wringing their hands like nobody's business. However, once I got used to this I became captivated by the protagonists and their plights. Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov is a wonderfully complex antihero, I was appalled by his act of murder which seems like some kind of weird experiment to test his very odd theory about what an intellectual is entitled to do, especially if he compensates for one evil act by doing numerous good deeds. While Raskolnikov is front and centre of the story, the novel is not entirely about him, the supporting characters also have very hard lives of their own. Particularly Sonia (Sofia Semyonovna Marmeladova) the poor girl who sells herself to feed her family and eventually finds love and respect in the last place you would expect. All the characters are very vividly developed, even the villains of the piece are not the mustache twirling types with Machiavellian schemes. They are just horrid, odious, selfish, manipulative men, the sort you meet or read about all too often in real life. There is Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin who never murdered anyone but is so cruel, arrogant and selfish that I wish Raskolnikov had administered the same axe treatment to cure him of his personality. Then there is Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigaïlov who is a pervert, possibly a pedophile, yet also some kind of antihero yearning for redemption.This is not a book to read if you are looking for a good giggle, but if you are interested in contemplating faith, redemption, conscience and morality it is the very thing. It would seem ridiculous if I said that reading this book has made me a better person, the trouble is the truth is sometimes ridiculous."

"810",809,"Mike Motto","Great book. Indescribable writing style."
"811",810,"Siya","Bearing in mind that I only just finished reading this book yesterday, it's perhaps a bad idea to review it today. Why? Because I'm still so deeply affected by it!Let me start by saying that, as a result of having grown up in a post-socialist country, my generation was taught that Russian..everything was rubbish. In our compulsory reading lists, there featured many foreign a work, but none originated from the Russian Federation. At the time, I wasn't too phased by it; but after a few years, I concluded it must have been a sly political move. As if renouncing our history would change much. Never mind. I promised myself that I would one day read certain Russian classics. The highest rating I can give to this book is five stars. I'll go ahead and give it six. In writing, for it isn't possible to do so otherwise. I was well aware that it would be a heavy, heavy read. However, I don't think I imagined it would be that heavy. As soon as I started it, I made a distinct parallel with certain French authors I'd read in the past. The likes of Victor Hugo and Honoré de Balzac, to be more precise. I'd say that this is a character-based book. About 95% of it is concerned with, what totals, a month / month and a half. You can, by that, deduce that the focus isn't on the plot. Or, it is but in a direct link to the psychological, mental and emotional state of the protagonist. The protagonist..Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov is someone whom I should, in theory, dislike hugely. Yet, I find myself sympathising with him. Why? I have no idea. A part of me refuses, point blank, to accept that he's a deranged, twisted and calculating bastard. Another part of me is convinced that he is. A third part of me is in agreement with the possibility of him actually being insane. And at this very moment, I can't make my mind up. I don't have a preference for one, or the other. The depth in which Dostoyevsky explores human nature, with all its failings, is simply extraordinary. A person's ups and downs, highs and lows, triumphs and tragedies are described in the most shattering of ways. Happiness and sadness, love and hatred, admiration and disgust, certainty and doubtfulness, honesty and mistrust among other roller-coaster human emotions are presented to the reader in a masterful manner that manages to cause confusion, empathy, ironical laughter and shaking one's head in disapproval. Rationality creeps into it, too. Sometimes. It's probably this weird mixture of rationality and irrationality that has left me baffled, numb, speechless.. Everything follows one single event; an event that turns the protagonist's existence, and the existence of those close to him, into a downward spiral. Realism in its finest.For the book is primarily written from the protagonist's point of view, it is his thoughts you hear. That is not to say that there's any form of I-narrative, really. It's sort of neutral but subjective, if that makes sense. Also, it is other characters' thoughts that are put forward sometimes, which then allows you to see a situation from a completely different angle. Lastly, a third party altogether seems to be narrating all along as well. Which, in short, contributes to writing style versatility and an overall greater effect.Since I'm running the risk of writing on and on, I'll end this review here. I realise it hasn't been very coherent but I've done my best! I highly recommend this book! "
"812",811,"Valeria","Io amo questo autore, ogni suo romanzo è un capolavoro. Storie appassionanti, personaggi talmente umani ed attuali che sembra che saltino fuori dalle pagine. Il delitto perfetto escogitato da una mente superiore. Se si può riuscire a scampare alle leggi degli uomini, si può riuscire a nascondersi anche dalla propria coscienza? Un capolavoro, davvero imperdibile."
"813",812,"Kusuma","I read this book in AP English my senior year of high school, and I've read it probably 8 times since then. It follows in the tradition of a lot of existential novels that aren't necessarily plot-heavy but filled with such copious amounts of emotional torment that they really require a nap after reading. I found the antagonist, Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov (gotta love the name) to be altogether repugnant and charismatic. In such a faraway place and a long-ago time, the thoughts and feelings of a destitute murderer were a thing I never thought I could relate to, but this book actually kind of makes it possible. I've always enjoyed books where all materialistic distractions are stripped away enough and the human condition in its barest form can be revealed (and what better place than a barren, economically depressed, cold-ass Russian town full of drunks???). LOVE IT.One recommendation: This novel is chock-full of nicknames and really long Russian names, so I always use a few sheets of paper to help me sort the shit out."

"815",814,"Guille","Bueno, pues me terminé ayer Crimen y Castigo, y tengo que decir que es uno de los mejores libros que he leído en mi vida. La manera de escribir es tan sublime que parece mentira que sea del siglo XIX. No sé, tampoco es que haya leído tanto, pero da la impresión de que Dostoievski estaba por delante de su tiempo comparándolo a otros grandes escritores de su época.Los personajes son completamente reales, humanos, parece que te estén echando el aliento a la cara cuando están hablando. Los soliloquios de Raskolnikov son simplemente magníficos. Hay momentos desgarradores en la novela como la escena de Catalina Ivanova en el puente con sus hijos. Las pesadillas de Svidrigailof son simplemente aterradoras. Las conversación de Rodia y Sonetchka en el momento más crítico creo que es la mejor parte del libro. Esa y el final (que no el epílogo).No se hace nada pesado de leer. Cada párrafo está tan bien redactado que se observa el cuidado y la buena mano del escritor y el cariño que ha puesto en ello. En fin, ¡que es una pena que se haya terminado! Pero como todo lo bueno, el libro tiene un final. "
"816",815,"Andrew Burford","A challenging read which plumbs psychological depths and questions the morality underpinning 'crime and punishment'. I found the brutal killing and attendant emotional turmoil both disturbing and fascinating in equal measure and the abundant food for thought truly marks this book out as a classic. "
"817",816,"Greg Sidor","One of my favorite books. I know, it's kind of dark, right? I think it's the perfect psychological thriller. This could only be a novel - the depth of the main character's delusions can only be explained in print. The main takeaway: beware the brainy college dropout!"

It seems this book has drawn a superior rating across the universe. It was although, evidently a great novel"

"821",820,"carnival","Reading this book was an incredible experience. Perfect creation of a murderer, opposite to a conventional stereotype. The main character, instead of all his drawbacks, makes the reader be fond of him and even understand him in some way."
"822",821,"Joshua Rooney","An interesting story written in a very unique way. At times certain paragraphs or chapters seemed to go on for ages while other themes or parts of the story seemed to not be developed enough (such as his actions/thoughts before the murders, however this didn't distract much at all from the overall genius of the. The casual reader not interested in the extended analysis of the mental anguish/punishment from crime may find the book a bit too weighty. Personally I found it refreshing to find a book with such a different take on the typical murder story. "
"823",822,"Julian","I have difficulty rating this book. It was, of course, extraordinarily well written, and its subject matter was distinct.My biggest problem was with how little I could relate to the main character, and how depressing it all was. I could see the good in him, but he refused to see it in himself. There was no hope. The world was naught but a series of grotesque mechanisms made to set a man to his knees, buckling beneath its weight. And he buckled, and let madness slip beneath his honor and dignity to foster horror and baseness.I have a pessimistic nature on the surface, but I am an optimist at heart. The absolute resolve not to allow himself happiness in life was terrible to behold, to me, as a young man living through a similar point in his life. Loss is universal, as is loneliness, but one must still live the life one is given.And perhaps that is the genius of the piece. Dostoyevsky drags me kicking and screaming through the darkest thoughts of a man who has given up to remind me of the bitterest dregs of existence, and give me renewed purpose in leading a life filled with something more.And so, five stars."
"824",823,"Chris Chaplin","I had expected a somewhat dense, turgid story but it was far from that. After a slow start, this novel turns into an absorbing tale and - dare I suggest it - one of literature's first psychological crime thrillers. Although some of the female characters are a bit two-dimensional, the main male characters are cleverly drawn, human, complex and fascinating. The main character, Raskolnikov, is somewhat of an anti-hero and is quite frustrating - though very believable - in his obtuse reactions to others, but my favourite character is Porfiry Petrovich, the detective in charge of the crime investigation.The melodramatic style was not to my taste, but I guess it was typical of mid-1800s literature (think Wuthering Heights). More problematic, in my view, was the overtly Christian conservatism that coloured much of the novel. Nonetheless, this was a towering, masterful novel that really broke boundaries in world literature."

"827",826,"Kimberly Lantz","A trajectory-changing novel. 	The moment in this book in which I felt most engaged and as if I understood clearly what was going on is when Raskol thinks about the letter from his mother about his sister’s courtship with Luzhin. Raskol thinks to himself about Luzhin’s desire to marry a girl “‘raised from destitution and owing everything to their husbands’ bounty . . . ’” In this quote, I find that Raskol is frustrated because he sees a parallel between Luzhin and the pawnbroker: they both, according to Raskol, abuse those who are powerless. The reaction against reason and logic reminds me of the counter-Enlightenment in Western Europe around this period. 	I adore the lecture by Irwin Weil. I am intrigued that he, too, found inspiration to learn Russian in a Dostoyevskii novel (The Brothers Karamazov). Doestoyevskii’s language contains so much thick, humid emotion. But I wonder if this is only the translation? I want to reread this novel using several English texts and the original Russian text, so that I may really see what Dostoyevskii meant, what he intended. "
"828",827,"Erik","In my opinion, an excellent translation. The story of a murder by a man is focused on the perpetrator's mind - dense passages of describing his inner torment await the reader. I found the prose to be faster reading than expected, with some interesting twists in the plot to keep one turning pages. Not sure who to recommend to except those who like Dostoyevesky or classic literature since I think many people might get bored if expecting something like the bulk of suspense novels being written today. I found the writing to be enthralling. "

"830",829,"Huw Evans","Raskolnikov, what a fabulous name that is. Roll the first letter around your mouth and spit the rest out from the fourth letter onwards. Is there a better name for a sociopath? He is a man whose brain is sufficiently differently wired to feel that he can do what he likes without consequence. Unlike most sociopaths he appears to learn that his actions impact on society and his immediate family and is redeemed by the power of love. Perhaps the consequences of his actions are attributable to the the connectedness of all things and his family are the natural targets of the vengeful Furies. In the end this is something for personal reflection. The writing is dense, graphic and dark. FD's ability to put his fingerts inside somebody's head and scramble your synapses is expert and this boook should be obligatory reading for anybody whose life involves personal interraction. "

"833",832,"Andrea Bovino","Immenso e intenso. Gli unici due aggettivi utili alla recensione di questo libro sono proprio questi. Dostoevskij descrive in maniera perfetta la psicologia di un delitto appoggiandosi su un romanzo tracciato minuziosamente senza lasciar scampo al non detto. Sorprendente come questo autore riesca ad utilizzare il giusto numero di parole in ogni situazione, dialogo, descrizione; non una fuori posto, non una di più, nè una di meno, mescolando la narrazione a sottili riflessioni. E' proprio vero che i libri formano i lettori. La lettura di questo testo mi ha fatto riflettere ed analizzare la psicologia umana da un punto di vista diverso. Come dice lo stesso autore, la sofferenza è la stessa causa della consapevolezza. ""Dir frottole a modo proprio è quasi meglio che dir la verità al modo degli altri; nel primo caso sei un uomo, nel secondo sei soltanto un pappagallo! La verità non ci scapperà, ma la vita si può massacrare; se ne sono avuti degli esempi. Ebbene, che cosa siamo adesso? Noi tutti, tutti senza eccezione, nel campo della scienza, del progresso, del pensiero, delle scoperte, degli ideali, dei desideri, del liberalismo, della ragione, dell'esperienza e di tutto, di tutto, di tutto, siamo ancora nella prima classe del ginnasio inferiore! Ci è piaciuto vivacchiare dell'intelligenza altrui, e ce ne siamo penetrati!"" "
"834",833,"Emadeddin","I consider myself one the biggest fans of the great Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky. I think his works has that very unique taste of beauty which can't be found anywhere else. Dostoyevsky is different. I read his novel Crime and Punishment before I read my favorite The Brothers Karamazov, and I loved it very much. I loved It's Protagonist ""Raskolnikov"". I loved the way the novel ended - I like that kind of ""open"" endings which allow the reader to be a writer! It opens thousands of windows and creates millions of roads in front of It's reader's imagination.This novel is definitely one of the greatest works of literature all over the world. It is worth reading - more than once."
"835",834,"Asih","Seperti buku Novel Rusia lainnya yang cenderung suram, buku yg satu ini sama aja.Cerita ttg mahasiswa miskin yang membunuh lintah darat dimana dia sempat jadi korbannya.Tapi cara berceritanya Bapak Dostoyesvky ini luar biasa,kayanya ceritanya itu benar-2 terjadi di depan kita.Setiap detail perasaan,setiap kejadian bener-2 'seakan-2' real."
"836",835,"Joe Leigh","Dostoyevsky once again turns fictional characters into real people and makes their lives incredible complex. Very long and slow, but the payoff is worth it. I was able to feel the emotions and mindsets of the characters, which is am amazing feat. The audio book version was a Constance Garnett translation, which is apparently the absolute worst version. When I go back for another round in 10 years, I would like to go with a Jessie Coulson translation, I can't even imagine how much better it might be."
"837",836,"Asia","Raskolnikov and Sonia forever <3I really liked the book, even though there were soo many paaages. The book made me laugh and go ""gasp"". There just should've been more Raskonia lovin'! Raskonia forever."
"838",837,"Writer's Relief","To label Dostoyevsky’s CRIME AND PUNISHMENT “a classic” or “influential” is an understatement. “Archetypal” is more accurate, not just in terms of Russian writing, but literature as a whole. Dostoyevsky revolutionized both psychological and philosophical novels, directly inspiring authors such as Knut Hamsun, Franz Kafka, and Virginia Woolf, among others.The protagonist, Raskolnikov, is a former student living in abject poverty who spends much of his time indulging in existential musings. Unable to afford sustenance and slowly becoming delusional, he murders an old woman and her half-sister for their money.In the days following his gruesome deed, Raskolnikov begins to crack beneath the weight of his guilt and the stress he feels as the police inch closer to identifying him as the murderer. He wanders through the streets of Saint Petersburg, frantically attempting to get his thoughts under control with vodka and interacting with all manner of people in the city. All the while, his two closest friends--Razumikhin, a fiercely logical ex-student, and Sonya, a young woman with strong morals that has been forced into prostitution--provide advice and desperately try to help Raskolnikov. In the end, Raskolnikov must decide whether or not to confess.CRIME AND PUNISHMENT is a fascinating look at the human psyche, one you are unlikely to forget. Raskolnikov, his companions, and the characters he meets along the way are masterfully created to the point that they seem real."
"839",838,"Cheri Vause","Dostoevsky's masterpiece of the irrational mind justifying the most heinous of crimes. We watch the descent of the perpetrator's mind into madness and how he is unable to admit when he's caught that what he has done is wrong. This is a must read for those who love the classics and a powerful story that is fraught with meaning."
"840",839,"Rodrigo Hinojosa","Best novel I've ever read, period. The way in which Dostoyevsky dives into the human soul, especially the tormented and guilty human soul is amazing, and the path it sets to restoration and redemption is amazing too. Highly recommendend to anyone who wishes to take a look into the depths of his own soul. "
"841",840,"Bgwb","Brilliant. My second attempt at reading Russian literature and the work that secured my fascination with the ""genre""."
"842",841,"Vladislav","Few books have made me think and empathize with greater intensity upon re-reading them as Dostoevsky's masterful delve into the human psyche, 'Crime and Punishment'. The book's venerable flourishes of the tongue do little to diminish its twisting exploration of insanity and vice, and its gripping characters that never intertwine, but instead vividly and painfully collide. It is undoubtedly a difficult read, made harder still by the layers upon layers of flaws bestowed on all participants - but becomes all the more human by doing so. 'Crime and Punishment' paints a ravaging road to redemption that will not just linger in memory, but leave a mark on a person."
"843",842,"Abhishek Ganguly","Nobody, other than Dostoyevsky, could have written 'Crime and Punishment'.Line by line, Dostoyevsky's troubled lines trickle down as he esplains the turbulent mind f a criminal and his volatile behaviour is escaping from law. Brilliantly characterized, Raskolnikov is a character that has lived through the ever expanding world of literature and will continue shining through for centuries to come.The brilliance of the narrative is that Raskolnikov has not been significantly victimized by his situation, rather by his guilt."
"844",843,"Real Supergirl","Read this for high school English class. It was one of the few novels I liked that I had to read. I found it fascinating, for the same reasons I went on to study psychology. It's a thorough psychological plundering."
"845",844,"Hristo","If you ever wondered are you capable of murdering someone and coping with it afterwards, Dostoevsky does some very good work here, analysing the psychology of the killer, his guilt, apathy and lust for life. His book also concerns some interesting philosophical themes such as determinism, nihilism and rational egoism. I'm giving it a 5 star rating, although there were few soap-opera moments which I found quite annoying. However Crime and Punishment has some serious cliff hangers - clever and intensive, and that's definitely how a psychological thriller should be written. With a risk to take the book's message on a superficial level - if you're planning to kill someone, read this masterpiece before you do it, so you can either give up on the idea or do it the right way with a minimal chance of being caught :)"
"846",845,"Lise","Dostoyesky's classic masterpiece about alienation."

Ce roman m'a ému comme seuls les chefs d’œuvre le font, il m'a fait versé des larmes et a su touché mon âme, ce n'était pas une simple lecture pour moi mais carrément une expérience qui m'a comblée au plus haut point. Dostoievski a su peindre l'âme et l'émotion humaine comme je n'ai jamais lu auparavant, il a crée des personnages authentiques et n'a épargné la description d'aucun de leur émotion fusse-il ressenti dans la plus banale des situations. Bref, un génie de son genre! Après ce roman et ""Anna Karénine"" je sens devenir fan de la littérature russe!"
"850",849,"Madison Mondell","6 stars."
"851",850,"Billie Pritchett","Raskolnikov is a young student who begins to contemplate a murder and carries out that murder. He toys with ideas at turns utilitarian or Nietzschean. The book touches on issues about how one should live, bold ideas of youth (with positive and negative consequences), and the role of religion or spirituality in one's life. I will say this about the book: if you're an impatient person, you might not want to read this book. This book required a lot of patience to read, and if I had it to do all over again, I might not have finished it. At any rate, if you like Russian novels generally, you'll like this, especially for its philosophical and emotional depth. "
"852",851,"Brendan","I read this a very long time ago and loved it. Looking back at it now, I was much younger, and I think I may have been too easy on Raskolnikov who is actually a bit of a b. I don't want to re-read it now because I fear I might hate it."
"853",852,"Nouf","Crime and Punishment is a great novel ...a masterpiece. I think that Dostoyevsky through his novel unraveled the different meanings of crime. For example, poverty (which is a social problem the author dealt with )is actually a crime! He wanted to drive the readers or the people’s attention to their superficial way of defining the word or act of crime and criminals...dealing with the question of what is meant by a crime. In the novel the murderer stated that : “ I fail to understand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honorable”. Another quote by his sister (Dounia) asking “why you have shed blood!”…he (murderer) replied: “ which all men shed, he put in almost frantically, which flows in streams, which is split like champagne and for which men are crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of mankind. Look into it more carefully and understand it!”. I think that this also can be linked to the people’s superficial way of defining ISIS. There are more than one ISIS in this world…let alone the ISIS of thought. As Dostoyevsky said: look into it more carefully and understand it!  Read the last quote from the last pages in the novel which is the murder’s dream when he was in prison. The murderer’s dream I guess is what Dostoyevsky foresaw to be the situation of our world today! “He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a terrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of Asia. All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. Some new sorts of microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes were endowed with intelligence and will. Men attacked by them became at once mad and furious. But never had men considered themselves so intellectual and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, never had they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their moral convictions so infallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoples went mad from the infection. All were excited and did not understand one another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched looking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung his hands. They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to consider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom to justify. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. They gathered together in armies against one another, but even on the march the armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken and the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting and devouring each other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long in the towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was summoning them no one knew. The most ordinary trades were abandoned, because every one proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and they could not agree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups, agreed on something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something quite different from what they had proposed. They accused one another, fought and killed each other. There were conflagrations and famine. All men and all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread and moved further and further. Only a few men could be saved in the whole world. They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race and a new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen these men, no one had heard their words and their voices”.I also liked his way of netting the struggle or the suffering of the murderer. Self struggle is something that the author stuffed with number of important questions about life, death, religion, society and etc. Also most importantly the question of morality ..principles. “But if one looks at men in all ways- are there many good ones left?”. "
"854",853,"Maica","As a whole, I found Crime and Punishment psychologically insightful. Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikoff was a personally alienated but intelligent student who broke the bounds of law. In his desperate attempt to prove his theory, he carried out the plan of killing an old woman usurer. However, I disagree with his theory that great people become famous as results of their crimes. He believed that he identified himself as one of those great people which gave him the right to commit a crime. In this case, my view is that, people of renowned achievement and leadership introduce new laws, new concepts and innovations to their society, but the fact and necessity of having to kill human beings are only means when there are people who oppose these leaders who are bringing about these societal changes. Therefore, Rasknolnikoff's reasoning about crime is flawed, since the act of killing precedes the changes he want to see in his society. And in the end of the story, he admits that he has 'failed in his mission.' "
"855",854,"Kurt","You hate how you relate to the main character so much, and he's a bastard and a killer; cold-blooded killer, as a matter of fact. A story of poverty and isolation in 19th century Russia. It is a classic. Very fulfilling. There are no flaws in this book."
"856",855,"Corrie","Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov is a young man with dreams of being great with a capital G however he is living in poverty and cannot be comforted by little things such as being young, handsome, intelligent, healthy and having friends and family who would do anything for him. His inconsolable ego drives the story about apathetic and disaffected youth written well over a hundred years ago that remains disturbingly relevant. The story clips along quickly and it is not a difficult read but you cannot skim. Every line is significant, no characters are superfluous, and the Russian names are not easy to keep straight. Print a list off the internet to help you remember Avdotya is the formal name of Dounia, etc. Rather than attempt to summarize the story I will include two passages that do all that work for me. Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov is summed up nicely as he observes a young woman who has become a prositute to support her alcoholic father.*""There are three ways before her,"" he thought,""the canal, the madhouse, or... at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns the heart to stone.""The last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, he was young, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could not help believing that the last end was the most likely.*The novel itself is also nicely summarized by the author.*This is a fantastic gloomy business, a modern case, an incident of to-day when the heart of man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood 'renews', when comfort is preached as the aim of life. Here we have bookish dreams, a heart unhinged by theories. Here we see resolution in the first stage, but resoulution of a special kind: he resolved to do it like jumping off a precipice or from a bell-tower and his legs shook as he went to the crime. He forgot to shut the door after him, and murdered two people for a theory... he is a murderer, but looks upon himself as an honest man, despises others, poses as injured innocence.*I can't recomend it highly enough. It's beautifully written, challenging and inspiring. Patrick Bateman has nothing on our Russian psycho, Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov. "
"857",856,"Chezna","Can be hard to get through, but you'll think about it a lot and remember it forever. I am always looking for a way to relate this book to the modern literature my book club reads - so many current books have tragic and depressing themes, and they just weigh me down and bum me out and I am definitely turned off - with this book, many of the same depressing things occur, but I can accept and understand why Dostoevsky included them, and appreciate how I am asked by the author to reflect on humanity and responsibility, as opposed to just being told to cry and be sad, which is what a lot of more modern (Oprah picks) books seem to want."
"858",857,"Teresa","Oh, Rodya, thou art no Napoleon... and a good thing that is, or this would be a much less arresting read. After reading it some time right after high school, and loving it, I decided it was time to revisit this tome and I'm very happy I did. I enjoyed it even more this second time!This is not just a psychologically fascinating tale, it's a masterful dance! Just look at the dialogues, it's a near constant to and fro, together and apart, round and round the dancefloor! It's frustratingly captivating, it makes you ache as the characters ache, it creates a fervor, almost a madness, and when it gives you sweet relief it is not without a price that must be paid. That's life, that's Dostoyevsky, and this is masterful storytelling.The biggest difference between reading it before and reading it now I think is that I found a new, strange, not necessarily love for - but certainly appreciation of - the Svidrigailov character. Raskolnikov's and his conversation at the start of part 4 is simply wonderful to read and while he isn't to be loved or adored, he does bring a certain delight to every page he is in. This book is nothing but a masterpiece, as the world already knows. It tackles difficult topics with flare and presents it in a uniqely Dostoyevskian way. I could go on but what's the point? Anyone who hasn't read it should! "
"859",858,"Naomi Miller","I really enjoy all of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's books and this is no exception. It was a bit different than some of his other works and I can see why it became a classic. I could not put it down."
"860",859,"Alejandro","Llegué a Dostoyevski, en parte, por las referencias que suele hacer Henry Miller en sus libros a propósito suyo. Decidí empezar por una de las novelas más conocidas del escritor Ruso.Entre tantas cosas que podría opinar de este libro, hay dos cosas importantes : los contrastes que generan en mí las descripciones y el nivel de realidad. Cuando menciono el nivel de realidad no me refiero el género del realismo en la literatura, necesariamente, sino a las descripciones de pensamientos y sentimientos de los personajes. Son pensamientos y sentimientos reales, cosas que a cualquiera podría ocurrir. En cuanto a los contrastes, es un tema mas bien subjetivo y personal : es el hecho de comparar San Petersburgo, una ciudad que siempre he querido visitar, que en google imágenes se ve majestuosa, con la San Petersburgo de la historia, llena de miseria.Uno de los momentos mas intensos de esta novela es cuando (view spoiler)[ el protagonista sufre un estado parecido a la enfermedad, justo después del asesinato. La mente de Raskolnikov trata de suprimir, inútilmente, el acto que acaba de realizar a través de un debilitamiento físico y adormecimiento. Esta parte fue tan fuerte que llegué a imaginarme que de alguna manera yo habría asesinado a alguien también, pero que a través de sueños y agotamientos auto-inducidos lo habría olvidado.  (hide spoiler)]La historia tiene un sin número de personajes que están, o caen, en la desgracia. Y a pesar de ello Dostoyevski presenta algunas escenas de humor negro, cómo cuando una señora pretende celebrar un funeral con las personas mas distinguidas posibles ( en la mentalidad de la señora ) y se le aparecen personas con bata de dormir o que solo quieren comer algo...El personaje del detective es muy bueno.(view spoiler)[ Es uno de los detectives más estresantes que he visto, ya que nunca abandona su presa sin dejar mostrar cierta serenidad. El detective opina sobre el estado del criminal, encerrado en si mismo y sin escapatoria, con un discurso tan claro y real que acaba reduciendo a Raskolnikov a su condena inevitable. (hide spoiler)]Desde un punto de vista moral y educativo, pienso que la novela tiene un gran valor. Vivimos en sociedades que han banalizado la criminalidad y que se hunden progresivamente en la impunidad ( tal vez a Dostoyevski le tocó vivir una época similar ). (view spoiler)[ El crimen se presenta como un terreno desconocido e inescrutable. Los cambios que sufre la persona son irreparables. Es como una especie de demostración de la imposibilidad de llevar el crimen y una mente normal por el mismo camino. (hide spoiler)]No soy un fan de las novelas llenas de desgracias, sin embargo recomiendo, sinceramente, esta novela. "
"861",860,"Haley Mathiot","**spoilers**Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky. read by Anthony Heald.Genre: Fiction, classicRating: 5Sin, Sentence, and SalvationThe allegory of Crime and PunishmentCrime and Punishment, one of the more famous works of Fyodor Dostoevsky, is considered “the first great novel of his mature period,” (Frank, 1995) and is one of his more famous books, rivaled only by The Brothers Karamazov. What makes Crime and Punishment such a classic? Perhaps because it is a picture of the only classic, and greatest story of all time. Crime and Punishment is an allegory of Salvation.Self-justifiedThe main character, Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, was a poor student at a university, and was overcome with hate toward an old pawnbroker, and decided to rid the world of her for the greater good of everyone. He believed that she was a “louse,” and since everyone would be happier without her, his actions would be justified. He believed that he had broken the letter of the law only, but that it didn’t have any authority over him anyway because it was written by people just as low as himself. He didn’t believe in God, and in prison he was convinced that he didn’t deserve his treatment, and that it was something he simply needed to get over with. He had no higher authority, so he said “my conscience is at rest.” This is a picture of man before he is touched by the merciful salvation of Christ.A Troubled ManAlthough Raskolnikov justified his actions in killing the old woman, he still felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and fear over what he did. He worked very hard at keeping it a secret, and at first he thought he could live with the guilt that sat in back of his mind, but he was wrong. Raskolnikov had horrible dreams, was always sick, and one of the other characters noticed that he was constantly “set off by little things” for no apparent reason (though the reader knew that it was only because it reminded him of his crime). This represents a man who knows in his heart that he is a sinner, but who will not turn and repent from his sin.Unending LoveSonya Semyonovna Marmeladov was the daughter of a drunkard who “took the yellow card” and prostituted herself to support her family. Throughout the book, Sonya began to love Raskolnikov. Eventually, Raskolnikov told Sonya his secret. Sonya was horrified, but still loved him and forgave him after her initial shock wore off. As Raskolnikov was fighting inside with his conscience and his sins, he repeatedly snapped at her, refused her comfort, yelled at her, and so on. He was a bitter, angry, hateful man—and yet Sonya forgave him for everything he did to her, and everything he had done in his past. What redeeming quality Sonya saw in the wretch and why she forgave him, one cannot begin to comprehend; aside from the simple truth that Sonya was a loving, gentile, merciful girl. She saw that Raskolnikov needed someone to love him and she reached out to him, even when he repeatedly pushed her away. Sonya’s love for him is a picture of Christ’s unending and perfect love to His sinful people.A Silent WitnessWhen Raskolnikov finally broke down and confessed his crime, Sonya moved to Siberia with him. Raskolnikov expected this, and knew that telling her not to come would be fruitless. She visited him often in prison and wrote to his family for him. But although Raskolnikov expected her to preach to him and push the Gospel in his face, she did not. Sonya followed the scripture’s instruction to Christian wives with non-Christian husbands in 1 Peter 3:1—“ Wives, in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives…” The verse tells women to be good examples of Christ to their non-Christian husbands rather than to preach to them and try to convert them, and that is exactly what Sonya did, even though she was not married to him. She did not try to convert him with words; rather she won him with her love. She did not push the Testament into Raskolnikov’s hands, he asked for it. When she did bring it, she did not pester him to read it. She had faith, and showed Raskolnikov the love of Christ through her actions. In the end, it paid off. Although Dostoevsky does not specifically say that Raskolnikov was converted, he does imply that he eventually became a Christian when he mused “Can not her own convictions now be mine?”The truth will set you freeWhen Raskolnikov finally realized that he loved Sonya, he accepted that he was a criminal, and a murderer. When he finally accepted that he was a sinner, he repented and had a new life in him. He said he felt like “he had risen again” and that Sonya “lived only in his life.” By life, Dostoevsky refers to his mentality. Before, he had been a living dead man in prison. He was hated by his inmates, was almost killed by them in an outbreak, was unaffected by anything that happened to him or his family, and eventually became ill from it all. But after his resurrection, he repented from his sins, learned to move on with his life, and started to change. He began to converse with his inmates, and they no longer hated him. Sonya was alive in his “life” because of her love for him. When he was changed, she was so happy that she became sick with joy, to the point that she was ill in bed. Dostoevsky paints a picture of a redeemed man at the end of his novel—redeemed both by the law, and by God. This picture symbolizes the miracle of salvation through Christ.An amazing AllegoryDostoevsky was a wonderful writer because of his use of dialogue to tell the story, his descriptive scenes, his powerfully developed characters, and their inner dialogue. He often times told you that something was happening by only telling you what the character who was speaking at the time said in response to what was going on. For example, if Sonya was standing up, Dostoevsky would write “… ‘hey, what do you stand for?’ for Sonya had stood.”He also painted such good descriptions of his characters, that by the middle of the book he didn’t have to say that Raskolnikov was musing in the corner of the room, glaring at anyone who was brave enough to look at him, while he stewed in grief under his old ratted cap, because you knew from how well he was described earlier and how well his character was developed from the dialogue, that he was doing exactly that.His characters are so real, they almost frighten you because you see the things they do and feel and experience reflected in your own life. They are not perfect—in fact they are all incredibly flawed, but they are a joy to read.His ending is superb, because he closes the story without actually telling you everything. He never says that Raskolnikov was converted, he never says when he got out of prison, and he never says that Sonya and he were married, but you know that it happened. The last scene of the story is so superb, it makes you want to read it again, just to experience the joy all over again.But what really made Crime and Punishment the classic that it was is the picture of the best story in the world, the classic story of the world, showing through. The story of the Gospel, of Jesus Christ’s unending love and sin and salvation is clearly portrayed, and makes a joyous read.Works cited:Quotes are from Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky, 1886Frank, Joseph (1995).

I bought (ouch) the audio book of Crime and Punishment, recorded by Anthony Heald who did a fantastic job reading. His voices for the characters perfectly matched them, he felt for them, and he acted them. None of them were cheesy (yeah you all know how lame some male readers are at acting female voices). He read fast enough that the story didn't drag at all, but not so fast that you'd feel like you'd miss something if you didn't listen hard. I will definitely re-listen to the audio book.Content: some gruesome descriptions of blood from the murderRecommendation: Ages 14+"
"862",861,"buzzkarla","Okay fine, this book is lengthy, like very. But every page that it has more than an average number in a book does not mean that it's any less great because I got hands down for this book. It's so packed with values and ideas, some of which I concur and some I oppose. But surely if you read this book you'll not regret the times where you opted to sit alone with it. You'll learn something, and that something I might have no idea about for you but I know what it is for me."
"863",862,"Preeti Arunapuram","Wow... where do I begin?The story moves at a relatively quick pace from the very beginning of the book and the language, to me, seemed very simple. So for those of you that complain that the beginnings of books are slow and boring, here's on that you'll delight in reading.I feel that Dostoevsky really captures his characters really well. He develops all sorts of personalities in this book, namely Raskolnikov, who is a troubled man with blaringly conflicting emotions. Basically, he struggles to establish a good name for himself in society after he commits the terrible crime of murder, yet he embraces his apparently superior position over all others in the world. While Raskolnikov is a highly complex character, Dostoevsky creates other, simpler characters. However, they still adorn the main plotline with equally compelling sidestories (such as that of Dunya). I honestly loved all the female characters in this story save a few like the pawnbroker. Those I'm talking about are Dunya (Raskolnikov's siser), Raskolnikov's mother, and Sonya. In a story where a male protagonist undergoes massive emotional turmoil, Dostoevsky projects a strong female presence. Dunya comes across as a self-respecting, yet down-to-earth sister who aids Raskolnikov in any way possible. Raskolnikov's mother does not do as much as Dunya, but her persistence to do good for her children is felt throughout the novel. Sonya herself was very interesting. Although she is portrayed as a cowering, overly delicate figure in Raskolnikov's presence, her dedication to him and to his ultimate confession is imperative to the plotline. I don't consider myself (or Dostoevsky) necessarily a feminist, but I warmed to his portrayal of women in a time when that was not so. The plot is engaging and thrilling. I found it interesting that the reader got exclusive insight into the mind of a criminal. We know what the crime is, who committed it, and all the little details. For once, we do not really know what the police or the detectives are thinking. It is the norm for the reader to experience the crime from the outside, but never from the perspective of the emotional tortured criminal who is undergoing a massive change in character and perspective. As a lover of mysteries, I found this plot quite special. Crime and Punishment, as I mentioned before, is relatively simple in terms of language. Of course, that depends on which translation you read. I recommend reading Constance Garnett's version. This book delves into the mind of a man who has committed a crime and lives with guilt and fear. The characters were quite fun to read about and imagine and the story itself is very engaging. I strongly recommend reading this book."
"864",863,"Andrew Wright","This is one of the best psychological novels ever. I love that the ""Crime"" happens in the first 50 pages, and the ""Punishment"" is mostly internal, mostly moral. When I read this at the age of 17 or 18, I was first falling in love with a small quiet and devoutly pious Christian girl. She wasn't a prostitute, and I wasn't out killing pawn brokers, but I still found a bit of myself in Raskolnikov and a bit of her in Sonia. Now that I'm older, I feel a lot more like Svidrigailov, who is certainly my favorite character. When an ex-girlfriend read this and I gave it a reread with her, I was much more impressed with how the book is a blatant reaction to popular idealogies. It's kind of sweepingly reactionary, and I'm okay with that, because I can be too. Traditional morals exist for a reason. They have the tried and true tests of time and experience. We know that rules and morals and laws keep society together, but this book also points out that they keep individuals together, which in turn implies the obvious, that individuals comprise society."
"865",864,"Clint","There is nothing new to be said about Crime and Punishment that has not already been said. Until now, my favorite novel of any I have read was The Brothers Karamazov, but Crime and Punishment will now sit just to the left of it on my bookshelf. Thought the anti-semitism is difficult to digest at times throughout the novel, and should not be brushed aside lightly, I'm sure many have written about it already much more thoroughly than I am able here. Regardless of its modern flaws, It is a beautiful novel of mental suffering, despair, hope, love, and redemption. Dostoevsky is a master of characters and dialogue. It's definitely worth a read. "

"867",866,"Tori","What would you do if you killed someone? What happens if it was for the good of the world? Raskolnikov, the main character, will tell you that you did a good deed. Fyodor Dostoyevsky effortlessly encompasses the meaning of a mental breakdown, he takes you into the mind of a murderer and makes you sympathetic for them. Trying keeping your morals on point when you read this book. Raskolnikov believes he can easily hide from the truths, but once the truth begins to eat at him, well we all know what happens then. This book is perfect for anyone interested in the human emotions and wants to be challenged."

"869",868,"Toru","Wow. What a ride! I got up from my bed, went to the bathroom, reminded myself of the sheer historic momentousness of this tome, forced myself to plod through the last ten or so pages (excluding epilogue) despite it being the second night in a row that i was up even at 3am, trying to finish homework for all kinds of classes... and bam, i come out with a 5-star impression of the book. When i was done, i turned off the lights and lay in bed, reflecting on the entire course of the story until i slumber soon took over my consciousness. I saved the epilogue for the day after...I'm not sure what exactly i gained from reading Crime & Punishment, but i feel an intangible certainty that i was able to come out of it with a little more... how should i say - wisdom - then i possessed before. The memories are still too fresh for me to right a coherent and meaningful review, the novel is still too personal for me...But they say that every law student reads this master-piece of fiction at some point during their education, and as a work of literature it has consistently stood the test of time and of all cultural boundaries. I really think anyone who is even remotely interested in Crime and/or Punishment, should read the entire book. (I read Crime during my 12-credit-load 2nd-quarter of freshman year in my tough Russian Studies program, and finished Punishment (finally) during my 20-credit (completely full-load) 3rd quarter, for another for another class.) You will thank yourself for having done so."
"870",869,"Alexander Seifert","Never has a book caused such an adverse effect on my psyche as Crime and Punishment. The main character (I won't attempt to spell his name) and his descent into torment at his actions and the paranoia he feels is enough to unnerve even the strongest willed individual. The protagonist's attempts to rationalize his actions and assure himself that he was in the right are probably situations that anyone has been in (albeit hopefully with less murderous intentions). Unlike many Russian works, I didn't feel like the book dragged or that I struggled to reach the end. Of the end, I wasn't very moved, as it just seemed like an ad for Christianity, but I do like that the character managed to find redemption through penance and the someone's love. I imagine if this was published in a more contemporary age, the main character would just walk away and continue being a morally ambiguous a-hole or something worse, but hey, this was a more romantic age (ironic since we're talking mid-19th century Russia <_<)"

"873",872,"Shaun","With 8,000+ reviews, there's really not much chance anyone will stumble across this review hoping for a detailed analysis. Instead, I'm just going to rave a bit about Dostoevsky. I really am no longer sure why bother reading anyone else in between his books. I've taken to rationing them out to myself. I read five or six other works before picking up another of his, yet every time I come back, I find everything I find those novels to be lacking.I adore his hysterically philosophical characters, how they pour out their own intellectual and spiritual struggles and hypotheses to each other in enthusiastic torrents. I find in his characters a sense of intellectual camaraderie and mutual worth that are rare in modern, or maybe just real-life relationships. I find myself wanting to be even half as open and honest as even his most villainous inventions. And the things they are saying aren't just for the sake of furthering his intriguingly complex plots, but serve a dual-purpose of revealing, if not a philosophical truth, at least the potential path to one (or away from one, depending on the mindset of the character delivering it). His writing is consummately satisfying."
"874",873,"Di","Re-reading this book has made me realize that, a lot of books, such as this one, communicate better when being read throughout a extended period of time, with several breaks and other not-quite-serious/tense things in between.

"879",878,"mohamed mostafa","in Crime and Punishment everybody in this novel has a story everybody has different character and different suffering but if we want to speak about everybody we will need to write another book.but we will talk about basic characters.Dostoevsky turns on the paradoxical character of a thoughtful, sensitive young man Though he seems a brutal murderer, he’s a philosophic young man who radically challenges our basic assumptions about good and evil.Dostoevsky conceived his novel as answer to the philosophic theories of his day ""utilitarianism & nihilism"".In light of these theories, Dostoevsky’s novel asks, in effect, “How would a humanitarian murderer conceive his crime, commit it, then live with the consequences?” :1- Raskolnikov a young man who embraced dangerous new theories. Raskolnikov publishes an article arguing that ordinary people admit to law but extraordinary people ,such as Napoleon, have the right to break the law and kill people even innocent people for the benefit of humanity in large.2- While drinking tea at a tavern, he overhears a student whose comments on a rich old pawnbroker. The student says the woman—who has left all her money to a monastery—should be killed and her money devoted to the service of all mankind. Raskolinkof start thinking of that and ask himself wouldn't thousands of good deeds make up for one little tiny crime?..... and what does the life of this stupid, consumptive, wicked and old crone mean in the general balance? no more than a life of a louse. he aimes to use the woman’s money to relieve his widowed mother and sister from the burden of supporting him.Raskolnikov wrestles with himself. he’s repelled by the thought of it. He begs God to deliver him from the nightmare of his own intentions.but his urge to renounce his intentions can not stand the pressure of what he takes to be fate. when he goes to the market he overhears Lizaveta,the sister of old woman, talking to wife and agree to see them at 7 o'clock the following night. he nearby acquires a captivating piece of information that tomorrow at 7 o'clock in the evening Lizaveta will be out and the old woman will be left at home ALONE. a sense of destiny now seizes Raskolnikov and feels that he is predistened to do so.3- After killing the old woman, he must also kill her innocent sister, Lizaveta, because she sees the corpse.4- He stashes the old woman’s loot in a small hole in a deserted lot. then he realizes that he doesn’t even know how much money is in the woman’s purse that he stole or what he would do with it. he finds that this crime hasn't made him Napoleon and he is also consumptive and nothing as the old woman.5- He becomes isolated. When his mother and sister come from the country to see him,he realizes that he can’t talk to them at all and feels he does not want to talk to anyone about anything ever.paradoxically, he speaks too much to the man he should hide as much as possible ,the police inspector (Porfiry). by questioning Raskolnikov about his article, he is like krombo, asls questions which seems trivia but lead him to know what he wants to know and the police inspector nearly gets him to admit his guilt:a- When Porfiry asks Raskolnikov if he considers himself one of the “extraordinary”people who have the right to break laws, Raskolnikov says it’s possible.b- When Porfiry asks Raskolnikov if he himself would kill and rob, Raskolnikov says only that he would not tell Porfiry if he did.6- Exemplifying the psychology of guilt as Dostoevsky conceives it, Raskolnikov’s conscience demands that he be punished for his crime. 7- kindness and sensitivity of Raskolinkov will save him from his suffering.early in the novel, Dostoevsky shows the kind side of Raskolinkov, He tries to save the drunken young girl that he sees on a bench from a rich man wants to use her.this sensitivity will lead him to give most of his money to Marmeladov's destitute family. His generosity to the Marmeladov family wins the love of Sonia, Marmeladov’s daughter, who has been supporting the family with her earnings as a harlot, but who sets out to keep Raskolnikov spiritually, physically, and emotionally alive.8- Raskolnikov's sister, Dounia, tells him that she will marry to a rich man, but he knows that she hates him.He can not bear that donia will sacrifice herself for the seek of his own advancements. in eyes of Raskolinkof Donia and Sonia have to choose between prostitution and destitution unless he finds a third alternative for them, which he does. he also come to cherished Sonia as the only one who can save him from madness and suicidal despair. he needs her as she needs him 9- Sonia finally offers the despairing Raskolnikov the gift of faith. She gives him a copy of the New Testament brought to her by the murdered Lizaveta.Raskolinkof confesses to Sonia that he killed both the old and Lizaveta. at the moment of confession, he sees Sonia's face the face of Lizaveta, the same look of helpless childish terror. but sonia does not reject him. she tells him that she will never leave him and indeed she does.a harlot and a murderer are Reading together the story of Christ and he agrees to admit his crime to police.10- Raskolinkov goes to prison and Sonia follows him to prison in Siberia.in the prison he asks himself why he should go on living? why he does not kill him self? Sonia give him the answer, In the light of her devotion, he sees “the dawn of a renewed future.” they were resurrected by love, the heart of each held infinite sources of live for the heart of the other.crime and punishment is a story of a crime , suffering and the mind of murderer and also a story of regeneration and Dostovesky's faith in the love, faith and human soul."
"880",879,"Dana Farmer","I loved this book! I was very surprised by the ending and I love it when that happens! It was extremely well written and I loved how it flowed. I thought for a while I might get annoyed with the way Rodya was handling certain things, but then things would change and another surprise would unfold. I did not quite fall in love with the book until midway through. Then, it was almost impossible to put down (except that I had to put it down several times which is why it took so long for me to read it! Ugh! I don't know how I picked audiobook for the type, but it was actually a book). Anyway, it was great and I will be looking into his other books to see if there is something of interest still waiting for me! "
"881",880,"Candice","One of my top 10 books. There's just so much here. Friendship, psychology, the treatment of women in the 19th century, what it means to be evil, what it means to be a little evil, how reactions can't be predicted, especially when they're our own reactions. Most of all, it's that punishment comes long before the criminal is found out, maybe even before the crime. "
"882",881,"Rebecca F.","An incredible portrait of insanity. Having known some manic, bi-polar, eccentric, paranoid people in my life, it was almost shocking to see the initmate reality of such conditions revealed so openly on the page. As there are likely whole graduate-level courses devoted to the genius of Dostoevsky, the amateur reader in me won't dare to offer much critique other than to say that this book was thoroughly exiting to read. So visceral, you can almost feel your own heart racing along with the main character's escalations into madness."

"885",884,"Klbennett14","One of the best books I have ever read. While reading it I kept believing it was about how we as humans can justify anything, and put ourselves on a pedestal. In the end it is a story about the process of repentance."
"886",885,"Allison","Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is epic in the scope of human emotions, yet fiercely small in execution; it centers around a few ordinary people and takes place in the span of only a few weeks. It focuses on the deeds and subsequent demons of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov – a young intellectual who murders an old woman in an attempt to make himself ""extraordinary."" As the novel progresses, Raskolnikov must face his own guilt, disappointment, and ultimate transformation. Dostoevsky's intention, namely, to question what happens when the intellect is one's only guide, is captured very clearly in his writing. This book provides a thrilling and captivating plot while still managing to impart the wisdom that will so often drag a book like this down. As the Chicago Tribune says, this translation retains the ""force and frightening immediacy"" that comes across in the original Russian. This novel is not only a page turner, but a stunning insight into the complications of the human mind. It will draw you deeply into the earthy Russian spirit, seizing your interest and making you rethink your own values and the morals of our society. "
"887",886,"Kirstie","This book surprised me...some may look down on me for not reading any Dostoevsky novels until I was 30 but honestly I thought it might be a bit over my head. I found this to be as easy as reading someone like Hemingway, though, only with more of a Dickens meets Hesse in Russia sort of feel to it. In any case, it was very easy to understand with the exception of the names of the characters at times.Crime and Punishment is one of those books you feel is incredibly relevant and probably will be so as long as there are humans existing on the planet. Dostoevsky's insight on humanity, consequences, and even social structures are advanced and quite profound. The moral arguments within this text are fascinating to read in the same way many of the best philosophy texts are, only this is applied to a situation one must imagine has occurred hundreds of times both before and after the novel is written. I don't think Dostoevsky's goal was to stop people from committing crimes but delve deep within the psyche of one murderer and show us the mirror he brought with him on the dive."
"888",887,"Nika Caraman","This is definitely in my top 10 of books I have ever read. Dostoyevski has the tendency to be dull, until you get into the story. I love the way he develops the characters, giving them shape and depth. I am sorry I finished reading it, although I have been trying to read it by bits, so that I can enjoy it longer. Will definitely read it again, in a few years time. And am not giving up on the hardcopy, as it is one that I'd like to hold on to. "
"889",888,"Sairah","For such a long book it had something to say throughout. Something profound and something not altogether easily categorised. I'm conflicted, not sure if I absolutely love it (reading a translation of course cant be as good as the original). A book which was ahead of its time a psychological thriller with elements of alienation, morality, pride and ego, radical thinking and much more. ""It began with the socialist doctrine. You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing more; no other causes admitted!"""
"890",889,"Preston Bernstein","This novel stayed with me for weeks. I often think of it even now. It is a great caution against putting your nose where it doesn't belong. "
"891",890,"Tommy","It is no mystery to me after re-reading (or reading thoroughly for the first time actually) this classic. Raskolnikov is truly a ground breaking character in literature. Dostoyevsky takes you inside the mind of a 'regular' man who commits murder and instead of playing him as merely a villain, takes you inside his head and makes you understand how his mind works and his inner turmoil and insecurity.Truly a monumental work and a psychological masterpiece from, in my opinion, Russia's greatest author.A must read for everyone."
"892",891,"D.","My first Dostoevsky. Gives an insightful look into a tormented soul. I could relate to the main character so well it was almost scary. It was also a surprisingly accessible read, maybe it was the translation (Pevear and Volokhonsky (sp?)) I read...Anyway, I feel further comments aren't necessary for this particular book: everybody should read this."
"893",892,"Nick Smith","I first read ""Crime and Punishment"" at the age of eighteen, and the weighty issues involving murderous rage, suicide, and the like were a bit too much. But now I have re-read the book, and noticed so much more of its grandeur, its significant importance in the canon of Western Literature. It deserves the highest praise, as both a representative story of suffering and redemption, and as a ""thinker's book"" exploring deep philosophical issues relating to Friedrich Nietzsche and theories of ""The extraordinary man"" and ""The Superman."" These are woven into a story which is also a psychological exploration of a man searching for his place, denying himself, suffering as a result, and ultimately finding love. At one point, the criminal Raskolnikov exclaims in passionate frenzy:""...so, why are you embracing me? Because I couldn't endure it myself, and have come to shift the burden onto another: 'You suffer too, it will be so much the easier for me!' Can you really love such a scoundrel?""Not only does Sonya love Raskolnikov, despite his crimes, but she also becomes the symbol of suffering humanity, suggesting to him that he prostrate himself before God and man, claim his wicked deed, expiate his own sin, and redeem himself to his proper place. In the beginning, Raskolnikov believes himself to be more important, the ""Extraordinary Man"" theory, which holds that a man of greatness, such as Napoleon, can step over others and kill them, because of his own superiority.Coupled with this is the character of Svidrigailov, who represents Nietzsche's ""Superman,"" and ultimately thinks he can do however he pleases. This theory in opposition to Raskolnikov's, would mean that Svidrigailov can be on his own, alone, needing no one. In the end, it is disproved, because the man who wanted to do as he pleases and be independent of other people, desires the warmth and affection (and human contact) of a young girl. This failure of his theory leads him to contemplate his existence, see no way forward, and kill himself with a bullet through the brain.The extraordinary one here is Fyodor Dostoevsky, who is able to represent a raving madman, going into great detail of his interior monologue, of his illness. This state of mind is so well-written, that I believe it to rank with Edgar Allan Poe's story ""The Tell-Tale Heart,"" in that it describes a man who is driven mad by the murder he has already fully committed himself to perform. It is this description of the mental state, and the wonderfully well-written story, underlaid with such rich philosophical theories and psychological background, that makes me give this novel five stars. I am sure that I will one day seek it out on my bookshelves again. I decided to read this new translation, expertly done by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. It was expertly done, mentioning ""a sucker"" (i.e. a ""fool""), someone being ""plastered"" (i.e. ""drunk""), just to include two examples. This vernacular of common everyday people, this richly translated story, including all of the wonderfully explained footnotes, lend new life to it, and far surpass any previous translation. I know, because I read one myself at the age of 18."
"894",893,"Mike Goodson","Disturbing, horrifying, uncomfortable, beautiful, rewarding and thoughtful. Push through and you'll see its fingerprints on your life."
"895",894,"Frankie","The remarkable thing about Dostoevsky's characters is his foresight in portraying their reactions to their fate. He somehow always knows how a certain personality will end up, how he'll be forced to come to terms with his ideal. In Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov may appear to be mad, but his fantasy is almost reasonable in light of his suffering, which comes to the fore gradually throughout the plot. Though he's an inwardly charitable and (compared to other loathsome characters, like Luzhin and Svidrigailov) even compassionate gentleman, his crime is clearly vile and egoistic. We're reminded constantly throughout the plot that this crime is clearly wrong, that this man has done wrong and for the wrong reasons.Dostoevsky has every confidence that his readers are intelligent enough to know that he doesn't condone murder. In fact, Raskolnikov's path of delirium causes more anguish for himself and those around him than any punishment in Siberia. Nothing is resolved concerning his Napoleonic ideal, he only concludes himself unworthy of it – this is my only issue with the text. If anything is redeemed in the course of events, it's always the inevitability of poverty and death that resolves the situation. The drunkeness of Marmelodov, the madness of Katerina Ivanovna, the dangerous stalking of Svidrigailov – these intrigues are all relieved by untimely deaths.The only characters that seem to be fantastic are ironically the only comforting and recognizably fabled in the cast - Lebezyatnikov and Luzhin. In the funeral feast scene, Luzhin is called out and humiliated by his ""partner in crime"" Lebezyatnikov for framing Sonya. It's cathartic but seems awkwardly placed or rushed in. Aside from this the plot and characters are genius, of course, and still so perfectly dark and ominous scene by scene, that I feel absurd critiquing it at all.I regret that I hadn't read this properly and in-depth before, and after reading this PV translation I think of it as nearly as good as The Idiot and The Brothers Karamozov. If you're having a difficult time with it, watch the 1970 USSR adaptation (of like title) by Lev Kulidzhanov. It's accurate and the English dubbing can easily be set."
"896",895,"Rick Slane","I read this book in the 1970's. No book has probably had a greater influence on my reading or even life. I'm told that Dostoyevsky is somewhat out of favor today and that's a shame. This book is at the top of my reread list. I recently saw the movie with Peter Lorie in the lead role. This is a GREAT read!"
"897",896,"Chey","I have many favorite books, but this one just might top the list. I read it in highschool, but it really impacted me. It's about crime...and punishment...(ha ha) but also about self-hatred, love, and redemption. "
"898",897,"Koroviev","I have tried to write a review for this book several times, but have failed. What follows is not much of a review but ""notes"" for  my own-self, much like Rodya's murders. :-) I read this book like a thriller - I was so curious about Rodya's fate that I read the 700+ pages in about five days, which makes this book the fastest I've ever read. Needless to say, this also means that I was so highly engaged in the plot that I could not pay attention to much else. This makes me want to re-read the book sometime in the future, when I am hopefully more aware of the Russian socio-political scene around that time. *Purpose of the book: Initially I thought of it more like a psychological exercise - to understand the mind of a murderer. But as the novel progressed, it felt more like an attempt to portray the murderer as a human - very soon I liked Raskolnikov even after the murders. His impulsive urge to help people in need (often at a cost to his own self), his love for his mother and sister and general goodness made him very likeable (except when he was angry and even when he thought himself mighty special). Post-murders, I felt all his emotions - his fear and anxiety, then his hopefulness and relief, and then fear and anxiety again and so on. The only thing which threw me off now and then was his sudden and intense loathing towards other people, which because I could not feel, amused me. *In the (very interesting) afterword to this edition (ISBN 190463334X (ISBN13: 9781904633341)), Oliver Francis mentions that in writing this book, Dostoevsky was warning against the effects of Nihilism. Rodya is a quintessential Nihilist and in Dostoevsky's opinion, Nihilists are upto no good. He says that it is only in God we find the meaning of life, and we must suffer to find happiness (apparently a Russian Orthodox belief). In retrospect, this seems to be the case as most of the book is about Rodya's suffering and then redemption with the help of Sonia (who he initially dismisses as a ""holy-fool""), although I almost completely missed this point. The time when Rodya asked Sonia to read to him the section on Lazarus from the Bible, should have served as a hint, but I still failed to pay attention. On the other hand, I read it much like a commentary on power. Raskolnikov is not wrong, when he claims that there exist men who are special and that most (or did he say all?) ""great men"" are criminals in a way. The examples he gives of ""great men"" were actually ""powerful men"" rather than say poets. With great power, comes a license to do whatever the hell you want, and the only reason Rodya 'failed' was that he was poor. Even then, being a member of the Elite (because of his education), he was somewhat spared by Porfiry because Porfiry claimed to like him and to find him interesting. Would he have done the same if Rodya was an uneducated non-elite? *Dreams as a way of knowing the characters more deeply. Again something I noticed by did not realize. A lot of the characters' dreams are described in good detail. *There was an interesting comment on the naming of characters: Sonia's intimate name ""Sofia"" derives from he Greek for wisdom, whilst Raskolnikov's sensible, industrious, generous friend Razumihin derives from Russian razum meaning reason or good sense. The falsely confessing Nikolay Dementyev gain his name as a derivation from the Latin dementia (madness), and Dounia's unscrupulous and mercenary fiance Luzhin stems from lyzhin meaning dirty or muddy. The name of Raskolnikov himself is derived from raskol meaning schism or break."

A diverse cast of well developed characters shows how different people may view and handle these intricate concepts. Still, fairly easy to get into and not at all the tiring read one might expect."

"912",911,"Nilay Özsüer","Russian literature has always been one of my favorites, although I'm a student of English literature, and Dostoyevsky is without doubt, the main reason for this interest. Whenever I see Crime and Punishment on my shelf, I feel like picking it up from it's place and start reading it all over again! The novel is surely a masterpiece! I will never get bored of reading it! It is usually my first recommendation whenever I'm asked to give one."
"913",912,"Steven Tiberius","I read this in high school in lieu of The Great Gatsby - along with about two other people in my class - because it was longer and neglected by most of my so-called A.P.

You hear me???"
"914",913,"Israel  Toledo","Una excelente edición de este clásico ruso. Fedor Dostoievsky nos arrastra por las profundidades de la mente humana. Esta novela trasciende el tiempo porque su temática es la contradicción de la mente misma, ¿Quién puede afirmar que comparte todos los valores de la sociedad? ¿Quién no ha pensado en cometer lo que para otros es un crimen, pero para él no es más que un medio para un fin? El castigo autoimpuesto por la conciencia quiza sea el mejor invento de la sociedad moderna. No es realmente el castigo físico el que destruye un alma, sino el que la mente del criminal le dicta. Con personajes completamente logrados, Dostoievsky nos narra una de las historias más trascendentes del siglo XIX. Definitivamente es una novela para leerse. Aunque siendo honestos, no es para todos. Lectores noveles, abstengansé, les aburrirá."

"919",918,"Mari Biella","Well, what can I say that hasn’t been said a thousand times before? Sitting here typing this review reminds me why I rarely bother writing reviews of established classics. It’s all been said before, so often and so well; what can a numpty like me hope to add?I first read Crime and Punishment when I was a teenager. I loved it, but at the same time I don’t think I fully understood it. I was too innocent, perhaps, and too desperate to believe that people are basically good, and that we should all, y’know, be nice to each other. A few years and a few bruises later, that belief is difficult to sustain. And Crime and Punishment takes us right down into the dark, seething, ugly heart of humanity – and then, hauntingly, shines a faint ray of hope into it.On the surface, the plot is simple enough; but Dostoyevsky never operates solely (or even primarily) on a surface level, which is perhaps one of the reasons why I love him. Beneath the apparent simplicity of the story is a web of interlocking philosophical, moral, religious, political and social questions. For example, Raskolnikov’s crime is informed by his idea that certain men, in certain conditions, have the right to sidestep, or discard, morality. Interestingly, Crime and Punishment was one of Moors Murderer Ian Brady’s favourite books, and he identified strongly with Raskolnikov; but he also discarded Dostoyevsky’s central message about repentance and redemption.We experience Raskolnikov’s descent as he does, from the dramatic opening chapter in which he contemplates murder, through his agony and tortuous attempts to justify himself, right through to his punishment (and the start of his eventual redemption). Several scenes are frighteningly real: Raskolnikov’s desperate flight from the murder scene, his feverish, tormented state of mind afterwards, and the knot of suspicion and guilt that slowly but ineluctably closes around him. We identify with Raskolnikov, even though he’s not a particularly sympathetic character. People who assume, with no justification whatsoever, that they’re better than everyone else annoy me in general. Yet it’s testament to Dostoyevsky’s skills that we are able to experience Raskolnikov’s world as he experiences it, and are unable to condemn him outright. Raskolnikov is saved by suffering, and by the devoted love of the patient, sweet-natured prostitute Sonia. (And this is another thing that I love about Dostoyevsky: his ability to wring something of nobility and grandeur out of the most pitiful lives. Nobility? A murderer and his prostitute girlfriend? Oh, yes. Yes.)Raskolnikov’s crime is not simply the murders, but his arrogance in setting himself apart from (and above) his fellow beings. His punishment consists not simply of that meted out by the authorities, but in the inner repentance and self-loathing he feels. And with these, Dostoyevsky introduces the idea of redemption and salvation. Interwoven with Raskolnikov’s story, is the strangely parallel story of his enemy, the vile Svidrigailov, who has his own crimes to expiate – crimes that society would probably consider less serious, but which were committed by so darkened and dead a soul that there is little possibility of redemption in his case.Each character is given his or her unique characteristics and traits, and his or her own distinctive ‘voice’. They rub against each other, collide, collude, come together and go their separate ways. Yet we’re constantly drawn back to Raskolnikov, who serves as an emblem of both the depths to which humanity can sink and the greatness to which we can aspire. It’s not always an easy, still less a comforting, read, but if you want to fathom the murky depths of the human condition this is for you."
"920",919,"Michal","It was a great book. Some parts were a drag to read while other parts were page turners. I guess from this book I noticed I like more dialogue in books and less detail."
"921",920,"Nikki","I have read this book THREE times (not a minor accomplishment considering its density), and I loved it more with each reading. Dostoyevsky addresses the human conscience as a question of circumstance and intent. The novel's protagonist, Rodion Raskolnikov rationalizes that ""extraordinary men"" transcend the law and can be excused of some crimes if they are perpetrated for the greater good. He tests this theory in his own life and is faced with the psychological implications of his actions. From the crime itself, to the unraveling of Raskolnikov's resolve, this story deals with the struggle of the good and evil in all of us. "
"922",921,"Elliot Chalom","I could write thousands of words about this excellent novel, in part because of the fantastic book group I joined to discuss it. But you wouldn't want to read my endless thoughts and I'd never do it justice anyway. Here's how you know this novel is worth your time and effort: I never thought I could spend six 90 minute sessions talking about a single book - that's 9 full hours! - and yet it wasn't nearly enough for Crime & Punishment. I could imagine talking about it for six more sessions, it's that complex and so full of wonderful detail. Dostoevsky is the master."
"923",922,"Diana Latham","Such a good novel of ""what a man thinks in his heart, so he is."" It isn't an easy read, at least for me, but has great characters, heart wrenching losses, amazing resilience and redemption. When one of the characters, a man who abandons his family for alcohol, announces that God loves him too, my frustration with him was changed to love. Beautifully done. "
"924",923,"Diletta","""Delitto e Castigo"" è l'esecuzione di un dramma. Un dramma interno e feroce. Ma non grida a voce altra e strepita. O meglio lo fa. Ma è anche basso, infido, strisciante. Il motivo stesso del delitto che Raskòl'nikov compie, ai danni di una vecchia usuraia e della sorella, non è chiaro fin dall'inizio. Per il denaro? Non proprio. Per vendetta? Beh, no. I motivi sono vari ovviamente, ma di fondo sussurra quel concetto di Raskòl'nikov stesso, il fatto che esistano ""uomini straordinari"", per i quali le leggi non esistono, ma che loro stessi sono la legge, superiore ad essa, affermati geni superando gli ostacoli. Senza indugio. Ma Raskòl'nikov crolla. Crolla per la voce della sua coscienza certo, ma crolla anche per il non superamento di certi confini, per la paranoia, per la mancata affermazione morale. Il crollo non è chiassoso. È un vero e proprio percorso di angoscia, paranoia appunto, con anche un'ansia quasi da romanzo giallo poi. I personaggi intorno a Raskòl'nikov sono tra i più vari, canaglie, portatrici di redenzione, amici veri. Non voglio dilungarmi sullo stile, se Dostoevskij piace, piace. La sua capacità di delineare la moralità e la brama sono tra le poche capaci di mettere davvero in atto la sceneggiatura di veri contrasti umani. Cinque stelle meritatissime."

I thought the book would be hard to read, considering it's a Russian classic, but I got through it surprisingly quickly. The emotion, the psychology, the political intrigue, the philosophy, the plot, the characters, the setting, the storytelling, and the prose are all you could ever want from a book.This is now one of my favorite books, and I am so glad that I decided to ask for it for my birthday. Do yourself a favor and look into this one if you're a fan of good murder stories that deal more with psychology than anything."

Suçluluk duygusunu tek başına taşıyamamak engel olmadı karakterin suçunu gizlememesine. Ne zaman ki en güvendiğiyle paylaştı, rahatladı, işte o zaman başkaları duydu ve olaylar gelişti.

Novel yg bab terakhirnya saia baca di malam ulang tahun saia--di gunung sambil menggigil kedinginan, hiking bersama teman yg sengaja ingin merayakan ulang tahun saia dengan membuat saia menderita-- ini, sempat membuat saia berhenti total membaca buku. selama 28 hari sesudah saia turun gunung, saia sama sekali tidak mau membaca buku apapun, takut tidak bisa menikmati kenikmatan membaca seperti saat membaca buku ini, meski akhirnya saia tersadar, masih ada banyak buku hebat lain yang yang terserak diantara sekian banyak ""buku sampah"" lainnya.2. Buku Crime and Punishment diceritakan dengan sangat hebat, punya kisah yang teramat memukau, karakter-karakter agung. Kisah detektif-pembunuhan ini mengupas sisi psikologi tergelap dan terdalam manusia, bagian paling liar dan paling kejam yang ada pada diri setiap orang yang tak pernah disadari. Thomas Mann, menyebut buku ini sebagai The Greatest Detective Story Ever Told dan dijadikan sumber inspirasi bagi Freud dalam memulai kajian psikoanalisisnya yang fenomenal. Dalam daftar buku terbaik sepanjang masa versi apapun, buku ini selalu bertengger manis di 10 besar.3. Yang mengagumkan dari novel tebal ini--sangat tebal!-- adalah detail yang kaya dalam menggambarkan suasana muram, keputusasaan, tragedi, sikap asosial, alienasi, sinisme, dan nihilisme, semuanya dipentaskan melalui pisau analisis tajam dalam tragedi kemanusiaan terbesar sekaligus paling mengerikan sepanjang masa.4. Selama membaca 9000 buku (ex. majalah, komik, buku pelajaran), kebanyakan novel yang saia baca adalah bergenre detektif-misteri-thriller-kriminal, dari buku2 itu, saia belajar banyak hal. Dulu pernah kejadian, ada seorang teman pernah mampir ke kostan. kebetulan saia sedang membaca buku Agatha Christie, teman saya nyeletuk bertanya, buat apa baca buku tentang pembunuhan seperti itu? memangnya saia mau menjadi seorang pembunuh? dengan nada sedikit mengancam dengan ekspresi sedingin mungkin saia berujar, ""bila diperlukan, saia bisa membunuh orang yang datang ke kostan saia dengan kemungkinan 6 cara yang tak bisa mengindikasikan bahwa saia pelakunya, ada 4 cara membunuh korban tanpa perlu membuat korban meronta-meronta berteriak, dan 7 cara keluar dari kostan saia sehingga tercipta alibi sempurna bagi saia""Sesaat saia berhenti berkata sambil memikirkan ada berapa kemungkinan lain cara saia bisa membunuh? dr kemungkinan-kemungkinan yang pernah saia sebutkan, setidaknya dg permutasi matematis, ada 168 cara membunuh! dan masih tertarik memikirkan kemungkinan lainnya, saat melihat senyum di wajah teman saia mendadak hilang dan wajahnya tampak lebih pucat Hehe, serius, dengan banyak membaca kisah2 kriminal, saia menjadi tau Bagaimana cara membunuh korban tanpa perlu mengotori diri dengan darah, bagaimana cara membunuh orang tanpa perlu meninggalkan/menghapus jejak yang mencurigakan, bagaimana cara membunuh korban dengan trik yang bakal membingungkan polisi tercerdas sekalipun, bagaimana cara membunuh dengan menciptakan alibi sempurna?. Ngeri? bagaimana kalau saia punya cara yang paling kejam diantara semuanya, Bagaimana cara membunuh orang tetapi tuduhannya teralihkan pada orang lain! Tapi, semua itu belum bisa mengalahkan cara keji yang saia dapatkan dari buku ini. yah, dengan sangat gamblang dan brilian, buku Crime and Punishment telah mengajarkan apa yg selama ini para pelaku kejahatan selalu luput melakukannya sehingga mereka dengan mudahnya mengaku pada polisi, buku ini menerangkan bagaimana cara kita melenyapkan perasaan bersalah karena membunuh!5.

"940",939,"Laurel Hicks","Tolstoy spent 1200 pages of War and Peace to refute the theory of the extraordinary man. Dostoevsky, it seems to me, did it very nicely with a few strokes of an ax. This was my first reading of Crime and Punishment since childhood, and it affected me almost as powerfully today as it did fifty years ago. All the logic in the world, Raskolnikov finally learned, (I hope) is no good if one begins with the wrong premise. There is no way I can really analyze a book by Dostoevsky: his writing is something that, kicking and screaming at times, one has to live."
"941",940,"Rosalía","How to write a review that is on the level of the book? How to describe how it has grasped me since the very beginning? How to say that I completely felt the way he felt, forgetting for the moment the reality outside the book? It was a pleasure to read it despite the title."
"942",941,"Corporal","Its funny how I came across this book. It caught my eye at a road side bookshop in Delhi as it was suggested by a friend of mine having a fine taste in literature. So I thought it would be a nice read for my two day train journey towards south of India. I am 21 years old and it was striking how close the ideas of Rodion Romanovitch matched mine. The book gives a fine insight of the psychology of a murderer with a conscience. It describes the misery of a student, the poverty in Russia. It also tells how cunning can people get to achieve what they want. I think if I had to summarize the book in one word I would choose the word Conscience. All through we are taken deep into the guilty conscience of Raskolnikov and we see the mental turmoil that he faces. Crime and punishment are related by causality. Punishment always follows crime however it is still not clear to me how this would be if the criminal does not have a conscience? Another point that was not clear to me was Sonia. Sonia I think could have been omitted from the story. If Raskolnikov had stayed for few more months like that he would have eventually confessed his crime. What was the need of putting Sonia into the story? Ofcourse she is the religious pivot of the story but then it only sums up to the possible fact that Dostoevsky was himself religious and then for me it does not undertake any deeper meaning.This book left me with tears and a smile at the same time... The last chapter, how it ends... Its only seven more years, they will seem like only seven days when they meet again..."

"948",947,"Jed L","This book is in my top five. It is a masterpiece of human emotion and character. I will try not to give anything away, but in Crime and Punishment Dostoevsky delves into the inner psyche of both the saint and the sinner. He looks into the thought processes of them, their emotions, their desires and creates a fascinating plot that both intrigues and disturbs the reader. In the end, you sympathize with a drunkard, you root for a murderer and you love a prostitute. Dostoevsky creates a bridge for readers to cross to better understand the base and low of humans and see that they aren't that different from the rest of us, and sometimes, they are better. "

"954",953,"Jennifer Spiegel","RASKOLNIKOV'S BED: I AM HAUNTED. This originally appeared on my blog, ""Bosco's Going Down.""------As promised, a blog post on Raskolnikov’s bed. It dawned on me, a few pages into my freakin’ fourth read of the book, that I have been haunted—I mean, haunted—by the image of his tiny, disheveled, slab/cot/couch in his dirty hovel of an apartment in St. Petersburg, Russia. I have this image of that bed with the twisted sheets on stained cushions imprinted on my brain, ready in a moment’s notice to speak to me about passion and anguish. Smitten by Raskolnikov’s murky death wish as early as sixteen, I carried it with me into my forties.This, no doubt, sounds sick and wrong.The haunting. The crazy, unconscious thing is that I’ve written this bed—with the strewn sheets (strewn in the only word for those sheets)--into my own fiction two times. I didn’t even know what I was doing. First, Love Slave. In an original draft, Sybil goes home with an artist and has a one-night stand—in a tiny, gross apartment somewhere near the Bowery, near the now-defunct CBGB’s, with Raskolnikov’s bed right there. Probably on the bed!The scene did not make it into the novel. I cut it. Because I just thought, You know what? I don’t want Sybil to have a one-night stand!So, the bed disappeared.Then, after that (even though the novel came out after the story collection, I wrote this story after the novel—it’s a little confusing), I wrote “Glasnost,” a short story, which appears in The Freak Chronicles. What do you know? There’s another artist with an apartment and a bed . . . and this time, it’s in St. Petersburg! The story still exists with the bed in it.Interestingly enough, I kept adding an artist into the equation.I really didn’t put two and two together till just recently: I’m obsessed with Raskolnikov’s bed! What’s up with that?Before the pervs take this and run, let me retrace my readings of this novel.The first time I read it was in high school, and I had to be about sixteen. Then, the book was like dope (can’t believe I wrote that). I sorta remember melting over the pages, dripping over the edges of furniture. I had been turned into liquid. The humanity, the guilt, the heart hurting: I fell apart. I think I was in love with Raskolnikov, who seemed—at the time—pretty manly to me. I think my friend Laura loved Razumikhin, and I now know this is the better choice. Obviously, I was a deeply disturbed girl. Yes, this is the truth: I found amazing solace and affirmation—dear God, we’re talking affirmation—in the way Dostoyevsky revealed the weight of sin. It was the weight of sin. Had anyone ever taken sin so seriously? And another thing: the guilt. I got that. At sixteen, I felt super guilty about stuff, just life and shit. Guilty girl. I guess that time I chopped up the pawnbroker with an axe really did me in.The second time I read it was during college, in a Russian Humanities class. I suppose this was the most lackluster time, though, well, there is this: I ended up going to Russia for a university language program, living for a month in Leningrad (St. Petersburg), and I really did go back to some guy’s apartment and he really did have one of those beds with the strewn sheets.Yes, he was an artist. Of course he was an artist!What do you think?The third time I read it happened to be the summer my father died in a car accident. That summer, I remember reading two books: Crime and Punishment and Dave Eggers’ A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. I think I just wanted to re-read Dostoyevsky; it had been a little over ten years. Now, those two books are forever associated with my father’s death. They’re fitting, are they not? Do they not both speak about the value of life? (This is, incidentally, one reason—among others—I’m not really into dissing Eggers, which seems to be something many of my cohorts like to do.)The fourth time was just now. I’m teaching it. I didn’t love it as much, though I still loved it. I guess that different things speak to readers at different times. I remember my high school teacher suggesting that Raskolnikov’s resolution was insufficient; he did not adequately come to terms with his crime. I might accidentally misrepresent him, and even though he’s not reading my post, I’d rather not do that. In Crime and Punishment, is it fair to say that the solution to the crime is that love conquers all? Raskolnikov is “saved” from his sin by love, redeemed through Sonya’s love. My high school teacher suggested that this is not a sufficient solution to the problem of evil. I kinda wanted to not pay attention to him, thinking him a bit of a literary killjoy, since he didn’t even like The Catcher in the Rye, which obviously implies a character flaw. But, well, I think he’s right: the love of a good woman, even a whore with a heart of gold, will not suffice in removing the blood on Raskolnikov’s hands.Here’s what I think, though—and I’m going to leave it at this: Dostoyevsky makes a noble effort in dealing with sin in a secular way. Ultimately, his secular solution to the problem of evil doesn’t cut it.But this book, which is a ghost that forever lurks in my life, still sings. This time, I felt the weight of other words. Remember Raskolnikov’s dream in Siberia: “Everyone was to perish, except for certain, very few, chosen ones. Some new trichinae had appeared, microscopic creatures that lodged themselves in men’s bodies. But these creatures were spirits, endowed with reason and will. Those who received them into themselves immediately became possessed and mad. But never, never had people considered themselves so intelligent and unshakeable in the truth as did these infected ones.” Ah, this was Raskolnikov! He felt free to sin! Madness! Combined with pomposity! This time around, this is what gets me. Dostoyevsky does fail to truly address why this crime is wrong. He does fail to offer anything other than this murky conception of suffering and love. He does, though, offer this: an astute vision of the faux-intelligentsia.I’ll probably read this again. I’ll no doubt stop at the foot of Raskolnikov’s unkempt bed. I’ll hesitate, look down, scoff, sink in, smell the sheets, want to change them, pull them over my head, and sleep. Sleep with that Russian dude. Tell him to get his life in order because we’re apparently in this together. "

"958",957,"Lily Tun","I would give it the 100 stars if I could. I read this during my senior year to prepare for a test and I could not have chosen a better book. I was a little hesitant because everyone said this was a heavy book and it is but It is so worth it! This is not about solving a murder but solving how a murderer can achieve salvation and how it troubles him. Raskonilkov is not a hero, he is not entirely a villain either. Everyone in this book is very complicated. Sonia is my favourite character in this book. She is so nice and so strong that you forget how old she is. If you're thinking about reading it, don't doubt yourself. Go ahead and read it. It will make you think about stuff you have never thought of before. The book also has a cute ending. "

"964",963,"Camelia"," Am citit aceast roman pentru a doua oară acum la 17 ani.Mai citisem cartea atunci când aveam 13 ani și țineam minte subiectul și numele personajelor. Singura problemă era că nu am fost la fel de profund atinsă de complexitatea psihologică înâlnită în fiecare roman al lui Dostoievski.Da,Dostoievski a fost un mare psiholog.În romanele lui,protagoniștii se luptă cu ei înșiși,cu viața,cu sărăcia,cu mizeria. Iar după cum îi spunea Marmeladov lui Raskolnikov când s-au cunoscut în acea cârciumă:""Stimate domn,începu el aproape solemn,sărăcia nu e un viciu,iată un adevăr indubitabil.Dar nici beția nu e o virtute-cu atât mai puțin.Însă mizeria,stimate domn,mizeria e un viciu.În sărăcie,omul își mai păstrează noblețea înnascută a sufletului,îm mizerie-nimeni niciodată"" Raskolnikov,ca orice intelectual este frământat de tot felul de idei și vise irealizabile care l-ar putea scoate din mizeria în care se află de ceva timp. Renunțând până și la facultate,aceasta se prăbușește într-o vacuitate existențială,nemaipăsându-i de mama și sora lui care îi poartă o dragoste inconmensurabilă și care și-ar da și sufletul pentru el,Rodia al lor.Deși mama lui încearcă să-l ajute financiar așa cum poate ea mai bine,Raskolnikov nu se descurcă cu puținii bani ai acesteia și se gândește la o soluție ce l-ar putea salva. Acesta decide să o ucidă pe Aliona Ivanovna,o bătrână pe care el o considera o scorpie,""un păduche ""și la care își amaneta puținele bunuri rămase..Planul lui Raskolnikov nu decurge așa cum trebuie și acesta e nevoit sa o ucidă și pe sora bâtrânei,care are ghinionul de a apărea la locul crimei. După vărsarea sângelui celor două femei,Raskolnikov realizează ca el nu s-a gândit de unde ar putea fura banii femeii,încât se vede nevoit să fure câteva bijuterii pe care le găsește în urma unei căutări rapide și superficiale.Fugind de la locul faptei,începe să realizeze ce a făcut,iar sperietura de a nu fi prins îl induce într-o stare de depresie și tulburare psihică. Un lucru care mi-a placut și m-a interesat a fost faptul că Raskolnikov nu s-a folosit de bunurile furate de la bătrână. Să nu fi fost oare acesta motivul crimei?Așa cum i-a spus Soniei,el s-a văzut un Napoleon care pentru a atinge succescul a fost nevoite să zdrobească sufletele oamenilor. O carte excepțională! Un roman ce ne invită să urmărim și să apreciem sufeltul unui tânăr care dintr-un intelectual zdrobit de situația financiară și cu gândurile mereu învălmășite, săvârșește o crimă teribilă și deși nu se căiește nici atunci când este închis la închisoare,Raskolnikov descoperă ce înseamnă dragostea,credința în Dumnezeu și își deschide sufletul față de ceilalți,visând la ziua în care va putea lua viața de la capăt."
"965",964,"David Cole","This book is a classic, but psychologically it still compels. The level of detail, and the backstory behind Dostoyevsky's writing it, are definite selling points. The play reveals so much about the author's belief system and the morality of his time (and ours). Generally, I'm not a huge fan of Russian literature but this book works for me. It's not a light read, but worth the investment."

"970",969,"Tiny Raymond","I read this pretty late (in the present middle age), having read most of Tolstoy and Chekhov in my youth. I was scared that this writer would be ""difficult"", on the contrary! It is a measure of his skill as a writer that reading this book was such a rewarding experience proving my theory (which I'm sure is not original) that when reading a book becomes a task, it is not due to the lack of wit of the reader but rather to the clumsiness of the writer."

"973",972,"J. Paredes","Excellent book. I have actually read it 3 times, one of the three was a school requirement.

Reading it was more of a spiritual experience. "
"975",974,"Greta","I debated giving this book four stars because there were parts in which I found myself getting a bit bored with all the detail Dostoevsky included. But in the end I found it to be an epic story where the reader is really able to get into the heads of the characters. So, while there are two or three instances of ""something happening"" and the rest of the book deals with the people dealing with what happened, I give it five stars because the author really did prove he knows how to tell a story and bring the reader fully into it. A truly psychological novel and a work of art."
"976",975,"s","“To go wrong in one's own way is better then to go right in someone else's.” One of my favorite books. Remember reading it over a long period of time in 2010 during my stay in Austin, TX - sitting outside in cafes and hookah bars along Guadalupe street.While I don't recall many of the other characters very well after all this time, the book's protagonist has stayed with me. Roskolnikov is troubled in many ways - esp the alienation bit, where he won't seek help or support from those willing to offer and instead considers himself above the rest and is intensely proud - justifying deeds on the pretext of a higher purpose. Going through the novel was like living the life of a criminal - involving all the fears and doubts and suspicion. It was as if the reader gets convinced that leading a life like this is much tougher than any punishment the world has to offer. Sitting outdoors and taking long walks in chilly winters in Austin made me feel through a bit more of the poverty-striken life in Russia that the novel portrays. One of the reasons I may not read it again is so that even the book cover reminds me of that memorable time"
"977",976,"Philip Sweet","I finished this book in a little over 2 weeks. I say that not to brag but to express how completely I was taken over by this story. The characters jump off the page, their every action and though pulses with unquestionably distinct life. I found the last 2 books (5-6) the most interesting but was a little disappointed with the epilogue. Not because it was bad, but because after the stressful build up (I often found myself reading in a near frenzy) of the first 500 pages to the final climax at the end of book six, the epilogue feels dull. If you're debating reading this book, debate no longer! Just read it and allow yourself to be carried away by twisted thoughts of murder and human worthlessness contrasted constantly with acts of undying love and glorious humanity. "

"986",985,"Athul Domichen","'Crime and Punishment' tells the story of Raskolnikov, a student. Raskolnikov- his mind, his ways, his thoughts, his crime, his anguish, his family, his world, his philosophy- are all capable of changing your perceptions on many things. Finally, I get a proper taste of what the world of Dostoevsky is. The abridged versions of many works of authors like him I read as a kid does no justice to the feel that classics like 'Crime and Punishment' gives, nor would I have been able to comprehend the complexities of thoughts at that age. Some things are only to be read, seen, and perceived at the right time in life. Even though at first I got confused with the names of the characters (like I did for Bulgakov's Master and Margarita), now I can't forget most of those names. I want to think like Raskolnikov, be like Razumikhin, love someone like Sonya does, hope and be brave like Dunya does, destroy manipulators like Petyr Petrovich- the novel made me associate with many of their thoughts and deeds. Crime and Punishment was an emotional journey for me. I will revisit the novel after some months I guess- looking forward to reading more of Dostoevsky. "
"987",986,"Shivam Chaturvedi","""I like living. I have sometimes been wildly, despairingly, acutely miserable, racked with sorrow, but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing.""- Agatha ChristieCrime and Punishment proved to be one of those rare breed of books that well and truly break through the outer facade and leave behind a permanent impression, even if its a dark and hideous one.Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky died a 110 years ago before I was born, and yet all through the while that I was reading Crime and Punishment, it felt like he must have written this books for me and me alone. It was almost as if he could see through time you know; like a known face reaching out from an unknown, distant pass. I found Raskolnikov's actions and world view to be eerily similar to that of mine, as if I was looking through his eyes. Or if he was looking through mine eyes instead; one and the same. Now mind you, this is not necessarily how the world is, only this is how he chose to see it. Or perhaps this was the only way he was capable of seeing it. Note the difference between the two, for Dostoyevksy not once accuses Raskolnikov of a crime. He lets us, the readers, decide for ourselves about that. That, however, is right about the only slack he cuts him.Everywhere else he scythes through his 'protagonist'. Lays bare his twisted and conceited thoughts, practically strips him naked. And that is where I found myself cringing. Raskolnikov's biggest flaws, his worst nightmares, his darkest secrets were all mine. But this wasn't it. Every time I looked up from these accursed pages, I could almost imagine Dostoyevsky sitting off across me. With a smirk on his face he would say, ""You really thought no one would ever know?""Add to this the fact that beyond a point in this book, Nina Simone's beautiful rendition of Sinnerman would not stop playing in my head. You know you're in love with a book when mere words on a scrap of page (although Dostoyevsky's are hardly 'mere words' to be honest) can spring in your head one of your favorite tunes. English is not the most evocative language in the world; am afraid that honour must go to Urdu. Yet, the force behind these 'mere words' is one to reckon with, and I learnt it the most beautiful way.And to top it all, Sonya. I am a sucker for simplicity and her character was delightfully attractive and fascinating. As is, I found her and Raskolnikov's a better story than most that I see around myself, real or imaginary world whichever. Should I feel too stupid to wish happiness for them? I think not, because its not too bad to have a little bit of hope at times. And that is what I realized Dostoyevsky was trying to tell us too - that there is hope and redemption for the worst of us. Raskolnikov and SonyaSo yes, living is worth the while. So said Madam Christie..so said Raskolnikov too, and Dostoyevsky. So say I."

I read Garnett's version, having failed to find a P/V version which I've seen rave reviews of), but the story absolutely shines. Dostoevsky intertwines psychology and philosophy to tell the tale of Raskolnikov, a poor student who commits a crime, believing himself to be above the law. Each character is finely crafted to represent a certain philosophical line of thought, giving the reader plenty to ponder. Dostoevsky isn't afraid to delve into the dark recesses of the human soul. The book is compelling, meditative and suspenseful, a very engrossing read."

"995",994,"Evan","I finally got around to reading this (yes, shame on my Russian major and all that) and I think I may have missed the window: in the interim I've internalized every jot and tittle of the European Romantic novel and this is Exhibit A, so the handwringing, the plot twists, the sturm and even the drang were not all that exciting. Good thing Dostoyevski is a genius of quick images -- details that only matter if you're paying attention, but if you're going through with a comb, they add up to create an image plot that doubles the characters' plot. So that's where the twistiness and the excitement of the novel is -- and that's what I'd recommend to those of you who've read enough Romantic novels to choke a thin, overwrought student struggling with issues of fundamental importance and slowly going mad with the emotional exertion."

Siempre pienso que los libros son para leer y releer, siempre encontraremos una historia diferente, pues le estará hablando a la persona diferente que ahora somos.Por esto, asi como las mentes pervertidas que descubren formas lujuriosas en manchas de tinta, alli donde a mis 14 solo habia visto culpa, ahora con mas años, veo engaños y astucia, complicidades, histeria, por encima de todo veo una sociedad pacata y enfermiza, ocupada en atacar el mal como un ciego que da escobazos a las moscas, destruyendo pensamientos frágiles de conciencias profundas, defendiendo viejas costumbres de ambiciones largas como uñas de arpia.Un grande Dostoyevsky"
"997",996,"Harsha Shetty","Raskolnikov, a hypochondriacal monomaniac, on receiving a letter from his mother, murders an old pawnbroker and what follows is an intense and a brilliantly written story of redemption, love and sacrifice. The protagonist's inner struggle and his continued attempts to convince his own conscience about the legitimacy of the murder are etched in as absorbing a manner as possible. I couldn't get rid of the book for a whole weekend and I think it wouldn't be long before I start reading it again.

"998",997,"Olivia Mu lee","I'm sure many an oblivious teenager has picked up C&R expecting some sort of 50 shades ripoff(That title yo) unless they bothered to notice they were in the classics section and after the first chapter, would have thrown it down in childish disappointment. Well I'm here at the end of this horrendously long-winded book to tell you not to put it at the back of your bookshelf with the rest of the books your parents gave you. And when I say long-winded, it's not really about the length of the book, but rather the amount of philosophical rambling that makes you read paragraphs twice over. Keep in mind I did finish like 4 of the GOT series, or as you nitpickers would say ""ASOIAF"", of which each book is longer than C&R (I think...). Anyway, as I've already established, the book has its flaws, but my five star rating comes mostly from three factors.1. My overall enjoyment of the book: Great. Frustrating at times, but don't we all like being emotionally compromised by ink on a page written over 100 years ago? ...Ok, just me then.2. The amount of time thinking about the book after it had been finished: It's been a week. Which is a record for me, I can't even remember to take daily medication (fortunately the non-lifesaving kind).3. The ability of good 'ol Fyodor to make me like a psychopath: I know. I'm cringing at that sentence too. Don't condemn me just yet. I will try a little psychological unraveling of Raskolnikov myself.Ok so this dude is crazy. Like kill an elderly woman with an ax crazy. And no, I don't think it's ok just because she is slightly more compassionate than Scrooge. He has a god complex (death note, anyone?) and he loves animals which reminds of some other famous historical figures of the genocidal kind. Starts with an H, if you didn't get that reference. Raskolnikov is like a modern day stockbroker. He has the creds to impress the average schmuck into thinking he is some kind of bigshot, but in reality he's having an existential crisis that makes him daydream about stuffing his boss through the paper shredder. Despite all this, it's the relationships he has with family and other characters throughout the book that make him likable. He's sarcastic and abrasive, but his entertaining exchanges with the cast of supporting characters lighten the mood, and ultimately have you hoping Raskolnikov will change his ways. If anything, read it for the impact it had on the literary genre of crime drama. C&P is the rambling grandpa of your James Patterson novels."
"999",998,"Rudy Castaneda"," Dostoevsky builds a complex and amazingly fresh narrative out of a relatively simple question; can a person rationalize immoral behaviour and live with the consequences of his decisions? The protagonist, Raskolnikov, kills an old pawnbroker and her sister in support of a philosophical stance that postulates that extraordinary individuals have the right to transgress against conventional laws and morality. This idea predates Nietzsche’s concept of the Übermensch by seventeen years. The rest of the novel with its plethora of interweaving characters and subplots revolves around Raskolnikov’s journey towards eventual confession, prison and ultimately his redemption. The narrative is told in the third-person omnipotent which allows effectively for characters besides the protagonist to reveal their thoughts and feelings. The internal voice of Raskolnikov, which makes up the major part of the narrative, is more of an internal dialog as opposed to a monolog. The punishment of the title is not the political punishment of penal restitution for a crime committed against the state but the torturous personal aftermath of the moral sin. This is primarily manifested through Raskolnikov’s internal dialog throughout the whole novel; it is how we realize his suffering.  I was also surprised at the astutely observed psychological reality of the characters, their actions and reactions. Significantly, Raskolnikov himself is not a very likable character; he is arrogant, misguided, rude and even in some cases unkind. Yet, he is repeatedly redeemed in our eyes by his generosity to the poor and needy and his compassion for the daughter of the landlady and of the drunkard Marmeladov’s daughter, Sonia.  I really like the character of Razumikhin. His good nature, generosity and romantic leaning makes him a more sympathetic character than Raskolnikov. In a sense he starts to act as a surrogate brother and son to Raskolnikov’s family eventually marrying Raskolnikov’s sister, Avdotya (Dounia) Romanovna. Hardly a character escapes having flaws that make the personalities fully human and believable with the possible exception of Dounia who is as flawless morally as she is beautiful. Relatively minor characters like the doctor, Zossimov, the magistrate Porfiry Petrovich, Marmeladov and his family are all meticulously drawn. Interestingly, reference is made several times in the text to psychology but that separate field of science (is it a science?) was not established until thirteen years later in 1879.  Although the book grows increasingly melodramatic as it develops (culminating in the attack on Dounia by the thoroughly disagreeable Svidrigailov and his subsequent suicide) it does not pander to other conventions of the time like gross sentimentality and overt Christianity. The city of St. Petersburg is a stand-alone character in the story; Dostoevsky’s opening description of it as hot and dusty is a suitably uncomfortable setting for his intended crime. The contrasts between the exceeding beauty and grandeur of the city, which would have been well known to his audience, and the abject poverty of the inhabitants in his orbit is very dramatic.  Dreams are used to great symbolic effect to reinforce the action; Raskolnikov’s dream of the beating a horse was almost unbearably shocking, his dream of drinking cool water in the dessert (p.68) was a peaceful contrast to the shock of his next action; preparation for the kill.  Of note, although the narrative is generally serious I was amused by his use of humour in scenes such as in the police station when Ilya Petrovich’s remarks about authors (Dostoevsky, 1866, p.99).  There were only a couple of criticisms that I have:I was surprised by Porfiry Petrovich’s revelation about Raskolnikov’s essay; until then I could not understand his rationale for the killings. On this point I was not entirely convinced.  The Russian convention of using first and second names, the plethora of characters and the ins- and-outs of the plot made for very close attention and having to often re-read for clarity.Having said this, I was especially glad to read this again after thirty years. It does not age, although I do interpret it differently now than I did back then, it remains amongst the very best books I have ever read. "
"1000",999,"Phil","Probably my favorite of the classics. Reading it in high school seemed like such an accomplishment! I really enjoyed Dostoevsky's infusion of psychology and philosophy into this tale of transgression, delusion, and redemption."
"1001",1000,"Diana Ray","Best of all attempts at human drama in story form. Did you know that Woody Allen's movie ""Matchpoint"" is a translation of this novel. Weird to discover it in Hollywood, somehow incongruous. Dostoevsky is a master with words, storytelling, hands down."
"1002",1001,"Agathe","Crime et Châtiment (Crime and Punishment) - Fyodor Dostoyevsky -  I read it in : French-  What it’s about  : A Russian young man living in St Petersburg, Raskolnikov, who, as soon as he’s killed an old usurer, falls into insanity and madness.This book is just great. I had picked it up a few years ago but couldn’t get through the first pages somehow. This time, I was determined to read the entire novel. And wasn’t disappointed. I won’t lie: some parts were very slow, boring even: I had the feeling that the author wasn’t very coherent in his writing. But then, I realized that it’s probably how Raskolnikov (the main character) was in his thoughts, confused, lost, never managing to keep track of anything. Some scenes are very well written also, full of a metaphorical meaning that leads the rest of the book to its final goal. I guess I haven't really understood the different purposes of the book, the author's different thesis, and the whole meaning of the novel yet, but I definitely intend on re-reading it some time later to analyse it with more hindsight.

"1004",1003,"Henry Sturcke","To read a long Russian novel is like falling down a rabbit hole and landing in a strange parallel world, eerily similar to ours, but with distortions and inversions. On second thought, that doesn’t apply to Tolstoy, whose world, despite its distance in time and space, is recognizably ours. But it is so for Dostoevsky. Whether this something you will enjoy, or even appreciate, is not a given.	It’s been forty-five years since I read this book. As in almost all well-told tales, I identified with the protagonist. But in this case, what a trip it was. For weeks, I was Raskolnikov. Although the book didn’t drive me to pick up an axe and butcher an old lady, for days on end, even after putting down the book and going about my daily chores, I felt what it was like to live with the dark knowledge of having done so.	Perhaps the book is not perfect. The heroine, Sonya the virtuous prostitute, is a bit too saintly to be believed, but the book worked for me as a narrative unfolding of crime and its inexorable punishment, or, as the Russian words of the title can also be translated, guilt and expiation.	Although I doubt this is a book everyone will enjoy, the combination of the impact it made on me long ago and the clear memory of that impact make it a five star for me. That's a rating I try to reserve for books that have become part of my mental furniture."
"1005",1004,"Ciudadana Herzeleid","Conozco poco la obra de Dovstoyevski, y es que ¡vamos!¡habla de una Rusia inexistente! Pero no es cuestión de que si me acercamiento fuera difícil o no, pues mis antecedentes como ""El jugador"" y ""Las noches blancas"" se me hicieron tranquilos, pero este libro fue uno peso pesado ¿por qué? pues porque necesita sus antecedentes históricos y filosóficos. Aunque hable de la miseria de la época, la cuestión es concentrarse en la historia de Raskalnikov, un jóven universitario que dejo de serlo para ver qué otra cosa podía ser. Sus acciones lo llevan a asesinar a una vieja avara (y no digo eso como algo peyorativo, si no que realmente la personaje se hace odiar cuando casi sentimos el hambre y la desesperación de Raskolnikov). Al ser larga la historia, también lo es la percepción de los hechos, y uno se pierde entre largas cartas y entre visitas a la comisaría, más los hechos que ocurren alrededor. Se entiende que muchos se alejen del libro porque como dice el título de un artículo ""Libros que te has perdido porque tus maestros los han arruinado"", pero la verdad en el caso de esta novela es pesada. Y yo misma me pregunté por qué no tenía la ligereza de las otras obras que leí, hasta que comprendí que efectivamente fue escrita con largo aliento. Pero pese a esto, pensando en que había tropezado muchas veces, llegué al final, cuando ya pasa por la prisión siberiana y en donde Raskolnikov debe inmolarse, y lo logra. Por lo que es casi la historia de una vida. Me llama la atención que dicen que es novela de carater psicológico, y creo que esta forma de decirlo es como una cosa más para complicarla ¿por qué no puede caer en historia policiaca con una ficción biográfica? pues porque en la época de Dostoyevsky no había una definición tan clara como hoy. Lo que sí lamento es no haberlo leído antes. Merecerá más lecturas, pues a pesar de que en la emoción estética me gustó mucho, siento que me faltó imaginación pues a veces no me quedaban claros los paisajes y las descripciones, pero esto ya es una limitación de una humilde lectora que le falta conocer más sobre paisajes y fríos invernales descritos. De ahí en fuera ¡altamente recomendable! "
"1006",1005,"Rawda Hegazy",""" I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity "" Russian literature is often a challenge, but one that is generally rewarded if the reader is brave enough to dive into the worlds of such literary greats as Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. This classic Russian novel, considered one of the masterpieces and cornerstones of world literature, is a tale of misery, poverty and murder, with little or no humour but ample pathos and melodrama. Wonderful book. Amazing descriptions of a St Petersburg from another time which can still be found there today and a story with a challenging moral question at its heart."
"1007",1006,"David Tye","A great book in understanding how human emotions and guilt from committing a murder eventually unravel the protagonist's mind. Dostoyevsky is brilliant in capturing the emotions behind such a horrible crime."
"1008",1007,"Barbara","Still my favorite book of all time. Finding a good translation is a must. Either McDuff or Pevear, a new husband-wife translation team. Don't bother reading Constance Garnett, she sapped the life out of all the Russian lit she translated. Raskolnikov, the radical law student, remains a compelling character on the verge of nervous breakdown. You can feel his highs and lows, his exhilaration and his paranoid madness. This is a thrill ride after the first 200 pages. St Petersburg in the 1850s has all the sad, beaten down and sleazy characters that could have seen in 1970s nyc. Still relevant today. What happens when everything is permitted and there is no God?"

"1012",1011,"K.J. Kron","There's so much to say about this book. First, the main character is the typical anti-hero - what's to like? But that makes the book funny as he does things that you can't believe. There's also such tension in certain places. The scene where he just committed the crime and he narrowly escapes. Or when he's being questioned by the lawyer. Or his confrontations...When modern writers say they want to get in the heads of the criminal, they should read this first. Very enjoyable - even as a classic, this is an easy read - with comic relief.The only knock I'd have is this: 1., the characters are verbose. At times this makes for an interesting read as I can imagine these long winded characters. The main one has long winded thoughts, but is often brief when he speaks. I don't mean this as a knock, but he might be Christian? The end lead me to belief this - the hero or anti-hero almost has Christ-like moments. "
"1013",1012,"Pratul Bagri","There are certain books which come into our lives at the right time. I am lucky that hitherto there have been two of them. The first is The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole aged 13 ¾ and the second is the classic, Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Crime and Punishment is the first of its kind I have read till now and opens door for a whole new genre in my modest reading career.The most symbolic message in the novel is poverty. I am extremely lucky that I can eat food three times a day and also extremely lucky that I have realized this fact early in my life all thanks to Mr. Dostoyevsky. My attraction for this book is justified by the fact that the protagonist, Raskolinkov and I share same ideals, questions, moral dilemmas and egoistic personality. The “killing for greater good” conundrum is beautifully illustrated. The book is full of powerful and enigmatic characters. My favorite is Sonia. Her devotion towards her family, love and understanding for a killer is meritorious. She didn’t take the easy way out like Svidrigailov nor did she blame her problems as fault of other people like Raskoinkov did. Instead of fixing the world, she tried to fix herself and lived for others sake. Rakolinkov terms her behavior as religious mania, we can rationalize almost everything but the capital T truth is we all need some moral code to believe in otherwise we go crazy, Rodion being the prime example.The cat and mouse chase between Rodion and Porfiry Petrovich is nothing short of spectacular. It is a battle of wits and philosophies and reminds me of the extraordinary anime Death Note. I particularly liked the ending of the book because it gives the readers closure. Crime and punishment is a splendid tale of tragedy, friendship, poverty, love, mystery and cure."
"1014",1013,"Marie Østvold","This is a great book, in every meaning of the word. I'm not sure who I'm more taken with, Raskolnikov or Razumikhin. "
"1015",1014,"Mel Tracy","Without a doubt the most depressing beginning to any store ever. The whole bit about the ""lipstick being expensive"" thing is pure evil depressing genius. What kind of a mind comes up with a story like this? The long slow, ok not that slow, decent in to madness and despair. Yet, we never quite reach hopelessness. Maybe I would have, but the story marches on past that, to a point where redemption, not the clean slate kind of prodigal son type of redemption, but a dirty gritty, I can carry on, and maybe yet again I will smile and find joy some day, kind of redemption. Oh, yeah and the bit about how it's the first psychological thriller. I also figured out at some point that I could no longer trust the protagonist(?) to be giving the straight dope. That's a neat trick for an author to pull off."

"1017",1016,"Dale Houstman","I read this book (long described by acquaintances as a ""typically"" difficult Russian tramp through dark, heavy, and frozen mud) while working as an attendant at a parking ramp. It was amusing to have people drive out and ask me what book I was laughing at so readily, and to see their faces when I told them what it was. Just like that other writer who emerged out of Dickens, Kafka, Dostoevsky does not fail to learn the lessons of Dickens' gothic humor, as well as his social criticism and class horrors. The fact is, this novel is black humor at its finest, and it is no surprise that that humorous TV detective show ""Columbo"" should have emerged from the central relationship in this novel, between the ""Napoleon of crime"" and the relentless but witty - even sardonically understanding - police detective. A man who fancied himself as a new generation criminal, able to commit a random murder without feeling or intent, is reduced to lying on his shabby bed and staring into a hole in the wall. I found each page more hilarious and excruciating than the one before it, and the internal fretting and building dread of the murderer is a fascinating study in the fallacy of modernity, of alienation from morality, and a satire on the utopian ideals Dostoevsky had once embraced but now found lacking. This - as humorous literature goes - is not the big-hearted adventurism of the Pickwick Club, or the stuff of an evening's relaxation, but it IS funny, even as it cuts. "

"1020",1019,"Mauro Barea","Una novela 5 estrellas desde cualquier punto donde se le mire. Un clásico entre clásicos, una novela completa y que abarca todos los espectros o la mayor de las mayores partes de la complejidad humana. Sin duda un reóstato que Dostoievski mueve a su antojo y nos deja en una larga novela para continuar debatiendo y analizando todavía por mucho más tiempo sus teorías increíbles y que todavía causan interés por su complejidad y atemporalidad. Una de las curiosidades es que el mismo Fiódor nos habla de vez en cuando, directamente, a lo largo de la novela y en la línea final, con una sutileza formidable."
"1021",1020,"Landon Kramer","Finally doing Dostoyevsky, a few streets away from where he wrote his biggest works. Wild. Crime and Punishment wasn't fun reading, especially in the span of just over a week. Dostoyevsky's an unpleasant stylist in an oppressive setting. Every nobody in his neighborhood can spin a great story, but this means trudging for the reader. I'd call the plot ""anxious"" rather than ""suspenseful,"" for the most part. The book gets five stars because despite all the sweat and dust, it was the most religious read I've ever had. Meaning it's structure, characters, and philosophical interrogations seemed to immerse me in a vaguely Christian experience I hadn't touched before. On a more pragmatic level, C&P suggests a psychological encyclopedia. You can talk about it forever. Compressing the setting, cast and timeframe makes more room for invisible content. So it's an inherently profound project. I can't say I'm sad to take a break now with the Symbolists, though. Glad to see colors other than dead yellow. "

Extreem wat betref gebeurtenissen, karakters en filosofische denkwijzen zonder dat het de grens van bullshit overschrijdt. Daardoor een erg boeiend boek naar mijn mening die boeit tot de laatste pagina. Ik heb ook erg genoten van de mind games, dubbele agenda's van de karakters en de scherpe dialogen. Echt een ware klassieker die de tand des tijds goed heeft doorstaan. "
"1024",1023,"Jamie Wilkinson"," No words can express my love for this book... well, maybe these can: I completely adore any kind of unlikely protagonist and this case was no different. Raskolnikov utterly won me over from his very first insane ramble of a monologue. Descriptions were terribly vivid and emotions were heightened to the point where I could experience them myself.  Though I did read the David McDuff translation of the novel I trust that any of these authors did justice to the original, but since McDuff's was the first I read it will always be held closest to my heart. Dostoevsky is, without argument, an incredible author and I have no doubt that this book will remain among my favorites for the rest of my life."

"1034",1033,"Carol","What is it about those Russkies that we find so captivating? Russian authors are so different than everyone else. The intellectual class has always been drawn to philosophical ideas. As young university students they want to try out these ideas. So here we have Raskolnikov, a penniless St. Petersburg university student, who wonders if he has what it takes to commit a murder. Most people have not thought about committing a murder but our hero is completely consumed with this idea. He thinks that with this one act and the money he can gain that he will then be able to make his way in the world. He has a rather high opinion of himself and believes that the good that comes from this one act will exceed the evil of it -- the end justifies the means.I read this book in high school and was totally drawn into it. Reading it some 50 years later was just as absorbing plus I understood it a bit better the second time around. Dostoevsky is a master at understanding human psychology. He takes us into Raskolnikov's mind -- the mind of a man who kills for an idea. All the above takes place early in the book and we then follow him through various stages.I, like many others, question the end of the book. Is it likely that such a person would make such a complete turnaround? I think not. But here is where religion gets in the way for Dostoevsky as it does for Tolstoy -- their belief in redemption. But this is minor stuff that we can forgive and forget.Dostoevsky penetrates human psychology better than anyone I can think of.I highly recommend the Norton Critical Edition which contains 150 pages of commentary including some of Dostoevsky's own notes and critiques by Russians of the same time period.

I was also annoyed with Sonya because she was so... I don't want to say weak because it takes strength to do all the things she did, but she cried too much and that sort of thing. I was also disappointed that Razumikhin disappears halfway through the novel. He was my favorite character, but of course, he disappears. Once Sonya showed up, Razumikhin was pushed into the background. T.T I also realized how much of a jerk Raskolnikov is, especially in that one scene with Sonya! I still like him, though. He's probably my second favorite character.I think that even though a lot of the characters' actions were unrealistic, their thought processes were realistic, at least for people in their positions. In any case, whether realistic or not, I like the way Dostoevsky writes his characters. I guess insane people is just his style. ...... I like it! XDI thought this novel was pretty intense, funny, and deep, as it touches upon many of the issues that Dostoevsky explores throughout his works.Certainly The Brothers Karamazov is a lot more intense and philosophical, but I don't think people give this book enough credit.

"1043",1042,"Sachin Sharda","A very slow read, it took a while for the book to get going, but sometimes this is necessary for characters to develop and form a great story, and this is exactly what crime and punishment is. It explores whether suffering legitimises the act of sin and whether its possible its possible to seek redemption through suffering. The ending was satisfying for me and I loved the book. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. "
"1044",1043,"Janna","Crime and Punishment is an interesting look into the psyche of a killer. I have read it a couple of times and it is a very haunting book. Dostoevsky really takes me to those dark streets in Russia and the images he creates are still vivid in my imagination."

"1046",1045,"VaultOfBooks","By Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Grade: A+If there is any author that can be spoken in the same breath with Shakespeare, Goethe, Dante then it has to be the name of Fyodor Dostoyevsky, one of the finest authors Russia has produced, right in the ranks of Leo Tolstoy, if not higher. However, like most Russian authors, Fyodor’s characters are outlandish, over the top, proud, egoistic and at the same time perverted. However, this perversion, is meant in an intellectual sense, more like a corruption of thought.Fyodor Dostoyevsky is a master of psyche, and every line uttered in his novel reverberates and changes the entire psyche of the character. Crime and Punishment was originally published in parts in a magazine, it was later compiled and published as a novel. The period from 1866-1881 saw the creation of Dostoevsky’s greatest works: Crime and Punishment (1866) The Idiot (1868) The Possessed (1872) The Brothers Karamazov (1880). Though a very engaging novel, truth be told, it pales in comparison to The Brothers Karamzov, a study of human psyche, and the master’s magnus opus. His prison experiences, as well as his life after prison among the urban poor of Russia, would provide a vivid backdrop for much of his later work. Released from his imprisonment and service by 1858, he began a fourteen-year period of furious writing, in which he published many significant texts. Among these are: The House of the Dead (1862), Notes From The Underground (1864), Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1868), and Devils (1871). It feels strange to review this great author, as I may more than must have failed to understand the meanings of his words and the layers he adds in the novel.“Life is in ourselves and not in the external,” writes Fyodor Dostoevsky in a letter to his brother dated December 22, 1849.“To be a human being among human beings, and remain one forever, no matter what misfortunes befall, not to become depressed, and not to falter–this is what life is, herein lies its task.” (The Brothers Karamazov)First I must begin with describing some key features of this novel, the dialogues are long, by long I mean they run into pages, so it is really difficult to catch and cling to the train of thought, then the thoughts interloping the conversations are sometimes confusing, but the real difficulty is in understanding Russian names.So here is how you go about the last problem, which is the only problem that cannot be solved via avid reading, the Russian convention is to refer to someone by their first name and a middle name based on their father’s first name. You take the father’s first name and if you’re male, you add –vich and if you’re female, you add –ovna. Razumihin (bear with me on the spelling…it changes from book to book because of the Cyrillic alphabet translations) has the first name Dmitri and his father’s name was Prokofiev, thus he’s “Dmitri Prokovich” in polite company.Rodion and Eudoxia’s father was called Roman; their mother’s father was called Alexander. Peter Luzhin’s (Looshin) father was also called Peter, so he’s Peter Petrovich in polite company. As for the sister’s names, her real name is “Eudoxia/Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikov”. Dounia/Dunya is a nickname for “Avdotya/Eudoxia”, and “Dounetchka” is another one. In Russian, anything that ends with -ya or -ka is a diminutive. For example “vodka” means “little water”. So the family calls the sister Dunya and the main character Rodya at home. Source for most of the information above is from Yahoo answers. Keeping this in mind we are raring to go.Give me a moment to recollect myself and explain to you in the sanest way possible, about what the book is really about. The book is many things, it is about thought, crime, suffering, Christianity, perversion, love, hate, madness, solitude, and an inexplicable dread that resides in our hearts, the dread that we too, after all may not be as special as we assume ourselves to be. The protagonist, Raskolnikov is a depressed university dropout who lives in his gloomy little room, in St. Petersburg, Russia, and rarely does anything else but think, and sleep, he sometimes goes on days without eating, in his solitude, strange ideas come in his mind allied with childhood fears and dreams, and in this deranged state, Raskolnikov decides to test his boundaries. Then what follows is a detailed psychological study of crime, its consequences and the suffering one endures to compensate for it. The story explains all this and much more with the help of a plethora of characters, such as his sister Dounia, friend, Razumihim and other unpronouncable character. The crux is the internal struggle the character faces and his need for redemption and feeling at peace again.Another thing the author takes note of, is how physical appearances are usually terribly deceptive, the best people in the book turn out to be the ones that we find physically repelling. The book also studies why people do what they do, when they know what is the right thing to do. There are varius scenes and depictions of morbid violence and such tension that it may leave you feeling mentally deranged as these scenes are so powerfully depicted. Also important are the metaphors and the symbology used in the book. You may never get it, I might be hardly getting it completely, but respect this 527 page critique on human nature.Originally reviewed at: www.the-vault.co.cc"

I never read the Constance Garnett translation (it's been on my shelves for almost 40 years) so I can't offer a comparison. There is an immediacy and humanity in this book that is hard to explain. As I read Raskolnikov became more and more real and I actually started liking the rascal. I've always considered D the greatest of novelists ever since I read Brothers in my twenties. But this is now my favorite of his novels.Despite the depth of the philosophical underpinnings of the character development, the plot was endlessly inventive and unpredictable. The first half is more difficult as much of the action is internalized. But once the central murder occurs the plot starts moving rapidly (for Dostoyevsky anyway)."

"1053",1052,"Tempo de Ler","Trágica e emocional, Crime e Castigo é uma obra excecional em vários aspetos, como seja a profundidade psicológica do enredo, a ponderação crítica do mesmo e a complexidade individual das personagens intervenientes. Neste livro, Dostoiévski deixa-nos um extraordinário e profundo estudo da natureza humana, aliado a ponderações filosóficas, religiosas e políticas. O crime é cometido quando o protagonista, Roskolnikov, assassina uma velha penhorista com o objetivo de lhe roubar dinheiro/pertences e também a irmã desta, que acaba por testemunhar involuntariamente o homicídio. O castigo surge logo depois sob a forma de culpa, remorso e medo.Psicologicamente torturado, Roskolnikov passa a viver num turbilhão de emoções, alternando entre euforia e pânico, alegria e depressão, amargura e alívio - drama que Dostoiévski descreve de modo extraordinário! A passo com o desassossego emocional, acompanhamos de perto as motivações de Roskolnikov, a sua atitude niilista e aparente confusão moral. Apesar de o jovem estudante viver na pobreza, este não foi o único fundamento para o malefício cometido; Roskolnikov divide as pessoas em dois grupos: as ordinárias e as extraordinárias. Colocando-se a si próprio no último grupo, Roskolnikov vê-se acima das regras da sociedade, intelectualmente superior e capaz de feitos importantes - não necessariamente éticos - sem sofrer por eles danos ou remorsos. Além de tudo isto, não considera o homicídio um ato condenável se a vítima não for um membro ""útil"" da sociedade; pelo contrário, encara a morte da agiota como um acontecimento benigno.Roskolnikov irá - à medida que mente e corpo se corrompem em irracionalidades - que não está realmente no grupo dos extraordinários e a redenção chegará através do seu amor por Sónia, personagem de verdadeira devoção familiar e religiosa, cujo sacrifício (e ""crime"") tem como objetivo beneficiar os outros e nunca a própria.

Ainda estou sem palavras para definir o sentimento que me dominou e me domina ainda agora, após o término da leitura. Toda o enredo é fantástico, todos os personagens perfeitamente construídos! O desenvolvimento da trama após o assassinato da velha usurária e sua irmã Lizavieta cometido por Raskólnikov é incrível demais, toda a construção psicológica dele, assim como os estados de delírios e febres, são tão frenéticos que eu passava quatro horas lendo sem perceber.

Não existe autor melhor para criar personagens perturbados e nesse quesito Raskolnikóv talvez seja o mais. Não é um personagem pelo qual tenha empatia mas é impressionante como Dostô nos faz penetrar na sua mente conturbada e doente e nos faz sentir asfixia naquele ambiente claustrofóbico em que ele vive.

"1065",1064,"Zack","Raskolnikov är en före detta juriststudent i St. Petersburg med en syn på livet att det finns två sorts människor; en sort som måste lyda de moraliska lagarna medan den andra står över dem. I en artikel beskriver han hur denna sorts människor nästan har en ursäkt att begå brott eftersom de endast borstar av sig efteråt och går vidare. Raskolnikov är också i behov av pengar; för att fortsätta sin juristutbildning men också för att betala det sunkiga lilla rum han hyr. Efter ett besök hos en lokal pantlånerska får han en idé. Hur skulle det vara om han tillhörde den andra sortens människor? De oåtkomliga. Skulle det inte då vara en sorts tjänst från honom till samhället att mörda pantlånerskan Aljona Ivanova och därmed även få tag på de pengar som han behöver? Efter att ha upplevt att han fått hintar och bevis för att ödet vill att hans idé ska bli verklighet; ger han sig iväg för att mörda Ivanova i hennes lägenhet. Men han inser snart att han inte tillhör den högre klassen av människor trots allt – något som leder in honom i ett febrig vansinne. Dostojevskijs böcker brukar ofta vara på listor som ”100 böcker du måste läsa innan du dör” men har även beskrivs som en sådan där klassiker som få faktiskt orkar läsa. Brott och straff ligger på någon sorts underbar plats mellan de två. I början fann jag språket rätt trist och byråkratisk men med tanke på flertalet hundra sidor i boken så hann jag även fatta tycke för det. Det är så där lagom dramatiskt och löjligt. Men Dostojevskij är även en hejare på att beskriva människor och deras psyken. Möjligtvis är hans karaktärer lite för teatraliska för min smak men de är trots det komplexa och intressanta att studera – vilket är perfekt för en bok som detta. Jag har läst lite recensioner och dylikt sedan jag blev klar för att försöka få en så bred uppfattning av boken som möjligt; och i en av recensionerna resonerade skribenten att brottet är Raskolnikovs livssyn och straffet är själva brottet han begick. Det är en bra beskrivning av denna bok som sammanfattar en intressant bok som utforskar det mänskliga psyket. Trots att det ibland kändes segt att läsa boken så är den värd sin status som en klassiker – men även en bok jag skulle rekommendera att sätta på sin ”100 böcker jag måste läsa innan jag dör” lista på grund av studeringen av Raskolnikovs psyke före, medan och efter mordet.

But more simply, I have to say, I LOVED it. The imagery, the plot, the character development, the tone, the...whatever. How could this Russian dude from the 19th century know what kind of story I would find fascinating? But, even with that I could easily see someone lamenting some pretty improbable plot developments, and sometimes the coincidences are a little too glaring. But it just doesn't bother me. -  Although his habit of using Jewishness as an attribute of despicable people sure did break the magic spell. And I guess being German also means that person is inherently bad. Interesting how he can be obsessed with his individual characters finding a fundamental meaning of life but not recognize the absurdity discounting some ""individuals"" because of race or nationality I can also imagine people identifying literary devices and themes and such, like maybe Marmaledov's drunk talk with Raskolnikov at the beginning foreshadows something or other, or perhaps he blurts out the overall theme of the book in a few short sentences. Maybe, but I just don't want to pull together any such argument. I just want to exist in that thick, emotional world of these characters. They are consumed by deep issues of meaning. But meaning at such a core level it makes you cry. 600 pages of searching for answers on what LIFE is. And even the superficial people go at that with all their being.However I guess I should at least remind my self of possible topics, and some quotes I might want use for a book report if I ever how to repeat High School.Accept Suffering and be redeemed by itAccept lifeLife itself defies logicRazumakin (damn I wish this guy was my friend!)Talking nonsense is the sole privilege mankind possesses over the other organisms.

This was one of the first books I read because I knew it was a classic, but otherwise knew nothing about.It was intense.So much so, that I HAD to talk about it as I worked my way through it. I told my mom about it from the beginning, and every day I was busting at the seams to tell her about the latest chapter. I honestly could not believe what I was reading: the story is graphic and brutal in parts, and yet also dangerously personal. I could see behind the eyes of the protagonist like some kind of out-of-body experience, as if my soul had helplessly merged with his. It was a little bit like The Picture of Dorian Gray as i literally sat frozen with guilty horror at what seemed to be a reflection of myself. It was intense.And also amazing. It really did change me: it added a layer of depth and understanding to my naive teen awareness. It was monumental. I remember feeling the palpable change from the experience, like my whole interpretation ofthe world was now profoundly dimensional. There was clarity-- an awakening of my adulthood, perhaps, that sharpened all of my senses. The memory of that insight is tangible to me even now.

The cat-and-mouse game between Raskolnikov and Porfiry Petrovich is utterly fascinating. And who can resist the ""hooker with a heart of gold"" theme?"

In Taxi Driver especially Travis Bickle shares Raskolnikov's perverse rationalization for murdering, that it will benefit society at large, and there are even some undercurrents of Iris, the underage prostitute Bickle sets out to save, in Sonja, the pitiful, dirt poor prostitute that Raskonlikov finds solace with in Crime and Punishment. Scorsese however, takes a decidedly more subjective approach to the material, allowing the viewer to sympathize with Bickle as he takes us through his warped mindstate, and ending on an ambiguous note that eliminates the 'punishment' aspect entirely. Bresson, on the other hand, seems to share Dostoyevsky's overall theme of faithlessness resulting in purposelessness. The agony of Bresson's petty thief and Raskolnikov are shared in the fact that both men lead lives without meaning, and their acting out against society only deepens their spiritual wounds.- Raskolnikov is a surprisingly relatable character for contemporary readers. Of course, I can't sympathize with his poverty and the sheer misery of his surroundings, and I've never murdered anyone myself and don't plan on doing so, but it is revealed that he is a former student who dropped out of school because he let his books collect dust while he sat in his room doing nothing. Anyone who has ever put off studying or avoided schoolwork entirely can sympathize here! - Unlike Pickpocket and Taxi Driver, which perhaps are limited by their artform (not in a negative way though), Crime and Punishment is a much more comprehensive survey of poverty, misery, loneliness, insanity, and crime, highlighting several characters who fall victim to their surroundings, including one deranged mother whose street performance is one of the most jaw dropping scenes in the book, instead of just one. - As scholarly and dense as I'm making this novel sound, it is actually really readable. Dostoyevsky's prose is eloquent but never overly dense. The only hurdle a reader might face are the long winded dialogues that are occasionally delivered, one character in particular is really annoying with his self absorbed blabber. - The dynamic between Raskolnikov and Zametov, the police detective on his case, is easily the most compelling thing in the book, at least from a plot perspective. Above I noted that the long winded dialogues can sometimes be tedious- when Zametov is delivering them to Raskolnikov, however, they are anything but, and the reader will hinge off of every word the man speaks, searching for a crack in his well-meaning facade that would reveal his true intentions of prosecuting Raskolnikov. This was a masterstroke by Dostoyevsky in creating suspense. - Even besides these adrenaline fueled scenes, Dostoyevsky creates a lot of tension off a simple premise. Raskolnikov has done a bad thing, now he must pay for it- but will he? Or is he paying for it the entire time, through his paranoia of actually being caught? His psychical sickness articulates pretty well how much of a 'real' toll this inner guilt is taking on him. - This might be my new all time favorite novel. So much depth beyond what I barely touched on here. "
"1086",1085,"Konstantin Boyanzhu","A wonderfully written novel by Dostoyevsky. In Crime and Punishment, you are able to enter the mind and psychology of a killer, and better understand his motives, his reactions toward the killing, and his fear towards being caught by detectives. "
"1087",1086,"Sergio","Primeira incursão em Dostoiévski: uma excelente história, personagens fortes e uma aprofundada e vincada exploração dos meandros da alma e dos sentimentos do homem, em especial da culpa e da loucura."
"1088",1087,"Zahra","AMAZING!!!!! But beyond my expectations.. It's the kind of book that would get you interested from what's beneath the words. I enjoyed every single detail in the book, and it is really amazing how Dostoyevsky actually gets the reader into this condition whereby he/she enjoys every part of the book by experiencing different emotions. I personally, enjoyed all the feelings I went through while reading this book, the torment, the tense, the happiness, the pity, the astonishment, the surprises and whatever's left from emotions in this book. One other thing I LOVED about the book, is how Dostoyevsky went deep inside Raskolnikov's self, and other characters. When Raskolnikov, the main character, commits the murder of the old pawnbroker lady and her sister, Dostoyevsky describes in a perfect way his feelings along with the physical description of his condition in such position. After the part of how Raskolnikov commits this crime, the other parts of the novel may not sound really interesting, but trust me they ARE! As I thought for an instant that because the murder happened in the very first part of the novel, it would be boring later on, for what would come up in the next 5 parts of this novel. But as they say, ""Don't judge a book by its cover"". "
"1089",1088,"Nâv Choudhary","Undoubtedly, one of the most famous and influential novels in world literature. Redemption through suffering. The more we intellectualize, the more imprisoned we become.“Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart.”"
"1090",1089,"Jessica peyton","I have read this book several times. It is one of my all time favorites. The beginning is hard to consume, but once you continue with the book it is amazing. The end message is very biblical. I could say much more but I don't want to give anything away. Wonderful read!!!!"
"1091",1090,"Enid","Este libro me cambió la vida... me abrió el cerebro y me hizo pensar que hay miles de emociones por experimentar en la vida."
"1092",1091,"Cleopatra1074","Possibly my favorite read of all time! It made me feel like I was living and walking the streets of st. petersburg at that time. The intense psychological drama made me feel I was living in this guys skin."
"1093",1092,"Mara","Is it wierd that I loved this as a teenager and read it twice? "
"1094",1093,"Scott Vanzandt","In this case the tension is moral rather than physical. It's a murder mystery of sorts, but one where we see (and FEEL) the crime being committed: Dostoevsky puts you inside Raskolnikov's mind before, during, and after the double murder at the center of the plot. In this case the problem that drives the story isn't whether the police will catch the killer -- although the novel features a clever and persistent detective worthy of the best of the genre -- but whether the killer can be brought to a point where he has the moral courage to confess. I stole the above from another review, but it is on the money.Again, this was one of those that I always knew I should read, but hadn't."
"1095",1094,"Khaled","In this splendid book, Fyodor Dostoyevski takes us to a new horizon of understanding the psychology of the crime. Rodion Raskolnikov, an early twenties law student, was pushed to commit a crime due to his poverty and social problems. He finds later the most humane characteristics through suffering. In general, this book reconciles the relationship between the material world and the spiritual one. "
"1096",1095,"Reuben","My favorite book of all time."
"1097",1096,"Mark","Given FD's ""paid-by-the-page"" reputation of being hopelessly wordy and digressive, I thought this was pretty taut and focused. Although the central drama of the plot involves the resolution of a moral thought experiment (""do the laws of right and wrong only apply to those too weak to transcend them?"") the pleasure of the book is not in finding vindication of one's ethical convictions but rather in the experience of the protagonist as he navigates his place among his various relations and tries to evade capture, from both the police and his own psychology."
"1098",1097,"Elizabeth Crisci","Probably my favorite book of all time. The character development is really wonderful and despite the book being quite long and the Russians being known for being a little dry, I find that every time I pick this book up I end up finishing it in a few days because I am unable to put it down. The story is beautiful and really moving and explores a darker side we all grapple with.Also I find the Barnes and Noble translation to be pretty decent, they are usually okay with making translations more ""for the people"" although my all-time favorite version of the book is Princess Alexandria's translation. I recommend this one the most highly. It was really pretty."
"1099",1098,"Rachel Sullivan","This novel, unprecedented before its publication in its subject matter, provides a window into the mind of a murderer. As the readers learn, it is not fury, revenge, or insanity that causes Raskolnikov to commit his crime. Nor is it because of his theory that some men are born with the innate right and responsibility to kill, and by doing so, change the world. No, Raskolnikov's crime is, I believe, committed due to the hopelessness of the world he lives in and the loneliness in his own heart. After the murder is committed (in the first section out of six in the book), Raskolnikov spends the rest of the novel desperately attempting to avoid confrontation and discovery, but these attempts are futile. The ending of the book leaves us with a feeling of overwhelming relief, yet, even as we condemn Raskolnikov's actions as detestable no matter what the reason for his crime, we simultaneously cannot help but empathize with his feelings of self-loathing, depression, and hopelessness. This book allows us to see not the deranged mind of a heartless killer, but the proverbial mind of all of humanity; irrational, passionate, flawed, and powerful. "
"1100",1099,"Ellen","Two works, in all the literature I've read, really drove home what it would be like to commit murder and then feel the utter alienation that follows. One, of course, is this book, and the other is a drama: Shakespeare's under-rated play, Macbeth.Both works did and still produce chills. Zero at the bone..."

"1104",1103,"Meg","Classic. Another surprisingly easy and absorbing read. I was very intimidated initially by Russian literature, especially by Anna Karenina and War and Peace. But this book was accessible and understandable."
"1105",1104,"Riju Sarkar","""Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.""Honestly, I don't know how it is humanly possible to write such a book.Let's begin by acknowledging that this isn't an easy read. The language isn't especially tough, but it takes time to get used to the dialogue - which often consists of long monologues and narrations within narrations, and confusing pronouns. Also, the Russian names! Almost every character (and there are lots of characters) is referred to by multiple names, some of which I can't even pronounce!But hey, the best things in life never come easy. When you get past these minor hurdles, Crime and Punishment is a treasure chest. Of suffering.The book has many themes - the foremost of which deals with the psychology of crime and the effects it produces on the criminal. The overall plot is rather simple but has many fascinating subplots and nuances attached to it. The story continues in a slow pace with a strong focus on philosophy and character interactions.Crime and Punishment outshines all other books that I've read in one aspect: characterization. The characters are painfully complex and exquisite. Dostoevsky sets things up such that multiple (and often conflicting) traits are squeezed out of every character and the reader is presented with fictional beings of amazing depth and variety. Seriously, I can't praise the characters enough.I would recommend this book to everyone who is willing to cross the mentioned hurdles. Crime and Punishment will not disappoint those who are patient with it. On the contrary, it'll create a permanent and profound mark.P.S. One of my friends gave it up midway because he found it to be too dramatic. Well, I would concede that no one actually talks or acts like the the people do in the novel. But this is literature (old literature). You simply cannot expect it to be completely like real life. Actually, I feel it is better than reality.A person kneels before a frail, young girl who has been forced to sell her body to support her family - he kisses her toe (which frightens her), and then proceeds to explain himself: ""I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity.""That's not drama. That's art."
"1106",1105,"Chella","I'd say this is Dostoyevsky's finest moment because it's so readable. I expected a plodding, worthy Russian tome, but got a thrilling page turner. A great introduction to Dostoyevsky and one of my favourite books ever because it surprised me. Deeply philosophical without being esoteric, literary and gripping. A must read. "
"1107",1106,"Amalie ","What can I say about Crime and Punishment? Well NOT READING IT would be a capital Crime! :) Dostoyevsky's genius lies in his ability to create simultaneously a psychological novel and a novel of ideas. Though each character represents a certain philosophy of life, they never become lifeless or stereotyped. Dostoyevsky's genius is in this ability to combine the perfect counterpoint between conflict of personality and conflict of philosophy between his fascinating characters. He also specializes in stealing the reader's interest and sympathy for the most unlikely characters, like the protagonist, Raskolnikov. As always, it's difficult to do a complete review of Russian classics (or any other lengthy piece of classics). There are so many layers and much more to talk about and it's a time consuming process. So a group readings always help to get the full experience with the feedback from other readers, even when I re-read, such as this one.If anyone's interested to understand the novel in many levels check out the group discussion on ""Crime and Punishment"" at ""Discovering Russian Literature"" http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4..."

"1115",1114,"Dionysus","It is interesting that I happened to read Crime and Punishment at this particular time in my life. I found peculiar similarities between my own circumstances and those of the main character, Raskolnikov. 23 years old, former university student, struggling to find his bearings in life, uncertain future prospects, always seeking out isolation, preoccupied by his own thoughts and fantasies. Although my own thoughts and fantasies are not as mad or immoral as those of Raskolnikov, nor are my financial circumstances so dire, the juxtaposition of our parallel lives made me think. Dostoyevsky's reputation as a master of the subtleties and profundities of the human condition cannot be better elaborated by me than it already has been by others. Suffice it to say, Dostoyevsky's brilliance is on full display in Crime and Punishment, and it is justly considered to be one of his greatest works, as well as one of the greatest works of world literature. It is a crime thriller, a moving story of sin and redemption, a philosophical exploration of an individual's attempt, in the belief of his own superiority, to impose his will on the ""raw material"" of humanity and its eventual defeat by total selflessness and compassion. "
"1116",1115,"Seth Johnson","This is a life-changer. It's difficult to read, without a doubt--one of the few books I've read with the literal power to alter my mood in a fundamental way. I was a terrible, depressed, unapproachable and morose person from page one through page 1,479 (or whatever) (sorry, family). But the payoff is tremendous. I've read many a ""tale of redemption"" book, but this one puts all others to shame."
"1117",1116,"Ajla","This is my second time reading it (although it took me quite a long time to read a full book), and again I'm being very impressed. Dostoyevsky created a true masterpiece which everybody has to read (and I'll judge you if you never ever want to read it). "
"1118",1117,"Jose Salome","This is a masterpiece! Learned more psychology from here than from textbooks :)"
"1119",1118,"Irwan","Painfully brilliant! A thorough dissection of a murder and its murderer, complete with a good rendering of the time and the place in which the story takes place. Dostoyevsky took me on a ride to experience what states of mind before, during and after a crime. Such a complex states beyond the typical cliché expressed in the crime novels. I learn that there is no black and white. It is always a mix. And a character is prompted with decisions along the way that leads to the realities he/she has to endure. I have to remind myself that this crime and this criminal is Raskolnikov, who has been rendered with his past, his desires, his inspirations, and his dreams. Then he is fronted with a situation and react according the rendition of character he has been given. That is one of the masterful aspect of Dostoyevksy's authorship. What I mean here is that, another character with different characteristical renditions would possibly end up with a completely different story. I am relating this to the recent debate about the concept of prison and crime following the violent riot in one Indonesian prison. I was intrigued by how should a prison is approached and managed with the intention of handling criminals. This story gives insights of how a crime came to be in certain circumstances, and then how should this be punished? What about the other crimes and criminals? How can there be a general system of punishments for such special crimes and criminals?Those questions are definitely not to be answered in this place. But I just want to show how a good literature can illuminate a certain aspect of human life. "
"1120",1119,"Dave Dufresne","Hard to rank any book 5 stars, but I can't imagine a better one. Classic style, amazing skill - Dostoyevsky brings you right into the mind of a murderer. And by the end of the book, I found myself really rooting for the guy. Interesting - how far away are we from becoming the same? The power of the mind... well worth the time, but certainly not a weekend read! "
"1121",1120,"Zenith","Hard book to read but a MUST read. Definitely one of the greatest classics books of all time. Morality and wisdom. Fyodor Dostoyevski is one great author."
"1122",1121,"Danica Colnarić","The book is remarkable. It is very difficult, you feel sympathy for a murderer, but he killed an evil creature. All the way along the novel, you think he would not make it, that suicide is looming, but when you reach the end and see that there is hope and that life goes on if you have someone to stand by you no matter what, that is the real catharsis. This novel is the proof that a real masterpiece does not necessarily have to end tragically."
"1123",1122,"Habiba Bashir","It's Dostoyevsky...What more can I possibly say? A true piece of art and my all time favorite novel! Dostoyevsky depicts an in-depth understanding of the psychological aspect of a human being and emphasizes the dualistic forces and contradictions existing in human mentality...it is simply mind-blowing! "
"1124",1123,"Eli McLean","This was a re-read, and it reinforced, and all the more enjoyably, just how brilliant a writer Dostoevsky is. Reading this at a more mature and sensible age really evoked Dostoevsky's philosophical musings more, and overall it was a poetic and powerful reminder of the influence and genius of Russian literature. "
"1125",1124,"David Marciniak","This book was tedious, dark, brooding and painful. I loved it. It explored so many aspects of human nature. The characters were tragic, yet so alive. It came down to this: what persists? What is real? What can one truly believe? I think the answer Dostoyevsky provides is complex and yet altogether simplistic. I am sorry I have finished it. "
"1126",1125,"Anna Tatelman","Fascinating look into the mind of a criminal, the world of mid-19th century Russia, and the way in which our lives connect. I never expected to like this book nearly as much as I did. I'll admit that at times it seemed a bit long, and I would have dearly appreciated a few more paragraph breaks, but all in all it was a fabulous read throughout, including one of the best endings to a novel I've ever read. "
"1127",1126,"Yvette","Sin duda un libro espectacular y digno de leer. Es un clásico! En primer lugar, Fyodor Dostoyevski me impresiono como escritor. En esta obra al menos me parece que tiene un talento para ahondar en la psicologia y el alma del ser humano.Al principio me pareció un poco lenta, y quizás el idioma-traduccion fue un pequeño obstáculo (hubo algunos problemas de traducción, errores ortográficos y redacción, pero de eso hablare en breve). Básicamente, la historia se desenvuelve en una época difícil: La Rusia de los Zares. Una epoca en donde la sociedad esta en crisis y a punto de sucumbir. El personaje principal de la historia es Rodion Raskolnikov, un estudiante que vive en la miseria que decide cometer un crimen para comprobar una teoria: algunos seres extraordinarios en la sociedad se les ""permite"" moralmente cometer un crimen si este es un mal para la sociedad. Después del crimen es cuando la historia se vuelve interesante. Nos pone en perspectiva esa delgada linea entre lo ético, lo moral, lo legal y la justicia. Rodion comienza a experimentar una culpa que lo corroe por dentro, que aunque no fue apresado, vivía en paranoia, se sentía enjaulado en su propia culpa. Aunado a Rodion, hay otros personajes cruciales en la historia, y he aquí lo fantástico que muchas historias no logran cumplir: cada uno de estos personajes tiene densidad y profundidad, cada uno es diferente, cada uno nos da referencia de diferentes aspectos de aquella época ya mencionada en Rusia- llena de injusticias, desigualdad, pobreza (no tan diferente al mundo actual en ciertos países?). Desde el inicio, Rodion, como personaje te atrapa, y considero que hasta ahora es uno de los personajes complejos, impresionantes, intensos, humanos y conmovedores que me ha tocado leer. Otro personaje entrañable para mi fue Sonia. Sonia es la persona que transforma a Rodion, y al menos a mi parecer, lo que proyecta su personaje es como el amor puede regenerarnos, puede hacernos capaces de transformarnos. Y precisamente por que ella también sufre, (su miseria la lleva a optar por la prostitución para hacerse cargo de su madrastra y hermanitos), es el dolor que los une y los ""purifica"" por así decirlo.La familia de Rodion y su mejor amigo Razumijn también aportan sentimientos a esta historia. Sobretodo su hermana Dunia, que representa la virtud y la bondad, y su amigo la generosidad y la esperanza. Inclusive personajes secundarios como Porfirio (la justicia, la etica) y Schvalitov (la avaricia, la ambición), Mermeladof (vicio), enriquecen el mensaje que nos da Fyodor con esta majestuosa obra literaria. Una obra que al menos a mi, me produjo sentimientos encontrados de desazón, tristeza, alegría, odio, y amor. El final, fue sublime e inteligente, cargado de esperanza, de perseverancia y amor incondicional.Puntos negativos, son pocos. El libro puede por ciertos momentos parecer muy denso. Sobretodo puede parecer un poco difícil de interpretar para aquellas personas no familiarizadas con los clásicos (este libro fue escrito en el siglo 19). También el uso de diminutivos y usos de apellidos patriarcas en el idioma ruso puede confundirnos. Por ejemplo, la hermana se llama Avdotia pero también el autor se refiere a ella como Dunia o Dunetchka (tchka al final de los nombres es ITO/ITA en español, es una forma de llamar a alguien cariñosamente). A lo largo de la trama, a veces el autor llama por el apellido patriarcal a un personaje y otras veces por el apellido normal. Es parte del idioma y cultura rusa y no es algo negativo per se, pero puede confundir. Otro punto negativo es que al menos mi edición tenia errores ortográficos (no muchos), errores creo que de redacción (tal vez es difícil traducir un clásico del idioma ruso al español). Sobre todo al final, encontré errores como Mar1A por ejemplo. Me llevo esta historia en mi corazón y recomiendo este libro ampliamente para tenerlo en la sección de clásicos permanentes. Me gustaría leer pronto otra novela de Fyodor Dostoyevski, y creo que será Los Hermanos Karamazov. Otro clásico con excelentes ratings. Para todos aquellos que no conozcan de antemano un poco de la biografía de Fyodor Dostoyevski, les recomiendo hacer una búsqueda simple, ya que nos proporciona un poco de profundidad cuando leemos sus novelas. Yo al menos lo leí de wikipedia http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiódor_D..."
"1128",1127,"Corey","One of the greatest novels I've ever read. At times so intense it was a bad idea to read it before bed because it would get my heart racing. It's one of those classics that is absolutely relevant to this day, and just as gripping as a modern psychological thriller. Recommended for all mature readers. "
"1129",1128,"Lacolz","Les digo lo que dijo Dostoievski que dijo Rilke sobre Rusia: ""Rusia: el país donde los hombres son seres solitarios, donde cada cual lleva un mundo en sí, donde cada cual está lleno de tinieblas como un monte, donde cada cual es profundo en su humildad... seres humanos llenos de lejanía, inseguridad y esperanza, seres humanos en trance de estar haciéndose. Y por encima de todos un Dios al que no se determina jamás, que constantemente se está transformando y creciendo"". De eso va la novela. Por eso Dostoievski utiliza de epígrafe a Rilke. Por eso yo retomo la epígrafe de la novela. Porque de eso va la novela."

"1131",1130,"SANTIAGO","This story, next to Alexandre Dumas, Count of Monte cristo is my all time favorite. Very profound and fydor paints an awesome picture when he writes, feels as if you are there."
"1132",1131,"Cass","I have been practicing saying ""Fyodor Dostoyevsky"" so it rolls off my tongue making me sound very cultured. I told my friend I had just finished reading ""Crime and Punishment"", she asked if it was by Jane Austen (in her defense I read Jane Austen twice a year, and she had kids jumping all over her as I told her about the book). I said ""No, it's by Fyodor Dostoyesvky"" and then felt quite smug that I managed to get the name out without tripping over any syllables!! It helped that I listened to the audio book (I have an audio book on the go, I listen to them in bed while I settle my children, or while I am doing the ironing, or sewing, or baking because the book got so good I listened every chance I got). About a third of the way through I transferred a copy to my husband's phone so he could listen on the way to work, I was blown away by the book and needed him to listen so that I could discuss it with him.The rest of this review will probably contain some spoilers, but it won't spoil the book, this book is about the writing and the pyschological insite, rather than simply the plot.The first part of the book left me rather shaken. The main character did something rather heinous, but during the whole lead up to the act it was as if he wasn't going to do it, I mean he was thinking about how he didn't think he would do it, how he couldn't believe that he was considering doing it, that it was a funny thought that he might to it. He didn't seem particularly evil and yet it murdered a woman in cold blood. I was shaken. I sat there thinking about how his actions seemed so innocent to himself, up until he commited the murder. I thought about all the times I had fleeting thoughts of doing a heinous thing ie driving a car off a bridge or one of those scary thoughts that occasional pops into your head and makes you think ""what the fuck I don't want a thought like that"". Yet here is this guy having those thoughts and slowing making plans to actually commit the act all the while not actually believing that he has an intention of going through with it. I finish the first part of the book and wondered if I do would be capable of murder. I mean this guy murdered, how was he any different to me? (Thankfully by the end o the book I could see how different we were, what a relief).I needed my husband to read the book so I could talk to him about how exasperating Raskolnikov, the main character, was. Basically he kills a woman for money, extensibly so he can set himself up with a good education and fulfill his destiny. Yet up until this act he had given up university and spent his days laying miserably on the couch. His mother and sister where scraping every penny together and sending it to him, but he would waste it or give it away and just continue to be depressed and doing nothing.His friend is the contrast, his friend works hard doing this and that scrapping money together in order to finish university. He even offers a job to Raskolnikov who refuses it, thinking to himself that it is too little money and not worth the effort. Money is continually coming to Raskolnikov and we start to see that if he had only got off his ass then he could have made enough money to pay his own way through university... this shit me off.The book ended with Raskolnikov realising that he loved the girl that had followed him (I won't give away who she is). But this is what I hate, at the moment that he realises that he loves her he realises that she is not good enough for him. He has an ephinany about life and her and awakes from his depression ready to begin life anew, but he looks at this woman who has been looking after him and helping him, and ponders how she isn't good enough for him because she hasn't had the same ephinany that he just had. I though ""Fuck you Raskolnikov, she didn't need the ephinany because she was already living it!!"". I mean Raskolnikov is an asshole and won't talk to anybody or be friendly. Yet the girl is friends with everybody, everybody likes her, she is alive and he isn't. So when he misses her, realises that he loves her, and is suddenly awakened and alive again... he looks at her and thinks she isn't smart enough, blah blah blah.I loved how the book highlighted all sorts of crimes and awful people and we got to see how and why we considered one act a crime and yet another wasn't. Why did we, the reader, accept the murder of the old woman, yet it was the murder of the young woman that horrified us that most. Why did we cheer for Doonya as she pointed the gun at her attacker etc.I love Russian doorstoppers, I didn't realise how much until I finished this book. Two of the most amazing books I have read are Russian doorstoppers (Anna Karenina and Crime and Punishment), I am of to start reading Crime and Punishment now."
"1133",1132,"Jimmy Recinos","Once again Dostoevsky manages to flood my consciousness into a world so palpable that I feel as if the protagonist's movements are my own. I can feel the streets, the cramped rooms, and the stench of every last one of the airs he describes...There is much more to be said, but for now, I can only express my gratitude for the genius achievement that is Crime and Punishment."
"1134",1133,"Nicoletta","io credo che questo sia uno di quei testi che devono far necessariamente parte della biblioteca di ogni singola personaseppur lungo, la trama è ricca di colpi di scena e a mio parere mai noiosa come invece molti definiscono la scrittura di Fyodor.la maggior parte della trama si basa sui pensieri del nostro protagonista e su quello che lui considera giusto o sbagliato nei suoi modi d'agire"

"1136",1135,"Harpal","This book is awesome. The protagonist, Raskolnikov, is crazy like a fox. The weird thing is that, despite how bizarrely wayward and even evil some of his thoughts are, I think a lot of readers are intrigued by them and by him in general. Man, it's hard not to be - repulsed and luridly fascinated at the same time. Wow. Not sure I've ever quite read a book like it. This stuff is intense!Just a heads up - read the whole thing. There's an epilogue or something at the end that really puts a twist on Raskolnikov. I almost skipped it and persuaded myself to read it at about 2 am the night before a test on it the next day in English class. Phew, did I dodge a bullet on that one!"
"1137",1136,"Sandra'njohn Griffith","This book really grabbed me. It is a little dark because the main character really pulls you into his dark world. It shows how the evil-one can make you feel you are doing the right thing, but as soon as you do it, he jumps on your back and tells you how bad you are."
"1138",1137,"Andrés","Una obra maestra de la literatura universal."
"1139",1138,"Raul Duarte","Dejando al lado la dificultad de los nombres y de recordarlos (que para nada es una falla) es una de las obras más sencillas de leer de Dostoyevsky y tiene tantas cosas para analizar, es una novela algo larga, pero para nada se siente pesada, lo mejor en todo en mi opinión es la gran cantidad de personajes, y lo bien escritos que están todos. Recomiendo leerla si:+Te gusta Dostoyevsky o la literatura rusa.+Los clásicos.+Personajes atormentados.+Tramas complicadas."

"1141",1140,"Gilang Permana","Ini adalah buku pertama dari Dostoyevsky yang saya baca dan langsung jatuh cinta dengan penulis yang merupakan kompatriot Tolstoy, konon Notes From Underground juga layak untuk disimak. "
"1142",1141,"Jamie","Heartbreaking it is true. Dostoyevsky captures the human soul in its lingering shame and beauty. He is sensitve to the duality of nature and mastered the art of social interactions. The reader begins to question their own view of what tragedy means and how the world encompases it through the totality of chaos."
"1143",1142,"NG","من أجمل ما قرأت في حياتي كلها."
"1144",1143,"Sabah","Dostoyevsky taught me a salutary lesson, how pride and vain distinction of oneself, fatal arrogances in themselves, can propel one to take the irrevocable path which leads, terrifyingly, to an alienation from society. As such, a warped self belief, of that ideology, instills delusions of superior exemption from it socially, morally and lawfully.A detailed review to follow in the new year."
"1145",1144,"Jarrod","This is my favorite book of all time. The detail here in the social setting is exquisite. The twisting and turning of the plot is extravagant. The author goes through pain-staking detail of getting you into the main character's head to the point where you feel his anguish and pain. You know by the end of the book what will happen. The conclusion is quite telegraphed, but you are so gripped by the character's emotion that you want to keep reading and don't want the story to end. By the conclusion it is easy to see that Raskolnikov has redeemed himself and has been relieved of his sins."
"1146",1145,"Pastor Ben","I read this as a 10th grader and now again as a 37 year old. I enjoyed it then, but mainly, I suspect, because it was a challenge. I enjoyed it this time because I was able to see beyond the basic plot to some of the ideas and how Dostoevsky works with the characters to express them. Big takeaway: self-justification is a kind of slow motion suicide. But how does one get free from it? From suffering and from undeserved love."
"1147",1146,"Lydia Chew","Sometimes, I feel like I give classics 5 stars just because they're classics; it's like they've stood the test of time so they deserve it. Honestly though, Crime and Punishment was different. Reading the foreward, you would have expected Fyodor Dostoyevsky to have been Sigmund Freud - all the references to the ""duality"" of a person's nature, the psychoanalysis of the crime - all of it seemed so insightful. But like most classics, I don't feel the full force of the ""message,"" the ""greater"" that makes it a classic. But the story is very touching and realistic, in that it throws you into the messy situation and makes you feel the anxiety and madness of Raskolnikov. I can't get over Svidrigailov and Sonia. He's just like Andrei in We the Living; her faith in humanity is incredible."
"1148",1147,"Jeshu","To be honest, this is the first book I read from a Russian author. I've always felt intimidated by them, and I was utterly scared of starting reading some of their works, and not being able to finish them. Even my dad told me that Russian writers were very difficult to read.Beginning the book was hard. It took me a whole month just to finish the first part of Crime and Punishment (and I was reading it in Spanish, I'm not that brave to read it in English... yet). After that, it took me another month to read the rest of the book. After the crime was committed, it was just page after page after page after page. I couldn't stop reading it, and if it took me so long to get to the end, it was mainly because university has kept me busy. As I read, I could feel Raskolnikov's anguish and anxiety. I really felt desperate! The only complain I have with the book is that I read two different editions. the first one was borrowed from the university library, which I couldn't borrow again because I lost my card. So I kept reading it in my Sony Reader... and the names where different. The first book had the names adapted to the Spanish pronunciation, while the ebook edition didn't, and it took me a while to figure out who was who.Apart from that, it's an awesome book !"
"1149",1148,"Sabrina","To my surprise, I ended up enjoying Crime and Punishment. It's a great book. The ideas are its greatest attributes. Raskolnikov's beliefs about greatness and society, rationalization of murder, and ensuing insanity are fascinating to read."

Very few books have had such a profound effect on me. Very few books can draw a person in so completely, make one think so deeply, and so perfectly do justice in its portrayal of pain, suffering, guilt, anxiety, and injustice inescapable in the human experience. In a broader sense, this book is a tome of human experience itself. I may not be skilled in literary criticism, but it doesn't take a college degree to realize the power of this masterpiece. If you've never read this book, then I ask you to do yourself a favor and pick yourself up a copy."

"1155",1154,"Antoine","I didn't agree with Dostoevsky's philosophy at all. The notion of purging oneself of sin through suffering or pain strikes me as antiquated. Still, the conveyance of emotion throughout the novel was brilliant. I was gripped with anxiety or fear at points where it was apparent that these are what Raskolnykov (forgive my spelling) was meant to feel. The worry and questioning that the protagonists had for his own actions seemed to perfectly reflect how someone who's just done something horrible and is having second thoughts would think. This is one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. "

At first I found the Russian names difficult to follow, but soon I came to know all the characters by their many names. I loved the in-depth perspective into the mind of the protagonist, where the reader almost comes to reason with the protagonist despite his crime. The book succeeded in providing us with a psychological perspective into the mind of a criminal. "

"1161",1160,"Joanna","Just finished this last night. When I began, I'd just finished Lord of the Flies and started wondering what I was doing to my inner-child. I'm wondering what those who have also read The Lord of the Flies think of Crime and Punishment. For me, the latter treads fearlessly into the darker side of humanity as well as the former, but evolves and concludes in a way which left the reader with a satisfying sense of hope and redemption. I'd sincerely welcome comments from those who have read BOTH books, as well as anyone who has also read only Crime and Punishment. As you can see, I give this book 5 stars, because it carried me through a broader spectrum of insight, emotions and I feel more ""whole"" for having read it."
"1162",1161,"Louise Hislop","Took me an age to get through this one...you can't stop and start too much without having to go back and reorientate yourself in the story. However it's a fantastic in-depth study on the human condition, and Dostoyevsky was so far ahead in his political analysis and commentary on what was evolving in Russia at the time. He applies the new emerging theories - in particular utilitarianism - to a single individual and the decisions he makes, and follows him through the emotional and moral turmoil that ensues as a result. It's insinuated that what works for government is not necessarily the best for the individual."

Forty years later I'm glad I returned to it, especially around the occasion of visiting Dostoevsky's apartment and some locations from the novel.

"1166",1165,"Melisa Blankenship","Wow! This book follows a man who wonders whether an important person can kill an unimportant person without guilt or consequence. He follows through seeing himself as someone who matters more than others and who can therefore decide who doesn't matter as much. He kills an oppressive woman who lends money and will probably not be suspected or caught. Most of the book follows his spiral into near insanity from the guilt of his actions. For Hitchcock fans this shares the basic plot of Rope and for Woody Allen fans, Crimes and Misdemeanors, but with different moral conclusions for each."
"1167",1166,"Louise","I loved this book. I thought that I would have to make a big effort to read it but found it very readable.

What can I say that hasn't been said before?That aside, I really enjoyed this book. A question that runs through the book - Does the ends justify the means? Is violence an ethical means for change? This is still a relevant question. Dostoevsky does not seem to offer a solid answer to this question, but instead makes arguments for and against the idea of the end justifying the means. All in all, it's a great literary exploration on the question.Another common theme within the book that I really enjoyed was the reoccurring theme of the scapegoat. Dostoevsky deals with the rights of silenced groups, especially women and sex workers.Anyway, it was a great read, and I'd definitely recommend it. c:"

Tiene que ser realmente buena, porque Raskolnikov (el protagonista) me cae como una patada: es un egoísta con delirios de grandeza ridículos que trata fatal a las mujeres que se preocupan por él. Pero esto, que tantas veces me hecha para atrás en una novela, aquí no me importa lo más mínimo. Y es que además está Dunia, que es un personaje con carácter maravilloso, y Svidrigailov, que es un villano cínico y sarcástico pero con matices, probablemente mi villano favorito. "
"1179",1178,"Anjanette V","dostoevsky brings you into the mind and heart of a troubled former student, raskolnikov, suffering poverty and confused by the philosophy of his time. operating under a theory he devises that allows him to view the murder of a crooked old widow as merely a matter of the extraordinary elevating themselves, this psychological thriller will captivate you. i almost felt like i had killed alyona, like i stood blundering and unable to think in her room, shuffling through her things. his guilt, mine, overcame him (and me) in the most excruciating ways. although written in 1866, it doesn't feel a bit out-dated, and despite criticism that the ending is trite, it's well worth the plot and sub-plots that run throughout. you'll realize that the punishment part of 'crime and punishment' wasn't referring to the protagonist's eventual sentence in Siberia. (it also doubles as an excellent critique of social ills, with feminist and class issues made clear.) did i mention that dostoevsky was amazing(!!) and talented?"
"1180",1179,"Andrew Smith","One of the most timeless, brilliant books I've ever read. Although it was addressing a very current issue of its time, raised by the emergence of Socialism in Europe, the questions Raskolnikov asks haven't gone away. Are there fixed moral bearings in the human world, or is everything relative, with history being written by the victors? And can perpetrating an evil to benefit the greater good ever be justified? A brilliant story, with layer upon layer of depth, and still strikingly modern-seeming...what's not to love?"

"1184",1183,"Laila","This book is easy to read inspite of the fact that it is over 500 pages. The reason for this is that Dostoevsky is an extremely good writer. But the best part is how well he describes the characters. You KNOW and understand the main character as if he is your brother or son. Dostoevsky describes him so well and in such facinating detail that you know the reason why he chooses to do anything and everything. The murderer becomes a very empathetic character and you understand WHY he murders.For me, a lover of character in novels, I fell in love with this book for the amazing characters and how the author understoods his characters so beautifully. Most amazing is that the author writes beautifully about his characters and their psychology a good 20 or 30 years before Freud came up with his theories.Such sensitivity, such lovely writing, this book is a definite Good Read."

"1190",1189,"Dylan Farrell","Dostevsky’s novel did not only consist of an extremely intriguing storyline and plot, but also brought up thought provoking questions regarding the basic issue of morality. In the beginning of the novel, we are introduced to a poor and somewhat manic Rodya Raskolnikov who is simply struggling with existence. We soon become aware of his enormous intellect, but also have knowledge of his strange thoughts and meditations upon the subject of murder (we become more familiar with his thoughts on this subject when introduced to his published theory on the subject). Also in the first section, I was extremely impressed with the intense and vivid descriptions that Dostevsky uses to build up the supporting characters and their personalities. The characters who we meet not only are present in the beginning, but play extremely important roles throughout the story as a whole. As the book progresses, we witness Raskolnikov’s murder and the subsequent internal and external struggles that he faces. The attempt to discover a “way out” came to no avail, since the inevitable capture occurred. While the ending was one that left the audience with hope for improvement in the life of Sonia and Raskolnikov, upon reading the last word, there were many issues that I reflected upon. The morality of committing a crime, which certainly was a talking point throughout, was something that I was left thinking about. While murder or any crime for that matter is not commendable, the arguments that Raskolnikov made that stated some great men were able to overstep laws and morals for the betterment of society was certainly intriguing if nothing else. Many times throughout I was left pondering upon the points made, which made for an enjoyably stimulating read. "
"1191",1190,"Fernando","lol, okay, well I'll offer my opinion..as yet its embryonic in its process, so excuse me if it sounds muddled, but what redemptive qualities are their in a man who offers himself up for punishment to redeem himself in the eyes of someone he loves, rather than for coming to realisation of his deed himself. Rask, returns to face his punishment upon seeing Sonia's horror, as such that itself leaves me questioning his sincerity."
"1192",1191,"Mike Gannon"," One of the all time best books ever written, of course I could say that of any of Dostoyevsky's books. There were scenes in this book where my heart was pounding and I could barley breathe. Nietzsche wrote about the concept of humanity moving ""beyond good and evil"", to break the shackles of morality and do whatever we must to evolve into the ubermensch (supermen). Well Dostoyevsky played with these ideas first. The main character is seized by ideas like this, that there is no God (all things become permissible), that some form of socialism will make everything fair and the supposed rationalism that would see humanity as an equation. So without God there is no right or wrong, we shape the world and with socialism we shape society so when you believe this you say so what if people get killed in my revolution in the end it will be justified by getting the world we want. It's the ""ends justify the means"" thinking, no longer ""restrained"" by traditional morality like ""thou shall not kill"". So the protagonist Raskolnikov believes these ideas, they were all over Russia and Europe at the time, but he questions what would it take to implement this. He asks himself if he has what it takes to be the type of man (what he calls a Napoleon)that can kill for his ideals. Or is he just another weakling restrained by Christianity and morals that he and many no longer believe in. Can he move ""beyond good and evil""? I'll stop there so as not to give away spoilers but I've only laid out the intellectual premise, the rest is a gripping novel about the crime he commits and the guilt and paranoia afterward with the police hot on his trail, that's where all the heart stopping scenes come in. Oh by the way if the ideas of the main character seem far fetched to you, then don't forget that all of Russia was taken over by this line of thinking and the communists killed millions! Dostoyevsky is nothing short of a prophet."

"1194",1193,"Joey Warner","The world has seemed to set itself up perfectly for Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov to commit murder: economic poverty, political oppression, and a hinted-at mental/emotional debility of the young man. The immediate impetus (i.e. an overheard conversation in a bar) to kill a particular woman set Raskolnikov's mind spinning plans, and on the day he was to carry them out, even the string of circumstances seemed too perfect for his barbaric act not to be destiny. It was if the day had been made for him to shed the blood of the lecherous, ""tiny, dried-up old crone,"" Alyona Ivanovna.The psychological repercussions of the young, former student's act are overwhelming, his family and friends alienated, as he sinks deeper into himself and the psychical agony over what he has done. The attentive reader will ask herself how much of this is really Raskolnikov's fault. Is the agent of the murder to blame completely, partially, or perhaps not at all? Is 19th-century Russia the true murderer, and Raskolnikov cognitively pulled under by the devastating tide of his circumstances?It makes sense that Dostoevsky's work would remind me of Clarin's masterpiece _La Regenta_, as they were both written around the same time. Had I not known the dates of composition of either work, one would still have called to mind the other. Fyodor Dostoevsky, similarly to Leopoldo Alas (i.e. Clarin), seems to act as a scientific god, creating his characters in his world, setting the top spinning, and stepping back as the impartial observer._Crime and Punishment_ is a joy to read for its complexity and nearly unparalleled masterful writing, even in translation (by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky). Yet, every so often, I have felt compelled to lay the book to rest for days at a time. At times, as I hover over Raskolnikov's world apace with the narrator, it is like watching a set of fine crystal teetering at the edge of a shelf, as if to fall and shatter at any second. That said, this work goes highly recommended to those who enjoy writing that often acts as a rubber band being drawn back indefinitely.I have not as yet finished this book."
"1195",1194,"Megan McInnis","Relentless. Not only my favorite by Dostoevsky but also my favorite classic, and one of my favorite novels altogether.

"1196",1195,"Leandro","I was a 17 years old teenager when I read this book. After 12 years, what can I say about Raskholnikov´s saga? Every line of this masterpiece is full of feelings, thoughts, life; every minute that I spent reading it brings me the best of my young reflections. Maybe my personality would be quite another if I didn´t have read Crime and Punshiment."
"1197",1196,"Diogo Ogawa","One of the best books I've ever read!I had never felt so out of breath because of a book, the author really made me curious and interested to know what would happen. Some dialogues beats the bush and make you anxious to know where they are going.The characters are pretty unique and interesting, Raskolnikov reminded me of Holden Caulfield (Catcher in the Rye) with his crazy and rebellious mind, a really powerful guy. The Russian names are a bit difficult to remember and they get you confused sometimes but don't affect that much.The idea of the book is very reasonable and you start thinking in different perspective about ethics and justice. Really cleaver book!"
"1198",1197,"Diogo","Os estados psicológicos são objectos dimensionais quantificáveis. Razkolnikov não se sabia ainda mover por entre os seus objectos psicológicos, foi apenas isso o que o conduziu à Sibéria.

The characters were like threads in a tapestry, everything went together and worked well. The lauguge was mild, there was very little vilence. I mean the guy murders someone, but it's over fairly quick.There is a character who is a prostitute. But the book is very good at implying what she does without saying it from a long while. And this goes on throughout. The prostitution is implyed but never shown. Clean in that respect.The way the author dealed with capturing the human mind was amazing. I am eager to read his other novels and to re-read Crime and Punishment soon."

"1207",1206,"Shanmugam","Whether you like it or not, Rodion Romanovich’s soul in turmoil is shoved through your throat now and then, that is if you experiment with a bit of books and movies. So, it is inevitable that you want to face the real Rodion yourself. I took my own time though. Dostoyevsky works have been a mixed bag to me. ‘Poor People’ was a revelation, I was smitten by the style of that book for at least 10 years. Then, read ’The Gambler’ from Project Gutenberg, liked it till what I read. And, naturally became a self proclaimed advocate for Dostoyevsky in my circle.A few years ago, attempted his magnum opus, doorstopper of a book, ‘The Brothers Karamazov’. Maybe it was that bad reading phase I was going through, I stopped after 1/4th of the book. So, I was a bit apprehensive to start ‘Crime and Punishment’. Enough of a backstory I guess.I am not capable of saying anything new about this masterpiece. Of course, it is a masterpiece. Effect of ‘Confused Ideology’, it hits you like a heavy blow. 150 years. Russia has come through a revolution, biggest historical change of recent centuries, the world has seen off a couple of world wars. The tortured soul, the one Dostoyevsky portrays, is still relevant. Don’t mislead by the notion of certain people that Doestoyevsky’s characters are one dimensional, they are far from being one, this novel has a multitude of characters which go to the path of salvation in different ways. If you are not moved with later part of the book, it might only mean that you are more cynical than me :) You coast along the pages like as if you were in a roller coaster dream.This novel is not without its shortfalls either. You could smell the plot 20 pages ahead, no we are not Fyodor Dostoyevsky, it is just that we have seen similar things umpteen times. Let us not even talk about the-hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold, who does Mary Magdalene here. But, we don’t read classics, especially a Dostoyevsky, just for the plot, do we?"

"1209",1208,"Bilguun Jargalsaikhan","According to what I think, this book is one of the best example why it's important to read novels. The point behind why is because we get chance to understand more about different situations, that happens or happened in somewhere in this world, we have never experienced or some of them which we even could relate to and thus understand how people dealt with them. In other words, understanding human psychology in various situations. Novels of this type always leaves us with something to speculate about."
"1210",1209,"Matt Carton","An amazing book. Though it did not move me nearly as much as The Brothers Karamazov, I love how Dostoevsky is able to find beauty in that which is ugly. "
"1211",1210,"Jenny Suh","When it especially comes to the arts, can the Russians do anything wrong? I don't think so. I hate to over-generalize, but I think it's true: Russian writers=awesome writers.Picking a favorite Russian novel is like picking your favorite piece of dark chocolate from an assortment of equally succulent chocolates. This one, though, is one of my favorite books of all time. Masterful storytelling, great character development, and good, meaty, philosophical stuff. Has this been made into a movie? I don't know. If not, what in the world is going on? Yes, it's that good.Obviously, this is not a short novel. So, here's my quick take on it: You have a man, driven by his own ego, committing some atrocity. You can probably guess, and even if I were to state it, it wouldn't necessarily be a spoiler. Dostoevsky places this pivotal scene in the beginning of the novel to serve as a catalyst for the rest of the 300+ pages of the novel. He is a sadistic author, torturing the main character with an internal conflict that starts to eat away at him. Raskolnikov (the main character)turns out to not be such a callous individual after all as his guilt ruins his mind and makes him dysfunctional in life. Ultimately, he realizes that his twisted theory does not apply to him, and he slowly transforms and starts undergoing the process of redemption. So, in short, a story of redemption. There are a lot of those out there, aren't there? Redemption is a long and complex process, but take a novel that tries to capture that process and does it eloquently--it makes a great story. And...it's inspiring. "

"1215",1214,"Sierra Abrams","Ex-student Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov has a theory, and one that will change more than one life forever. He believes, with great conviction, that a genius has the moral right to commit murder, theft, and other crimes – just because he is intellectually “above” others. He believes this so thoroughly that he, believing himself something of a genius, murders a pawnbroker and her sister with an axe and steals the money they have accrued over the years. Just managing to escape, Raskolnikov sinks into a war with his conscience and a delerium that causes others to doubt him. After meeting a drunkard named Semion Marmeladov, Raskolnikov has bouts of generosity and conviction, helping their family with their debts, and then paying for Marmeladov’s funeral when he is crushed by a wagon, all the while trying to justify his moral degradation. Then he meets Sonia, Marmeladov’s oldest daughter, a young woman who has turned to prostitution to keep her family from sinking further into hunger and destitution. Raskolnikov befriends her, fascinated by the oxymoron she has created: a poor prostitute, sunk so low, who believes in the saving grace of Jesus Christ. In the end it is this, and his own raging conscience that bring him to justice.This is my second Dostoevsky novel, and I cannot say how much I enjoyed it. I don’t even know where to start, I have so much to say – there’s so much to mention, to bring to the table. However, I think I’ll start Dostoevsky’s incredible (almost super human) ability to create characters.Having read Dostoevsky before, I knew I was going to enjoy the characters. The characters in The Idiot stuck with me for a long time. In fact, as I write this, I can very clearly picture each character, what he/she was intended for in the story, and their personalities that are so impressioned into my mind. It is the same with Crime and Punishment. Raskolnikov’s character alone is a masterpiece. His strange thought processes, his convictions, his awareness of all going on around him, his dilerium after he murders Lizaveta, and the new convictions that come about because of it all make up who he is and where he’s going. As I started the book I wasn’t as taken with him as I was Prince Myshkin in The Idiot, but as the story progressed and he changed, I felt a great attachment to him. While Myshkin was on the more talkative side, Raskolnikov was quiet, one who observes and reflects rather than speaks his mind. I felt sorrow for Raskolnikov because of the choices he made, but I loved him all the same as he tried his hardest to come to grips with the horrors of what he had done. Sonia’s character is the more simple type, and a hard one to read about. After becoming a child prostitute at her step-mother’s insistence, Sonia hates her life but continues living that way because her family needs the money. However, her simple and wonderful faith in Jesus Christ as a wretched sinner affects Raskolnikov in ways he cannot foresee at the time. Other characters in this story include Porfiry Petrovich, the police inspector, who, one word at a time, tries to squeeze the truth from Raskolnikov; Peter Petrovich, the fiance of Raskolnikov’s sister Dunia; Marmeladov, Sonia’s father; the mad Katerina Ivanovna, Marmeladov’s wife; and Razmukhin, Raskolnikov’s closest friend who wants to help and has a very innocent love for Dunia.Dostoevsky’s writing is the next aspect that just gets me, in every way: his sentence structure, the way he describes scenes and objects, how he introduces characters…the purity of it all should be recognized for as long as books are in print. I felt this way about The Idiot and I feel it now. Dostoevsky’s writing makes you feel as though you’re reading a dream. If you’ve ever wondered what a dream would be like if you could read it, I’m convinced this is it. It’s perfectly smooth, like you’re floating; and yet his topics are real, his characters are lively and relatable, and above all his stories pierce you deeply with their symbolism and their cunning. If only every author used a bit of Dostoevsky’s methods in their works… If only the stories spoke of real and often dreadful things but still permeated with the kind of hope and love we see here, this world would cease to exist as we know it.

"1217",1216,"Moses","If you have only read this book once,you may remember it being ""deep"" or ""dark"".The second time around it is still both of those things,but I think that it becomes a bit lighter, and a funnier read.Dostoyevsky never fails at making his heroes so right, even attheir cruelest. A man that can consider the act of murder so lightly, should also consider suicide (so) lightly. And he does this. I also believe that only Dostoyevsky can warm someone up to these feelings. He makes the reader a comfortable human being.Or have you not thought of these things for yourself?Own it, and read it forever."

This book would quite easily be perfect for debating in a book club, if all the members could spare 25 or so hours of heavy reading time. "
"1219",1218,"Fil","Consigliato proprio a chiunque: alla fine scriverò un elenco per provare a convincere anche te, sì, proprio te, che hai paura del mostro sacro Dostoevskij e non osi toccarlo.La vera recensione dura una riga: ""Questo è un capolavoro, uno tra i libri che bisogna assolutamente leggere."" Non ho intenzione di parlare dei personaggi e delle tematiche. Non mi ritengo neanche all'altezza di qualche accenno. Questo libro si avvicina parecchio alla parola ""perfezione"".L'unico punto ""brutto"" del libro e' la parola Epilogo: penso che solo un libro su cento mi abbia davvero fatto male lasciarlo.Sarebbe bello creare una listopia ""addii dolorosi"", ma dubito che molti sarebbero sinceri. Chi non ha mai provato questo ""dolore"" probabilmente inserirebbe i suoi venti libri preferiti. Anch'io mi sarei comportato così fino a qualche anno fa. Questo ""dolore"" e' un'altra cosa; penso che alle persone fortunate (o sfortunate a seconda dei punti di vista) capitra al massimo una decina di volte nella vita. (Io raggiungo quota tre).Alla parola Epilogo ho deciso di ricominciare da capo, leggendo prima tutti i commenti degli esperti. L'ho trovato persino più bello. Le chiavi di lettura sono molteplici e tutti sembrano aver ragione. Questo romanzo contiene veramente ""tanto"".Alcuni libri penso che li rileggero' dopo decine e decine di anni (per esempio Anna Karenina). Per questo romanzo non bisogna aspettare. Secondo me va riletto immediatamente per notare le sfumare e le possibili interpretazioni.Molto bella la prefazione di Serena Prina all'edizione Mondadori.(Basta scaricare l'estratto gratuito del kindle per leggerla.) Un consiglio: non leggete prima le varie ""prefazioni"". Forse aiutano a capire meglio alcune cose, ma contengono troppi spoiler. Sembra quasi che la trama sia l'elemento meno importante e si possa raccontare tranquillamente tutta la storia. Secondo me la ""tensione emotiva"" provocata da una prima lettura va lasciata libera al cento per cento. Per qualche giorno non credo che leggero' altro. Voglio rileggermi alcuni passaggi per una terza volta...---------------------EDIT: non sto proprio leggendo nient'altro. Odio Dostoevskij! Devo continuare a scrivere.In questo romanzo è molto forte la componente psicologica, quindi proverò a fare da ""psicologo motivatore"" per convincere ""gli intimiditi"" (come Jessica, Monikav, Jul, ... ) che non bisogna avere paura di Dostoevskij.Ecco un elenco di ragioni.- Questo ""finto mattone"" ha stranamente alcune caratteristiche comuni ai più avvincenti thriller moderni, come  Gone girl. La sfida psicologica tra due ""avversari"" e' molto intrigante. Avete paura di leggere un thriller moderno e temete la tensione degli interrogatori?- Nonostante il falso luogo comune ""Dostoevskij illeggibile"", ha uno stile scorrevole (ovviamente non come Grisham o Connelly) e si legge con facilità. Tra i famosi 1001 libri da leggere, sono presenti almeni 100 libri con uno stile più complesso: anche alcuni libri recenti, per esempio  Il senso di Smilla per la neve, sono decisamente meno scorrevoli. Avete paura dei luoghi comuni e dei coccodrilli nelle fogne di New York?- Leggendo questo romanzi potete studiare psicologia: vengono descritti sogni, paranoie, attacchi di panico, ossessioni, manie di grandezza, fantasmi, ricordi dell'infanzia, ...Non volete risparmiare i soldi d'un manuale di psicologia?- La prima esperienza con i russi e' indimenticanile. I nomi russi fanno ""letteralmente"" impazzire. Come si fa a non confondere Rodja Rodka Rodiòn Romànovič Raskòl’nikov e Ramuzichin? Volete privarvi di un bell'aneddoto da raccontare ai vostri nipotini? ""Quello volta che ho scagliato un libro fuori dalla finestra perché continuavo a confondere i nomi...""- E' un libro da leggere punto. Leggere per poter dire agli altri ""l'ho letto"" non è mai un buon motivo, però in questo caso se serve a togliere le paure...Non volete farvi belli con i vostri amici?Queste sono solo scemate per convincere i timorosi che non è un libro impossibile. La bellezza del libro e' da tutt'altra parte. Ho evitato qualsiasi spoiler, qualsiasi citazioni e qualsiasi accenno agli indimenticabili personaggi per non rovinare minimamente un capolavoro.Se siete esperti dostoeskiani vi consiglio la discussione su goodreads (club russo) su tutta la sua bibliografia.Per gli altri riscrivo il mio consiglioLeggetelo senza informarvi su niente, poi scoprite i vari ""segreti"" del romanzo, leggendo prefazione ed interpretazioni, e rileggetelo.L 'etichetta ""libro da leggere"" secondo me è assurda. Nessun libro e' da leggere se non si ha voglia. Se invece non leggete per paura, devo essere severo: fatevela passare e leggetelo."
"1220",1219,"Melusina","A book of very rare depth, portraying the dual nature of the human condition in one single character, Raskolnikov: compassion, irrationality, logical thinking, hubris, cruelty, sophomoric, in self-denial, egoistic yet altruistic, suffering yet reborn. Life cannot be lived in theory. One can choose to look at the book with modern, social democratic, Western and even atheist eyes, but the core of the story remains the same. We are all Raskolnikov and struggle with the same Faustian demons within ourselves. If life were only rational, we would not be human. "

"1230",1229,"Joshua","‘This is a fantastic, gloomy business, a modern case, an incident of to-day when the heart of man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood 'renews,' when comfort is preached as the aim of life. Here we have bookish dreams, a heart unhinged by theories.’ - Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Crime and Punishment It’s always nice to find out what a book is about in a simple phrase, line, or sentence within the book you’re reading. Dostoyevsky was kind enough to do this during a conversation with Porfiry Petrovitch and Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov, an otherwise good man, was unhinged by the theories of nihilism and utilitarianism, and like Don Quixote, with ‘so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind.’ Except, with Raskolnikov it seems to be so little eating and so much thinking. He explains later that before we meet him, he had spent most of his time lying on his couch--eating or not with equal apathy, depending on if anyone remembered to bring him food--and thinking, thinking over his theories. This is a cautionary tale--though I balk at the idea of calling it a 'cautionary tale--about what can happen when a man, utterly alone, gives thought to perverse theories. Thomas Mann said about a man who lives too much by himself: ‘Images and observations which could easily be disposed of by a glance, a smile, an exchange of opinion, will occupy him unbearably, sink deeply into the silence, become full of meaning, become life, adventure, emotion. Loneliness ripens the eccentric, the daringly and estrangingly beautiful, the poetic. But loneliness also ripens the perverse, the disproportionate, the absurd, and the illicit.’ There is a touch of the absurd in Raskolnikov’s theory--to an outsider, of course. It seems that utilitarianism is the main ideology Raskolnikov is building his theory upon. Killing one old woman who no one cares for and who no one will miss so that he can use her money to further his education and go on to help people makes a strange bit of sense if taken in the light of “the most good for the most people;” however, I have a hard time seeing anyone but an unhinged mind seeing anything in it besides its theoretical application. But, of course, Raskolnikov’s is an unhinged mind. Along with utilitarianism, the another ideology Dostoyevsky is attacking is nihiilism. Nihilism almost sounds like a joke to me, thanks to all the ridiculous teenage trends that have adopted Nietzsche as their patron saint (more often than not, having never read anything by him), but nihilism in 1860’s Russian was no laughing matter. Though Raskolnikov never refers to himself as a nihilist, one can easily see many of the aspects of existential nihilism in his theory, along with the utilitarianism above mentioned. Raskolnikov act as a reductio ad absurdum against these, and other, ideologies that Doestoyevsky says are a plague infecting modern society. The concept of dangerous ideologies seems to be a common theme for Doestoyevsky, based on the three novels I’ve read by him and the ones I know a few things about. So far, each book I’ve read could hold the forewarning: ‘Here we have bookish dreams, a heart unhinged by theories.’ Of course, Notes from Underground has been called the prelude to Crime and Punishment, but even in The Double, I’ve noticed a common theme of the lonely, thoughtful man. Perhaps it’s just the books I’ve read by him (I’d be reading more if I owned any more), but it’s a theme I find very interesting. When it comes to being undone by a flawed theory, there are really only two ways: only go over it with yourself or have it backed by your peers. Dostoyevsky chooses to analyse the former. If Raskolnikov had talked over his theory with, say, Razumikhin, I’m sure he would’ve ended, rather than following through, by laughing it off as a fanciful idea. He did say that he discussed it with his landlady’s daughter, who he was engaged to, but after she died, it only rolled around in his head. Like Raskolnikov, I don’t have a lot of people to talk with about philosophy or what-have-you, but I have noticed that often times I’ll come up with some theory or idea that sounds good until I read a book with a conflicting notion. In other words, it’s always good to have your views challenged. I think that was Raskolnikov’s downfall: he didn’t have his theory challenged until after he put it into action. Though I must say, one thing I really enjoyed about this book was that for a novel about flawed thinking and transgression, there’s no preaching or moralizing. There’s hardly even sentimentality, though it sneaks in at the last second. One could argue that there’s a little bit of moralizing in the Epilogue, and I’ll concede to that argument if anyone wants to make it. Still, Doestoyevsky isn’t here to tell you how to think. He gives voice to people, often conflicting voices, and often conflicting voices from the same character. There’s a realism in that that’s refreshing. Often novelists use characters as symbols in this type of book, but Dostoyevsky’s characters feel more human and less stand-ins for ideas. There’s quite a bit in this book, and I’ve been trying to write this for over a week now, so I won’t try to go any further. I do plan to reread this, in the Volokhonsky/Pevear translation, and I’m thinking about writing up a comparison to another novel that kept coming to mind while reading this--Great Expectations. But I’ll save that for later."
"1231",1230,"Gwen","If one is to read Crime and Punishment, one must read the translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. I am only one fourth of the way into the book, but I'm impressed by how Dostoevsky has the reader feeling empathy for one of the main characters, a murderer. This book forces the reader to look beyond the punishment into economics, a main force behind his need to kill."

He considers the murder a service to the people but realizes he has taken a life of another human being, but he never really admits to the remorse in the novel . It seems like Dostoyevsky wanted to create somewhat absolute character and his conscience seems to lie in Sonia (a prostitute) , a woman he ends up loving more than anything in the world and would repent for her . He is not a underdog whom you would root for but you can definitely end up having sympathy for him as he goes through a treacherous painful journey which affects his sister Dounia and mother and put them through hell . He might not show his love for his family and his friend Razuhumin , but he loves them a great deal and even though he might not repent for his sins completely but he gains appreciation for people he once jeered and angered at ; and envisions a better future with less Napoleanic grandeur but more love ."
"1233",1232,"Bonnie","There was a time in my life when I couldn’t get enough of reading Dostoevsky. Maybe because his books made me think so deeply about being human and how we choose to live our lives. I began with Crime and Punishment, probably the work he is best known for. What I remember is being fascinated by Dostoevsky’s brilliant understanding of human nature. I remember thinking what a deep study this book was; an incredible examination of a man who commits murder and how he is “punished” for it. I remember thinking that here was a master storyteller. Not only able to create complex characters, but able to take the reader deeply inside a character’s mind. Best of all, I remember that I would stop reading periodically and think; not a mindless read, but an absorbing one. "

"1235",1234,"Sivan","It's been about a decade and I still remember this book so vividly. The character is so well-drawn that you become paranoid while reading, almost as if you had committed the crime. I remember an acquaintance comparing himself to Raskolnikov in my yearbook. If you haven't yet read this classic, you should. There is a reason it has stood the test of time. "

"1237",1236,"Darrell","Crime and Punishmentpresents its readers with a mystery. Why did Raskolnikov kill the old pawn broker woman? Several explanations are offered. He's poor and he needed the money. He was temporarily insane. The Devil made him do it. Raskolnikov's mind is certainly muddled. On the one hand, he thinks killing her is actually a moral act in an ultra-utilitarian sort of way. Because she is an evil person who beats her sister and cheats her customers, the world would be a better place without her. Raskolnikov could then use the money she hoards to help the poor. He thinks he'd be saving dozens of lives by taking just one.Additionally, he thinks of himself as the next Napoleon. When you kill one person, you're a murderer, but if you kill thousands you're a national hero. Rules, he reasons, are made for the commoners. Great men are above the law. This line of reasoning no doubt inspired the creation of Nietzsche's superman.Raskolnikov also sees himself as a pawn of fate. He happens to learn that the pawnbroker hoards money. Then, by chance, he also learns that she'll be home alone at a certain time. He finds meaning in these coincidences and thinks it must be fate. He plans out how to kill her and goes through with it as if following a script. Other characters offer the opinion that crime is caused by the environment or a person's nature.After actually committing the deed however, he finds that his abstract ideas clash with reality. Overwhelmed with guilt, he falls ill and goes around St. Petersburg in a delirious state talking to himself and returning to the scene of the crime. He almost gets caught several times, but evades suspicion with the help of coincidence and the fact that nobody can believe he'd actually commit murder.Raskolnikov's character isn't very sympathetic. He's very irritable and treats his friends and family poorly. I found myself wanting him to get caught sooner. The psychologically talented police inspector Porfiry is a much more admirable character who seems to know Raskolnikov better than he knows himself. Dostoevsky's examination of philosophical ideas and psychological states is by no means a light read, but one well worth it."

Only you."
"1239",1238,"Fiona","This is my first Dostoevsky and I have always wanted to read a Russian author. I really quite enjoyed this and I am now keen to read more.I read it last year so this book isn't quite fresh enough on my mind to do a lengthy review. I'm not an English Literature student either so I'm not going to go into an in depth review of this book, though I would have thought it would make a very good subject for one.I did start reading this a long time ago when I was about 15 I suppose and got - not bored with it I suppose but lost patience with all the names. Now I'm a slightly more patient reader and understand a bit more about Russian name giving and that - I found it a lot easier to get along with.It is basically a rather simple sounding story: Raskolnikov, a student down on his luck - living in poverty, decides to murder a pawn broker in order to steal her riches. He plans it in the greatest detail. The story of Crime and Punishment is how Raskolnikov lives with himself afterwards.It is a deeply psychological book and the characters portrayed are so real it is almost frightening. And that is what takes a simple story of a crime committed, into a much deeper, much more complicated one."
"1240",1239,"Carlo","Quite the page turner after 200 pages or so! Some stray thoughts:* Raskolnikov's mom was the mom'est mom ever. I felt like I was reading about my own mom* It was interesting that they Raskolnikov (and Dostoyevsky) wrote about ""the extraordinary man"" in 1866, 30 years before Nietzsche wrote about the Ubermensch.* How this book managed to have a happy ending was quite a feat* I feel like (view spoiler)[Porfiry should have had received the final confession, or at least was in the room when it happened. He worked so hard for it! (hide spoiler)]* Dounia <3* Sonia <3* Razumihin <3* Pulcheria Alexandrovna <3 <3 <3"
"1241",1240,"Cyra","I thought this was quite the great translation of the original text. Crime and Punishment tells the tale of a young Russian student named Raskolnikov, who plots and executes a murder. What is interesting is the act itself is probably less than a quarter of the story; the remainder of the book focuses on Rask attempting to come to terms with his actions. There are many other characters that you will meet throughout this story, and they each represent or carry a certain philosophical idea but without becoming cartoonish caricatures. This creates an interesting pool of conflicting values that will keep you gripped til the very last page."
"1242",1241,"Andria","This is one of those books that once you finish, you are left in a state if utter confusion because you don't know what the fuck you had been doing with your life before picking up this godsend of a book.This had been on my to-read list for a long time. I finally got around to reading it after finding out it was free on the kindle (heh, I'm a cheapskate). At first, trying to get into this book was not that difficult because Dostoevsky has such a story-telling like prose, that the words seem to blend into a movie in your head. The only drawback for me, since I am not really familiar with Russian culture, was with the Russian nickname system.*NOTE to to selfRodion Romanovitch = RaskolnikovDounia = Avdotya Romanova Sonia = Sofya SemyonovnaRazumihin = Dmitry ProkofychAnd the damnable Svidrigailov is just Svidrigailov.The spelling of the Russian nicknames varies depending on the book copies. For example, Dounia has been spelled as ""Dunya"" in other translations.Nonetheless, Russian lit has turned out to be quiet surprising. I was hooked on this novel for 2 weeks. Yes, it's a little long, but each page was definitely not a waste or redundant. This isn't your kind of action, intense killing and violent kind of novel. Well, because with a suggestive title like ""Crime and Punishment"", one would assume it would cover macabre events and other such crimes. Lol, never have I been so wrong. It's more like thriller/suspense, and just the quintessence of what a true chef-d'oeuvre is. Did I mention it also throws in enough French phrases so, by the end of the novel, you and Google Translate are best friends? I hope so. A little draw back, without spoiling anything I hope, is that I found the ending a little too perfect. Like everything was meant to be in a good way. But Dostoevsky does leave us a shadow of doubt...which you'll have to read and find out for yourself! Apart from its confusing names and a little mundane events, I found the book psychologically stimulating. Not the kind of mental stimulation you'd get after doing math problems, but the ""holy fuck what is this mastermind of an author planning next"".All adjectives pertaining to Dostoevsky are well-deserved, of course.Since brevity is the soul of the wit, I will be brief: READ THIS BOOK.That is all."
"1243",1242,"Eric Larsen","This one ranks at the top of the list for Classic Books I have read. Technically, I listened to it (narrated by Anthony Heald who was fantastic as well) and if anything this format probably enhanced my experience as the book is a surprisingly long one (I own a paperback copy as well and it has deceptively small font and thin pages).In trying to make a modern story comparison, the story ""No Country for Old Men"" comes to mind. This is probably not a very good comparison on the surface but the more I think about it, the more similar they seem to me. And I will qualify that statement by adding that I have only seen the movie No Country, haven't read the book (yet).In both stories we have relatively long periods where not much action happens interrupted by sudden brutality, and the violence in these two stories is both different and similar.In Crime and Punishment, the violence and depravity going on here gives you a very real and un-sugar-coated look at what I presume life in Russia in the 1800's must have been like for a lot of people. In this way the violence kind of characterizes the society in which it takes place. There is a quote by writer Erik Larson which comes to mind, and I am going to mangle it but it goes something like ""murder is a uniquely interesting crime because it gives a more unique insight to the culture of its time and place than any other crime does."" I think it is very applicable here. Likewise in No Country, the narration from the sheriff who is pursuing the villain in that story has some really interesting things to say about violence in a modern America.Conversely, Dostoyevsky gives an incredibly believable and thorough portrayal of a medium-sized cast of characters. This makes the violence considerably more impactful on an emotional level, although this story lacks the sustained tension that No Country has with the continual pursuit and flight of the characters involved in that story.Setting aside the comparison to No Country, the story presents an interesting take on ""moral superiority"" and how killers in history are celebrated or reviled based on whether they were successful in their ultimate goals, and whether those goals are considered honorable in hindsight. This concept has a lot of inter-relation to personal pride and a person's conscience, and in this way the story has several parallels to ""Pride and Prejudice"" (another story which I have watched on film but have not read yet). But you have things like people marrying for money, and others who would sooner undertake drastic alternatives. You have characters who DO have a conscience, no matter how much they seem to act otherwise. But I digress.An interesting summary I didn't know that I set out to write is that this book makes a good hybrid story between Pride & Prejudice and No Country for Old Men. I will definitely read more Dostoeyevsky."
"1244",1243,"Ahmet Kara","Büyük keyif alarak okudum, bitmesine bildiğin üzüldüm.

Okurken roman karakterleriyle sanki karşılıklı sohbet ediyormuz gibi hissettim -- tabii ki bu Dostoyevski'nin ustalığı."
"1245",1244,"Alessandra Taiganides","Dostoyevsky questions human morality in an absolutely gripping tale so profoundly that even after hundreds of years it still has direct relevance to our society. Murderers live in every continent, country, and state. But what brings one to murder? What kind of a human can succumb to murder another? It is absolutely fascinating to think through Raskolnikov’s thoughts, and watch his moral development. Dostoyevsky makes the reader question his own ethics and previous judgments not only on murder, but on the pursuit of truth, beauty, and unchangeable wisdom. Clearly, there are many different paths to find the truth and live it. One can redeem himself after crime, through punishment, and still obtain happiness. "
"1246",1245,"Yukari Watanabe","I don't have any energy to read it now, but I loved it when I was young. "
"1247",1246,"Sylvia","I'm not sure how it is that I made it through high school and college without reading so many of the classics, but rest assured, it wasn't because I failed to complete an assignment. I guess my English and lit teachers had more eclectic tastes, because I am forever embarrassed to admit yet another title that I've not read. I am working to remedy that, however, and completing this monster novel has given me renewed confidence! Let me begin by saying how surprisingly accessible this was for me. I expected a little more difficulty given that the book is a translation, is incredibly lengthy, and that it was written nearly 150 years ago, but I found it both manageable and enjoyable. Because Rodya talks to himself, the book is rich in dialogue - a factor that always speeds reading for me. I was likewise intrigued by the constant internal struggles (emotional and mental) that plague the main character - primarily because it highlighted my own inner struggle with deciding whether or not I should sympathize with this particular protagonist. In the end, I couldn't help but do so, though with a heavy dose of pity.Without giving it away, I will say that I found the ending to be extremely satisfying. There were so many different ways this novel could have concluded (as many as there are possible directions in anyone's life), but I am grateful to Dostoevsky for choosing the one that he did. I really did love this book, and I hope to read more by Dostoevsky in the future."

"1249",1248,"Vanja Antonijevic","Dostoevsky’s ""Crime and Punishment"" and ""Notes from Underground"" are his most popular and famous works. And deservedly so. Dostoevsky’s ""Brothers Karamazov"", on the other hand, is his most critically acclaimed work- regarded by many as the best novel ever written. And deservedly so. While ""Brothers Karamazov"" is Dostoevsky’s longest, but also best, most subtle, and complex work, Crime and Punishment and ""Notes from Underground"" are shorter, easier to read, and more entertaining. This is not to put down the other two books. I place ""Brothers Karamazov"" above the other two only because it is arguably the best book ever written, and only the best of many of Dostoevsky’s masterpieces. Crime and Punishment is another masterpiece and a great book. As mentioned, Crime and Punishment may be Dostoevsky's most readable and entertaining longer novel. It is by far the best psychological study I have read, and owes much of its entertainment value to the psychological insight it presents. Then the question may be: psychological insight into what? Well, nothing less than that of an intellectual murderer. The fun of the novel is in the psychological collapse of the protagonist’s mind, as he slowly becomes more and more obsessed and paranoid. Some of the thrill is also in the cat-and-mouse game that the inspector plays with the protagonist. Finally, some additional delight comes from the plot itself, and the actions involved. That being said, this book is not primarily cheap entertainment (although it does well in this department), nor a psychological study (even Freud admired Dostoevsky), but rather it focuses on the philosophical, moral, and religious implications of the actions, the mental states, and the (internal and external) punishments that the protagonist must endure. As most of Dostoevsky’s books, this one is essentially about faith, doubt, and rationalism. To conclude, if I would recommend an introduction to my favorite author (Dostoevsky), it would probably be ""Crime and Punishment"" (or ""Notes from Underground""). This is especially recommended to those who love psychological thrills. "
"1250",1249,"Torie Church","Sometimes classics have a reputation for being dry (and I'll admit that in some cases, this is warranted). Crime and Punishment is the farthest thing from dry; I found it absolutely riveting. For one thing, the plot itself is unforgettable, from the moment Raskolnikov does ""it"" to the climax at the ending. Philosophical ideas are woven throughout the story, with such themes as ""can an immoral act be moral if done for lofty reasons?"" and ""can a good person perform an evil act and still be good?"" This will always be one of my all-time favourite books. "

"1254",1253,"Charlie","One of my favorite books. Like Dostoevsky's other novels, the characters are so strongly developed you feel like you know them, and the setting so potently conveyed, you feel you're walking the streets of late nineteenth century St. Petersburg, succumbing to a nervous breakdown after having committed a senseless (yet perfectly understandable!) crime."
"1255",1254,"Leigh Hall"," This book truly surprised me. As a classic of Russian literature I was expecting to have to really roll my sleeves up for this one but It's a genuine page turner. The characters are vividly portrayed and the reader really cares about their fates.There are several subplots that are interesting but do not detract from the main arc concerning Raskolnikov's existential angst, which is harrowingly and yet compassionately described to the reader. There's symbolism galore too and this is a book that will stand several re-readings. If I had to make a criticism it would be that the root that Raskolnikov finds out his situation seems a little trite to a modern reader, but this is a book of its time and when this is born in mind, its importance as a work of literature and as a groundbreaking exploration of psychological and philosophical existentialism cannot be overstated."
"1256",1255,"Arthur"," I'm very happy (and lucky) that I'm able to read in russian, because in my opinion tough classic novels (such as this one) need to be read in the language they were written, so that the reader could experience the book in its full beauty. The reason it took me so long to finish this book is that after reading a couple of chapters, questions just started popping up in my head I needed to stop and digest the content. A student driven by his ""Extraordinary Man Theory"" murders an old woman and ends up suffering the consequences throughout the whole story. A very interesting concept indeed. No wonder it's hard to understand the true reason of such behavior(murdering, raping etc). But nonetheless, no one has the right to take a life. As Raskolnikov said himself when he was questioned by Porfiry: ""If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be punishment-as well as the prison."" His own mind became a prison to him. I believe inner suffering is more painful than physical for humans. In the beginning I actually felt bad for his family and loved ones. Especially his mother and sister. Raskolnikov put them through pain and misery they didn't deserve. But in the end, when he was sent to Siberia, he finally found redemption. Redemption through love. Well it does seem like a happy ending but it will be very hard for Raskolnikov to start a new life while carrying a heavy burden. He's very lucky he met a woman like Sonya. May they find peace in their hearts together...  This book isn't a walk in the park. I would recommend it to everyone. Skip your fifth time ""Twilight"" reading (I know your obsessed :D) and grab something more serious. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. "

Eventually, they rise to better economic status by virtue of luck and personal integrity. Thankfully, it ends with a beautiful, good, and optimistic ending! Which is not what I expecting given that my head is often SCREAMING while reading through the parts and chapters.I had not expected this book to have discussions on philosophical ideas between mankind and society, and even onto spiritual aspects! The story felt very deep with various possible representations on the motives, ideas, personalities, and works of the characters. There is that itching urge that there is something more to them than what was written!Dark humor snippet:""It's wonderful that he has recovered consciousness,"" the doctor whispered softly to Raskolnikov.""What do you think of him?"" he asked.""He will die immediately.""This book definitely deserves rereading but probably on a different time in the far future.

"1262",1261,"Siddharth Mehta","When I was suggested to read the book ‘Crime and Punishment’, I was bit hesitant to do so, because of its stale title. But it only took a reading of few pages to shed my hesitation. I need just one reason to love a book and Crime and Punishment has offered me quite a few. Written by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, this book is definitely among one of the more impactful novels I have read. The book presents a deep insight on the negative shade of the human character and on the moral struggle between their right side and the wrong side.The Theme: “What do you think, would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds?” “The man who has a conscience suffers whilst acknowledging his sin. That is his punishment.” The two quotes from the book summarizes the theme. The primary theme of the book is crime, suffering and redemption but the author has unfolded the theme in a thought provoking manner with the aid of eloquent arguments. As far as the book is concerned, the narration and the arguments – and not the story -makes it a classic.Raskolnikov, an intelligent destitute youth, who believes in the philosophy that it is right to do wrong against some people for the greater good, dreams himself equivalent to Napoleon and commits a murder, what follows next is his struggle with his self. The moral struggle of Raskolnikov is so beautifully depicted that it arouses the feelings of empathy, pity, hatred, all at once towards him.Rating 4/5The Characters and the Scope: The book is filthy rich in terms of characters. Besides the protagonist there are other powerful characters, each very impressionable. There is a beautiful and chaste sister of Raskolnikov who believes in sacrificing self for the well being of others. There is Pyotr Luzhin, a pervert wealthy man who wants to marry a poor girl so that she remains indebted to him. There is a prostitute, Sonya in whom Raskolnikov finds some salvage for his crime. There is a lecher Svidrigailov with his interesting theory on flattery and lechery. There is Razumikhin who symbolises a true friend and then there is an intelligent investigator who lays a moral trap in which Raskolnikov finds himself entangled.Dostoyevsky has penned each character with a ferocious intensity. I especially liked the description of the traits of Pyotr Luzhin as and when he entered the story. One can almost hear the noise of the author grinding his teeth in anger while penning this character.The only negative about the characters is their mouth filling multi -syllable names.Rating 5/5The Flow of the Plot: The plot is set up in the semi lunatic town of St. Petersburg, the town with an air of warm gloominess. The author has at many places used the description of the town and its weather to set the shade of the darkness in the plot. The plot flows quite smoothly and characters come, play their part, create an impact and vanish without making their absence conspicuous.Rating 4/5The Language: The book is originally written in Russian and there are many translations available but I suggest the translation by David McDuff. I had chance of reading few pages by another translator and I realised how important a role the translator plays.The Language used is rich and lucid. At places the author/translator has used legal phrases and native words all of which are explained in the notes section of the book. The language used while describing the characters is vivid. Dialogues between the characters are always meaningful and as a reader I was able to feel the tension whenever Raskolnikov talked to any other character.Rating 4/5Overall, Crime and Punishment is a rich book – in terms of philosophy, characters, language and arguments. I suggest that it should be part one’s library."
"1263",1262,"Colleen","I loved this book. I didn't expect to love it, and I didn't start out loving. I hated the protagonist, I found the writing depressing, and I just wanted the story to end. But as it continued on I found myself deeply involved in all the characters, Raskolnikov particularly, and fascinated by his journey and the way he thought about the world. I devoured this book and wanted more of it when it was finished. Dark and fascinating."

"1265",1264,"Noor Alsilawy","if you really want to know how fyodor dystoyvisky mastered the psychological description of poorness,craziness illness, crime, prison and all tough life experiences mentioned in his novels...well, that's bcz he experienced them all in his own personal life!!He experienced poorness as he was born withen poor family,and in his late life after the death of his 1st wife he had depression and gambiling issues which caused him financal problems to the point that he begged people for money.He experienced illness as he had epilepcy and his mother had tuberculosis.He experianced crime and prison as his father was murdered, and as he was sentenced for 10 yr, spent 4 yrs of them exiled in siberia with criminals and was released due to his frequent epileptic seizures. This guy biography is an indian movie !! And in each one of his novels, he left traces of his own life struggles. His novels are worthy reading for sure ^_^ "

"1267",1266,"Tom","So much has already been written about this book that it would be nearly impossible for me to say anything new or insightful about it. It is, as has been noted in numerous circles, the perfect psychological study of the criminal mind."
"1268",1267,"Mina Soare","Books created me since when I reached to my mother's knee. She taught me to read when I was three and the first book I remember reading is that with the dwarf called Rupelstilskin. Books hid me when the world seemed to strange and taught me to understand it. When I read I dive into its universe entirely and I am born again to live a life that I can't experiment otherwise. People would shout and I wouldn't hear them, and for hours after I'd have finished the book I would still borrow characteristics of the character whose life I'd borrowed.When I read I become, again and again. This and Dostoievski's ""The Idiot"" were extremely disturbing for me as I couldn't understand them, as their characters weren't average or logical, it seemed to me like he was juggling personalities, like the book was constantly shutting me out. I would stop and start again, bored, annoyed and when I'd finish I'd say ""Hey, not fair"", because I still can't understand. My mind travels, searches and slowly unravels severall words that I overlooked on the last page where in a moment of extreme agony at the end of a slow subtile tortre, and the joy of purification trough pain, the main character in stripped of all masks and shows us for a second the brightness of an untained soul. This book is an essay about Remorse - the character feels everything but, and the whole book except the ending, is like a desert in what regards that particular emotion. The protagonist lives without remorse - except for the very end. That particular moment when he crashes at Sonya's feet, when he's healed, that's when he feels remorse and the feeling that engulfed me then was like I've reached the end of the dessert and drank a mouthfull of water.In ""Crime and Punishment"" Raskolnikov doesn't have a plan, he's cornered, weak, and constantly battling inside with his conscience. He tries to understand himself, yet after the fact. He can't-he's shaken- he tries to find normality, yet he's secluded, while surrounded by people who are either naive or hostile. The catalizor is the madman Svidrigailov, who, in my opinion becomes for a short precious time the voice of the divine. It is a mixed divine, neither God or the devil, yet a subtle Puppeteer. He comes and chides yet has no desire to actually tip the balance of Raskolnikov's fate. He is always there, in the crowd, growing more impatient, yet always unwiling to take action. He also represents Raskolnikov's conscience, almost saying ""I know, can you see me everyday and ignore me?"". When Raskolnikov finally makes a choice, he tells Dunia, with the purpose of making her depend on him but fails. Here his madness gets a grip on him and he tries to force her, but when he understands she won't love him, he sinks into madness again, when he understands that there is nothing for him in this world anymore and dies.In my opinion this book deserves five stars because it is a perfectly made literary jigsaw. You search and search, trying to unserstand Rodyon, and he always changes and matures, getting out of your fingers every time, yet, in the end, when the last piece is in place he strips himself of pride, of theories of his high ideals, and shows us his soul. Comparing this with The Idiot, I've come with this idea: perhaps most of Dostoievsky's books portray characters lacking a particular feeling. Sadly enough, this particular string of epiphanies came to me in 2011 - it would have been a lot more pleasing to have named the book Remorse or Pain(The Idiot), but then, perhaps it wouldn't have been that popular... I daren't guess at the author's thoughts."
"1269",1268,"Pieter","Beste boek over schuldbesef dat ik ooit heb gelezen. Kan en zou eigenlijk ook moeten gelezen worden door iedere christen. Het broeierig, ziek hoofdpersonage wordt goed geschetst, maar vooral het innerlijk proces naar boetedoening toe, wordt schitterend verwoord. Een echte aanrader! "
"1270",1269,"Daniel Lee","Randomly, it is the perfect time in our nation's history for me to read a novel about a poor college student who is driven to steal and murder because of the weight of his debt and paltry job prospects. My first Dostoyevsky book in almost 8 years was worth the wait. I'd forgotten how deep inside the mind of his characters Dostoyevsky dove. The circumstances of the driving incident of the narrative came as a bit of a shock and the many side streets that the narrative took as a result were endlessly engrossing. This book left such a profound impression on me that the last three nights I read it I had fever dreams about being the the Raskilnokov's situation and not being able to find a way out. I was curious how I would respond to the christian themes that always seep into Dostoyevsky's work but they were muted and therefore more palatable."
"1271",1270,"David Williams","A brilliant look into a mind wracked in guilt and the desperate stages of falling into despair. Reading this book i felt so engrossed in it and felt a small affinity with the main character as his thoughts closed in on himself and isolated him from all others around him."
"1272",1271,"Yvonne","This book started out slow and was a challenge to read out-loud due to the old-language used; however, it moved quickly soon enough. It wasn't as daunting to read as many other people made out. I'd heard that it was filled with run-on sentences and a complex story-line. It really wasn't bad. In fact, it was especially good. Reading the critiques at the end of the book really helpful in understanding hidden messages and potential interpretations."
"1273",1272,"Beia Georgiana","This book is a masterpiece. Everyone who has read Crime and Punishment should, in my opinion, be fascinated by it. The way Dostoyevsky describes Raskolnikov´s psyche before and after commiting the crime is amazing. I felt like I was the protagonist, for I completely sunk into the story. A great read from a great mind. I don´t have enough words to express my gratitude for this book."
"1274",1273,"Haaike","Het verhaal gaat over Rodion Romanovitsj Raskolnikov, die een roofmoord pleegt op een oude vrouw. Dostojevski schetst een indringend beeld van een mens, die in conflict raakt met zichzelf, want hoewel Raskolnikov zichzelf aanvankelijk verheven ziet boven andere mensen en de moord dus beschouwt als zijn recht, wordt hij uiteindelijk toch verteerd door schuldgevoelens. Je werpt als lezer een blik in het hoofd van iemand die eigenlijk altijd heel normaal en stabiel leek, maar het ergste doet wat een mens kan doen en dan moet leren omgaan met wat hij gedaan heeft. Je krijgt inzicht in hoe het eigen schuldbewustzijn een mens zwaarder kan straffen dan welke legale straf ook. Je beseft dat niet alleen onze keuzes, maar ook de manier waarop we omgaan met de gevolgen ervan, bepalend is voor wie we zijn. Straf boek dit, zowel inhoudelijk als naar stijl. Het is absoluut geen boek waar je vrolijk van wordt, maar dat moet natuurlijk ook niet.Alleszins zonder enige twijfel een aanrader! Ik weet nu al dat ik het ooit nog eens ga herlezen."
"1275",1274,"Beck Wenger","I had read the translation by Sidney Monas written in the 60's. It was an excellent translation and made the book very readable. However, such modern language was used that it sometimes felt like the book couldn't have been written in the 1800's.I started out thinking that the author was terrible. The whole thing was written like the guy was either geeked on caffeine or coke. However, I soon started to read the book obsessively. Unbeknownst to me, I became darker and darker. My boy friend and loved ones started to comment on my mood. Finally, once I had finished the book, I was in a wretched depression. Ignorantly enough, in my darkness, I wasn't able to connect the book to my emotional state. It wasn't until about a month later, when my depression had cleared, that I realized it was connected to the book.From that point on, I've deemed this book one of the best I have ever read. I could not believe how deeply it penetrated into my psyche and effected my state of being and disposition towards life. Definitely worth the read. Great translation, Sidney Monas! I wonder if any other translator could have done as good of a job..."
"1276",1275,"Margareth8537","Read this at the start of my Russian period in my teens, and it affected the way I viewed everything else. Despite its age it was so readable. I hadn't realised that an author could draw so much from his characters"

"1278",1277,"Brittany Minden","Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. I find this book absolutely fascinating, not about the crime because that is absolutely horrible. Yet, I find it a wonderful book because it is written and made of truth. The main character committed a crime. In the world I live in, crime demands punishment, but most people run from it. That is exactly what he did. He ran. Yet, his conscience haunted him wherever he went until...well, I can't say. ""The truth will set you free"". I believe that is one of the main ideas behind this book, one of the themes and that theme is carried on in everyday life. Not only is this a good book, but it also based on everyday life. When we commit crimes, they need punished. However, sometimes the inward punishment is worse than what happens on the outside. One might be physically put in prison and then released once their term is over, but unless they have made it right on the inside, they will not be released from the internal torment. However, it does not end on that note. It also has a theme of sticking with each other, not giving up on them. When you love and/ or care about someone, do not let them slip away. Keep them close and help them through the tough times.Filled with thought provoking questions, this book will not only fill your hours with good literature, but it will also make your mind think to answer the questions for yourself. That is why I like this book because it makes you think and ponder some very tough questions. "

"1280",1279,"Jenniffer","Entra entre mis favoritos de los clásicos, a pesar de lo pesado, cabe decir, por momentos pensé que no lo terminaría pero las situaciones que van sucediendo dentro de la trama logran atraparte tanto que uno solo logra seguir y seguir leyendo. Crimen y Castigo es un reflejo de nuestra sociedad moderna, de como el poder aplasta a la clase pobre que se ve angustiada y triste, sin ver una salida más que él de lastimar para sobrevivir. Es el reflejo de la desesperación de un hombre por salir de la miseria y luego el miedo y el terror que enfrenta al verse perseguido a veces por sus propios pensamientos debido al pecado que ha cometido y luego por sus mismas justificaciones. No hay personaje más sufrido que Rodia y tampoco personaje tan santo como el Sonia a pesar del cruel destino que le depara la vida. Adore al amigo de Rodia, muy estridente pero fiel, hasta pena me daba porque Rodia se comportaba como un cretino. Dunia, otra bella santa, la hermana perfecta y capaz de sacrificarse así misma por su adorado hermano.Son cosas que hoy en día vemos pero no con la frecuencia habitual, sin embargo, están ahí."
"1281",1280,"Kate Buck","One of the greatest novels of all time, incredibly realsitic, hasn't dated at all, very modern."
"1282",1281,"Helene Moran","I loved this book a lot more than I thought I would. Although it was a little difficult to get into at first I was amazed at how modern it felt. I was surprised by how much of a love story it was too. I must say that the passages after the crime did make me feel incredibly tense, the author really captured that feeling of adrenaline that accompanies that sort of guilt. I found those sections pretty difficult to read. I was shocked at how lenient the sentence was - although my husband pointed out that it was hard labor and in Siberia so they probably expected them to die anyway. Really enjoyed this. "
"1283",1282,"Emily Abramson","Not only one of my favorite books of all time, but also a book that often enters my consciousness whenever confronting a moral dilemma, or when a morally depraved path is chosen and suffering ensues. "
"1284",1283,"Zachary","It all seemed so tragic at the end of the last chapter, when Rodion looks at Sonya in the courtyard, sees her in such pain, and then turns and walks back up the stairs. But then in the epilogue, Dostoyevsky gives hope that all is not lost as Rodion realizes his love for Sonya and his mind becomes clear again. The last three pages were an uplifting resolution to a story that seemed destined for tragedy. "
"1285",1284,"Erica","Crime and Punishment is one of my all-time favorite books. Dostoevsky manages to paint an amazing picture of post revalutionary russia, and the ""dangers"" of nihilism. Raskolnikov is one of my favorite tragic heros. "
"1286",1285,"Harish","One of the few classics I have read and has made me aware about the difference between junk and art. I am an avid junk reader and I won't be stopping it anytime soon. But this book has definitely made me question my choices and have lessened my appetite for bad books."
"1287",1286,"Trevor Kellogg","Although this classic appears daunting because of its size, it is certainly worth the time and trouble. The protagonist of Raskolnikov may cause frustration throughout the reading, but Dostoevsky's pure genius is undeniable as he flawlessly enters and analyzes the mind of the schismatic Raskolnikov. Make the effort to plough through it, and C&P will not disappoint. "
"1288",1287,"Päivi Brink","My first Dostoyevsky that I read in 1992 when I started my literature studies. All his books you can read over and over again and you always find something new. I remember scenes from this book very well and think about them every now and then. Everyone should read Crime and Punishment."
"1289",1288,"Amy Michalczyk","I had heard so many intimidating things, so I was on a mission to get through this book, and it wasn't at all what I had expected. what a roller coaster of an experience. The thing that still gets me is to the degree that I could relate. He says that people of his generation are lazy and don't want to have to work, they want the easy way out... we are still like that... is every generation? I had no idea! I think about it often... it is a different time, but the people, we are all the same!"
"1290",1289,"Theddy Blanc","This Russian masterpiece was one of the most compelling novels I ever picked up. It tells the story of down and out Russian middle class Raskalnikov as he murders an old woman to test his theory of the “extraordinary”. The story quickly became more than a murder; it was a psychological thriller. Raskalnikov is testing the fact that there are people who “according to conscience” have the right to transgress the will of others but can barely come to terms with his own sin. His humanity is shown through his hesitation and it is pushed to every limit until each shred of his person is broken down for us to analyze. The author took care to tear a character apart to allow readers to truly examine delusions of grandeur. "
"1291",1290,"Annmalm","We are reading this for our book club and I look forward to the discussion. This is my first time reading Dostoyevsky, and he certainly captures the human condition and the despair,dingy,harsh life of poverty in St. Petersburg. I would be curious to know how the different translations of this book influence the reading experience. A lot of the names are allegorical and I will need that explained to me as well as the many themes, some of which I am sure I missed. A long book, but worth reading."
"1292",1291,"Sheila","What can I say about Raskolnikov which hasn't already been said? A sinner who repents his actions done in a moment of madness. The novel, like all of Dostoievski's works, is infused with the dark passions and the omnipresent concept of 'Mother Russia' "
"1293",1292,"Cansu","Suç ve Ceza'nın kısaltılmış halini okumuştum ancak eserin tamamını okumak istedim. İletişim'in basımı oldukça iyi, yazım hatası neredeyse sıfır. Tercümanın herkesçe bilinen başarısı beni de etkiledi. Dostoyevski okuyasınız varsa bu yayın evini ve tercümanı şiddetle tavsiye ediyorum. "
"1294",1293,"J L","A mediation on right and wrong, C&P is the tale of one man's 'heroic' attempt to break free from conventional morality - only to fail. The most astonishing thing about the book for myself was the way in which Dostoevsky managed to capture the heart of the criminal with such frightening accuracy. "
"1295",1294,"Julia","Amazing Dostoevsky... that says it all. You won't like it though if you are the happy type of person, the book is bleak (in a good sense)in spite of the fact that the ending brings the promise of redemption - those Russians... "
"1296",1295,"Larisa Zimmerman","I identified far too much with the protagonist, at least I feel like my younger self did. I felt a bit like I was looking back at attitudes I had when I was a teenager, filtered through a crime thriller novel set in the 1800's. The book drove me to watch a multiplicity of adaptations on DVD: a Soviet one from 1970 which removed all references to aristocracy or class, but played up the poverty. That one had the best Sonja, hands down. Two BBC adaptations, one from 1978 with John Hurt that ended up being my favorite, and a really crappy one from the 90's with John Sim. My favorite scenes are the one where Sonja and Raskolnikov read the Bible, and everything including Porfiry Petrovich and Svidrigailov. I loved those two characters, and was very happy to roll around in their company a while."
"1297",1296,"Raja","Can notions of progress justify killing? Dostoyevsky argues no - resoundingly. I agree with him. I feel that he chose the act of killing because of its dramatic effect; because of its extremity. Raskolinkov's crime appears to symbolize any crime for the sake of ""progress"" or some ""theory.""Would I have agreed with Dostoyevsky in my 20's when I was fueled by ideals and the drive to ""change the world""? Probably not. Would I have agreed with him if I succeeded in becoming Hegel's ""superman"" and broken out of the moral fabric imposed on me by society? Of course not. Nevertheless today I think I understand. In fact, I am happy to understand."
"1298",1297,"Tiffany","I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. It has all of the elements that I like such as actions, ideals, beliefs and realism that is expressed through the characters. I am beginning to understand how society was viewed and how it was changing through the thoughts of the younger generation. I do believe that I will read this novel again in the future. This novel was translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. "
"1299",1298,"Justin Lonas","Why, oh why, did I neglect the classics in school? No matter, I probably enjoy them more now than I would have then."
"1300",1299,"Brett Thompson","Shocking and raw in its brutality; elegant in its depiction of redemption in the face of complete degradation. Its a fantastic read, quick and stunning in its depth and insight into the mental state of its protagonist. Don't overlook this gem. "
"1301",1300,"Jen Holman","I really thought this book was going to be a long slog when I started, but was HOOKED from the very first page. Far beyond a typical murder mystery, Dostoyevsky is as brilliant as I hoped he would be, managing to simultaneously paint a picture of the minute, deeply introspective qualities of a particular human being while offering commentary on the broader scope of human experience, on society and human nature at large. Heavy themes, symbolism, and nuance abound. A masterpiece and a delight."
"1302",1301,"Shirelle","Who would have thought that an assigned book in high school would have turned out to be my all time favorite book? Not this girl but it did!"
"1303",1302,"Chad  Nielson","For some reason I love Russian authors. This book is the ultimate psychological thriller. I felt my stomach twist up in knots at times while reading. You may not be uplifted by this book, but you will be compelled by it."
"1304",1303,"Karley Foster","I thought that Crime and Punishment was an amazingly gripping novel. An entire novel that is supposed to take place over a couple of weeks and that can still maintain suspense and dramatic irony is hard to produce and yet Fyodor Dostoevsky did a fantastic job. With its biblical allusions, color imagery, and wonderful irony Crime and Punishment is a must read. Absolutely loved."
"1305",1304,"Laureen","I read this book many years ago. I was about 20 and now I'm in my early 60s. I've rated it 5 because I still remember it as the book that got me hooked on literature. My family didn't grow up with books in the house and I found reading for school laborious. My now husband was studing literature at University so I started reading and this book has stayed with me ever since so it must be powerful.Russian novels tend to be full of self examination and as that is one of my favourite topics - delving into the human mind - I guess that is why. Be warned, if you don't have similar interests, there is no point in reading this book."
"1306",1305,"Darren Robert Bailey","Utterly beautiful. I don't think a book has figuratively dropped me as low and lifted me as high as this before. The literal literary bipolar experience.Crime and Punishment is a book we read from the vicariously sympathetic perspective of the people who surround and try to help the main character, Raskolnikov. We ache for the people in and around his life just as we pity him as he drifts along in his loveless, joyless torpor; a fog of mental illness, erratic and generally devoid of empathy.This is a book about the love-hate dialectic that wages war within every single one of us as well as within the people around us: to varying degrees, for various reasons, affecting us in various ways, at various stages, throughout our entire lives. The vicissitudes of 19th century life arise and affect these characters in tragic and humbling fashion, and we respond emotionally with empathy or sympathy depending on our own life experiences, to the usual magical extent characteristic of classic 19th century Russian literature.Overwhelmingly this is a book about the possibility of redemption in the absence and presence of its pre-requisite conditions, love and empathy."

"1309",1308,"Arunn Narasimhan","This IS a novel in all aspects. Also, this edition is by far the best translation of the original."
"1310",1309,"Tyler Koslow","This well known classic turned out to be one of my favorite reads of all-time. Dostoyevsky does a brilliant job driving the reader through the deranged yet very real world of Raskolnikov. Fyodor was able to perfectly depict the cringing mind of a guilty man, describing his paranoid thoughts so well that the reader is left unsure of the reality of the actual setting. Even though I read this book quite a while ago, I can still clearly recall Raskolnikov's paranoid mind racing through the streets of Russia, through conversations with the police, and within his own mind. One of the greatest works of art I've had my hands on. You haven't read a good book until you've read this one. "
"1311",1310,"Stacy","I know Dostoevsky is known for his deep insight into human nature, but I'm convinced this is the precursor to the modern detective novel, even though it's told from the murderer's point of view. "
"1312",1311,"Prashant Kumar jha","Honestly , I was dumbstruck after finishing the book. It is a literary marvel, a classic masterpiece. It successfully depicts the depths of the human psyche. I am yet to find a novel that depicts a crime and the guilt after committing the crime in such horrendous details as Fyodor Dostoyevsky did in his masterpiece. My personal favourite is Part 2 , when Raskolnikov is in a constant state of shock and delirium after committing the crime.Conscience is the Killer.."

"1316",1315,"Mary Burns","Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is a book that must be read not only because of its importance in the history of literature, but also because of the story. Raskolnikov commits the crime early on in the novel, and it is not until the last chapter that we learn whether or not he will be caught. Suspense is maintained throughout. Meantime, he tortures himself wondering if he is a true suspect, he throws away the little money he has on drunks and prostitutes... not to buy them drinks or use them, but to pay for funerals and food. He sacrifices nearly all to save his sister from a disastrous marriage.The characters are rich, the thoughts about good and evil are complex, and there are some memorable lines, including the insult one character throws at her landlady: ""You vile Prussian chicken leg in a crinoline!""The passion of the characters, the view of life in St. Petersburg in the mid 1800's, the disturbing suggestion of Dostoevsky's antisemitism, not to mention the challenge of keeping track of the Russian names, these are all reasons for reading Crime and Punishment if not for the first time, then again, as I did."
"1317",1316,"Artemis","Well after living through a power cut, finding the time I could to finish reading this, and nearly losing my mind, I've finally reached the end of 'Crime and Punishment'. I'd say I'd beaten it, but given what it's put me through it may have beaten me all the same.'Crime and Punishment' is bloody brilliant. A detective novel without the mystery, as it is told from the criminal's POV. It wasn't at all what I expected it to be. It isn't exactly scary or gory. It is a whirlwind of the main character Raskolnikov's mental, emotional and physical instabilities. It is psychological yet surprisingly simply written for a classic novel, for me anyway. A riveting page turner worthy of all its acclaim. Raskolnikov, an ex-student living in poverty in St Petersburg, never really comes across as being unlikable, despite murdering two women at the same time. He does various good deeds throughout the book, such as giving away money to those poorer than himself, despite this. He goes through the motions of his crime; though he doesn't see it as a crime. One of his theories (he constantly mutters to himself, and writes articles) is that human beings - of the extraordinary, liberal kind not taken by order and system - have to go low and commit something considered outside the norm in society and politics, in order to become a revolutionary and aim higher in life for the ""good"" of mankind. He thinks the women he killed were nothing but worthless louses. But he experiences guilt and madness before and after he commits cold-blooded murder, and to him this shows he was not born to become a revolutionary figure, but an ordinary man of ethics trying to get through life like everyone else he knows.Much of 'Crime and Punishment' is about Raskolnikov suffering the risk of getting caught, his views and theories being challenged, and about the people around him who are affected by his actions.Raskolnikov's former university friend Razumikhin is his polar opposite. He is one of my favourite characters - a right chatterbox and an outrageous man of convictions, never giving up on his friends - a great contrast to Raskolnikov's sullen and closed-off personality. His sister Dunya is a firm martyr, especially concerning her impoverished brother - perhaps too selfless for her own good. And there's Sonya, a teenage prostitute living in worse conditions than Raskolnikov; with a home life away from her family whom she tries to support. Her stepmother Katerina Ivanovna is losing her mind more and more each day that passes. But Sonya keeps faith and relies on God, even though this could cause her further harm (making her another contrast to Raskolnikov, who is an atheist). I was a little disappointed that she isn't very strong - she's a typical feeble and saintly female - but I suppose Dunya is meant to fill the role of the strong and assertive female character. Sonya may be Raskolnikov's salvation in many ways; something that the police detectives of this novel cannot achieve.Oh, and Ilya ""Gunpowder"" Petrovich is awesome.One of the great themes of 'Crime and Punishment' that puts it ahead of its time, one I feel I can talk about in an interesting way (by which I mean an original way as far as I know), is a certain view on women in society:One character, Svidrigailov, at one point in the story talks to Raskolnikov about how all women can't resist flattery, and that basically any bloke can catch any bird he wants in his net so long as he makes her feel good about herself, thus she is open to being taken advantage of and then tossed aside when the man gets bored with her. Svidrigailov is a villain, in case you didn't guess. I have my theory about the social art of ""flattery"". Women, especially from the 1800s, live hard lives. They are made to believe that their looks are all that men want from them, and that they need men in order to be whole and happy, regardless of how they live. When they get no compliments from them they feel that something that is beyond their control is their fault. So when a man does pay her compliments - ""flatters"" her, as it were - she feels she is something worthwhile. Someone worth existing. She believes or wants to believe that this man genuinely likes her and thinks her special. This also paints men in a bad and pitying light, as it suggests that they are all manipulative lechers who see women as easy gain for their sexual pleasures - by using flattery they can play the Nice Guy role until they eventually make their conscious or unconscious wants clear, which can be revealed years later. Svidrigailov's theory suggests this unfortunate rift and relationship between the sexes; that men are basically programmed to be unfaithful and unable to resist bare lady skin, and that women are damned if they do and damned if they don't get into loving relationships with men. This leaves women either being seen as stuck-up bitches who are ""mean"" to guys, or as ""whores"" (a hateful word too much overused nowadays) with too much freedom. In the words of Maaka Albarn from 'Soul Eater': ""You accuse women of making assumptions without reason, but what reason do men have for cheating?""Of course there are decent and genuinely nice men in the world, and Svidrigailov is making excuses for his actions much in the way Raskolnikov excuses his own: by inventing theories that may or may not be true and may or may not be all that original to begin with. Like a true coward he makes these excuses rather than taking his flaws to heart and working on them in order to change himself, to become a better man. Safe to say that Svidrigailov gets to suffer near the end in a creative and creepy fashion, when we are put into his head for a time. A significant difference between him and the novel's ""hero"" is that one of them takes the coward's way out of his suffering. Plus, given the number of women who die horribly and are often in situations where they could get raped in 'Crime and Punishment', I wouldn't call it a feminist read.Indeed the novel isn't perfect. A few characters, such as Luzhin, disappear near the end without much of a finale to their arcs. And it took me a while to get used to the Russian names and nicknames so I could tell each character apart, as some names look very similar to others.However, how could a few little things ruin a whole achievement of literature? 'Crime and Punishment' is a beast of a book that anyone can and should read at least once, even if they don't like classic novels. Gritty, intelligent, unpleasant but unputdownable, and filled with despicable and unforgettable characters, 'Crime and Punishment' fairly tired me out.And I won't stop thinking about it any time soon.Final Score: 5/5"
"1318",1317,"Loïc","""Psychologie de l'assassin"". Ces trois mots résument bien le contenu de ""Crime et Châtiment"". On est plongés dans Saint Petersbourg, et on voit évoluer une ribambelle de personnages tous plus vrais que nature. Raskolnikov, le personnage principal et l'assassin, a une théorie qui justifie son acte. Malgré tout, il est parfois difficile de passer de la théorie à l'action... et c'est une des thèses que ce livre défend. Il décrit le chemin psychologique torturé du ""héros"" et c'est tout son intérêt: en lisant ces lignes, on s'immerge dans l'esprit de l'assassin, et on finit presque par le comprendre. C'est original et pas si désagréable tant Dostoyevsky rend les personnages et les situations réels. Un classique. Très original. A lire. "
"1319",1318,"Lowed","“Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn?” Marmeladov’s question came suddenly into his mind, “for every man must have somewhere to turn. . . .”A bit heavy in Philosophy at times. But so far a good read. It made me ask Had the world been better off without Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili?It begins with the decision of an impoverished student, Raskolnikov, to rob and kill a pawnbroker, having justified his decision with the argument that her death will do the world more good than harm, both because she cheats her clients and because the money from the robbery will give him the start he needs to become a great man and ultimately benefit humanity.The action of the novel is confined to the day of the murder and a few days following it, during which time, in addition to dealing with a murder investigation led by a clever and intriguing detective who suspects him, Raskolnikov spends time with his mother and sister, who have just come to visit, and with the tragic Marmeladov family, consisting of a drunken father, a consumptive mother, three young children, and an eighteen-year old girl who is forced into prostitution in order to support the family.There are reasons that this book is considered one of the most celebrated books in Russian literature. And you need to find that out by getting a copy of this dang lit! Can someone lend me a copy of the Idiot please?"
"1320",1319,"Kelly","Dostoevsky walks a fine line between genius and psychopath in this pseudo-memoir of the same. The hero of the story, Raskolnikov, tests himself to determine if he is a great man by committing a murder. If I remember correctly, he hypothesizes that a great man would be able to handle it psychologically. I suppose evidence from his experience would indicate that the null hypothesis holds true. You'll have to read it to see what that means. When I read the book in 1999, I had just finished serving as a missionary in Eastern Europe, so I was eager to read something non-scriptural, but still brimming with missionary naivete and sweetness. It frightened me to feel so drawn into the mindset of a murderer. His character was written with such richness and authenticity that it was hard not to relate to him, even as his soul spiraled into hell."

"1322",1321,"Sophie","Read and liked this in high school, then read and LOVED it for my Dostoevsky class. First of all the translation was superb, it was just bristling with intellectual and psychological intensity. This book is so dense and emotionally riveting, it's the ultimate book to get totally engrossed in and lose yourself in and find new elements as you read it over and over. I guess if there's one flaw it's that Sonya is sort of the cloyingly saintly victim, but all the Russian books I've read have that character (Lara in Dr. Zhivago, Kitty in Anna Karenina, etc)"

 ""It began with the socialist doctrine. You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing more; no other causes admitted.""
Dostevesky begins by very slowly painting a dark world full of poverty and hopelessness. The the story moves very slowly, v...e...r...y s...l..o..w...l..y in the first two parts. I actually lost the number of times Rashkilonov fell ill during the book. His psychology and morality being the main subject of the book. Then there is fact that each character has three names.R. is a good man - a man of golden heart. He doesn't believe he has done anything wrong but is greatly depressed by his condition. He knew after once he got his education, it would be far easier to manage his finaces- it was a question of those first steps which were difficult.
""A special little theory came in too—a theory of a sort—dividing mankind, you see, into material and superior persons, that is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their superiority, who make laws for the rest of mankind, the material, that is....""
Socrates once said nobody knowingly commits a wrong. Logic though is a slave to passion which in turn is influenced by circumstances. Now R. was living in miserable circumstances, was greatly intelligent and was worried about poverty of his family. He was an atheist and thus his morality doesn't have divine backing: 
There are no sacred traditions amongst us, especially in the educated class.
His extreme sulkiness doesn't help either. Thus when he saw a social parasite of a women - his hatred would have made him believe that she doesn't deserve to live. Till the very end. he was convinced that in killing her he had actually done a great social service and nothing convince him otherwise. This is what, he argued, a great soul in his position would do. His belief in this line of reasoning is so genuine, he actually wrote an article on the subject. This is where extremity of reason can take us to. 
"" what affected him was that a great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing, but have overstepped the law without thinking about it. He seems to have fancied that he was a genius too—that is, he was convinced of it for a time.""
... or, as Mario Puzo puts it, ""Behind Every successful man, there is a crime.""R's extreme rationalism stands in deep contrast with Sonia's morality mainly derived from religious values. If you keep to old roads you are not likely to be lost (but you won't find anything better either). There are many other interesting things I would not detail (was Dounia tempted by Svidrigalov's offer? How come later deal with his crimes better than R did?) but in a nutshell its a great read. Its a masterpiece with a whole world inside. "

He was right.Crime and Punishment is an achievement in writing unlike any other I'd known at that time, and probably still holds that position in the canon of works in my head. I don't know another work that so astutely draws you into a protagnist's tortured psychology: you're with Raskolnikov every step of the way -- paranoid, terrified, exhausted, confused. It's truly brilliant. C&P set the bar for my own literary criticism -- it's a book, an achievement, to measure other works against. Dostoevsky has a seemingly magical ability to set the scene, both external (impoversished St. Petersburgh) and internal (Raskolnikov's mind and state of being).I need to read this book again. "

Raskolnikov begins to think that the police already know his secret, and that they are just toying with him.

"1343",1342,"Collin O'Donnell","“‘For suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing!’”Fyodor Dostoevsky is a man well versed on the subject of suffering, and Crime and Punishment is his bleak ode to it.When approaching Crime and Punishment, I had in my head the unfair assumption that what I was about to read would change my life and my way of thinking. This is absolutely no way to greet a new novel, but the legacy of Crime and Punishment is such that one can only assume that it is a work of immense genius. Although I cannot say this is a novel without its faults, it is probably the most thought-provoking piece of literature I’ve ever read. Dostoevsky, possibly more than any writer I’ve encountered before, has a keen insight into the way people think. He expresses in sharp prose what most people would only think about in the most cursory way. Raskolnikov’s wild, paranoid, cascading thoughts are like poetry of the neurotic. His ‘irrational’ actions are a golden representation of the self-destructive nature of the intellectual suffering from idleness. In my eyes, this is his greatest strength, and in a novel like Crime and Punishment, this strength is an absolutely crucial aspect to what makes it such a timeless story. In Raskolnikov, Dostoevsky created the icon of an alternate universe where man actually ‘dares,’ where the intellectual practices the theory he preaches, albeit with disastrous results. He is a figurehead for the folly of the narcissist, a man who foolishly believes he can conquer his own conscience, and his story is a cautionary tale of egotism gone mad. Raskolnikov epitomizes the hate-filled loner who is so deeply insecure about his lot in life and indignant towards those with undeserved power: the rich, the old, the moronic, and those who take up fashionable causes. At the same time, Raskolnikov feels a kinship to those who suffer greatly like himself, the noble, abused spirits. In this way, he is a character of great contrast, and one I sympathized with on a number of levels. As a hate-filled, anti-social man in his early 20’s who admires genuine intellectualism and noble suffering and despises morons in positions of power, someone who doesn’t currently attend college and spends almost all of his time in his bedroom, the plight of Raskolnikov, sadly, hit very close to home in this confusing period of my life. Reading Raskolnikov’s journey and descent into paranoia is akin to watching a slow death. Indeed, there are parallels between Raskolnikov and Tolstoy’s terminally doomed Ivan Ilyich. The intense despair and isolation from humanity that Ivan feels during his final days are mirrored in the suffering of Raskolnikov, who knows his anguish could not be understood by any of his peers, and also that the Sword of Damocles is forever hanging above his head. “One moment a spark of hope gleams, the next a sea of despair rages; and always the pain, the pain, always the anguish, the same thing on and in.”Dostoevsky’s portrayal of a man consumed and ravaged by the consequences of a great mistake is something any neurotic reader can sympathize with, but the fact that the mistake is something as extreme as murder complicates things. It makes the reader hesitant in siding with a killer, but more importantly, he questions the nature of evil by creating a whole cast of characters who are sinful and unlikable in one form or another. Nothing is black and white, and Dostoevsky's even-handed characterization is such that an ethical debate is sure to crop up between passionate readers. Is something really only a crime when it betrays one’s personal moral code? Are suffering and expiation necessary to life, and can they be good for the soul? Is there rationality in the theory that ‘superior men’ should be allowed to indulge their any desire without the interference of the law? These are just a few of the major questions the novel poses, and certainly not one of them can be answered definitively. Beyond acting as a springboard for intense thought, the novel itself is entertaining, darkly funny, suspenseful, and grim in a very real way. There is nothing particularly fantastic about the narrative (with one exception I’ll address later), meaning that the journey of the characters is just bizarre and detailed enough to be true to life without any vulgar indulgence into fantasy. The murder scene, although detail oriented, does not glamorize the violence and is described bluntly to portray the absurdity of the situation and the fog of ‘temporary insanity’ that Raskolnikov finds himself in. Great humor is found in the funeral scene, where Raskolnikov defends the honor of Sonia from the devious Luzhin, and a drunken orgy of hysterics erupts, resulting in the ejection of the consumptive widow. Equally grand suspense is seen in the riveting quasi-interrogation of Raskolnikov by the cunning and endlessly interesting Porfiry Petrovitch. The symbolic dream sequences throughout are genuinely haunting, with specific regards to the horse dream, wherein a ‘thin little sorrel beast’ struggles to pull along a large carriage filled with menacing brutish drunkards who brutally and sadistically whip the animal to death. It’s undoubtedly the most grim and nightmarish account of cruelty I’ve ever read. Crime and Punishment is, however, stronger in its philosophy than it is in plot. Some aspects of the story are superfluous, like Dounia’s ‘affairs’ with Luzhin and Svid and much of the material concerning the tubercular Katerina Ivanovna and her destitute children. While it could be argued that these are, in part, aids in characterizing Raskolnikov, this is only partly true. Instead of feeling like they’re rounding out the story or adding meat to the bones, these portions come across as being mostly filler, bogging down what could have been a shorter and more thematically effective work. It’s not that these parts are particularly dry or tedious, but they pale in comparison to the dramatic ground unearthed by Raskalnikov’s crime. Basically, when the novel strays too far away from Raskolnikov, the heart and soul of the story is lost. Another small gripe, and I may be in the minority on this point, but I found the relationship between Raskolnikov and Sonia to be unnatural to an extent and used as a tool to draw Raskolnikov towards redemption. I can certainly see why he is attracted to Sonia (noble and abused, his type), but her sudden and undying devotion to him is dubious at best, even considering her penchant for sacrifice. This may just be one of those things the reader has to swallow without question, but it doesn’t exactly sit right with me. Their relationship leads us to the redemptive ending, which I’m still not sure about. I found the epilogue to be bizarre in its brevity, and the optimism expressed in the very end did not exactly sit comfortably after 500 pages of anguish. I understand that imprisonment in Siberia gave Raskolnikov ‘fresh air’ (a new perspective and atmosphere), but it came off as gently forced. Despite whatever comparatively minor faults exist in the plotting, Crime and Punishment is a thematically dense work without being at all pretentious or difficult to read, and that is the source of its greatness. Dostoevsky’s coherence belies just how deeply thought and felt every page is. It is a wise character study from someone brimming with insight and life experience. The author suffered greatly during his lifetime, and the impact of said suffering was certainly indispensable in creating such a great writer, just as suffering was necessary for Raskolnikov’s growth as a person. To say anything more about it may be overkill, so I’ll end with a simple recommendation. Read Crime and Punishment, but if possible, read it in a time of inner conflict or anguish. I cannot see a truly happy and content person enjoying it as much as someone who is experiencing the consequences of their own ‘great mistake.’ "
"1344",1343,"Danke","I surprisingly really like this book. I kind of expected it to be wierd and boring cos the books you learn about in school are usually like that. Maybe it was good that I waited to read it way long after my school days. I didn´t remember how it ends so I was on the edge the whole time, waiting for someone to finally say ""You are the killer"". I was thinking about Sonja, how could she fell in love with Raskolnikov so quickly to follow him to Siberia. Is it just because everything is allowed in books or could it happen in real life too? I guess they were just two poor, lost souls needing each other and Sanja knew it from the start."

"1349",1348,"Marco","Oh Rodion Raskolnikov. How sad and sick you are. It's quite beautiful isn't it going through this book and wondering what exactly could cause his means to shed blood. It was not until the very end did I figure out what was his meaning to live was for. I do not see Raskolnikov as a psychopath, but a sick young man whose mind was inflicted by this parasite of delusion. Moments of this book touched my soul. Crime and punishment can be analyzed and rationalized in two steps. First is the crime, the murder, the article depicting Raskolnikov's belief in becoming a genius through surpassing the conscience reality of normal men through the act of murder in which he justifies through the slaying of a vile creature. The crime was committed perfectly. Nobody suspects him, nobody has a clue. However, punishment Is what is the true meat and potatoes of this book. The suffering Raskolnikov is amazingly accurate in the case of a criminal with a soul. If psychopaths do not have feelings and Raskolnikov feels constant torment and sickness(essentially a living hell) fueled by paranoia, contradictions and loathing then he is not a psycho. The worst punishment of all that I witnessed in this book is admitting to his family and friends his deed. Nothing can be as difficult as that. Imprisonment is a cake walk compared to withholding this terrible secret that gnaws and eats at your very heart and soul. And to be loved! Raskolnikov was loved by so many, yet to bear the cross of crime is the most heavy cross I have ever encountered in my literature and in life."
"1350",1349,"Joan Araujo Arenas","Estaba molesto, me parecía una injusticia. Intenté de darle vueltas al asunto pero ni modo, lo único que obtenía como respuesta era: «Luego volvemos». Mi padre no accedió ese día, así que tuve que esperar otra semana para volver a la librería. Quería llevarme una recopilación de varios libros de Sherlock Holmes en un solo volumen. La semana siguiente, cuando volvimos, ya se habían llevado el libro. No era de sorprender, para ese momento ya había salido la primera adaptación de Downey Jr. y se había avivado el interés en Doyle.Aún así, quería castigar a mi padre y decidí llevarme cualquier otro libro que pareciera interesante. Aún no había leído a Dostoyevsky, así que no tenía idea de a qué me enfrentaba cuando sostuve esta obra entre mis manos. Leí la contraportada y decidí llevármela. En el camino de regreso, en las primeras dos páginas del prólogo, se hacía un resumen detallado de la trama. Quise decirle a mi padre que se devolviera para intentar cambiar el libro, pero me dije que era absurdo reaccionar así... Después de todo, en la contraportada siempre revelan gran parte de la historia, 
lo que no hacen es decirte el hecho de mayor clímax.
En fin, leer Crimen y castigo fue un acto de descubrimiento, donde, aún sabiendo el asesinato principal de la obra, me di cuenta de que lo importante ante muchas historias no es precisamente lo que cuentan sino cómo lo hacen. De hecho, a lo largo de la lectura me puse a dudar seriamente y pensé en la posibilidad de que el propio autor hubiese cometido un crimen con sus propias manos o, por lo menos, hubiese conocido a un criminal y lo hubiese interrogado exhaustivamente ―lo mismo que hizo Capote para su obra A sangre fría―. Claro está que, al menos para mí, la primera posibilidad era mucho más interesante... Porque, divagando al respecto, cabría pensar que Crimen y castigo habría sido concebida como una catarsis necesaria para purgar el sentimiento de culpabilidad. Más aún teniendo en cuenta que generalmente no notamos la realidad detrás de lo evidente.De cualquier forma, sin importar la principal inspiración de esta obra, la descripción interna de los personajes vale más que la historia misma. Y es lo que caracteriza a Dostoyevsky: haber sido un psicólogo sin licencia."
"1351",1350,"Brian Bess","Action and consequenceI have long considered Dostoevsky to be the Shakespeare of Russia and always considered ‘Crime and Punishment’ to be his ‘Hamlet’ with its tortured and deliberating protagonist contemplating his way through a tragic epic and, to stretch the comparison, ‘The Brothers Karamazov’ his ‘King Lear,’ another epic tale of ‘filial ingratitude.’This is my third reading of ‘Crime and Punishment’ (the first time reading the Richard Pevear/Larissa Volokhonsky translation) and the ‘Hamlet’ parallels continue to a certain extent. In ‘Hamlet’ the hero reasons and procrastinates through five acts and multiple deaths until justice is met. Raskolnikov commits the fatal act early in the story and spends most of 500 pages wrestling with his conscience (and everyone else’s) until his transgression is acknowledged and punishment accepted. Raskolnikov even has a Horatio-like friend, confidant and survivor of the drama, the enthusiastic and honorable Razumikhin. Yet ‘Crime and Punishment’ is unique to Dostoevsky. It is a thriller of the mind as well as of external action, a thriller of ideas, impulses and philosophies, all at war with each other.Although there were undoubtedly previous literary works that dealt with murder and its aftermath, probably none before Dostoevsky probed the inner recesses of the killer’s mind with such acuity and the psychological maze he travels until finally accepting the consequences of what he has done. Even people who have never read the novel are familiar with at least certain basic plot elements. Dostoevsky plots and paces the murder as skillfully as anything Hitchcock ever put on film. The dilemma of cleaning up, removing evidence, retracing steps, trying to retrospectively reconstruct the entire crime scene and attempting to determine with certainty who saw what—all of these elements have become clichés in hundreds of subsequent thrillers on the page, stage and screen.Yet Dostoevsky’s purpose is more far-reaching and thematically dense than simply laying out the elements of a murder plot and the ensuing suspense of ‘will he get caught?’ or ‘how will he get caught?’ Dostoevsky possesses the gift of creating fully dimensional characters that are also inseparable from philosophical stances. Raskolnikov, the quasi-nihilist who justifies murder of one human being in the service of a greater benefit to humanity in general, is a soul in torment. His name, Raskolnikov, is derived from the Russian word for split, or schism. The ax is a perfect weapon for this individual who severs himself from humanity, dramatized by his decision to throw the money given to him by a generous stranger into the river. Near the beginning of the novel, he encounters a man in a tavern named Marmeladov, an alcoholic former official drinking himself into a stupor and neglecting his family. Marmeladov personifies the victim and his death from being crushed under the wheels of a carriage is a literalization of his thematic role in the novel. In the last portion of the novel, Raskolnikov has another encounter in a tavern, with Svidrigailov, the depraved former employer of Raskolnikov’s sister, who uses his knowledge from overhearing Raskolnikov confess his crime as a threat to hang over his head. Svidrigailov is the polar opposite of Marmeladov, the victimizer who feels compelled to seek victims that will enable him to achieve temporary satisfaction. Raskolnikov sees himself as a victim who feels he needs to become a victimizer in the cause of universal justice.Dostoevsky’s characters are highly reactive and emotional and his dramas unfold at extremes of human behavior. His prose, rendered with a natural spontaneity by Pevear and Volokohonsky, follows labyrinthine mazes of thought and impulse, like wandering through highly dense yet colorful woods in which the path is sometimes smooth and at others is paved with thickets to eventually reach a level clearing. None of the characters are exempt from being swept up by this whirlpool of a drama. Although Raskolnikov reaches the decision to confess and accept his punishment he continues to separate himself from humanity even in Siberia by chastising himself for his blundering crime rather than sincerely repent until the next to last page when his heart is finally cracked open by Sonya, the meek prostitute who accepts life with faith and an open heart and who has vowed to follow him through his penance. At the very end of the novel, he finally accepts himself as part of humanity and accepts Sonya’s religious faith in renewal and regeneration.Of course, this comes at the very end of a long and tortuous journey, too intense for many readers who prefer their characters to be either heroic or villainous. Dostoevsky’s genius lies in his ability to render humans in all their messy complexity, an awkward mixture of noble and base impulses. Russians are often thought of as highly strung and intense. Dostoevsky’s characters are in that sense the most Russian Russians one could ever expect to meet. While his stories could only take place in their fullness on Russian soil, he finds the universal spark in his Russians that characters from all nations possess and continues to speak to us with relevance across the centuries."

"1357",1356,"Katie Herring","I've just finished part one... My, my Crime and Punishment is not what I expected at all. However, I have come to the conclusion that Russian novels are a dreary bunch. Anywho, Rask, what a character! I want to hate him, because Lord knows he's crazy, but on the other hand... I feel bad for him. I was absolutely disgusted when I read the chapter about the mare, I felt so bad. Animal cruelty always gets me. I also had a feeling it was foreshadowing Rask's murders. I do not believe he was correct in his reasoning for taking the pawnbroker's life (or her sister!) She obviously had a reason for being the way she was, curmudgeonly and all that. She didn't deserve to die... To be murdered. But does anyone? (Well yeah... I can think of some people.)I like it so far. ------Just finished part two, wow. Rask is one strange little man. I didn't see Marmelodov's death coming at all. Jeez, that poor family. Maybe something with happen with Sonia and Rask, but maybe not, cause he's crazy. We'll see.------I finished it this morning!!! Oh my god, one of my new favorites. I can understand why it is a classic. I thought the ending was kind of cheesy though... ""Love saved them"" LOL I really wanted to know what happened with Luzhin in the end... Dostoevsky kinda left me hanging there! Svidrigailov... I still don't know how I feel about him. I'm sure glad he didn't do that... But I don't think he should have killed himself. But, I can see why he did.------It's been a month since I've finished this, and I'm still thinking about it! Probably because we're supposed to be reading it at school... But anyway, I've been contemplating all the twists and turns in the novel, and the truth is, Svidrigailov is my favorite character. I'm sorry but he is. Pip pip."

"1360",1359,"Alex Billey","So far it is kind of interesting. I find myself at a loss to see it's direction, but I am enjoying it every step of the way. Who doesn't love being a fly on the wall of a Russian basket case. I do believe that it will develop more depth as It progresses. So far, I would suggest this to anyone, as it is an easy read as far as classics go.  ***OKAY, SO I HAVE FINISHED READING C&P***I am really impressed by the ideas and concepts within this book. Dostoevsky, I must say, is a law maker not a law breaker; a superior rather than a material person. I walk away from this book with a generally satisfied feeling and almost wish that I could read it again, although I must say that it is a little lengthy and that the beginning seems to drag. It is necessary, however, for periods to drag as they are essential to the character development which is incredibly vital to the whole purpose of the story. "
"1361",1360,"Christy","Although at times it is tedious to get through, I really appreciate Dostoevsky's detailed writing style. He develops the main character wonderfully, and always gives the reader great insight to the inner workings of his characters' mind. On any other book, the ending would be unsatisfying and incomplete; however, it is perfect for this novel! Don't be intimidated by the length of the book, it's definitely worth it!"
"1362",1361,"Michael","Much to my surprise, this was a thoroughly enjoyable novel. Like Kafka, Dostoevsky focused on the great internal drama, which I find wholly more ingrossing than writers who focus on the setting. While the publication of C&P I read was 500 pages, it read like a quick paperback. There's not much more I can say, but, wow."
"1363",1362,"Andrew Fairweather","I admit, I probably did a 'bad thing' while reading this—I switched between three translations... let me explain. I began with Signet Classic's Sidney Monas Translation, but the book was so old that the pages began to fall out of it, so I returned it after getting about 10% into it. I then checked out a brand-new copy of the Penguin Classics Oliver Ready translation from the Brooklyn Public Library. I'll say about 65% of what I read was the Oliver Ready translation. I read the remaining 25% of it through Project Gutenberg, which offered the Constance Garnett translation. The differences were slight, but palpable.The cover of Ready's translation for Penguin (really, a most excellent cover...) is strewn with praise that this translation has faithfully retained the humor of Dostoyevsky's original. Now, I don't know much about that since I don't (and will probably never) read Russian, but the there is certainly a sense of humor which clearly came through when I was reading the Ready translation. Yet, it was the Monas translation which plunged me into my feverish reading of 'Crime and Punishment', so that I could not let go of this book once I began. I can't help but feel that this was an excellent start to this book, and I truly can't imagine a better approach. Yet, the drama of Garnett was incredibly engaging, and it must be said that some of my favorite passages from the novel came from her translation. Hell, I may not be much of a critic, but I loved 'em all.So, what's there to love? A whole lot. A story of the redemption of a student who becomes so swept away in theory, his theory of supermen, that he attempts to justify murder. What seemed to me to be the focus of C&P is the rift between theory and practice, or, the horrors of mere theory in application. Or, it's the righteous individual at odds society. To think, C&P predates the horrendous social experiments of the 20th century! In such a way C&P is *the* quintessential modern novel. As mass society would begin to grow to proportions never before known, the question remained... 'how must we control them'? Many nations in fear would appeal to that of a Napoleon figure, a leader who would tell the masses what was at stake, who would kill whom in the name of 'what'.Our protagonist, Raskolnikov, justifies his murder of the old woman and her daughter thusly :""The old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she is not what matters! The old woman was only an illness.... I was in a hurry to overstep.... I didn't kill a human being, but a principle!""similarly, in another passage from the Garnett translation,""This is a fantastic, gloomy business, a modern case, an incident of to-day when the heart of man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood 'renews,' when comfort is preached as the aim of life. Here we have bookish dreams, a heart unhinged by theories. Here we see resolution in the first stage, but resolution of a special kind: he resolved to do it like jumping over a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the crime. He forgot to shut the door after him, and murdered two people for a theory. ""Raskolnikov's journey is long and complicated. In this book there are hardly any epiphantic moments, only slow realizations. All climaxes occur through conversation, namley between Raskolnikov and Porfiry. His gradual development as a result of the steadfastness of his sister, Dunya, and his love, Sonya, is what saves him from utter ruin, while his seemingly aloof nihilistic pseudo character foil, Svidrigailov, makes an unlikely disintegration, falling victim to his own empty way of life. In this book, Dostoyevsky argues for none other than the realization that in no way is the transgression of murder permissible, as this makes for the foundations of a society of The Good. That to be human is to set limits and be faithful to them, and this, friends, is the beginning of society.To put it less abstractly, maybe, part of what makes for a healthy constitution is our openness to throw ourselves at someone's feet, to learn from others, and to exercise mercy and forgiveness—to humbly be amongst others. Much like Raskolnikov, many young budding intellects are swept away in juvenile wet dreams of theory and abstract knowledge, thinking that they know it all—overcoming this unhealthy sentiment is, perhaps, the true tendrils of what may be called wisdom."

"1365",1364,"Dominic","We are all Raskolnikov. Yes, let me say it again. Let it sink in. We are all Raskolnikov.I know what I am saying can be taken as madness. Raskolnikov is not only arguably the most famous literary murderer, but he is also arguably a monomaniac elitist schizophrenic. Yet I rest my case: We are all Raskolnikov.But don't misunderstand. My view of humanity is really not so grim. Nor is Dostoevsky's, I believe. So let me explain.I think what I believe about Raskolnikov can be best likened to Sufjan Stevens' view of John Wayne Gacy, Jr. in his creepy confessional ballad: ""And in my best behavior/I am really just like him/Look beneath the floor boards/For the secrets I have hid."" Stevens' audacity of comparing his own ""secrets"" (his own darkness, his own ""sins"") to those of a serial killer is admittedly startling. But it is not so much that Stevens has an unreasonable compassion for Gacy, who murdered, possible raped and mutilated a string of teenage boys. Even though Stevens points out a tumultuous childhood (""His father was a drinker/His mother cried in bed""), his fascination with Gacy, while it may involve some compassion, is definitely ""something different."" It's not about sympathy for all the miserable, despicable devils in our world; it's about sympathy for ourselves. When we feel miserable and despicable ourselves, we can extend our arms and help get ourselves back on our feet.And that's exactly how I feel toward Raskolnikov. I don't particularly sympathize with him (no, that is not it) nor do I condone his crimes (certainly no). His ""extraordinary man"" theories are incredibly muddled and intentionally confuse the reader. He treats others like dirt. In more than one way he appears to be out of his mind; yet I ""like"" him. Dostoevsky does magic with his storytelling, and I'm left to ""see"" a muted brilliance in Raskolnikov, one mangled by an environmental misery of poverty and drunkness that envelops him. Even when he spits on those who try to help him (notably likeable and ""bright"" characters Dounia, Sonia and Razumihin), I long to hug Raskolnikov and put an end to his torment. His self-imposed darkness, his internal self-prisoning is greater and more punishing than any bars and locks. And I want so desperately to believe that we all can undo that darkness and redeem himself.Buddhists use the term ""samsara"" to explain this darkness. Since ""sin"" is such a loaded term that emphasizes human flaw and implies punishment by an outside force, it is obviously avoided in Buddhist practice. Yet the concept is similar: when stuck in the dire pits of samsara, we listen not to reason and let our own neuroses control us. Even when we are ""offered the cross"" as Raskolnikov is offered in Crime and Punishment by Sonia, we refuse. We are so stuck in habitual samsaric patterns, more focused on ending suffering and embracing pleasure (or escape), that we can't get out. Buddhists believe, though, that we can pull ourselves out of samsara with meaningful and reflective practice, that we can control our negative, self-harming (and often directly or indirectly other-harming) emotions (called ""klesha"").Crime and Punishment certainly is a groundbreaking novel, particularly for its use of psychology. I find it to be a masterwork of plot and pacing and character. To critics who find the book too long, I would say that the book would lose its universal scope and human vision. Without Svidrigailov's perverted sins, without Marmaledov's drunken ones, without Katerina Ivanovna's hysteric ones, Pyotr Petrovitch's self-involved sins, or Sonia's self-sacrificing ones, Raskolnikov's journey would just be a morality tale about crime and punishment. And as such, it would still have value, for Dostoevsky asks incredibly provoking questions about ethics and morality; it gets the mind literally moving.But in its full vision, Crime and Punishment becomes one of the best statements about redemption, a generous extension to humanity that we do not have to be stuck in our habitual, self-induced prisons. For this reason, the Epilogue I find to be powerful and necessary (I was surprised to see on this site that the Epilogue is a point of much discussion; I love it).If we are all Raskolnikov, it does not mean that we will all kill pawnbrokers. It only means that we are bound to transgress treacherously against others and ourselves. We are bound to know darkness. We are bound to get stuck. That is a part of being human. So thankfully I know that with the wisdom of Buddhist practice, the love of others in my life, and the forgiveness (and redemption) I can freely offer myself, I know I can get unstuck, as many times as I need to. Dostoevsky says that the ""gradual regeneration of a man"" is another story altogether--but oh, now there would be one hell of a book! If I don't get to write this one someday, I guess I can always live it."

"1375",1374,"Scalacpa","This book follows my love for the great classics of the past. The Russian writers write such complex, layered stories. Their names must inspire all things to be complex and analyzed to death. Most of these books from the time frame of the late 1800's early 1900's usually deal with those people that are impoverished and those that are not. Each class has some with morals and some without.The story centers around a young man who decides to commit a murder. Whether it was inspired due to his station in life which was without any funds to live on, or due to boredom, or due to a psychological belief that certain people are exempt from morals or certain circumstances make it alright with society to commit murder, it was unclear at the end of the book. What was very clear was the guilt he endured due to his action. The book goes through the stages of his guilt, suppressing it, denying it, recognizing it, confessing it and accepting his punishment.It was clear that even if he was never caught he would always be punished for his crime."

Even in a simple incident or situation, he can show a deep thought or phenomanon. Firstly, I can add that, a book-worm is to read Dostoyevski or he would be kind of imperfect upon this book stuff or something... And an autor is to start writing after truely understanding the ephocal inteligence of him."
"1381",1380,"Debra","Crime and Punishment was a surprisingly enjoyable book. It was not as difficult to read as I feared it might be. Dostoevsky's writing makes one participate in Raskilnikov's guilt and ultimate punishment."
"1382",1381,"Joseph","Phenomenal. This is a perfect example of why people consider Dostoyevsky one of the best that Russia ever had and ever will have to offer. A gripping storyline that delves you into the psychology of a sensitive murder (a Dostoyevsky archetype) and his internal struggle with admitting that he did the deed but did so for charitable reasons. Most of the characters are likable and his persuasive and enchanting writing even makes you feel sorry for the criminal, Raskolnikov, from start to finish. This novel has inspired me to read everything else that Dostoyevsky has to offer and I would recommend it to anyone."
"1383",1382,"Gigi","There are more than enough reviews on Crime and Punishment, so I will confine my review to a concise one.The first time I tried to read C&P I could not even finish 1/4 of it. I felt that I was not in the mindset to read something that explored philosophical ideas, essentially I felt that the themes in it were too deep for me. In a way, I felt that I was not smart enough to really understand and appreciate the intellectual depths Fyodor explored in his novel. The second time I attempted to read C&P, I was intrigued and better yet - I was riveted and engrossed in the novel. Nihilism is also something that I am interested in, and as a Law student - I felt that it appealed to my legal theories and education more so. The way the themes, characters and plot interlocked was superb. I think it flowed very well and Fyodor does it beautifully.Additionally, I did not find this book difficult to read, but I felt at times it was slow. So I understand if someone who is in a rush to read a book, this is not the title for you. However, if you have the time and patience, you will fully grasp and appreciate the genius that is Fyodor. I must add though, that Russian names are very long and quite difficult to remember for an English speaker haha. All in all: An amazing book, that left me questioning and thinking afterwards. "
"1384",1383,"Mr.b","Qualifier: I dislike more of the supposed ""classics"" than I like. I couldn't get through The Scarlett Letter. I think Moby Dick is the worst thing, not just the worst novel, in creation. I think Anna Karinina could be 300 pages shorter (at least). With that said, Crime and Punishment is one of the best things I've ever read. It's brilliant on a Lolita level (and if you know me, that's saying a lot). I cannot believe it took me this long to read this.What makes is great? The psychology. The way the subplots embellish, rather than distract from, the central narrative (mostly). The conflicted feelings Dostoyevsky forces you to have for the protagonist and even some minor characters. I don't know if I can explain it. It's just great. You're going to have to trust me. "

"1389",1388,"Benjamin Vanevery","Dostoyevsky had a lot to say and he said it all in eloquence, much of which I feel was captured in this translation. I felt like I got to know each of the characters and catch a glimpse at life in St. Petersburg during the time of the story. This is a worthwhile read for those who enjoy literature for its art as well as anyone looking for a complex story. "
"1390",1389,"neeraja","An incredibly pleasant surprise. I was thinking of it as a book that I had to read it to be a real reader, but I was completely taken aback at how accessible, gripping, and relevant it is. I read it on the beaches of Mexico this summer and it oddly worked quite well as a ""beach read."" An intelligently-written, highly philosophical cat-and-mouse game that questions our concept of morality and highlights the often violent-seeming and immoral criteria that we use to select our heroes. "
"1391",1390,"Michael Ringland","Freakin' awesome. I read this book to be more literary, to make myself ""smarter"". Lame reason for reading a book, I know. But lame reason or no, it was great. Personally, I felt I identified quite a bit with the protagonist and it made me a bit uneasy. Russian names turned out to be a little confusing for me. Also, I had attempted to read it once before and stopped reading a hundred pages in... I guess I was'nt ready for it at the time. But be aware, that when the time was nigh I devoured this book, reading it on the toilet, on the bus and in the breakroom. You may find this book painstaking to get through, grasshopper, but I swear it'll all be worth it at the end. "
"1392",1391,"Sonia Schiau","Such a good book...such a great story ...such a clean line but in the same time a very complicated existance"
"1393",1392,"Gundega Griva","I was struggling in the beginning. I thought that the book was written in a 'heavy manner'. But when I got to about 100p & got used to Dostoyevsky style, I truly started to appreciate this masterpiece. Brilliant. Author let's you step deep into the killers mind and all the mental struggles and mind games his facing."
"1394",1393,"Donna Amado","Wow."
"1395",1394,"Naveed Nawaz","What do I write about this book? This man? And what do I write about his unbelievably brilliant understanding of the human nature? I actually physically felt anxious, sick, delirious, I felt like a madman. I felt the hope, light at the end of the tunnel, and the despair, I felt the pain and the suffering, the hunger, the brilliance of the mind, I felt contempt and I felt respect, Oh the hope! Oh Fyodor what must have made you write like this? What must have you been through? One can only imagine..."
"1396",1395,"Kelvey Oeser","Reading this book in high school is the reason I decided to be a comparative literature major. It is definitely dark, but it is a great character study and fully puts you into the mind of a murderer."
"1397",1396,"Leslie Shades","Of all the classics in all the world, this book (not this audio version) is my all time favorite of the classics. I am very lucky that I did not have to pick it apart in school and got to enjoy it to simply enjoy it. One of the worlds best and earliest psychological thrillers."
"1398",1397,"Richard Ward","A masterpiece of literary fiction, don't read it expecting genre fiction, even though Mystery Writers Of American named it one of the 100 greatest mystery novels ever written. Expect numerous sub-plots, page after page of dialogue, and just lots of pages, cuz it's kinda long. So much symbolism that you'll wish you had a tour guide; most of the symbolism went over my head but I still enjoyed the novel. Dostoyevsky pulls you into the setting, giving you a free history and sociology lesson with your novel, making mid-19th Century Russia fascinating, even while convincing you that people aren't that different no matter where or when. The basic plot reminded me of Poe's ""The Tell-Tale Heart,"" as this is a clearly disturbed person who murders for no rational reason and then makes himself crazier by way of guilt and paranoia. Novels are only as good as their characters, and this one certainly has them in the killer, his victims, his pursuers (real and imagined), and his loved ones."
"1399",1398,"Kinara Shah","Let me put this in a very straight forward (and perhaps in a little rude) way : The first few pages will bore you. The start : The story of a guy murdering two women and confessing in the end? That's it ?! Rasolnikov, you want to kill the old pawnbroker? Go ahead and Kill her already!! Why spend 200 pages reading the trivial? (Now this is what happens when you've read lot of lightening speed mystery novels. A piece of advice : Stick to it anyway.)The middle : The book speaks to you, in the most weird ways. Marmeladov's blabbering suddenly starts making sense. Like me, if you've always liked psychology, you are going to love Dostoyevsky. The psychological analysis, the theories, the justifications,the inner conflicts and most importantly, the portrayal of characters. You're going to see the underlying human emotions : the self-loathing, the hatred, resentment, mother's love, sister's care, a friend's worry, fear, every bit of it. How a man who has just murdered two women intimates you, how the protagonist also becomes antagonist and how you start liking a murderer is just beyond me. A scholar who thinks he's a super-human and therefore above or aside from others? Someone who I'd hate. And yet, a fear creeps in when he even thinks of giving up. So you're gonna say "" All right, I'll go for this ride. I don't like what he's doing, but I understand "". Avdotya, the woman I respect. Sacrifice and Tolerance, the reactions when she finds out her own brother is a murderer : Incredible. The crazy Marmeladov's wife : You'll hate and pity her at the same time. How is that even possible? And yet you will. Such is the power of human sensation. Razumihin : A perfect friend. And Sonya? Oh, How much I adore that girl ! ""An angel"" The reading of Lazarus : My favorite part. The tears, the anxiety, her sudden excitement,infinite faith, his cunning smile.. The master of human behaviors does the magic again. At times, you'll realize there are parts you don't understand. But you don't have to, let it be. Someday you will and that would be one of the greatest revelations,ever.The end : Marvelous. A heart-warming tale of redemption.'For he who has found love, has found everything.' Enough said. I did miss out on a lot of stuff. Like the beautiful mother, the smart inspector, Avodtya's husband, Svidrigaïlov's sad death and the list goes on! You get the point? Every character is perfectly described and every page is a memory which will be carved in your heart. This could be one of the best books you'll ever read. Or, one of the worst. But never mind. Someday, I hope you will join me.P.S : This was more of a ""Highly Recommended"" post rather than a balanced review :( But that's how some books are. "
"1400",1399,"azin","بالاخره تموم کردم این کتاب رو. فکر کنم تقریبا یک هفته طول کشید خوندنش. بعد از جنگ و صلح دومین رمان بلند روسی بود که میخوندم. باید بگم که این کتاب هم من رو خیلی جذب خودش کرد. البته در اوایل کتاب صحنه های سیاهی از زندگی طبقات فقیر جامعه ی روس در آن زمان نقل میشه که حس خیلی بدی میده به آدم مثل قسمتی که اسب پیر رو کشتند و ...این کتاب داستان یک جوون فقیر هست که مرتکب قتل میشه و همه ی داستان حول همین جوون و اتفاقاتی که براش میفته میچرخه. کسی که کشته میشه یک پیرزن رباخوار هست که جوون اتفاقا اون پیرزن رو شایسته ی کشته شدن میدونه و به نظرش پیرزن فقط در حد یک شپشی ارزش داره که باید زیر دست لهش کرد. سه تا موضوع کلی و مهم در مورد داستان داریم:جوون دست به جنایت میزنه. اما اون طور که از اسم کتاب بر میاد مکافاتی در پی نیست. یعنی تمام شکنجه و سختی ها در درون خود او و در ذهن خود این جوون دانشجو جاری هست و اون رو از درون میخوره و متلاشی میکنه.در نهایت وقتی که جوون به مجازات عملش میرسه این مجازات براش حکم رستگاری رو داره. یعنی با این کار در واقع خودش رو از مکافاتی که در ذهنش پدید اومده داره خلاص میکنه. و موضوع مهمتر اینکه در این کتاب هیچ کس به طور مطلق خوب یا بد نیست. مثلا یک آقایی هست که خیلی زن باره هست و به خواهر این جوون هم میخواد خیانت کنه اما در عین حال کلی پول صرف میکنه که تعدادی بچه ی بی سرپرست توی کوچه رها نشند. تقریبا همه ی آدمها توی داستان مدام بین خوبی و بدی دارند قلت میخورند و مدام در این مورد و درباره ی اصول اخلاقی قدیم و جدید بحث میشه و به شکلی که در انتهای کتاب ذهن انسان به کلی از طبقه بندی کردن آدمها فاصله میگیره. این کتاب عمیقا از ساختار قهرمان و ضد قهرمان متداول امروزی فاصله داره و به همین دلیل هم به نظر من حاوی یک رئالیسم اجتماعی خیلی عمیقه. "
"1401",1400,"Victor Movchan","По-моему, Достоевский очень последовательно показал несостоятельность идеи разделения людей на ""право имеющих"" и ""тварей дрожащих""."
"1402",1401,"Nicholas Cavenagh","Dostoyevsky might not have had the turn of phrase of some of his 19th century contemporaries, but as a work of moral and philosophical complexity, together with a truly dramatic narrative, this novel is unsurpassed and remains riveting. I am wondering why non-one has turned this into an opera. "
"1403",1402,"Nina","What can I write about this book that will give it even half the justice is deserves? I will try: this book is like living in the mind and soul of the murderer (with a conscience) who violently struggles with his conflicting feelings over what he did. The book is really an examination of the soul of a man - every man. At many points you see an out to go one way and an out to go another way. I think what separates us are the ways we choose because we know there is evil in every man. I read this book in high school and fortunately I had the most amazing English AP teacher who forced the students to really dissect the book and analyze the character. I highly recommend it for everyone to read. It can be a difficult read so you may want to read with a companion such as Cliffnotes because the symbolism is heavy in the book. "
"1404",1403,"Chris Burd","Another one of the Russian classics that I originally read as a teenager - and re-read for a college Russian lit course.Dostoevsky presents a character who deserves absolutely none of our sympathy. Raskolnikov is despicable - and yet as Raskolnikov rationalizes murder, it almost makes sense. You are with him - in his head - as he makes his plans, and you find yourself completely understanding how a man could get from reasonably respectable to murderous simply by 
overthinking
.In my opinion, this is one of the most brilliant books ever written. A study of psychotic behavior at its finest."
"1405",1404,"Emilio Mendez","Dostoevsky is the master of the novel and a master psychologist. Crime and Punishment is probably his best novel with The Brothers Karamazov. Who can't relate to the struggling student Raskolnikov and his ensuing remorse for the murders he commits."
"1406",1405,"Benjamin Dueholm","I don't really know what I expected from my belated reading of it, but it was more genuinely suspenseful and gripping than whatever I was expecting. Which is good, because the ideas haven't aged in pristine form. I'm also not sure I'm convinced of Raskolnikov's motivation for committing the crime in the first place. But what great depictions of introspection, what unforgettable characters, what dialogue! It's an odd thing to say after 629 pages and in light of my withered attention span, but I didn't want it to end. "
"1407",1406,"Rebekah","One of my favorite novels of all time! If you read this or any other Russian novel, you must get the Volokhonsky and Pevear translations. They are amazing and all other translations fall flat in comparison."
"1408",1407,"Marcus Schantz","This was an amazing novel written with the thoroughness of the 19th century Russian literary writers. As a psychological thriller it should be considered a must read for those who appreciate the genre. "
"1409",1408,"Zoha Trabelsi","Crime and Punishment (Oxford World's Classics) While I'm reading this novel I kept asking myself the same question ""Can a human life -no matter how worthless- be sacrificed for some noble ideal?"" Raskolnikov and I learnt the answer through a very painful process…I always find it difficult to review a great work such as Crime and Punishment… but what I can say is that this novel is absolutely mind boggling! The character development, the plot development... everything is superb and surely yet none can compare to the psychological depth that I found!It's amazing, heart-wrenching, and thoroughly a novel which explores the extent to which the mind can be twisted. Dostoevsky creates an actual human being in Raskolnikov. he is an insane mixture of hero and villain, Dual personalities... a tangled look into the scattered psyche of a human intellectual with an inhuman theory. I asked my self, ""Can it be the main character the hero and the villain at the same time?""This novel is the epitome of superiority versus the inevitable, His thoughts are to be reckoned with, unchangeable cycles of life, for no human has the capabilities to truly look past his conscious, if there is one present. That is the hero. Dostoevsky explores a depth of the human mind which he himself quite possibly cannot fully comprehend."
"1410",1409,"Ed","One of the best books I've ever read, and I'd read it again. Not because of the brilliant prose (translated from Russian, I'm sure a lot was lost), nor because of the incredible thematic imagery (although there is much)... rather, it's simply the philosophic elements of plot that blow me away. The book goes to the heart of the question of human morality."
"1411",1410,"Carlos Bennett","Me cuesta leer clásicos, sobre todo si además son de ""lejos"". La combinación de distancia cultural y espacial a veces me supera. Pero acá no; no sé porqué pero después de un rato me parecía normal que en el San Petersburgo de antaño la gente tomara interés por personas o que apenas conocían, lo declararan en voz alta y después se pasaran mucho rato ocupadas en hacerse visitas. O que la gente pobre y que no pagaba la renta igual tuviera un sirviente que le lleva comida. Igual el mundo se veía coherente y natural; me imagino que eso es simplemente lo que se llama escribir bien. Svidrigailof se roba la película. Todo su viaje y estadía en la ciudad debiera ser un cuento aparte (con un notable final)... su último pasaje en el libro de hecho me recordó un cierto cuento de Salinger. Notabilísima la escena de los sueños que tiene, nunca me gustan las partes oníricas pero en esto voy a hacer la excepción. De hecho todos los personajes secundarios son mejores que Raskolnikov (que probablemente es el padre, o abuelo, de todos los protagonistas postmodernos). Igual ahora siento un vacío. No se que esperaba de esta novela, pero ciertamente no trae la respuesta a la vida, la muerte y todo lo demás. Y se acaba después de la parte de ""castigo"". Dostoievsky deja entrever que la redención es otra historia, pero supongo que esa nunca la escribió. "
"1412",1411,"DilanAc","Wonderful book. Psychology, philosophy, crime, passion - it is all here. It is a book that once read will not be forgotten. The characters are vivid and complex. Their innermost thoughts and feelings are exposed to the reader more completely than almost any other book. "
"1413",1412,"Simone","""[...] In generale, di uomini che la pensino in modo nuovo, anzi che siano appena capaci di dir qualcosa di nuovo, ne nascono pochissimi, �� perfino strano quanti pochi ne nascano.""Un capolavoro: posso solo caldamente consigliarlo, impossibile riassumerlo o sintetizzarlo o votarlo e ancor meno giudicarlo.Leggetelo!E un suggerimento: saltate tutte le introduzioni pre-postfazioni e critiche degli specialisti e se-dicenti professori: come posso decrivere il sapore di una ciliegia se non mangiandola o come posso sentire i brividi dell'amore se non innamorandomi ? "
"1414",1413,"Greg","it was a book about the excuses that people make for themselves and for others, imaginary absolution to be conjured at will. very depressing and insightful. I used my speeding ticket for a bookmark and have just remembered that the library due date was some time back in June. these criminal acts ought to cancel eachother out, being on opposite ends of the spectrum of velocities. *broods in feverish guilt and turmoil*"
"1415",1414,"Gergana","Потръпвам при мисълта за ""Престъпление и наказание"". Влезе ми под кожата и ме завладя. Аз не че съм се съмнявала, но беше повече от истинска. Уникално достоверна, нищо не е излишно изопачено, показана е просто действителността - такава, каквато е в ума на един свръхчувствителен човек. Бих се изгубила и аз в болката и изопнатите нерви, ако не беше надеждата, скрита в края на историята. Надеждата, че ще има още една история и че тя ще е по-милосърдна. "
"1416",1415,"Inna","Это великолепная книга! Она поднимает глубочайшие вопросы человеческого существования и делает это очень тонко и ненавязчиво, как это умеет делать Достоевский. Будучи глубоко православным человеком, он всегда остается сомневающимся. Спускаясь в самые страшные душевные бездны, -- не перестает искать в человеческой душе признаки красоты. Самое главное его убеждение в том, что одна только любовь к людям способна возвысить человека и дать ему настоящую цель в жизни.На вопрос: ""Если бы вы могли прочесть только одну книгу, что бы это было за произведение?"", я бы ответила ""Преступление и наказание"".* * *This is a marvellous book! It brings up the deepest questions of human existence and the author manages to do that in a very gentle manner. Being a Christian Orthodox, Dostoyevsky stays away from the dogma and allows room for doubt. Descending into human soul's dreadful depths, he doesn't cease to seek the inner beauty everyone has. His main conviction is that love is capable of lifting a person and giving him a real goal in the life.If I were asked what book I would read if I had to choose only one, I would answer ""Crime and Punishment."""
"1417",1416,"Saidalavi P.C","Oh Raskolnokov! A poor martyr of an idea you are!"
"1418",1417,"Charles JunkChuck","If you primarily read modern NYT list best sellers, you are in for a treat. This is quite possibly the greatest book I have ever read--a few others may equal it, but none exceed it. The accomplishment: perhaps the quintessential fiction exploration of the human condition, contemplative and philosophical but still exciting and loaded with action, all draped in that unique russian ""something"" (depth? melancholy? russian-ness?). I've put it back on my ""to read"" list because once is not enough."
"1419",1418,"Claudio1973","Not Brothers... but still damn great! Dostoeivsky really was a genius. I am rather interested in the phenomenon of confession and this is a classic meditaion on guilt and confession, as well as redemption."
"1420",1419,"Razan Abushal","I was 12 years old when I read this book & I was completely taken by the greatness of this book. It was my first ever (more than 200 pages book) to read.I remember I couldn't put down the book till I turned to the very last page w/ tears running down my face. This book has a special place in my heart, will always do!"
"1421",1420,"Rania Tahir","beautiful story.. worth reading..loved it."
"1422",1421,"Hugo","Muy buena novela, no por nada es un clásico, el autor relata todo el contexto de un asesinato, desde los motivos que tuvo el asesino para llevarlo a cabo hasta su resolución. Durante el proceso, el autor describe con lujo de detalle los sentimientos, escenarios y personas que influyen en él. También personifica varios pecados capitales como lujuria y soberbia mismos que acaban sucumbiendo ante la bondad y el amor de otros personajes.Los diálogos son excelentes, uno que personalmente se me hizo el mejor es el del asesino con su madre cuando se va a despedir, revela el amor indispensable de la madre y no importa lo que sea o haya hecho su hijo, eso no lo cambia."
"1423",1422,"Hkudra","The main character tests his hypothesis that some people are born rebels and therefore above the law. If he succeeds in his crime, then he will be one of the chosen. Instead, he finds himself just another flawed human. Then he finds redemption through the love of a woman. "

"1429",1428,"Diego Escudero Graver","Aunque no he leído mucho de literatura rusa aun, el placer que tienen por los detalles que lograr meterte tan profundamente en la historia que la llegas a sentir y resonar en tu mente. Terminé apreciando a Raskolnikov, de pasar a ser de extraordinario a ordinario aceptando el devenir. Sabes que no terminará bien... "
"1430",1429,"Fabio","Not everyone has what it takes to be Napoleon. That is a main theme of Dostoyevsky's great novel to be sure, but if mere differences of talent were the point, it wouldn't take 500 pages to put it in a literary way. It would suffice to paraphrase Borges who simply pointed out that ""many artists take solace in thinking of all the greats who were not admired during their lifetime, while forgetting all the bad artists who were not recognized either."" Whether Raskolnikov can get away with it or not is not the real philosophical question of the book, or at least not it's true scope. The concern is with a society where _everyone_ is infected by the idea and ready to try their hand at moral relativity. In that regard I think the dream sequences are the best summaries of Dostoyevsky's feelings but I won't ruin those insights with spoilers. Whatever the truth of the big philosophical questions might be, the book's main pleasure for me is in Dostoyevsky's gaze into the small details of human nature, which is incisive especially when he turns it towards the ickiest corners. Scenes like the the funeral of the hopeless drunk Semyon Marmeladov are priceless and justify the whole book as a masterpiece. Katerina Ivanovna's delusions, Svidrigailov's depravity, Luzhin's pettines are all so full of veracity it is impossible to look away, cringeworthy as they are. "
"1431",1430,"Jelinas","As a Christian, I really appreciated Dostoevsky's deconstruction of human nature and the consequences of hubris.Watching Raskolnikov's slow descent into madness is eerie. As we listen to him justifying his decision to commit the crime that kick-starts the novel, he makes an uncomfortable amount of sense. It's scary to think that, with a little madness, we could follow the same course of action as our story's anti-hero.It's also a sobering reminder that none of us is above the law. And it's a sobering reminder that we're all part of ""us."""
"1432",1431,"Dotti Albertine","I read this to discipline my mind when I was going through a painful divorce. And it worked. Then I read several more classics and took piano lessons. It's good to have something substantive to sink into to distract oneself from life's everyday travails."
"1433",1432,"Yacoob","Na tyhle knihy by měla být jiná škála, jak můžu dát pět hvězdiček Dostojevskému stejně jako Conanovi? Každopádně je to opravdu výborné čtení, zcela aktuální co se týče atmosféry, psychologie postav i morální roviny. Navíc je to napsané tak dobře, že to člověka přímo fyzicky ovlivňuje, někdy bylo docela těžké se odtrhnout a nebo knihu znovu otevřít v předtuše nejhoršího. Prostě ruská škola, vedle Bulgakovovy Markétky určitě nejlepší s jakou jsem měl dosud čest."
"1434",1433,"Larry","I appreciate how Dostoevsky focuses on the power of guilt. I've never read a character who embodies this emotion in such a realistic manner. Furthermore, we see how Rodya transforms as his guilt compels him to blame others for his crimes. He is criminal, but his behaviors and reasoning are overwhelmingly and primally human. The monster in Rodya is one I would suggest lives in all of us."
"1435",1434,"nains","This seemed like one of the books that most people were forced to read, if not for a class, but by another passionate Dostoyevsky fan or nihilist. And I, for one, loved this book. The character development was subtle throughout, but none of the many facets of Raskolnikov were ignored. The plot was much darker than I was used to, at the time I read it, but this was a darkness that left me wanting to reach the end of the book to see where the light was. I need to read another book by Dostoyevsky to compare his writing style, but the initial style finally grew onto me as the book came to an end. Read it to read something difference, and read it to understand the kind of existentialism/nihilism that exists in pretty much everyone."
"1436",1435,"Luigi Campanella","ho divorato tutti i libri di Fëdor Dostoevskij. I drammi dell'uomo scritti in una delle maniere più eccelse"
"1437",1436,"Neddougherty","The Indian father who names his son Gogol, in a book by that name, tells his son to read Russian Literature. I have tried to follow that advice, reading roughly one Big Book of Russian Lit. each year. This year, thanks to the Maine Humanities Council Winter Weekend selection, I read Crime and Punishment. I was not disappointed and, in fact, was amazed at what a good story Dostoyevsky tells, not to mention the deep philosophical issues he addresses. I was also amazed at how much Dostoyevsky foreshadowed the existentialists, especially Nietzsche and Kierkegaard. Next on the list is the Brothers K. "
"1438",1437,"Dividerca","An amazing literary work. Although this is clearly a book of ideas, it does so in an unpretentious manner (given that Raskolnikov is based on Dostoievsky himself). It presents different angles through a series of characters and events, and this leaves the reader with the freedom to reflect on what is written. The result is that everyone who reads this book should do so with his wits at hand, as subjective misinterpretation is easily possible. It is also important to read this novel in context of Dostoyevski's time period and surroundings. Though you may or may not agree with the ideas proposed, the literary masterclass alone is worth the trip. I would love to read it in Russian, but given that my knowledge of Russian is nihil, i read the english translation by David McDuff. One of my first introductions to Russian literature, but certainly not my last. A must-read."
"1439",1438,"Jacki","There are many valuable lessons in this book. The characters all develop nicely and the story involves various aspects of personality traits, from the selfish, to the martyr, and more. I loved this book and walked away with a deeper insight into the psychology of a guilty, criminal mind and the one power that can overcome despair. The real lesson is deep. I will not write more than that as I fear revealing too much. A true classic!"
"1440",1439,"Andrew Pierce","Have never read anything like this before and I loved it. I thought this would be a difficult read but the translation was great. Only tough part was sometimes keeping track of the different names but other than that it was a very compelling read."

"1442",1441,"Merinde","Let me start by saying I hated the ending. It went from a realistic portrayal of a guilt-wrecked murderer to some sort of tragic hero trying to cleanse his conscience accompanied by a nicely idolized Mary Magdalene-type girl who seems to have no other occupation in life then, well, being saintly. Luckily, that all happened in a few pages, the last pages to be exact. So I didn't really mind. The writing is as good as everyone said it would be. You, or at least I, really don't really feel for Raskolnikov, you feel Raskolnikov, which can be a slightly upsetting experience. And most likely exactly what makes the book that amazing. "
"1443",1442,"Priyanka","Effin' brilliant! How insane must Dostoevsky have been to create something like this? A few hundred pages perhaps needed a bit of editing although I'm sensing that this can be said about all those Russians. It's an awesome feeling when you read a classic and see its greatness."
"1444",1443,"Negin","عاشق این کتابم. عاشق اینکه ریز احوال و فکرای قهرماناشو توضیح داده. البته همه کتابای داستایوفسکی همین جورین. ولی توی این کتاب خواننده با رنج قهمرمان(ضد قهرمان؟!)رنج میکشه داغون میشه و در حالی که بدترین کار ممکن رو کرده خیلی اوقات بهش حق میده. اکثر کتابایی که خوندم بین 10-15 سالگیم بوده و بین همه اون ها این کتاب واقعا نگرشم رو به انسان، قضاوت خوب و بد و گناه تغییر داد."

In 1993, I visited Russia and met with members of the police force in the police station in the district where it took place. They were totally shocked to learn I had read it, much less that I had heard of it. They were also very pleased by the news, but even more so when I told them I had read it in 1960 and not just recently. A very worthwhile read that keeps you wanting to go on to the next chapter immediately."
"1449",1448,"Shiloh","Finally! I did take me a little while to get through it. I kind of just wished I had a long weekend at a coffee shop with this book. I really liked it, but it was kind of a loved but difficult read. Mainly because the nature of the story, I would find my stomach in knots while reading this book because the characters and their thoughts and feelings were so well developed. And even though I knew the whole premise because of the intro I found myself wondering what was next. So is there a second book to this story?"
"1450",1449,"N Sexton","I was very pleased to find that Dostoyevsky, having been hailed as one of the greatest authors of all time, is not particularly difficult to read. He develops his characters incredibly well, setting the stage for an incredibly vivid psychological novel. He writes with verve -- I found that there was almost never a dull moment throughout its six-hundred pages. The personages speak in monologues half the time, especially Raskolnikov, essentially stringing you through their streams of consciousness. It's a stylistic choice that, for the most part, I thoroughly appreciated."
"1451",1450,"Elise","Extremely thought provoking. I can't think of much else to say other than that Raskolnikov was a truly mad philosopher that made some good points but was too insane to see that it they clashed with society. A nice story with a very satisfactory ending. "

"1453",1452,"dana","I had been wanting to re-read this for ages and just finally made myself do it. I don't know what I was waiting for, I would read this again and again.Being a mental health advocate and bipolar, I really get Raskolnikov. Granted, I'm not schizophrenic, but I totally understand the disease and many of my symptoms are shared with this diagnosis. Freud said, ""Dostoevsky cannot be understood without psycholanalysis."" He regarded Dostoevsky as one of the greatest literary psychologists in history, second only to Shakespeare.The craft that went into the creation of such a unique and tormented character goes without saying. He is beautiful and haunting all in one breath. I could read his thoughts as he would have them...BTW - when I read this in highschool, I totally made my mind up that I was cheated by not having my room be in a turret. I decided then and there that I was destined to own a victorian home - so that I could have a teenage daughter, who, when stuck in her goth phase, could live in a turret."
"1454",1453,"Brian R","A masterfully written novel. While reading this book, I thought for a while there that I actually was Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov. Dostoevsky really makes it possible to place yourself into the position of a mad man and experience his degeneration first hand. This doesn't exactly sound like a lot of fun, but I thought it was an excellent novel. You should read it."

I had to put it down two times because it was so grimy, grizzly, and putrid-dark, yet I had to pick it up again two times because I had to know how it would all end. Dostoyevsky is like a doctor assessing the modern human soul and his prescription is nothing but prophetic. Excellent, excellent."

"1458",1457,"Chiara Pagliochini","«Perché vivere? A cosa mirare? A cosa aspirare? Vivere solo per esistere? Ma anche prima era pronto a dare mille volte la sua esistenza per un’idea, per una speranza, perfino per una fantasia. La sola esistenza era sempre stata troppo poco per lui; aveva sempre voluto di più. Forse solo per l’intensità dei suoi desideri allora si era considerato un uomo a cui era permesso più che ad altri». Che cosa può aggiungere la mia piccola opinione a quanto si è già detto o scritto su un romanzo come questo? La mia vita ne è completamente schiacciata. Ho conosciuto Raskol’nikov per la prima volta qualche settimana fa: ha 150 anni, ma se li porta piuttosto bene. È studente fuori sede, a San Pietroburgo; la madre lo mantiene con la pensione del babbo. I soldi, però, non sono abbastanza, così ha lasciato l’università, non paga l’affitto e passa tutto il tempo coricato sul divano del suo appartamento, uno squallido abbaino in cui non riesce quasi a stare in piedi. Qui, morso dalla fame, dal freddo e dalla nevrosi, cova torbidi pensieri: sa di essere intelligente e forse destinato a grandi cose, ma la miseria annienta ogni sua ambizione; sa che, se solo avesse 3000 rubli, potrebbe tornare all’università, gettare le prime basi per una sua carriera e offrire una posizione solida alla madre e alla sorella, che tanto ama. Inoltre, sa che quei 3000 rubli sono senza fallo posseduti da una vecchia strozzina, egoista e malvagia.«… da una parte una vecchietta stupida, balorda, insignificante, cattiva e malata, che non serve a nessuno, anzi è dannosa a tutti, che non sa neanche lei perché vive e che domani comunque morirà per conto suo. […] Dall’altra parte, forze giovani, fresche, che vanno perdute inutilmente senza sostegno, e a migliaia, e ovunque! Cento, mille buone azioni e imprese, che si possono organizzare e aggiustare con i soldi della vecchia, destinati al monastero! Centinaia, forse migliaia di esistenze indirizzate sulla giusta strada; decine di famiglie salvate dalla miseria, dalla degradazione, dalla rovina, dal vizio, dagli ospedali per le malattie veneree: e tutto questo con i suoi soldi. Uccidila e prendi i suoi soldi per consacrarti poi con il loro aiuto al servizio di tutta l’umanità e della causa comune; che ne pensi: un unico, minuscolo delitto non sarà forse espiato da migliaia di buone azioni? Per una sola vita, migliaia di vite salvate dalla putrefazione e dalla corruzione. Una sola morte e cento vite in cambio: dopotutto è aritmetica! E poi che cosa significa, sulla bilancia generale, la vita di questa vecchiaccia tisica, stupida e malvagia? Non più della vita di un pidocchio, di uno scarafaggio, anzi non vale neppure quella, perché la vecchiaccia è dannosa». Sembra un conto facile, ma la bilancia generale della vita non segue le regole dell’aritmetica. Oppure Raskol’nikov non sa contare. Qualcosa va storto, nel delitto e nella sua mente, e quello che doveva essere l’inizio della sua ascesa alla vita si trasforma invece in una discesa: uno sprofondamento nel gorgo che è dentro di lui e che è la stessa San Pietroburgo, capitale putrida, sfarzosa e corrotta, ricettacolo di profittatori, usurai, ubriaconi, prostitute, affittacamere, ruffiani, pedofili. Raskol’nikov si trova intriso fino alle ossa in un mondo di delirio e di sofferenza, di ingiustizia e di perversione; il suo percorso si incrocia con quello di veri angeli e di veri demòni. È il 1865, ma il 2015 non è diverso. Attraverso Raskol’nikov ho fatto la conoscenza di altre persone indimenticabili: Sonja Marmeladova (il suo nome, così dolce, mi si scioglie in bocca, e non posso non pensare che la salvezza alberghi nel suo parasole bucato), il candido Razumichin, l’arguto e buono detective Porfirij, Svidrigajlov dal nerissimo cuore. La vera Vladimirka – la via per la Siberia – è separarmi da loro. Mi rifiuto di credere che Dostoevskij sia stato un uomo come noialtri e che tutto questo non sia che una sua creazione. Una creazione, forse, ma del tipo che infonde la vita e che profuma irresistibilmente di divinità. "

"1461",1460,"Luís Miguel","Sente-se o peso da autoridade que um clássico confere, logo ao virar a primeira página: “Crime e Castigo vs Leitor” ou ""grande parte adora-o, será que o compreendo? Fá-lo-ei meu?"" Ou, como Nabokov, ""será aborrecido"" A reter: Dostoievski é dos melhores autores de sempre, igual a Tolstoi, Gogol, Steinbeck, Hamsun, Twain, Dickens, etc. Posto isto, a desconstrução do mito: não, não é difícil distinguir as personagens em função dos nomes e a mais recente edição da Relógio D’Água explica o emprego dos mesmos; e não, não é aborrecido, muito pelo contrário. Temos aqui um estudante de Direito (Raskolnikov) que, vivendo em condições miseráveis e quase sem meios de subsistência (vive da caridade alheia), empreende assassinar uma velha usurária e, logrando tal homicídio, a sua convivência com o acto que praticou. Durante a narrativa acompanhamos sobretudo Raskolnikov e a sua sucumbência à doença física e mental, mas também as acções determinantes de algumas personagens, inserindo-se nos pequenos desvios à trama principal. Ao longo do livro questionamo-nos frequentemente sobre qual a justificação para cometer crimes (o que se protege com a criminalização de certas condutas?) e se o castigo/punição se adequa aos crimes.A escrita de Dostoevski é rica sem ser demasiado técnica, desta forma consegue apresentar uma narração cuidada e bastante fluída. Do estilo melodramático do autor, perpassa o impacto psicológico da acção pelo leitor, empolgando-nos nos trechos mais tensos e deprimindo-nos com os mais tristes. O desenrolar da trama surge-nos quase instintivamente, em função do acompanhamento interior dos personagens e seus sentimentos, conferindo-lhes bastante densidade. Assim, como Nabokov reconheceu, a veia dramática de Dostoievski é muito forte, e os seus livros lêem-se como se estivéssemos a assistir a uma peça (sem ver os actores, conhecendo apenas as suas motivações e percurso).Retira-se demasiado deste livro e com bastante deleite, pelo que, vou apenas vincar os aspectos que retive mais fortemente após a leitura: a doença de Raskolnikov é indissociável do crime que comete, seja a loucura lúcida ou debilidade física e social; é em jeito de crítica ao sistema de classes russo que o nosso psicopata favorito dividia as pessoas em “vulgares” e “invulgares”, sendo quase anedóticas as referências a mujiques e nobres; é também interessante a forma como Dostoievski “reabilita” Raskolnikov, parecendo algo forçado (talvez não pegue numa segunda leitura), mas funcionando como um alívio para o leitor. Resumindo: Um dos livros a ler antes de morrer."
"1462",1461,"Sykes","Eagerly awaiting the rest of the group to finish. I won't hate them if they hate it, but I might cry. Inside. I have a bad feeling about the upcoming discussion. I should've kept the Russians to myself. Too soon. I know better."
"1463",1462,"karl","I'm almost in a delirium myself after reading this... damn...Beneath all the ambiguous dreams, the irritable tempers, the somber St. Petersburg streets: there lies a painfully honest humanity. It never shows itself very easily, though. Not when there is so much poverty, so much preoccupation. But even less so when a young man builds himself up with reasons and convictions, blinded from the very human world around him; and in such a hazy state that's what finally brings him to commit a senseless murder. That's the crime, but the true depth of this novel lies in the punishment. And it is this relentless exploration of the man's consciousness, wavering dangerously between concealing the truth and confessing, that constitutes most of the novel. I have to say, this exploration left me in a wordless daze. There is so much suspense and tension in this plot, which masterfully draws together three seemingly distinct storylines. The characters, too, are well-drawn and enigmatic enough to leave you feeling alienated with nearly everyone—just like the narrator. And through the absence of his empathy for others, one almost starts to empathize with his character... to understand how one can be swept away by calculations, how one can simultaneously hate and love so fiercely; and most fundamentally, how one cannot live with guilt forever. Powerful. Has left me stunned, lost in thought and nameless feelings..."
"1464",1463,"Justin","""He had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out, swung it with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without effort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head.

"1465",1464,"Nik","An intriguing peak into a man pushed to the brink, and the action that leads to a series of events fueled by his inconsolable guilty conscience. He's pushed from one scenario to another through actions, and through his crime he manages to do some good for a family in need - which raises the question: was it really a crime after all? And was the punishment he was inflicting on himself worse than going to prison? With engaging characters, a tragic setting, and the underlying suspense of whether or not Raskolniknov will be apprehended,  Crime and Punishment  illuminates questions of morality, judgement, and human existence. I love this book, and the way Dostoyevsky writes (translated beautifully in this edition). If only I spoke Russian and could read the original text!"
"1466",1465,"Adeline","This is not a review:I will say this though, The Idiot may lack a substantial storyline - but what makes it such a heartening read is the little burst of rants Fyodor goes into every five pages or so.Not much of that here - probably because this was his first book. Plus the alarming nature of the few so rants perhaps makes up for lack of them.A thrilling storyline surely, bringing up the age- old conflict between what truly is good and bad and where the line stands - the theme I love about C&P is that never does Raskol actually repent his crime - it torments him, brings him to the brink of his sanity and bends him till he breaks - but he doesn't repent it. He believes in this 'theory' all through the book (save the very last page - perhaps Fyodor didn't want to end his first book on a depressing note - I'llforgive him for that, I would have very much preferred an Alex deLarge's 'I repent nothing' end-shot but I digress.)Raskol is a perplexing character - vain, egoistic (and sadly for me, lacking the nihilism.) who decides he is one of the greats and in order to prove that to himself - decides to follow the footsteps of all 'Great' men before him - plots to murder. I loved this story, truly - but I wouldn't read it again. The Idiot - I would, but C&P - not so much. Maybe the morbid nature of the themes here make up for lack of rambling here - but I don't know I wanted more. #SorryNotSorry"

"1468",1467,"Adina R","Crime and Punishment was probably the first dark book that I read and I was totally impressed by the language and the psychological torments of the main character. My only problem, which is common in all his writing, was with the Russian names. I could not believe how many names a person can have. "
"1469",1468,"Kim","Wow, I read this book back in high school for an independent reading class and it blew me away. The author pulls you into the mind of his main character so thoroughly that you will be regarding everyone with suspicion."
"1470",1469,"Ryan Ashburner","I found this story deeply fascinating as a translated idea from our author passed into our protagonist Raskolnikov. Through various sub plots, it all circulates to ideals and what seems to be generational opinion in the 19th century along with various opposition, agreements, and so on. The strongest display of Dostoyevsky's powerful narrative is Raskolnikov's turmoil of dealing with his written and thorough view on the division of the ""ordinary"" and the ""extraordinary"". Impressively we consistently see how this corresponds to his crime. The protagonist leads us through a journey through an unveiling discovery of where he stands as a ""Napolean-esque"" figure.It wasn't just the ideas that were masterfully portrayed. The emotional turmoil and descent into madness as well as Raskolnikov's questioning of his own character were also brilliant. He shows these post traumatic spells and emotional evasiveness from all acquaintances and overall a strong social distaste growing from before his crime to a heightened level after. From what I noticed, the story isn't merely the crime, but the emotional handling of the killing. If any of you readers are expecting an onslaught of mass murders in a 500 page book you aren't looking in the right direction. Expect mostly the after effect of a serial killing. Above all else you will notice these psychological roller coasters post-murder from him that mainly lead toward the negative or docile manner.The only real problem I had with the story may be attributed partly to the common writing of the 19th century, but also to Dostoyevsky's relentlessness to boast well-thought philosophies without subtlety. I could have done without some of the tangents in the monologues along with some long and tedious side stories and moments (for instance a landlady and Sonya's mother bantering for about a whole chapter). All in all the novel is quite large for the timeline it entails and I noticed some much needed shortening and quickening to the point. I also wasn't too concerned or mightily interested for some mini plots that while thankfully tied into everything, were perhaps dragged too long. (spoiler) I also think the ending may have been a bit too upbeat and positive.Going back to our protagonist's theory however and my final thoughts, perhaps what struck me the most was Raskolnikov's logic in questioning if it was indeed a crime, of course in line with his theory that he more-so saved others than destroyed two in the murder of a ""louse"" and the innocent witness. Not only this aspect, but as well as the law as a rather questionable and perhaps even weak guideline in moral behavior. Dostoyevsky did not fail in providing a thought provoking narrative. Perhaps he was more of a brilliant philosopher than a writer, at times zoning in on brilliant questioning of morals and food for debate for whole chapters. His writing may have not been the best I have seen craft-wise, but he is sure as hell brilliant."

"1472",1471,"Kristie Carney","The book was great. It seemed really depressing toward the end but I loved the ending! The book was great and to think I wouldn't have read it if it wasn't for AP English!"
"1473",1472,"Arathi Mohan","One of the most captivating and engrossing books I have read. From the start, the author builds up the suspense through the most minute details. Even the most mundane activities are described clearly, making you feel that you are living with the characters in the moment. Of course, the title gives away the clue that a crime will be committed. Yet I found myself at the edge of my seat when it actually happened. Such was the effect the writing produced. It was as if I am there and I am watching Raskolnikov as he goes about committing his experiment- the experiment to prove his theory that some mortals are above the law, in fact, they are exceptional. If they were to break a few rules or laws that were binding on mere mortals for the greater good of mankind, it was because they are entitled and privileged to do so. Raskolnikov comes across as a brooding, sulking person who is at times, tormented, and at other times, absolutely indifferent to the hunger and deprivation of his circumstances. And yet, he may unthinkingly and readily help someone who, he thinks, is in more dire need than himself. This is how he gets acquainted with Marmeladov, Katerina Ivanovna and eventually, Sofia. What to say of Sofia, she seems to have a heart made of gold that is untouched and untainted by the filth that she is forced to live in and to embrace as a livelihood. Razumihin proves to be a loyal friend to Raskolnikov and firmly resolves to look after the latter's mother Pulcheria and sister Dounia. Of course, he cannot help falling in love with Dounia, who comes across as remarakably strong-willed like her brother. Poor Porfiry Petrovitch fails in his evil designs to ensnare Dounia taking advantage of her poor financial position. Of course, the greatest surprise of all might be Svidrigailov, who is painted as a monster but turns out... well, for that, you must read this remarkable story to find out. "

"1478",1477,"Martino","Mille volte è stato detto quanto Dostoevskij abbia saputo scavare a fondo nell'animo umano, aggiungo solo che leggere le sue opere è come aver puntato addosso un occhio che scruta nei recessi dell'anima.

I'd found myself using a dictionary once or twice to get the meaning of certain key words.But ignoring all that, this book kept me interested until the end.There were scenes that kept me on the edge between Raskolnikov and his interrogator,It was interesting to see the contrast between raskolnikov's actions and his thoughts.I'd definitely recommend this to anyone, even just for fun. "
"1480",1479,"Janet","Loved the psychological cat and mouse game that Porfiry Petrovich played with Raskolnikov in questioning(accusing) him about his crime."
"1481",1480,"Tyler ","My next-favorite book, after Notes From Underground. The storytelling is captivating. The characterization of life in St. Petersburg is superb, and the final two dream sequences color the narrative with an ethereal passion unlike anything else I've read. If you read this book, you'll see why Dostoyevsky is among the greatest writers. Besides the narration, the dialog, too, is engrossing. Most of the action unfolds over four days, so the timing is compressed. Adding to the tension, the action is compressed further into a single city. This technique of the storytelling accentuates the sense of life in the Russian capital during the 1860's. One's sympathy is engaged, as the plot unfolds, by the dawning realization that the urban, anonymous life we take for granted now was an unprecedented, frightening and disturbing phenomenon to the people who lived at that time.While all the sub-plots are jewels in themselves, for me one especially affecting story arc concerns the woman with tuberculosis, which the author depicts with amazing talent. Another striking aspect of the book, for those who live in the vacuous scream that passes for discourse in our modern media, is the author's ability to represent all his characters' opposing lifestyles and opinions in a way that would be fair, even sympathetic, to each person. Dostoyevsky demonstrates this unusual grasp of differing points of view in all his works I've read, and this singular talent of his makes the difference between a good book and a superb one in every case. I thought the ending was a bit overdone and a tad out of key with the rest of the story, although many readers will disagree with me on that score. Even so ...For those who have read it: My favorite character -- Svidrigailov. The book exudes an unusual power to draw the sympathies of modern readers onto the special problems of 19th-century lives. No, I shouldn't say ""special."" Rather, it causes you to feel for the people on a highly personal level. Yes, that's it; that's what gives the book its exceptional power. "

"1483",1482,"Danielle Casseb","Se você matar uma pessoa que é ruim e muito rica, mas usar seu dinheiro para muitas boas ações, existe culpa no crime? Mil boas ações anulam uma má? Um ser humano tem a permissão de matar, roubar, ou fazer o mal a outro se o fim será benéfico? O fim justifica o meio? Dostoyevsky retrata essas questões como um gênio. Comunista na época, em uma Russia miserável, consumida pela pobreza e pela fome, o autor abordou a injustiça de forma fenomenal. Em uma passagem, o personagem diz acreditar na divisão da sociedade em dois tipos de pessoas: as ordinárias e as extraordinárias. As ordinárias são aquelas que nasceram para servir as regras, as leis e o padrão imposto pela sociedade. As extraordinárias são pessoas que representarão uma mudança da estrutura, do padrão e das leis (como Napoleão, Jesus, Darwin,... e todas as figuras que foram contra as regras até então estabelecidas). O personagem Raskhonikov ainda questiona: se Darwin precisasse matar dezenas ou milhares de pessoas para atingir seu objetivo, suas ideias, considerando que será um grande favor ao mundo e às gerações futuras... Ele teria o direito de cometer tais crimes para cumprir seu dever de fazer o bem ao mundo?Importantes figuras da história da civilização que tiveram grandes conquistas e ajudaram no desenvolvimento do mundo precisaram ir contra as leis para isso. Essas seriam as pessoas extraordinárias.O personagem, após cometer o crime de matar uma rica agiota se questiona se ele seria uma dessas pessoas extraordinárias que tinham a permissão, o dever de se livrar de um ser humano ruim para ajudar outros bons. Porém, apesar de tudo, ele se vê consumido pela própria consciência, pois - mesmo sendo uma má pessoa, a velha não deixava de ser um ser humano.Livro maravilhoso."
"1484",1483,"Dianah","This is one of the finest examples of criminal psychology ever explored. With enormous scope, Dostoyevsky dissects poverty, rationalization, the criminal mind, guilt, confession, religion and redemption. It also provides an exquisite look at overwhelming paranoia.

And how everything is entwine to one another.What do I think of this book? It's a masterpiece. Dostoevsky managed to bring out the mental anguish face by Raskolnikov when he was contemplating the murder and after the murder. Very dangerous book also as the reasons for the murder which seems so wrong could be viewed in another point which makes the murder seems alright.Definitely a book for a serious reader. "

"1491",1490,"Travis of NNY","This was the first Dostoyevsky I read a few years ago. I have read several since then and decided it was time for a re-read. This time around it absolutely solidifies itself as my all time favorite of his works followed probably second by The Idiot and third Brothers K. I'm sure this won't be the last time I pick this book up. The journey into the mind of a maniac. The game of cat and mouse between Raskolnikov and Petrovich. The torment Rodion goes through mentally and physically within himself living with the consequences of murder. Dostoyevsky always does so well in portraying the wretchedness of man and his struggles. He tends to favor characters of the poor, desolute and depraved. I think these common and even base characters versus the upper class and rich characters often used by Tolstoy is why I greatly prefer Dostoyevsky's work. "

However, it’s far from being a tangible one, it’s an intangible punishment which is ever severer than tangible.The depiction of the psychological conflict of Raskolnikoff was written in a way makes you live it as if it’s in your mind. While reading Rodia's speech, you can feel the disturbance & clash of thoughts in his mind & his attempt to convince himself he’s not guilty & his deed was normal.The feeling of uneasy and continual perplexity was the punishment not the jail.The writer could depict a state that we all pass through, when we’re perplexed with many thoughts in our mind and reach a state where we would wish to cut our head down to get rid of those tortured thoughts I empathized with Rodia and while reading, I I wished he would denounce himself ASAP , in some parts, just to release himself from his confusion.

"1497",1496,"Tucker","When I searched for this book by title two John Grisham books preceded it. This is a problem. Modern Pulp and serial writing probably can't touch this. I've never been one for page turners. I'm a slow reader and I read this within a week. The most fun book I've read."
"1498",1497,"Vidya","I could not put this book down from the moment I started it. It's amazing how intimidated I was all throughout my high school years by the size of the volumes I would see of C & P when I was totally judging this book by the cover [I'm sorry, I had to]. Dostoyevsky masterfully weaves character development with cliff hangers, creating a depiction of St. Petersburg that almost makes the city another character of the novel. I went further and sought out filmed interpretations, like BBC's Crime and Punishment 3 part TV mini- series. Starring John Hurt [who you may know from the film version of 1984], "
"1499",1498,"Jo","This is my third go round with Crime and Punishment. I avoided it for years because everybody told me I MUST read it, and I'd LOVE it etc etc. Being stubborn, I decided not to pick it up at all. When I first read it, I was 26, which is maybe too old for your first Dostoevsky encounter. Anyway, I LOVED it, if you haven't read it yet, you absolutely MUST, etc etc. Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov is a young student, except that he's dropped out of college, who is living in a crappy neighbourhood in Petersburg and getting poorer and more and more miserable. He sits around brooding, and as a result of the poverty and/or the brooding, depending on how you read his motivations, he decides to kill an old pawnbroker. This is not a spoiler - it's the point of the book. Things get out of hand, his plot doesn't come off the way he'd hoped, he gets ill, he almost gets caught, he almost gets himself caught on purpose, goes round the town blathering to himself and looking suspicious. There are various - well, I suppose you'd say sub-plots, but because of the way it unfolds, every character seems centre stage while they're there. Rodya's mother and sister (Dunya) turn up from the provinces, with the sister's rich but nasty fiancé. Rodya meets a hopeless old drunk, once a respectable civil servant, who has been reduced to living off his 18 year old daughter's prostitution income. (The 18 year old girl is Sonya, who ends up being Rodya's love interest.) Rodya's friend is related to the man investigating the murder. The sister's old employer, a truly horrible man, turns up and becomes enmeshed in the plot.I don't know how he does it, but it reads really really vividly - honestly, it's like you're right there, even though it's 150 years ago in a faraway country. And this isn't always a good thing - I was dreading reading this again, because I knew bits of it were really distressing. There are various horribly upsetting scenes of child abuse and animal abuse as well as, of course, several violent deaths; also implied but still sickeningly vivid child sexual abuse and suicide. Loads of poverty, degradation, madness and forced prostitution. I find the scene in which you see Sonya's siblings for the last time particularly difficult to read - felt like it would never end, not in a boring way, but in the way you can't take your eyes off some disaster unfolding in real time but feeling like slow motion. Also the various dreams - I was muttering to myself, 'it's just a dream, it's just a dream', but it still felt horrible. In theory, Rodya has a rationale for his murder - he has written an article in which he explains his theory that there are some geniuses, amazingly special people, for whom everything is permitted, and to whom normal rules do not apply. In the end, he renounces his theory, but long before, as in from the first few pages, it becomes clear that his theory is not what is driving his actions. Similarly, one of the characters is always spouting various radical theories which are shown to have laughably little to do with any of the character's real lives. Here he is on Sonya's prostitution:""As to Sofya Semyonovna personally, I regard her action as a vigorous protest against the organisation of society, and I respect her deeply for it; I rejoice indeed when I look at her!""To which another character witheringly replies:""I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings.""I've never read anything about the book, as opposed to just reading the book itself, but I've always assumed that the contrast between high-flown theories and the utter misery of his characters' lives was somehow Dostoevsky's point. (And I'm vaguely interested to see that that's still the case, in that I've come across various arguments about the liberating and anti-bourgeois nature of sex work which run up hard against the hard reality of the job.)Anyway, it's an amazing book, and you MUST read it! You'll LOVE it! No, really you should read it if you don't mind feeling like you're there, with 'there' being a terrible place. I know people sometimes say that they get put off because Rodya's such a tool, but honestly, I think Rodya's meant to be a tool. Nobody feels sympathetic towards him; he's basically awful. Don't read it for him - read it for Dunya and Sonya!"

Not fair. Pe de altă parte îmi pare rău că s-a terminat aici, mă atașasem de Raskolnikov într-un fel ciudat și chiar îmi plăcea de el. Apoi da, de acord, oamenii care comit crime sunt împărțiți în cei care sunt omorâți la rândul lor pentru că ""we kill people who kill people because killing people is wrong"" și oameni care sunt aplaudați de o lume întreagă fiindcă crimele lor au fost de folos societății, și în cazul cărora nu se mai ia în considerare săvârșirea unei acțiuni împotriva firii. Not fair x2. Poate dacă Raskolnikov ar fi fost în alte facultăți mintale și s-ar fi reușit pe plan profesional, devenind un Napoleon, uciderea babei nevinovate ar fi rămas un eveniment înțeles, poate chiar lăudat împreună cu tăria lui de caracter. Prin toată asta nu am sesizat decât că oamenii sunt proști și că nu merită să te zbați ca să te faci înțeles, ei vor reacționa oricum în funcție de principiile lor sau de gândirea curentă.

Sebbene fosse una rilettura è stato ugualmente lungo arrivare alla fine, il mio professore di filosofia al liceo soleva dirci: ""Leggete Dostoevskij un'estate e crescerete"". E crescere non è mai una faccenda breve, in effetti per me resta uno dei romanzi assolutamente da leggere nella vita. La vicenda è delle più semplici: un omicidio, il senso di colpa, la redenzione. Ma il modo in cui tutto è sviluppato non ha paragoni, la psicologia di ogni personaggio è un piccolo capolavoro che si svela come una matrioska.

"1504",1503,"Antonomasia","Penguin edition, translated by Oliver ReadyI discovered this new version via a best books of 2014 article. (They work for some of us...) Seeing a comment by a translator from Russian, it sounded like this was what I’d been looking for: At last we have a translation that brings out the wild humour and vitality of the original. A.N. Wilson, who also chose this as a ‘Book of the Year’, is right to call it a ‘truly great translation’. I'd heard already that Russians often describe Dostoevsky as humorous, but this never came through in any of the five or so translations of which I’d read early pages. Just over a year ago, I ended up with a second hand copy of Jessie Coulson’s OUP C&P because it flowed better than the Pevear & Volokhonsky, and cost £1.49, but I still wasn’t convinced that it was the right one. And for years earlier, I’d had a copy of the McDuff, which I’d eventually got rid of without reading.Oliver Ready’s Note on [this] Translation says The most widely read translations of Crime and Punishment have tended, in my view, towards a polish, and therefore tameness, absent from Dostoevsky’s text (effects gained in large part by judicious trimming or padding); or else they have clung so closely to the Russian that the spell cast by the original is periodically broken by jarring literalism, and the author’s peculiarities of style, smoothed over in other translations, are made odder still. Well, exactly. When I started War & Peace, I read dozens of articles for and against the literalism of Pevear & Volkhonsky. I like the arguments against absolute literalism. I fell into reading their translation: it seemed livelier than Edmonds, and the Briggs, which I preferred, isn’t available as an ebook, plus I just wanted to know what people were talking about. The double entendres (including liberal use of the word ‘entering’) which P&V actually fought against British editors to retain, were always distracting. In most of the relevant scenes, they set a porn version running in my head in parallel with Tolstoy’s story. (Some bits of which are more memorable than the real scene…) Unconscious innuendo might have a place alongside old-fashioned, out-of-touch grandeur, a fair representation of someone who doesn’t know a vulgar meaning of what they’re saying - which fits perfectly well with the idea of Tolstoy. But a grubby story like Crime and Punishment should surely mean what it says.This month, reading, and reading reviews of, recent Russian-language comic novel The Good Life Elsewhere has given me a stronger sense of how a clumsy, cluttered wordiness in English is a result of near-literal translation from Russian, and how it can detract from humour. The concept is funny, but something seems off-centre and it means no actual-lol. When I looked again at the preview of P&V’s Crime & Punishment, I saw exactly that kind of word-clutter. Ready communicates the same things as they do, in the pages I read in parallel, but his sentences have a more elegant construction, a hint of dry wit; subtly rather British, perhaps, though the text doesn’t feel entirely anglicised. The narrative fairly gallops along with an almost manic energy (not so much that it isn’t also thoughtful) – it was compulsive reading and I didn’t really want to stop once I’d read the sample, delighted also to have been seized with enthusiasm for a book that had been hanging around my collection in various forms for the best part of fifteen years. When I finished it, I segued straight to In Siberia by Colin Thubron, whose flowery prose was much slower to read and showed just what immediacy and simple clarity Dostoevsky-via-Ready had. If you value a translation that’s well written and enjoyable in and of itself, I’d certainly recommend this one over P&V.The notes are excellent. Ready explains many word choices, underlying Russian meanings, and their significance to the story: very satisfying and never boring. There is lots on the historical and philosophical context and background academic scholarship. Anonymised place names are explained – though as usual I’ll lament the lack of maps in a novel: if you haven’t been to St Petersburg, these can’t be placed without putting down the book. Only a handful of notes seem superfluous for a fairly well-educated reader who is nonetheless unfamiliar with recent scholarship on Dostoevsky; all of those translate elementary phrases of French and German.Some time last year, I noticed what appeared to be the books that the most Goodreads friends had read which I hadn’t. Don’t think I made a note of them all, but at the top were Lolita (read last autumn) and Crime and Punishment. (Karamazov isn’t far behind. You lot prefer Dostoyevsky over Tolstoy, more than average for the site, and now I can see why.) The people in my feed really don’t need another review of the book in general. But I write these things at least as much for the sake of remembering as telling. At first the book was incredibly familiar. I knew I hadn’t read more than a chapter before – presumably it was instead because this is an ur-text. Raskolnikov may have had his literary antecedents, but surely he’s the granddad of all those usually criminal, sometimes merely a bit dodgy, unreliable narrators that are arguably a subgenre to themselves in twentieth century-and-later English language fiction: John Self, Patrick Bateman, Humbert himself, and Alfie being the first well-known ones who spring to mind. (Not to mention the starving artists and existentialists teetering on the brink in Hamsun, Camus, Sartre etc etc.) Raskolnikov's opinions (and the scene of cruelty to horses as he falls into madness) prefigure Nietzsche. Having read GR posts by people who generally come across as calm, who yet felt that Raskolnikov had got under their skin, I was apprehensive about where this might take me. I didn’t want to feel again like I had when reading Money (which needed a lot of breaks) or Lolita (which I read much of whilst sunbathing outside – when it wasn’t quite warm enough – because visual and physical awareness of self would help displace my consciousness into non-narrating characters. At my age, that’s obviously Charlotte.) But third-person narrative, with scenes entirely between other characters, saves me from feeling half possessed. We come up for air with long breaks from Raskolnikov’s mind, and the book is far more interesting for the number of other characters it contains. But we’re still stuck inside the close, humid world of white nights in the slums of St Petersburg. It invited immersive reading, stewing in bed or sofa as crockery, cartons and cups piled up around. The third person made it easier to disentangle what makes such narrators feel contagious: Raskolnikov’s nerves are universal, the pressure of some impending but unfixed deadline; most readers can presumably remember times when they’ve felt nervous as that – but it wasn’t because they killed anyone. Sometimes, when he's concerned with family problems, it's as if he's forgotten what happened, what he did - from less serious bad things at least, this kind of denial seems so accurate, something that novels don't often get into - it's not that he isn't troubled, it just isn't there for a while. Though what I often got most caught up in was the outlook of several other characters who just assume he needs to get better and sort himself out, have a decent meal and pay off his debts... then like the bombshell of a drunk remembering what they did the night before, back into Raskolnikov's mind and the enormity and horror of the murder. Classics are generally classics because they’re universal, but it’s a long time since I found any nineteenth century novel this pertinent. (And if I ever did I can’t remember which one.)Some of it’s in the smaller things: the to-ing and fro-ing between what are essentially bedsits, half living in other people’s houses, visitors forever turning up, feels terribly similar to [post]university life over a hundred years later. A chord that won’t strike the hardier among you, but how often characters are ill (with fevers, mostly)*. I felt at home in a world where other people also say “Now of all times I’d have preferred to be well,” where it’s evidently a regular consideration. And maybe novels set amongst poorer people more easily seem ‘relevant’ and ‘universal’ than stories of aristocrats. Mostly the significance, though, is in the big philosophical questions. These days aspiring political leaders would not be respected for having killed people – that’s a difference from Raskolnikov’s idealisation of Napoleon. But his ‘stepping over’ idea, to what extent some form of greatness negates damage done, does still seem to matter in debates about the relevance of artists’ lives to their work. And I know I accept things from a few people I consider hugely creatively talented that I wouldn’t from those who aren’t, and that others don’t make exceptions. The biggest question is about the causes of crime. Notes indicate that Dostoevsky was philosophically opposed to those who considered all crime to be prompted by the environment; at that point in history it sounds as if this meant external factors such as poverty. The environment is now understood to be more entangled with the individual, via upbringing and [epi]genetics, and points like the very high incidence of mental illness in prisoners, which makes this story all the more complex – as a case study it still works because Raskolnikov’s character and the question of his responsibility is not straightforward and can be seen through the lens of whatever current society. As regards the very end (view spoiler)[whilst I don’t know about this point WRT serious violent criminals, I think it’s excellent that Raskolnikov’s sense of feeling and empathy starts to kick in as he gets a little older. Plenty of people are rigidly elitist and unfeeling to those unlike them in their late teens and early twenties, and become much more “human/e” as they grow up. Much popular comment seems to think that it’s set for life, but I’ve seen people change to one degree or another like this, (not to mention examples in textbooks) and it’s evident it’s a spectrum not a binary. Dostoevsky shows Raskolnikov as someone with the potential to grow out of it to some unknown extent, but he also acknowledges that some people don’t really, in the character of Luzhin. Svidrigailov seems to have placed the orphans in a vulnerable position, but he has tried to make some amends and has been haunted by his victims. Dunce point: did he really kill himself? And not shoot ‘Achilles’, dress him up in his clothes and run away to America? (hide spoiler)]Crime and Punishment is remarkably free from that perennial irritant in nineteenth century novels, the generalisation: old men do this, young women think that etc. I only noticed four in the entire book, and only one of those was dodgy to our eyes (a long-winded clause essentially saying ‘all Jews look miserable’). Russians ""have an exceptional propensity for the fantastical and the disorderly""? His characters do, anyway. I like to think that Dostoevsky’s unusually broad and harrowing life experience made him see there was too much variety among human beings to warrant the usual Victorian upper/middle-class generalisations pronounced from on high. (Of the remaining two, one seems impossible to argue with: like children who, after a good long cry, are finally beginning to cheer up, but could easily start sobbing again at a moment’s notice. And the other seems so obviously, amusingly, a local observation not marked as such: Katya drained the glass in one go – without a break, in twenty gulps, as women do. Having downed plenty of drinks – when younger to show off, later merely through thirst – I feel no objection, only wonder whether it would take a starving singer, who must have good breath control, as many as twenty to drain a pint or similar).Everyone mentions Raskolnikov, but I’d never heard anyone allude to his sister Dunya, and how much she rocks. In War & Peace female characters appeared to have a bit more licence than those in its British contemporaries. Still, I was amazed that the women of Part 4 chapter II were written by a genuine nineteenth century novelist. (view spoiler)[ Later, near the end where it has moments of turning into an adventure novel in the scene with Svidrigailov, I saw her as a prototype of the Russian Bond Girl (hide spoiler)]. There were so many little things familiar about their mother, Pulkheria, that I could easily imagine her as an extra aunt. Generally, I had not been led to believe that there were many likeable characters in Crime & Punishment, but there are – Razhumikin, too. Raskolnikov on his own could get exasperating at times (not as exasperated as he himself felt); yet whenever he was in conversation with anyone else the story became fascinating again, and I always wanted to know what was going to happen to everyone else. Not that there aren’t a few possible faults to pick. Some seem a result of writing for serialisation. (view spoiler)[Luzhin and Svidrigailov could have had more disparate roles in the second half. I wondered if in the original serialisation, Dostoevsky was trying to reprise and amplify popular plotlines with Luzhin as antagonist, as there were a few too many similarities in what Svidrigailov did later on. Even though his denouement was enormous fun. Right now it also seems particularly contemporary to have as villains rich men who exploited impoverished children and teenagers.  (hide spoiler)] Investigator Petrovich was perhaps too mad and rambling in conversation, too strange and fantastical in his actions, but that’s when compared with modern fictional detectives. There are bits which are existential gritty realist and philosophical, and others pulpier. Sonya has, of all the characters, aged least well: a cross between Little Nell and the hooker with a heart of gold, she doesn’t ring true to the modern reader. I read a lot of the big English nineteenth century classics in my teens, and for all that I might see them differently now, there has always been that feeling of having got something basically done. All the references in this volume make me aware of a huge gap in not having read the Russians which I didn’t think that significant before – if only they were all as compelling as this translation, they would be nothing but a joy to discover. *There was a bit in some novel I read as a teenager in which a heroine asks “why does Juliet never have a cold?” and similar re . other well known characters."

"1510",1509,"Kip Lowery","Crime and Punishment is a comprehensive and troubling look into the dark mind of a Russian intellectual who murders an old pawn broker and her sister. Money was only his secondary motive for the crime. His first premise was to test his idea whether extraordinary men have a right to transgress the law, and whether he is that extraordinary type of man. In the novel, Dostoevsky explores the paradox of the human condition in live action, between abject wretchedness and merciful kindness. Raskolnikov is a soul torn between the two, a base contradiction, alienated from society, family, even from himself. In his psyche, he is forced to navigate between the terror of guilt and police, rejecting friends, providing charity unthinkingly, all the while constantly irritated by both his conscience and self-justification. At times it made my heart sick to read, but this is a journey from darkness to light, from pride to humiliation, from isolation to love and ultimately salvation."

And moreover, being a classic and all, and that too Russian, I assumed it would be a very heavy read.All my perceptions were shattered page after page. And that too quickly, beautifully. This is easily one of the most smoothest prose I've ever read. The poverty, the city din, the dark dirtiness of the mind and the street is wonderfully emphasized line after line.

With the major life changes I was also experiencing during that summer i also needed a book that would effectively remove me from my present reality and almost like a magnum of vodka drown my senses and drown out all the noise in my life. This book did that for me. I had it with me poolside all summer long, and it managed to retain the smell of chlorine and coconut scented sunblock lotion between the pages by the end of the summer. Sorry I'm not writing my review of the book here, just wanted to reflect and share what I felt and how the experience of reading this book was like for me that summer. "
"1543",1542,"Chin Jian xiong","Before you think this book is a philosophical wall of text that everyone reads just to add to their literary street cred (my initial reason for reading it), keep in your mind that as demented as Raskolnikov is, as much as he rants about his Nietzsche-an ideals and as much as Dostoyevsky wants to smush your face into his philosophies, this is actually a brilliant melodramatic romantic soap operatic tense mystery. Somewhere, deep inside all that fluff and insanity, is the story of a man, a man who loves his family, a man who although flawed (who happens to think that carving the face of a woman in with an axe can propel him to a superman-like status) is probably a beautiful human being.But I have to admit, that ending came out of nowhere. And Ponfiry is a goddamn badass.20/04/13 - Read David Foster Wallace's review on Dostoevsky's biographies. It will make you look at Dostoevsky in a completely different light altogether (the review, haven't read the biographies)."

""The more we intellectualize, the more imprisoned we become.""
This is my first read of Dostoevsky and I am intrigued.I loved the read and it's the best book I have I ever read so far!! How can someone create such an authentic picture of human psychology of emotions I felt as if I was feeling everything myself....Book is about a highly intellectual person Raskolnikov and the crime he commits in delirium.... he is a genius, a mastermind who has every single explanation for justifying his vileness.
""To go wrong in one's own way is better than to go right in someone else's.""
Dostoevsky's characters are so exaggerated that they seem to shoot their emotions at each other all the time.He has not left grasp of a single emotion throughout his way.Crime is committed, if a man has consciously done it then he has to suffer whole life punishment in the form of pain and suffering which is inevitable.It will be harder for a large intellect and deep heart.
""Nothing in this world is harder than speaking the truth, nothing is easier than flattery""
In this world, there are hardly a few individuals who has the courage to follow what they think is right and true.
""Taking a new step and uttering a new word is what people fear the most""
This book has really enlarged my senses and perspective towards the way we look at the world, every single detail of it......Looking forward to reading other books of Dostoevsky and definitely this one more round. :-)"

"1552",1551,"Harsha Gurnani","A brilliant tale. Of course, the plot, its execution and the pace of the story all do it merit. However, what keeps the reader hooked, absolutely and resolutely hooked, is the whole idea, the genius of Dostoevsky. How deeply he understands the human nature, the beliefs and inclinations, the fantasies we all harbour perhaps, and yet he presents it as extraordinary, as something entirely new. The narrative is raw, and it will make you raw; the misery and poverty will make your heart churn, make you shed tears, others like Luzhin will evoke contempt and disdain and curses, there is compassion despite suffering, there are radical ideas about the duties of man and society, and amongst all that, the question of right and wrong - right by law, right by conscience, right by intellect, or simply right according to history books. In the end, I was impressed not only by the story but also by the character and the intellect of the author himself. How I would have loved to have had the chance to meet him, or listen to him! But I must be content with reading his works. I would recommend this book without hesitation to anyone and everyone who enjoys reading, for this is without doubt (in my head) amongst the best literary pieces man has ever created."

"1555",1554,"Travis Struchen","4/20/09 (SPOILER ALERT)Fyodor Dostoyevsky - Crime and Punishmentdate written 185819th century, author spent time in prison (4 years) and some year in military afterwards. it was after this time period that he wained in and out of delerium and struggle with hypochondria. The protagonist of the story is Raskolnikov an earlier twenty something university dropout. he lives in a small dungoen of a room in st. petersburg and comes up a strange theory: that brilliant men are above the law and step over it easily on their way to greatness. it is because of this idea and his self conceded vision that he is destined to be a brilliant man that he decides to test his theory and kill an old women of which he owes money. his methodical plan is executed without leaving any evidence and only his paranoia betrays him. A crafty police detective petrovitch clues into his physchological guilt and plays tricks on him to push him over the edge and make him repent. he even gets someone to follow him around and then confront him and call him a murderer saying that he knows he did it. The subplot exists in the familial ties between his sister and mother. they come to st. petersburg towards the end of the plot with his sister's contriving groom who ends up to be shown for the ass he is by raskolnikov during sofya's father's funeral. the frail peasant girl turned prostitute is the first person to whom raskolnikov shares his ugly secrets. (later the same day to his sister Dounia) In the end Raskolnikov confesses to his crime and spends 8 years in siberia for his crime. he lets down his guard about a year after his incarceration and confesses his love for sofya who followed him to siberia. his sister dounia gets married to raskolnikov's best friend an former classmate Razumihin. he was spared a life sentence based on his agitated state and not even caring about hte money he stole from his victims. (he actually kills the old women's younger sister as well when surprised by her appearance)"
"1556",1555,"Katelin","I really liked this book. It was not a walk in the park, but it was definitely worth reading. It's one of those books that you should read in your lifetime. Sometimes it was hard to keep the characters straight because they're all called different names in the book, but it was a really good book and good story line. Very worthwhile reading. I literally cried during the end of this book. It was that good. I would definitely read this book again."
"1557",1556,"Randy Reus"," One of the many reasons Dostoevsky is my favorite author is that he can argue against his own beliefs just as strongly as he argues for his own side. Ivan Karamozov makes such a convincing case against God in The Brothers Karamazov that many people feel Dostoevsky must have been a closet atheist himself, despite his avowed faith. In the introduction to my edition of Crime and Punishment, Joseph Brodsky is quoted as saying that Dostoevsky subscribed to the classical dictum that 'before you come forth with your argument, however right or righteous you may feel, you have to list all the arguments of the opposite side.' I'm going to take this same approach, and list all the reasons you shouldn't like Crime and Punishment.	Plotwise, it's a bit of a sprawling mess. While the main story centers on Raskolnikov's failed attempt to prove himself a Superman by moving himself beyond good and evil (I love that he refutes every Nietzschean argument years before Nietzsche ever made them), there are way too many sidetracks along the way. An editor would have probably cut most of Marmeladov's opening monologue, the romance between Razumikhin and Dunya, and possibly even Svidrigailov entirely. None of these are vital to the point of Raskolnikov's battle with his conscience, and in fact distract the reader from this central point again and again.	The murder happens before the motive is fully explained. We don't find out Raskolnikov has written an article expounding his views on the right of the 'superior' individual to be above the law until much later in the book. Logic would dictate that we would be much more engrossed in the crime if we knew his reasons for committing it. As it is written, he comes across just looking like an inept criminal until we later find out his twisted reasoning.	There are entirely too many coincidences in Crime and Punishment. Svidrigalov just happens to rent a room right next to Sonya, and also happens to be in when Raskolnikov confesses to her. Zamyotov, the police clerk, somehow is a good friend of Razumikhin. Raskolnikov is at the market right when Lizaveta Ivanovna tells someone she'll be out of her sister's house the next evening at seven,leaving his intended victim alone. And, Sonya and Lizaveta are friends. St. Petersburg must have been a very small town!	Despite these 'shortcomings', Crime and Punishment remains one of the all-time greats. It's a masterful look inside the mind of not just a criminal, but a man who truly believes his crime will set him apart from humanity as one of the few who are bold enough to step above law and morality. He quickly learns that this is not the case at all. His ineptitude (killing her sister as well, leaving most of the money in the apartment, and never profiting from the robbery at all) immediately shows him he is no Superman. And, afterwords, his mounting sense of guilt and despair prove to him that not only did he not live up to his theory, but that this theory was completely wrong as well.	Also, the repetitive nature of Raskolnikov's dreams, his walks through St. Petersburg, interviews with the police, and discussions with Sonya only serve to bring us into his fractured state of mind after the crime. And, while some of the side-stories are the result of Dostoevsky blending two novels (one with the working title of The Drunkards) into one, others probably result from his usual habit of writing a serialized novel so close to deadline that the first chapters were in print before he had finished writing the last. This meant that even if he later decided a character or scene introduced early on wasn't integral to the plot, he couldn't just cut it out, since it was already in print.	Again, this is one of my all-time favorite books from one of my all-time favorite writers. It is amazing how much tension is built into a novel where we know who the murderer is right from the start. It's not a ""who-done-it"", it's a ""can-he-get-away-with-it."" And not from outside sources - even though Porfiry Petrovich (my favorite fictional detective) knows he did it from the start, there isn't any evidence to convict him. And Porfiry lets Raskonikov know this, leaving it to his conscience to do the rest. And to Dostoevsky, conscience is proof that God exists. For, ""without God, everything is permitted."" "

"1564",1563,"Caitlin","Dostoevsky is a very different writer than Tolstoy. He focuses on the dark side of the Russian experience, with it's dirty cities and intense, inescapable poverty that leads good people to despeate acts. The writing in this book is oppressive, and completely believable. Only in the last few pages does a look toward redemption and a light at the end of the tunnel shine through. For all that, the text is rich and has a lot to offer those who can tolerate the darkness of some thoughts and actions."
"1565",1564,"Carl","Okay, I know, I know, many great readers hate hate hate this old-style novel for its indulgences, its ruminations, its many nicknames, and its lack of action. But it is simply one of the most adult novels I have ever read: even after six or seven reads, the novel never fails to dazzle me with how it develops its deep and nuanced psychological portrait. It's unbelievably mature and reverent, even to someone (like me) who does not share the author's rigid faith. Maybe not a novel to revel in, but it's certainly one to appreciate: this is an all-time top-five for me, even though I recommend it far less often than I do my other favorites.The essays in the back of this Norton edition are really fascinating too. Don't miss the Mochulsky (I think that's it) about how this could be conceived as a tragedy in five acts (FD's parts II-VI) sandwiched by a prologue (FD's part I) and epilogue (FD's epilogue). The fragments from the Soviet Union's state curriculum and how this book was taught over the years also catch my eye every time.I need to read another translation someday.

For me Crime and Punishment was one of those books, but after finishing it I can now say that this is one of my new favourites and I can see why this has lasted the test of time and is indeed a classic novel!Don't get me wrong, this is not an easy read in any sense. It is very intense, and has long (sometimes unnecessary) dialogs between characters, and I would find myself putting the book down for a week or two and coming back to it.Still, I could very easily comeback to it, and I found the further I got into the book the harder it was becoming to put it down, no Rodion is not a particularly likeable person on the surface, but that to me is what makes this even better. You still become intrigued to Rodion's fate and mental state. Some of the reviews on here have refered to Rodion as being mad, but I think the point Fyodor Dostoyevsky is trying to make is that an act such as murder and the guilt that follows is what makes you mad. This isn't really about spirituality either, as a psychology student I see this as a great insight into the human conscience and the deterioration of sanity. "
"1582",1581,"Dina","Am I the only one who liked it more than The Brothers Karamazov? I've been thinking it may have been because this was my first experience with Dostoevsky but I'm undecided.

"1591",1590,"Angie","This book was an incredible re-read for me. A chilling insight into the inner turmoil of a delirious and insecure but brilliant young man. One's inability to warm to the character of Raskolnikov, our secretive murderer who guilt weighs upon him, is contrary to those around him who seemingly adore him. He can do no wrong. The fact that we, the readers, know he is a loathsome and cold blooded murderer, feel no sympathy for him, then makes for the most interesting sections of the book; when we see him attempt to live with his guilt, and swither from his own inner revulsion one minute to his delusional high opinions of himself and his 'right' to stamp out someone insignificant who had more in life than he did. He views himself as a genius and that this step was something small and unimportant in the scheme of his great life. A terrifying childhood nightmare told near the start of this is one of the most grueling and disturbing passages in the whole book and the murder only comes along after this so I took the character of Raskolnikov to be already at the lowest ebb of his life, in complete poverty, ignored when he felt he should be exalted, due to his intellect. The other characters in the book were interesting from the businessman Svidrigailov who stalks his sister and his surprising demise to the cunning methods of the policeman Porfiry who 'plays' with Raskolnikov and causes his paranoia to be his own downfall.Dostoevsky in undoubtedly one of the greatest writers ever in terms of uncovering and exposing human nature in all its glory and equally in its horror. Told in a simple uncomplicated style, this is a truly great and compelling novel and one which I feel most would read and enjoy. "
"1592",1591,"Joshua Christensen","This is a marvelous book that everyone interested in crime should read. It is truly a masterpiece. "
"1593",1592,"Shannon","This is my FAVORITE book. I find myself seeing scenes from the book play out in movies; tv shows; and life on a pretty regular basis. What a wonderful depiction of the struggle between ""good"" and ""evil"" we struggle within ourselves."
"1594",1593,"Tim","This has to be my favorite book of all time. One of the reasons I love it is the tremendous depth of Raskolnikov's character. He wants so desperately to believe that he is superior to other humans and that he needs no moral restrictions, but he knows that he isn't. He wants to believe that he did nothing wrong, but through his actions it is clear that he knows he needs to make amends somehow. Another reason I love it is the themes of rebirth and renewal, especially with the biblical story of Lazarus. All in all, it is a wonderful story about spiritual death and rebirth, and the many ups and downs along the way."
"1595",1594,"Danielle","This is a book I will never forget. I remember specific parts of it at the weirdest times...his writing will stick with you. The main character, tortured by his guilt, is all of us. "
"1596",1595,"Hugo Malcato","É verdade que demorei muito tempo a ler o livro, mas trata-se de um clássico imperdível e recomendado para qualquer leitor.Raskolnikov é a personagem principal deste enredo que passar por um enorme ensaio da condição humana, poder e sofrimento, recompensa, grandeza, castigo e inutilidade.Um ""vaivem"" de contratempos e avanços, numa roda vida daquilo que é a vida humana. "
"1597",1596,"J.L. Whitaker","The classics are called classic for a reason. This is one of those. This is the second Russian novel I've read in the past year. C&P is a psychological drama of the first order. Much has been written about this book, so I won't bore you with my humble attempt, and just leave it as - it's a classic.As a writer, I felt the presentation of the war in Raskolnikov's mind after his deed was one of the most gripping I've ever read. The philosophical aspect was disturbing - when can a murderer feel justified in doing so? Perhaps it was the sign of the times for this to be the focus of Dostoyevsky's story - Russia in the beginnings of revolution, questioning the power of the powerful. Definitely a book to put on your reading bucket list."
"1598",1597,"Esther"," The long lasting consequences of a short almost instinctive crime drove me off into the land of insanity. The way that Raskolnikov overthinks situations and perceives things to an extreme level due to his  suspicions of the suspicions  of Petrovich and Zamyotov have about his involvement in the crime.  The parallelism between the mental guilt of Raskolnikov and that of Svidrigailov's was really interesting. On one of the spectrum, Raskolnikov was overcome with guilt over the murders while on the other side Svidrigailov was in a way...freed from his bond. However in the end, the instability of Svidrigailov's behavior consumes his unconscious moral attitude expressed through the dream he had of the five-year old girl. I especially enjoyed Dostoyevsky's style of writing from the perspective of a ""criminal""; it allowed me to understand the inner wiring of the human brain and process of returning back to sanity on a  whole new level."
"1599",1598,"Paulgrub","I'm not sure what to say about this book that hasn't already been said. A stone cold classic, it earns every plaudit ever given it. I'll throw in my two cents by saying that the next book I read after C&P was a book of F. Scott Fitzgerald short stories. I am a huge fan of FSF and I really enjoyed the book but while reading it I couldn't escape the feeling that what I was dealing with something much lighter. I missed reading C&P, I missed the struggle of it. I want to read other authors this summer but I don't know how I can avoid going straight to another Dostoevsky novel."
"1600",1599,"Roberta Cullen","Excelente, atrapante, los personajes tan bien delimitados, las descripciones tan bien realizadas que hasta puedes sentir el olor de las cosas... Algo de la trama me recordo el cuento El corazon delator de Allan Poe, muy recomendable."
"1601",1600,"Luke","I hesitated to give it 5 stars because there are some things that bug me about this book, but oh boy is this a good book. I'm no fanatic about Russian literature, but then it's been 10 years since I my first reading. My second reading--accomplished largely over the course of 2 or 3 very early morning reading sessions--was absolutely thrilling. It's a book meant to be devoured, and it's just so full of everything. The structure is fascinating, the characters are great, especially the vilest ones (reminded me of Dickens in this way, except really really dark). And the psychology is like lighting on the page. The police inspector was my favorite character, altho I really liked the scenes where Luzhin started some awful sh*t and then got called out on it. It's nice too to read a ""great"" book that doesn't devour one's own self, the way 2666 did (of course there's really no comparison here at all...let me just say it was nice to read something brilliant and original and still fresh after 140 years.)"
"1602",1601,"Zac O hArgadain","Wow! This book is amazing- I feel like it could be a great Lenten read if time is made for it. Particularly with the end's turning of focus towards Resurrection. I have to confess that I lost interest around the halfway point for months, but once I hit part three it was like a steamroller. A deep look into the human spirit, the Gospel, sin and identity."
"1603",1602,"Thalia","""If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be his punishment- as well as the prison"" Crime and Punishment was a very different literary experience for me, it was the first novel that I found myself completely immersed into the psychology of the protagonist not knowing what to expect next.I felt as if I were there in place of Raskolnikov experiencing his tortured emotions of feverish despair and trapped in his own maddening thoughts of the grave crime he had committed. The novel reflected several themes that are still prevalent in today's society- the varying motives of criminals, poverty and religion which makes it still relevant. He had suffered for almost the entirety of the novel and is only actually showing hints of redemption and reflecting a renewal of spirit during his later years of his sentence. I honestly can not express in words how much this novel has created an impact on me, and no doubt has affected other readers as it is quite relatable. We are drawn in by the apt use of language by Dostoevsky channeling his own tortured experiences relating human suffering be it economical, pathological or emotional. He also gives us hope at the end of the novel, that sometimes we just need to start again despite what has transpired in our lives. I am greatly impressed by Dostoevsky and I look forward to reading his other notable works, The Brothers Karamazov and Notes from the Underground. "
"1604",1603,"Ellie Wang","Def one of my favs, i finished in 3 days, even tho it has like 700 pages(in Chinese version), really hard to put down, and literally haunted me in dreams for quite a while, truly a masterpiece, also my favourite of all his books."
"1605",1604,"Entropy","Actual rating is like 4.59 because of the ending.I didn't think it would be so easy to read, but it was. I don't know if I got the entire anti-Russian nihilism, but I've read a bit of Camus so the ideas did not fly completely over my head.It was a nice story, nice progression, great names that I finally remember characters after the first 1/3 of the book.The ending. Why. Why did you have to kill my poor Raskolnikov like that. (not literally kill)Could have skipped the epilogue, I think.The character of Raskolnikov was well written, and I found his inner monologues interesting instead of having to trudge through them. Just how the character was so extreme, it was thought provoking to see how he, our Napoleon, would react to such a crime.I feel like I know a lot more about Russian culture at that time, just what people communicate about is so interesting. I know that characters do not really talk about their philosophical ideas for 6 pages and on, no its more like how religious everyone was, how people would debate ideals for fun.This was my first Dostoyevsky book, I'm currently reading Brothers Karamazov, which seems to run faster, and keeps my attention for longer. I got through 1/4 on the first day, so it is pretty quick, and I find a lot of the characters way more interesting. (Some of the names are the same, and that confused me for a second, see 'Katerina Ivanova' or 'Lizabeta', a name Dostoyevsky seems to dislike)On a side note, can someone tell me how much a ruble would have been at that time?"
"1606",1605,"Yahya Han","This book is easy to read and clearly understandable. The reason for this is that Dostoevsky is an extremely good writer and his language is addressed to all centuries. Especially, the best part is how well he describes the characters. You learn and understand the main character as if he is your brother or son or any of your relative. I strongly recommend it for young reader who likes to read classics. "
"1607",1606,"Verity","We all make mistakes. Some people make big mistakes. And try to cover them up. Other people make it their business to bring hidden deeds to light. The interrogation scene in this book is extraordinary for its perspicacity, a clarity of vision that penetrates to the heart of the human psyche. Winner!"
"1608",1607,"Faith","Üçüncü kez okuduğum, insanın okuduğu her dönemde farklı tatlar aldığı başyapıt. İnsan psikolojisini anlatmakta zaten zirve bir yazar Dostoyevski; bu zirve yazarın zirve eseri de Suç ve Ceza olunca alınan zevk çifte katlanıyor."
"1609",1608,"Laura Leaney","This is a GREAT book of literature. It is a mesmerizing, hypnotizing, fascinating look at the human mind and its drives and motivations. The book's central concerns are so varied and so relevant as to take away one's breath. What is covered? Only the nature of man, the nature of evil, the conflict between fate and free will, the effects of poverty and environment on the psyche, the significance of dreams, the moral dilemmas inherent in utilitarianism, the significance of suffering, the effects of guilt, the nature of existential action, the difference between ordinary and extraordinary human beings, and perhaps most importantly, the possibility for redemption. ""Crime and Punishment"" takes us into the congested, stinking, summer streets of St. Petersburg in 1865 and forces us to contemplate the geography of our own mind by following the sick anxiety of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov as he contemplates murder (and does it) then suicide (and rejects it). The punishment that follows is gothic, thriller-like! We meet doppelgangers and doubles, and we watch as the detective Porfiry Petrovich hunts him down using psychoanalytical tools new to the time. Dostoyevsky is acutely aware of the troubles inherent in the modern mind: the conflict between spirituality/religion/God and the desire for free will/greatness/social progress. Some people find Raskolnikov ""whiny,"" and in a way he is, but what he is whining about concerns mankind's social ills, and they are not trivial. I first read this novel in high school. I did not find it an easy read then. But I could not get Raskolnikov out of my mind. His behavior fascinated me - and although my situation was nothing like Raskolnikov's, I couldn't help but understand his anger and his self-loathing. Alfred Kazin said that Raskolnikov is Dostoyevsky's Hamlet, his ""deranged prince - a prince passing through great turmoil, unkind to those who love him best, suspicious of everyone; a prince who has killed [. . .:] out of impatience at his own weakness - yet a prince nevertheless, one of the true souls among men."" To me, he is also a prince of suffering. He is one of the most tortured souls in literature, and although I was never a complete fan of the epilogue, I always loved him and wished and wished that he would find his peace in that pastoral Siberian prison Dostoyevsky puts him in. The writing is concentrated, purposeful. Every scene works to advance the possibility of Raskolnikov's confession and ""resurrection."" All of the primary symbols of the unconscious are here: blood, water, enclosed spaces (coffins, closets) are but to name a few. Characters pop up as if they arrive from ""underground"" as reminders of guilt. There are rumors of women raped, children who hang themselves in garrets, and beatings. There is nowhere that Raskolnikov can go to escape the violence, the depravity, and worse, the horror of his own crime. This is a marvelous book. Do not let the complexity and the length deter you from reading it."
"1610",1609,"رقية","هذا الكتاب من أكثر الكتبِ التي أثّرت عليّ في سنوات مراهقتي -12 سنة- لدرجة أنني لم أستطع النوم ثلاث ليال ممتابعة وتوقفت عن الأكل تمامًا حتى شكّت أمّي بأنني مريضة بمرض خطير، ثم حين عرفت أنّني فقط متعبة بسبب تأثير الكتاب أخبرت أخي الأكبر -ماجد الذي أحضر لي الكتاب- بأنّها ستغضب ولن تسامحه لو جاء لنا بكتب أخرى على هذه الشاكلة."
"1611",1610,"Tomás","A ver...que puedo decir de semejante clásico? Fue todo un desafío leerlo. Al principio asusta tanto por su longitud como por su dificultad. Mucho pensamiento metido en los diálogos (sería interesante leer trabajos críticos de la novela, sobre todo la teoría polifónica que hizo Bajtín sobre la obra). En fin, personajes inolvidables y una carga filosófica, ética y moral muy grande. Una obra sumamente compleja, repito. Probablemente vuelva a leerla otra vez por si se me perdieron detalles con la primera lectura. Me parece interesante destacar que, habiendo sido escrita a mitades del siglo XIX, sigue siendo actual, tocando temas que siguen estando en boca nuestra hoy en día. Un lujo haberlo leído. Pasó a formar parte de mis novelas favoritas instantáneamente."
"1612",1611,"Liner","I loved this book because it was challenging.... although it did get a little boring at first it did keep me interested....whoever is intrigued by the art of crime I highly recommend you to read this especially if you are into Law & Order."
"1613",1612,"Jaymason","This book was great!I think anyone who has ever read ""Beyond Good and Evil"" should definitely read this... I feel like they're very much related, due to Raskolnikov's thoughts on morality.As great as this book was, I am DEFINITELY not reading it again. Ever. It's a struggle to get through after 50%. If you're going to read this book, you had better be committed."
"1614",1613,"Nancy","Another of my favorites -- again because of the character exploration. It really gets into the psyche of a killer. Hits home for me because it ultimately denounces the death penalty and shows how a person can change for the better."

"1620",1619,"Jill Stark","One of my all-time favorite books! I am a Russophile when it comes to literature, as anyone who knows me fully understands (my diatribe is in a Chekhov review). This novel fully portrays the mind of a man in desperation- desperate for money, desperate for purpose, desperate for companionship, desperate to be with his own demons. At the end is it the hunger that drove him to murder or just to see what happens when you cross the line? I think it's more the latter. The human condition is so complex and the matrices that make up decisionmaking are so intricate. At any time we can make the wrong move and it can be life-changing. This book shows that we really are closer to Raskolnikov than we care to admit."
"1621",1620,"Janelle Debiase","Reading this book again. First read it in high school because it seemed to be a classic, and loved it. Remains one of my favorite tragedies: not the downfall of Raskolnikov, but arrogance--the downfall of man. I plan to read some of his other works soon but this was definitely a great novel, and I don't know if he could top it. Recommended if you like books that keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. "
"1622",1621,"Christine Morse","Very difficult book until I got into the flow. The story is so relatable and vulnerable. It does take effort to understand the Russian culture but mostly, he's writing about all of us who acknowledge our human weakness, covering and exposure, I'm not sure about the ""rendering"" from another 'author' as they suggest. I'm all about unabridged versions from the original author.... At least until I need help understanding, which does happen."
"1623",1622,"Readuh","Read this book for the first time this year in school as a junior. Although the over-analytic perception of my english teacher made me a bit apathetic, I loved the storyline. Raskolnikov is truly a character that surprises you, but has enough substance to his character that may or may not make you adore him. Honestly, (and I don't know if this is a spoiler or not...) I felt like the actually murdering was done really quickly, but then everything around it, the suspense, made me want to keep reading. Keep in mind that the murder happens fairly early in the book...its the ""punishment"" part that leads the story to it's inevitable (sorry?) ending."
"1624",1623,"Lisa","This is my favourite book! For a book to be a classic such as this it has stood the test of time, yet still I find some to be quite a hard read. But not Crime & Punishment, it feels in some ways like it could have been written today. Love the writing style, the way I connected and could visualise everything."
"1625",1624,"Marysol Losada","sooo goooooodddddddddd, sooo goooooooooodddd, I loveeeeeee thisssssss booookkkkk. love it. the writing the story, I bet its so much better in Russian, I dont know..its entertaining and I like it. "
"1626",1625,"Aleksandra","An amazing and frightening story. What is very interesting - the narration allowes you follow the main character's, Raskol'nokov's thoughts and the development of his consciousness. And it describes distinctly the everyday life and problems of poor Russian families, like Marmeladov's one. The book impressed me, though I didn't read it when I should have done it - in the 10th school grade, in fact I read it last summer, 4 years after graduating from school. I think, the book shows what the real clemency can be like. The clemency which is able to forgive, to understand, and that is narrowly connected to love.. Or maybe it's love the thing that contains clemency?Though I think I coulnd't act like Sonya Marmeladova, I understand her. Her thoughts and feelings, emotionals seem closer to mine. Anyway I understand WHY she followed and forgave Raskol'nikov. I think it's an example of goodness. And it's important to have goodness in your heart, we are human beings first of all. If you understand what I mean)"
"1627",1626,"Charlaralotte","I count myself quite lucky that I read this after visiting St. Petersburg last month. Found having been to the city lent much to my reading of the book.Also pleased that my general vibe of the city was repeated by Dost. to a T. Bleak, depressing, smelly, enormous divide between rich & poor, general feeling of hopelessness. Or maybe I just identified too much with our main character. So lovely to read great literature after that spate of 3 books from Walmart. Ahhh, the intricate examinations of minute-by-minute changes in humor over the course of conversation. Brilliant. Reminded me of Butler's ""The Way of All Flesh."" On the brink of stream-of-consciousness writing.Have to say the anti-Semitic character descriptions and phrases were a bit of a downer. Tend to get terribly depressed when read yet more evidence of what a ""bad rap"" Jews have gotten throughout the ages. And this was written right before another fierce spate of pogroms in Russia, though not as fierce as the ones in 1881 following the Tsar's assassination, when Jews were blamed. Of course Germans get a bad rap too. On the whole, an excellent example of how the ""new world"" really did promise a new beginning, an escape from brutally confining stereotypes. Yeah, it's great to be a Puritan nation...So lovely to read a book written before the coming of movies. Not plotted like books today that are written so as to be easily be turned into a screenplay. Ah, the longing for the great serial novels of the past. Come back, Dickens!"
"1628",1627,"Sujeetha","Oh Wow! I can't simply believe my stupidity in putting off reading this book for so long. It is a poignant masterpiece which sheds light on human emotions and general state of human-ness. From depravity to vanity and simple-minded devotion, it touches on everything. This is a magnificent book. Read it! "
"1629",1628,"Pamela","WOW...what a thriller. It is like ancient CSI and Criminal Minds. I can now understand why it is such a classic. VERY well written and paced, it is a nail-biter the whole way through. I found myself to be sympathetic and disgusted with Raskolnikov...and I was as equally perturbed as he was by his mother and sister...(rolling my eyes). I will definitely read more Dostoevsky. This was a GREAT read and well-deserved of the 5 stars... "
"1630",1629,"Patreck","Have you ever thought about the insane? Murder, death, or how about love? Ever give those strong words a thought? If you have, then I got a book for you. Crime and Punishment by the author of Fyodor Dostoyevsky is a thrilling novel that takes you through the mind of a corrupt man. Is there anything worse than murder? Raskolnikov commits a crime, but is never found guilty. He finds anger towards his mother and sister; for not telling him of his sister’s fiancé Porfiry Petrofich. Both end up battling each other to see who is more intelligent and who will win the heart of Raskolnikov’s sister. Detectives linger on trying to find the man who committed the crime. Clues are sought and the race against time is on, but what will happen? Will Raskolnikov get together with Sonia, the only girl who has attempted to comfort him, or will be caught, and die in prison? Why don’t you read and find out? If only questions were easier to answer. This book takes us through emotions and fate. Can one battle against his destiny; and what gives a man the “right” to kill? Crime and Punishment takes us through it all, but beware, it can bring emotional downfall. Are you brave enough to venture through the dark depths of the corrupt human mind?"
"1631",1630,"Seema","Simply Brilliant. I will have to say that there were pages upon pages that may seem dry and difficult to get through at times, but overall, I loved this book and it actually changed the way I saw the world (huge, for me at least.) Simply a great piece of literature and a stunning peak into the mind of someone so unlike myself. I actually started thinking like the character. Dostoyevsky manages to convey Russian sentiments like no other."

"1633",1632,"Brandi","This is one of those books that you're almost afraid to admit that you like. I love Russian lit because of its verbose nature (I discovered that writers got paid by the word so that's why Russian novels are seven day long). Raskolinov is one of those characters who is so caught up in his own grief and guilt that he creates his own world with its own moral code. Only problem is: he never bothered to let anyone else in on the rules. It's one of my favs but it always takes me several days to read and process the meaning."
"1634",1633,"Samantha","I actually really liked this book, despite the fact that half my class didn't. Though the writing style was a little dense at times, it was necessary to completely portray the protagonist's psyche and his warring mental states."
"1635",1634,"Dawn Hawkins","I have not been a great fan of all the classics. This is an exception. I felt every single pain Raskolnikov. This book describes a tortured soul that is feeling the guilt of committing a murder. The internalized torture of the protagonist is real and as accurately depicted as it could have been. The great thing about the book is that it offers a way out for the tortured soul, even if the result is not the most desirable. I would suggest this book for anyone who enjoys analyzing the human psyche."
"1636",1635,"Pamela Hazel","I first read this novel in high school, and found it so compelling that I carried it with me and read it during moments when I was supposed to be doing something else. ""Crime and Punishment"" is a must-read for all serious lovers of literary fiction. Readers interested in history, psychology, sociology and related topics should read it as well."

"1638",1637,"Cora Kipling","I read this before I went on holiday to Russia because I thought I would learn something about the country... It was harrowing... 'no food.. no shoes... no rubles etc'. Every time I went to read the book I felt similar to when I go for a run. IE, DREADING IT but glad afterwards. It was one of the best books I've read. I can't be bothered describing why it is so good, but it made me enjoy my time in Russia even more. "
"1639",1638,"Paul Trapani","This is one of the great books in literature. I found that this was a slow book for most of the story but what makes it great is that the author makes you think and often question yourself. In life today, many of us will always job to one side of a particular kind of problem but Dostoyevsky doesn't let that happen for too long in this book. The main character's actions throughout the book will make any reader rethink any assertions that had created while reading this book. The author does a great job of keeping the reader guessing, struggling to put the book down. He does this not with the action in the book but with many of the small decisions the main character has to make. The life that the character portrays can be related to many peoples' lives. The choices we make are sometimes very good and sometimes very bad; which makes the book and the main character so likeable and human. I found myself rooting for him throughout the story, regardless of his actions. Read the book if you want a suspenseful, crafting story of good and bad. Many people will be horrified with the actions displayed in the book but they simply don't realize how many things in common they have with the protagonist. "
"1640",1639,"Dave Hill","I would have been happy with just crime."
"1641",1640,"Steven Peterson","This is, of course, one of the great novels of all time. Fyodor Dostoyevsky created a number of truly wonderful works over time, such as ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" ""The Gambler,"" and ""The Devils"" (or ""The Possessed""). The ""Translator's Introduction"" to ""Crime and Punishment"" provides useful context. David Magarshack, the translator, observes that (page 11) "". . .the main theme. . .had occupied Dostoyevsky ever since he gave up his career in the army to devote himself to literature."" Shortly thereafter, Magarshack quotes Dostoyevsky himself from an earlier work, ""White Knights,"" with the author saying (page 11): ""'It is said that the proximity of punishment gives rise to real repentance in the criminal and sometimes arouses remorse in the most hardened heart; it is said to be chiefly due to fear."" Thus, there is a psychological element to this novel, whether is approximates reality or not (I have my doubts that a lot of criminals really repent and show remorse, but that is neither here nor there). The novel itself was important for Dostoyevsky since, as was not uncommon, he was in dire financial straits. He signed a contract to provide a serialization of the work to a literary publication. This is apparent at some points, when different parts of the novel may not fit together so well or when certain strands of discourse aren't fully developed. The protagonist, Raskolnikov, faces a series of problems. For one thing, he is a student who faces dire poverty and has a difficult time just making ends meet. At another level, he has a sense that special human beings can be above the law and so on to do great deeds. These two factors plus others are interlinked to lead him to murder a pawnbroker to help gain enough money to survive. On being ""superman,"" Raskolnikov says at one point (page 276): ""I simply hinted that the `extraordinary' man has a right--not an officially sanctioned right, of course--to permit his conscience to step over certain obstacles, but only if it is absolutely necessary for the fulfillment of his idea on which possibly the welfare of all mankind may depend."" And, in a following commentary (page 277): "". . .I maintain that all men who are not only great but a little out of the common. . .must by their very nature be criminals. . . ."" After committing the murder, he begins to come apart, as he suspects that people know of his deed. In another plot twist, after meeting a civil servant, Marmalodov, he comes to be attracted to his daughter, Sonya. He comes to confess to her of his deed. Later, he falls in love with her, but his imprisonment means that they would need to delay a life together. She follows him to Siberia, and the novel ends with hope for the future. This is one of the great novels, no doubt. There are problems, as noted above, with the development of the story and with its ending (almost deus ex machine). Nonetheless, an interesting psychological analysis of the human mind. Still worth reading long after he completed writing it in 1866. Raskolnikov remains one of the great characters in literature, and his slow unraveling after the murder creates gripping drama. "

"1644",1643,"Dominika","One of my three most favorite books of all time. (The other two being The Brothers Karamazov and David Copperfield)I was 13 or 14 when i first read it for school, it was the first grown-up book that i had read, and it ended up being the book that made me fall in love with the classics.I have re-read it since and I'm definitely planning to read it again.A must-read for every Dostoevsky fan.The book is thrilling and exciting from beginning to end. It sucks you into its world and there is no way out until you finish it."
"1645",1644,"Carrie","A long read that took me a long while... but worth it! Psychological, meticulous, a simple story told profoundly. "
"1646",1645,"Mallory","WOW this book was the biggest surprise EVER for me. After reading War and Peace earlier this year I decided I no longer needed to be intimidated by classic Russian lit, but I never expected to enjoy this book as much as I did. I DEVOURED this story. One of my top 5 favorites I've read all year!! "
"1647",1646,"Aliza","This simply blew my mind. Easily the best novel I've read till now. Brilliant characters that are as much flesh and blood as they are fantastical. Most of them are round characters whom we see transform throughout the course of the novel. Raskolnikov is the perfect antihero, Svidrigaylov, the incredible conundrum, Sonya, the solid rock, Razumikhin, the male maternal figure, Porfiry, the infuriating justice-seeker, and Dunya, the sacrificial figure. But what's awesome is the fact that none of these can be limited by these descriptions, and are far more.This novel changes the way we look at crime and absolution. The imagery is terrifying and yet beautiful. There are scenes that are disturbing and yet are bound to touch your heart. Surely, this must be what they call a masterpiece."
"1648",1647,"Josh Morgan","Read this way back in high school for my senior research paper. It's been quite a while since I've read it, but at the time I remember it being very long, very smart and VERY intense."
"1649",1648,"John Ching","Magnificent, I'm almost convinced Dostoevsky murdered someone for this book"
"1650",1649,"Travis Kirk","Ouch! This book opens with one of the most brutal looks at internal guilt. Picture a constant barage of inner demons driving someone to insanity. I read it during a season of my life when I was being attacked with guilt over a difficult decision. Fortunately, the book, and my life moved on from the punishment theme to other themes. The book is filled with hilarious characters. So is my life. "
"1651",1650,"Lee Krempel","I don't do long reviews. Maybe I'll go into more detail at a later date.As far as I am concerned, this novel is among, if not ""the"", greatest work of literature ever written. Realistic and beautiful. Despairing and in a way, hopeful. A novel that makes almost every other attempt at examining guilt and conscience look like ""Blues Clues."""
"1652",1651,"Darren Pryce","How do you think, does it worth reading? Definitely not, if you aren’t ready to continue living with a broken and sick mind. Although, they do feed us this book in schools, school is not a suitable place for it. Re-read it later, and you’ll change your mind again and again. That’s how it works with Dostoevsky - he is an every age writer. Dostoevsky was a brilliant psycho. A true damaged mind of his own time. If you are familiar with his own life story, you know what I mean. And his characters are never alright themselves. Like Rodion Raskolnikov, who is a promising character. He could make a great macho or an unforgettable rebel. But poverty draws him to committing a murder. And there it begins, a detective story where you are left on the wrong side of justice. Wondering what justice really is. Personally, I think I will never forget being physically sick along with Raskolnikov. But well, we have social topics, we have moral questions, and we combine them through philosophy. There it is - “Crime and Punishment” is a way to share a philosophy that Dostoevsky created, but wasn’t ready to support. So he used Rodion to do it for him."
"1653",1652,"Anetq","Mesterlig krimi! og er smukt eksempel på klassikere, der er blevet klassikere fordi de fortæller en god historie, der bliver ved med at være spændende og vedkommende (i modsætning til dem der blev kanoniseret og nu bør læses for deres historiske værdi, fordi de er klassikere...)Raskolnikov er Nietzsches overmenneske og undermenneske og Gud er (måske ikke) død. Men det er Nietzsche der har læst Dosto, ikke omvendt! Sonja Marmeladova er både luder og madonna, og sådan er der hele vejen store tematikker på spil. Romanens alder mærkes kun i beskrivelsen af fattigdom og usle kår (jeg ser meget arbejdermuseum for mig!) for hele persongalleriet er yderst levende og nutidigt beskrevet - det er en overraskende moderne roman - mon ikke det til dels skyldes Jan Hansens friske oversættelse? I hvert fald yderst læselig og uden brug for ""oversættelse"" pga. sproglig eller indholdsmæssig ælde. Og et værk fra 1866, der kan klare sig med 4 siders noter til at tage lidt russiske titler, sørgegrød og tiltaleskik er enten brandgodt oversat eller en eviggyldig klassiker - jeg mistænker at der her er tale om et både-og: Smuk oversættelse & fænomenalt værk!Jeg har ikke læst de russiske klassikere før, delvist fordi det lød så besværligt at holde styr på stor persongallerier af folk der hele tiden blev kaldt noget nyt - men det er egentlig ikke så besværligt at holde styr på: Raskolnikov (efternavn i omtale) Rodion Romanovitj (fornavn + paternym) i højlig tiltale - og så Rodja som kælenavn når mor og søster er på banen. Det går snildt. Så bare se at komme i gang: det er alle 678 sider værd, folk bliver frygteligt imponerede over det og du har den jo alligevel stående på reolen fra et optimistisk bogklubtilbud engang, ikke?"
"1654",1653,"Ian Zimmerman","This book contains the themes of guilt, redemption, forgiveness, and love amongst other things. A young but isolated intellectual murders a pawn broker to prove that he is an ""extraordinary man"". Supermen are not bound by the laws that lesser men have to follow. Supermen can judge inferior beings and murder for thier own personal gain without a shred of remorse. However, Raskolnikov does not achieve this goal because he still has humanity and a heart. He is soon torn apart by guilt and to make matters worse he finds out that one of his victims was the only friend of his love interest. He wishes to confess his crimes to Sonya, but is afraid that she will reject him when she finds out his horrible deed. Eventually he does confess and she amazingly forgives him. He then goes through a Christian rebirth and seeks out redemption. This book is amazing in its character psychology, storytelling, and philosophy. C&P boldly rejected the cutting edge theories of morality coming out of Western Europe(especially Germany) at the time. The ideology of the ""extraordinary man"" that Raskolnikov follows in the beginning of the novel is similar to Nietzsche's ubermensch, although Nietzsche didn't write Zarathustra until after C&P was written. It is interesting that Dostoevsky rejects the works of Nietzsche and others like him from the approach of an intellectual and not a close minded bible thumper like so many of Nietzsche's opponents. Dostoevsky was a socialist in his youth and member of a radical group that ended up causing him jail time in Siberia following a mock execution. Dostoevsky became disillusioned with the new Western ideology because he saw its infinite potential for exploitation by tyrants as outlined in The Demons. Dostoevsky converted to Christianity and believed that Christian morality and the Golden Rule were the best path for Russia to follow. Dostoevsky was indeed correct that when anti-Christian communism and post-moral philosophy came to Russia it wasn't long before Stalin came into power and killed millions to further his own power. The fact that Dostoevsky's rejection of post morality is well thought out and not simply a knee jerk reaction is one reason why Nietzsche had a profound respect for Dostoevsky despite thier differences of opinion. This book is very dark and fairly depressing, so it isn't for everyone. It is though one of my personal favorites."
"1655",1654,"Seth Kenlon","I have to admit, this might not actually be the translation I read; I can't remember the translator. But as for the book itself - well, it's just one of the best. A lot of people have said that, and I never really understood why they said it. But upon re-reading it, I realized that the reason it's so good is that it really makes you think. Raskolnikov's trials are not so unique to him in literature, but his reactions to them are, and the way his mind works really does start to affect you, and it makes you think about a lot of different social and personal topics. Cannot recommend enough."
"1656",1655,"Winter Sophia Rose","Crime, Punishment, Sin & Redemption! Brilliant Book!"
"1657",1656,"Scot","I meant to read this novel when I was in my 20s, but somehow never got around to it—in part, because an intellectual friend of mine, who was given to dark views of human nature, would sometimes (especially after a few stiff drinks) work dramatic references to Dostoevsky into his dour laments on the human condition. It sort of scared me off—why make the commitment to such a long book from another century and another continent, I reasoned at the time, only to be reminded that my life is dreary and struggle is futile?I’m glad I finally decided to read this masterpiece even if it is thirty years later, although choosing to read it during the week of final exams, when students and faculty alike are stressed out by deadlines and demands, and rationalizations and excuses for work left undone multiply around me, was probably not a wise timing. The novel did not tell me life was futile, though it did cast a remarkably astute look at the grim inequities of the social condition for so many, in a realistic way that kept making me stop and remind myself: Dostoevsky wrote this in 1866! What a literary groundbreaker he was!And his deep psychological insights, before modern psychology had developed, startled me. So much of modernism has ancestral roots here—I had never understood that before. He made me truly identify with and care about the perspectives of a cold blooded murderer, and was a demonstrated master at creating a sense of hopelessness in the throes of bureaucracy (or one's conscience, for that matter) well before Kafka. Of course I would never support anyone actually doing what Raskolnikov did to that greedy old pawnbroker, but, both philosophically and spiritually, I think I am actually a better, more reflective person for having vicariously gone through that exercise and its subsequent aftermath with him. Thank you, Fyodor. "

"1659",1658,"Samantha Flaum","This is my new favorite book. It beat out Wuthering Heights. Once again Russian authors trump all the rest. Dostoyevsky has a magical talent that makes you fall in love with Raskolnikov and hope he ends in good spirits, despite his actions. I just finished it a month ago and already want to reread it. During, I couldn't wait to find out what happened, but also never wanted it to end."
"1660",1659,"Carole","Make sure that you are mature when you read it. Just like an adolescent might think Romeo and Juliet is a love story instead of an infatuation, there are some things I don't think are well understood unless you're older.I have to laugh at one point...a pattern I've noticed in Russians. They laugh harder, stay angrier longer, get into a deeper depression compare to any other, and argue intellectually more abstractly than any other group I can tell. "
"1661",1660,"Lynnette Dow","Most definitely one of the best books I've ever read. In my opinion Dostoyevsky's masterpiece."
"1662",1661,"Tnahsin Garg","“Taking a new step, uttering a new word, is what people fear most.” I've had a bit of an affair with Russian authors before chancing upon Dostoyevsky. From Nabokov's Lolita to a few short stories of Tolstoy and Gogol, Russian works had a special corner of admiration in my heart. After finishing Crime and Punishment, I can very well say that this corner has grown into a large, spacious room, a room full of reverence. Such is the effect that every eccentric character of this genius work left upon me. Rodion, the central character of great intellect, undergoing through great misery and circumstantial pressure (part of which is a false construction from his excessively paranoid brain), finds himself plummeting towards a hideous murder and the guilt that follows soon after. Rodion has all qualities that one may ascribe to a hero or an anti-hero, he may even be loathsome to several readers. His monomania, self-obsessed behavior and ruthless, flawless intellect renders him as a charming personality. What is crime? What, in essence, it really is? Who defines it? And why? And how? Isn't morality only a matter of perspective? Dostoyevsky points plethora of such poignant questions, on a backdrop of the evils of then Russian society (which is very relatable to that of urban India) through his formidable array of characters, and leaves the reader biting his nails in what is also a 'what-will-happen-next' kind of thriller. While the prose is mainly governed by dialogue and little authorial observation, it's the characters' introspection and psychological analysis of each other that bowled me off my feet. This is one of those novels in which you, only few pages in, become aware of the potential of literary treasure that you hold in your hands. Final Verdict: If you're slightly eccentric, have occasionally looked down upon your fellow human beings, and live in a self-constructed invisible bubble foaming with delusions of grandeur, you'll love this book. And of course, go for it, if you're otherwise sane and have a great interest in human psychology & classic literature. Overall, it can be a highly disturbing book for the common reader, and hence recommended with caution. "
"1663",1662,"Maren","This is a fantastic book, one I would suggest to any brave and dedicated reader. I thoroughly enjoyed it, although I would not suggest it to those people who need lots of action. This is a thinking book. :) The philosophies set forth are entirely interesting. "
"1664",1663,"Kirk Morrison","This book is a classic for a reason and I highly recommend it. The sweeps of emotion from base desires Roskolnikov lets loose, to his guilt, to his redemption are powerful. The people who care for him are well-drawn (i.e Sonia, Razumikhin). I've always particularly enjoyed the cat and mouse game the unstable Roskolnikov plays with Porfiry Petrovich."
"1665",1664,"Ken Gibson","Crime and Punishment first came to me in college, almost 50 years ago. I'm sure I read the Constance Garnett translation then. A couple of years ago I read the McDuff translation and sent a copy to a friend in prison. I wanted him to read something that impressed me when I was his age. And I wanted to be able to dscuss it with him. I looked at bits of several translations, both online and in bookshops. It is astonishing how different the translations are. Do you want to read it in the English of the 19th century or in the American of the 20th or 21st centuries? Well now I want to read it again in Russian.The book is about guilt and atonement, fear and a sort of absolution. If that comes through, the translation is okay."
"1666",1665,"Cerys","The most in-depth and gripping look into the psyche of a broken yet plausible man, who's sense of morals and justice twist along with the plot. What is crime, who is a criminal, and do we have any right to judge these people? Crime and Punishment presents questions that we don't think of on our own, and makes us question a concept which has existed within humanity for hundreds of years."
"1667",1666,"Neha","I see Crime and Punishment in Everything now. From Nouvelle Vague (please try and tell me A Bout de Souffle isn't so C&P-y.) to The Mountain Goats songs. Love its permeability and applicability. Love it. "
"1668",1667,"Brett","This book was really hard to read for me. It was pretty slow, all the Russian names were confusing, and it was morose. I really was on the fence about it going into the last twenty pages, but it concluded so well that I loved it. I can't exactly explain why the events were as redemptive as they were, I just know that the smallest bit of grace in a sea of morbidness was nearly euphoric. Brilliant."
"1669",1668,"Chloe Nobuhara","Assume mankind is divided into two classes: ordinary and extraordinary. Do extraordinary men have an obligation to abide by their own moral code and transcend societal law? If no, then governing principles may remain forever stagnant...divorcees would still be stoned and atheists executed for their speech. But if yes, are men not self-centered egoists that would each wrongly consider himself extraordinary? If all men followed their individual moral codes, we'd follow mankind straight into anarchy!This vital argument that threads itself throughout the novel is framed by a broader, older philosophical question: Is despotism preferable to anarchy? I'm convinced that this is true, and thus the epilogue left me wondering if God is truly a despot...But a million different readings of Crime & Punishment could produce a million different answers to this essential question. It's up to the reader to pick up on cues in the raw, realist and still currently relevant dialogue and to see into the brilliantly, imperfectly crafted minds of each character. Whatever your answer, Dostoevsky's classic is an absolutely quintessential read for philosophical / psychological / Russian / 19th century literature. N.B. Referring to man and mankind and using male pronouns was done out of convenience, not in any way a stylistic choice. Obviously, moral conundrums apply to women, too."

But gradually it all came back to me.I was only glad that I didn't have to read about Raskolnikoff's (Did I get his name right?) delirious state again. One of the most boring experiences of my life!I was satisfied with the ending. Old Rasko got what he deserved. Yes I say so even when I like him.

"1675",1674,"carolyn.reads","It is an understatement to say that this is my favorite Dostoyevsky novel, or that it is my favorite novel EVER. It's funny to think that this novel was forced on me in AP English Lit in high school, especially since it is my all time favorite novel. As an English and Psychology major, i love that i can analyze this novel from two different perspectives, but i tend to learn towards a psychological analysis more. The psychological aspect of the novel is so beyond amazing that sometimes i wish Dostoyevsky was alive so that i can have a conversation with him, to find out why he went about creating Raskolnikov’s diliriums, and hallucinations the way he did. I wonder what Dr. Freud would have said about his state of consciousness, and the human psyche; probably that it is a matter of principle, as in how his psyche conditions, his impulses, and his actions relate to his principles. To summarize this novel in one sentence is as follow: the novel is about the fluctuating mental state of 23 year young Raskolnikov as he commits a hedious crime, becomes tormented about being caught, and finally turns himself in. A lot of readers will say that he was tormented by guilt, but i am not most readers and i immensely disagree. I believe that he never felt guilt or remorse for what he did to the pawnbroker, in fact i think he was tormented because he didn't commit the prefect crime. The novel starts with Raskolnikov planning the perfect crime, he wants to murder Alyona because he considers her a ""louse,"" hates her for cheating people, and inslaving her younger sister. He feels that he is doing a good deed for society by punishing (killing) Alyona, in a way it seems that he has label himself a ""judge,"" or perhaps a ""God"" ala Light Yagami/Kira from ""Death Note."" It's easy to see why, especially since he considers himself a part of the extraordinary people. I bet he thought it was his ""duty"" to kill her, this beings me back to the viewpoint that he did not feel guilty about killing her, he felt anxious that one of the construction workers saw him leave the pawnbroker's place, and thus the police would find him. Dostoyevsky's explicit discriptions of Rodka's pysche, nuerotic tendencies, diliriums, hallucinations, and cosciousness make for a great case study/read of a literary character. "
"1676",1675,"Bill","I bought this edition (the Constance Garnett translation) for a dollar at my ""friends of the library"" bookstore. That was the best dollar I ever spent. For a book written in the middle of the last century, it seems surprisingly modern. Dostoyevsky had a good handle on psychology. The characters are believable down to their inner lives. The author also has a Dickensian gift for capturing the essence of people in different strata of society.I liked this novel far better than The Brothers Karamazov, which came later. In fact, it's in my top five favorite novels (maybe number one). Since I don't speak Russian, I have no beef with Garnett's translation; Dostoyevsky scholars seem to think that she murders the text but, as the Italians say, ""traduttore, traditore."" It would be interesting to read the Pevear / Volokhonsky translation someday but I'm fine with the one I read for now."

"1680",1679,"Milica Radić","Just fenomenal. Dostoyevsky is a pure psychological genius."
"1681",1680,"T K","Please, in a long review like this, it is bound to have some spoilers. I have tried to limit it, and tried not to make this into a summary for students.This is one book I cannot help but rant like a fangirl. To me, this is the “ultimate book”. In a light perspective, it is an awesome thriller.The grotesque but fascinating description of the murder, accompanied by the “delirious” thoughts of Raskilnikov… Later on with all this internal torment, and Porfiry’s creepy way (which I just loved, with all those “hee-hees”!) of pressuring Raskolnikov to confession. In a more serious perspective… it is awesome nevertheless.But hark! There is more!There is angelic Sonya and hedonistic Svidrigailov.If I should throw few more in, we have demoralized Mermaldov and depraved Luzhin. With those characters, Crime and Punishment is a book that questions morality. Whether it is about life, fidelity and responsibility… it just somehow incorporates them all. Some are quite subtle, some are not.Lizaveta's death (kind, devout sister of Alyona Ivanovna, who just had to step in when Raskolnikov just murdered Alyona) was what broke Raskolnikov the most. (As in, oh the guilt! It’s unbearable!)It does make sense, because we are talking about the blood of an ""innocent"". When one works for the ""greater good"" or a ""higher purpose"", not only is there the extermination of ""evil"" (though different from point of view and with a possible replacement word), there is always the sacrifice of the ""innocent"" (similar to evil in this case). In war, we have death of the (""evil"") enemies, along with countless numbers of (""innocent"") civilians. During hard times, a company may fire people so that they don't go bankrupt (extermination of potential bankruptcy). However, aren't those people just as desperate to sustain their life and family? I could even talk about, heaven forbid, Dumbledore's antics with this one. Nevertheless, there is the moment when we trouble our ethics, for the “greater good”.If I could add a bit more with this rant, which must bore you people all, I will say that this thinking also comes out in The Karamazov Brothers (or The Brothers of Karamazov, depends on what publisher.) In Book 5 Chapter 4 Rebellion, Ivan (an intellectual & atheist) asks Alyosha (little brother, character which I see as Dostoyevsky’s version of the Little Prince. Then again, I am not finished with this book). He asks “Imagine that you are charged with building the edifice of human destiny, whose ultimate aim is to bring people happiness, to give them peace and contentment at least, but that in order to achieve this it is essential and unavoidable to torture just one little speck of creation, that same little child beating her breast with her little fists, and imagine that this edifice has to be erected on her unexpiated tears. Would you agree to be the architect under those conditions?” When Alyosha replies no, he goes on with “And could you accept the idea that the people for whom you are building the edifice have agreed to buy their own happiness with the price of the unexpiated blood of a tortured child, and that, having accepted this, they could remain happy forever?” There is redemption, absolutely (at least for Raskolnikov). Probably the reason why I do not see Dostoyevsky based on his rather dark reputation for depressing stories. (If we see authors in that perspective, Sir William Golding was a villain.) When Raskilnikov, for inner peace confesses and finds love with Sonya… “Both of them looked pale and thin; but in these ill, pale faces there now gleamed the dawn of a renewed future, a complete recovery to a new life. What had revived them was love, the heart of the one containing an infinite source of life for the heart of the other.” (Epilogue, Chapter 2), we see a happy ending. We have to understand Sonya being just too kind and angelic in this book. I am not a fan of such characters, and sometimes dislike/hate them. I find them unattractive, for the lack of better words. However, I made Sonya an exception, even when she moved so that she can visit Raskolnikov in jail. The action is unrealistic and foolhardy, but it is nice, not irritating.One word (ahem… few sentences) about “redemption” before I go on. Redemption in this book does not merely mean getting rid of guilt. It also means finding life. There is Svidrigailov, who is considered Raskolnikov’s darker counterpart in some way. He ends with committing suicide (failed to find ""life""). I remember that it was strangely… sad. Not in the usual detached way when reading books. I felt that weird feeling crawling (more like “smarming”) over me. At least that was my initial impression of his ending. It happened at the end of Part 6 Chapter 6. After going forward few pages, I came back and reread his nightmares (which he dreams just before his demise) and his death. I will just say I was not trying to be sentimental. I was in a beach, reading while other people were playing, splashing water against each other, and having fun. After rereading, I closed my book, looked at the horizon, and began to cry. Someone save me!Oh, and concerning the drama of Russian novels in general… well, just get used to it. I once thought, “…I don’t think anybody would actually act like that in real life.” Hey, it takes time. Especially with this one filled with anxiety and delirium. At the end, it is one book I desperately wish to read again. I actually do, going through it time to time. I could say this book has changed my life. Perhaps it is because I am young, and I have yet to read hundreds of great book. Nevertheless, the moment I read this, I declared myself an avid fan of his. (While I have authors I like, I was never a fan.) It is powerful. It is more than a mere didactic novel. It is something I would recommend with fanatic craziness to anybody."
"1682",1681,"Taylor","One of my favorite books I've ever read. An interesting mixture of the macro and the micro and how shifting societal platforms influence the ragged veins of a murderer that is somehow sympathetic in his clumsiness and self-validation. The turmoil is absolutely wrenching, while the horror of the crime drifts throughout the ambiguity of the city. Disappointed in myself that it took me so long to finally begin it. "
"1683",1682,"Gustman17","Un viaje dentro de la psicología de un joven atormentado por sus conflictivas ideas. Dostoyevsky es un maestro a la hora de describir el mundo interno de sus personajes, como si cada percepción y reacción fuese un hecho positivo y observable, y por lo demás esencial dentro de la trama. Esta atención al detalle da lugar a que los cientos de páginas de esta novela describan solo un par de días, y a cada evento se le importante se le dediquen decenas de páginas. A mi me atemorizaba este aspecto de la novela, pensando que su lentitud podría hacerla aburrida, pero en cambio dota a cada acción de gran peso e importancia. Desde el primer día que lo leí no quería despegar los ojos para saber cómo resolvería Raskolnikof las consecuencias internas y externas de su crimen, o en qué acabarías la historia de su hermana y otros personajes relevantes para la trama. A final de cuentas la conclusión ha sido suficientemente satisfactoria, con algunos episodios bastante intensos y memorables más algunos temas dignos de análisis (como aquella que pudiéramos considerar un antecedente a la teoría nietzscheana del superhombre, el problema de la culpa, la responsabilidad, la moral, la fe religiosa, etc.), pero lo mejor ha sido la capacidad de Dostoyevsky para pintar cuadros en la cabeza del lector para una grata inmersión dentro de su turbada Petersburgo. Mención para la traducción de José Fernández en la editorial Juventud, muy grata y fluida, con un más que adecuado vocabulario."

"1689",1688,"Dana Ilie","Este cartea care mi-a marcat adolescenta , si prima la care ma gandesc atunci cand ma intreaba cineva de ce sa citesc cartea cand pot sa vad filmul…. Nu am intentia sa tin prelegeri legate de avantajul si farmecul cartilor, si nici nu vreau sa ponegresc lumea filmului. Sunt ecranizari foarte bine facute, ( succesul unei ecranizari sta in ochii privitorului , cum si-a imaginat lumea descrisa in carte, cum vede cu ochii mintii personajele etc.) dar nu am intalnit una sa fie mai buna decat cartea… Poate nu am citit eu suficiente carti, sau poate nu am vazut filmele care sa imi schimbe parerea.Dostoievski este considerat un autor greu de citit, mie nu mi s-a parut greu, ci profund. Personajele lui chiar daca nu sunt ancorate in realitate sunt asa de real descrise si creionate incat este imposibil sa nu empatizezi cu trairile lor. Lupta interioara a lui Rodin , revolta pe care am simtit-o vis-a-vis de situatia nefericita in care se afla ca si tanar ce vrea sa faca ceva in viata si nu este sprijinit material, dezamagirea pe care am simtit-o atunci cand a savarsit crima, m-au fermecat si nu am putut sa las cartea din mana. Trebuie sa recunosc, apasarea pe care o simti dupa ce inchizi cartea trece greu, imi aduc aminte ca timp de o saptamana nu am inceput alta carte, simteam nevoia sa las timpul sa treaca , sa “rumeg” tot ce am simtit, sa filtrez informatiile.Recomand cartea celor ce vor povesti reale, fara happy end, trairi profunde, personaje schitate fin si clar. Numai citind cartea poti sa iti faci o parere , iar cuvintele mele sunt mult prea sarace."
"1690",1689,"Katie","I loved this book. It is a beautiful descent into the human mind as it's being destroyed by the guilt of murder. On top of that, the investigator is trying to find who the murderer is.

Everyone should read this book. Only Dostoevsky could successfully portray a murderer with whom I could so closely identify. He gives us a window directly into the workings of the human mind; I often found myself reading a line of Raskolnikov’s inner monologue and thinking “I think I’ve done the exact same thing before!”Also, Raskolnikov is not the only likable character. Everyone is flawed, but most of the characters have at least some admirable qualities (except for maybe a couple who are mostly just disgusting). And Rodya’s school friend Razumikhin is downright charming. In short, this book is amazing and will make you feel a lot of things. After I finished it earlier today, all I could do was sit dumbly and bask in the warmth of a perfect story completed so effortlessly before my eyes. "
"1693",1692,"Simon","When Raskolnikov embedded his axe in the pawnbroker´s head, he forfeited his humanity and embraced godhood. He abandoned his sanity and soul in the name of justice and extirpated a dangerous parasite from society. The idea of a man who breaks society´s morals in the name of justice and becomes able to build a new ethic code haunted Western Literature for decades, which culminated with the idea of the übermensch as stated by Nietzsche. However Raskolnikov himself became a monster when he killed an innocent woman in an attempt to save his own skin. He could become a victim of a justice seeker himself. However he found redemption in the hands of an ordinary woman, Sonia. The pawnbroker found justice in the form of punishment, Raskolnikov found it in the form of guilt and redemption. Pain cleansed him and led him to find illumination. As Baudelaire wrote “Praise be to You, O God, who send us suffering As a divine remedy for our impurities”"

For me, their monologue is 'The Chatarsis'.. Really, you can just feel the pain, and in the and of the novel, the relief, the shelter..I didn't want to explain, or interpret this great work. I wanted to write down my feelings.. This book gives protection to me. It shows me, that there is light in the shadow.

"1701",1700,"Shane Avery","Where does one begin...?I've been trying to think of something meaningful to say. One thing is for certain, as Jonathan has pointed out: Dostoevsky doesn't like it when people think too much. But beyond this, what conclusions can be drawn? Any conclusions one might draw also have an antithetical negation. Is it possible that Roskolnikov is a philanthropic misanthrope? Although reducing human relations to a cold calculus, does legal positivism safeguard us from an otherwise terrifying & arbitrary sociology? Is religion necessary even if it's not true, in the ultimate sense?The psychological depth of the characters, particularly the main character, is breathtaking, chilling, and disturbing. Dostoevsky's ending, is, well, surprising. The moral of the story, it appears, is that intellection can only take us so far: we cannot dispense with affection, and that we are never beyond hope, even the most wretched among us. How lovely -- Dostoevsky's a sentimental fool ..."

"1703",1702,"Chauncey Bird","This book is absolutely deserving of its status as one of the greatest literary works ever created. The philosophy and layers of this book could be endlessly explored and discussed. Dostoyevsky is now one of my favorite authors. "
"1704",1703,"Marc","One of the most memorable books I have read. You can feel the guilt in the story."
"1705",1704,"Jaehee"," ""Crime and Punishment"" was my first taste of the writing style of the renowned author, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and I was thoroughly impressed by the depth and insight it contained. The book tells the story of the introverted Raskolnikov, a man living in a pre-Communist Russia that is filled with poverty and injustice. There, he meets a man named Marmeladov, a pathetic drunkard who buys alcohol from the money that his daughter Sonya makes from prostitution. Marmeladov's wife, Katarina, is a woman still wishing that she lived in her past, before her former husband had died. Raskolnikov's core belief in the story is that he can become an upper being - a man who is better than the society that he lives in and commit crimes without remorse. He wants to become a man like Napoleon. In his dream of becoming so, he is driven to kill a corrupt Landlady and her sister. After the crime, Raskolnikov realizes that his intellect was not enough to stifle his emotions, as he finds his mental state deteriorating.  The book's incredible length was a minor discomfort, but I was left turning the pages to observe the developing characters and story. Each character in the story is very symbolic, expressing the themes of the book. Raskolnikov sees the world around him and thinks of himself as a man who is better than it, so he decides to try to change it. Rasumikhin, Raskolnikov's brother, is the complete opposite of him. He sees the world as a dark place, but prefers to look at it in rose-tinted glasses. Marmeladov represents giving up while his wife represents a fall from grace. His poor daughter, Sonya represents a small kindness in a dark world.  The book starts off with themes of poverty and crime, but later moves on to the themes of guilt and redemption. Raskolnikov is tortured by the memory of the crimes, and he tries everything to redeem himself.  ""What do you think, would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds?""  I strongly recommend this book to those who like to think deep, and not to those who have been forced to read it in high school. "
"1706",1705,"Megan","In this work, Dostoyevsky presents a dark and twisted murder followed by the torturous progression of guilt like a terminal disease on the human spirit. But the heart of the question he presents is not about the double murder, but alludes to a larger concept encompassing the abilities of all men. Very engaging, troubling, and transforming. "
"1707",1706,"Anthony","While Notes From Underground suffers immensely from her rendering, even through the imperfect lens of a Garnett translation Dostoevsky's intensely metaphysical statement in Crime and Punishment on the dual natures of transgression and restraint, of suffering and rebirth, comes through astoundingly clear. If Gilead is a novel about the challenge to forgive, this is a novel about the challenge to repent. A book that every man should read once."
"1708",1707,"Nicklas Gunnarsson","Förordet till upplagan sa det mesta man behöver veta. Leta inte efter budskap eller dolda avsikter. Allt kommer till dig ändå. Det här är ingen bok som försöker säga en specifik sak. Den försöker beskriva människan. Och vem har kommit närmare än Dostojevskij? Han stiger ständigt i min lista på författare. Psykologin är fruktansvärt verklig. Den griper tag om en och får fem sidor långa brev utan styckeindelning att bli spännande. Tur att han skrev så mycket..."
"1709",1708,"Faye Williams","This book was hard to read... But it was also very good. Very bleak and morbid but quite scary when you're inside his head. I imagine it might be what it's like inside a psychopaths mind. Very intelligent man but using his brain to go against morals and society, then using his imprisonment to repent, grieve even. Also this book really makes you feel the hopelessness of the prison camp. Hard read but I'd still recommend it."

"1715",1714,"Flo","Read this book in a week; just couldn't put it down. The synopsis does little justice to the enormously complex themes and characters. Dostoevsky deserves every bit of credit that he gets as a literary god. He offers a complex and believable look into the mind of a murderer who considers himself part of the intellectual elite, and who killed in the name of a higher moral order. The story is told in third person omniscient mainly from the main character, Raskolnikov's, point of view, and it unfolds with suspense and various subplots. Really, it's like reading an episode of ""Law and Order: Criminal Intent,"" but better. Much better.Only Part I really addresses the murder, and the incident itself is described in merely 2-3 pages. The rest of the novel deals with Raskolnikov's psychological and moral ""punishment,"" which is far more tormenting than the legal punishment itself. Was he justified in killing a ""worthless"" pawnbroker because he was doing mankind a favor? Or was his guilty conscience eating him from the inside out and isolating him from the world he knew? Yes, no, yes, no. Those are the questions that Raskolnikov struggles with after the murder as he becomes increasingly delirious and paranoid. Dostoevsky explores the human condition, not only from the perspective of a criminal, but also from those around him -- the shrewd police detective, the unconditionally loving sister, the loyal friend, the emotionally wounded older man, and finally, the misunderstood but kind-hearted woman of ill repute. He also explores various questions of morality and existence-- When is it okay to kill? And who has the right to kill? Crime and Punishment is a psychological thriller that makes you stop and think about the nature of crime and criminals. *Spoiler Alert*For me, the most interesting aspect of this novel was that it explores the psyche of a middle class murderer, someone who considers himself learned and is well-respected by the community. Though he thinks of himself as better than everyone else and cleverer than most petty criminals, he eventually succumbs to the gravity of his crime and realizes that he is no better than anyone else. The story rests on the premise that even the most self-centered individual who commits a crime will eventually succumb to his conscience and realize that he did commit a sin. However, what about sociopaths, or those incapable of feeling guilt? Do they ever go through the same kind of ""punishment"" as Raskolnikov? And if not, does that confirm Raskolnikov's ""extraordinary man"" theory?"
"1716",1715,"Adrian","The original page turner? Quite a thing, a study really of what's inside a criminal's head. Or a mean's head; is he a criminal? Think of this book as solving the mystery backwards from how Agatha (or Mrs. Marple, if you prefer) does it."
"1717",1716,"Ashton","Honestly, I don't know what it was about this book that I liked so much. The translation I read was the most recent - Volokhonsky/Pevear - so perhaps the more modern language factored in. I really enjoyed the footnotes and the Russian naming system and I don't think I would have understood the book half as much without them.Inexplicably, against my own expectations, I found myself sucked into the book, and I'm almost afraid to reread it in case it is not as good the second time around. Literally, I went from: ""well, I suppose I'll have to read it on a 9-hour drive to Disney World"" to ""I wish I had it with me so I could read it in this godawful long line"", though throughout the 600-odd pages, I continually thanked God I never had to annotate it.And, weirdly enough, themes from this book have been popping up ever since. Raskolnikov is the perfect foil to Meursault in 'the Stranger', which was frustrating beyond belief come IB exam time, and Woody Allen's 'Match Point' is a flawed/skewed foil to the book as well (Cliff's Notes?), which was just a weird coincidence that I watched it mere weeks after finishing the book.No idea why, but 'Crime and Punishment' is one of my favorite books, and I'm half proud and half embarrassed of that fact (I mean really, who reads 'Crime and Punishment'?)"
"1718",1717,"erock","I believe Cypress Hill said it best when they said ""Here is one thing you can't understand...how I could just kill a man.""So true, so true. That is, until reading this book. I'm not a communist, nor do I think very highly of Russia, what with their tundras, meltdowns, and backwards R's. Not to mention their furry hats. I get it, it's cold, but really, you just look goofy in that hat. Did you ever see that episode of Cops-In Moscow? Exactly. I also think people who think that Dostoevsky is the greatest ever are boorish snobs. Ha. Boorish.Anyway, this book can be described with the following word: Incredible. I can't say that this book changed my life or anything, I mean if it did, then I may have murdered someone. But an incredible look into someone, seemingly stable and normal, who for a moment in time, loses focus, kills, and then is left to deal with their new reality.Insane in the membrane. "
"1719",1718,"AdultFiction Teton County Library","Teton County Library Call #: F DostoyevskyAdam's rating: 5 starsThere's a reason this is a classic. Devastatingly dark, but too compelling to put down. I found myself thinking about Dostoyevsky's characters even while I wasn't reading the book, and they've provided a platform by which to judge other characters in other books. I've caught myself thinking, is this character as depraved as Raskolnikov? If you want to be impacted by a story and left with your head spinning, than pick this one up. "
"1720",1719,"Sydne","If you ever have to explain the feeling of guilt and coming to terms with major wrong-doings to anyone, this book is the best to show a perfect depiction: from committing an almost ""justified"" and understandable murder (in the terms of fiction, of course, therefore allowing more leeway for unlawful behaviour for storytelling effects) to being a man completely crippled by guilt and remorse, the main character depicts all the tragedy and pain of taking someone's life.

"1723",1722,"Alexander Mackinnon","Dostoyevsky is always able to capture your mind and submerge you into the story to the point that you will feel the shame of poverty, the compelling need to justify the shameful plans, the fear of being discovered and the reality of the shame being the most powerful punishment that anyone could ever have. His masterful pen will make your heart pound with fear, you will smell the rubbish rotting in the heat of St Petersburg summer and the despair of human weakness."
"1724",1723,"Babydoll","I have been finished with this novel for about two days now, and could not bring myself to write a review of right away. I needed some time to ponder what to possibly say about this novel. I wanted to write a long, intelligent review of this great novel, but that would have been impossible to do without placing spoilers throughout my review, which not what I intended. My passion for literature began with my love for classic African American literature. One of my favorite authors in that genre of literature is Richard Wright. His novel, 'Native Son', told the story of Bigger Thomas who lived in a poverty stricken racist community, struggling to obtain an identity of integrity and respect during a time when African Americans were degraded, disrespected, and treated unequally. Bigger Thomas becomes a product of his negative environment, which created an insatiable rage within him. He responds to the social injustices and racial inequality by committing two horrendous crimes, and is put to trial for them. Wright is unapologetic to the systematic inequality and the inevitable reaction within the main character. Like Wright, Fyodor Dostoevsky created a character, Rodion Romanovitch Roskolnikov, who similarly became a product of his environment as a poverty stricken, failed student, and degraded by his community. Feeling hopeless, Raskolnikov decides to commit a crime to whom he felt was a devious and hated person, for the pursuit of a higher purpose. He then has to deal with the destructive moral and psychological consequences as a result of the crime. Dostoevsky does an amazing job depicting the inner battles and demons of a troubled man within the main character. Like Wright, Dostoevsky creates a literary genius that is sure to remain in the mind of readers."

"1727",1726,"Rawan Al Fadil","Dostoyevsky's master pieceThe character of Rodion is so intriguing, he is so intelligent yet so disoriented.I loved how Dostoyevsky portrayed his physiological and mental struggles, and how he described the Russian society with the utmost accuracy through his lamenting and destitute characters. This is a book that every avid literature lover needs to read,upon my word.I was furious with the ending though; just because Rodion mentally suffered and because he had a history of good conduct and goodwill doesn't exempt him from punishmenthe was punished alright,but why was it a light sentence ? Are you saying that regret and dejection is enough redemption for any crime ?If one is torn by remorse over his crime to the point that they almost lose their sanity,does that mean they are cleansed from sin ?All would've been fine if that was true, but the character of Rodion was not feeling guilty all along. He was so resolute and determined that his crime was fully justified and that he had the right to get away with it.He only gave up himself because he was tired of running away and because he needed peace of mind after all his mental torment and bullying by the detective...and only towards the end of the book,when he realized that he actually was capable of feeling love,that he thought of redemption as means of purifying his soul, to deserve the pure feelings of his loved one.See,this is why this book is genius,it raised a question with a ready answer,and then provided the opposing argument.I hope you like this book,because it is very,very,very dear to me."

Achilles heel; what was Svid's one downfall, rejected love of Dounia was not 100% contributive; socio-economic contrast - sanity is regained in the clean Siberian winter-side, as opposed to the closed and dirty St. Petersberg - before the murder; barbaric beating of the mare; compassionate reaction of the young Rask serves as a foreshadowing to Rask's ultimate repentance of the crime - Furthermore, he keeps searching to procrastinate and justify himself to avoid being accused; avoiding trying to take responsibility for the crime ; since fate is conspiring to allow him to commit the crime, he was chosen; but unplanned murder of Lizaveta destroys all of his justifications ; selfish act to avoid detection- burying under heavy stone symbolises smoldering of conscience; not benefiting from the act, neither materially nor in principle "

"1734",1733,"Haktan","Kitabı ilk kez elime alıp şöyle bir göz attığımda çevirmenin ""insan dehasının en yüce ürünlerinden biri"" ifadesi beni oldukça heyecanlandırmış ve meraklandırmıştı. Kitabı bu heyecan ve büyük beklentiyle uzun sürede okumama rağmen hiç hayal kırıklığına uğramadım.Kitap ve film karakterlerine hayranlık besleyenlerin Raskolnikovdan etkilenmemesi söz konusu değil. Dostoyevski öyle gerçekçi bir biçimde karakteri ortaya koymuş ki insana en ağır gelecek fikirlerinde dahi Raskolnikov'a kızamıyoruz. İnsan kendisini karanlıkta kalmış yanlarıyla bulabiliyor Raskolnikov'da ve daha bir anlayışla bakabiliyor kulağa pek de normal gelmeyen fikirlerine.İsminden de anlaşılacağı üzere, kitap insana suç ve ceza kavramlarını yeniden düşündürtüyor. Hatta yeniden inşa etmesini sağlıyor dersek de belki yanılmış olmayız. Gündelik hayatımızdan oldukça aşina olduğumuz bu iki kelimenin aslında ne kadar derin ve karmaşık olduğunu anlamamızı sağlıyor.Hani kimi kitaplardan sonra daha farklı hissettiğinizi düşünürsünüz ya, Suç ve Ceza da kesinlikle olaylara bakışınızı zenginleştirebilecek bir başyapıt.

"1735",1734,"Mat","This is quite simply the best book ever written. Period. However, you must read this translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Voloshonsky - they truly bring Dostoevsky's voice to life. All other translations are inadequate and should be avoided. "
"1736",1735,"Max","This was the first book of Dostoevsky's and it shall not be the last. Despite my initial reservations, this story about the nature of guilt and redemption captivated me from start to end. As between Sonya and Raskolnikov, these themes run throughout the story and unify it as a whole, leaving behind a sad yet hopeful vision of the human spirit.I learned from this novel that the great Russian storytellers are people whose work I should definitely read."

"1739",1738,"Mary","I'm not good at having one favorite of anything, but this book would be my favorite book of all time if someone put a gun to my head -- convinced me they would use it -- and insisted I select a single title."
"1740",1739,"Ashe","I thought the writing in this novel was excellent and I loved how the main character was written. I felt all the gloomy emotions he underwent in this novel. I can't wait to read another of this author's classics."
"1741",1740,"Nicole G.","While not a light read by any means, for a long novel it goes quickly. This upholds my fondness for Russian literature. We never had time to read this in class, which is an utter shame. I also did not know much about the plot before going in. While a crime is committed, that of Raskolnikov murdering the pawnbroker and her sister, the real crime is his arrogance and feeling he is above the law. Despite this, before the denouement, his punishment already begins, as the guilt over his actions begins to drive him mad. Dostoevsky combines SO MUCH in this novel. I can't say enough how fascinating it all is."
"1742",1741,"Rikke","I haven't actually read this version but an older Danish translation from 1941 (translated by Carl Nutzhorn-Kjersmeier) as I thought that would be closer to Dostoyevsky's original text. It's so beautifully written that I'm tempted to learn Russian just to be able to read the original! I shall not tire you with a review. Suffice to say that there is a very, very good reason this book is considered one of the greatest works on literature ever written."
"1743",1742,"Ahmad Kishki","I will definitely reread this.Second reading: ?First reading: (oxford) Often I would think of absurd actions and plan them. It is in the grip of my freedom to do any absurd action. The law may punish some of the more vile expressions of my freedom but it doesn't prevent the expression itself. The law is there for the establishment of justice, and has nothing to say regarding my freedom. If I shall not act in accordance to my freedom, it should then be my will to do so. But, then, what if I don't will to restrict my freedom, and decide to display my freedom in its most absurd? First let's ask if I am capable of it. An understanding of whether I am fit for freedom in its most abstract definition could only be understood in practicing it. Therefore, only by acting I discover whether it is fear that prevents me from acting or simply that I don't will it. What use then is this exposition? It may serve to show that by putting fear of the law aside, I am not an ordinary being - not better than the ordinary, but something different. After all, people around me act in the most mechanistic manner, living for existence itself. Wouldn't I by putting myself beyond good and evil, destine myself for greatness? Or at least know that I have the will power to change history? Haven't all the great people put themselves beyond the law, and at times even allowed murder for themselves? Am I great?These are some of the ideas that were troubling me as I was reading Crime and Punishment - I didn't know before hand that Dostoevsky would examine similar ideas through Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov demands to know whether he is great, and whether in a different existence he may have been a Napoleon. Raskolnikov commits murder. He supposes that the great don't reflect over their transgressions over the rules of the ordinary people, they simply regard it as a necessary step in the development of history. In a sense, the crime is the murder, while the punishment is the psychological suffering. Raskolnikov's journey tells me a lot about myself and the human condition in general. To some extent, Raskolnikov represents my suppressed ego, and a certain shade of my being.Crime and Punishment blends an unforgettable cast in an uncompromising setting, and the end result is a classic that i am not soon to forget."
"1744",1743,"Valerie Edwards","Loved it, one of my all time favorites!"
"1745",1744,"Levi Lovelock","Fyodor Dostoyevsky made me sick. Why? Because of his incredible writing abilities. He himself has known poverty and punishment, perhaps this story was his own emulation of what it would be like to have the mind of somebody truly guilty. What an incredible feat. For an old book, C&P read very well and did a strong job at building intense scenes. Heavily dialogue driven the text is rich with social nuances and queues flying everywhere. At times I felt sad that I was reading a translation, but other than that, I think it is now my favourite nineteenth century novel. Highly recommend."
"1746",1745,"Jake Mcatee","First intro to Dostoevsky Sophomore year and loved it. "
"1747",1746,"Jennifer Richardson","Obviously I have nothing original to say about this classic, but want to rant about its awesomeness in case any friends were on the fence about jumping into this book. I thought it would be a heavy undertaking, but was so pleasantly surprised to find it is instead an engrossing, smoothly flowing, easy-to-read page turner (once you've figured out all the names). How one man can know so much about human nature from so many different perspectives, on the superficial level of conversation and behavior as well as at the core of our psychology, is unbelievable. But reading the thorough descriptions of Dostoyevsky's numerous perfectly complicated characters never gets old, as there is not a single person in this book that is either simply ""good"" or ""bad,"" and they become more and more real as we learn more details and try and place them on the spectrum on which real human beings exist. Somehow at it's core it is both fundamentally absurd and strikingly real- it is also so witty and hilarious I laughed out loud dozens of time. Biggest flaw, however, is that some character ""fall's ill"" on pretty much every page so that gets a bit old I guess..."
"1748",1747,"Marwen","Now I get it all ! I do understand now, why Dostoyevsky is considered by some people as the greatest writer of all times. I just found out that even life itself , is like a big novel written by Dostoyevsky , and we're the doomed heros, playing our roles till the end of our lives."
"1749",1748,"Zaid","A masterpiece.This is the first of Dostoyevsky's book that I have read and yet it is amazing in every sense.The author succeeds in capturing the internal struggle within a criminal's mind while alluding to several other issues in the society."
"1750",1749,"Brent McCulley","Having traversed quite a number of Dostoyevsky's shorter works, early works, and short stories (The Double, Notes From the Underground, House of the Dead, Poor Folk, The Gambler, White Nights, An Honest Thief, Bobok, The Dream of a Ridiculous Man, and a few more short stories), I knew that it was high time that I whet my philosophical knowledge against Dostoyevsky's larger, more famous novels written in the latter portion of his life. Picking up first Crime and Punishment, having scheduled to go through Brother's Karamazov in the next few months or so.As it is with Dostoyevsky, Roskolnikov, the twenty-something year old former University student protagonist, is completely and utterly maniacal. The depths that Dostoyevsky dives psychologically into his mind is beyond impressive, and to be sure, carries the main motif and theme of the book. While I'm not going to use this review to simply summarize the contents therein--which you can find on any other website if you want to know the plot narrative--but rather, express some of my concluding thoughts upon completion of the novel.Roskolnikov kills an old pawn-broker, to be sure, he murders her in cold blood and kills her sister Lizaveta too--hacks them violently with an axe he stole from the local butcher shop. This is not your sophomoric and trite murder mystery; nay, it's psychological. Roskolnikov, who had gotten one of his University papers published in a Russian journal, had postulated an abstract theory about mankind being divided twain; viz., that there was the ordinary and the extraordinary. ""Ordinary men have to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because , don't you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they are extraordinary"" (205). The ethic propounded is one that allows for the individual to transcend morality, or at least the consequences therefrom; this is reserved only for the extraordinary class of humans, and for some sort of teleological purpose. Roskolnikov draws from the idea of a Napoleon-man, a great powerful man ""whom all is permitted [who] storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, forget an army in Egypt, wastes half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off with a jest at Vila. And alters are set up to him after his death, and so all is permitted"" (217). Roskolnikov has a seething, brooding lust to embody this type of extraordinary man, and to be sure, wants to see if this theory can be lived out existentially by not those written about in history books, but by himself. For he divined that ""power is only vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up. There is only one thing, one thing needful: one has to dare!"" (328). And so, as though fated by his circumstances, and propelled by the devil himself--self admittedly--he axed the pawn broker and her sister to death, later claiming that he ""didn't mean to kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the principle, but I didn't overstep"" (217).While Roskolnikov serves to capture the nihilism that had so engrossed his soul, and to be sure, acted upon principle in the frenzied and hysterical double murder, he failed to surpass one obstacle in his way: conviction. Embodied as truly delusional, and a schizophrenic maniac, Roskolnikov seemed to leap over whatever ethical bounds had been laid upon humanity, only to be continually tormented in his soul for something that he, in principle, did not think was morally wrong, but even, perhaps, morally advantageous, since after all, he merely ""killed a louse...a useless, loathsome, harmful creature"" (327). And even while he didn't feel remorse or regret for his crime, and certainly had no sense of either duty or obligation to become contrite and heart and repent--no mater how hard Sonia urged him to do, the religiously observant prostitute who becomes Roskolnikov's faithful lover by the end of the book, a paradox in itself--he could not shake the impending and dreadful feelings of panging conscious that plagued his soul. ""I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder with casuistry, to murder for my own sake for myself alone!...It wasn't to help my mother...[and] it wasn't the money I wanted...I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led me on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse like everyone else or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or not, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not"" (329). By the end of the novel, Roskolnikov turns himself in, and is exiled to Siberia for eight years in a work prison. Upon reflection of his past crimes, vis-a-vis his original ethical theory, he ruminated what hurt him most was not his feeling of remorse, or even his miserable conditions in prison, of which he declared are even better than the wretched conditions he was living in theretofore. Nay, what Roskolnikov was dejected by and utterly humiliated from was his wounded sense of pride. He had jumped over the ethical, only to be suspended by the universal--halted forthwith in his tracks by the pangs of his tormented conscious and soul. And worst of all for Roskolnikov, upon deliberating whether or not he was going to turn himself in, he had wanted to commit suicide, for the absurdity of his situation indeed called for him to do so. His sister's benefactor who was wealthy and fearful of death had the day antecedent to Roskolnikov turning himself in had done just that: blown his brains out. ""Why does my action strike them as so horrible? Is it because it was a crime? What is meant by crime? My conscience is at rest. Of course, it was a legal crime, of course the letter of the law was broken and blood was shed. Well, punish me for the letter of the law...and that's enough"" (425). And yet, Roskolnikov faltered, and something within him urged him to cling to life, but not in a heroic way, for he was not displaying Sartre's conception of the absurdity of live in light of radical freedom, but rather, in the most loathsome and cowardly way. ""He suffered too from the question: why had he not killed himself? Why had he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess?"" (425-426).Dostoyevsky's religious, ethical, and psychological themes of Crime and Punishment embody various other philosophical strands that I find utterly fascinating. First of which is the Kierkegaardean conception of the ethical as presented in his Fear and Trembling. The idea in the simplistic way possible is that there is in a sense the idea that the Knight of Faith usurps and transcends the ethical by an infinite resignation and by believing (faith) on the strength of the absurd, thereby setting the individual in absolute relation to the absolute. In contrast, the Tragic Hero utterly fails: why? Because he submits to the universal, or that is to say, the ethical, and in doing so, crumbled beneath the weight of the universal and becomes a martyr, and as such is praised for being one. But the latter character has not done anything noble indeed, but merely submit to the ethic already in place, and in this sense, he is ordinary, while the former is extraordinary, he is the Napoleonic in essence. Moreover, Nietzsche's concept of the Übermensch also transcends morality altogether, and makes decisions by the 'Will to Power' (c.f. Dostoyevsky, ""power is only vouchsafed..."" supra), from such lofty heights as he has broken from not only ethically, but psychologically as well. ""He who climbs upon the highest mountains laughs at all tragedies, real or imaginary...One does not kill by anger but by laughter. Come, let us kill the Spirit of Gravity! I have leaned to walk: since then I have run. I have learned to fly: since then I do not have to be pushed in order to move. Now I am nimble, now I fly, now I see myself under myself, now a god dances with me. Thus spoke Zarathustra"" (Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, I, aphorism X, On Reading & Writing). While Zarathustra and Roskolnikov's ""Napoleon"" share similar traits, the latter fails where Zarathustra succeeds; indeed, for Zarathustra has thrown of all conscious or conviction, and laughs at others in his lofty heights, whilst Roskolnikov is burdened to the point of surrender, cursing only himself for his lack of courage, to at least kill himself in light of his despicable circumstances.From the foregoing, then, what can be concluded? Dostoyevsky, who spends literally four-hundred and twenty-five pages to pain, torment, madness, psychological insanity, suffering, and absurdity thereupon, in concise yet profound manner, spends the final two pages with his last and greatest motif of the novel: such a subtle nuance that one could hardly even pick it up if they were not paying attention: redemption. Unlike the Übermensch who had succeeded in throwing of the pangs of conscience, Roskolnikov failed: and while he may have not understand in the moment the reason for his feeling so dejected and downcast, it was only upon later reflection that perchance, the truth of the matter came out; namely, that deep, way deep down in the bitter, resentful, egoist, nihilistic and cynical soul of Roskolnikov, he didn't kill himself quite precisely because ""he had perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and his convictions. He didn't understand that consciousness might be the promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his future resurrection"" (426).Yes, the absurdity of life, the sufferings therewith, and the innate and devious ways essential to human nature are all guaranteed in this life, and these might, perhaps, all be atoned for as Roskolnikov, in the end, realizes ""with what infinite love he would not repay all her sufferings...he was [now] simply feeling. Life had stepped into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out in his mind...Under his pillow lay the New Testament...but that is the beginning of a new story--the story of the gradual renewal of man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life"" (430). Yes, as it was for Dostoyevsky, so might it be with us: perhaps infinite love will save us all.-b"
"1751",1750,"Dilan","Rus edebiyatı ile tanışmam Dostoyevski'yle oldu ve ben bundan ne kadar mutlu olduğumu anlatamam. Dostoyevski'nin kitaplarını okurken kendimi kaybediyorum, yarattığı karakterlere bürünüyorum resmen.

"1753",1752,"Crishell","Crime and Punishment is one of my favourite novels. I love every bit of it.Sadly, I don't have a copy now. I gave my copy to my friend. I promised myself that I will read this once more and will continue to read books by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.I love Constance Garnett's translation and it left me with a good impression which made me want to read all of Dostoyevsky's novels. I want to try a different translation for Crime and Punishment and see if it will be as good or maybe better. I wish to be blown away a second time.Finally, it's hard to write a review of a book you loved. I see no flaws in this one... Perhaps the next time I'm going to read this, I might contribute something essential in this review... For the meantime, let me go back to my novels that doesn't require much reasoning."
"1754",1753,"Maron Anrow","I adore this book. The characters are rich, the story is unique and compelling, some of the dialogue is truly memorable, emotions are intense... Re-reading this was a pleasure, and I'm sure I'll read it again soon enough.The book has a few slow parts, but the good parts are just so good. I have such a clear picture of the scenes in my head and there were certain sentences I wanted to read over and over because they were so impactful and I just wanted to soak them up. I am a big Dostoevsky fan in general, and this is without a doubt my favorite book of his and one of my favorite books overall.I started my second reading of Crime and Punishment with the free Kindle edition available on Amazon, which is the Constance Garnett translation, while on an airplane. When I got home I wondered if the paperback edition I owned (and had read first) was a different translation (the Kindle book ""felt"" a bit different), and it was indeed. The version I read originally was translated by David McDuff and published by Penguin. For a while I had fun comparing the two different translations--Constance Garnett (which is an older translation) and David McDuff--and I ultimately chose to finish the last ~70% of the book with the McDuff translation. I of course can't comment on translation accuracy, but the McDuff translation is more engaging and easier to read. (And now that I've seen what a difference translation can make, I wonder about some of my other favorite foreign books--like The Count of Monte Cristo, The Brother's Karamazov, and Anna Karenina--and how I would feel about them if I read different translations. I read very old translations of The Three Musketeers and its sequel Twenty Years After, and both were challenging to read. In contrast, I read a new translation of The Man in the Iron Mask, which was a more fluent reading experience than the first two books even though the story itself was less enjoyable.)"
"1755",1754,"AZ","I was frustrated in the beginning by the character's perplexing antisocial behavior to the point of almost not continuing to read the book. But it progresses and develops into something absolutely beautiful. Very romantic notions, it is much more of a defense of what must have been the ""old world"" of Dostoyevsky against the ""new and modern"" ideas of the time. But in those romantic notions one often finds truth."
"1756",1755,"Rich Hasler","I am never sure what I should have expected. I find Dostoyevsky an incredible writer and does a phenomenal job on character development. I found some of the long parts, really long but in all I do understand why this is one of the greats of literature and wonder why it took me so long to get to it."
"1757",1756,"Marts  (Thinker)","Put quite briefly, Crime and Punishment, focusing on an event in a young man's life and his purpose for his actions, is an exploration of life, death, circumstance, poverty, conscience, conviction and confession..."
"1758",1757,"Slim Khezri","This is a heavy book, but it’s also an amazingly detailed look at the inner workings of the human mind and the repercussions of committing a crime. Woody Allen once said: ""Ready Dostoyevsky is like having a full meal"" I cannot agree more. This translation by Pevear and Volokhonsky is as close to the original Russian as one could ever find. While other translations offer the text in English, this version gives one the full flavor of the writing. The characters come to life and the words by Dostoevsky himself show his true mastery as a writer. I found this book riveting and difficult to put down. When Raskolnikov commits his crime I felt as if I was right there--my pulse was actually racing.This translation has made me hunger for more works by this writer. Thanks to Pevear and Volokhonsy's for taking the tedium out of reading Dostoevsky that the other, boring translations had done. They breathed incredible life into his work. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent."
"1759",1758,"doug bowman","I took a class called Dostoevsky and Kafka in college, which is when I read this book. I bet I was loads of fun to be around that semester."
"1760",1759,"Jace Davies","Ingesting this book was a watershed moment.This is literature! We're starving, murdering, drinking and freezing to death in the back alleys of Petersburg. We're watching despicable people do horrible things to good people, sometimes getting away with it, sometimes not. We're seeing people who simply cannot and will not elevate themselves out of venality. This is humanity, right here.Dostoyevsky is the final word on the abject emptiness of human morality, showing us that the material world favours the strong and the merciless, and that redemption is a sugarpill for those too weak to embrace the nihilism of the cosmos.There is a small set of transcendent novels, whose ideas confront us and fill our minds more fully and efficiently than any philosophical treatise could. The book is foremost amongst them."
"1761",1760,"Ioana","Another true Dostoyevski masterpiece. The story centers around the main character, Raskolnikov, a student who believes himself to be above the moral rules and ""inhibitions"" of all those around him. His philosophy is that “everything is allowed” to certain people, if only they have the guts to reach out and take it. In order to test his philosophy, he murders an old woman. The rest of the story focuses on his internal struggle with guilt and his own feelings of grandeur. He ultimately learns about love and humility from a young prostitute. It is difficult to describe this book, because I interact with it at a deeply emotional level. Dostoyevski has a way of constantly surprising me with such incredible little morsels of truth about human nature. I have yet to read any other writer that creates such soulful characters, so vibrant and real. Religion also plays a significant role here, as it does in most of his books. Overall, a fantastic read, extremely enjoyable and entertaining, not to mention deeply philosophical, questioning the very foundation of morality and right and wrong. Amongst my top ten books of all time.Just a note: I took a class on Dostoevsky in college, and was actually lucky enough to have a leading Dostoevsky scholar as my professor. She swore by the Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky translations as being the most true to Dostoevsky's writing, so those are the only ones I will read. "
"1762",1761,"Alisha Hayes","Dostoyevsky is one of the most detailed writers. He pulls one into the story and make you feel like you are a fly on the wall taking in all the minor details. Crime and Punishment is my favorite Dostoyevsky book by far."
"1763",1762,"Savinipop Savini","While working on a TV show of this name, I was given a copy of the book. I felt it was my duty to read it. 50 pages in I couldn't put it down. A simple crime and the fascinating character that goes about it are so well drawn that it makes you wonder if it is fiction. It is a true masterpiece and there is no question as to why we are still talking about this book. "
"1764",1763,"Scott","Crime and Punishment is a poignant look at humanity, the laws we create, and the ways we deal with what we see as truly right and wrong. Theory versus reality is an important theme. I highly recommend this book."

"1766",1765,"King Phoebe","I... did not think I would absolutely adore this book.I picked it up warily, thinking, well, it's a classic. I had no idea what it was about and bought it because of obligation. Reading this book was a fantastic choice of mine and I'm so glad I bought it, even if my edition is extremely roughed up and, well, well-loved. First of all, the way Dostoyevsky portrays human character is so fantastic. He doesn't confine his characters to one mode of being (ex. Susan is a positive person. Joe is a negative person). In fact, his characters are beautifully inconsistent, which absolutely strikes me as realistic, although Rodya Raskolnikov's quick changes of mood might come across as irritating to others reading. One moment Rodya could be grovelling and weeping and the next he's skipping and laughing. I think Rodya is a character that displays appropriate behavior for someone in deep depression, and I really did adore him throughout this book despite his questionable behaviors and actions. Rodya kinda reminds me of Hamlet -- his personality is so flexible and human, such a damned hero, the tragedian -- I couldn't help but love them.The plot was extremely interesting and very well thought out and detailed, even if I had some trouble following it (I think this is my own problem due to not paying enough attention to the names of characters and such). I love the little arcs of storyline -- Raskolnikov's crime, meeting Marmelodov, Porfiry Petrovitch trying to get with Dounia, Katerina Ivanovna's little arc, Svidrigailov's story, and then finally, the story of how Rodya's life goes on with Sounia. Speaking of that, I think this book had one of the most wonderful endings I've ever read. As someone accustomed to reading tragedies, I thought I knew where this was going. ""Oh,"" I thought, ""Rodya will surely end his life before he'd ever confess and go to jail. He's too intellectually restless to be confined for years, and the thought of being killed for his crime scares him too much."" This was wrong of me, as I failed to recognize the themes of the road to redemption in this story. Rodya faced his crime, his actions, and feeling genuinely remorseful, turned himself in to that life. He recognized that he had done a horrible deed even if he spent almost the entire book trying to convince himself that he was just. And, man, it just tears me up so much that Sounia was still willing to live with him and love him despite his attitude towards him. Their love is so messy and real. Rodya Raskolnikov was not like Svidrigailov. He didn't give in to his cowardice, he didn't give in to the fact that he wasn't getting what he wanted. He didn't give in to his suicidal thoughts, or his depression, or his anxieties. He looked at his fate head on and said, ""It's going to take 8 years, but I am going to put this behind me and start a new life with my friends and family."" MAN, I LOVED THIS BOOK. Sorry for the ramble. I'm just really excited and happy and MAN, DOSTOYEVSKY, YOU GENIUS! "
"1767",1766,"Ruth Ann","My friend in College gave me some Dostoyevsky to read and it really spoke to me. This is a bit of a saga and if I remember correctly it tool me a bit of starting and restarting to get into it. "
"1768",1767,"Jie","Amazing how much twenty years can completely change my perception about a book. Need to re-read the entire Russian literature. Did not like reading about suffering back then."
"1769",1768,"Emily Peters","It's two am and I'm finished. I'm dumbfounded and sad and relieved that I'm finally finished.I'm not going to be able to give Crime and Punishment a real review because I cannot do it justice. In the future I'll read this again and I'll know more and better and deeper what the author was driving at (and hinting at), and whether I agree or disagree.Mostly I am struck with how ingenuously Dostoevsky handled dark matters. There wasn't a single chapter that wasn't physically uncomfortable to read. I can't decide what I disliked more -- when I recognized elements of myself in the murderer in the story, or when I felt myself judging him for not being punished as much as I thought he should be. How the author combines meditations on God with the most grimy, shameful underbits of human psyche should seem mutually exclusive, but they really aren't. Dostoevsky doesn't shy away from exposing every ugliness a human being can commit or be subjected to, from murder to poverty to prostitution to rape to suicide. I think he had to discuss these matters in full in order to show God in full, or maybe the lack of Him.This book was so relentless. It's entirely unusual and I've never read anything like it. It was an incredibly worthwhile departure for me. I look forward to reading more Dostoevsky in the future."
"1770",1769,"Javier Muñoz albornoz","Qué manera de orquestar que tiene Dostoievsky, todo de la manera más extraordinaria y minuciosa posible para describir personajes y estados psicológicos. Al leer sentía cada conducta y pensamiento en un vaivén de justificaciones para desconcertantes actos posteriores. Genio lucido."
"1771",1770,"Mistr3ssquickly","Easily the best book I've ever read. Amazing characters, gripping story, very thought-provoking premise ... and I'll be damned if the ""bad guy"" isn't my favorite character.No I'm not talking about Raskolnikov.I'm not much in favor of analyzing this poor book to death; in my opinion, it's better to read it, let it bother you, discuss it with a friend over coffee, then read it again and again and again."
"1772",1771,"Pelo","Five stars are never enough for Dostoevsky novels."
"1773",1772,"Adam Sommer","The difference in Russian name usage for formal and informal situations makes it hard to keep characters straight at times but if read carefully this book is a true dive into the fragility of the mind."
"1774",1773,"Huligan","An incredible and insane story of a man's battle with himself to find reason, and to justify his own ego. But in the end when logic and reason fails, something more precious is found instead: life and love. A simple lesson, but hard to learn."
"1775",1774,"Ehsan Sharei","کند و کاوی که داستایفسکی در مغز ِ ""رادیون رومانوویچ راسکُلنیکُف"" در رمان ""جنایت و مکافات"" می‌کند بی‌نظیر است. سرشار از اندیشه است این کتاب. و هیچ ترسی هم در دلش نیست که اندیشۀ یک قتل را می‌پروراند و از منظر ِ قاتل سعی در توجیح ِ آن به نفع ِ بشریت می‌کند. گرچه دست آخر جنگ مغلوبه می‌شود و راسکُلنیکف راهی زندان، اما راهی که داستایفسکی در مسیر ِ بسط ِ تفکر می‌گشاید هر کسی را مجاب می‌کند که فکر کند و اندیشه‌اش را بدون ِ ترس بپروراند و حتی آن را روی جامعه‌اش نیز آزمایش کند. احسان."
"1776",1775,"Shofi Azure","This is the greatest classic novel that I've ever read. the way Dostoevsky brings the reader to go inside the character's psychological life is excellent. However, he is always bringing us back and forth and full of unimportant narration. but still, all is going very good."
"1777",1776,"Allison Ebner","I like the idea of the book and even the layout, but it wasn't the most well executed in my opinion. Dostoyevsky seemed to dwell too long on certain points, having his characters go on and on forever. Decent read, but there are a lot of other books I prefer to it."
"1778",1777,"Marvin","There are not very many works of literature that are as vastly entertaining and as immensely thought-provoking as Crime and Punishment. Not much else to say except ""AWESOME!"""
"1779",1778,"Speranca","First of all, I was amazed by this book. I have heard a lot about it, have seen the movie and read parts of it before but never the whole book. I was kind of sad that I haven't read it in the grammar school when I was supposed to read it, but I think I am much more happier that I have read it now. I feel like this is a book you should read after the adolescence, after gathering some life experiences when you can actually comprehend everything that's been said in it and the whole experience of Raskolnikov, his ideas, thoughts, acts and finally redemption. Loved it! "
"1780",1779,"Rick Johnson","This was the first Dostoyevsky I read and I found it a wonderfully disturbing read. The slow unravelling of the psyche following the crime, against the bleak Russian backdrop gives the novel a claustrophobic tone, almost making one feel as if you are inside Rascolnikov's head experiencing his mental breakdown. The punishment aspect is interesting as it appears to me that his self punishment on a psychological level is far worse than anything the outside world could ever inflict. For all theworks greatness the surprising theme of redemption contained in the denouement almost makes me feel that Dostoyevsky sold out and I have to be careful not to allow this to ruin everything for me. Perhaps this ending was influenced by Dostoyevsky's mock execution at the hands of the Russian government, using the redemptive aspect as some kind of catharsis? Anyway, this is a surprisingly easy read and though it's no Brothers Karamazov it's still very very good"
"1781",1780,"Lucka","For some reason it took me quite a lot of time to finish this book but, to my defence, I finished my bachelor degree and read about twenty or thirty other books for my thesis and finals during this time. Anyway, this is an amazing peace and I loved it. One of my favourites for sure."
"1782",1781,"Jay Adalid","Easily my top 1 book, full stop. detailed review to come."
"1783",1782,"Aroura","I read this in high school and loved it. I saw it on my shelves the other day and was flipping through it, then got caught up. I lent it out before I finished it again. Such an interesting look at the psyche of someone who could persuade themselves in the justness of a murder of an old women. Fascinating. Only downfall is it's difficult to keep track of the names. "
"1784",1783,"Owen Kendall","This might well be the best and most complete and fulfilling book I have ever read. Unbelievable. Read and read again, especially if you were told to read the book in high school when you maybe didn't catch the incredible depth of Dostoyevsky's vision."
"1785",1784,"Catherine Austen","Dostoevsky changed my life. I first read Notes from Underground when I was 18 or so and it was like a switch flipped inside me and I felt connected to literature as I never had been in younger days. His books are sort of flawed but it doesn't matter at all because they are just so good, it's like the flaw lets you feel the emotion or intent behind the work even more than if it were technically perfect (like a great singer who doesn't have a great voice). I don't know, though, I haven't read him for years. I might not be so moved now. I should reread. "
"1786",1785,"Juicybeatles","Yoksulluktan öğrenimine devam edemeyen üniversite öğrencisi Raskolnikov, toplum içinde bir parazit, fakir fukaranın kanını emen bir alçak olarak gördüğü tefeci kadını, toplumun yararı için kuralların ve kanunların yok sayılabileceği düşüncesiyle öldürür. Onun düşüncesine göre Likürg, Solon, Muhammed, Napolyon ve daha birçokları koyun gibi sistemin kurallarına uymaktansa, gerekirse dağ gibi ceset yığınları üzerinden geçerek insanlığa faydalı olmayı seçmişlerdir. Raskolnikov, toplumu bir parazitten kurtarmak adına böyle bir olaya cesaret ettiğine kendisini inandırmaya çalışsa da vicdanının rahatsız edici sesinden bir türlü kurtulamaz. ""Suç"" ve ""Ceza"" kavramlarının derinlemesine irdelendiği bu 700 sayfalık blok tuğla ebatlarındaki romanda; Raskolnikov'un ikilemleri ve iç çatışmaları ve nihayetinde bulduğu aşk ile yenilenmesi anlatılıyor."
"1787",1786,"Cheena","I first read this book for my Russian Lit class in college. I was hooked. Since then I have read it during different times of my life and each reading provides me with a different insight, one that I had not considered before. In college it was about idealism, is one above the law? The concept, the ideal of the Superman was very real to me back then as one is, arguably, at the peak of one's idealism when one is surrounded by the free flowing ideas and dialogues that a collegiate environment provides."
"1788",1787,"Alusha","What a great classic! A fantastic story! Even thou I never got to like the main character, I did respect his act at the end! I very much liked a few of the other characters, witch Dostoevsky described very vivid and accurate. I like the little conversations, that some characters had among each other, even thou these conversations did not directly have anything to do with the story, but they were very important to understand the story, and the actions of some characters. I also liked that you had to think a lot in the beginning, as in who is who, because Dostoevsky kept using similar names (very smart idea to confuse the reader!!)Over all a great book!"
"1789",1788,"Calvin","My second book of Dostoyevsky, another classic. This for sure feels more finished than ''The Brothers Karamazov'', no surprise really as the latter was meant to have sequels. The book itself is riveting, I read it in every free moment I had, and couldn't wait to find out how things would turn out. The thoughts and actions of the characters are so well described that one cannot help but be involved in the story and be slightly convinced by Raskolnikov's logic. I also found the description of life in Russia to be extremely interesting and I feel like I learnt a lot from it.The book is like a murder mystery seen from the point of view of the murderer and it really conveys welll the thoughts and actions of the murderer before, during and after the act. The ending is a bit too ''so the moral of the story is:'' but still enjoyable. It's a must-read and an easier read than Brothers Karamazov. I wish I had read this before Brothers and I would recommend anyone starting on Dostoyevsky to start from here."
"1790",1789,"Candy","An exhilarating, enthralling ride, filled with subtle, complex messages about conscious, faith, and dehumanization. Some would say there are useless subplots, and the ending was a slap in the face. I retort by saying, every little detail in the book was of huge importance, and the ending was suitably symbolical.One of the few books to have an impeccable impact on me. I was traumatized whilst reading it, and was even more traumatized when it ended. "
"1791",1790,"Dan Hatcher","Loaded with interesting ideas and lengthy dialogue. "
"1792",1791,"Clint Paul","Finished reading one of the longest books i've ever read !!! More classics , more classics please !! "
"1793",1792,"Kyle Beaudet","Almost 150 years ago Dostoevsky penned this brilliant piece of psychological crime fiction. As philosophical as it is thrilling this bit of classic Russian lit. will not leave you disappointed or bored. I highly suggest the story of Raskolnikov to anyone interested in Dostoyevsky or Russian lit in general who is looking for a starting point, very easy to read especially in comparison to his contemporary Tolstoy, at just about 400 pages the pacing is great and definitely worth your time. "
"1794",1793,"Bart Heeren","Just...wow.I can't really describe how I feel about this book apart from saying it is excellent, as every part of it felt so well composed and planned out, it is probably as close to a ""perfect"" book as I have ever come to read.While Ulysses might be an expansion of the internal monologue, C&P explores guilt and existentialism in a way almost superior to that of Camus, which is really saying something. You have to hand it to Dostoevsky - he can write some really dark subject matter if he wants.It is one of the only books where the plot is almost secondary, you don't need every waking detail of the situation, the story is told through the mind, and that's what got me. The thoughts, the questions, the solipsism, the self hatred and the guilt of Raskolnikov just combine to make a powerful, if sometimes obtuse read.I won't push this to be read by everyone, because it isn't for everyone. I had to read this five times to really get a grip on what was going on, and often I found myself just filtering words without understanding them. Reading a chapter twice, once unaided then once with a study guide really adds to the book, as you get to understand the deeper meanings of the novel, and also what the hell is going on in this guy's mind.All in all, C&P lives up to it's reputation. It is a classic, that clearly sparked many author's interests, an is to thank for almost all psychological thrillers around today.5/5"
"1795",1794,"IVAN CONTRERAS","Es uno de los mejores libros que he leído... el autor se sumerge en los pensamientos de cada uno de los personajes y relata de forma extraordinaria cada instante de lo que acontece en la mente de cada uno. Es una obra maestra."
"1796",1795,"Maurice","Excellent, due a re-read"
"1797",1796,"Dave Morris","There are some uneven patches because Dostoyevsky, like Dickens, is a genius working too fast. But whatever the flaws, genius is so rare that it always scores 5 stars. Reading the book you are drawn into a feverishly heightened reality as Raskolnikov's mind unravels under the strain of St Petersburg's ""gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soul"" until the whole city feels like an embodiment of his unacknowledged guilt.The translation I read was by Constance Garnett, whose choice of words seemed occasionally to come unstuck, particularly when reaching for a colloquial expression. But that does create a sense of strangeness that she may have intended."
"1798",1797,"Cathy Graham","My first, and still favourite, Russian book. "
"1799",1798,"Billy Menke","This book was beautiful, and I didn't even manage to read what seems to be widely regarded as the best translation. Crime and Punishment definitely began my love for all things Dostoevsky. Luckily, I happened upon a Pevear and Volokhonsky translation of The Brothers Karamazov for whenever I get around to reading it."
"1800",1799,"Connor Wasler","Though not as thought-provoking as the Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment is still an exemplary novel. Through Dostoyevsky's brilliantly portrayed character Raskolnikov, the reader is able to feel the torments and anguish that Raskolnikov goes through. In essence, it brings us into the mind of a murderer who is philosophically conflicted as to whether or not there is such a thing as an acceptable murder for the greater good of society. Furthermore, the novel brings into question if ""superior"" beings can transcend the laws set forth by their society. Lastly, the scenes dealing with the resurrection of Lazarus are amazing. Though Raskolnikov rejects religion, he finds redemption and his own resurrection in love. It's awe-inspiring how Dostoyevsky portrays his own ideals into a fascinating novel."
"1801",1800,"Earl","After reading this alongside The Brothers Karamazov, I guess Dostoyevsky provides the best cliffhanger endings that bring to light the experience of hope. "
"1802",1801,"Gustavo","Crime and Punishment is a great novel that really puts you in a certain environment and you actually feel like you are there. The recurring themes of alienation from society, the psychology of a criminal are all great. You get to explore Raskolnikov's (the main character) mind: his doubts, fears, deliria. This is the real heart of the story. It's not nearly as much about the crime, as it is about the punishment (psychologically, especially). You can really feel the poverty, the dirty city as you read on. Some chapters feel slow, but in hindsight I think that actually works to the advantage of the novel, because everything pays off.The only thing I did not like was that I found the names to be very confusing, especially at first. Overall, a great novel.9.5/10"
"1803",1802,"Anni","This is the book I just recently lost...in my house...I'm so bummed. I want to re-read. I'd love the philosphy behind it, well not the ACTUAL philosophy but rather just how it came it linked together. "
"1804",1803,"Bar Shirtcliff","loved it. again. oh, but this is a flawed translation. they think every kind of impassioned discourse is ""propaganda."" had to look these passages up in the Russian original to understand."
"1805",1804,"Ariel Lynn","This was my first foray into Dostoevsky, & I don't think I would ever want to read a different translator's interpretation. Specifically, I read Richard Pevear & Larissa Volokhonsky's translation. I only hope they have translated more of Dostoevsky's works.What I noticed immediately was that, even though the author had only described Raskolnikov walking around, interacting minimally with a few minor characters, it was so engaging that I didn't want to put the novel down. The entire book was like that; putting it down to go to sleep was SO HARD!At the end, when Raskolnikov was in prison, in exile, & he ended up in the prison's hospital, very sick again, I had thought the worst was about to happen. The ending was a pleasant surprise.My only words of advice (& this could be true for every book with a foreword or introduction included) would be: DON'T READ THE INTRODUCTION/FOREWORD FIRST! Even though it's at the beginning of the book, & it's natural to want to read it first, it gives far too much of the story away. It would be good to read after completing the novel & reading it over again to look for a different viewpoint, but it's not to be read first!If I could give this book more stars, I would. It's a simple, direct translation that is easy to read, but so engaging it's hard to stop. I couldn't recommend the book, & the specific translation, more."
"1806",1805,"Cliffside Park Public Library (NJ)","From the very start of the novel, the audience witnesses the dynamic of a character who is in a civil war...with himself. Rodion Raskolnikov, the protagonist (and quite arguably the antagonist) of this story thinks himself an extraordinary man who is above the law. In order to prove himself, he unfolds his plan to follow through a crime. However, he could never have predicted the unraveling of psychological distress that would ensue, and lead him to his true fate. I would highly recommend this novel to a friend because it does not follow the traditional views of good versus evil. Every character has a blend of ""morally correct"" and ""immoral"" qualities, which causes them to seem more human and thus more relatable. Combined with the novel's remarkable portrayal of psychological downfall, the concept of good and evil makes Crime and Punishment both an interesting and refreshing read.K.C.

"1807",1806,"DMREAnne","Crime and Punishment is my all time favorite book, and one of the few that I have read more than once. Written by Dostoevsky, this Russian masterpiece is truly one of the greats in literary classics. A dark, psychological tale, Crime and Punishment delves into the mind of a killer. Raskolnikov, the main character, is a highly intelligent young man who has a philosophy that there are people in the world who are ordinary, and others who are exceptional. He believes that he is one of the exceptional, and that sometimes exceptional people can be above the law to better humanity. Raskolnikov plans and carries out a brutal murder of a pawnbroker. He tells himself that he is justified as she cheated her clients, and also because her money would give him the start in life that a great man should have. But it is not the murder that fills most of the story; rather it is the psychological consequences of this heinous act, as Raskolnikov slips into a deep paranoia over his guilt, causing him to become more and more sickly. As time goes by, he can hardly stop himself from telling others about his crime. People, who care for him, along with his new companion, a policeman investigating the crime, cause Raskolnikove even further psychological stress, deepening his paranoia. The characters are interesting, and well developed, and the deterioration of Raskolnikov’s psychic, and the building toward the ending, kept me interested to the very last page, I could even call this classic tale a page turner. "
"1808",1807,"Anne","Fairly difficult to get through if you're an impatient and visual reader like me, but WELL worth the effort. Beautiful commentary on the human condition (as I suppose all good literature is)."
"1809",1808,"Brenton Gilmore","Now easily in my top 5 favorite books! I was not expecting to read this novel with such ease and excitement. It is both a suspenseful crime novel and a psychological thriller. It reads like modern day fiction but with an undercurrent of much more depth and reason than seen in the genre's current execution.Terribly excited to read it again knowing there is much much more to take from the novel. Also, i am now terribly interested in the life of Dostoevsky from reading the afterword."
"1810",1809,"Jessica","I couldn't tell you exactly why today, but this book hit me hard when I read it as a senior in high school. I haven't been able to work my way through it ever again, but for a time I called it my favorite book in the whole world. "
"1811",1810,"Nilesh","A book that truly transcends time.Set up in 19th century, poverty-filled St Petersburg, the book is devoid of almost any hope for most part. Hope is sucked out of the main tale uncompromisingly. The torturous effects of the abject environment on every major character's psyches, resulting in their stupefyingly intriguing interactions leads to a narration that is undoubtedly, simply a classic.As sipped in its time and place as the tale is, the book will connect with person of almost any time and age. Few books in nearly 150 years hence have perhaps had subtleties and nuances of human behavior and actions exposed the way this book has. In a way, the book almost makes one feel that any human's ability to introspect and internalize was at least as evolved in the nineteenth century as now if not more.Some of the scenes in the book are absolutely mind-boggling. The Marmeladov's tale of self-degeneration, the murder (as well as all the other chilling deaths), Raskolnikov's interactions with Svidrigaïlov and Porfiry, Katerina Ivanovna's dinner are not only shocking in the way they unfold but also impacting in the vividity and succinctness.A must read for anyone in to serious reading."
"1812",1811,"Julie Salyards","This is one of my favorite books. I re-read it every so many years and each time I find more meaning. Certainly there is apart of me that seems to enjoy darker works- who knows why, I'll ask my therapist! This is a classic; it leads the reader into Russian Society and it makes us ask important, universal questions regarding crime and our capasity to commit senseless acts. "
"1813",1812,"Kristin","I would have to say that this is my favorite book of all time. It's so amazing to follow a man through a murderous thought process. I can't believe this book was written when it was. It's as though it was written for modern day. Amazing, amazing book!!!"
"1814",1813,"Olivia","Best. Classic. Ever."
"1815",1814,"Mike Reiner","amazing"
"1816",1815,"Guillaume Riflet","Read the portuguese translation. Amazing author that explores the introspection of the mind in its characters like no other author can. Finally, shy introverted people have found a voice. Great writing technique."
"1817",1816,"Line","I read this book years ago for a Lit class in high school, but I had to add it because it's one of my favorite books. I'm glad I was forced to read it for an assignment because I probably would not have read it otherwise."
"1818",1817,"Janel","After I read this book I couldn't wait to read more classics. The author gets into the head of killers in a way that is almost scary. I loved this book when I read it and it is still one of my favorite books. "
"1819",1818,"Marty","A mystery in reverse, complete with lively sketches of St. Petersburg and eccentric characters. While Crime and Punishment is very tense and psychological, it's greater triumph lies in it's exploration of moral philosophy and peasant life. A stunning, brilliant book."

"1821",1820,"Milo Train","I love this book, and even yes... the ending. To accept that this was not a deus ex machina ending it is important to see the time and scope that this was written in. Firstly the mid 1800's was a time of modernization, much of this book is written as a struggle between the old and the new modes of though. This modern reform was a product of Alexander II and his reform was that of the free peasant and the liberal intellectual. Dostoyevsky was writing in the beginnings of communist Russian thought, and his ultimate reaction against it is seen in the end of Crime and Punishment. Raskolnikov finds his old ways, he finds his old religion, and he finds family. These things are the things that have kept Russia, and many other societies alive through the worst struggles and downplaying their importance on the human condition compared to ""rational intellectual thought"" is a common mistake of the collegiate."
"1822",1821,"Petko Bossakov","""Crime and Punishment"" may appear depressing at a first glance, but actually I think Dostoevsky's view of human nature is rather optimistic here. Among the many subjects tackled by this book, I could see a couple of ideas that seem to pop up repeatedly in different characters' stories:1) Everyone can be a master of their own destiny, as long as they have the determination, faith and courage to endure some suffering along the way. (view spoiler)[Sonya the prostitute manages to find a purpose in life just by having faith and persistence; her mother manages to stay alive and take care of her children against all odds, until she personally decides to give up and abandons her belief in God and in herself. Marmeladov loses his job and his life not because of unlucky circumstances, but because of his own weakness. Razumikhin does not have any money, power, or influence, but gets along and successfully helps the people he cares about, because of his persistence and positive outlook. Porfiry solves the crime because of his dedication to his work, even when he has no witnesses or evidence to work with. (hide spoiler)]2) However, nobody can control another person's destiny; if they try, they will fail. (view spoiler)[Luzhin tries to trick and manipulate Dunya into marrying and worshipping him; he fails. Svidrigaylov tries to use force to obtain what he wants, and fails. Raskolnikov tries to prove he has the right to decide who lives and who dies, and fails. (hide spoiler)] What's interesting is that, ultimately, their failure is not caused by some external factor, deus ex machina or whatever. They personally set themselves up for failure - they make mistakes and fail even though they have the intelligence and power to carry out their plans perfectly. It's as if people are genetically wired to mess up when doing something that they, deep inside, know is wrong."
"1823",1822,"Clay","This was an audio book that I completed on my daily commute. First I will review the audio production: The voice acting was top notch, the characters were differentiated but not flamboyantly done. The pace seemed a bit slow at times, but there is a ponderous feel to much of the book so this was suitable. In places, when Raskolnikov's thought and emotions were particularly fevered the pace picked up marked giving a gripping, edge of your seat type of feeling.Now for the book: This is the second Dostoyevsky novel that I have consumed, and it was an incredible experience. Much of this novel is spent dealing with the philosophical nihilism of late 19th century Russia and you can see the seeds of the Bolshevik revolution and Soviet atheism playing out. Raskolnikov has an idea which is a play on Ivan Karamazov's thought that without God all things are lawful. He has determined that truly great men have no responsibility to follow the law, and indeed all great men leave a a trail of blood in their wake (Raskolnikov idolized Napoleon).The novel move through Raskolnikov's crime, his mental break down, and finally his redemption. It is a hefty novel, but well worth the time and effort. Dostoyevsky has a robust view of redemption that doesn't involve the saccharine sentimentality that you see in much writing of this sort."
"1824",1823,"Marta","There's always one or two turning points in your life, and if you're lucky, sometimes you can pin the exact moment.

The world hadn't changed, but I had, and it was  amazing . "
"1825",1824,"Lisa Asanuma","Why do I love a book about a man with a murderous Napoleonic complex, whose path to redemption ultimately has questionable results? I don't know. Because (like in all Russian lit. I've read) the language is gorgeous. Because the detective is so cunning, and yet has that bit of mercy to him. Because every single character is so crisp and clear in my head, in a way that just doesn't happen in the average book today.And maybe in part because I've always pictured Raskolnikov as Patrick Dempsey, a la the 1998 version (though I've never seen that—I really must). I wonder if I would find him less sympathetic now that I truly can't stand Derek Shepherd? haha But I don't think so... not after having read this twice. Besides, young Dempsey and current Dempsey are hardly the same person in my head. It's the hair. It makes all the difference.Wow, Lisa, you took that from intellectual to shallow in .15 seconds."

"1830",1829,"Tim Kadlec","Everyone talks about this book so I figured it was about time I give it a read. True to what I had heard, it's a fabulous book. I am still not sure how Dostoyevsky made such a cruel main character also somehow sympathetic, but he does just that. As is the case with many of the great novels, Crime and Punishment is a rich book with many pauses in the main narrative for philosophical and historical discussions. Some may not enjoy the slower pace, but I find the side discussions fascinating—they add so much more nuance to our understanding of the characters and how they think. I highly suspect that this is one of those books that you can read over and over, picking up new details each time."
"1831",1830,"Adriana Scarpin","O mais impressionante nesse livro é a influência que este exerceu na obra de Nietzsche, assim como Ródia, o filósofo é um produto do seu tempo.

"1835",1834,"Adam Cherson","I rate this book a 4.68 on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being best. Determined to be a powerful man, the protagonist sets out to exercise his will to power. As he discovers, there is more than mere willfulness required and his attempt to put the Nitzschean ‘Superman’ philosophy into action leads to an unexpected result. Like all Dostoevsky, this book is a working out of philosophical ideas using real, well drawn, and engaging characters. The wonder is that the book works so well on so many levels. It can be read as a philosophy, theosophy, or simply a crime novel."
"1836",1835,"Robert","An amazing portrait of the struggle between the intellect, and the conscience,the mind, and the heart.I didn’t know it was possible to put some of the psycological struggles endured by Raskolnikov into words.A work of genius! "

"1838",1837,"Turner Adornetto","Crime and Punishment easily goes down as one of the best books I have ever read. Not only was the plot itself extremely engaging and mysterious, but the idea fueling the plot was astonishingly interesting as well. This, of course, being a story told from a seemingly innocent murderer's perspective, and also the subject of the main character's article, whether certain individuals have the right to disobey societal law. Being one who likes to ponder different philosophies and theories with people, the book very much appealed to me. Also, with an entangling plot with twists and turns that I can only compare to Great Expectations, Fyodor Dostoevsky kept me glued to the book from page one. I strongly recommend this book to anyone with interests in law, mystery, philosophy, or just a good read in general! "
"1839",1838,"Joshua Mooney","After reading The Brothers Karamazov, I just had to read more Dostoyevsky. Crime and Punishment did not disappoint me. As in Brothers, I enjoyed the dream sequences that torment Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov just as much as those that troubled Ivan and Alyosha. I also found Crime to be surprisingly tightly constructed, and filled with quite a number of surprising events that interrupt the course of the story. I found myself gleefully anticipating every encounter with the inspector Porfiry just as much as Raskolnikov dreaded them. This is a book that is still remarkably relevant to the modern literary landscape, and I could not help but draw parallels between the grandiose motivations behind the protagonist's violent act and the charged rants of today's bombers and mass shooters. One of the final dream sequences in the book's end, in which the protagonist, now in penal exile in Siberia, envisions all the world infected with the same self-righteous anger that has brought him into exile, left me fearful for the state of the modern world. At the same time though, it reminded me that feelings of rage and disenfranchisement among men are not new to my own little slice of time and space. I suppose that the love of Sonya for Raskolnikov, which seems to shrink the seven remaining years of his sentence into a time that seems as short as seven days, reflects how Crime and Punishment remains a great book to a twenty-first century reader. It may have been published about 148 years ago, but the depth of its characters ensures that they still feel as relevant as ones written half a year ago do. This comes highly recommended; it is well worth the time commitment."
"1840",1839,"Sam Erickson","Crazy Russian aristocracy are still crazy, but at least in Crime and Punishment they are clever. Like most classics of Russian literature Crime and Punishment is amazingly written, philosophical, complete, and entertaining. Yet this time, finally, I'd actually enjoy having a conversation with many of the characters. Especially Porfiry. "
"1841",1840,"Rita","É a 2ª vez que leio este clássico e só posso voltar a dar-lhe 5*. É sem dúvida uma obra-prima!É uma leitura lenta, que nos obriga em muitos momentos a parar para reflectir.É um retrato mordaz da sociedade da época. Cidades imundas, onde abundam os pobres e prostitutas, onde as instituições públicas não funcionam, onde a miséria humana é explorada ao mais alto grau. Durante todo o romance existe a luta entre o bem e o mal, o ter e não ter, o ganhar e perder, o eu e os outros, que divide a mente, o que faz com que Raskolnikov sucumba ao dualismo. A crise de consciência que se abate sobre ele, que quase o leva à loucura enquanto consumido por uma tortura interior, chega a ser angustiante.As conversas que Raskolnikov tem com o detective responsável pelo apuramento dos crimes, Porfiry Petrovich, são um tratado filosófico sobre o valor da vida humana.É interessante verificar que Raskolnikov nunca se arrepende de ter cometido os crimes e que consegue sempre arranjar justificações para tal acto. Aliás, o próprio Raskolnikov quando fala com o comissário dá o exemplo daquilo a que ele chama as pessoas vulgares – gente normal - e as pessoas invulgares – às quais não se aplica a lei e que podem por si só mudar uma sociedade.As personagens foram desenvolvidas na perfeição por Dostoyevsky que as criou todas tão diferentes umas das outras, mas com alguns pontos em comum como as fortes personalidades e a coragem que são características transversais a todas elas. São também elas uma ferramenta para a crítica que é feita à sociedade russa – gente miserável, louca, sem consciência e má."

‘Man grows used to everything, the scoundrel!’‘What if man is not really a scoundrel-man in general, I mean, the whole race of mankind – then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial terrors and there are no barriers and it’s all as it should be.’
Crime and punishment is an elegant treatise on the tragedy of crossing the civil line that lands Rashkolnikov in a delirium borne of guilt and realisation of his own folly at grandeur. A former student, who is taken with the idea of committing a crime, but not of the physical act it would propose but rather of the psychological border that would open up, wherein it closes upon and strangles the common and the ordinary. He is frantic at the realisation of his distinction of superiority, for he imagines himself a regular Napoleon. But he succumbs to his own mortal ideas and the journey that unfolds is a grand look, even dispassionate at times, on the moral accord. Though the protagonist is by all means a cold, hard murderer: colder still that he did not undertake the program for personal gain, since that would suggest necessity and desperation could afford a relief at such times, but rather to prove a point to himself, for at the moment the person is selfish and for all accounts inconsiderate of others close to him; Dostoevsky presents a frank analysis of the psychological trickle effect that assaults him, thereafter.  It is interesting to note that the story was based in a time, when the ushering of the Industrial Revolution had sunk the poor and the destitute to the harrowing depths of unimaginable drudgery, yet our protagonist, who is himself a victim of poverty, sought to commit the crime, as a means to pull himself out of the common, and afterwards refrains from making use of the gains so afforded. Rashkol, even on the way to commit the crime speaks of walking to his own execution, so in his rationale he had a hint of the breakdown of his faculties at the horrendous scheme, but still ventures to do the same, if only ‘by accident’. The implications of the story are a great many. From the cat and mouse game played by Svidrigalov, who by all means is a filtered version of Rashkol himself, Sonia with the yellow ticket who despite her social transgressions is awarded all the considerations in the story (a triumph!), the proud and honourable sister, etc the long and interesting list of characters, each a veritable repose of the social theory. The theories on the subject of crime proposes some credulous but interesting arguments. For instance, the idea that ‘crime is a protest against abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing more, no other causes admitted!’ laying all blame on the environs’ influence might seem ludicrous at first sight but demands a twice look when backed by the argument that ‘if society is normally organised, all crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest against and all men will become righteous in one instant.’ It’s veracity is pulled apart in shreds when taking into consideration Rashkol’s own motives, still it is interesting to ruminate on the concept to some degree. There is a theory of the red string of fate in Chinese philosophy that propounds the belief that an invisible string of fate connects everyone in an intricate spider web, such that though each living soul be dancing to its own rhythm is inevitably connected and hence, influenced and in turn influences, the others. Though loosely connected to the novel at hand, I found myself inevitably reminded of it, again and again, throughout my reading. For when Rashkolnikov’s crime sets him on journey of self realisation, he seals the fate of those connected to him. It would seem childish folly to imagine one exempt from the trickle of the elegant design, but the suffering carved by one’s own intentions bestowed, however unintentionally, ...but well, like Rashkol, maybe I am playing a fool’s gambit. But a case has been made for suffering.In the Notebooks for Crime and Punishment, Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky puts in writing on the main point of the novel:
Man is not born for happiness. Man earns his happiness, and always by suffering. There is no injustice here, because the knowledge of life and consciousness (that is, that which is felt immediately with your body and spirit, that is, through the whole vital process of life) is acquired by experience pro and contra, which one must take upon one’s self. (By suffering, such is the law of our planet, but this immediate awareness, felt with the life process, is such a great joy that one gladly pays with years of suffering for it).
After reading this, I am bemoaning my late discovery of Russian Literature. I have yet read only a few that belongs to this distinction, but of all that I have read I am amazed at their sheer brilliance. So much so that I am considering moving full time to this part of the literary world. Although that might be unrealised, I am ready to remedy the sparse collection of the greats of Russian Literature currently adorning my shelves. "
"1843",1842,"Daniel Mcbrearty","Made me realise why they call him ""The Father of Psychology"". Like all the really great ones, it is his compassion and insight into the human soul that is remarkable. It's a long, slow read, and quite dark in many places. Yet, he somehow extracts (eventually) a sense of peace and even hope from all this, as the book closes with the deranged murderer slowly making his penance to society."

"1847",1846,"Jared Mcswain","Simply put, Dostoevsky's prose is brilliant. An excellent writer. With that being said, there are some problems with him as a novelist, however.This is one of Dusty's early ""serious"" writings. It is by no means in league with the Brother K and has obvious marks of a progressive, but immature, novelist. This book was written right after Notes From the Underground, and in that novel Dusty essentially lays out what his earliest existential ideas, i.e. the first fifty freakin' pages contain a pseudo-intellectual self-acknowledging contradictory ranting about individualistic validation. One could also take away that Notes is an obviously immature novel as not much happens plot wise beyond (I think) five examples of the existential individual reacting to his environment. Crime and Punishment is an expansion on those concepts laid out.The end result: about two hundred unnecessary pages of sometimes sloppy plot and seemingly round but in reality flat characters that exist only to parallel the main characters ""punishment."" I guess that's a Russian flaw though, I've heard War and Peace has about fifty irrelevant side characters. To sum it all up: Dusty uses his excellent prose to throw some really cool- and at the time, groundbreaking- ideas around, e.g. individual enigma, existentialism, nature v. nurture concerning morality, mind-body relationship, etc. but does so in a way that polarizes the reader by loosely exploring every possible rabbit hole existing between the two main events: the Crime and the Punishment. A must read for aspiring writers based on the style and diologue alone, but for the casual reader, the story is too simple and the names are kind of ridiculous for this to be considered a light read. Raskolnikov felt sick, he did indeed. "
"1848",1847,"Organicearthful","While initially a little difficult to get into, the factual details of the first half of the book, which can be somewhat laborious, pale into insignificance as the psychological drama in the second half of the book unfolds as a remarkably telling expose of the human mind. Especially liked the parallels between Svidrigailof and Raskolnikof, which only became apparent after I had finished."
"1849",1848,"Deidre","Fyodor Dostoevesky. Crime and Punishment, Trans. Constance Garnett. New York: The Heritage Press, 1938.Dostoevesky – Russian writers - influenced me greatly when I was in my early twenties, so I decided to reread a few, and I started with this one. I forgot that Raskonikov is described as handsome (4) and even though he is despicable, and extremely difficult to like, his friends and family forgive him his crimes. I remembered the book correctly: The crime is premeditated and Raskonikov hasn’t a good reason for the murder, which turns into murders. Raskolnikov even thinks about the hat he is wearing, which he feels is too conspicuous and must be changed to blend in with a cap of a common sort. He muses and dreams about murdering the neighborhood pawnbroker for days and decides to do it after he overhears a conversation between an officer and a student about good and evil. They discuss the pawnbroker’s sister, Lizaveta, whom they describe as good and who is abused by the old “hag.” (80) Raskolnikov thinks that the murder would serve as an example of how the world would be better off if the evil pawnbroker were dead.“ ‘Listen…on one side we have a stupid, senseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply useless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she is living for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case…On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away for want of help and by thousands, on every side! A hundred thousand good deeds could be done and helped, on that old woman’s money which will be buried in a monastery! (The old pawnbroker wouldn’t even leave the money that was earned on the back of the sister, for one, to the sister. She wanted all of it to go to the monastery so they would say prayers for her soul.) …dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from vice, from the Lock hospitals – and all with her money. Kill her, take her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of humanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousands would be saved from corruption and decay. One death, and a hundred lives in exchange – it’s simple arithmetic! Besides, what value has the life of that sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence?’ “ This is what R overhears and this is exactly what he had been thinking. It’s his rationalization for murder. Later he happens by the market and hears the pawnbroker’s sister, Lizaveta, talking to a couple who convinces her to come by that evening at a specific time. He realizes that he now knows that the pawnbroker will be alone in her flat. He decides that because he overheard both conversations it means he should do it. R goes to the flat, tricks the pawnbroker into letting him in and then brutally, free of guilt or regret, and proceeds to bludgeon her to death with an ax. He does steal a few things, but it is later pointed out that he left a huge sum of money still in the flat. When the sister, described as sweet, passive, good, and kind, returns early, Raskolnikov does not hesitate to kill her as well. He does not show any remorse about her death either.Sub-plots abound – his sister, Sonia, the Madonna like character who had to turn to prostitution to save her family financially; the evil fiancé of his sister’s, a strange man who exploits his sister when she was a governess in his house and who eventually kills himself; and the deaths of Sonia’s father, who when drunk is run over by a carriage; and, later, his widow, who dies a terrible death by TB. Russian writers of the time do not lack for drama.Long discussions take place among the many characters about democracy, nihilism, early communism, science, psychology, religiosity, criminology, free marriage and communal living (424), and women’s equality (423). There is talk about the mental environment of a crime (392). It’s very interesting because the lead lawyer/detective plays with R. He believes R committed the murders even when someone else confesses to the murder.Raskolnikov proclaims to Sonya that he has only “killed a louse” (479) and that he murdered two people because he wanted to “have the daring, Sonia! That was the whole cause of it!” Despicable. She’s shocked by what he says, but she stays by him. (481) “I wanted to murder without casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone!…I did the murder for myself, for myself alone…”Raskolnikov believes his has the right to murder because he is not common - the “genius” rationalization. He is above everyone else and doesn’t have to live by society’s rule. He is like any dictator who brings death and destruction to his country or to the country of others. Is there any greater evil? After he confesses and is sent to Siberia, where Sonia follows him, he does not repent. In fact he spends a lot of time thinking and describing, in different ways, the strength of anarchy. Dostoeyevsky ties it all up in the end and not all that convincingly."

Ho iniziato le lettura di Delitto e castigo un po’ titubante, come mi accade sempre quando inizio un libro da cui mi aspetto molto, e devo ammettere che all’inizio ho faticato un po’ a farmi coinvolgere. Poi, ecco il colpo di fulmine: ancora una volta, pur descrivendo un uomo che vive a Pietroburgo nel XIX secolo, ecco che il caro Dosto parla di me. E allora mi sono sentita sempre più attratta dalla narrazione, e non solo per Raskòl’nikov, ma anche per tutti gli altri personaggi e per le vicende che, come ormai il Dosto mi ha abituato, si intrecciano, evolvono, modificano tra loro.

"1860",1859,"Tim Cole","Reason for reading:I had never read The House Of The Dead... or The Brothers Karamazov... or The Idiot... or any of Dostoevsky's works. There was a gaping hole in my literary knowledge and while I am similarly unaquainted with Tolstoy, neither War & Peace nor Anna Karenina have ever enticed me. Maybe one day. Dostoevsky was different. He had epilepsy and died from a hemorrhage as a result of a seizure. That is one reason I am drawn to him. The fact that I love St Petersburg (although it was Leningrad the two times I went there) is another. A mix of politics, religion and psychology. The presence of the roots of existentialism. Agonising reflections on his time in exile in Siberia. And ultimately the fact that Crime & Punishment appears on just about every list of 'best/greatest/most influential' books of all time is a pretty good reason to pick it up to find out why.About the book:A destitute former student, Raskolnikov, plans and incompetently commits a murder. It seems at first this is done purely with the aim of easing his parlous financial state, but it transpires that he has a long-held belief that there are those with a higher purpose who can act in ways that are above the law in order to achieve greater things. He sees himself as a Napoleon figure and wants to test himself to see if he can 'step over' such an act into greatness. His own punishment of inner torment is at the core of what is largely a bleak tale of human suffering. He plays mind games with the police chief investigating the crime. His relationship with his mother and sister and his sister's various suitors of all backgrounds provide a series of complex entanglements for him to cope with. And the prostitute Sonya and her family offers some chance to persuade him into an act of redemption.Quote, unquote:He walked out; he was reeling. His head was spinning. He could not feel his legs under him. He started down the stairs, propping himself against the wall with his right arm. It seemed to him that some caretaker with a book in his hands pushed him as he climbed past on his way up to the office, that some little mutt was barking its head off somewhere on a lower floor, and that some woman threw a rolling pin at it and shouted. He went on down the stairs and out into the courtyard. There in the courtyard, not far from the entrance, stood Sonya, pale, numb all over, and she gave him a wild, wild look. He stopped before her. Something pained and tormented, something desperate, showed in her face. She clasped her hands. A hideous, lost smile force itself to his lips.He stood a while, grinned and turned back upstairs to the office.What was good:Raskolnikov is possibly the finest protagonist to grace any tale that I have ever come across. He makes the book as exciting a read as you can imagine and the frantic pace as he lurches from one psychological trauma to another, with explosive human relationships combusting all around him is staggering. There are mental cat-and-mouse games played with the police chief, Porfiry Petrovich, to match ones you've read in any thriller. His sister, Dunya, friend Razumikhin, and the array of wonderfully-created other characters light up the book. It means that the appalling oppressive poverty of pre-revolutionary Russia is never suffocating even though the book is a very dark one. You are sucked in though, to Raskolnikov's world and his fevered state of mind. There is a twisted love story with his powerful relationship with the young prostitute Sonya and real comedy offered at the funeral wake for her father. Every word is worth dwelling on, even with some of Dostoevsky's single paragraphs running to three pages, although a spell-binding plot drags you along at breakneck speed. This truly is a great work and is on all those lists for good reason.What wasn't good:The epilogue wasn't quite what I had hoped for - or at least in the final pages. Whether that counts as a flaw or not I don't know. It's more a reflection of my own beliefs I suspect."
"1861",1860,"Machel","On Tuesday, I was telling Robin after we voted about one of my favorite novels of all time: Crime and Punishment. I explained to him in detail about this book regarding the plot and how it reveals so much about society, the difference between right and wrong and then finding out what the meaning of life is truly about. This book tells that story!Last night I cleaned out one side of my closet. And wouldn't you know it in the midst of heap of books this one fell on the floor. It's a sign! Yes, I believe in fun things like that. I haven't read this book since the mid 1990's and I am thrilled to be rereading it again. What a perfect book for me to find, to anchor into and to remember and discover deep and darker secrets in this life. I cannot wait to reach it's end. Sonya!! I am rooting for you.

"1865",1864,"Savanna","	Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment is largely a meditation on the nature of freedom and self-determination, wherein the protagonist, Raskolnikov, makes an important decision to commit murder and is forced upon an intricate quest to rationalize and justify his crime while discovering the consequences it imposes upon his own identity. The implied author makes use of secondary characters as ‘doubles’ of his protagonist, representing possible identities of Raskolnikov in his search for his own selfhood and its meaning. With the character Porfiry Petrovich, Dostoevsky mirrors Raskolnikov’s superficial mannerisms as well as essential components of Raskolnikov’s identity: the coldly rational, educated intellectual, and the dedicated ethical idealist. This mirroring of Raskolnikov eventually helps him to come to terms with his own identity through moral expiation of the crime.	Firstly, the implied author uses the character of Porfiry Petrovich to mirror his protagonist’s superficial peculiarities. While Raskolnikov is often ill and feverish throughout the novel, Porfiry Petrovich, too, seems to be prone to constant ailment. He complains about his weak constitution, and confesses that he’s “often afraid of an attack of paralysis” (273). Similarly, both men are prone to inappropriate outbursts of laughter, as Porfiry Petrovich himself confesses (Ibid). The implied author’s likening of both men’s proneness to sickness and their peculiar tendency towards fits of laughter helps to draw attention to less superficially obvious similarities between the characters: their staunch rationality and ethical idealism. 	Raskolnikov, especially in the beginning of the novel, attempts to view his murdering of Alyona Ivanovna as a rational, emotionless and deliberate decision, and Porfiry Petrovich serves as a manifestation of this kind of intellectualism. During their first encounter, Porfiry Petrovich addresses Raskolnikov’s concerns “coldly” and with a “businesslike air” (204). This frank, utilitarian disposition parallels Raskolnikov’s own coldly calculated motives for murdering Alyona Ivanovna as outlined in his article on the conditional permissibility of the criminal behaviour (211-212). Here, both the examining magistrate and the rational Raskolnikov seem to have alienated themselves to some extent from ordinary sentimentality in favour of a calculated, rational mentality. Like Raskolnikov, Porfiry Petrovich is quick-thinking and constantly calculating, as when he deals with the surprise of Nikolai’s unwelcome confession by immediately attempting to logically refute the confrontation and observing that “it’s not his own tale he’s telling” 286). Throughout the novel, Porfiry Petrovich remains determined and collected in his pursuit of Raskolnikov, and this steadfastness embodies Raskolnikov’s own adherence to rationality. As Marina Turkevich Naumann writes, Porfiry uses his own rationality to convince Raskolnikov of the error in his own reasoning. She writes that “Porfirij is cognizant of the fact that Raskol'nikov cannot live with this guilty conscience,” and that he starts “echoing all of Raskol'nikov's theories” to [drive] him into a frenzy [of doubt]” (48). Porfiry thus uses his capacity for rationality to appeal to Raskolnikov’s own reason, and by ‘doubling’ his own premises causes him to reject them. Having thus disarmed him of his rational justification, Porfiry Petrovich is then used by the implied to double Raskolnikov’s idealism and drive him towards confession.	As well as ‘doubling’ Raskolnikov’s quick rationality, Porfiry Petrovich mirrors Raskolnikov’s ethical idealism. Like the idealistic Raskolnikov’s motivation for murder, Porfiry Petrovich’s primary concern in solving the crime is also moral one. He describes himself as “a man of heart and conscience,” (369) not unlike Raskolnikov with his warped utilitarian motivation for murder. He seems to take a genuine ethical interest in Raskolnikov’s spiritual redemption through confession, as though his foremost objective in solving Alyona and Lizaveta Ivanovna’s murder is to redeem the perpetrator. Porfiry Petrovich’s own ideal is that confession and punishment lead to a morally “great expiation” (376). Indeed, he is so passionate about Raskolnikov’s moral redemption through confession that he displays such sincere “alarm and sympathy” towards Raskolnikov that Raskolnikov himself “[looked] at him with wild curiosity” (279). This fervent idealism parallels Raskolnikov’s attempts to adhere to his own moral imperative. Both men seem to have devised their own ethical frameworks, and both are profoundly devoted to their respective ideologies. Thus, the character of Porfiry Petrovich is used by the implied author as a double of the protagonist with regards to his strong and profound idealism. This notion of Porfiry Petrovich as a mirror for Raskolnikov’s conscience is strengthened by his foreshadowing of Raskolnikov’s later redemption through confession to himself under suffering (377).	William Burnham writes that, “What makes Crime and Punishment a true psychological thriller, however, is the fact that the confession before Porfiry Petrovich is a legal necessity for Raskolnikov's undoing” (1236). This, however, overlooks the fundamental importance of Porfiry Petrovich as a double of Raskolnikov’s idealism: the confession is necessary not for Raskolnikov’s undoing, but for his redemption. Porfiry Petrovich is not interested in ruining Raskolnikov, but in redeeming his “conscience” through “punishment” (215). By compelling him to confess, Porfiry Petrovich represents the reasonable and ethical dimension of Raskolnikov which, having rejected its initial criminal theory, now longs for redemption through confession. Thus, Porfiry Petrovich urges Raskolnikov to confess not in order to ruin him, but to make atonement for his wrong. In this way, Porfiry Petrovich’s ‘doubling’ of Raskolnikov’s ethical idealism ultimately induces his own repentance and moral expiation.	Thus, the implied author in Crime and Punishment uses the technique of ‘doubling’ Raskolnikov’s superficial peculiarities, adherence to rationality, and ethical idealism through Porfiry Petrovich to depict Raskolnikov’s own struggle with his identity in the aftermath of his crime. By mirroring Raskolnikov’s character, Porfiry Petrovich both disarms him of his rational justification for the crime and appeals to his idealistic nature to induce his repentance. Dostoevsky employs this technique of ‘doubling’ his protagonist to develop the novel’s themes of guilt, repentance, and the search for identity.

Having taken a long break from 19th century literature it was hard, but worth it, getting back to the brutality of the industrial setting and the philosophical musings of the characters. The book being Russian, too, I thought there was an interesting element of economical philosophy as well. And the title: it should actually be ""Crimes and Punishments"", there are so many in there. LOVED IT!"

And not in the way I expected it to be.I read this at a time when most books, especially contemporary books, come across as not just boring, but also pretentious. What's so refreshing about this book is it's a suspenseful story about passionate people in twists of fate they don't understand.Also, I can't remember the last time I read a book with this many good scenes and dialogue. It's rare to read a book where the author relies almost entirely on conversations between characters to run the story."

The moral ambiguities and Nietzsche-esque ideas are all dealt with by Dostoyevsky like he knows human nature inside out.I can't say the book is easy to read, not that it requires a genius to read it's just exceptionally detailed about almost all thoughts and feelings the characters have, but it's alldone in a way that you need to keep reading.I also don't think Svidrigailov is the bad guy he's made out to be, I felt quite sorry for him."
"1873",1872,"Leashia Hoehn","The reason i think so highly of this book isnt because it is so fast paced but because of the depth of understanding and exploration that the author gave to it. It was fasinating to me how the things we do effect our perspective of people and events. Very good book."

"1875",1874,"Arman Raina",". While it is probably not the ideal novel for a school project, I do not regret reading it. I chose this novel because I read War and Peace over the summer and it was my first exposure to Russian authors. I enjoyed that novel immensely, and would have read another novel by Tolstoy if I hadn’t encountered this quote from Nietszche, “Dostoevsky,the only psychologist from whom I've anything to learn.” Nietszche was famous for the claim that “God is dead”, while the little I knew about Dosteovsky was that he was an avid Christian. This contradiction led me to read a novel by him, Crime and Punishment, as it was his most acclaimed.The portions of the novel that I enjoyed the most were the one’s involving Luzhin or Pyotr Petrovich, the rather pompous fiancé of the protagonist’s sister, Dunya. The atmosphere of the book was very heavy at times and the mishaps of this character provided some sort of relief. There were many occasions in which he attempted to impress, outwit or trap Raskilinikov, only to be ripped to shreds by the main character’s sharp mind, acid tongue and furious temper. A good example of this is Raskilnikov’s late interjection into an argument about the recent death of a pawnbroker and the relevance of traditional morality between Pyotr Petrovich and Razumikhin, a student. Raskilnikov ridicules Pyotr Petrovich, and then accuses Luzhin of taking advantage of his sister. Luzhin is utterly lost.  “…if I were told ‘love thy neighbour,’ what came of it?” Pyotr Petrovitch went on… “It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both were left half naked... Science now tells us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on self-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly and your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private affairs are organised in society… better is the common welfare organised too… “ “…another circumstance interests me in the case…what strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes, too, crime is increasing proportionately. And if this old woman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by some one of a higher class in society—for peasants don’t pawn gold trinkets—how are we to explain this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society?”“What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he was forging notes? ‘Everybody is getting rich one way or another, so I want to make haste to get rich too.’”… [Replied the student]“But morality? And so to speak, principles …” “But why do you worry about it?” Raskolnikov interposed suddenly. “It’s in accordance with your theory!” “In accordance with my theory?” “Why, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and it follows that people may be killed …” “Upon my word!” cried Luzhin. Raskolnikov lay with a white face twitching upper lip, breathing painfully. “There’s a measure in all things,” Luzhin went on superciliously. “Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to suppose …” “And it is true,” Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in a voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, “is it true that you told your fiancée … within an hour of her acceptance, that what pleased you most … was that she was a beggar … because it was better to raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control over her, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?” “Upon my word,” Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably, crimson with confusion…
Whenever the investigator Porfiry Petrovich interrogated the protagonist, I felt increasingly uncomfortable. Dostoevsky was able to create an incessant, prickly atmosphere in these scenes. I often felt as if I, and not Raskilnikov, were being toyed with. The possibility of him giving himself away, added to the anxiety. These scenes were also quite long, and it took patience, perseverance and maybe even resilience to plough through them. An acute example of this occurs when Rodya Raskilnikov is summoned to explain his relationship to the deceased woman. Idle details, circular discussions and Raskilnikov’s self-awareness combine to agonise the reader.
“I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me … formally … about my acquaintance with the murdered woman?” Raskolnikov was beginning again. “Why did I put in ‘I believe’” passed through his mind in a flash. “Why am I so uneasy at having put in that ‘I believe’?” came in a second flash. And he suddenly felt that his uneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the first looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, and that this was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were quivering, his emotion was increasing. “It’s bad, it’s bad! I shall say too much again.” “Yes,yes,yes! There’s no hurry, there’s no hurry,” muttered Porfiry Petrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim, as it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table, at one moment avoiding Raskolnikovs’ suspicious glance, then again standing still and looking him straight in the face.	 His fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rolling from one side to the other and rebounding back. “We’ve plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? Here, a cigarette!” he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. “You know I am receiving you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, my government quarters. But I am living outside for the time, I had to have some repairs done here. It’s almost finished now.… Government quarters, you know, are a capital thing. Eh, what do you think?” “Yes, a capital thing,” answered Raskolnikov, looking at him almost ironically. “A capital thing, a capital thing,” repeated Porfiry Petrovitch, as though he had just thought of something quite different. “Yes, a capital thing,” he almost shouted at last, suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and stopping short two steps from him. This stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the serious, brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor. But this stirred Raskolnikov’s spleen more than ever…
Dostoevsky’s ability to create complex, realistic characters is his greatest strength. Each character has an almost contradictory dual-nature. Luzhin is progressive yet elitist; Sonya, a prostitute, is hardened yet innocent; Svidrigailov, Dunya’s former employer is depraved yet generous; Dunya herself is assertive at times and submissive during others. Finally, Raskilnikov is cold-hearted yet pitiable. The most telling example is Svidrigailov, who is infamous for attempting to seduce Dunya while she was under his employment, despite being married and a great deal older. The duality is exhibited in the scenes when he attempts to blackmail Dunya and then gives away a great deal of wealth. Svidrigailov tells Dunya that Raskilnikov is on the verge of arrest, and that he is the only person who can ‘save’ him. 
) “You … one word from you, and he is saved. I … I’ll save him. I have money and friends. I’ll send him away at once. I’ll get a passport, two passports, one for him and one for me. I have friends … capable people.… If you like, I’ll take a passport for you … for your mother. … What do you want with Razumihin? I love you too … I love you beyond everything.… Let me kiss the hem of your dress, let me, let me.… The very rustle of it is too much for me. Tell me, ‘do that,’ and I’ll do it. I’ll do everything. I will do the impossible. What you believe, I will believe. I’ll do anything—anything! Don’t, don’t look at me like that. Do you know that you are killing me? …”[Later, he visits Sonya] “I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,” said Svidrigaïlov, “and as I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some arrangements. Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said to you, you need not tell me.” (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) “Those people have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and your brother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them I’ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments. You had better take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, take them! Well, now that’s settled. Here are three 5 percent. bonds to the value of three thousand roubles. Take those for yourself, entirely for yourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no one knows of it, whatever you hear. You will need the money, for to go on living in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no need for it now.”
While Svidrigailov is a minor character, the duality is clear and in high contrast. At one moment he is a lechy, creepy old man, the next moment he seems a considerate benefactor. Svidrigailov is under no obligation and gains little from this generosity. Svidrigailov was at most an acquantice of the impoverished Sofya Semyonovna. However, the reader is not disbelieving, since this gesture is within the spontaneous, generous character of Svidrigailov. Svidrigailov, old yet childish, matures after this confrontation with Dunya. This duality allows Dostoevsky to surpass conventional narratives of not only ‘good’ and ‘bad’, but also complex yet static characters. Dostoevsky’s characters are always in transformation, and that is really what provides them authenticity. It is difficult for an amateur writer like myself to comment on the weakness of an iconic author like Dostoevsky. However, in my opinion the negativity of the book would probably be its greatest weakness. The numb, drilling thoughts of Raskilnikov are explored for pages on end. Furthermore, each scene is experienced through his eyes, making even a party scene frustrating and agonizing. Possibly the most depressing image is the childhood flashback of a horse being beaten to death.
He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whipped across the eyes, right in the eyes! He was crying, he felt choking, his tears were streaming. One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across the face, he did not feel it. Wringing his hands and screaming, he rushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was shaking his head in disapproval. One woman seized him by the hand and would have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back to the mare. She was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more.	  “I’ll teach you to kick,” Mikolka shouted ferociously. He threw down the whip, bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long, thick shaft, he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort brandished it over the mare.	 … “It’s my property,” shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a swinging blow. There was a sound of a heavy thud.	  “Thrash her, thrash her! Why have you stopped?” shouted voices in the crowd.And Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time on the spine of the luckless mare. She sank back on her haunches, but lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first on one side and then on the other, trying to move the cart. But the six whips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised again and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured blows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.	 … “She’ll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of her,” said an admiring spectator in the crowd.	  “Fetch an axe to her! Finish her off,” shouted a third.	  “I’ll show you! Stand off,” Mikolka screamed frantically; he threw down the shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. “Look out,” he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the poor mare. The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull, but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on the ground like a log.
 No doubt this image is effective. It brings to light the pointless cruelty that often forms part of human-nature, while foreshadowing Raskilnikov’s own thoughtless homicide. However, the sheer helplessness of the horse in this scene, which happens to occur towards the start of novel, can put the most perseverant reader off. It may be possible to highlight these same issues with less negativity, however, perhaps it is Dostoevsky’s intention to force the reader into an uncomfortable reflection.Crime and Punishment, being a classic, intends to provide some sort of insight into life. A more literal examination of the book would lead the reader to draw parallels with the Crime and Punishment in Western liberal democracies, USA being the best example of this. The United States accounts for 5% of the world population, yet 25% of the world’s prisoners, leading the world in gross prison population. Yet, every year, one out of five Americans are victims of crime, amongst the highest in the world. Dostoevsky’s insight in prisons role in criminalizing people, is relevant, and seems to be backed up by the statistics. However, it is the contrasting, dual traits of characters that provided the deepest insight for me. The realization that people are characters in transformation is not only interesting, but has practical application for any member of society. While it may help one to be empathetic towards others, it also encourages one to transform and surpass oneself. Possibly akin to Nietszche’s ‘Superman’ philosophy, which may account for his praise of Dostoevsky.This book is not very entertaining. Except for Luzhin, few moments offer comic relief. However, the heavy, toxic atmosphere forces the reader along a path of uncomfortable reflection. The reader is made to face unhappy truths about human nature, irrationality and cruelty. In addition, the reader sees the world he knows painted in the dull, depraved shades that color Raskilnikov’s mind. Seeing the world through this lens, along with the transforming characters that the reader is introduced to, encourages the reader to change his outlook on life. While one is not meant to adopt Raskilnikov’s negative view, one must just acknowledge that these views exist and are valid. Thus, the real value of this book lies in this uncomfortable reflection that might result in a change in perspective.While I can’t say I enjoyed this book, reading it was probably one of the most important things I did this year. While it was unable to permanantly mar my optimism about life, it has added a certain amount of caution to my thoughts and actions. Along with A Brave New World, this book led me to write my latest piece in the Hawks Eye Newspaper, easily the most pessimistic piece of writing I have ever written. In fact, this novel caused me to fling away my usual enthusiasm for school, and replace it with a listless attitude that was probably not very beneficial for my Grad year! While diction used ia rather simple, the complexity of the mainly gloomy situations, emotions and dialogues makes the novel surprisingly challenging to read. On the other hand, for the characterization alone, this book is a worthwile read. Nietschze’s praise may not have been that off the mark, after all."
"1876",1875,"Parth","The greatest study of psychology and tale of redemption ever conceived or penned. Dostoyevsky captures our imagination with the very Chapter and the novel never ceases to mystify. Undoubtedly, you watch as Rodion becomes a part of your very soul and you evidently seek redemption in your Sonia. Having said that, the redemption of Lebeziatnikoff is no less poignant. Porphyrius never gains his, quite happy for that. Though the redemption of Sonia is what tears your heart to pieces, even writing about it sends chills down my spine, so much provocation is in the event.

I'm so happy I pushed through the long rambling speeches the characters make in this book because in the heart of this book is a story that makes you think and think some more and I'm really just so impressed with this and will recommend it to anyone who asks.

"1885",1884,"Alexander Francis","I loved this book! I was kind of depressed at the time which didn't help but I thought it was fascinating. I don't want to ruin the book but the ending was amazing. The real punishment is psychological I believe. That is the worst of all possible punishments but the one that comes with all crimes. I want to talk with someone about the book, it's been a while for me and I was young but I want to see what ya'll have to say. "
"1886",1885,"Mary Gershon","This is probably one of my favourite books ever! Read it when I was about 15yo and it sure did open my mind up to the complexity of the human mind and all the possibilities in life. At 15 it wasn't the happiest book to read but I loved it and I still do read it sometimes. "
"1887",1886,"Kennedy Ifeh","The plot of Crime and Punishment is centered on the moral struggles and mental anguish of the protagonist, Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov was an impoverished former student in St. Pittsburg who dropped out of school due to financial reasons. He conceptualizes a plan to kill a pawn-broker, for the benefit of the impoverished in his immediate community. What kind of a man would kill for the benefit of mankind? What benefit of mankind?Raskolnikov goes ahead to murder the pawn-broker, Alyona Ivanovna, with an axe (an act the author described in exhaustive details). Raskolnikov kills Alyona Ivanovna, and soon realizes that he forgot to lock the door. Alyona Ivanovna’s half-sister, Lizaveta, who unfortunately stumbled into the scene of the crime, was also murdered by Raskolnikov.His plan is in-line with his own hypothesis (something he had proposed in a paper he published in a Journal), that certain people have the tendencies of becoming a Napolean, a man-God, by stepping beyond the moral and legal limits of man-made institutions. As such, murder and all kinds of social vices are permissible, only to the extent that these kinds of people see their actions as a means towards the uplifting humanity. Rskolnikov was driven by the ambitions to become a Napolean. This thesis is to be reflected through the 20th and 21st century, in characters like Hitler, the Soviets, religious fundamentalists etc.Raskolnikov in Razumikhin’s company visits Porfiry Petrovich. They discuss about Raskolnikov’s published work. In the scene, Dostoyevsky, speaking through Raskolnikov, lays bare the objective of the novel. He gives the reader the idea of the Napoleonic character he saw in human nature. It was a kind of prophetic hypothesis. My criticism of the novel is based on the fact that Dostoyevsky precisely analyzed and fore-told the defect of human nature. He predicted a hydra-headed monster and left mankind with his fate, in the middle of nowhere. As a conservative that he is, he offers no solution to this problem, a fundamental defect of Dostoyevsky’s ideas. Like Raskolnikov said, ‘its not my fault that this problem exist.’After the murder, Raskolnikov steals the items of the pawn-broker. He hides the stolen items under a rock. Thereafter, he falls into a deep feverish unconscious state and his conscience is deeply troubled over the crime. He had been mistaken in his thought that the act of murder would transform him into a Napolean. Instead of the boost of his ego, he got a charred conscience.In his state of delirium, Raskolnikov was cared for by Natasha, the housekeeper at his apartment; a doctor named Zossimov; and his best friend, Razumikhin.The story goes back and forth, and back and forth, in intense psychological drama. Raskolnikov is at times nasty, at others funny, and at others pitiful. He is tormented by his conscience. He behaves like a lunatic, arrogant, temperamental and self-delusional. He roams the streets of St. Pittsburg, drawing suspicions to himself. On one occasion, he goes to the house where he murdered the pawn-broker and asks to buy the place. On another occasion, he talks carelessly in a bar with Zametov, the police official, and almost confesses his crime. The story becomes the talk of the town and the police start to investigate the crime.In a related sub-plot, Raskolnikov receives a letter and money from his mother. In the letter, his mother asks for his consent for his sister, Dunya, to accept the marriage proposal of one Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin, a middle income earner in St. Petsburg. Raskolnikov resents the idea because he felt that his mother was selling his sister for money.In another sub-plot, Mamelydov, a town drunk, whom Raskolnikov had met in a bar in the period of conceptualizing his crime, is overriding by a horse, and dies suddenly. Here the deep altruistic (double) side of Raskolnikov begins to evolve. He gives the money he got from his mother to the family of Mamelydov to organize the funeral of the dead. He begins to develop emotions for Sonia, the daughter of Mamelydov, who had been driven into prostitution to support her family.Raskolnikov’s mother and Dunya visit St. Pittsburg, to see Raskolnikov and Luzhin. Raskolnikov’s disapproval of Dunya’s relationship with Luzhin becomes obvious. Raskolnikov makes his position very clear, that his sister should choose between him and Luzhin. Dunya chooses her brother, Raskolnikov. This coincides with the time that a police detective, Porfiry, begins to suspect Raskolnikov of the murder of the pawn broker.In another sub-plot, yet another character, Svidrigaïlov, is introduced. Dunya had worked as a governess for Svidrigailov’s family, but was forced out of the position. Svidrigailov was attracted to Dunya. He comes to St. Pittsburg to see Dunya. He reveals that his wife is dead and intends to pay Dunya a vast sum of money.The relationship between Raskolnikov and Sonya begins to develop at this point. Sonya happens to have some Christian values. Raskolnikov feels the urge to confess his crime to Dunya. He asks her to read him the story of Lazarus. Afterwards as their relationship develops, Raskolnikov confesses his crime to Sonya. By coincidence, Svidrigailov was taking up residence in a room next to Sonya’s. He overhears Raskolnikov’s confession. Svidrigailov begins to develop the tendencies to use the confession to blackmail Raskolnikov and his sister Dunya.Sonya urges Raskolnikov to confess his sins and kiss the ground. Porfiry also coincidentally confronts Raskolnikov with his suspicions and tries to prod him to confess, so as to get a lighter sentence. Svidrigailov attempts to seduce Dunya. She had a gun pointed at him. After two failed attempts at killing him, he lets her go. He is convinced that she doesn’t love him. The next day he shoots himself.Raskolnikov kissed the ground, as demanded by Sonya, then he goes to the police bureau to confess. He is sentenced to eight years in prison and then taken to Siberia. Sonya, as she had promised earlier, followed Raskolnikov to the prison. Dunya eventually marries Razumikhin. Raskolnikov’s mother fell ill and died. After some time in prison, and with Sonya as his companion, Raskolnikov begins to get redemptions.While I maintain that it poverty and suffering brings out the sanctity of the human soul, suffering cannot be considered as a condition to redemption. Here lies my criticism of Dostoyevsky. Redemption, rebirth and spiritual regeneration are a consequence of the human will. God leaves us to the freedom of our choices. Light and darkness cannot meet. God cannot impose suffering on us, because he wants us to be saved."

"1890",1889,"Jgnat","Painful insight in to human nature. A transforming story. "
"1891",1890,"fo jammi","Utterly fantastic. Some scenes from this novel will stay with you forever. A riveting exploration of both the human mind and Russian society in St. Petersburg 150 years ago. Dostoevsky peels your mind like a grape and takes you on a soul-battering trip to transcendence. The characters are sometimes almost hyper-real. I think I can feel Sdrigailov's breath on my face during his speaking passages, and it's a harrowing experience. Three cautions: the Russian penchant for multiple names used interchangeably may be confusing - two - I've heard that the quality of translations varies considerably - and finally - the physical travails of the characters may leave you vicariously exhausted."
"1892",1891,"Nathan","This book was amazing and had such a deep and profound theme. There is so much symbolism in this book, and whoever translated it from the Russian was a genius, along with Fyodor Dostoevsky, probably the best or one of the best Russian authors of all time."

"1894",1893,"Камен","Книгата, която проникна най-дълбоко в душата ми. Епохален роман!The book, which penetrated most deeply into my soul. Epochal novel!"
"1895",1894,"Ryan","Through a diverse cast of characters, dostoevsky asks us to consider the relationship between morality and legality. what is the definition of a 'crime?' why is it so often determined retroactively whether an action was justified or not? sometimes i wondered as a kid how the exact same action (say, jumping on the couch cushions) could be punished so differently simply by the difference in the outcome (did i break something or not). the penalty for jumping on the couch should be a fixed quantity, regardless of the near-random consequences of the action. perhaps, more than results of the action, we should base our punishment on the intentions of perpetrator? take drunk driving for example. if you are pulled over for driving drunk, the penalty is loss of license and a litany of other annoyances designed to teach you a lesson. if, however, your exact same transgression results in the loss of an innocent life (a pedestrian), your penalty for drunk driving will be prison. you did the same thing, had the same intentions, only the outcome was different.another great question dostoevsky poses is whether transgression of the law or of morality are permissible in the pursuit of a higher goal. raskolnikov believes that certain people were endowed with a greater intellect, a greater ""will to power"" to borrow a phrase, and are thus above the law when rising to their great potential. the people who move society forward are all criminals at heart, destroyers of the status quo. often their actions result in bloodshed, but all is forgiven when they achieve their aims. if they do not, however, achieve their aims, they are held accountable for the very same actions which would otherwise have been forgotten or even applauded.for all the lessons in this novel, it's still a wonderful story. the 19th century dialogue translated from russian is tiresome and ridiculous, but you can get used to it."
"1896",1895,"Azadeh","It is a great piece of literature. The way that the writer developes the characters is very special. There is detective in this book that the last dialogue between him and the protagonist really surprised me. I admit that I liked it!And it is a journey to human mind, a difficult one. Rascolnikov can be any of us...A really different look at the concept of love. I'm not really sure if I liked the way the character of women was created in this story.In the last chapter, the journey seems to be finished. It seems that we are left behind and the protagonist is going on. The author says that a new journey is about to begin...And last but not least is that once was not enough!"

"
"1898",1897,"Alysson","On the surface it is an easy book to read; the modern writing translated by Pevar and Volokhonsky is done beautifully. But since the book lends itself to SO MANY themes and elements, keeping up with Dostoevsky's symbolism and societal commentary is a rewarding but tiring task. I was mesmerized at all the connections... and my boyfriend probably got annoyed of my random expressions of ""OH!! THAT'S LIKE [insert sneakily related incident/imagery here]! AWESOME! :D""Needless to say, I LOVED this book. It really made me reconsider my own judgments of why people do what they do. Part of the fun of reading this was following Raskolnikov's thoughts. Dostoevsky's portrayal of Raskolnikov's suffering during his mental transition-from believing he is above all, to an increasingly paranoid and insecure mortal-was flawlessly illustrated. What struck me the most was that Dostoevsky chose to create Sonya's character as the book's moral center. She's a prostitute but her faith permeates through her every action, and she is the reason Raskolnikov does what he does at the end of the novel.I strongly encourage everyone to at some point read this. The greats learned that humility is a weapon. And as Raskolnikov demonstrates, sometimes you have to fight your mind and try to find the present."
"1899",1898,"Stephen Mander","Dostoyevsky's finest venture - dark, bleak, and impossible to ignore."
"1900",1899,"Jim Fonseca","What can I add to 7000+ reviews (at the time I write)? I think this book is fascinating because of all the topic it covers. Like the OJ trial, it is about many important interconnected things and those things remain important today, even though this book was originally published in 1865.Sure, it has a lot about crime and punishment. But also insanity and temporary insanity, the latter a legal plea that could be entered in Russia of the mid-1800's. It's about guilt and conscience, long before Freud. In fact, this book was written at a time when psychological theories were coming into vogue. It's about false confessions. It's about poverty and social class and people who rise above their class and people who fall from the class they were born into. It's about the wild dreams and the follies of youth.There is also mention of many social theories that were in vogue at that time, so, for example, if you want to, you can click on Wikipedia to find out about ""Fourier's system"" and his phalansteres. There is attempted rape, blackmail, child labor, child prostitution, child marriage and child molestation. There is discussion of marrying for money. There are ethnic tensions between Russians and the Germans of St. Petersburg. Should you give to charity or should you give to change the conditions that caused the poverty? Like me, you may have thought that was a modern idea, but here it is, laid out in 1865. There's a lot about alcoholism. Stir in a cat-and-mouse detective and a bit of Christian redemption. No wonder this is a classic. "
"1901",1900,"Marlowe","I just reread this for the first time since 1996. I loved it the first time but found it even more fulfilling, humorous, intoxicating, and brilliant this time. Definitely check out this translation. "
"1902",1901,"Dallin","Intense, complex,  Crime and Punishment is a fantastic novel, even though it can be tangential and convoluted at times. Dostoevsky's work explores how a murderer deals with his crime. One of the best summations of it is that Crime and Punishment is not like typical detective novels, where you know the crime and want to find the culprit, but in this book, you know the culprit and you want to find out if he committed any crime. While the book could probably be even more powerful if it was more condensed, the ending is great and the philosophy is really intriguing."
"1903",1902,"Enmanuel","A thrilling story that will hook you up from the beginning"
"1904",1903,"hcelvis","Raskolnikow, ein verarmter Student im St. Petersburg des 19. Jahrhunderts, sieht seine einzige Chance, an seiner Karriere weiter zu arbeiten, im Verbrechen. Ohne Geld kein Studium und da er der Welt sein Genie nicht verschliessen will, ist es seine Pflicht, irgendwie Geld aufzutreiben, um so sein Studium fortsetzen zu können. Was ist schon eine alte unbeliebte fiese Pfandleiherin im Vergleich zu dem, was er der Welt bieten könnte, hätte er nur das Geld für seine Ausbildung. So reift in ihm ein folgenschwerer Entschluß.Klassische Weltliteratur, das klingt immer nach schwierig, anstrengend, kaum zu bewältigen, nach Arbeit und erinnert an düstere Schulzeiten in denen Literatur durch Zwang zu Folter verkam.Nichtsdestotrotz habe ich mir einmal vorgenommen, mich an möglichst vielen Klassikern bzw. deren Autoren wenigstens einmal zu versuchen, so dass ich sie danach guten Gewissens in die Ecke pfeffern und alles weitere ignorieren kann, weil der gute Wille ja da war ... oder eben auch nicht, nämlich mich begeistern zu lassen, zu verstehen, was großartig ist und Spaß daran zu finden.So hab ich mich dann auch an Dostojewskis Verbrechen und Strafe gemacht, mit einer Erwartung, die an die Situation am Fuße eines zu bezwingenden Berges erinnert. Man will es packen, man rechnet aber nicht mit viel Freude daran, aber andere haben es ja auch geschafft. Und siehe da: So schwer war der Aufstieg gar nicht. Verbrechen und Strafe hat viel von einem Krimi, spannende Momente, die Sprache ist dank der gelungen Übersetzung Swetlana Geiers gar nicht so schwierig, manch etwas langatmige Stelle gibt es zwar, aber da ist man schnell drüber weg. Und die etwas schwülstigen Reden und Dialoge passen zu der Zeit und lassen den Umgang der Menschen untereinander, die im 19. Jahrhundert in St. Petersburg lebten oder teils eher vegetierten, erleben.So gehört Dostojewski nach der Lektüre von Verbrechen und Strafe nicht zu den Autoren, die ich ignorieren werde. Anspruchsvolle Literatur, die sich aber gut lesen lässt, eine spannende Handlung, eine philosophische Abhandlung darüber, ob Grenzen überschritten werden dürfen, wer sich über Regeln hinwegsetzen darf und gleichzeitig ein Krimi, der so manchem modernen Krimi in nichts nachsteht.Überraschung gelungen."

"1906",1905,"Aruna","Good Books are like Pythons. They will take some time to get hold of you and then they will crush you into pieces before taking you down towards their climatic thought and what comes out of this experience is a different you altogether and then there are great books.

Made me jump in joy literally. Bless Russian Literature for what it has given us. "
"1907",1906,"Faller Clementine","This is just such a multi-layered novel that I know it will take multiple readings of this for me to be able wrap my head around all the depth that is present in this book. All I can say is Crime and Punishment is complex and nuanced, with Dostoevsky painting a glass-clear portrait of the conditions present during mid-1800s Petersburg in Russia, particularly those of the severely destitute. There were a few things here and there that annoyed me a little. Raskolnikov in particular, with all his agonizing and fainting and nerves miffed me. Even so, I could understand his actions (given the situation he was in), and it was quite easy for me to sympathize with someone who much of the outside world would only see as a homicidal maniac. This is obviously not an easy task, and Dostoevsky is not only able to do it, but carry it out with grace and gravitas. Porfiry's little ""hehes"" and chuckles aggravated me too, but these are only simple things. They could not possibly overshadow how thought-provoking and discerning this story is.Raskolnikov's transition is a long one, fraught with tension, anguish, and death. In the end, you can not help but feel for Rodion Romanovitch, and all those who surround him."
"1908",1907,"Simona Bartolotta","""Qui si tratta di una storia fantastica e cupa, roba attuale, una storia dei nostri tempi, nei quali il cuore umano si è intorbidato, nei quali si dice che ""il sangue rinfresca""; nei quali si predica che tutta la vita consiste nelle comodità. Qui si tratta di sogni libreschi; di un cuore esasperato dalle teorie; qui si vede la decisione nel compiere il primo passo, ma una decisione tutta particolare...""Scrivere questa recensione è per me un atto di coraggio. Perché sono incredibilmente spaventata all'idea di sparare baggianate su questo capolavoro. Le mie dita tremano battendo i tasti, un po' per l'emozione (ho appena appena letto l'ultima pagina) un po' per l'irritazione. Irritazione, sì, perché so già che non riuscirò a dire tutto ciò che adesso ho intenzione di dire, so già che mi perderò a metà strada, so già che le parole mi condurranno dove vorranno loro. Non riuscirò mai a capire da dove traggono questa loro furbizia.Si capisce che sto divagando perché non ho la più pallida idea di come iniziare? Mi sento un po' come chi ride per non piangere. Sapete quella risata isterica e forzata? Io sto scrivendo con quello spirito. E sì che da piangere ce n'è stato. Ma io non l'ho fatto.Anzi. Non ho versato una lacrima, diciamo così, perché il mio cuore dalla metà del romanzo in poi non ha fatto altro che gridare e disperarsi e gemere. E' stato uno strazio, anche se dolcissimo. Ecco, ancora una volta le parole hanno trovato da sé la loro strada e mi hanno portata dove non immaginavo di arrivare. Hanno trovato per me la descrizione perfetta di ciò che Delitto e castigo ha rappresentato per me: uno strazio dolcissimo.E qui dovrei profondermi in ringraziamento per quel geniaccio di Dostoevskij, ma dirò solo che mi sarei sentita indegna persino di sfiorare la punta della sua penna. Avessi anche solo un quarto della sua bravura, del suo stile, della sua potenza narrativa. Una potenza che non sta tutta nell'arte di comporre frasi, ma che trova continuazione nella capacità straordinaria che quest'uomo aveva di capire. (Inizialmente la mia intenzione era quella di dotare la frase precedente di complemento oggetto; capire cosa? Ma poi mi sono resa conto che Dostoevskij non capiva solo il 'qualcosa', il particolare, lui capiva tutto nel suo insieme. Se questo insieme fosse l'uomo, fosse la disperazione, fosse il tormento, fosse il terrore, non sono capace di stabilirlo. E che io possa essere dannata se riesco a comprendere come faceva a riportare così bene tutto questo nero su bianco.)Una altro elemento che mi lascia sempre spiazzata quando ho a che fare con autori di questo tenore, è la loro sfuggevolezza. La loro chiarezza nell'esporre le loro idee o quelle dei personaggi, e poi la tua frustrazione nell'accorgerti che non riesci ad afferrare completamente ciò che volevano comunicarti. E' una sensazione strana, ma alla quale il lettore riesce miracolosamente a sopravvivere, incolume e felice. Se volete un consiglio, cercate questo nei romanzi che leggete: le verità nascoste che avrete tempo di scoprire a poco a poco. Credo che sviscerare completamente certi libri alla prima lettura sia una violenza inutile; è bello invece ""impadronirsene"" col tempo, lasciando che ciò che abbiamo imparato sedimenti dentro di noi.Ma mi accorgo che delle normali cose che un normale lettore vorrebbe e dovrebbe leggere in una normale recensione ho parlato poco e niente. Bene, carissimi, cosa volete che vi dica? Dell'autore vi ho detto già qualcosina, forse della storia? Ci sarebbe troppo da raccontare, e perciò dovrete accontentarvi del troppo poco che vi regalerò, e che sono queste citazioni, dal momento che le mie parole sono oramai prosciugate:«Allora, Sonja, finalmente capii», proseguì Raskol'nikov in tono esaltato, «che il potere spetta solo a chi osa chinarsi per raccoglierlo. C'è una sola cosa da fare: osare!»«Mammima, qualunque cosa accada, qualunque cosa sentiate dire di me, qualunque cosa vi dicano, mi amerete sempre come adesso?» domandò all'improvviso Raskol'nikov, e queste parole gli proruppero da dentro come se non le avesse neppure pensate e soppesate prima.«Sono un individuo abietto, Dunja.»«Un individuo abietto, che però accetta di andare a soffrire! Perché ci andrai, non è vero?»«Sì, ci andrò. E subito. Proprio per evitare questa vergogna, volevo affogarmi, Dunja. Ma mentre già mi sporgevo verso l'acqua, ho pensato che se finora mi sono creduto un uomo forte, adesso non devo aver paura della vergogna», disse Raskol'nikov, anticipando i tempi. «E' forse orgoglio, questo, Dunja?»«Sì, Rodja, è orgoglio.»"

"1910",1909,"Regina","This is my favorite fiction book of all time... which, is a bit weird, but there you go. I love that Raskolnikov comes from the word that means schism and is talking about the two sides of him that are at odds with each other (spirit vs. flesh, anyone?). Except for the whole murder thing, I feel like this! Obviously it's Russian literature which can be difficult to get through, but well worth a read (and then re-read 10 years later, if you're like me, and wanted to make sure it was still your favorite book). =) Not a nightly page turner like my YA books, though. Heh heh."

"1915",1914,"Daniel Pecheur","One of the greatest novels I've ever read. A fascinating exploration into the depths of the human psychology pitted into a suspenseful crime drama filled with dynamic and complex characters intersecting in the squalid underclass realm of St. Petersburg that festers with poverty, destitution and depravity. Raskolnikov is one of the most ingeniously profound characters of literature and his inner turmoil in the aftermath of his heinous crime that culminates in one of the most masterfully wrought and penetrating tales of redemption. Is the novel free of any errors? No. Sure it has imperfections, like any human creation. The characters function most importantly as symbols, the dialogue lacks some variety from character to character and the very end sort of slows down a bit and loses the suspense. However, this is certainly a masterpiece like no other. There are few other novels that have left me with so much to reflect on or contemplate. It's a brilliant exposee of human nature in its multi-faceted string of contradictions and flaws. It's rich with motifs and symbols, it's powerful with emotional intensity. The narrative style is incredibly unique, permitting the reader an intimate scrutiny of the character's psychologies, particularly Raskolnikov who constantly wavers and alternates between different extremes. Surely no list of the world's greatest literature is complete without Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment."

Don't be intimidated by the monstrous length of this book because once Dostoyevsky has your attention by the throat, you'll end up finishing it in a matter of days. Marmeladov, the rambling drunkard, was my favourite character. Immensely enjoyable, immersing, darkly funny and has earned its place in my favourite books. Not as dreary as I thought it'd be. A monumentally important book, and surprisingly entertaining. I think I need a lie down. "
"1920",1919,"Serena","This book ranks with George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss as my favorite classic of all time.Both Crime and Mill have such deep and complex psychological analyses---they show that the authors really UNDERSTOOD the characters, not just observed them.I would say that Crime has even more psychology than Mill, which makes the former greater; yet Mill is about emotions I can relate to and understand more easily, which makes it more touching.Also, both books go SO deep in their analysis of what will happen if an intellectual idea is taken too far. I love this philosophical point!In such great amounts of psychological penetration into Rodya Raskolnikov and Maggie Tulliver, their characters become so developed. I have never seen such Hyper-Developed characters like these before! Svidrigailov likewise was astonishingly well developed.*spoiler*The situation at Sonia's father and stepmother's was so distressingly sad. That a consumptive, blood-coughing mother had to work hard and care for kids in a flat she's about to be kicked out of and that her husband had just died is just......too overwhelming...I also loved and was surprised, that Crime had a happy ending! It was so hopeful, so inspiring for my own life. If Rodya can regenerate and start a new life, then we, in our much better positions, can definitely do so too!"
"1921",1920,"Janet Eo","Of all the novels that I have read in school thus far, Crime and Punishment has had the most impact on me. Throughout the entire novel, Dostoyevsky drew me into the story with Raskolnikov's psychological struggle - the realism of Raskolnikov's mental battle with ethics, logic, love, religion, and guilt drew me in like a magnet and carried me from cover to cover.If I am grateful to AP Literature for just one thing, it is for the opportunity to read Crime and Punishment from beginning to end.

Be it any kind of a reader you may be, this novel reflects the self in a way or another. Raskolnikov's crime might be considered heinous, but we all have committed crimes of some sorts, of varying degrees. It's not the Crime itself that tortures us, it's living with it that torments us. The only way out of this everlasting suffering is Punishment. And to have that we have, first, to confess to our crimes and face them and most importantly accept them instead of legitimizing them. "
"1926",1925,"Sebastian Uribe","Lo triste de acabar Crimen y Castigo es el de reconocer que nunca más se podrá decir ""Acabo de leer Crimen y Castigo"" por primera vez. Una obra maestra de todos los tiempo, un mosaico de la tragedia humana, la miseria y extremos a los que se puede llegar por un fanatismo de la razón. Sólo nos salvará la conciencia es lo que único que puede concluirse con certeza. Un libro que hace pensar más allá de su propia historia"
"1927",1926,"Melissa Luna","I learned how to endure unlikeable characters for the big payoff. Dostoevsky is deep. Passionate, honest, raw. A very visceral experience. I didn't ""get it"" until at least half way through though so have patience."
"1928",1927,"Evelyn Puerto","For years I've heard about Crime and Punishment and how it is one of the most exquisite and powerful novels of all time. Hearing such accolades about a book makes me nervous about reading it, as they conjur up images of weighty, serious prose that reads more like a textbook than I novel.Crime and Punishment is nothing like a textbook. Instead, it is a murder mystery told from the point of view of the murderer. The mystery is whether he will get caught or turn himself in, whether he repents or destroys himself. Some of the passages that depict the protagonis's decent into madness are hard to read. Others, such as the scene where the prostitute and the murderer read from the Bible are unforgettable. There is so much depth in Crime and Punishment that a close reading with add to the rewards of reading this book."
"1929",1928,"Gregory Mcdonald","A classic for all times. Some say Freud read this book and it influenced his development of the theory of the unconscious.

"1934",1933,"Robia","By far, my favorite book of all-time!"
"1935",1934,"B.B. Gallagher","Crime and Punishment is my favorite novel probably ever. It tackles something that is always close to each and every person's life - guilt. Over and over again you think he will confess his sins, but no. He keeps it close to the chest where it mutates him. It eats away at him, morphing him into something worse than a murderer. Anyone should enjoy this incredibly in depth examination of humanity. This novel is a classic for a reason, it shows how the soul is morphable. It changes as it grows darker and lighter. Of course Dostoyevsky has a slew of character that are difficult to remember. He writes a gripping novel that is incredibly personal to each and every one of us. I recommend this for anyone. I also recommend that you read it on the Kindle Paper White. This Russian Lit classic has so many characters, each with multiple names, the X-ray functionality on the Paper White will come in handy on this one. "

"1940",1939,"Zenit Saphyr","!!!Este livro não devia ter sido lido, porque há palavras para as quais não devemos sequer olhar se não corremos o risco de acabar os nossos dias a gritar frases incoerentes pelas ruas cheias de gente. Não sei como posso ter estado 55 anos sem conhecer o meu irmão Raskolnikov...que livro brilhante, com todas as palavras no lugar...O crime do protagonista é uma metáfora para todas as dores e traumas que não podem ser partilhados e que temos de sofrer em silêncio. Poucos descrevem esse tormento como o Dostoyevski!Este escrito contém revelações cruciais dos capítulos finais de Crime e Castigo de Fiódor Dostoyevski. À atenção dos hipotéticos leitores.Estava numa Departamento das Finanças, lendo um dos capítulos finais de Crime e Castigo à espera da minha vez de ser atendido, quando me deparei com uma passagem pungente do brilhante romance do escritor russo, em que ele dedicava a sua atenção à misteriosa personagem Svidrigailóv. O pretendente da irmã de Raskolnikóv, completamente perdido de amores por ela, anda perdido pelas ruas de S. Petersburgo e vai parar a um hotel onde não consegue dormir porque houve uma criança a chorar por um qualquer motivo absurdo. Então, sai e suicida-se em frente a um agente da lei. Já há muito que eu tinha percebido que a personagem se ia matar, mas o meu estado emocional e a forma como está escrito levaram a que eu me desfizessem em lágrimas à frente de toda a gente que por ali cirandava e eu não pude fazer nada para as evitar, pelo que as deixei escorrer violentamente pelo meu rosto sem levantar os olhos do livro. Comecei a soluçar de forma incontrolável enquanto a minha alma dilacerada gritava ""Svidrigáilov, Svidrigailóv, SVIDRIGÁILOV! Os homens maus também se matam! os homens maus também se matam e morrem sofrendo de amores e dores insondáveis!"". Svidirgáilov é uma personagem construída de forma meticulosa e ao qual não é dado muito tempo, até para manter a aura de estranheza que a torna tão interessante, pois é pelo facto de nós nunca entendermos bem o que Svidrigáilov quer, quais são as suas intenções, que ele se nos afigura tão memorável. E também pelo seu nome, que é lindíssimo, como Raskolnikóv, como Pulkhéria Aleksandrovna, como Razumíkhin. Continuei agitado durante alguns segundos, com as mãos em frente aos olhos e a respiração ofegante, mas depois voltei a concentrar-me na parte final do capítulo e nas últimas palavras do estranho personagem, sem ter coragem de levantar os olhos das linhas e encarar as pessoas que me rodeavam e que certamente teriam reparado no meu pranto. Enquanto enxugava os olhos repreendi-me interiormente por ter dito que ele era um homem mau. ""Os homens são todos mau""s pensei para mim e reflecti sobre essa frase. ""Sim, os homens são todos maus e as mulheres também"". As palavras seguintes já as murmurei audivelmente: ""Sim, as mulheres também"" e soltei uma estrondosa gargalhada, tirando finalmente os olhos do livro. Todas as pessoas que ali estavam olhavam para mim como se eu fosse um louco. Soltei uma nova gargalhada e gritei ""SIM, AS MULHERES TAMBÉM AHAHAH"". Levantei-me e precipitei-me para a saída. Posso tratar deste problema noutro dia."

"1944",1943,"Gary","There's really no reason to spend a lot of time offering a ""review"" of Crime and Punishment. It's place in the canon of Western Civilization literature is unquestioned. I'll only say that it's an easy, fun read that is truly timeless. Now, in terms of this particular translation. I picked up my copy of Crime and Punishment at the local Half Priced Books for a whopping $.30. The translation was done by Brit, Michael Scammell and the back cover touts the edition as ""the first translation into the American vernacular."" Very well, I thought. But as I got deeper into the novel I noticed that Scammell's knowledge of the American vernacular was severely lacking. Using such British phrases as ""cheeky monkey"" and ""bob's your uncle"" it was clear that Scammell knew little of the way Americans really speak. After about a 100 pages I decided to do a little experiment. I downloaded the Constance Garnett translation to my kindle and started rotating between versions, every other chapter. It became quite clear that all Scammell had managed to do was tweak Garnett's edition. (e.g. swapping out the word ""nonsense"" with ""baloney"") otherwise things were exactly the same. Still, Scammell's version was worth the 30 cents I paid, after all, it did prod me towards this classic piece of literature. "
"1945",1944,"Branka Katičić","A masterpiece! Dostoyevsky deserved the title of the greatest psychologist in the history of literature. One of the best novels I've read. It's so intense and real, couldn't get my hands off the book. "
"1946",1945,"Cliff","I am more of a human being for having read this novel. I hope it lasts. This and Anna Karenina are almost tied for the best and most elevating novels I've ever read. Thank you Dostoevsky for suffering and doing something with that suffering. "
"1947",1946,"Claudia Blanco","If I had to choose only one book to take with me to an island, that would be Crime and Punishment.

"1948",1947,"Ayleen Julio","Tuvo que pasar mucho (pero mucho) tiempo para que me decidiera retomar y terminar este libro, tan extenso y lleno de matices que a veces desorienta de su argumento central; pero ya sabemos que leer a los rusos supone una tarea a veces titánica no sólo por la extensión, sino por la complejidad de su temática. Algo que amé profundamente en este libro es el manejo de los estadios mentales de Raskolnikov tras el crimen, del mismo modo que sus móviles. Lo demás -caracterización de los personajes y otros conflictos- está muy bien logrado, aunque debo confesar que por momento sentía que habían cosas de más. No obstante, es un texto que sorprende porque muchos conflictos no se resuelven de la forma que una espera y por el manejo de referencias externas a la novela. Un clásico absolutamente recomendado. "
"1949",1948,"Daniela Benjumea","A true timeless classic from a genius! Crime and punishment is one of those books you continue to ponder even when you've long finished reading it.

Requires focus and concentration but you will be rewarded. 4.8 because an author of his caliber shall never use the word indescribable which he used twice."

It is wonderfully and captivatingly written, if not a little too much so. A true classic!"
"1952",1951,"Sydney Glover","One of my favorite books that I read in high school English. The plot is absolutely insane and surprisingly relatable.

"1958",1957,"matt","I tried to read this in highschool in one of the Constance Garnett translations and good goddamn was it horrible! Tepid, murky, ashy, turgid.Then I was assigned this for a class in college and it blew me away. Pevear/ Volokhonsky brought out the fire and the passion and the direness of the story in a way that pinned my ears back.I reread it a couple of years ago (something I never do, sadly enough) to see if the burning lights were still shining and....yup. They were still kickin'.This has to be read by everybody who can read. I turned on a couple of friends to it who had never been exposed to Dostoevsky's world before and they, too, were swept away.Long hours spent roiling with the visions of St. Petersberg with Raskolnikov et al. Absolutely worth it, no question at all. This book has all the power and authority of a knife thrown firmly and fiercely into a wall. Would that all books were that sheerly sublime!"

"1960",1959,"Jr Bacdayan","I do not know how to begin, I am utterly troubled. What to do? What to say? In my opinion, to write a review of Dostoyevsky's great masterpiece is a very hard undertaking. To write a decent one, even harder. A week ago, if you asked me what my favorite novel was, I'd greatly struggle with it. I might consider Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Nabokov's Lolita, or probably even Heller's Catch 22. I might give varying answers. It would probably depend on my mood, or the current focus of my stream of thoughts. But, alas! Now, now I have found it! A book, unquestionable enough to be the greatest novel and work of fiction that I have read. As I say this, please bear in mind that I have humbly read very few of the novels I intend to read. Let us say that I'm still a novice of the classical greats. Call me a classical dunce, if you must. I have scarcely pierced through the surface of the greatest literary works. Scarcely. So forgive me, if you think that I overpraise this. Bear with me. Deal with me as a wise and knowing adult would deal with an inquisitive child. What I ask for, is your indulgence, if you can give it to me.Crime & Punishment. Two words. Cause & effect. Low & High. Evil & Justice. Two words that are intertwined, knitted cheek by jowl, and always associated with the other. Two words that are close yet far as possible. The title's two words is reflective of Dostoyevsky's great masterpiece itself. Of course, it certainly is about the psychology of a crime and the punishment it measures. But more than that, the novel features exceedingly contrasting views. These views, contrasting and even paradoxical, can sincerely confuse a man. But, these seemingly contrasting views when scrutinized is really just the product of a struggle inside a man's very being. A man's final struggle of whether to finally detach himself from society, from life, from his humanity, or to finally succumb to it. These struggles, or contradictory ideas can be noted several times in the book. We have Raskolnikov's Napoleonic belief that he is of the elite, and should step over obstacles without being affected even if blood is involved, as was hinted in his article. Then, later on he would admit to Sonya that he was not of the elite since he was terribly affected. But again, when he was in prison he would declare that he was not there because he was guilty of anything but rather because he was weak and confessed. Also, we have his being generous and charitable. He would give Marmaladov's widow, Katarina Ivanovna, all the remaining 25 rubles his mother sent him. Then there was his helping of his schoolmate and the crippled father, and the saving of two children in the fire. Here was a man acting as a savior to strangers yet could not even bear to look and much less talk with his mother and sister. Here was a man who believed that anything could be sacrificed for the success of his career, who killed two women yet refused that her sister be wed to a rich man for his sake. Here was a man who regarded religion as nonsense yet read the gospel and asked people to pray for him. Here was a man who didn't care if he died, didn't eat, didn't care about his illness, yet refused to commit suicide. Here was a man suffering. A man, who because of his crime, suffered his punishment of madness, of guilt, of never ending anxiety and anxiousness. I fancy that Dostoyevsky reiterates that this punishment that goes on through a criminal's mind is far more potent than the punishment of being contained in four walls. As he pointed out in the epilogue, that in prison, the convicts valued life much more. While in this state of madness, of insane ecstasy. A man would undergo extreme suffering and lose his mind and matter. In the words of Sonya, ""Oh, what suffering! What suffering!""“The man who has a conscience suffers whilst acknowledging his sin. That is his punishment.” This struggle inside Raskolnikov, is enhanced by his intellect. He cannot help but disdain what is going on inside him. His reason rejects his will. If anything, the more intellectual you are, the more you are prone to detach from your surroundings. You reason that feelings and relations are merely nonsensical. You think of dialectics instead of breathing fresh air. “Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.” As I give my conclusion, let me also give some remarks about my feelings towards the end of the book. It is hard not to root for a happy ending. I was glad that Rasumikhin and Dunya had gotten theirs. And after such pain and suffering, I have forgiven Raskolnikov and want for him peace of mind too. His final realization that he indeed had love for Sonya brought me intense joy. I do not know why. Maybe it was empathy, if anyone deserved happiness it was Sonya. Sonya whose happiness was only through Raskolnikov. Here was a Murderer and a Harlot. Two shameful transgressors who believed that their transgressions were justified. One out of vanity, the other out of charity. One who is vile and contemptuous, the other loving and loyal. Bound together by some irreversible force of nature. Intertwined. Like the words Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov and Sonya are two people who are far different but are bound together. They are allegories of the words themselves. Raskolnikov stands for Crime. He is a murderer who is unrepentant, he is contemptuous, menacing, vain, and indifferent. A man who believes he is above the law. All for self-gain. Sonya stands for Punishment. She is true, loving, loyal, charitable, a woman who deserved richly but lived poorly. A call for justice. Raskolinkov and Sonya, two utterly different people that are connected by suffering. Raskolnikov is crime, he cannot atone himself no matter what he does. Sonya is the atoning punishment. Only through Punishment, can Crime be atoned. Only through Sonya, can Raskolnikov atone himself. This enduring masterpiece is a beauty to behold. A complex, broad, and psychological mastery of not only crime and punishment but also of life, death, sacrifice, society, intellect, love, and ultimately renewal and hope. As I end this review, let me leave you with this excerpts. ""Go now, this minute, stand in the crossroads, bow down, first kiss the earth you've defiled, then bow down to the whole world, on all four sides, then say aloud to everyone: 'I have killed!' """"Accept suffering and redeem yourself by it, that's what you must do.""""He went on down the stairs and came out in the courtyard. There in the courtyard, not far from the entrance, stood Sonya, pale, numb all over, and she gave him a wild, wild look. He stopped before her. Something painted and tormented, something desperate, showed in her face. She clasped her hands. A hideous, lost smile forced itself in his lips. He stood a while, grinned, and turned back upstairs to the office.""""But all at once, in the same moment, she understood everything. Infinite happiness lit up in her eyes; she understood, and for her there was no longer any doubt that he loved her, lover her infinitely, and at last the moment had come... """
"1961",1960,"Noah Gittell","I have been reading at a furious pace for the last two years, as if I am racing someone, and I finally know what has inspired it. I got married two years ago, moved to the suburbs, and sometimes I feel as if the only major life event left for me is my own death. When I had that epiphany, I started reading. My voracious appetite for literature was an act of pure fear - fear that I would die before I had read what I wanted to read, and fear that my life could not be lived to its fullest unless I had accrued the knowledge that I knew lay in the great works of fiction.I was thinking these thoughts as I read ""Crime and Punishment,"" a book that inspires introspection by raising the big questions without providing any on the answers. Raskolnikov, our anti-hero, is a young man who is, let's say, troubled and hatches a scheme to kill and rob an old woman. His motive is simple - he needs the money - but as soon as the deed is done, he begins to cloud his motive with philosophy, in telling himself that there is an entire class of special people to whom the normal rules of morality do not apply. He fancies himself one of these people, but the ensuing narrative proves him wrong.A great, thought-provoking read. It is surprisingly accessible, and its themes are not only relevant but maybe even urgent."
"1962",1961,"Robert Core","Russian politicians may be ham fisted and tone deaf, but their top writers pursue psychological drama to its fullest. The crime is committed early and the rest of the book is dedicated to the detective ""wearing down"" the perp who's not in custody. Sound boring - not on your life!"

"1964",1963,"Eric Schaible","This is Dostoevsky's best. Dostoevsky, more than any other writer, was able to blend thrilling fiction with The Big Questions (is there a God? Is any man above morality?) This is a book that changes lives, and makes one see the world differently afterwards. The Pevear and Volokhonsky translation reads pretty well, and seems smoother and more modern than the Garnett translation. Still, for loftiness, I give the slight edge to Garnett."
"1965",1964,"Mark Flowers","The first major Russian novel I read, and it remains one of my favorite books of all time. This may reveal a bit too much about myself (or maybe it says more about how good Dostoyevsky is), but I identified intensely with Raskolnikov, from his poseur stance as an intellectual, to his belief in his inherent superiority because of that intellect, to his overwhelming guilt at his misdeeds. Very powerful stuff."

"1969",1968," Danielle The Book Huntress (Self-Proclaimed Book Ninja)","With such beginning marred by a horrifying act of violence, this book could have easily been a depressing tragedy. But it is a book about redemption, forgiveness, and hope. I feel that this book gives the message that a person can always choose to turn their life around. They hold their fate in their hands by the choice to do the right thing. I started reading this book, not very happy that it was required reading. Before I knew it, I was eager to turn each page to see this man's journey from the pit of despair to a place where he could hope and could believe. This book had a very deep, profound effect on me when I read it."
"1970",1969,"Harold","Wow! Heavy! as we used to say in 60s and 70s. Psychological thriller all the way.Raskolnikov is tortured and blabs his thoughts to too many people.

"1974",1973,"Kate Brennan","This would have gotten 5 stars for a slightly different ending. There's something about salvation that I find needs to be contextually situated properly. Didn't care for the particular salvation at the end of this novel, but loved the novel anyway."
"1975",1974,"Aya Abdeen","انهيتها في صيف 2005 بمساعدة والدتي لانها كانت تدرسها في هذا العالم قبل ان ستبدلها برواية Animals Farm ومن وجهة نظري المتواضعة ان كلاهما من رواشع الادب العالمياعشق هاتين الروايتين فهما اول ما قرات بالانجليزية :) "
"1976",1975,"Brandon Rhoads","I have arrived late to the Dostoevsky game, but Crime & Punishment secured my fanhood. Read Brothers Karamazov in the Spring, and was surprised at how engaging such a notoriously dense work could be. C & P reads much simpler in its form, but is no less entertaining than BK. Can't wait to read The Idiot and Devils."
"1977",1976,"Anita","Absolutely amazing psychological study of the human mind and soul. Oh the depths of evil it is capable of committing. I absolutely loved this book and felt the agony of the conflict in Raskolnikov's soul. I enjoyed the window into that period of Russian history as well. I love the way Dostoyevsky describes the human soul and how recognizable the human heart is even across cultures and more than a century of time. I think what I really love the most about this book is the depth of the redemption that happens in Raskolnikov's heart."
"1978",1977,"Denis Onichshenko","I love Dostoevsky. Although not my favorite story by him, I feel a bit different about it every time I have a chance to re-read this book. Guess it must reflect the maturity of my inner being. "
"1979",1978,"Erik Johnson","This book is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone. I thought it was going to be a tough read, but it was really pretty breezy. The ""who dunnit"" aspect of this novel is not the intriguing part, because you know who did it. The study of Raskolnikov's psyche makes this book the most fascinating thing I have read since the biography of John Adams. "
"1980",1979,"Heidi Jo","Brilliant. You don't really realize it until its all over, but Dostoyevsky explores the conscience and psyche like no other book I've read. His tale takes the reader expertly through all the stages involved in true redemption. It is Russian, and sometimes the names are tricky to keep track of (being as how every character is known by at least three names), and it can be a bit thick to get through, but it is well worth the effort."
"1981",1980,"Tommaso Valarani","E' sicuramente il suo miglior romanzo. Non fatevi spaventare dalla mole: è un libro che non annoia mai. Anzi è molto scorrevole, fluido. L'assassinio è solo il pretesto per mettere in mostra i difetti e i tratti caratteristici della Russia di quel tempo. Tutto condotto con incredibile maestria, con la storia che si dirama in più direzioni senza mai perdersi."
"1982",1981,"Jack Murphy","Incredibly challenging and oftentimes very dark. I found that the overall suspense of the plot was enough to help me push through it. I have not read another work that comes anywhere close to the level of depth and detail that went into Dostoyevsky's psychoanalysis of his protagonist, Raskolnikov. And I will just say that the ending of this work is superb. I do not usually cry when I read. I did this time. "
"1983",1982,"Owen","My introduction to Russian literature. Great writing! Deals with the questions of do we really have a conscience and what later became known as the will to power. A crime story told from the perspective of the criminal. Maybe the first and finest psychological thriller."
"1984",1983,"Alita","I am nearly done re-reading this book for the first time since AP English 10 years ago. For high school English, reading Raskolnikov's story was an interesting, if slightly difficult, task, and not much more. For the here and now, it is a pleasure. If you've the desire to read up on the highly cliched and much-maligned 'human condition,' read this after New Year's. I especially recommend this to fellow travelers who also read it but grasped little in high school."
"1985",1984,"Tifnie","This book is now added to my favorite list and probably one of the more cerebral reads. Crime and Punishment is about an educated young man who commits an unthinkable crime. His punishment isn't being convicted and sentenced to prison, but rather a lifetime of servitude...in hell...in his mind. Fyodor Dostoevsky did a fantastic job of taking a criminal, twisting the fate, and allowing the reader to feel compassion for someone who would normally be cast aside."
"1986",1985,"Biblio Curious","While reading this, I discovered that books read like a meal. Some are potato chips, others are a backyard BBQ. This one is a buffet or a hearty steak with lots of side dishes. The descriptions are enough to seriously draw you in, like smelling an amazing BBQ down the street. I find this book is better to read in slightly longer sittings because FD creates a world for his characters. After a couple of pages, you can really get into his world. But one shorter reads (10 minutes or so) it's a little tricky to follow the storyline because there is a lot of philosophy and cool quotes. I'll reread this one many times because of the philosophy and I actually care about the characters (1st time in a long time, I'm left feeling I truly know the characters). No spoilers but, FD knows how to serve up an ending! With a title like Crime and Punishment, the mood is a dark and stormy night. But FD never depends on cliches to describe things unless it's more powerful to do so. FD is consistent all the way through with the story and where he brings the characters. I'm moved. Super moved by this book. I read the Bantam Classic version translated by Constance Garnett (March 1981 Version) Her translation is excellent. "
"1987",1986,"Bonch","Classic! I never thought I'd enjoy reading it because I was a bit prejudiced towards Russian literature being tedious but Crime and Punishment was 'unputdownable.' I literally couldn't put it down so I just took it wherever I went until i finished it. You just can't stop reading because you want to know if Rodia will voluntarily give himself up or will he get found out. Puts you on edge and makes you feel antsy. It was a terribly good read and I am astounded that we never took this on in Literature - that this was never part of our reading puzzles me. "
"1988",1987,"Edward Jones","When people saw I was reading this, several warned that it was heavy and a tough read. I can't say I found that at all... I enjoyed the many entertaining and intelligent characters, especially Porfiry. It was nice to see even the conniving Svidrigailov committing some good deeds by the end. Plus plenty of intrigue as Raskolnikov wrestles with his concious - though perhaps the title ruined the ending a bit. I wonder if Dostoyevsky thought that through properly."
"1989",1988,"Eliane","J’ai dévoré ce chef d’œuvre évidemment ! analyse psychologique dans la Russie misérable d’il y a 150 ans , bouleversante question : le crime est-il permis s’il peut aider beaucoup d’autres personnes ? J’aimerais bien voir la pièce de théâtre ! "
"1990",1989,"Ştefan"," Crime and Punishment  was the second of Dostoevsky's most important, mature fictional works.The novel is a psycho- logical account of a crime. A young man of middle-class origin who is living in dire need is expelled from the university. From superficial and weak thinking, having been influenced by certain ""unfinished"" ideas in the air, he decides to get himself out of a difficult situation quickly by killing an old woman, a usurer and widow of a government servant.Among Soviet critics,  Crime and Punishment  fared the best of any of Dostoevsky's novels, because it lends itself better than any other to the view that it is an attack on the evils of capitalist society-- poverty, recognition of birth or class rather than ability, and so on. The novel is a political pamphlet, written to attack the progressive ideology of the time. It is a social document, reflecting the evils of the time, despite Dostoevsky's clearly anti-progressive sentiments. It is a psychological study, a realistic novel in which Dostoevsky has captured the workings of a specific period of history and a specific type of society on the minds of his characters, especially the character of Raskolnikov. The novel is not realistic, but symbolic, and portrays the conflict of different ideas on the battlefield of man himself; not historical, individual man, but man in all times and places. "
"1991",1990,"Martin","If you have the patience and tenacity to make it through this classic, you will be well rewarded. I am not an expert on Russian literature, but I felt drawn into the world of 19th century Russia, and into the mind of the protagonist, Raskalnikov. He repetitive language makes it a struggle, but a worthwhile one. "
"1992",1991,"Christopher Roberts"," This novel confirmed something negative about Dostoyevsky that I felt while reading his other works, The Idiot in particular. His major flaw as a writer is that he is bad with structure. This is because Dostoyevsky is more interested in the philosophical ideas he is expressing than the story he is telling. This means that rather than the philosophy of the work being expressed through the logical actions of the characters and their emotional arcs the characters often feel like puppets to the plot and mouthpieces for the author. Tolstoy had a lot of philosophy in Anna Karenina and often the novel would simply stop so that characters could discuss politics or another topic, but this only happened when it felt logical and it could develop the characters further.  With this rather lengthy caveat out of the way, I will still say that Crime and Punishment may be a masterpiece. The ideas that Dostoyevsky expresses and explores in the novel overcome how clunky his structure is and the characters are rich enough that they overcome how they often seem to be manipulated by the author's whims. The protagonist, Raskolnikov, is a man motivated by ideas, so the style of Dostoyesky's writing fits this characters state of mind. This helps put the reader into a state where they can understand his committing of murder, even though the act is inexplicable from any kind of emotional reckoning of human behavior.  While the work is a large ambitious philosophical novel, it is unavoidable that a contemporary reader see the tropes of twentieth century crime fiction appear. These are most obvious with the relationship between the protagonist and the police. It could be argued that it was Dostoyevsky who created these tropes in the first place and they would be later streamlined into the works of pulp of the early twentieth century.  Like many crime novels, this work deals with the struggle against nihilism. Some later crime novels would give into it, often in an ironic or comic fashion, but Dostoevsky is fighting against nihilism wholeheartedly. "
"1993",1992,"Vinson","Few books in my life actually altered - however slightly - my existing disposition. Crime and Punishment, however, was one of them.Dostoevsky does a masterful job of presenting a tortured intellectual: a man with noble ideals that are easier to imagine than to implement. I found Raskolnikov's undulations from heroic Übermensch to terrified inmate of his own conscience pleasurably tortuous.I may one day make this the only book I've reread among the hundreds I've injested because the belied nuance and power of Dostoevsky in this novel make this his magnum opus."
"1994",1993,"Dany Sharar","I think that Dostoyevsky's 'Crime and Punishment' is not so far from a lot of Indian works of fiction in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Both referred to the deep and large cavity between the rich and the poor in an assigned community. The classical moral lesson, almost spiritual, that the good should be rewarded in those works, was always present."
"1995",1994,"Melody","I'm about half-way into this, and it's rather gruesome. We'll see how it turns out. The author was a Christian, so I'm quite curious to see how it ends.UPDATE Finished it about two weeks or more ago. Was very pleased with the ending. Made for a satisfying read.:)"
"1996",1995,"Lord Tedward","Fyodor DostoevskyCrime and PunishmentNew York: Barnes and Noble Books, 2007538 pp. $8.95978-1-59308-081-5A fantastic peice of literature, Fyodor Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" is a great read, and impossible to put down. The story of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov grips the reader from start to finish. Though it was first written nearly 150 years ago, ""Crime and Punishment"" is still an engaging and absorbing tale.Raskolnikov, a former law student and teacher, is a chracter of remarkable phsycological depth, into which Dostoevsky delves into in great detail. He leaves school and stops working, only to sit in his small, cramped room and think. When the idea to kill Alyona Ivanovna, an old spitefull pawnbroker, occurs to Raskolnikov, he initially dismisses it. However, the idea keeps coomiing back to him, causing him much grief. When Raskolnikov finally ends up acting on his idea to kill Alyona Ivanovna, he ends up unexpectedly murdering her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna as well. He thought that he was justified to kill Alyona Ivanovna, but his killing of Lizaveta deeply troubles him.The ensuing game of cat and mouse between Raskolnikov and the detective assigned to the case, Porfiry Petrovich, is of particular intrest. Their mutual knowledge of criminal phsycology and questioning of suspects create an interesting competition, though Raskolnikov has a major disadvantage. That is to say, his feelings of irritability, guilt, angst, and the effects, both mental and physical, that these have on him result in him seriously compromising himself, even foolishly so, on more than one occasion.""Crime and Pucishment"" is a must-read for anyone interested in human phsycology (especially criminal phsycology), detective novels, or 19th century Tsarist Russia."
"1997",1996,"Sarah Elizabeth Chitwood","Dostoyevsky approaches human nature in a critical manner, examining the rationale behind the actions which exceed mere existence. Entangling his reader in a web of understanding, Dostoyevsky transcribes the human spirit's capacity to bear fault, that of one's self and of others. Even if one repudiates their sins, that capacity takes on virtue, love among many, to acknowledge that the soul endures punishment in one way or another for a reason. "
"1998",1997,"Ms. Molly Clarkson","Dostoyevsky's story and the ideas of the novel need little discussion, however, as I re-read the Pevear / Vohonsky translation for the second time, I was reminded of just what a difference contemporary translations make. It's fair to ask why a frequently-translated novel like this one might benefit from being translated yet again, and in this case, I feel that the translators' work is well worth reading the novel again.

"2010",2009,"Scott Rachui","What an amazing book. From time to time, I pick up classic novels that interest me, and this one caught my eye just in time for a week of vacation. It's the story of a man who commits a gruesome crime, and the moral struggle he goes through as a result.The book takes place in Russia in the 1800s, and it does a good job of describing the society and peoples of that time. It also does a good job as a suspense story. Not only is Raskolnikov (the murderer and main character) wracked with guilt and increasingly sick as a result of his moral agony, but the police are closing in.This book works primarily as a morality play, exploring the consequences on a man's soul when he does something as awful as murder a woman for her money. It looks very candidly at issues of good and evil, guilt and repentance, and ultimately grace and redemption.I wish more writers today dealt with the ethical issues of our world. It seems that the modern authors are increasingly relativistic, amoral, and even nihilistic. Not so with this novel. It's almost philosophical in the way it asks the hard questions, and in how it deals with the inevitable answers.I can easily see why Dostoyevsky is considered one of history's great authors. He deserves the title without question. This book is a great monument to his genius."

"2012",2011,"M.G. Bianco","The slow start of this book is worth pushing through. I began it about a year ago, got through five chapters, put it down and forgot about it. I picked it up again, three days ago, starting from the beginning, and finished it. What an amazing story.Dostoyevsky is a talented writer, what great insight to the human condition. Raskolnikov is a nihilist who imagines himself one of the superiors of the human race--the kind who cannot do wrong, for him there is no law. He sets out to prove it. Yet, in attempting to prove it, he realizes that he is not one of the superiors, and he must come to understand why.The interactions between Raskolnikov and police officers, lawyers, friends, family, neighbors, and enemies are particularly insightful as to human condition. The psychology that goes into the cat-and-mouse question and answers, the games they play to conceal their true motives, intentions, and feelings, and power of their eyes--especially for the more aware and attentive, like his sister, Dounia--to see the unspoken, the unannounced, the concealed, are powerful, gripping, and moving aspects of the story.It would be a great and enjoyable study to discover Dostoyevsky's meaning and usage of the color yellow. It appears continuously throughout the story, and is always mentioned with purpose, it seems. But, alas, that is for another reading of it."

"2022",2021,"Jinju Bang","	If you like thrilling investigation of a mysterious murder case and deep psychological study of a mind of a criminal, this is the book you want to read. “Crime and Punishment” is a suspense-thriller book written by a Russian novelist, Fyodor Dostoevsky, that deals with murder, criminal mind, and investigation.The story mainly takes place in the slums of St. Petersburg in the 1860s, which sets a grim and depressing atmosphere in the story. The streets crawl with drunkards and molesters and poverty is witnessed everywhere. Rodya Raskolniknov is the main protagonist of the novel who ends up murdering the pawnbroker and so begins the story. Other significant characters include Alyona Ivanovna, who is the pawnbroker that Raskolnikov murders, Dounia Raskolnikov, who is Raskolnikov’s sister, Porfiry Petrovitch, who is the magistrate in charge of investigating the murder case, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, who is the stingy, rude fiancé of Dounia, and Sonia Marmeladov, who is the person Raskolnikov eventually comes to love.  The story revolves around the poor student, Raskolnikov, who lives in a small garret barely big enough to fit in a sofa and a small table. He despises Alyona for cheating him out of his money when he is already drenched in poverty and eventually decides to kill her after a long internal conflict with himself, which marks the beginning of the actual story. After murdering both Ivanovna and her sister, Lizaveta, Raskolnikov is thrown off into a deep confusion and delirium. Still mentally unstable, he confesses his crimes to Zossimov at Crystal Palace, but says it was all a joke. Later, he spots Marmeladov dying in the streets, ran over by a horse carriage, and brings him home which leads to the start of his relationship with Sonia Marmeladov. Afterwards, Raskolnikov ends up confessing that he is the murderer who killed the Ivanovna sisters to Sonia. After some more events occur including Porfiry’s interrogation, he goes to Sonia to tell her that he is ready to turn himself in and he does. Raskolnikov receives an 8-year sentence in a Siberian prison. There, he recovers from his long “illness” and begins to change, coming to feel love toward Sonia. I did not get to finish reading the whole book, but I enjoyed reading it very much from the beginning of the novel to the point I ended up in. Dostoevsky’s sophisticated interpretations and descriptions of Raskolnikov’s state of mind which goes through many changes throughout the story impressed me greatly. He vividly illustrates the unstableness Raskolnikov is constantly thrown off into with writings such as, “Suddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple question perplexed and bitterly confounded him,” and, “… Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been worrying myself. … I shall get well and I shall not worry. … But what if I don’t get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!’ ”(p.105). This truly adds more depth and intensity to the book which draws the reader’s attention and helps to engage more easily with the characters and in the story. I believe the target audience for this book is any adults in the society. I can easily tell that this book is definitely not for the kids to read since it deals with a heavy topic like “murder” and uses high-level words such as “unscrupulous” and “prevaricate.” This book is for people that are living in and experiencing a bigger world who are or have learned to interact and make bonds with newer and more variety of people. I think Dostoevsky wanted his audience to see the world through Raskolnikov’s eyes and feel it with his state of mind under the situations he was in, which Dostoevsky’s own character has a relation to, as a result of the kind of life he went through before writing this novel.  I gave this book a five out of five stars because I honestly was fascinated to read this wonderfully written novel and even though it gave me many confusions because of the main character’s continuous feverishness, I consider it as my lack of ability to fully understand the situations and also, one of the charms this book can give. I was not able to finish to the end, but it provided me with a fresh entertainment while I was reading it, so I would say this book deserves a five star rating. On my own time, I would like to give myself an opportunity to finish reading this amazing piece of work. "
"2023",2022,"Peter","I forst read this in high school and was mesmerized. It is the first book that I could not put down. Dostoyevsky puts you into the mind of a killer being chased by the police and makes you feel all his angst and panic. "
"2024",2023,"Grhn","açıkcası kitabı okurken kendimi kitabın ana kahramanı raskolnikovun yaşadıklarına duygularına aklından geçenlere kendimi hiçde yabancı hissetmedim hatta bir çok yerinde kitabın gidişatına göre bende raskolnikovun içinde çırpındığı ruhsal durumlarda buldum kendimi ..."
"2025",2024,"Ejh","Dostoyevsky gets into your mind in the same way Raskolnikov's crime creeps into his, brooding in the corners and sometimes quiet but a presence that you can't shake off. There is nothing dated and off about Dostoyevsky's expressions or any falsity in the characters' relationships - everything was harsh and real. The key characters have such intense and vivid personalities; yet it is their flaws which make them so irresistible. "
"2026",2025,"Murad Khalid","best thing i have ever experienced.. Fyodor just did it with perfection."
"2027",2026,"Richard","I'm giving this five stars for certain scenes and sequences that are tragic and funny and true all at the same time. Real classics. Be warned, though, you have to wade through a lot of dated philosophizing and psychological monologues to get to the good bits. When Dostoevsky sticks to the basic story he's telling, putting his characters through their paces and describing their world,it's as good as literature gets. "
"2028",2027,"Jodi","If anyone wants some insight to the Russian culture and human nature this is the book! I'm prejudice just because I appreciate the Russians. How we live and were raised is a HUGE part of who we are. "

"2031",2030,"Chris Lawnsby","If you've killed an old woman, and you're kinda going crazy, and you've got two people pulling you in opposite directions, follow the humble, beautiful and pious Christian girl over the nihilistic, self-loathing pedophile."
"2032",2031,"Pam","I have not read this book since high school, and honestly, I thought I wouldn't get through the first 100 pages. I just thought I might end up teaching it next year, and I would give it a shot. After about page 35, I just couldn't put the book down. It is like Dickens only in this very accessible Russian way, and I just fell in with the characters and their plights and their triumphs. I couldn't believe the ending, not the way I remembered it at all - and I can see once again why the classic literature gives us new insights in each stage of our lives. I'd recommend waiting until the late fall or deep winter to give this one a read, just for the mood and the need for steaming tea as you turn the pages."
"2033",2032,"Connor Robertson"," When I tried to take this book out of the school library in fourth year, my English teacher told me that.. 'the day that you read Crime and Punishment is the day that I die.' I read it last week and I'm not sure how she's getting on but I am a whole lot better after reading this! I have never read a book that deals with so many aspects of modern life as this does. Poverty/Wealth, Sanity/Insanity, Love/Hate, Life/Death, Morality/Immorality. Philosophy, Psychology, Culture, Religion, Science, Humanity! "
"2034",2033,"Lance","Dostoevsky is, without a doubt, the master of the associative mind in this novel. The entire book represents the working of a mind that relies on reason alone, without love or intuition (or God for that matter). He has masterfully made an intricate philosophical argument through fiction that, even today, retains its power. Though subtle, he is showing how the West's obsession with reason is a kind of monomania itself, an example that should not be followed by the Russians. The novel ends with the hope of an ""unknown reality,"" perhaps the mysticisms that can be found in the East, and, perhaps, even in Eastern Orthodoxy itself."
"2035",2034,"Cheryl","Crime and Punishment is probably my favorite book. Dostoevsky is an incredible writer who creates deep, realistic characters and impeccable plots. One of the reasons that I love this book so much is that it full of wisdom--there is so much to be learned from it about human nature and oneself. I absolutely adore this book and would recommend it to anyone."
"2036",2035,"Justin Olds","One might think of this as an inverse detective novel. Dostoevsky has a real talent for moving the reader from looking over the shoulder of the character to looking through the lens of the characters eyes. This story takes a bit to get going and the Russian names can be a bit of an encumbrance, but once the story begins to climb it keeps reaching higher and higher. Some of the scenes are truly stunning. Here are two of my favorite passages:“... power is only granted to those who dare to stoop and pick it up. There is only one thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare!...And you mustn’t suppose that I didn’t know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether I had the right to gain power- I certainly hadn’t the right.... If I worried myself all those days, wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly of course that I wasn’t Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony of that battle of ideas I wanted to find out something else; it was something else that led me on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse like everybody else or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or not, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling creature or whether I have the right...""""The peasants have vodka, the educated you people, shut out from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams and visions and are crippled by theories; foreigners have sprung up and are amassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery""Definitely recommend it for anyone that feels that they endure a ""battle of ideas"" in scenarios where others float by. Cheers,-Justin"

"2040",2039,"Carla Perez","I read this novel in high school, as an accident and a teachers insisyence i follow through. I was never more thankful to read a novel of this size. It is beautifully written and remains one of my all time favorites. :) thanks Mr. Helmling."
"2041",2040,"Eric Kibler","Was there ever a more exasperating character than Raskolnikov? He's so full of contradictory traits, that he's among the most realistic of all literary protagonists. Yet you'll find yourself yelling at him quite a bit, if you're the type that talks back to books. He just keeps shooting himself in the foot, all the while thinking himself superior to the others around him.In addition to having one of the most fascinating characters, this novel is one of the most suspenseful page-turners of all 19th century novels. It's also a great glimpse into Russian life and culture. The grasping plight of the poor, who are yet able to be incredibly generous. The fondness for wild philosophical discourse over tea or vodka, The ""I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine"" system of doling out bureaucratic jobs. The passionate emotional intensity. The gregariousness. The sense of hospitality. The way that 19th century Russian culture was in thrall to French and English culture.Ultimately, this is a crime novel where the identity of the criminal is known, but the struggle is not between the criminal and the law, but between the criminal and himself. "
"2042",2041,"Micahb","wow. this is another book I would've enjoyed reading with a group as I feel there was much more to digest than just what I was able to glean from the writing. still, I really enjoyed the book and the stories therein. a sad tale all in all, until the very last chapter, but a deep look into the true punishment that comes from inherently criminal actions."
"2043",2042,"Miffy","It took me a while to read this - it was hard at first with all the Russian name variations used in the book. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down! This has to be one of my favourite books. Two things impressed upon me, they were Dostoyevsky's complete understanding of women and their plight, and his incredible insight into the human psyche. The setting is described in such detail that it would be hard not to imagine yourself there. This story will stay with you long after you finish reading it. I highly recommend it."
"2044",2043,"martha","i've read this book three times. i first read it when i was 16 and i became fascinated by raskalnikov's character. i read it again at 20 and 26 and my fascination with it only grew more. a fantastic book that delves deep into the human psyche and all of its intricacies."
"2045",2044,"Ivana Matic","This book amazed me, the style of writing is really good, the book is intense and different from other books which makes it more interesting. I love philosophical books and this is definitely one of them. Such a great novel!"

"2048",2047,"Charlie Regan","Maybe the best book ever written. Tip for the reader: Make a character list as you read. It gets confusing because there are so many characters and many are close to being the same."
"2049",2048,"Andrea Cantú","El autor crea un relato sumamente original, y reúne las piezas de manera sutil. Cada parte del libro juega con las emociones y con el aspecto psicológico. Cada uno de los personajes es perfectamente bien logrado, hasta llegar al punto en que crees conocerlos. De principio a fin se proponen muchas cuestiones de ética y filosofía en los monólogos del personaje principal. Es un juego mental fuerte e inesperado.Nunca antes un clásico me había mantenido tan intrigada. Es uno de los pocos libros que he leído de manera pausada para no acabarlo. Disfruté cada capítulo."
"2050",2049,"Ankur Jha","""Torments and tears- after all, that is life, too. But he felt no remorse for his crime.""A haunting tale of the psychological torments one faces when he is up against his own conscience and that of the society. A life changing tale, a must read for anyone who hitherto didn't know the true meaning of redemption and resurrection and seeks to see them face to face."
"2051",2050,"Diana Caissie","This is honestly one of my favorite books of all time. I think the moral dilemma that Raskolnikov is in, compounded by his illnesses which are brought on by his lack of food and maybe also by sleeping under bushes is something all students can identify with, though usually not on such a grand scale. This is the first book that I cried reading the ending and then for a few minutes after I closed the book."
"2052",2051,"CJ Horton","Phenomenal. Dostoyevsky puts us into the mind of a troubled young man dealing with the turmoil of a gruesome act. Beautiful prose transport us to a world that is dark and suspenseful. A must read for anyone looking for a great classic."
"2053",2052,"Heidi","I started reading this a few years ago and somehow lost interest, but recently picked it up again and read through slowly this time, savouring each word. Everything is vivid and poignant. Though I would like to befriend young Raskolnikov, the murderer, I don't want him to get away with his crime; his freedom would be his death. "
"2054",2053,"Gregory","I'll admit to not ""getting"" this celebrated classic for a good chunk of the reading. It had plenty of dragging moments, with character reactions that were so over-the-top that it was jarring. And yet there were also plenty of moments that the story just zipped along, and I found myself enjoying it immensely. It wasn't until I finished the last page that everything clicked, and I realized just what the story was trying to achieve. In the end, it will likely be one of the most memorable reads I'll ever have."
"2055",2054,"Tamcamry","•	I had forgotten (or perhaps never knew) just how intellectual this book really is. Dostoyevsky asks many questions that make you stop in the midst of reading the story and think. Are there these so-called over-men who the law has no sway or hold over? Possibly. Can one horrible act be wiped away by a hundred acts that better all of humanity? It’s a very difficult question. Especially when you consider in this situation that the ‘horrible act’ at first was not all that horrible. The death of the despicable pawn-broker was lamented by no one. When considering the death of the kind sister, one would truly see horror, but only in the act itself and not the intent of the original plan. Overall, anyone who wants to challenge themselves to think about humanity in a different way needs to read this book. Also, I really did understand and perceive things in a completely different way reading it for the second time after seven years. I’m very glad I went back and read this book."
"2056",2055,"Lindsay","Dostoevsky is one of those authors I've always been meaning to read, but was kinda intimidated by and kinda like ""Eh, I'll get around to that later."" I'm glad I finally followed up on the recommendations of many friends and took the plunge with Crime and Punishment. It just seems like one of those awful books you'd have to slug through in high school and have weekly reading quizzes to make sure you were actually reading the thing and not the cliff notes. I was surprised that given its length it keeps moving along and maintains the tension. I think more than the whole crime and punishment theme I like the interactions between the characters in the story-- they are so perfectly articulated. There are some histrionic moments and some character's musings that I admittedly skimmed through a bit (mainly Svdrigaylov. Like ugh, just get out of the story already). The ending seems to wrap up a little too neatly, but jeez you gotta end the 550 pages somehow. All-in-all I found it entertaining and thought-provoking. "
"2057",2056,"Mirakissanpoika","Pure genius. My favourite book of all time. It's a story about a very educated young man who has a theory regarding the greatest, most influential and the most savagest people ever born. He so desperately wants to be included in this group, that he tries to act entirely out of his own character in order to fit in. Needless to say, in the end when he realises that he's never going to be anything but your average joe, he finds peace, love and happiness. "
"2058",2057,"Jonathan De dios","Intenso, complejo, lleno de detalles sobre la psicología humana, crudo, extenuante, revelador. Algo que distingue a una obra literaria clásica de una obra promedio es lo impactante del mensaje a pesar de la época en que es escrita, vemos como en este caso Dostojevski en esta obra hecha a mediados del siglo XIX retrata a fondo el alma y la naturaleza humana y hace una objetiva crítica social. Es una novela de obsesión que termina con una nueva historia que comienza, la del hombre, en este caso Raskalnikov que después de ser víctima de sus decisiones y atravesar por un gran sufrimiento tiene la oportunidad de empezar de nuevo a través de una regeneración progresiva que como nos dice el autor es tema de otro relato."
"2059",2058,"Soma","what a great novel to show the psycology of a clever almost mad man. i really loved his talks with porfiry, the examinig magistrate. knowing about russian society that time is like a journey into different culture and time.Dostoevsky was perfectly acquainted with the new theories and ideas that people talked about and shared..His 'Raskolnikov.' was very helpful to many psychologists especially Freud..and to me it was fascinating to feel his madness, depression and finally his resurrection through love and suffering."
"2060",2059,"Claudia Gil franco","""...El sufrimiento y el dolor son siempre necesarios para la conciencia de altos vuelos y para el corazón profundo. A mi modo de ver, los hombres verdaderamente grandes han de experimentar una pena inmensa en este mundo — añadió de súbito, pensativo, incluso con un tono distinto del de la conversación."" "
"2061",2060,"Oli Jordan","The most complex and concise novel I have ever read in terms of character models, social anxieties, madness, injustice and life; this is the novel that leaves you feeling sick and engrossed at all times. You love and care for some characters, and you hate and despise others; but overall for me, it was the feeling of inevitability and pity that left me on edge by the end."
"2062",2061,"Isaac Timm","It was 656 pages...just a note. Better minds then mine have analyzed and dissected his book; I'll just say that Crime and Punishment is one of the four books on the human condition that everyone should read. The others are To Killing a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee, In Cold Blood by Truman Capote, and Les Misérables by Victor Hugo. I will probably read this book several more times."
"2063",2062,"Mohamad","زيبا ترين كتابي كه تو عمرم خوندم.در عين حالي كه به مسائل بسيار عميق فلسفي و اخلاقي مي پردازه و بسياري از سوالاتي كه هميشه تو ذهن آدم بوده رو دوباره مطرح مي كنه، رمان بسيار جذاب و گيرايي هست."
"2064",2063,"Anna Serene","This is a book that studies the goodness and evils of humanity. The main character, Raskolnikov, commits the murder of two women, believing that in doing so he would help many more people than he would hurt. He believes that there are people who have the right to harm others if it will benefit the greater good. He believes that the world is separated into two kinds of people: ordinary and extraordinary. Naturally, he believes he is among the extraordinary people, evidenced by his utter disdain for his fellow human beings. The interesting thing about this book is how Dostoyevsky manages to portray different kinds of evil. There is Raskolnikov, but he also has foils for him, like Pyotr Petrovich, who is a pure materialist who cares nothing for anyone and wants to take Raskolnikov's sister, Dounia, as a possession, to be worshiped as a god for ""rescuing her from the blight of being poor"". There is also Svidrigailov who is smart and cunning, who exhibits depraved behavior towards women, but who ultimately cannot handle his fantastic delusions to be destroyed. On the other side, you have the good. Dounia, Raskolnikov's sister, is a strong, independent woman who takes care of herself, and her mother, while also trying to take care of her brother. She has an innate sense of goodness to her that makes her so different from her brother, and it gives you perspective of the sacrifices she is willing to make. Meanwhile, Raskolnikov is selfish and isolated to the point that he does not care for the feelings of others, even his own family. There is also Sonya, a girl who was forced to prostitute herself to get money for her family after her drunk of a father spends it all on booze. Sonya is deeply religious, something that she uses in order to survive. If she did not believe in God, she would never be able to live with herself. When asked what would happen when her step-mother died, leaving her three siblings to Sonya's care, Sonya says that God won't let anything bad happen to them. She says this, but it is only a delusion. After all, if she looked closer she would have to see that God had let her become a prostitute, so what would make her little sister worthier of a better fate? I found it particularly interesting how Dostoyevsky uses religion as a tool. He does not particularly use it as redemptive just through belief, but he does see it as a means that people use to come together as a society. Therefore, when Raskolnikov opens the Bible at the end, he is not necessarily becoming a believer, but he is breaking out of his narcissistic isolation and becoming a member of society.But still that beating the horse to death was fucked up. I get the allegory but still you had an attempted rape that was so tame it was almost unclear what was happening but that dream was horrific and traumatizing. DON'T TRAUMATIZE ME DOSTOYEVKSY!"
"2065",2064,"Bishop","this review is actually intended for the new translation by that celebrity translation couple, for some reason couldn't find it on goodreads. anyway, hadn't read it since high school. surprise surprise, it's still good."
"2066",2065,"Nina Pace","This book has left a lasting impression even years after I first read it. Dostoevsky is pure genius, his characters have unprecedented depth, and the setting of this psychological masterpiece draws you so close to the drama you feel as if you were there. His subtle but perfectly crafted exploration of morality, religion, society and redemption remains unmatched. An absolute must read that will engage and impress, despite slightly drawn-out scenes which may bore an impatient reader. With so much under the surface, the reader experiences something new each time they reread the masterpiece. Subtle inclusions often have concealed meaning that only serve to enrich what is already a compelling narrative. One of the best novels of all time. "
"2067",2066,"Matt","This is Dostoevsky's best novel in my opinion. He did a wonderful job with his characterizations where you almost feel like you look into the soul is his characters. This is the first Dostoevsky novel I have read and I highly recommend it. "
"2068",2067,"Ian","I finished this several hours ago and, in respect of putting my thoughts down here, have picked up and put down the keyboard half a dozen times since. After an uncertain start I grew to love Crime and Punishment, my first attempt at any of the great classics of Russian literature. The range and depth of human emotions that Dostoevsky instils in every character is breath taking and the plot compelling through out. The main character, Raskolnikov, is fascinating, the book's great strength is how it deals with his internal struggles, how he initially justifies murder because he considers himself of the elite and then becomes tortured with self doubt. Much of his character beyond this is good, he wants the best for his sister, helps the bereaved wife of a man he barely knew and falls for the orphaned Sonya... although he is often difficult with his best friend, one of the few he has. It's this complicated soul which makes the book so captivating, despite him ostensibly being a risible character due to his callous crime I found myself rooting for him towards the end. Interestingly Dostoevsky turns none of Raskolnikov's family or friends against him when the truth outs. All the characters have great depth and the book is packed with tense, gripping moments. The scene with Dounetchka and Svidrigailoff towards the end, and the latters eventual, grim decision, particularly impressed me. It's not a light read and demands much from its reader but if you're prepared to give it your attention the rewards are rich. I'm still struggling to put into words all I'd like to but hopefully I've conveyed the satisfaction this book gave me."
"2069",2068,"Melinda","My favorite book of all time. I read it once a year and love it more each time. "
"2070",2069,"Eric Jensen","The entirety of the plot is discernible within the first few chapters, but the story is not. Many other reviewers will praise this book as an excellent story of pride, sin, suffering, and redemption. By all means, Crime and Punishment will challenge the reader to consider himself in light of his own suffering, which, for Dostoevsky, is a redeeming agent. The particular crime is born of a vice, pride, and resulting is the testing of a hypothesis: if I am God, I should be able to create and execute my own laws. Guilt and suffering commence as a result of this action, but if this were a story that ended with sorrow, it would not be particularly interesting. A detailed narration of the main character's thoughts details the transformation of the main character - his redemption, and stands as a pungent answer to the problem of evil: we suffer it to be redeemed and transformed. However, with the above having been stated by numerous reviewers, it is also worth discussing the effectiveness of Dostoevsky's particular style (and by extension, Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky translations). Dostoevsky takes his time, preferring to explore the effects of the events of the plot on the main character, rather than those events themselves. Very little actually 'happens' in this book, such that even the most mundane occurrence, story, or dream becomes a potentially major turning point in the story. Additionally, Dostoevsky's mastery of suspense in this particular work is on full display. While a more detailed discussion would ruin some of the plot, when Dostoevsky wants his readers to squirm in their seats under the crushing guilt and anxiety Rodion Raskolnikov experiences, they will squirm. The reader simply feels the same way Rodion does: I know it must happen, but I certainly don't want it too. "
"2071",2070,"Michaela Vystrčilová","Maybe the best book I've read till now. Extraordinary, I love the psychology of the different characters, the thoughts, even the cruelness in the story. It's just an amazing book. I had goosebumps when I finished it"
"2072",2071,"Fatima","Brilliant. Easily anyone’s favorite novel. We all see injustice everywhere even though what looks unfair to you might be totally normal to others. Being in an unfair situation is the cruelest thing that can ever happen to anyone. It is difficult though to explain or justify when you're in such a situation. Dostoyevsky captures that pain clearly in this novel.Summary/Notes:Part 1:Chapter 1:Walking around uncomfortably, avoiding the landlady in a hot summer day because he doesn’t have any money. He is crushed by poverty. He doesn’t care anymore about paying rent but yet he is afraid of going down the stairs and seeing the landlady. He is thinking of doing that terrible thing and thinking of all the details. He thinks his hat might be too noticeable and decides to get another hat. He knows the exact number of steps, 730 to Alyona Ivanovna's house. He is going now to do a rehearsal of his project. He knows Alyona is the only one living on the forth floor, perfect for his plan. He goes there and sees Alyona and tries to memorize the apartment layout. The apartment is clean without a speck of dust. He shows her the pocket watch and she gives him a very tiny amount for it. He left with tremendous confusion. He is sick and horrified of his thoughts and what he plans to do. He notices a tavern on the way back. He goes inside without thinking. He’s never been to one before in his life but he suddenly craves a cold beer and decides to get one. He notices a man that looks like a retired government clerk in agitation.Chapter 2:Although he doesn’t like company, every now and then he enjoys some company. He focuses on the old guy that looked like a retired government clerk who was in desperate shape. The man starts up a conversation with Raskolnikov and tells him his story. His name is Marmeladov. He tells him that he has been sleeping outside for 5 days. He hasn’t cleaned himself. He used all his money on drinking and eventually lost his position in the government which pushed his daughter Sonya into prostitution. He left his wife Katerina Ivanovna with the children with no money. He even stole the prostitution money and left and never came back home for that long. Raskolnikov decides to help take Marmeladov home and sees the poverty the man is suffering from. Raskolnikov sees the poverty and fear in the wife and children’s eyes and decides to leave some money for them although he himself is in poverty as well. He even doubts his decision to give the money out and considers taking it but then changes his mind.Chapter 3:Raskolnikov receives a letter from his mother. Nastasya, the landlady’s only servant, gives it to him. She also cleans his room once a week and brings him tea and food. He kisses his mother’s letter. His mother’s letter was long and in the letter she tells him what had happened to his sister Donia. Donia has been suffering recently because of the family she’s been working for as a governess. The husband was pursuing but Donia was stuck there working for them because of her debt. His wife Marfa heard them once and decides to put the whole blame on Donia. Donia’s reputation gets hammered but eventually the husband decides to publicly tell the truth and Marfa regrets what she did and publicly apologizes for her. A relative of Marfa, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhi, proposes to Donia and she accepts. He is 45 with some money. His mother described their few meetings in the letter which showed Pyotr as a cheap and arrogant person but his mother was oblivious to all of them. At the end of the letter she promises to send more money. Raskolnikov was crying while reading the letter and was in so much pain.Chapter 4:Raskolnikov promises that his sister will never marry that Luzhin guy. He leaves the apartment and walks around. He is thinking about Donia and that cheap, stingy guy. He gets more and more frustrated. His bitterness grow more with every step. He notices a 15 year old girl not walking in a straight line. He believes she’s a drunk. Her clothes were ripped. He gets mad when he sees another man following the girl and decides to protect the girl. A police man comes to the scene and Raskolnikov gives him 20 kopecks for a cab ride to the take the girl’s home. After the incident he starts have feelings of regret, why did he give the money to the police man, why does he care about what happens to girl, why does he care about anything anyway. He forgets why left the apartment and then remembers that he was going to visit Razumihkin, one of his friends from the university although not really as he doesn’t though have friends. He works all the time and doesn’t really socialize with people unlike Razumihkin who is not crushed by failure, he works hard and has many friends and has a very nice personality. He doesn’t seem to give up no what happens to him.Chapter 5:Before reaching his friend’s place he changes his mind. He doesn’t think he can help him with anything. He decides to go there after “IT” happens. He goes back to the apartment and sleeps. He dreams he is sever years old again with his dad. They pass a tavern with a lot of drunk people. He sees the old horse being harassed and hit by those drunk people. Raskolnikov gets so mad and so upset for the poor old horse. He throws himself on the horse and the owners gets mad and demands doing whatever he wants to it. He wakes up from the dream in horror. He leaves the apartment and goes to the market. There he hears that Alyona Ivanovna’s sister was going to be out at 7 in the evening and Alyona would be completely alone.Chapter 6:Raskolnikov overhears another conversation between two people who also had a recent interaction with Alyona. They complained about her unfair interest prices and she abuses her sister to do whatever she asks her for. One of the men even suggests how killing Alyona and distributing the money she has to the poor would probably be a justifiable act to the society. Raskolnikov goes back and prepares for his act. He makes a secure pocket for the axe in his jacket. When he goes downstairs to the kitchen to get the axe he sees Nastasya and blames himself for thinking that the kitchen would be empty. He then leaves and gets the axe from the porter and heads to the place. He reaches the place without anyone noticing him. He goes inside and notices the painters painting in the flat but they don’t see them. He continues going upstairs and rings the bell several times until she answered.Chapter 7:Raskolnikov forces his way in the apartment. He reminds her of why he is here (for the cigarettes case). She goes into the bedroom and he gets his axe out and starts striking her with it. He looks for the keys and notices the necklace she’s wearing. He tries to take it but it was stuck so he uses the axe to get it. He finds the keys and takes the leather purse. He finds the chest under the bed and opens it. It was full of clothes but then he discovers that a lot of watchers, silver and gold are hidden in those clothes. He then hears noise and goes out to discover that the sister never left the house! He goes back for the axe. The sister is defenseless. She doesn’t even cover her face with her hands. He strikes her with the axe. He is frightened now. He begins cleaning himself to leave but then he hears the doorbell. Two people were waiting outside and were suspicious of the situation because the door was locked from the inside. They leave to get help and Raskolnikov takes the chance to leave. He almost comes across the painters as were going out but they don’t see him. He hides in that empty apartment until everyone goes upstairs and then he leaves quickly.Part 2Chapter 1:Raskolnikov is terrified. He goes into deep sleep. He wakes up frightened with a high fever. He hides the stuff he stole. Nastasya comes in with the porter. He needs to go the Police. He is horrified now and knows that the Police found out. He goes there and decides on the way that the best thing is to confess to get it over with. He arrives there and waits while being in a frightened state. They finally tell him that he is here because the landlady complained that he is not paying the rent. He is suddenly relieved and even gets upset at the police man. He signs the required papers and overhears the police talking about the murder. He gets terrified again and believes that the police will know it’s him.Chapter 2:Raskolnikov returns home, collects the jewelry and leaves again. He buries the jewelry under a large stone in a courtyard. He visits his friend Razumikhin and doesn’t remember why he was there but then remembers that he said he will see him after “IT” happens. Razumikhin offers him a job doing translations he first accepts but then rejects the offer. He returns back him and goes back to sleep. He dreams that Ilya Petrovitch is beating the landlady. Nastasya wakes him up and he tells Nastasya what happened but she tells him it was a dream and he is very sick.Chapter 3:Raskolnikov stays in that state for days. Razumihkin stays beside him to take care of him. He wakes up to find a person he didn’t know. He turns out to be delivering money his mother was sending. He learns that he’s been out for four days and he gets scared because he thinks he might’ve said something about the murder. Razumihkin also tells him that he’s been asking for his socks multiple times while he was unconscious. Raskolnikov checks on the socks and gets relieved that the socks were covered by dirt so no one would’ve noticed the blood.Chapter 4:Dr. Zossimov is a 27 year old tall fat man with spectacles. Razumihkin updates the doctor with the status of Raskolnikov and asks if it’s possible for Raskolnikov to attend a gathering tonight. Zametov will be attending who is the chief clerk along with Petrovitch, the head of the investigation department. The doctor and Razumihkin were talking of the murder of Alyona along with her sister. The painters were accused of the murder. One of them had a jewelry box that he claimed to have found on the street. Razumikhin is insisting that the painters couldn’t have committed the crime. Razumikhin gives a full theory of why the painters can’t be the killers. He insists that the killer must’ve been upstairs and once the painters left the apartment he went there and waited for everyone to go back upstairs and then ran out and dropped the earrings on the way. The doctor however thinks that the explanation is too melodramatic and couldn't have happened.Chapter 5:Donia’s fiance arrives asking for Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov doesn’t care for him but also notices that he is very well dressed. Luzhin says that Raskolnikov's mother and sister maybe arrive at anytime now. He tells him where he is making them stay. Razumihkin says that the place is filthy and a dump. Luzhin defends the choice by saying that he didn’t know ahead of time. Luzhin is staying though with Andrea Semyonovitch. Zossimov suggests that one of the clients of Alyona must have killed her. Zossimov thinks that he is a professional killer while Razumihkin thinks the killer is new and that is his first crime because he didn’t take all the jewelry. Luzhin interrupts saying that the killer must’ve been a rich client. Raskolnikov attacks Luzhin saying that he wants to marry his poor sister to have total control over her. Luzhin accuses Raskolnikov’s mother of saying this. Raskolnikov threatens Luzhin of throwing him down the stairs if he talks about his mother again. He leaves right away.Chapter 6:Alone in his room he calms down. He left the apartment. He walks aimlessly. He met Zametov. They started talking and Raskolnikov thanked him for giving him the sock when he was sick. Zametov thought he should still be in bed. He almost confesses to Zametov. He describes what he would’ve done if he was the murderer. He described how he would hide the jewelry under a stone and come back 2 to 3 years after to collect it. Zametov at first started suspecting him but then changed his mind at the end thinking that Raskolnikov is just ill. Raskolnikov bumps into Razumihkin but says that he wants to be alone and rejects his friend’s invitation to his party. He leaves and witnesses a suicide attempt over the bridge. He passes by Alyona’s place and goes inside. He kept ringing the bell over and over again. He said he wants to rent the apartment. The workers was getting annoyed with him. Raskolnikov left and knew that he soon would to the police station and it will all be over.Chapter 7:Oh his way to the police station he witnesses an accident, a man falls under a carriage. It was the drunk man from the tavern days ago. It was Marmeladov. He announced that he knew him and announced that he would pay for the doctor and bring the man home 3 houses away. They bring him home. Katrina doesn’t take the news well. She is panicking because she doesn’t know how to support the family or even pay for the burial. Sonya comes back to see her father and he dies in her arms. Raskolnikov gives money to Katrina and promises to come back and support them. Sonya sends the little girl after Raskolnikov leave to asks him about his name. Raskolnikov likes the little girl and she gives him a hug and cries on his shoulder. He asks her to pray for him as well. He decides to go see Razumihkin and then both go home. Razumihkin tells Raskolnikov that Zametov thinks he’s mad. He told Razumihkin about the conversation he had with Raskolnikov today. He warned him of talking to Zametov like that again. They come back home and discover that his mother and sister have arrived. He sees them and faints.Part 3:Chapter 1:When Raskolnikov recovers he starts by saying that he is opposed to the engagement. He declares that he doesn’t want anyone in the room. Razumihkin takes the mother and sister away. He promised to bring Dr. Zossimov to take care of Raskolnikov. Razumihkin develops feelings for Donia. Razumihkin also tries to fix up the doctor with the landlady because he doesn’t want the doctor and Donia to talk to each other.Chapter 2:Razumihkin wakes up and goes to meet Pulcheria and Donia. They talk about Raskolnikov, how good he is although he doesn’t show it, also of his past involvement with the landlady’s daughter and how wrong that was. Pulcheria shows him the letter they received from Luzhin. He was supposed to meet them last night but didn’t show up. He also apologized for not coming today. He also requested that Raskolnikov not be present when he meets them later today. He also told them about Roskolnikov giving me to the daughter/prostitute of a drunk dying man the other day. She is nervous about the whole situation and even going to see Raskolnikov.Chapter 3:Dr. Zossimov tells them that Raskolnikov is getting better and that he needs to go back to the university to keep himself busy. He is also doing this to impress the mother and Donia. Raskolnikov was thinking about how much he loved his mother and sister in their absence. His mother asks him if he knows what it means to be alone. Raskolnikov remembers the Katrina from yesterday and tells them how he should’ve maybe not given the money away since he doesn’t have any money. Donia also mentioned that Marfa died from the beating from her husband. They go back to the subject of Luzhin. Donia tries to convince him that she made the right choice. Raskolnikov is not convinced but at the end just declares that he doesn’t care and she can marry whoever she wants. They show him the letter sent by Luzhin. They defends his position and says that he didn’t give the money to the daughter but to the widow for the funeral.Chapter 4:Sonya comes to Raskolnikov’s place. She is dressed in cheap clothes. She came because Katrina told her to invite Raskolnikov to the service tomorrow. He invites her in but she felt that as if she is not worthy of sitting next to the ladies. The mother and the sister and leave. The mother is worried about the relationship between Raskolnikov and Donia. She thinks that Raskolnikov must think of a great deal of her. Raskolnikov tells Razumihkin that he needs to see Porfiry (the investigation officer) to see if he can find his father’s watch that he had given to Aloyna. He also asks Sonya for her address so that he can visit her. He asked Sonya how she found his address and she told him that he gave it to her little sister but Raskolnikov didn’t remember. They leave the apartment and Razumihkin jokes about about how he never looks his room! Sonya leaves too and suddenly she feels a strange feeling she never felt before. There was a guy following Sonya to her home. He was tall about 50. He turned out to be her neighbor. (Svidrigailov)Chapter 5:They both go to Porfiry. Raskolnikov is a bit nervous. Zametov is also there. Porfiry said that he needs to tell the lawyer and the lawyer will pursue the thing. Raskolnikov kept insisting that he doesn’t have enough money and that the watch is very valuable and the only thing left from his father. Porfiry said that everyone came for their things except for him right after the murder. Raskolnikov become defensive and said that he was extremely hilarious. Porfiry kept asking him tricky questions, how he was generous with the family yesterday, his article about crime theory recently published. Raskolnikov said jokingly that he found a treasure somewhere. Raskolnikov figures out that he is getting irritated and that doesn’t the case so he tried to calm down. Porfiry also asked if he saw painters two days before the murder. Raskolnikov knew the trick because the painters were only there on the day of the murder.Chapter 6:Razumikhin doesn’t understand why the police men were suspicious of Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov is certain they are. They walked to Raskolnikov’s home. There was a man looking for Raskolnikov. The man calls him “Murderer”. Raskolnikov walks beside him. He asks why he called them a murderer. He doesn’t answer and the man leaves. Raskolnikov returns back to the room, feeling chilled and nervous. He is exhausted and in pain. He is convinced that he didn’t kill a human being but a concept. He had a weird dream of killing the landlady again with the axe. He woke up to find a strange man in his room. The man declares that his name is Arkady Ivanovitch SvidrigailovPart 4:Chapter 1:Svidrigailov goes to see Raskolnikov. He asks him to deliver a message to Dunya. Raskolnikov refuses immediately and asks him to leave. He defends himself saying that he had nothing to do with Marfa’s death. Raskolnikov doesn’t think so. He tells Raskolnikov about Marfa visiting him as a ghost and Raskolnikov thinks he is insane. He tells Raskolnikov that had heard of the engagement and he didn’t think Luzhin is good enough for Donia and he wanted to break it and gives her 10,000 rubles without asking for anything in return. He also tells him that Marfa had left money for Donia in her will.Chapter 2:Razumikhin and Raskolnikov walk together. Razumikhin had met Porfiry and Zametov. They meet Donia with Luzhin and the his mother at a restaurant. Luzhin gets upset. Luzhin tells them about Svidrigailov visiting and how he killed his wife. Donia thinks it’s all gossip. Raskolnikov tells them about the money from Marfa’s well. Luzhin threatens them if he leaves now he would’ve ever come back. Donia tells him to never come back. Luzhin finally complains about how much they had cost him. The mother gets upset because Luzhin is cheap and barely spent money. Luzhin was so angry at Raskolnikov and thinks that he might still have a chance.Chapter 3:Razumikhin is happy with the outcome, finally Luzhin is out of the picture. Raskolnikov tells Donia about the 10,000 rubles. Razumikhin says that the mother and Donia should indeed stay in St. Petersburg and not go back, that they should stay together as a family. Raskolnikov leaves without n...."
"2073",2072,"Rik Mets","Just amazing! The flow of the actions, the thoughts of Raskolnikov, the absurdness of the situations and the ending, which contains some hope. The only creepy thing about it is, that Dostojevski can probably be more or less identified with Raskolnikov. "
"2074",2073,"Akshay Narayanan","A book that is a bit difficult to read. The author takes his time developing the characters and the plot lines. Particularly, the first few pages and the last few pages were a bit dull. The book takes a character, one who could be called a genius or crackpot with equal ease, and really brings him to life. The most brilliant aspect of the book as far as I am concerned is how the author makes you question about everything ranging from religion to law to society and even conscience, and then leaves you to decide for yourself how to feel about each. Certainly not a light read and I would suggest that you read it when you have the time and patience to move through atleast 50-60 pages a stretch. "
"2075",2074,"Alistair Andrew leitch","This book to me is probably the central work of the Christianity-based wing of the literary existentialist movement. What I find to be so wonderful about it is that it has made fashionable so many of the central literary techniques employed in twentieth century literary existentialism (especially in the cases of Kafka, Nick Cave and, to a lesser extent, the surrealists as well). It has fantastic use of character development as a tool towards showing the evolution not only the human character undegoes but also of philosophical ideals; this, of course, is diaphanous as continental literature (and especially Russians like Chekov, Bulgakov and Tolstoy) employ this technique but it is, for me, the seminal example of said technique's proficiency. The question surrounding the Nietzschean (although this book is antecedent to FN) undertones of Raskolnikoff's outlook in relation to the sanctity of life and (prophetically) cultural relativism are so beautifully conveyed throughout not only through the use of his thoughts played out as narrative but also in the vernacular of the characters, giving another layer to the characterisation as a philosophical tool. To give an example of what I mean, Raskolnikoff appears early in the novel to be very blunt, a man of but few words and a very concise user of language. He often employs words such as 'sultry', 'mere' and is derisory at all times in a stereotypically nihilistic manner. Towards the end, he makes a change to being extravagant and lyrical, reflecting a Renaissance-style dialect that is indiciative of his gradual conversion back towards a Christian existentialist stance, which is emplary of the period of time that this style of speech symbolisises. My favourite example being his repeated use of the word 'efficacious' towards his redemption, a word made popular by its use as an adjective of Christ's sacrifice in the KJ Bible, all the while his relationship with Sonia (herself symbolic of Christian values) and the religious images becoming more and more frequent. As well as this picturesque language and remarkable use of character development, this book also touches me on a philosophical level, too. We all love books that agree with our own prejudicial views although we hate to admit it and this is one that does this for me. It is a great depiction of how a nihilistic, yet utilitarian existential morality is, in terms of its application to this example, a philosophical reality. However, the idea of the human heart and sentience means that this inevitability is irrelevent in terms of the sanctity of life is a beautiful amalgamation of traditional morality and the existentialist emphasis on empirical experience. The difference between philosophical theory and philosophical practical, so to speak. A true classic. "

Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up noiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; the morning chill was still keen. She wore her poor old burnous and the green shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and paler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand with her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her hand to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would repel it. He always took her hand as though with repugnance, always seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout her visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply grieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glance at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking. They were alone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.How it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed to seize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms round her knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same moment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her eyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and that at last the moment had come. . . .They wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes. They were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life. They were renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other.They resolved to wait and be patient. They had another seven years to wait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before them!

The story is amazing and the emotions described in the story are very real and relatable. Going in, I was a little afraid of the big Russian novel but now I can say for certain that I am no longer afraid. It was a great book to read, challenging at times but well worth it, as challenging things usually are. For those looking to challenge themselves or start reading classics, I recommend it.

"2082",2081,"Jacob","Providence has a pervading presence in Fyodor Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment. It is a real presence in the story that has a real influence on the key characters. The word providence shows up all throughout the novel. It is evident that this was an important theme to Dostoevsky. Dostoevsky uses Raskolnikov to show how providence’s presence can suffer and haunt a man’s soul and mind. Providence appears as happenstance to Raskolnikov until it is personified in the life of his mother and sister, his lover Sonia, and mysteriously in Raskolnikov. Dostoevsky portrays a providence that works in unconventional ways to bring justice and win the heart of a murderer. Raskolnikov was not a repentant axe murderer. He was an enemy to God and humanity. Yet God, through the medium of providence, confronts Raskolnikov.  It is accepted that providence could work in the life of remorseful murderer. Raskolnikov was no such man, for he did not regret his act of murder and constantly made attempts to rationalize his crime yet the work of providence unavoidable in his life. Providence is seen in three ways in Raskolnikov’s life: in coincidence and being beyond suspicion, in using key characters temper his guilt, and in relinquishing his guilt by showing that there are holes in his rational. 	Providence is the evanescent earthly presence of God that is attributed to visible impressions that it leaves it behind in the form of coincidence, serendipity, or happenstance. Dostoevsky purposely made the providence ubiquitous in the life Raskolnikov to shows how far reaching is the love of God. The influence of providence was not limited to just Raskolnikov. It is seen his surrounding world of strangers and friends as well as the ethereal subconscious world of dreams. 	"
"2083",2082,"Mary Etta","After struggling through the difficult lives the end was wonderful. Reading e-book and listening to audio was helpful as was online resources to keep the names and identities straight. Dostoyevsky is incredible in his ability to portray characters the way that he does. Modern writers rely on more graphic detail to describe such characters. "
"2084",2083,"Malick Kaufman","Raskolnikov. It's all about Raskolnikov. One of the most expertly crafted characters I recall reading, conficted from one hundred different angles, stricken with the most realistic and suspenseful paranoia, filled with hate and love simultaneously, and most of all, he acts like all of us might. It's not the easiest read in the world, but it's well worth it. I imagine reading it again will be with the greatest fondness and ease. Thanks Fyodor. "

"2088",2087,"Rachel Jackson","The last book I read that literally kept me up at night, flipping pages hungrily or worrying about what was happening to the characters when their narrative wasn't in my head, was One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Having begun Crime and Punishment only once before in my life, years ago in high school, and closing it because I wasn't connecting to the characters, I was happily surprised that C&P became that new book on my second read-through.I feverishly read the book from cover to cover every moment I could, and it still wasn't enough. I wanted more. I wanted more of Raskolnikov's past, more of his inner thoughts and guilt(?) and more of how the pressures of his friends of and of society hung down on him.Given the book's title, the entire plot revolves around Raskolnikov's murder, which could have easily been the pivotal point, the climax, but Dostoyevsky makes it happen right away so both we and Raskolnikov are left with the fall-out. And what a journey that is: the madness, the guilt, the anger, the redemption. All is illustrated in Raskolnikov's actions and I couldn't get enough. Although there were parts of the novel that struck me as odd, especially in the way Dostoyevsky introduced new characters, they all came back around to a main point and adequately described Raskolnikov's inner turmoil.I knew what was going to happen most of the book *spoiler alert*— as a whole, it was a bit predictable, especially given Raskolnikov's frequent bouts of indecision about whether to come clean. I knew he would go to the police station eventually, whether on his own accord, dragged by someone else or maybe in death at someone else's hands. I didn't know how, but I knew he would be brought ""to justice."" But I did not see the reemergence of Svidrigailov coming at all, nor did I anticipate his confession to Sonia.But despite surmising that the book would end in that general manner, I found myself wanting to dive deeper into Raskolnikov's head as his thoughts swirled around violently. I felt his illness and madness right after the murder; I felt his anguish and annoyance about his mother and sister; I felt his terror at being questioned or doubted (especially at Porfiry's hands). Dostoyevsky did a masterful job writing a character to whom it was easy to connect — despite the fact that he is a murderer! Raskolnikov as a character was perfect for describing the complexity of human nature when looking at criminals, especially, as his article in the law journal points out. That what was so fascinating to me reading along: hearing Raskolnikov describe his own thought process on his own and prompted by others, to come to a conclusion about what he needed to do.C&P was superb, highly recommended. I will need to let the book set a bit in my brain before I can go back and read it again and soak up everything I missed the first time, everything that ties it all back together. "

"2106",2105,"Marxist Monkey","It is sort of ridiculous to give this book stars. This book is about, among other things, the uselessness, the stupidity, the insult to humanity that such things as star-based rating systems reproduce. I only decided to re-read this classic because my daughter is a big fan of the Manga series, Death Note. And she had read that Death Note is a re-write of C&P. Our whole family read Death Note last summer, and I found it to be more than a Japanese C&P--in fact a lot more about the history of fascism in Japan than about the individual hubris of the main character, Light. But in re-reading C&P, I can see that Dostoevsky was precisely describing the qualities in humanity that lead to a kind of charismatic leadership necessary to fascism. What became interesting for me in that context, however, was the extreme isolation of Raskolnikov. He was never described as someone capable of leadership. He never was strong enough or confident enough to pull off the ultimate crime of eliminating a worthless human. And, in the end, when he recognizes his common humanity, it is presented as a kind of religious confirmation, the common humbleness of all humans before a greater power--which is never confirmed as God, but which is obviously represented as such through the personal devotion of Sonia (insofar as she seems to be like a nun). This aspect of C&P struck me as less interesting than Death Note. In the manga, there is not a need to place the whole ethical conundrum in a religious context. The question is all about what human could possibly claim the right to judge the worth of other humans--to judge it so far as to claim the authority to kill them. That is still a deeply profound question--one we need to continue to ask ourselves as we watch the devastation rain down in Gaza."

A profound study of human nature, from the pits of insanity to the heights of relief.This has to be read O humans! P.S: Fyodor Dostoyevsky, why u write so awesome? "
"2108",2107,"Ted","Simply the best novel I've ever read.It's brilliance lies in its timelessness. This pre-Freudian psychological drama has all the tell tale requirements. Loss, madness, guilt, shame, tenderness and ultimately, a peculiar redemption. Though this book is said to be a redemption book, and it is in some respects, however redemption comes not from an epiphany- it comes from learning to see what is right in front of us. This novel took over a month to finish. Sometimes I had to take a break as the images burned into my psyche and, accordingly, I needed to allow the intense content to steep and to sink in. This is a book to be savored and treated with immense respect.This is the first of my Russian ""big books"" that I've read. I can truly understand their worth. I kept on saying to myself ""how is it possible to write such an intense psychological novel in the mid 1800s Russia?"" For it reads like modern prose- if only we had authors commensurate to Dostoevsky to write the modern day equivalent. I suspect I'll end up re-reading this."
"2109",2108,"Jacynthe","Though I did not have a clearer vision or understanding of Raskolnikov's motives by the end of the book, and though his actions were probably more dramatic than what most of us will do in any lifetime, I did see in his humanity, that lack of being able to predict consequences to actions, especialy negative ones. The selfish human nature that thinks ""how unique I am! what do I need the rest of the world for? that common, nothing-special world?"". In Rodion, in Sonya, even in Svidrigailov and Marmeladov, the lines of good and bad are blured, huge area of grayscale. How can one so generous be a murderer? How can such a sweet lady, daughter of a nice good-for-nothing drunk can become a street-walker? How can a creep skirt-chasser can do so much good for a bunch of unrelated orphans yet still not value his own life? Is it that people exist in parallel to others, yet don't realize how connected everyone is, how dependent we are to each other? Is it that we human beings, are so engrossed in our own little inner world that we forget to care? That we forget that we are nothing without others and that our very uniqueness is only what it it compared to other people's? Apparently, this novel is about redemtion, about salvation, about growth even. For me, it's a BIG jumble of questions on human nature. For a story this deep to touch me even deeper, I cannot thank Dostoyevsky enough... Or should I thank Raskolnikov?"
"2110",2109,"Havre","i read the book when it was ,perhaps,too soon and never could and wanted to get rid of its charming perspective of looking at those so called ""criminals"".raskolnicov is one of those guyes i will never call a fictional character.the guy is my intimate friend.i think he has done what i believe /beleived in for years but never dared to put into practice!i relished in reading the book for three times and ,surely,i'ii read it more than another three times!

"2111",2110,"Pa","Completely agreed with Abby -- C&P is a masterpiece, an unforgettable tale of sin and redemption; it has everything in it for everyone: a psychological thriller, a classic tragedy, a crime/detective novel, and to some extent a historical novel. The psychological insights Dostoevsky displayed here were beyond brilliant. Everything I read immediately after C&P seems trivial and boring. "

"2113",2112,"Roger DeBlanck","Crime and Punishment is the epic tale of one man’s misguided ideologies and his struggle to regain his humanity. When Raskolnikov (a bristly, edgy young intellectual) reasons his way into believing that the elimination of certain despicable individuals will make the lives of others infinitely better, he fails to calculate how his conscience will respond once a crime is carried out. Having resorted to a single murder, he is blindsided by the intense guilt and physical anguish the act inflicts on him. Burdened with grief and ailed with sickness, he begins his quest in search of forgiveness, absolution, and the sacrificial need to find redemption and grace. Dostoyevsky is masterful at probing what constitutes the human soul. What causes a person to snap while later causing him to regret? What forces compel an essentially good man towards committing an evil deed? Crime and Punishment stands at the pinnacle of literature in its attempt to understand how evil tempts us and how goodness regulates our morality. This novel is one that never diminishes in power and value for me, no matter how many times I read it. The emotional journey it captures and the wallop it delivers with its exploration of human frailty and dignity continues to overwhelm me with questions about what is the purpose of life? Why do we suffer? And what does it mean to have compassion? In Crime and Punishment, Dostoyevsky achieves the rarity of defining both the simultaneous horror and beauty that dwell within humanity. "

"2115",2114,"Ashok Sridharan","As with all Dostoyevsky Novels, the characters remain with you long after you have completed reading the book. A dozen years after last reading it, I still vividly recollect the dramatis personae: the protagonist Raskolnikov, who is torn behind mind and heart, Sophia the prostitute with a heart of gold, Marmeladov, the former government servant who has destroyed himself with drink, the protagonist's friend Razumikhin, who serves as the voice of reason in Raskolnikov's life.As with all novels of Dostoyevsky in his prime, Crime and Punishment is a multi-layered novel. At one level its a thriller- a cat and mouse game between Raskolnikov and the wily police officer Porfiry Petrovitch. At another level, its a commentary on late 19th century Russian society, which was undergoing a tremendous socio-economic transformation under the relatively liberal Tsar Alexdanr II after three decades of stagnation and iron-fisted governance under Tsar Nikolai I. At another level, Crime and Punishment recounts the inner conflict of the protagonist Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov. A young student crushed by poverty, Raskolnikov plans to murder the greedy old pawn broker Alyona Ivanovna and use her ill-gotten wealth to escape the desperate poverty in which he is living. His mind tell him that there's nothing wrong in killing a person who does no good to anyone, whose presence will make no difference to anyone. Yet somewhere deep down, his heart knows that logic apart, its a inherently wrong, immoral idea.At yet another level, Crime and Punishment is also a tale of conflict between belief and atheism in a society where people were increasingly prone to rejection of God and religion to materialism and utilitarian thinking. Characteristically, Dostoyevsky presents both perspectives without taking sides. Its a testimony to the genius of Dostoyevsky, that a century and a half after it was first published in 1865, the central themes of Crime and Punishment still remain just as relevant."

Raskolnikov and his need to feel extraordinary versus his compassion."
"2118",2117,"Taysha","This book's title defines it's theme; though no words can begin to describe the brilliance and power of this work.Dostoyevsky accomplishes much more than telling the tale of a murderer and his sentence. With a sympathetic voice he touches upon all sorts of destitution, of depravity, and of crime.I think Dostoyevsky hits upon something that has escaped modern understanding: crime goes far beyond the physical action of murdering someone, or robbing them, or what have you; and the twins of punishment and retribution exist just as much in the murderer's mind as they do in prisons. His recounting of Marmelodov's selfish alcoholism, of Luzhin's narcissim, of Svidrigailov's depraved search of amusement, and finally of Raskolnikov's remorseless egotism is all at once enchanting and chilling. So completely enrapturing is his development of every character and his description of the fates that befall them, that one can't help but cry or gasp or stare at the page with mouth agape at some of the more provoking scenes.My first attempt to read this book was unsuccessful. I dismissed it as boring, as trash, read the plot summary online just so I could spare myself the trouble of 522 pages of reading. And now, after reading the high-strung drama, I can't help but scratch my head at how stupid or how blind I was at that time, to have missed the beauty of this novel.This is among my favorite classic novels, and by far the best crime drama I've ever read (or ever written, period?). I feel my mind, my attitude, my very soul, has been enriched and uplifted through the reading of this novel.As with every great novel I read, this one has left me in a state of wonder and ecstasy akin to intoxication.

"2119",2118,"Jaime Contreras","Mr. Dostoevsky asks the question of mercy, humanitarian treatment of criminals and human dcency in this powerful story about Russian society and its justice system. This is a must-read classic."
"2120",2119,"Edward Weiner","One of the best books ever. Read it for class I will be taking starting in January 2014.

"2121",2120,"Ernesto Alaniz","When I first began reading this book, I did not like it. It was so... dark. This novel is really about a man who is from the Underground. He is lost within his own self. Reading it was frustrating and painful and depressing. But then it changed. And hope reared it's ugly head. And before I know what happened, I was on the edge of my seat. The book is amazing. When i finally laid it down, I got down on my knees, and literally wept over the darkness of my soul and the grace it took to deliver me. Hope barely rears her head... but what hope."
"2122",2121,"Cory Drewry","Unquestionably one of the best books I've read in a long time.

I highly recommend this book to anyone with a passion for great literature."
"2123",2122,"Afxam","Just Fantastic!"
"2124",2123,"janet","Though I haven't killed anyone, I am glad I didn't read this book until I was older. In fact, I am particularly glad that I waited to read it until moving to Kazakhstan where Dostoyevsky had served a prison term and met the love of his life. Of course, one might get a bit tired of Raskolnikov's endless fevers and moods, but the landscape of wonderfully various characters keeps him from becoming tiresome. To be fair, Rodion Romanovitch is dealing with a terrible situation. Funnily enough, I had an oddly short-lived fever while reading this book. Though this novel has often been described as depressing, I found it very funny when the author makes fun of different schools of thought and human failings. If anything, the ending is unrealistically optimistic. I was thrilled to find a clue of how colonized societies can influence the literature of their colonizers in this novel. Allow me to explain. At the end of the novel, Raskolnikov is sitting on the bank of the Irtish River at his Siberian prison before getting to his morning's work. He hears singing and sees the tents of nomads across the river and is struck by the freedom they have. These nomads had to have been Kazakhs in Dostoyevsky's mind based on his experience. It is just after seeing this that his spirit is transformed. I don't think this juxtaposition is an accident."
"2125",2124,"Emil Johansson","One of my absolute favorite novels of all time (although, considering its length, ""tome"" seems a more fitting description), Crime and Punishment is the story of the young student Raskolnikov, and his descent into madness after the murder of a pawnbroker, to whom he's been forced to sell his beloved possessions. A story of guilt, anxiety and madness, this is NOT a 'light' or 'fun' read. Moreover, every character(yes, literally EVERY character, not just the protagonist) has several names that they switch between throughout the story depending on the situation they find themselves in. In summary: Crime and Punishment is not an easy read. Not at all. But if you ever find enough time to truly give it a shot, I highly recommend this book."
"2126",2125,"Caroline Gordon","If I had to make a list of books that got under my skin, this would be number one, way above anything else. Do I want to write this..the idea of murder and that you may get carried away with that idea and actually do it is one that really got to me. The interrogation scenes often play out in different variations in my dreams. Unforgettable."
"2127",2126,"Lisa Cook","I've come to the conclusion that I just must love everything that's even been written by Russains. Crime and Punishment is thoroughly engrossing and I was held captive by every second of it. In retrospect, I wish I had bought a better translation, but still, this novel is good."
"2128",2127,"Rosa Lee Mullins","This is a story that every person should read and be familiar with. Not all stories are written from the view of the ""killer,"" the person most people come to think of as the antagonist. While the story is shown through the perspective of the killer, he is portrayed not as the antagonist but as the protagonist. The idea that the punishment received for a crime comes mostly from within oneself is an idea that I find interesting, and the writer develops the story through extensive use of setting and characterization, having particular characters act the way they do because of the environment that they live in, paralleling the idea that ""we are what we live in."" "
"2129",2128,"Jen Herr","""The novels of Dostoevsky are seething whirlpools, gyrating sandstorms, waterspouts which hiss and boil and suck us in. They are composed purely and wholly of the stuff of the soul. Against our wills we are drawn in, whirled round, blinded, suffocated, and at the same time filled with a giddy rapture. Out of Shakespeare there is no more excited reading."" - Virginia Woolf"
"2130",2129,"Kevin Movius","Dostoevsky seemed to be more honest than most of us in the struggle we all have between doing what we should and what we end up doing.

"2131",2130,"Alessia Simoni","Ho finito di leggere a giugno. Ho rimuginato tutta l'estate su cosa dire, perchè credo che questo sia uno di quei romanzi che ti lasciano senza parole, uno di quelli che puoi anche rileggerli per sempre e trovarci sempre qualcosa di nuovo. Io non ho nulla da dire su questo romanzo per il semplice fatto che il romanzo parla da solo a chi legge. Ci provo lo stesso.Protagonista è Raskolnikov, giovane ex-studente disagiato che per provare una sua personale teoria sugli uomini decide di uccidere una vecchia usuraia, presso cui egli stesso ha già impegnato degli oggetti. Il testo presenta il giovane mentre si accinge al delitto e poi tutta il percorso di castigo: non tanto il castigo effettivo dei lavori forzati in Siberia, ma quello personale che pungola continuamente il protagonista, diventando una vera e propria malattia psicosomatica. In seguito al delitto, infatti (duplice, non per volontà del giovane), Raskolnikov inizia a non sentirsi fisicamente bene, ha più volte la febbre e l'idea di non farsi scoprire e non lasciare tracce lo ossessiona. In questo si vede tutta la grandezza di questo autore, perchè se anche gli altri personaggi sono ben tratteggiati e caratterizzati e hanno tutti un ruolo ben preciso nell'intera vicenda, è l'animo del protagonista ad essere sondato in maniera incredibile. Persino nei sogni, e nei pensieri sconnessi, e nelle sensazioni fisiche che attraversano il giovane dall'inizio alla fine, da prima del delitto, al durante, al dopo, quando è tutto un gioco di dissimulazioni e finzioni e contraddizioni con la polizia e in particolare Petrovic.Se l'analisi dello stato interiore del protagonista è di per sè un gioiello e vale da sola la lettura, vedere quest'analisi nel rapporto con gli altri personaggi e nella descrizione stessa delle altre persone che girano intorno a Raskolnikov rende il quadro completo e fa di tutto questo un capolavoro vero e proprio. Ognuno, come dicevo, ha un ruolo ben preciso, e la sua rappresentazione può anche essere vista come una critica più o meno nascosta alla società russa del tempo; ognuno ha un tratto che lo caratterizza e che lo mette in contrapposizione agli altri, facendone risplendere le luci o risaltare le ombre e riuscendo in questo modo a far comprendere al lettore le caratteristiche degli uni e degli altri proprio attraverso la loro interazione.Io credo che si potrebbe parlare di tutto questo per giorni e ancora non si sarebbe riusciti a dire tutto. Credo che questo sia uno di quei romanzi che parlarne non serve, devi leggerlo per capirlo. E' lungo. E' un po' lento, e a tratti non capisci il perchè di quella scena ma poi torna tutto, alla fine. E finisce che lo hai divorato in molto meno tempo di quel che credevi necessario, con la voglia di rileggerlo perchè sai che ti è sfuggito qualcosa, è troppo immenso per averlo compreso tutto e subito.Provate, ne vale la pena sul serio."

And boy did it deliver. Terribly gripping and from the moment you open the book it lays a claim on your thoughts and mood. I would not go as far as to say that reading it is a form of self-torturing, but you do have to consider your dosage. About halfway through I almost put it away out of self preservation. Haven't been having the best of times myself lately and it felt like I wasn't doing the cause any good. Especially because while reading you get the ominous sensation that there's not going to be any light at the end of the tunnel. But the fact that it can do this to you through mere printed text alone makes it worth reading. But aside from that it is also beautifully written and not even as haughty as I expected it to be. Just very vivid and empathic.Absolute must read."

"2139",2138,"Ensiform","This edition is hailed as the best translation ever, and the two have done many other Dostoevsky works. There was also a very perspicuous introduction by Pevear which analyzed some of the more vague passages, and the whole was annotated, all of which helped my understanding immensely. Just one minor example: knowing that Raskolnikov is named after ""raskolnik,"" meaning schismatic, sheds quite a bit of light of Dostoevsky's intention in laying out his character. I would have to say that the novel is one of the best I've ever read. I began it many months ago, with long breaks between beginning and finishing it, which is probably not the best way to read such a complex book, but there it is. The novel has at least three plots and many levels of meaning. It doesn't just deal with a murder and a detective's psychological intimidation of Raskolnikov: Dostoevsky's characters offer opinions on the issues of the day, they embrace ideologies that were in vogue at the time, parodying them simply by the nature of their own personas; there are romances; other deaths; two methodical, selfish villains; symbolism through dream and vision; and so on. The author laughs at reason, nature and law. Reason fails Raskolnikov and doesn't help Porfiry, the detective. Everyone makes his own plan, carves out his own existence and scoffs at precedent. This existentialism is not certain; it helps Porfiry, but fails Raskolnikov, and drives Svidrigailov, the lecher who attempts to conquer Roskolnikov's sister, to suicide. A great, towering, multi-layered book, one that I will have to read again in the future."

"2142",2141,"Timothy","When an artist’s work stands the test of time, it is worth asking why. So, although there many ways to review Crime and Punishment (it’s style, structure, characters), I will limit myself to brief commentary on the “deeper messages” in the novel. Even here, one could think about the novel forever, and make all sorts of connections with other thinkers. The fact that there is so much that could be said is what makes the book interesting. When a work is consistently read for over a century, there is a reflexive tendency to say that the work is “transcendent”; that it captures something about the human condition that cuts across place, time, and culture. In reality, this reflex is probably only partly true. The artist’s personality and socioeconomic status, as well as broader sociological factors, likely also play a role in determining what is remembered and what is forgotten. But, in Crime and Punishment, reflexive “transcendence” seems to ring truer than usual. I say this partly because of Dostoevsky’s biographical history. Poverty, prison, near political execution, epilepsy. A man who faced considerable obstacles, although he seemed to be passionate and driven. Moreover, the work is (arguably, the conclusion of the novel notwithstanding) critical of Christianity and key characters are less than sympathetic (as is the case in much of Dostoevsky’s work). Basically, it is hard to imagine that the book’s message resonated with most 19th century Russians. Yet, the book lasted. There must be something “deeper.” Certainly, Crime and Punishment addresses personal morality. What makes a person immoral? If someone is immoral, then what can they do to redeem themselves? These questions play out in the novel largely through Raskolnikov’s introspections and unpredictable behaviors. An important idea presented at several points in the novel is the “superman” thesis, introduced through second-hand description of an intellectual article written by Raskolnikov. By this argument, there are persons who, by virtue of their greatness, transcend good and evil; they stand aloft from conventional morality. It is partly aspirations of greatness that leads Raskolnikov to kill. I found myself wondering about the historical antecedents and consequents of this idea. I know Nietsche wrote of an “ubermensch”. I will have to revisit Nietzsche. Also, in a case of “life imitates art”, there is the Leopold and Loeb murder case in Chicago, in which two affluent youth premeditatively kill a young boy on philosophical grounds similar to Raskolnikov’s. At least three films were made about this murder case, including a Hitchcock film. "

If all literature revolves about the sublimacy of humanity, Fyodor's revolves about humanity as an incarnation of divinity. For Fyodor, no humanity is even possible without God.

The way Dostoyevsky shows you the emotional states of his characters is unbelievably beautiful and there is no one in the world who did it better than him. It was like as if I was with Raskolnikov, who left me speechless and breathless many times, watching him from somewhere very close, seeing the way he struggles, sharing the feeling of somebody having done something so bad that he can’t talk to anybody. Everytime I think about that book I can’t stop thinking about how I enjoyed being inside the dark depths of his mind. The character development in this novel is truly amazing. This book is a masterpiece. It was the reason I started reading all of Dostoyevsky's books and it was one of those rare books that ended up making such a big impression on me.

Instead, I was fascinated by it--so fascinated I did little else that week except sit on the floor, listening intently. This year I finally read the novel with the same measure of awe as when I listened to that first tape ten years back. Crime and Punishment is for me the most compelling psychological fiction I have ever read. The P&V version is highly accessible and highly recommended. "
"2155",2154,"Bhaskar Sunkara","Just finished it. It's a classic text and the translation of this edition was perfect. All the characters were captivating, but the whole message this Russian bastard is trying to shove down the reader's throat is profoundly reactionary. It's basically a healthy attack on dangerous of rationalism and everything else the Enlightenment has bestowed upon human civilization. Among the greatest works of literature ever, regardless. "
"2156",2155,"Gregg","Never studied it formally, whipped through it in a frenzy. Ate it up. Circularity; polemicism (?), rich symbolism and fascinating characterization. Need to wallow in it once more, if for no other reason than to watch the cat-and-mouse between Raskolnikov and Petrovich. (See how I still remember their names? Doesn't that say something about my erudition? No, not remotely.)"
"2157",2156,"Henning Hj","Brilliant book that can be read in so many ways, crime novel, psychological drama, history and more. "
"2158",2157,"Lloyd Scott","Simply one of the greatest novels ever written. If you ever want to begin reading something by Dostoevsky this is the place to start. The translation is good, it is easy to read and to follow unlike some of the others that are involved and have a lot of dialogue and difficult to follow sometimes like 'The Idiot' and 'The Possessed.' Talk about a cat and mouse game and psychology this is the story that you must read, you must buy and add it to your collection this is simply one of the best novels ever written. The Russian film version holds true to the novel also."

The twists and the way the characters acted was great; a little theatrical like a Shakespearian play but nonetheless great! I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy a fiction with great detail and interesting philosophical and psychological scenarios. "

"2162",2161,"J. Clayton Rogers","I wish I could say ""just read it"" and magically plop this book into readers' hands. I guess everything that can be said has been said about it--except, at the end, if you read it closely, it's quite sinister."
"2163",2162,"Gizella Tóth","Szeretem Dosztojevszkijt, szeretem ezt a könyvet, mégis még csak harmadszor vettem a kezembe: először, mert kötelező volt; másodszor, mert felizgatta a fantáziám egy kabarétréfa, ahol kedvenc Colombo hadnagyommal közölték, hogy őt is csak lopták, méghozzá a Bűn és bűnhődésből. Muszáj volt ellenőriznem. S harmadszor most, két kihívás kedvéért is. Nem az a könnyű kis olvasmány, amit reggeli közben kézbe vesz az ember, és ebéd, de legkésőbb vacsora végén le is tesz. Ezen a könyvön nem lehet átszaladni, ezt olvasni kell, elmerülni benne, megkönnyezni, szó szerint cseppenként ízlelgetni."
"2164",2163,"Tso William","Crime and Punishment is a misplaced title. It gives a false impression that Dostoyevsky divided the story into two halves for crime and punishment. The crime, that is the murder of an old pawn lady, was swiftly but unceremonially executed in Part 1, with the remaining parts devoted to spiritual self-tormenting of Raskolnikov, the murderer and the protagonist of the story. Two subplots revolve around the murder. Before he finally decided to carry out the murder, he met Marmeladov, a drunkard who wasted himself away and ruined his family by his alcoholism. To support his drinking, he stole everything in the household, including Katerina Ivanovna, his wife,'s last savings for their starving children, and passively encouraged his daughter, Sonya, to go for prostitution. Family tragedy ensued. The second subplot centres on Raskolnikov's family who recently arrived from countryside to St. Petersburg. Dunya, Raskolnikov's sister, was engaged to Luzhin, a moderately wealthy man whose dream, by the way, was to marry a destitute woman in order to control her and to have someone to idolize him. Simultaneously Svidrigailov, the wealthy gentry with an infamous reputation, also arrived to St. Petersburg with an evil design for the beautiful Dunya.Raskolnikov fantasized himself as Napoleon - a superman who is above the ordinary mankind. His murder was the first step of his greatness because he can snatch the money for a yet greater cause. He could also prove himself as being an extraordinary human. He is destined to fall because a true Napoleon would not theorize so much. He would have simply committed the deed and gone on his way. Svidrigailov is a more interesting character. Like Luzhin, he pursued Dunya but with more thought and better skills. It was rumored that he killed his own wife but it was certain that he lured many a young girl and then deserted them. He almost succeeded when he entrapped Dunya but he gave up at the last second. Unlike Raskolnikov, Svidrigailov is a man of action. All the characters came under the sick influence of the Dickensian St. Petersburg. Neither the Winter Palace nor the grand avenues of the Nevsky Prospekt were mentioned. What Dostoyevsky described minutely instead was the dirty tenements or narrow pavements. The people were the drunkards, peasants and vagabonds. The grand and classical St. Petersburg became a morbid industrial place that exercised an evil influence on all the characters. Dostoyevsky brilliantly portrayed a vast array of characters. We have the deranged Raskolnikov, innocent Sonya, noble Dunya, devoted Pulcheria Alexandrovna, passionate Razumikhin, hypocritical Luzhin, evil Svidrigailov and dignified Katerina Ivanovna. They have their own features but did not fail to retain their human dimensions. Dostoyevsky, however, relied too much on chance and as a result, the story quickly became melodramatic. By chance Luzhin lived beside the Marmeladov family, so that he can play his trick. It was also a coincidence that Svidrigailov lived right beside Sonya and could therefore eavesdrop the conversations between her and Raskolnikov. Eavesdropping itself is a cheap device that is much seen in nowadays soap drama. I also found the didactic style of writing artistically flawed. Dostoyevsky has already shown his characters brilliantly. There is no more point in spending long passages in describing their psychology. The whole book could be cut down a third without them. Crime and Punishment is a huge book and I am glad I have read it. It was a painful exercise because reading a thick book is to develop a deep relationship with the characters. The intensity of the whole enterprise left me in exhaustion and I better read some non-fictions to calm down. "
"2165",2164,"Veronica","The book makes the reader deeply understand Dostoyevsky's greatness not because it is his best work, but because it isn't. It isn't his best work and yet its greatness goes beyond imagination. The deep understanding that the author has of the human mind and emotions overflows from the lines of ""Crime and Punishment"". Darker than other works by him, the rhythm and story line are highly intense and sometimes overwhelming. The human capability of self-torture is described in such a precise manner that it sometimes is disturbing. In this regard, I often found myself comparing the bursting feelings to those I felt reading Kafka's ""The Process"". The description of fear and, mostly, of the human tendency to succumb to it is equally strong. The obsession is transferred from the character to the reader, it's almost painful. The only other work which I found describes the obsession created by fear as well as ""Crime and Punishment"" does is ""Angst"" by Zweig, even though the settings are completely different.Dostoyevsky in this book presents a very interesting take on the matter of right and wrong, on the real meaning of them and the frivolousness of their definitions given by laws or habits, instead of being taken directly from the purity of loving and caring feelings. "
"2166",2165,"Vicki","This is one of my summer re-reads for this year. Every year in the summer I re read something. This summer it will be three books from Russian authors that I read years ago. So far Dostoevsky is as great a writer (still) as I remembered him.RE READfinished this the second time. I agree with my first reading from back in college. It is quite an eye opener, and different scenes from it spring to mind at random moments."
"2167",2166,"Lukas","A very philosophical and deep book. The characters are more symbolical but yet believable. The book starts of a little slow but after getting used to Dostoyevsky's style and the suspension starts to rise it is a very enjoyable and at times even mind-blowing read."
"2168",2167,"Trevor","This is and forever will be a classic--and it's easy to see why. The philosophies are profound, the writing is masterful, and the story itself is tense and so psychologically real that it frightened me sometimes. This is one of those classics that gets people hooked on classics.Another good thing about this book is that it's fairly accessible. The Brothers Karamazov is much more ambitious than this book and a little harder to dig into, so this is a good place to start if you're looking into the Russian classics."
"2169",2168,"Bethany","Excellent book. The main character is constantly tied up in his own thoughts about what is right and wrong, and yet living life as though - no matter what his conclusion is upon any given action - thats life. Easier read than I anticipated, but would read again for sure."
"2170",2169,"Shereen Aldaimalani","Let me say this first: if the main character had been anybody but Raskolnikov, the book would have fallen short. I am either a really horrible person or a very non-judgmental one, because I found him to be one of the greatest characters I have ever encountered in all my years of reading. Not once did I feel repulsed by him - all of that repulsion was saved for characters such as Luzhin and Svidrigailov. But, I suppose, the fact that I felt such deep affection for Raskolnikov speaks volumes about this novel. It challenges you in that it makes you think about what really makes a man a murderer. It also forces you to question whether or not guilt-induced suffering is punishment enough for a murder. If anything, you should pick up this book if only to read the scene where Raskolnikov asks, ""Mama, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, whatever they tell you about me, will you still love me as you do now?"" That line alone made the book for me - it instantly helped me to get a firm hold on Raskolnikov's character and I was finally one hundred percent convinced that Raskolnikov isn't a murderer at all - he's just a man who happened to kill somebody. And, as this novel helps you to realize, those two things are not the same at all."
"2171",2170,"Kristen Sisaithong","I loved this book for it's look into the deep intentions of humans. What makes us good or what makes us bad? More importantly, it always made me wonder whether we really can change our inner selves -- whether our actions are a product of our intentions or our intentions are a product of our actions?"
"2172",2171,"Yona","It took me a while to finish it, but it was worth it.  I'm not sure I understood it fully, but i enjoyed reading it. "
"2173",2172,"Ana","My copy of Crime and Punishment honestly looks like it's been through a war, I have read it so often. There are only a few books that I can claim completely changed the way I thought, and this is definitely one of those. This is the first Dostoyevsky novel I ever read, and it has stayed my favorite (sorry Brothers Karamazov). "
"2174",2173,"Amit Gupta","This is a masterpiece :)"
"2175",2174,"Sarah ","Oh, Rasky!!!!!!!! You idiot. Spoilers ahead: --Damn! I felt Raskolnikov's anxiety. I resented his mother when he did and I loved her when he did. I felt sick at the thought of Luzhin or Svidrigailov getting their hooks in dear Dunya (shout out to Dunya!) I wanted Porfiry to just accuse him, already! I guess I'm saying that Dostoevsky managed to make a very real character that I believed enough to mentally and physically align myself with while reading. This is what ultimately kept me turning the pages. --I find it a miracle that I liked Raskolnikov. His personality--at least that suggested in the character's essay On Crime--isn't one that I tend to sympathize with. The scholar who thinks he's a super-human and therefore above or aside from others is someone who I want to punch in the nuts, normally. A complete lack of humility is not sexy. I liked him, anyway. I think we weren't seeing him at his finest, and the way that Dunya and his mother and that swell chap Razumikhin loved him suggested so. --What was up with Sonya? Why was she so good? Why did she love him and follow him to Siberia? DANG! I've always had a soft spot for the wounded and/or pathetic men of the world, so I'm familiar with this theme, but still. But still. STILL, goodreaders! How could Sonya be that good? --Speaking of o_O, what was up with all the madness and dizziness and delirium in this book?! I've known people in pretty distressing situations and tragic despair...and they didn't immediately get a fever. Was there some sort of Russian virus that lay dormant until stress levels rose? There must've been because it sent Raskol into delirium where he shouted out murder clues in his sleep, killed Katerina Ivanovna (though, to be fair, she was dying, anyway), caused Dunya to betray her brother to her mother while sleeping (""She was raving!"") and then finally killed his poor mother after a few years of being batshit. O_o? --I find Dostoevsky's personal story, weaved in with Raskolnikov's, to be very interesting, and I appreciated the translator's endnotes that helped me piece these together. I would like to read more about him before reading ""Notes from Underground."" --My favorite moment was when he was serving hard time and realized he loved Sonya. Maybe this makes me a sap, but it was such a relief to know that he could feel, again. The other prisoners hated him less after that, which makes all the sense in the world."
"2176",2175,"Ann","We were talking about getting into arguments with teachers over lunch the other day and it reminded me of Crime and Punishment, which I read in college. I loved the novel, but I hated the epilogue where he suddenly finds religion in a totally inplausible and out-of-character way. I made the thesis of my paper that the epilogue was tacked on to placate religious-types and shouldn't be considered part of the original work. My very devout professor did not agree. "
"2177",2176,"☽ Moon Rose ☯"," I never thought that I am going to fall in love with this book and its writer. I first read it when I was younger and never really understood Dostoevsky's words at that time...I think I just shrugged my shoulders, put down the book and eventually returned it to the school library the next day. Years after, with so many books that came my way, I completely forgot everything about it. Until one day, the book found me again....at the bookstore, while checking out materials that I can read, My eyes accidentally caught a trade copy on bargain by a new translators, Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. I tried to recall its plot but I guess my mind simply removed it from my mind literally after reading it years ago. I thought about it...and I thought about it more....I cant decide whether to purchase it or not. I roamed around the other shelves for a long time and decided that if I cant find any other book to buy, I was to buy it and so it happened, I bought the book and carried with me, thinking if I made a good purchase. The book remained in my shelf for days, I totally ignored it and was not excited to bury myself into Dostoevsky's words. One sleepless night, lost in my own thoughts, with nothing else to do or read, I remember the book and took it out of the shelf. The moment I decided to read it, I simply didnt put it down anymore. Dostoevsky left me spellbound. I totally lost myself into his words. His philosophies seemed to trigger something in my heart that were not there before. Somehow from his words, I understood something about life and our connection to the Divine, about destiny and the roles we were required to play, about eternal understanding and forgiveness to know and accept all. His thought provoking analysis, mind gripping scenes and characters that seemed to leap out of the pages blended so well together that I considered myself fortunate to have seen a glimpse of his genius. The book has altered my life. Its influence is so great that it instilled in me wisdom that is beyond this world. It changes the way I see LIFE, things, people around me. It even reunited me with God. I can thereby say that the book found me, just at the right time when I needed a change in my own life."

"2181",2180,"Mohit Kumar","this book is not about the thrill and suspense of a murder instead it's about what goes through the mind of a person when he commits a crime. the story is about roskolnikov who drops out of college because of financial instability, after that an idea grows into his mind regarding how some people are exceptional and the laws made by us are not applicable to them, they are a separate class of people and are allowed to commit a small crime because they are doing good on a much broader scale and giving something magnificent to the society and this idea leads to a cruel murder of a prawn broker and her daughter and what follows is an epic book on psychology of a criminal."
"2182",2181,"Saquib","Crime and Punishment is sweet. It is the first book I read where I see so much more symbolism than any review or person has described. It makes me feel as if Dostoevsky sent a message that nobody could understand, but me... This book showed to me the power of irony in the art of tear upppage. the book RIPS apart nihilism and ""Übermensch"" to pieces. As Tolstoy said, ""Nietzsche was stupid and abnormal"". Tolstoy had The Brother's Karamazov on his deathbed on his death. If you like any of the crazy Russians, hit up the other one too! different styles, both solid choicesIt makes me wanna go to Russia with a pocket full of rubles and cowpecks, and learn the language. The only quarrel i had was that I'm not sure that the epilogue was umm, appropriate. "
"2183",2182,"Hayley","this is still my favourite book to date. i was floored from beginning to end by dostoyevsky's writing. simply put, this is one of the most brilliant pieces of literature about one of the most gruesome subjects - murder, and its psychological impact on the mind."
"2184",2183,"Mark Robbins","I first read the Constance Garnet translation with the Fritz Eichenberg illustrations.

"2185",2184,"Ävelin","great book that show a accurate picture of Russia in 19th century. Love, aristocracy, womens righs and money problams. all is shown in this book by the great Dostoyevky."
"2186",2185,"Kat","This has been one of my favorite books for over a decade. I go back to certain parts of it over and over again, because I love the amount of detail that Dostoevsky covered when crafting Raskolnikov's neurosis."
"2187",2186,"Deirdre Flynn","On the one hand the book is a very specific description of life in an unstable St Petersburg in the 1860s, post land reform and struggling with the new -isms of the day--socialism, capitalism, nihilism. On the other hand it's a story that anticipates the modern psychological thriller as the main character Raskolnikov suffers a mental breakdown that both causes and is caused by his murder of an old woman and her forgotten sister. The frenetic pace makes it mostly a compelling read, but not always. And the epilogue feels like a wasted addendum."
"2188",2187,"Adam Mozo","awesome..had some relationships great psychological book..can't believe took me this long to read it"
"2189",2188,"Miss T.","""Become a sun, and then everyone will see you.""Crime and Punishment is far too complex for me to be able to say a lot of smart things about it. I've personally got a lot out of it however, and I can highly recommend it. It's by no means an easy read, but I knew that going in, and was not disappointed in the least.Crime and Punishment is a gripping, intelligent, and masterful literary work, and I am very glad I pulled myself together, and gave it a chance."
"2190",2189,"David Sarkies","The psychological torment of a murderer20 September 2014	While the title can be a little misleading, the actual form that the punishment takes in this novel is the psychological effect of the guilty mind. The social punishment that the protagonist, Raskolnikov, undergoes appears only in the epilogue, where he is sentenced to eight years in a penal colony in Siberia, though we are given a glimpse of some of the hardships that he undergoes. However, the true punishment that the novel explores is the unmitigated guilt that dominates Raskolnikov's mind and the physical sickness that results.	I am not sure if I can add anything further to my commentary that Jonathon has not covered in his review but since I have gone to the trouble of reading this, in a word, awesome example of literature, I feel that I should at least make an attempt. In fact, as I glance through some of the other reviews, such as Jason's, I even wonder if anybody can truly write more than a couple of lines (though I have noticed that wikipedia has a pretty decent write up that does a very good job of exploring the themes and motifs of this book).	I read somewhere that the story begins with the perfect crime, however, for some reason, I can never picture an axe murder being a 'perfect crime'. Maybe it has something to do with the modern perception of axe murderers, something that does not necessarily seem to fit our protagonist. While on the outside it seems that the murder of the pawnbroker is, in a way, perfect, one thing Dostoyevsky seems to insinuate is that Raskolnikov could not escape the guilt that had come about because of his actions. Okay, he begins by attempting to justify his actions – sort of a Robin Hood scenario where he kills a rich miser with the intention of distributing her money to the poor, but as it comes out this never happens. In fact the money that he does find (and he doesn't get all that much money from her in the first place) spends the entire novel hidden under a rock. Even then, with the whole idea of a Robin Hood style crime, I sometimes wonder if we, as humans, are ever able to overcome our greed by willingly distributing our ill gotten gains.	Much of the novel involves the investigation of the murder and the detective, Porfiry Petrovich, has a hunch in relation to who the murderer is, though he does not have any solid proof. It is not so much his investigation that is the focus of the novel but rather Raskolnikov's response to the investigation. He knows he is guilty, and this guilt is burning up inside of him, but another aspect is holding him back from confessing: the fear of the social punishment that he must face if he confesses. That is the catch: while he refuses to confess he undergoes a psychological punishment which in and of itself is much greater than any social punishment he can endure. It seems that this psychological aspect even prevents Raskolnikov from killing himself.	It is clear that Dostoyevky's Christianity comes out in this book, especially with the reference to the story of Lazarus. In that story Lazarus dies and Jesus comes along and brings him back from the dead. While Lazarus died simply because he was mortal, Dostoyevsky seems to suggest that we all undergo some form of death, and while we are encased in that death we live in torment. It is only through the redemptive power of Christ that we are able to escape from that torment, as is reflective in the story when Jesus calls Lazarus back from the dead. Rostkolnikov clearly takes the role of Lazarus, and it appears that it is Sonya that is the Christ figure in the novel. Sonya is the first person to whom Roskolnikov confesses, and when he finally confesses to Petrovich and is sentenced to eight years in Siberia, Sonya travels with him as a reflection that Christ will also travel with us once he has released us from our bondage.	Anyway, that is enough of the Christian allusions in the novel because I wanted to explore something else: the idea of the guilty mind. Here Dostoyevsky connects the guilty mind with the act of murder (and a pretty gruesome murder at that) but sometimes I wonder whether he actually understands the reality of the situation. The reason I say that is because there are murderers out there that do not seem to be effected by the guilty mind, and with that I point to individuals such as Charles Manson and Ted Bundy. They seemed to be able to kill people yet feel no guilt with regards to their actions. Yet, on the other hand, we have soldiers who are given an authority to kill by their respective governments yet suffer immense psychological trauma when they attempt to return to civilian life from war. This phenomena is explored not only in Greek literature, such as Heracles Furens but also in a modern literature, such as Achilles in Vietnam (though the second book does draw upon the Illiad).	In speculating on this I do not want to go down the road of the street corner drug dealers, or those who commit property crimes such as frauds or burglaries, because those crimes do not seem to have the same effect on the psyche as a murder (though this is not necessarily always the case because I have known people who have been shoplifters and have been so overwhelmed with guilt that they have confessed to the owner of the shop). Some have suggested that a part of human nature is repulsed at the killing of another human being, which is what I suspect Dostoyevski is exploring here, because it is not so much the theft that is of concern, but the fact that Roskolnikov murdered the owner of the money with an ax.	Anyway, that is probably enough of Dostoyevski for the time being (other than the bookclub on Sunday), though I still intend on reading some of his other works, such as The Gambler, The Brothers Karamazov, The Idiot, and of course Notes from the Underground.

"2191",2190,"Maria Grazia","Cosa dire di questo libro che non sia stato ancora detto? Ovviamente Delitto e castigo è un capolavoro, ovviamente è uno dei libri da leggere assolutamente nella vita, ovviamente ... ovviamente ...Un po' meno ovviamente è un libro estremamente moderno, con la sua analisi profondamente psicanalitica delle ragioni e dei comportamenti di un assassino, delle sue interazioni con gli altri, le sue ragioni e i suoi sconvolgimenti, interiori ed esteriori.Perché Rodia uccide per sentirsi diverso, per entrare a far parte dei superuomini, convinto che l'atto quantitativo dell'omicidio possa trasformarlo qualitativamente.Ma Rodia è solo un bravo ragazzo, esaltato e confuso, sovraeecitato da una sorta di febbre nervosa, e tutti lo sanno, compreso il poliziotto (modernissimo, ci si potrebbe costruire una fiction televisiva come su Montalbano) che lo indurrà a costituirsi.Oltre a Rocia, ci sono infiniti altri personaggi in questo romanzo, uno più interessante dell'altro, con psicologie così complesse che ciascuno potrebbe essere protagonista di una propria storia, ma questa è una recensione, non un romanzo sul romanzo :-) "
"2192",2191,"Ashley","AMAZING. I really enjoyed this book. It's a murder story told from a murderer's point of view. Fascinating investigation of forces that impel a man toward sin, suffering, and grace. Dostoevsky is a superb writer."
"2193",2192,"Zac Cazes","top notch literature, long but consistent"
"2194",2193,"Hope","Wow. I totally understand why this is a classic. He had me from the first page. I was in the process of trying to read War and Peace (and still hope to) but I gave up and grabbed this one. They are both writteen by Russian, right? How different could they be? Anyhow-- glad I did. Would love to talk about it with others who have read it. "
"2195",2194,"Becky","I know the Russian names are hard to keep straight but it's worth it for this classic. Who else but a great writer like Dostoevsky can make you feel empathize with someone(and almost feel like you can justify them!) for committing a brutal murder."

"2200",2199,"Brencis","Literally my favorite book. Read it the first time in sophomore year of high school for class and have since then read it 16 more times.Everything about this book is perfect.I honestly don't know what else to say in the face of such perfection."
"2201",2200,"Tj Wilson","This book is not what I expected it be. It is sad but very comical. In fact, some time it is so sad that it is comical. But it's realism is not marred by cartoonish antics. The writing is operatic but supremely smart and witty. There are monologues upon monologues, but these monologues are page turners, building to wonderful observations upon life, some I most certainly did not believe our present day have in common with Russian society in the 1860s. Most importantly, even though this book is completely popular and is said to be THE book, it is still quite unpredictable as far as plot lines go. And the writing is wonderfully digestible. And even more, what a wonderfully horrible slash smart slash kind slash petty slash stubborn slash generous main character. There is no denying that we all identify with Raskolnikov at one point in the book."
"2202",2201,"António Leitão","One of the most interesting masterpieces of all time... Dostoyevsky takes you to a whole new world and gives a new meaning to ""crime and punishment"", focusing mostly on the psychological dimension of the main character. There's a small part describing a dream the main character has that will just blow your mind. A must read!"
"2203",2202,"Panos Lettas","Μιλώντας για ένα βιβλίο που, προφανώς, δεν χρειάζεται συστάσεις, το μόνο που έχω να πω είναι πως ξεπέρασε κάθε προσδοκία μου. Το φανταζόμουν πολύ καλό αλλά δε θα μπορούσα με τίποτα να φανταστώ αυτό που διάβασα. Εξαιρετικό, Αριστούργημα.-"
"2204",2203,"Marcus","This is an amazing look at the dark side of human nature. The writing is dense and exhausting to get through, but it is by no means meant to be a light read. Raskolnikov in the hands of any other author would have simply come across as crazy. Dostoevsky, however, successfully navigates us through the tormented thoughts of this tragic hero, and in doing so uses him as a window onto the fundamental brokenness of human nature."

"2206",2205,"Lemar","Dostoyevsky presents a provocative situation in which questions, big questions, about right and wrong, evil, love and redemption can be examined. His characters come at these questions from unusual and diverse directions that shake off pre-conceptions. The action and dialogue take the reader on an examination of the human psyche that transcends time and place.Sadly the types of tragedies that occur in this novel also transcend time and place. This gives the novel a timeless aspect. The central question raised in Crime and Punishment is relevant to 21st century America. A political party espouses an economic and social policy that is very similar to that appearing here. The idea that if a driven person or corporation (as our Supreme Court has seen fit to include them) goes after profit and achieves it then laws that encumber, regulate and limit them should be swept aside. The benefits of this taking by force will trickle down to the masses and our conceptions of right and wrong must deviate accordingly in the face of realized wealth. This ideal is revealed in all its frozen, pitiless, merciless lonely reality by Dostoyevsky and we can learn from this. It is through acceptance of our fellow human beings, flawed wretches though they may be, that we can find love and it is in love that we can find the strength to endure and shine a light in the darkness. Oddly, in a twist worthy of 1984 doublespeak, this same party claims kinship with the Christian faith whose very ideal is the exact opposite, saying instead that yes, we are our brother’s keeper. The idea that if an action is profitable then it is de facto not a crime is a line of thinking I could see being argued by a lobbyist to a legislator who hears not so much the argument as the sound of money coming into the campaign fund. This tortuous logic can be trotted out, briefly, if needed then safely harbored behind mounds of cash and establishment frowns, leaving the masses to wonder, “how’s that again?” Another aspect of C&P that makes it feel contemporary is its kinship to a couple of television dramas that approach similar themes in an analogous way. Both the Sopranos and Breaking Bad create situations in which a protagonist decides he can break the law. The question is a compelling one. If someone takes horrible advantage of me and I have the power to retaliate violently, do I do it? If I am in an impossible financial position and I find a way to make money illegally, is that so wrong? This novel delves as far into the psyche of humans grappling with these ethical dilemmas than any movie, show or book I know of. The themes of whether actions that are commonly considered crimes are inherently crimes or not has interesting ramifications. If these perceived crimes are crimes whenever and wherever they are committed that implies the existence of God. Eternal truths about beauty, love, corruption and evil are up for debate and fascinating analysis, great book. "
"2207",2206,"Sandeep","It's one of those books that keeps popping up every now and then on some or the other list recommending you those ‘must read’ classic works. Records state, it came out in 1866. However, even after 148 of publication, the content still reverberates as i put down the book. Inspite of the mammoth 853 pages, the momentum never seemed to ebb from the day i picked it up to the day i finally put it down. The beauty of the book lies in the precise manner in which Fyodor Dostoyevsky manages to touch upon a host of themes, weaving a beautiful story in the process. “Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.” The emotions, the conflicts, the hallucinations, the guilt, the compunction - all bundled into one package. “To go wrong in one's own way is better then to go right in someone else's.” Definitely its worth a recommendation to any book-lover. Its not just a good read, its a great read. "

"2210",2209,"Johnny D","This book is brilliant, the classic novel of all classics, the superlative of superlatives, the . . .It's quite good.Never has psychological torment been rendered onto a page so effectively. Rich in character, philosophy, and texture, this novel is among my all time favourites.Of course, you have to be in the right mindset to appreciate this novel. This ain't no fast-paced John Grisham book of the week and it certainly ain't no happy-go-lucky pie in the sky Pollyanna tale. Raskolnikov's torment is palpable and I, for one, felt the agony he felt page after torturous page.Torturous is not really a word that will make you want to read this novel, so just pretend the adjective I used is pleasurable. If you're a masochist you can pretend I used either word because, after all, it's all the same to you, right?I don't think any novel has ever so thoroughly scourged the revolutionary mindset, the narcissistic belief that one has the moral authority and intellectual superiority to justly slay the unjust. Whether you agree or disagree with the concept of violent revolution, Dostoevksy's presentation provides some sober thoughts on the matter.Sidenote: My favourite character is definitely Porfiry Petrovich. I enjoyed the way he feigned ignorance and played psychological games with Raskolnikov. In fact, Petrovich's character was the partial inspiration for my favourite television detective, Columbo. So, thank you Dostoevsky for inspiring the creation of the greatest television detective of all time.To conclude, this is a novel that is well worth a slow careful read (at least twice). It's also worth a quick cursory read, but I recommend against that."

"2215",2214,"Carmen","A MASTERPIECE. Dostoyevsky´s way to show the suffering and inner torture of Raskolnikov as well as the intricated and entangled nature of human conscience is simply brilliant. The vividness of descriptions sinks the reader in the decadent and rotten atmosphere depicted in the novel."
"2216",2215,"Robin Brennan-schlamp","Why do we erect monuments to the great men of war--when they mostly are taking other men's lands, money or goods. Why isn't it okay for a starving man to take what he needs?Dostoyevsky makes the questions worth asking in Crime and Punishment. Sometimes when I see the wealthy whacky housewives who have 4 nannies and plastic surgery every other day, I wished there was a Raskolnikov (sp?) there to end their misery and maybe help thousands of people just have food and a chance of an education. Sounds brutal...and I hate violence, but love d's premise."

"2218",2217,"Julio","I finished reading this book over the past week.It is without doubt one of the best crafted, well-written novels I have ever read. I don't pretend to know much of anything about Russian culture or history, but I never once felt overwhelmed by the unfamiliar setting of the book. I love the characterisation of Raskolnikov and his growing sense of paranoia and delusion. The translation that I read was superb, with the occasional quirks that suggested I wasn't reading the original script. You could say that the novel has a slow beginning, although I think the build up to the crime itself is no bad thing, and I was hurtling through the pages by the end. There are many scenes along the way that are powerful in isolation - the horse outside the pub stands out in my mind here.Would recommend this book to anyone, and wouldn't want my first GR review to be on anything else!"
"2219",2218,"Kenan","magestic, realism at its finest"
"2220",2219,"Evelyn","From the moment one reads Pride and Prejudice, the name of Elizabeth Bennett is forever impressed upon the memory. She learns and grows, and teaches the reader some important lessons along the way. She is no longer just a character, but a real person whom we love and care for, and sometimes see in ourselves and in others around us. Most of all, she charmed her way into our affections, and there she will forever remain.I want to say the same thing about Rodion Romonovitch Raskolinkov. I want to, but I hesitate to. It is not Rodion’s realism or indelible nature I take issue with, but rather the plain fact that in the general sense of the word, he is a villain.It’s strange that the more we glimpse of a man’s soul; his feelings, his intentions, his personality, his strengths and weaknesses, his ideas, his growth over time; the more we see of all this, the more we grow to like him and in many cases respect him or even love him. I think the majority of people we do not care for or get along with are people we do not truly understand. Fyodor Dostoyevsky allows his readers to get enough of an understanding of Rodion Romonovitch that we really like him. Or at least, we’d really like to. He is, after all, a murderer.The beginning of this book is rather dark, but it doesn’t stay that way throughout. We start out in the midst of Rodion’s preparations for his crime. The crime itself is very unpleasant to read about, but Dostoyevsky doesn’t just write a violent scene for the shock value. The rest of the book follows Rodion and his family, friends, and acquaintances (some of whom are very likable and amusing) and the action never really slows. You’ll be hard-pressed to put the book down. It also, of course, explores Rodion’s anguish in dealing with his crime. As the book progresses, we are slowly allowed to understand more about why Rodion committed the crime in the first place, which, as we are in the hands of a master storyteller, comes only after we have grown, almost against our will, to like Rodion. Needless to say, his reasoning does not exonerate him in any way. But despite all, we do like him, and we want him to learn and grow and to end up truly happy somehow or another. How exactly that could be possible, though, is a bit mind-boggling at first.For a Christian, this book is very powerful, but I don’t want to give the wrong impression. The religion in this book is not overstated. Taking a brief look at the plot points one could hardly say this is a religious book. But about three-quarters of the way through the book, I began to see some significant symbolism, that I don’t think I will entirely understand until I reread it. It is so deftly and intricately woven into the story that it’s not entirely noticeable at first glance. When I reached the end of the book I was at first disappointed, but on allowing the story to sink in, I grew to like the ending more and more. Later that day I found myself close to tears as some of the truths related in the story began to hit home. The love that God has for each and every one of us is astounding, and something we could never, in this life, entirely comprehend. There are certain aspects of life that give us a glimpse, though. Parenthood comes the closest, as many quotes will tell us. The love a parent has for their child, even when that child misbehaves or disappoints, is so powerful that we would do anything for their good. Books such as Crime and Punishment can also give us a perspective on this love as regards people around us. As I look at Rodion as a symbol of a child of God, and I see the roles that human nature and the quiet influence of God (personified by a couple of characters as well as symbols of faith like the scriptures and a cross) play in his life, I gain a fresh understanding of God’s love for us and His willingness to guide us, His willingness to bless us, His willingness to allow us to sometimes go through very difficult circumstances, and His willingness to give us the power of choice even if those choices hurt others or bring upon us horrible consequences. The power of choice can be a difficult subject to wade through, because God is, of course, over all. But if He is, how could He allow Rodion to murder Alyona Ivanovna? Alyona was the victim and of course did not deserve to be killed, but that question could apply just as much to Rodion himself. The punishment definitely fits the monstrosity of his crime. Why would God allow him to do something so horrible? And why does God allow horrible things to happen, especially to those undeserving of it? As Christians, we accept that this life is a school, in which we are constantly being given instruction and tested by circumstance, but in which we are also constantly growing, the extent to which we do so being of our choosing. God has control over all, but He allows us control over ourselves; not our circumstances, or the consequences of our choices, but of our choices alone. He allows all of this in order that we may learn and grow, to become better than we were, more wise, more virtuous, and more like Him. He allows all of this because He loves us and because there is more to life than this life alone.It is through this point of view that we can love and care for Rodion and what he stands for, whether that be ourselves, people around us, or mankind in general, and hope for progression and happiness.The more I ponder on this book, the more I like it. It is one of those books that will never leave you; one of those stories that add some small dimension to the shape of your understanding. This is why I love the classics. I cannot recommend Crime and Punishment enough. Yet another addition for my favorite book list."
"2221",2220,"Julie","Amazing that this journey through emergent psychology, motivation, philosophy, and the schism between a person's rational and emotional minds was written in 1866. You're dragged along with the current of the Raskolnikov's battle with himself. By the way, this is an excellent translation, my daughter says much better than the one she read. "
"2222",2221,"Grace Barry","One of my favorite books of all time. "
"2223",2222,"Spencer Foley","It's incredible how such a simple plot can pull you in and drown you in it's world. I've never encountered such a novel that has put me, as the reader, at the same hysteric and neurotic mindset as the protagonist (Raskolnikov), and made me feel as if I was going through their thoughts, feelings, and processes myself as I experience their reality. When you see the physical book itself, it looks like quite a daunting task to take on, but as Dostoyevsky's flawless prose and hauntingly accurate layers of the human psyche unveil through the story, you cannot help but be sucked into it's world; the pages will begin to flip faster and faster and you won't be able to stop until you find out just where Raskolnikov's fate will lay. Is he at odds with the circumstances surrounding him, or just those within him? The motivations and wit used by both Svidrigailov and Porfiry are unendingly interesting, and you're never quite sure how their meetings with Raskolnikov will turn out. You can almost physically feel Porfiry breathing down your neck with a sly smile as you're reading the parts when he is speaking with Raskolnikov, and you will be battling within your own mind, wondering just what kind of game is Porfiry up to and when will he reveal his true colours. Upon finishing this book, I can honestly say it's earned a place as one of the top 3 books I've ever read. I wasn't expecting it to be so absorbing and easy to read given the time period in which it was written. Most of this is due to Dostoyevsky's genius, but also hugely in part to the translator. The translation I read was done by Jessie Coulson, and I would very much recommend this version (although I haven't read any of the others.) I have done quite a bit of research on translations of many of the Russian greats, and I've learned that you should try to avoid many of the older translation such as Garnett's and McDuff's, as it may alter your experience of the book and lead to a lesser accurate portrayal of the authors intentions. P and V's translations are award winning and quite highly regarded, so definitely check out their versions of Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamozov, Notes from Underground, War and Peace, Anna Karenina, and quite a few others. However, if you come across Jessie Coulson's version of Crime and Punishment, I would say dive in head first and enjoy one of the greatest stories ever written."
"2224",2223,"Invidia","About the translation:I started Crime and Punishment no less than 2 years ago, from the Peaver version. I gave it up after 100-some pages. Why? Here's the first lines from that edition:At the beginning of July, during an extremely hot spell, towards evening, a young man left the closet he rented from tenants in S---y Lane, walked out to the street, and slowly, as if indecisively, headed for the K---n Bridge.And here's Garnett's translation:On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards K. bridge.Taking another random example,From Peaver/Volokhonsky:""Such is my trait! Do you know, do you know, sir, that I even drank up her stockings? Not her shoes sir, for that would somehow resemble the order of things, but her stockings, I drank up her stockings, sir! [...] She has a weak chest and is inclined to consumption and I feel it. Do I not feel it? The more I drink the more I feel it. It is for this drink, that in drinking I may seek compassion and feeling. It is not joy I seek... but sorrow only. I drink, for I wish doubly to suffer!""And Garnett says:""Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very stockings for drink? Not her shoes - that would be more or less in the order of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink! [...] But her chest is weak and she has a tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don't feel it? And the more I drink the more I feel it. That's why I drink too. I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink... I drink so that I may suffer twice as much!""And another from P/V: The dregs, the leavings, were being scraped out! Thus a man will suffer half an hour of mortal fear with a robber, but once the knife is finally at his throat, even fear vanishes.Garnett:The last moment had come, the last drops had to be drained! So a man will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand, yet when the knife is at his throat, he feels no fear.To me, it's pretty clear the P/V lines read more elegant, but when you read this almost pretentious elegance 5 pages in a row (too bad I don't have the inclination to type out that much), you'll see there's less character and more letters in them. Garnett gives it a reality which is not Russian, not criminal or of suspense, but of a real man in a real world with a real fucked-up mind, as it really is in life.I ordered a very nice edition of P/V, and something nudged me to give Garnett a try. I didn't want to waste a lot of money again, so I read Garnett off a stupid e-book, unannotated and everything, googling miserably for the French and German. The P/V is nicely annotated, with a nice introduction, afterword, et al. Yet...--About the actual book:Jesus, Mary and Joseph!Period."

Don't let the rather slow beginning fool you - it initially did the people I've recommended this to, and my advice to you remains the same: read on for the experience of a lifetime.Very few books give the kind of insight Crime And Punishment does into the mind of the anti-protagonist. Raskolnikov is an intellectual man, driven to murder by poverty, and attempts to reconcile this action to his moral compass by rationalising it. All of us have experienced this existential struggle, religious or not, at some point in our lives.

The rest of the novel is all about the consequences of this murder in terms of Raskolnikov's psychology. The novel goes down, deep deep down into the darkness of Raskolnikov's growing insanity. It is at times scary stuff. But in the end the novel is about redemption and Raskolnikov, after going down into the depths of this darkness, see a way clear to come back up into the light. I know someone who said that after reading Crime and Punishment she felt that she could never judge anyone ever again. Part of Dostoyevsky's vision is that in the end we judge ourselves, and the totality of our judgement is so utterly merciless that only perfect honesty, the kind of honesty that is in service to the Truth, can save us."

"2248",2247,"Marie","Shame on me for writing this review with a character list open in another tab, but memorizing Russian names will never be my strong point, besides they might have some slight letter variation in English, and I read it in Spanish (after so long!). Who would have known this would be so brilliant to my eyes? Obviously it's an acclaimed classic, but I hated acclaimed classics before. Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov is a law student that's currently living far away from his mother and sister. They rely on his success to have a better life. As the book starts, we find that he has abandoned the university and falls in moral and material misery, but inside there's one more problem of spiritual decay that makes it possible for him to become a murderer. Out of greed and an egotism that he's reluctant to confess, he manages to kill Alyona Ivanovna, a famous usurer known for her lack of mercy towards her clients.Her sister, Lizaveta, presennces the scene. This makes Raskolnikov lose control over an otherwise planned situation and ends her life too. Subsequently, a sickness described as fever, and paranoia invade the starring character's mind, and he's taken care of by Nastasya Petrovna (a servant) and Dmitri Prokofych Razumikhin (a friend and ex-classmate, who has fallen in poverty, but is a hardworking character instead). Raskolnikov's constant paranoia makes him go around the city, think that everyone knows what he did. In a tavern, he meets Marmeladov, who tells him his story. He's an addict unable to quit the habit that will ruin his family. He's married to Katerina Ivanovna. The couple had widowed from previous marriages, and then united. Both had children from their previous lives. Three daughters and a son. The elder, Sonya, will take care of her sick step mother unitl the very end, when her father's death will make the family's situation even worse.Without going much into essential plot details for those who plan to read how the story develops, I do think that Raskolnikov's efforts to do good, even when he's not confessing his crime, point out the qualities that in the end, will make him capable of repentance.I find the parallel between this and Lazarus' biblical episode very called for. In accesses of insanity, it's how he finds the final peace of mind that makes him assume his crime before the world and pay the consequences. The characer study and development is very well done. The concern for the social changes in his time are clearly seen through the pages of the novel.This is my first time reading Dostoyevsky, and it won't be the last. As inaccurate this might be from a literary standpoint, I cannot help but compare with some other Russian authors that I read, especially Tolstoy being the first that comes to mind. While lacking the long description, his work goes straight to the point and is equally capable of telling diverse stories that join together in the end, and that despite their tragic tone, leave some hope for the future.

"2249",2248,"emma"," OH MEH GOSH IM DONE.Wow, deep breath.I was really really really reluctant to read this. It sounded kinda awful and I was just like oh GREAT. And I was so (like x1000) surprised. It's not like I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I really liked it. There came a point when I couldnt stop reading- it gripped me. There were all the under currents that came together and these amazing moments. And it had a good voice- it read like a modern novel (which shouldnt surprise since I read it for (modern) Lit class) and wasn't hard to understand- yet it is still an amazing work. You really end up loving Rasc. There's no hate for this man, a murderer. I'll probably add to this review in a minute...I need to read this again someday just to study it.Just saying, I am so so so for Sonya+Rascal! ;"
"2250",2249,"Rory Armstrong","Second read. A book and author that has fascinated me since my first reading two years ago. The book is an amazing literary achievement that everyone should bring themselves to read. Especially for male university students / ""Intellectuals"" for its direct challenge to there inner thoughts and ideas. Don't throw the fire of ideas as you might burn the forest. Also a fantastic novel in its own right beyond its ideas. The use of multiple character viewpoints (but mostly the main) in 2.5th perspective makes for a great journey with the characters story and thoughts. Essential reading for all."

"2252",2251,"Katie Stark","The best book I have ever read. Dostoyevsky discusses, in detail, the numerous topics of morals vs. ethics, criminality vs. insanity, family, poverty, and of course the individual, all within a most exciting plot. Everything is so detailed, the emotions are rich, numerous, and thought-out, and the epilogue is perfect."

"2257",2256,"Kathleen Dixon","I'm feeling a little annoyed with myself right now - I had written two paragraphs of a review but then pressed something peculiar and lost it. Mind you, I wasn't anything much. Everything has undoubtedly been said before - what can you do when it's one of the Classics?!Nevertheless, I will say a little. I found the chief protagonist thoroughly unlikeable. Not only is he arrogant and self-centred, but he commits the most appalling crime. I was pleased he suffered so much. And yet I was compelled to continue reading (and although my start and end dates imply I took a long time over it, that was really because I read an e-copy and so it's my public transport reading). This, I daresay, is the brilliance of Dostoyesky. Also, I felt immersed in the time and place, and that made the unpleasantness become almost immaterial.I'm glad I'm reading the books-I-always-should-have."
"2258",2257,"Dominique Dacchille","Truth be told, I put off reading this book because I was intimidated by reading something of Dostoyevsky's. I had wrongly assumed that his writing would be difficult to understand, and the book as a whole tedious to read. Instead, I quickly realized that ""Crime and Punishment"" is one of the easiest books I have ever read, in the sense that the writing style and plot lines alike are clear and understandable. Anybody who finds the idea of Dostoyevsky daunting- ignore that thought- it's wrong!Although Raskolnikov represents certain moral struggles in the most extreme of ways, I believe that his internal struggle of right versus wrong is something that everybody in life must confront. Who sets down acceptable moral principles? Why is it right for some, but not all, to challenge those preconceived ethical boundaries? Although we may not all be ""Napoleon"" and dare defy society for glory, the issues of society and the self found at the center of ""Crime and Punishment"" should at least be contemplated by any person who considers themselves to be broad-minded. "
"2259",2258,"Mandy","I found myself getting lost in the mind of Rodya and being in awe and disgust at the same time. Dostoyevsky created wonderful characters that grew separately and together simultaneously. I dont know how to put the feeling I got from this book into words, but if you have the time and a cheat sheet of characters' names then you should definitely read this book!"
"2260",2259,"Laginestra","Dostoevskij è stato a lungo ""lo"" scrittore, per me pietra di paragone per tutte le letture (in buona compagnia di Franz Kafka, ad essere sinceri). Oggi c'è troppo altro per sventolare alta la bandiera di un solo autore, ma i suoi romanzi, e questo in particolare, toccano cieli (o meglio abissi) tuttora ai limiti della coscienza e della morale. Se i Karamazov rappresentano il culmine di un percorso dell'animo, Delitto e Castigo resta il diamante meglio lavorato, più preciso e sicuro."
"2261",2260,"Jonathan","A classic, of course, and one of my favorites. The character of Raskolnikov, and his move through the agony of guilt is one of the greatest examinations of character in modern literature."
"2262",2261,"Barry Smirnoff","A classic book about the clash of ideas in mid-19th century Russia. The new translation provides a much more informed reading, with modern language and wonderful explanatory notes. The conceptions of European socialism and romanticism come into conflict with its hero's Russian religious conceptions of morality. Raskolnikov is a student who has fallen on hard times in mid-nineteen century St.Petersburg. This is a story about St.Petersburg, its people and environment. The city has the huge disparity between the rich and the much more numerous poor. They live side by side, but come together in their vices: gambling, drinking, and prostitution. The problem is that the battle of idealism and traditionalism does not give comfort to the participants. Raskolnikov is conflicted by these ideas. He feels that his crime can be condoned, but his conscience gives him no comfort. He is a man who tries to do good deeds for his family and friends, but has done something horrible. He is driven to confession, contrition and atonement. This is not an easy book to read, but when finished, you feel that you have accomplished something worthwhile. "
"2263",2262,"Pranav","Yesterday I started reading the book again but I won't be able to do it. The books 'The Brothers Karamazov' and 'The Demons' are far too easy to reread because they are not uniformly and through-out tense and bleak. Crime and Punishment is a novel about the-moment-by-moment reflection of an agitated mind, with its brilliance it grips you and tortures you and in such impossible detail, it can only fill you with awe. This was the first of Dostoyvsky's novels I read, and it was this one which propelled me towards reading almost all of his works, whatever I could find from whatever source. In the end, two other books I mentioned, The Brothers Karamazov and The Demons I liked more than this one. But this was the book, I cannot forget, I read at a time when I could easily associate with Raskolnikov.. I was almost the same age and I had known about poverty, and I also think all these spiritual quests that ran inside Raskolnikov were inside me too. I specifically mean the sense of justice. The gradual way Raskolnikov's mind was built-up for murder.This has not been a review but a personal experience. It just goes to say that an unformed man, with an unformed spiritual consciousness, is more likely to be entirely swept away with Dostoyvsky's works, which happened with me. And I admit reading so much of him over a little time of about one year changed me, shaped me in many ways.Recommended for everyone, for those too who don't read this kind of stuff.. Just to be aware that this kind of books exist too."
"2264",2263,"Mike","There is not much more I can say about this book that hasn't been said by hundreds of people throughout the years. On a personal note, I found this book to be outstanding and can easily see why it is considered one of the classics of literature. The way Dostoevsky gets into the mind of his character is as good writing as I have ever seen. The torment, guilt, hope, wonder, and range of dozens of emotions of the main character really hit home to the reader. I think everyone could connect in some way to the ideas in this story and although it is a slow read that takes some time, I think it is worth it for any avid reader."
"2265",2264,"Ecorall"," defalarca okumuştum bu kitabı. nası vurulduysam artık kitaba, beynin zarar görmiyim diye kitapla ilgili herşeyi sildi heralde. hatırlamaya çalışıyorum, sadece olaylar geliyor aklıma. beni böyle derinden etkileyen neydi? aklıma gelirse dönerim tekrar..."
"2266",2265,"Munisha","This is an amazing book and keen insight into the human mind. Dostoyevsky's portrayal of poverty and how we all look at poverty is enlightening and embarrassing. Dostoyevsky shows that ""poverty is not a vice"" and demonstrates that certain conditions can make even the best of men resort to unimaginable things. Now the saying, people who live in glass houses should not throw stones comes to life and do the ends justify the mean. Who is to judge what is a crime. Does a crime become justifiable as long as the ""criminal"" is successful? That's the question. I think the question got answered by the conscience. What is wrong is wrong and is felt by the core of our souls. The only downside to the novel is that it's hard to keep track of the characters because of the Russian names but that doesn't take away from the story but does slow down the reader. A must read!"
"2267",2266,"Umar Abū bakr","An amazing masterpiece! This book made me think deeply about some ethical dilemmas that humans face every single day and about life through the long moral punishment of Raskolinkov. Furthermore, I was fascinated by Dostoyevsky's control of flow of the events using ideas and thoughts. One of the best novels I have ever read."
"2268",2267,"Kayla","This was a book that I was required to read for a literature class over a year ago. I was not optimistic about it at first, and was really not even wanting to start readint it. However, once I did, I found that it was really interesting and exciting to see what Rodya would do next. The book is emotionally deep and contains many themes and images that reoccur in strange ways. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes crime-related literature, or to anyone wanting to start reading some of the Classics that isn't sure where to start. It was a great introduction to Russian literature for me, and I hope to read more of Dostoevsky's work in the future. "
"2269",2268,"Nicholas Soutter","Honestly, I read it only because I was supposed to in school and never did, and I felt guilty about that.I got two thirds of the way through it, and wasn’t particularly impressed. Dostoyevsky wrote well, certainly, but I couldn’t really tell where the book was going, or why I should care. But at the beginning of the last third the entire book kicked into gear, and the entire first two thirds made sense as a buildup to a fundamental understanding of the main character and his relationship to the crime. I would normally argue that it’s poor writing to work that way, that one needs to hook the audience and keep them going, you don’t ramp it up at the end. But your appreciation of the ENTIRE piece grows as the book nears the end, and it’s well worth the wait.Absolutely Excellent."

"2271",2270,"Matt Thompson","A book only meant to be read when you're ready for it. It's down, dirty, psychological. The plot, however, is one of the most powerful and uplifting I've ever come across. In essence, ""standing across from the executioner, when all hope is lost, only to be born again when the executioner forever stalls."" And then everything from then on is a gift. Personally, I think this book contains the most powerful and passionate words ever written, considering the context of the story: ""They wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes. They were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life. They were renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other."""
"2272",2271,"Korkodus","While being a kid, I was flipping through the pages of an art album listing paintings from Russian Art galleries - heavy, dark, detailed, desolate, despondent, gloomy, dramatic, heart-breaking ... that is how I keep them in my mind and why I got to associate them with Dostoyevsky's portrait for Raskolnikov sitting at the center of a similarly colored story in the St Petersburg's dirty, grey, poor decor (""rar loc unde sufletul omului sa fie supus unor influente mai intunecate, mai brutale si stranii ca la Petersburg"")It is story about a murder (by chance, a double murder), a paradox between a premeditated in planning but surprising in execution (looks a bit like a sleep-walker action), and a punishment: a heavy and tormenting psychological and philosophical one followed, naturally, by the resurrection found by confessing, getting being jailed and serving time in Siberia. Telling enough is the split between the three - 10% - 85% - 5% of the book.The biggest fall is represented by the moment when Raskolnikov understand that he believed is above the normal people and there is no crime in murder if done for a greater goal but he discovers he isn't like that after all - that he is one the of the many. (""Cand imi puneam intrebari, de pilda: daca am dreptul la putere, stiam perfec ca nu am dreptul, prin simplul fapt ca imi puneam intrebarea"")Initially I associated this idea with my favorite philosopher, Nietzsche - after more reading and thinking, I realized first that ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" was published 20 years later but also that this idea was pretty popular in that period of time (plus, a real trial might have been the inspiration source together with his life story).This is a re-read as the first time I went through the pages maybe 15 years ago and even if I got much less of it, I for sure had glued to my mind two crazy cruel pieces: the death of the horse and Raskolnikov's mom's attitude towards his son (""a ta pana la mormant"")""Ticalosul de om se obisnuieste cu toate""""Sunt un om fiindca stiu sa mint""""Oamenii, prin insasi legea firii se impart in doua categorii: in inferiori, materialul uman care serveste la procreare, si in oameni in adevaratul sens al cuvantului, cei care au darul si talentul de a spune in mediul lor un cuvant nou""""Oamenii cu adevarat mari cred ca trebuie sa se simta foarte tristi pe pamant""""Ne reprezentam intotdeauna vesnicia drept ceva ce nu poate fi inteles, ceva urias, imens! Dar de ce trebuie sa fie neaparat imensa? Si daca vesnicia nu este decat o maghernita oarecare?"""
"2273",2272,"Jerome Baladad","Delighted to have finished reading this book, mainly because I learned the author is among the favorites of another favorite of mine. Among other activities I do while on the subway, this book accompanied me as I focused my eyes on its pages for close to a month of reading while in transit. Well, read this for pleasure, and not for anything else. I know some law schools have this a required reading, so they must be taking the whole book seriously. By the way, I admire the translator's work that has been poured on this work.The book's archaic in content and structure (its setting's over a hundred years ago which is very different from the Russia that we hear about nowadays though or see on TV), to say the least, but the story is very modern. Just how that happens, you'll have to find out for yourself. Keep your cool, and don't get intimidated by it, as it's got a very basic storyline: the guilt of an idle, proud young man who murders 2 women, as he expounds of his theory of him being above the law, writing about other ""murderers"" in society who got away with it, and in the end, rediscovers love in all its glory.""I'd venture again to read Dostoevsky's sometime, as soon as I figure out that I'm not missing anything from translation. I just have a feeling it's getting to be too pretentious reading these so-called classics or these books critics and readers are raving about (including Dostoevsky's ""Brothers Karamazov""). Besides, most critics get paid for voicing out their thoughts about these books, whereas I just do reviewing mainly for sharing to interested, curious readers. Also, I just go about reading this type of book (a ""classic"" now but could have considered odd those times) mainly to get a clear feeling of how these writers have thought and figured out to write these works. It's just like learning from the masters, without dealing with their idiosyncrasies that can be distracting to writers like myself. "
"2274",2273,"Sankalp","This novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky is said to be one of the greatest works of Russian literature. To be fair, I picked up in my quest of reading top 100 classics and I wasn't disappointed a bit.The story deals with the mental struggles and inner conflicts faced by a former student, Raskolnikov,overridden by poverty, who commits a double murder and tries to justify his act by a Napoleonic theory but his conscience forces him to confess to his crime. The act brings the protagonist into contact with two other persons-Sonia, a religious girl who herself has endured great suffering and Porfiry, an officer who is a master in using psychological forces in crime investigations. Both these persons compel Raskolnikov in realizing his guilt.The author expertly uses feelings and emotions to create a psychological effect in the book that goes beyond the crime committed. Sometimes,as a reader, you feel to be suffering from the same illness as Raskolnikov's.The book also explores the theme of redemption through suffering where the main character,aided by Sonia's love, finds salvation by working through his suffering.In short, it is an excellent work of fiction which is recommended to all those readers who like reading about man's psychology."
"2275",2274,"Diane Gihring","Big book to tackle...but must read! I love the way Dostoyevsky delves into the mind of Raskolnikov. It is a true psychological case study of what happens to a man under stress and guilt.I can't remember when I first read this book or for what class, but I love it and have taught it in my own World Lit classes. I like to pair it with Alfred Hitchcock's movie Rope. I highly recommend reading the book and then watching the movie. They are the perfect complement to each other because they both contain the idea of a superior man that should be able to do kill a man without consequence.The story is very thick and it does take a while to get used to the various Russian names and all of their nick names, but the plot is very intense and once you get a handle on the names and the characters, it is very compelling.Looking for something meaty and thought-provoking...pick up this book :)"

I think when I read this book again, probably in another 15 years, I will go even deeper into the rabbit hole... :)"
"2278",2277,"Deon Stonehouse","Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostovesky focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished St. Petersburg ex-student who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her money. The murder is also committed to test Raskolnikov’s hypothesis that some people are naturally able to have the right to murder. The main hero justifes his actions by relating himself to Napoleon believing that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose."
"2279",2278,"Yasmin","I have to remind myself that sometimes to be able to read a classic, one needs to do it in one day, more or less. I read this in bits and pieces. Sometimes only a chapter at a time. I found myself groaning at the long introspective musings of Rodion. Then I freaked like the closet philosopher-lover that I am when dealing with the passages on ""ordinary"" and ""extraordinary"" humans.This book is not for the meek, but oh how I loved it. I only wish I'd read it sooner."
"2280",2279,"Michael Hurley","This is the second to be discussed this Summer at the Great Books at Colby ""Judgment"" series. Most 19th century fiction has a certain gothic 19th century feel to it. Crime & Punishment could be a mid-20th centure psychological thriller. Age and experience teaches us that theories of life are best developed through examined living - rather than the youthfull mistake of developing theory in the abstract and then trying to put it into practice. Dostoyevsky has great fun with young intellectuals. The two approaches wonderfully described in the climactic enounter between Raskolikov and Porifry Petrovich in Raskolikov's room. Youth is truly wasted on the young. Anyone concerned with the progress of a young man struggling into adulthood should get this book - particularly to give to the young man in question."
"2281",2280,"Juan Pelayo","Crime and punishment is definitely one of the best books in universal literature, this novel has a rich context, all his characters have a complex psycological insight, also Dostoievsky makes great arguments about the human condition and his concience, this novel is a MUST READ in classical literature."

"2286",2285,"Erin Eom","I know what it is like to isolate yourself completely for an extended period of time, to stay in a small room with not much to eat. But what caused Raskolnikov to separate himself from other ordinary people, that, I would never be able to relate to, as I’m perfectly aware of that I’m one of the ordinary. The motive of his murder was so astonishingly intelligent I was all in excitement and I know I won’t encounter anything as shocking as that for a while. I honestly fell for his argument. It is absurd and shouldn’t and wouldn’t be put in to practice, and the realization of the theory might look exactly like the dream Raskolnikov had about the chaotic state of atrocity. But as he argued, there are only a handful of people who are extraordinarily superior and more often than not their act brings overall peace and prosperity. Raskolnikov should have plotted something of a larger scale. He wasn’t just as superior as he thought. Nonetheless, he made himself clear to me about his theory. What I can’t decide though is that whether I would agree upon the purging based on the Utilitarianism. My heart cheers for it but my cold and calm brain says no.I cannot keep thinking about the possible connection between the murder of the old pawnbroker and the Dostoyevsky’s own death penalty experience. He was sentenced to death because of his studying of Socialism which is a ‘theory’. If that’s the case, Dostoyevsky had a truly magnanimous compassion towards Raskolnikov and the regime. Dostoyevsky dreamed of their renewal in the end. "
"2287",2286,"Helen Barr","I did love this book in the end. It was pretty hard to deal with all the protagonist's anxiety, paranoia, procrastination, denial and self-punisment. But, the Raskolnikov's spiritual change, maturing and paradigm shift is all the more powerful for the fact that it is hard won (like finishing the book was hard won for me!) His revulsion at love, his inability to enjoy life and his self-importance fade and he notices all that is around him in a new way: '...now he could only feel. In place of dialectics life had arrived, and in his consciousness something of a wholly different nature must now work towards fruition', a 'growing aquaintance with a new, hitherto completely unknown reality'. Raskolnikov feels he can justify his crime intellectually, when explaining his actions to his sister he thinks he has just put it to her in the wrong 'aesthetic form'. His publication, written in his uniersity days 'argued that all people -not only the great, but even those who deviate only marginally...who are marginally capable of saying something new, are bound, by their very nature, to be criminals.' Petrovich, the tormentor/teacher/enemy/voice of conscience explains the murderer 'killed because of a theory' in the proud, enthusiastic frustration of youth. His pride, that pushes him to reach into the great, unknowable realm of death sees him lose his sanity, until he is brought back to reality by family, friends and the questions of enemies, admitting fault and accepting his punishment from society. I feel that there is also some truth in Raskolnikov's original idea, it is sometimes important to challenge the norms of society (but not kill anyone!)"
"2288",2287,"Ian Larson","There is no value in giving my opinion on Crime and Punishment. I lack the hubris to tell you what I think of it."
"2289",2288,"Kate","I loved this book and am not sure why I had not read it before. The title really says it all - it's a psychological explanation of crime and punishment and what surprised me was that it was such a page turner. By the end I was hooked! My memory of other Dostoyevesky books was that he was ""hard"" to read. Not the case with this one."
"2290",2289,"Mostafa","fascinating!!"
"2291",2290,"Vidur Kapur","A brilliant book, probably the best one I've ever read. The plot as well as the characters make the book immensely intriguing to read. Outstanding dialogue between Porfiry Petrovich and Raskolnikov."
"2292",2291,"Pedro","Dementia, paranoia, arrogance, fury, murderous impulses. These are side effects that may be experienced while reading this book. Dostoyevsky has a way a uniquely powerful way of understanding and incorporation the human psyche into his story. You will feel what the characters feel. You will think what they think. You are not reding a story, you're reading life. This book is an absolute masterpiece, for once in my life I understand why a book is called ""a classic""."
"2293",2292,"Kata","Dostoyevsky is ideal for both the casual reader and the ardent devotees of Russian classics. Really he is!Dostoyevsky is well recognize as a literary genius. Some devote themselves to studying his works their entire life. In varying degrees of devotion, there are readers who enjoy him in periodic doses. I'm that type of reader. I impose long intervals between digesting Dostoyevsky's novels so as to stretch his works across the length of my literary life. Then there is the casual reader of novels. The person who maybe reads ten books a year. Often these readers are afraid to pick up a Russian novel. But a reader should never doubt their ability to understand or enjoy a book simply based on the clout it carries. A book isn't a challenge, unless you make it one. A book can be enjoyable on the most basic level or a lengthy literary dissection. It is the reader's choice. That's why I feel Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment is a Russian classic for every type of reader.I hesitated to write a review on this book because I feel there should be a solid reason for other Goodreads members to seek out ANOTHER book review for this novel. But maybe this review will appeal to the reader who fears diving into a Russian classic. Crime and Punishment has so many layers that it can enthrall any type of reader. Dostoyevsky wrote for everyone. It is my hope that this review will get one person to take the leap and try a little classic Russian. Read a chapter a night with some vodka. Feel your inner Russian grow strong no matter what type of reader you are.Let's talk about the book now:Raskolnikov is the main character and the plot revolves around his life, his decisions, his acquaintances and family. He is an intelligent man, a former student, who lives in a filthy tiny apartment in St. Petersburg. He is someone who has become extremely down on his luck so to speak. And because of his unfortunate circumstances, his judgment becomes poor and his actions become dangerous.***key plot topic - avoid if necessary***Raskolnikov conceives a plot to murder a woman for minimal monetary gain. Though he conceives the plot as flawless, he ends up murdering not just the one woman he intended, but another. From this point forward in the novel his the poor judgment takes a firm hold of him and madness starts to settle in. He becomes physically sick from the stress and circumstance. ***end plot topic***Raskolnikov living with the secreted knowledge of his actions attempts to justify them. He lectures on humanity and at the same time he is giving reason to his recent behavior. He categorizes mankind by saying there is the first category: men who are conservative and law abiding, they love to be controlled. Then the second category: men who defy the law, they are destroyers, but they cause progress. He theorizes that both types of men are relative and varied, but what Raskolnikov truly contemplates is whether there are men who can and should live above the law (the men of the second category). Do these men have the right to kill others? He speaks of many famous men of the past who he believes were of the second category and that without them transgressing, the world would not have moved forward. In essence, Raskolinkov believes men of the first category are merely ordinary. Those of the second category are extraordinary. He is disillusioned and becomes grandiose while contemplating these two categories of man. Furthermore, Raskolnikov believes firmly that he is of the second category of man. And as his mind runs with these theories, he believes that pain and suffering are always inevitable for a man with a large intelligence and a deep heart. ""The really great men, must, I think, have great sadness."" Raskolinkov is building himself up bigger and bigger while internally he is falling apart living with the secreted knowledge of his actions. He is like a child justifying his behavior when he well knows full well of his transgression. Through the entire novel he carries about this disillusionment of his person. It is infrequent that Raskolnikov totters on along the edges of sanity. After much time has passed, his tottering on the brink of potential sanity, he finally understands that he broke the law. And that even though he is in the second category of man that there are consequences for his actions. He pulls away from his prior grandiosity and states that, ""Of course, in that case many of the benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps."" It is then he falls trepidly into the first category of man. Dostoevsky is a master who can intertwine layers of sociological, psychological and theological matters constantly page after page in every novel. I can understand how this could overwhelm a casual reader but it shouldn't because the reader has the choice to absorb whatever they choose in a Dostoevsky novel. It's like swimming in the ocean. You can choose to stay close to the shoreline or swim far out where the water is deep. It is the reader's choice what to draw and share with others from a novel."
"2294",2293,"Viktor Malafey","Прочитавши лише перші сторінок з 10 я зрозумів, що це шедевр.Як добре, мабуть, що в школі я був розгільдяєм і не прочитав цей твір. Адже в ті часи я б його абсолютно не зрозумів.Коротко: роман потрібно прочитати, але після 23 років мінімум. Твір багатий, потужний, філосовський. Про внутрішню боротьбу.Ну і з подробицями. Коли кіно, або книжка є класні? Коли на початку історії ми маємо одного героя. А в кінці цей герой стає зовсім іншою людиною. Ось оцей процес трансформації і є для мене найцікавішим.Стаття про цей твір на англійській вікіпедії займає 22 вордовських сторінки, зарубіжні критики надзвичайно високо цінять цей твір. В будь якому топі ""100 книжок які треба прочитати"" Злочин і Кара обов'язково буде в першій п'ятірці. Чому? Що ж тут такого?Автор Федір Достоєвський написав цей роман після того, як повністю збанкротував в казино. І щоб якось прогодуватись писав цей твір надсилав частинами в якийсь там літературний журнал. Тому детальні описи бідноти й відчаю змальовані в романі автору знайомі особисто.Сюжет взагалі описувати не буду, його і так всі знають. Головний герой б'ється над головним питанням ""Тварь я дрожащая или право имею..."". Вся боротьба відбувається в середині його голови, і він програє.Теорія Раскольнікова така: Великий цар веде своє військо на бій. Своїм рішенням цар(або якийсь Наполеон чи Сталін) пр рікає на смерть сотні(тисячи, мільйони) людських життів. Але такі люди є великими, саме такі люди творять історію. Змінюють хід речей, змінюють світ на краще. Ну хіба не варті були Ньютнівські закони того, щоб за них померли люди? І ось головний герой вирішує перевірити себе, чи дійсно він може бути великим, чи відноситься він до тієї меньшості, якій дано змінити людство на краще. Отак от може здатись що це якась філософська муть.Многие благодетели человечества, не наследовавшие власти, а сами ее захватившие, должны бы были быть казнены при самых первых своих шагах. Но те люди вынесли свои шаги, и потому они правы, а я не вынес и, стало быть, я не имел права разрешить себе этот шагАле як же це кльово написано! Крім переживань героя над його головним вчинком тут ще описуються стосунки в його сім'ї, дуже життєво все так, хоча твору півторасто років вже.Саме місто Петербург змінює свій стан згідно душевного стану героя, так багато духоти й жовтого кольору(жовті шпалери в кімнта, жовті білетики, жовті вулиці) під час гарячки. І гроза, вода і темна ніч в часи неминучого покарання. Прізвища всіх героїв роману теж мають підтексти і відразу налаштовують на потрібний лад. Меланхолічний герой в бідноті, голоді, духоті й тісноті. А навколо бідняки, повії, нещастя, алкоголіки й біда. І всі рідні намагаються допомогти, витягнути. І все дарма.Надзвичайно мені сподобалось декілька речей: монолог про історію життя п'яниці Мармеладова, аналіз Родіоном листа від матері, остання ніч Сведригайлова і опис того, як Раскольніков ходив містом.Звичайно, що не все я зрозумів до кінця, мабуть ще замолодий. Ось чому так вчинив Сведригайлов вкінці мені взагалі не зрозуміло.А взагалі я знайшов так багато відповідностей з нашого життя, просто диву даюсь. От живе собі алкоголик, нічого в його житті немає, вся сім'я бідує, голодає прямо. А йому все-рівно, він лише горілку п'є. Але як же його люблять, починають за ним дивитись, коли він на роботу все-таки йде. На останні копійки копують йому вершки до кави! А він лише другий день на роботу йде. Ось так ти працюєш зі всіх сил, все тягнеш в сім'ю, а тебе ніхто не цінує. Зате алкоголіків цінують і лілеять за кожний хороший чи навіть нейтральний вчинок. Ну хіба не так?А ще в пам'ять врізалась історія про Дунечку і її 45-річного багатого жениха Лужина(який де це Петро петрович був мені противним, це ж треба так його описати ні разу не назвавши і словом поганим, а він такий противний). Жінка яка натерпілась стільки горя, бідувала була готова на все, заради сім'ї. Але поступила виважено і мудро. Знову ж таки, бо дуже любила свою сім'ю, більше ніж себе. От в наш час хіба є такі дівчата двадцятилітні? Напевно що десь ще є :)Дуже показовою і знаковою є поведінка надзвичайно бідної жінки. Як тільки на неї з неба впали гроші вона в першу чергу намагається всім заявити, що у неї насправді дуже хороші манери, аристократична поведінка й академічне виховання. Тож всі гроші вона витрачає на банкет. Ну кому це треба, цей пил в очі? Троє її напівсиріт не мають що вдіти і голодують, а їй треба всім показати, що вона — особистість. Точно як в наш час, беруть люди кредит на айфон, а позвонити грошей немає. А батьки останні гроші на оплату університету тратять цьому бовдору. Або ще хто постарше вже, то купує собі беушний чорний BMW, а от на бензин чи ще гірше на ремонт грошей вже взагалі немає, бо ж треба займ виплачувати. Ну навіщо цей пил в очі? Виставляння і викаблучування.Але це надзвичайно сильна книга. Я цитат звідти понабрав мабуть десятки.Рекомендую всім дорослим хлопцям.Читав книгу щодня, і постійно було цікаво. Незнаю чому, але потратив на це майже місяць. Мабуть тому, що так помало читаю, а може тому, що смакував кожною сторінкою :)P.S. Мабуть справедливою оцінкою була б 4.5, але треба підтримати вітчизняного виробника, тому вліплю 5 зірочок :)"
"2295",2294,"Magda","I read the book before, but in another language. As much as I loved the book and it fascinated me years back, I found the English translation was at times very stiff and lacking novel-like fluidity and nothing like my first attempt."
"2296",2295,"Cormac","John Henry Newman looked on conscience as the most immediate and personal proof of the existence of God. Dostoevsky, in Crime & Punishment, shows it as the biggest obstacle to holding on to genuine atheism. Like any logical atheist, Raskolnikov thinks there is no higher power which determines good and evil, right and wrong, his own mind being the ultimate arbiter of all such matters. He kills an old pawnbroking woman, not so much for her money as to prove that he is a sort of superman to whom everything is permitted, that he stands above all conventional morality, has the right to do so, and that these convictions will suffice to put down any possible remorse. They don’t.His attempts at self justification slowly succumb to his conscience. In the end Raskolnikov is 'saved' because he lets his conscience win in the battle with his own bad ‘alter ego’ (also mirrored in Svidrigailov, whose motto is, ""the best time is had by those who are best able to deceive themselves""). The argument goes back and forth. His better self insists that there is such a thing as right and wrong, and that wrong is very present in man; man’s trouble being that he ""can get used to anything, the villain!"" And then his worse self pipes back: ""and what if I'm mistaken? What if man - the whole human race in general - isn't really a villain at all? If that's true, it means that all the rest [religion, morality, etc.] is just a load of superstition, just a lot of fears that have been put into people's head, and there are no limits, and that's how it's meant to be”. It’s a long argument and a long process, but in the end his better self wins out. The awareness of his crime almost drives him to despair but he overcomes that temptation too. He tells his sister (who now knows the whole story) that he had thought of suicide but could not bring himself to do it. She says, ""That means you still believe in life; God be praised"".Dostoevsky can’t refrain from a dig at the psychological experts of his (and our?) age. When Raskolnikov confesses and is sent for trial, quite a few ‘intellectuals’ see him as exemplifying ""the latest fashionable theory of temporary insanity"". And they are completely disconcerted when he, in his trial, gives a perfectly rational explanation of the greed and self-centered pride motivating his crime; as for ""what had prompted him to turn himself in, he replied bluntly that it had been genuine remorse. All this was almost indecent""...Crime & Punishment ends not just with the 'conversion' of Raskolnikov, but also with the clear comment by Dostoevsky that the new life his conversion opens up to him will have to be won, and that this will not be easy. Did he have in mind another story - a sequel that was never written? Or was he hinting that this is the story each one of us has to set about writing once we sincerely face our conscience, and keep at the job of throttling our bad alter ego?"
"2297",2296,"Kadence Schermerhorn","This book is truly the best book I have ever read. That being said, it is also the most challenging one to date. Fyodor Dostoyevsky's portrait of the human psyche is simply genius. The thought processes that go through Rodya's mind, you will soon find go through your mind many, many years after reading this book. It is understandable why this is considered one of the best books of all times. Please don't hold yourself back from this one! Your life will never be the same."
"2298",2297,"Xavier Guillaume","I read this book at a very rocky time in my life, when I was 19, and while reading this book my life changed for the worst, but it was something I had to go through for sure. I was so drawn into Raskolnikov's story and his pathology that his dark thoughts started to permeate my own in real life, kind of like what the Ring did to Frodo, this book did to me. I remember walking down the street with so much hatred to mankind; it was a terrible thing. But partly for that reason Crime and Punishment became one of my favorite books. It was because I got so involved with it, it would be hard to part with it or describe it as anything but great. I doubt it would ever have the same effect, and I don't see reading it anytime soon. But one day I'll pick it up again, and what I'll get out of it will be immensely different I'm certain."
"2299",2298,"Dr Nick","I always have a trepidation of approaching work considered as a ""classic"". Not that I would feel any compunction about saying er it's not very good but rather there seems to be too much history around it - particularly in literature. I found this weight appeared more than usual with Dostoevsky's stand out book as it is related to law in the broadest sense, the area of human ""knowledge"" in which I work. But sometimes all your worries are blown away and the term ""classic"" is completely appropriate as in this case. A brilliant novel.One good sign is that the book surprises you in lots of ways. Even having spent the last couple of years reading the novellas/novels of Dostoevsky I still have a picture in my mind of the setting being bleak, dark, wet, cold like Russian winter cold. But this novel is hot - really hot set at the height of summer ""early July, in exceptional heat"" as the first line of the novel puts it. The crime - a double axe murder which even now in these anaesthetised times is a shocking read - takes place in the smelly, cramped heating setting of a St. Petersburg tenement flat.Like most of Dostoevsky's other works to this point it is also unarguably an urban novel . People and cultures are living on top of each other in the city - interacting in lots of chaotic ways. One of the characters is killed by being run over. Again touching on another common theme of Dost the tensions are clear between the strict feudal hierarchy of Tsarist dictatorship and the burgeoning urban life/squalor of Russia's biggest city. Immigration is also a reality with many different nationalities mentioned in particular German landlords. One scene has the accent and lifestyles of Germans living in Russia mocked - a very modern development as nation states interact through people.In the midst of this world a murder happens. It occurs early in the book and we know the perpetrator. Raskolnikov - a drop-out law student living in the archetypal garret room not even a flat. By the end of the work he confesses to the police. And that's about it as far as plot goes (apart some family developments with his sister and his burgeoning relationship with a prostitute Sonya). This is not a who-dunnit or even why -duunit this is an exploration of human psychology, interaction and ideas. This is not a sprawling family saga but a tight, rich exploration of humanity in a very contemporary (for 1866) setting. I cannot really understand the phenomenal success of crime fiction - puzzle solving maybe -but everything that could be strong about a crime novel was covered here by Dostoevsky: the thinking of a killer, the consequences of meaningless violence and the ending of human life. Every crime book or the sub genre (apparently) psychological thriller since then that touches on this pales in comparison in my view.Dostoevsky even creates a bumbling intellectual detective Porfiry who solves the crime early on. His interactions with Raskolnikov are excellent mind games . Porfriry was apparently the model for legendary TV Detective Colombo (and the structure of each show was broadly based on this work too) which you can see. In fact every cliched detective maverick with a brain (which he's not afraid to use!) has some roots in this little man - I'm thinking Cracker with his centre piece interviews/analysis with the criminals or more obscure Frank Pembleton in Homicide Life On the Streets - a forerunner of the Wire.So plot is not really the thing but characters and ideas are. This probably explains why three has been quite a few dramatisations of it - not because of the story but the continuing power of Dostoevsky's creations.Some of the ideas explored are pretty basic - why kill someone? What affect does it have on a killer, any? Although Raskolnikov seems to create a motive - the woman he murders is a ""hag"" and a money lender - he can use the money for a greater good - to re-establish himself as a student (tuition fees were about then!) and help his widowed mother and sister. Yet he ends up killing an ""innocent"" - the hag's half sister and never spends the money which he steals. In a vague echo of Johnny Cash - is he killing her ""just to watch her die"" or to see what will be the impact on him. Well it's not good - Raskolnikov retreats into his shell, but life goes on and his attempt to exist with his actions as the banality of life goes on around him is spellbounding to read.Along with these fundamental questions there is also a lot of nineteenth century ideological debate. Another powerful aspect of this novel is that the discussion of these concepts neither seemss dated nor contrived. Often in fiction when the author is linking the novel with an idea it seems shoe-horned in. For Raskolnikov makes an attempt to intellectually justify the murder of ""lesser"" people - it is discovered that he has written an academic article (which Porfiry has read, obviously). He argues that exceptional people have the right to overcome their conscience as they have a higher and greater aim. Indeed the greatest people in history have introduced new laws and systems which traduce earlier ones thus they are by necessity turning things on their head. Napoleon is a recurring (and for the time current) example. His greatness and plans allowed him to take endless lives. It is still a symptom of psychiatric illness to believe you are the reincarnation of Napoleon or related to it. This is part of Dost's attack on the Nihilists and Early Utopian Socialists - essentially ascribing Raskolnikov with these views. The ends justify the means at one level but it is a bit more than that - the ends almost require these means. Some have seen this as an attack on Marxism but that is very unlikely as Marx's work was only in limited circles by then. But it is an attack on ""modern"" or ""European"" responses to the radically altering world in the nineteenth century. Particularly there are many side swipes at ""What is to be Done"" - the Utopian Socialist Novel.For the problem with Raskolnikov is that even though he may believe the great man can do what he wants philosophical action the double murder he has carried out is impossible for him to bear and maintain his grip on reality. The dichotomy of actions that end in people's deaths - it seems easier to do this when ordered from a distance - like Napoleon or even Tony Blair. Interestingly it is the detective Porfiry who outlines the argument from the article to Raskolonikov in another memorable scene.Again that highlights the strength of the work it is not a dry academic analysis on the impact on human pschye of killing one or two people (although it is partially that) it is a fast paced work with memorable scene after memorable scene. In many ways like a great piece of cinema.There are dark characters found in the grottiest bars in back streets of St Petersburg - one called the Crystal Palace accurately enough. Early in the book he stumbles into a bar-room bore drinking his family's money away. He gives a brilliant monologue outlining the tedium, self indulgence and delusion of all drunks. This is so strong I almost hoped it wouldn't be referred to again - just existing as a stand alone piece. But there is a nod to the 19th Century novel plot and the fallen daughter which the drunk refers to becomes entangled in Raskolnikov's life - Sonya.A true villain Svidrigailov also exists in the piece - although ironically we don't discover if he actually has killed anyone (though the murder of his wife and others is hinted at) where we do know that Raskolnikov did. He is attempting to seduce and pursue Raskolnikov's sister which he almost does in a chilling scene near the end. He also seems to be a peadophile - marrying a 15 year old in his fifties, grooming other children. Again a very modern, nasty dark truth written about by Dostoevsky. Svidirigailov also kills himself which Raskolnikov cannot bring himself to do. The nature of suicide is something which obsessed Dostoevsky. There is so much in this work (in fact it is a book you could get obsessed with in itself). A disturbing scene where Raskolnikov demands Sonya reads Biblical passages to him. The comical uselessness of Luzhkin - a clerk on the make who manages briefly to convince Raskolnikov's sister to become engaged to him. And of course the creation of Porfiry. All of the work is of its time : St Petersburg 1866 - streets, events, people are referred to but also universal.Dostoevsky really found his voice with this book - although he had written some strong pieces as I have outlined on this blog. Literally - this is a third person narrative although it follows Raskolnikov almost through every page: he apparently rejected the version where he was the narrator. There are two exceptions to this - near the end the narrative breaks from Raskolnikov to follow Svidrigailov - ending with his death. Also the Epilogue which has a strange distant tone - it follows Raskolnikov (or the criminal as it calls him) to his prison exile ( a la Dost himself) and his redemption through Sonya's love and (of course for FD) religion. I am not sure about that ending but it follows Dostoevsky's spiritual belief - the truly dark figure kills himself..It is great when ""classics"" live up to expectations and I have not really done it justice. In contemporary writers the balance of the very new with the universal is often attempted but never that successfully. Old Dostoevsky shows how it is done. Amazing."
"2300",2299,"Gina","Love this book. Nobody suffers like a Russian. Makes you question right and wrong and your own moral code."
"2301",2300,"Lawrence","Raskolnikov is a fantastic riddle of a person. For example, I can understand why Raskolnikov murdered (Dostoyevsky does a good job here), but I don't understand why he turned himself in. But the drama of it all held me spellbound. I found myself thinking about Tom Ripley, another essentially unhappy, but definitely unrepentant, murderer who co-opts us into caring about him, just as Raskolnikov does.Otherwise, this is Dostoyevsky at his best. A page-turner with interesting characters (Sonia, R's family, Razumikhin, Svidrigaylov, the odd and intuitive Porfiry Petrovich, etc.) and excellent conversations. Sometimes it is surprisingly antic (e.g., the Marmeladov sections, and especially the funeral meal, and Lebeznyatnikov's blabbing and his nonsensical ideas that are deflated by Luzhin of all people). All these characters motor through this book as strong and absorbing presences in themselves --- such that the reader is jarred when he/she remembers this whole creation rides on top of the basic fact of two murders. What fantastic craftsmanship and art. I suspect that D. put a lot of his own knowledge, based on experience, into this book, but the book is primarily art and not reportage and avoids any temptation to present a program, say, on punishment in contemporary Russia. What a genius.P.s. I found the Magershack translation quite nice. Very readable and ""easy""."
"2302",2301,"Salvador Arellano","Sin duda una de las mejores novelas que existen. Dostoievski tiene la visión psicológica aguda y conoce profundamente el corazón humano. Un libro lleno de filosofía y una visión cristana del mundo. Una novela existencial de situaciones extremas y valores notables"
"2303",2302,"Amy","Was barely at 4 stars by the near-end--dreaded finishing. ""Where can this possibly go?"" I kept asking myself as R was going to give himself up. But the Epilogue--microbes and all--was unexpected, shocked me twice, and overall, was transcendent. "
"2304",2303,"Lydia","A beautifully written story about a student and his decision to murder a loan shark. At times I could not believe the psychological twists and turns of human chess. I began to wonder if this was a feature of Russian nature or mid-nineteenth century thought. Even after 531 pages I am not sure of Raskolnikov's motives. In such a long book, there were plenty of ways to turn the stone over and over and over. Would I torture myself and read The Brothers Karamazov also translated by Pevear? Absolutely, but only with a winter snowstorm raging outside."
"2305",2304,"Suzi","Dostoevsky's greatest work... one of Western Literature's finest and most disturbing novels. It's almost too much to bear, being inside this man's head and experiencing the wretchedness that surrounds him and finally turns him into a murder. There is a scene at the beginning of this book that concerns an old horse and his master with a whip that is horrific and yet beautiful (god knows why, but it is). And the progression of our main character down the road to nihilism and finally that blankness that allows evil to take root. That's what's at the core of this. So much of the book, of this man's thoughts are banal and silly and who gets to live in what apartment and who's upstairs, and where's the this and the food and who is watching me and on and on........ but in the end, what is murder? Who are we as human beings? Just agents of inexorable forces we cannot truly fend off? How much of our natures are controllable. Why do we do what we do? And after, are we redeemable? Is there something special about being a human being, or are we all just ants nipping at each other. Read it. You tell me...... "
"2306",2305,"julieta salazar","Me encanta este libro por el retrato que hace de sus personajes, su psicología y sus motivaciones... la redención de Raskolnikov, su viaje personal y como el amor y la aceptación de Sonia lo van cambiando es una de las historias de amor más hermosas que he leído a pesar de estar enmarcada en un contexto tan oscuro.."
"2307",2306,"Alec","This was an assigned reading in high school, but I really enjoyed it. The story, in which a young man commits a horrible crime in an attempt to prove to himself and the world that he is the theoretical Ubermensch. The events leading up to the deed and his subsequent emotional and moral struggles are fantastically written, and the supporting characters do a wonderful job in leading the main character to the novels conclusion. It's not the easiest of reads, but you'll be happy that you undertook it. "
"2308",2307,"Evi Curu","Didnt expect that a book in 19th century Russia will move so much someone like me that prefers the post modern japanese literature, so I recomend it to everyone nevermind your generel preferations. "
"2309",2308,"Bradford","I didn't realize how much of the book would take place after the crime and before the character's arrest - rather makes me ask whether there is an emphasis on self-indictment, or succumbing to social correction... good book, but i'm left swinging about the ending."
"2310",2309,"Tabish Arif","After having completed this book, I desperately needed a moment to capture my thoughts and ponder over all that was within my mind, but it wasn't possible for a long time due to ridiculous distractions such as a number of inspiring thoughts and ideas incessantly colliding with each other in my head in a rapid frenzy.It is, however, with a sense of immense excitement and accomplishment that I find it within my heart to be able to put into action a futile attempt at describing the pleasure and rapture I had gained in reading this brilliant work of art.The psychological insight into the psyche of 19th-century inhabitants of Russia is just as captivating and thought-provoking as is the magnified look into impoverished lifestyles and notions from that era.I feel it is necessary for me to also list particular instances from the story that had really struck that sentimental chord within me, so please read no further if you haven't read this novel.*spoilers ahead*- What really touched my heart was the fact that the slightest hint of sanity from Raskolnikov was only witnessed when his friend Marmeladov had died, someone he hadn't even known for a long time; and another occasion when he was convinced that he had loved Sonya and could renew his life completely in seven years. These specific moments brought out a different sense of approach to life within him.- Katerina Ivanovna's desire to let the World know that she's from an Aristocratic background was really, really heart-wrenching. What makes her poverty worse is that she had already been familiar with a better lifestyle, and yet she finds it in her heart to continue struggling for her children in dire straights.- Raskolnikov's realization of having failed in followoing his theory due to a ""lack of courage in his convictions""- The palpable strong bond between Raskolnikov and his mother and sister."

"2315",2314,"Dec","An Incredible book and undoubtedly one of my all-time favourite classics. The depth of psychology evoked through Dostoyevsky's characters is startling; at once intimate and wholly realistic. This is a clinical depiction of the human psyche which in my opinion has never been so acute in literature."
"2316",2315,"Chelsea","Everybody already knows this a five-star book, so I won't iterate some flowerly discussion of the plot or the symbolism or the mind-boggling historical affect of Dostoyevsky's works. Instead, here are just a few things I really liked about it:1) I love Sonya, the prostitute with a heart of gold. Forced into a life she does not wish to live so that she can provide for herself and her family. What makes her an extra-great character is that she doesn't exist solely as a symbol for the poverty of the time or of the suppression of women. The character herself is extremely nuanced and very real, and though really a secondary character in the novel she seems stand-out on her own. I couldn't help but love and feel for her the entire time. 2) I like that Dostoyevsky uses his character's dialogue to tell you what the non-speaking conversant is doing. I really enjoy the more seamless movement of the dialogue rather than constantly having the omniscent narrator step in to tell you what is happening to the person off-sceen.3) The way Dostoyevsky makes you hate and then feel sorry for Raskolnikov within the span of two pages is incredibly impressive. The depth of main character is truly unrivaled. I am a big fan of Victor Hugo but his characters always seem to embody the Platonic Ideal of SOMETHING. Raskolnikov is a man, a flesh and blood human who has a lot going on. I like the ""many layers to the onion"" approach, because it really makes the character seem so real.4) The writing! Holy moly. That is all."

I think that either this review or my tears, my rapid-beating heart, my admiration or any word of praise I can think off just isn't ENOUGH to even come close to the greatness of this book. I found comfort in it and I found fear. I cried over it and was left speechless. My dear Dostoyevsky, I salute you with awe from the bottom of my heart that recognized this genius piece of art as the greatest book it came across.""Existence alone had never been enough for him; he had always wanted more. Perhaps it was only from the force of his desires that he had regarded himself as a man to whom more was permitted than to others."""
"2320",2319,"John Parr","I spent the entire miserable hot summer of 1986 reading and re-reading the first 100 pages or so of Crime and Punishment, which essentially details how hot and miserable it is in St. Petersburg in the summer. "
"2321",2320,"Diana","a psychological journey, written so brilliantly by Dostoyevsky that the reader actually feels the tension and paranoia that the main character experiences. A creepy book, but definitely one that the reader can extract a certain sense of having learned or understood something never before experienced."
"2322",2321,"Diane","It's fortuitous that I was reading this book at the same time that we were learning about philosophies in AP European history. This is an amazing books that explores the boundaries between logic and emotions, reason and conscience. Dostoevsky artfully incorporates many ideas of 19th-century Russia and Europe into the different characters in the book. Covering a span of only 2 weeks before the Epilogue, the book captivated me at nearly every moment. It put me on the edge of my comfort zone as I felt sorry for a murderer and tried to explore my own true feelings about the serious issues the characters faced.Oh look, English class and the teacher's love of this book has poisoned me. But really, this deserves to be a classic. :)"
"2323",2322,"Sustained Dissonance","I wouldn't have called the book ""Crime & Punishment"", I would have instead called it ""Love & Compassion"" as this book is absolutely full of such things. I've never been so moved by any work of literature, in my entire life; although to be fair, I haven't read a great deal but I digress. It often felt as though I was the characters themselves - That I was in their shoes and feeling not my own emotions but theirs. And what a rollercoaster of emotions it has been - I've teared up as well as weeped (the epilogue!); I've smiled as well as laughed and everything inbetween. Perhaps that's in part because I related to many of the blessings and plights within on a personal level but that aside - I feel that it's a masterpiece and that seems to be what masterpieces do; no matter how relateable they may or may not be.I feel almost... regretful? As though I have lost something dear to me, merely for having finished the book (although, at least I'll be able to read it again in the future and I most assuredly will). And don't think that I feel unfulfilled in any way because of that feeling, quite the opposite in fact. Not only was it emotionally moving but it was also extremely thought-provoking. To say how relatively short it is (at least, the edition I read) the character and plot development was brilliant, in my eyes. I fell in love with many of the characters, even the ones I disliked or hated. I'm still trying to process it all, to be honest and I probably will be for some time to come. And now, I simply have to read the rest of Dostoyevsky's works and I'd implore you to do the same."
"2324",2323,"Tey","I loved this book from the first page. I read it on spanish and English. And i will read it again some day, probably!!!

"2325",2324,"marquie","One thing that recurred throughout my mind time and time again throughout the time that I was reading the novel was how well, how vividly Doestovsky captures the human mind. He doesn't just simply delve into it. If anything, he delivers it to you. He portrays it in its flesh and blood. And shows you, what it really means to be human. It's simply mindblowing how well Doestovsky knows human nature. And to think that this man, wasn't even a psychologist!! I especially marveled at how he captured Sonia's despair, and how her only form of hope was conceived from that of religion (which is, in actuality - true of many despairing souls out there). This is a novel highly recommended for anyone willing to ponder the meaning of humanity, conscience, or even crime. Or better yet, anyone really who wants to be left speechless by the craft of Doestovsky's genius."

"2330",2329,"Wendy","Of course I found it brilliant but alas I have to confess that I am not a fan of heavy Russian novels. I loved them when I was a teenager but it's taken me a month to read this book."
"2331",2330,"Alla","Brilliant. My only complaint is that it could have been about a hundred pages shorter and the first third of the book is difficult to get through- the lengthy archaic dialogue filled with an endless array of (seemingly) useless digressions and details, the list of (seemingly) insignificant characters, the tedious nature of scattered internal ramblings...But before the halfway point everything starts falling into place and nothing is nearly as superfluous as it seemed. A Truly meaningful study of human nature and the social construct. Crime and Punishment, like 1984, makes you examine questions that can only have unsavory answers. I will definitely come back to Dostoyevsky. "
"2332",2331,"Mehdi Naqvi","A great book on the soul of man or perhaps it's absence.I really liked everything about the book but could not make peace with the favor given to theism(Yes I am an atheist maybe not that liberal ).Through this book Dostoevsky seems to become more than an atheist or theist,he becomes an immortal Genius. "
"2333",2332,"Rick Rapp","This book is a marvel. It takes a very simple incident and weaves a long and complex tale about its implications upon the lives of a those involved. The characters are well-drawn and well-rounded. Dialogue is honest, if lengthy. Reading this book was long overdue for me, and I was rewarded with a most pleasurable journey."
"2334",2333,"Amy Jones","Not my favorite of Dostoyevsky's works -- that honor belongs to The Brothers Karamazov -- but still a fascinating, chilling read that asks questions we all must try to ponder."
"2335",2334,"Alex Rubenstein","If the Brothers Karamazov is (among many other things, to be sure) about a man who did not commit a crime but is tried for it because everyone thinks he did it, Crime and Punishment is coming to grips of the man who did do it but just about everyone thinks he did not. Truly, the crime is a minuscule aspect of the plot, just as the punishment isn't very shown until the very end. The real punishment is psychological: the internal torture of dealing with the reality of one has just done. It's a masterpiece for that reason--the psychological expression of an individual's anguished inner monologue, and the artful way of expressing those thoughts. Here we begin to see one of Dostoyevsky's most distinguishing themes, namely, that what is ultimately good or evil rests not on the external law or popular opinion, but rather on our conscience--that ""the conscience is the sternest judge"". Our punishment for an evil deed is doled out much more in personal suffering than any prison term can one be sentenced to.Aside from the pervasive themes of good/evil, conscience, God's will vs. Man's, Dostoyevsky offers some very interesting theory on the nature of crime and power. Rodya believes that a certain extraordinary sect should be above the law, those people intelligent enough to know that the crimes they commit are for the greater good of society. Of course, Porfiry calls him out on this to wonder what makes someone qualified to hold such a position, and how they themselves can be kept in check. Indeed, ""who will guard the guards?"" It's a very interesting discussion they have, and one of the most intriguing ideas I've read."

"2339",2338,"Alexander Ellis","Really interesting book, lots of great ideas crammed into it. I'm never really sure where Dostoevsky stands on the ideas presented in the book, but his characters and sub-plots are all fascinating. "
"2340",2339,"Ally","The perspective of the novel is one in which I truly enjoyed. It was third person omniscient; there were multiple subplots, yet there was a clear connection to the protagonist, Raskolnikov, who committed a crime and had to personally pay the price. Ultimately guilt was his punishment, and this is evident because the majority of the novel was about his internal struggle. His public punishment only comprised the epilogue of the novel. Dostoyevsky clearly connects to his message to his readers and his country (during the time he wrote this novel people were becoming idealistic and philosophical and extremist) that crime cannot be justified and has worse consequences than beneficial gains."
"2341",2340,"Metatron","Something I have always appreciated and loved very much about Dostoyevsky's novels is the dramatic and radical developments most of his characters have. ""The Brothers Karamazov"" was the first novel I ever read by Dostoyevsky, and I thought ""Crime and Punishment"" would be a good second novel to advance with. I was right!Crime and Punishment is a distressing novel. And it's not a surprise, is it? It's Fyodor Dostoyevsky we're speaking about! The novel has certain moments of joy, of humour, but the rest of the novel is filled with moments of pure greed (Katerina Ivanovna, anyone?), indigence, arrogance and, sometimes, moments that indirectly disclose the terrifying darkness that inhabits man's heart. The plot is basically the following: Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov is a meagre drop-out college student who lives in a tiny garret on an apartment located in St. Petersburg. He is different from most underprivileged people you'd know, though! He dresses with filthy and ragged clothing, but Raskolnivok is a handsome, tall, smart and good looking young man whom is also arrogant and feels he possesses a large sense of entitlement. Raskolnikov despises people; he despises society as it is, he's asocial, antisocial and he attempts to avoid people at all costs. This particular attitude of his reminded me very much of Ivan Karamazov, from ""The Brothers Karamazov"". Ivan was intelligent, cold and distant; much like Raskolnivok. Unlike Ivan, however, Raskolnikov loathes society and people not because of the barbarity and cruelness that abides in the world as Ivan did, Raskolnikov's motives are solely because of his own arrogance, conceitedness and his self-indulged thought of being superior to everyone else. He's arrogant and prepotent, but since he doesn't involve himself with society, he couldn't possibly harm anyone, could he? Wrong. This is where our (indirect) second protagonist comes. This person isn't a protagonist in the sense that we see much of them, that we see them constantly interact or that we're able to know what they think or feel. No, this person is a main protagonist in the sense that because of this person, most of the plot and the novel is a constant roller-coaster of drama, affliction and darkness. This person is an elderly woman named Alyona Ivanovna. Alyona Ivanovna is a pawnbroker who tends to make the miserable more miserable than they already are and to snatch them from the little money they have. She has a thirty five year old sister named Lizaveta whom she (Alyona) has enslaved to clean, cook and do house chores. Alyona is a woman with a repulsive nature; constantly beating up her sister and constantly degrading people and, much like Raskolnikov, has a high sense of self-worth. Raskolnikov utterly loathes her because of her ways, until he has enough. This is where it gets good. When we hate someone, we usually think awful things about them and probably speak behind their backs. But that's about it. Raskolnikov takes the notion of loathing to a whole new level. He doesn't only think awful things about her, and he doesn't speak behind her back; he plots on murdering her. And he does.On a different note, something that I liked very much was the introduction of Marmeladov and his family. I thought that he would be a minor character, but I was wrong. You know how Dostoyevsky is, everything has to be filled with misery and ache. In Chapter II we're introduced to Marmeladov, Katerina Ivanovna, his wife whom married him out of misery because of her being a widow, Katerina's three children and Marmeladov's daughter, Sonya. Throughout the development of the novel, we're able to learn more about this dysfunctional and miserable family. (view spoiler)[ We learn the progress about the sad ending of the ruined Marmeladovs, a family that includes their drunk husband, Marmeladov, trampled to death in the streets, whom is also noble enough to recognise he's the root of his family's problems, but too egoistical to do something about it, a proud, greedy and consumptive mother, Katerina Ivanovna, reduced to constantly beating her three children and begging to the rich; and an older daughter, Marmeladov's daughter, Sonya, whom is forced into prostitution to support her family. Sonya is probably the most loving character of the story besides Dunya, Raskolnikov's sister. Sonya's suffering and devotion to her family stands out remarkably against this backdrop of utter despair. She has long understood and accepted her identity and role, despite the cruel and crushing reality of her life. (hide spoiler)]Ultimately, Raskolnikov and Marmeladov's daughter Sonya, bond and he, since she is damaged and so is he, attempts to compare himself to Sonya, but the difference between them is that Sonya turned to prostitution to help her family, and she truly laments her sin, while Raskolnikov hasn't repented his crime, confessed his crime or lamented his sin. He can't realise that what she's doing is selfless while what he did was solely self-serving. The cause of his murders was unclear for most of the novel, but almost in the end we're able to find out why he did it. To understand we review his Crime article. He explained some men were above and superior to the rest of mankind, therefore they had the right to break moral codes, one of them being the notion of being able to commit murder. Nearly the end of the novel we realise that he murdered Alyona Ivanovna because his self-absorption fuelled his actions. He wished to prove he was somehow extraordinary and so superior he could break moral codes that bind ordinary people. Yet, his development after the murder only proves he is completely pathetic and a sad excuse for a human being. He murderer Alyona Ivanovna because of self-absorption and he murderer Lizaveta because of the mere egoistical purpose of not wanting to get caught. Here we realise how truly selfish and self-serving Raskolnikov really is. He constantly tried to justify his main murder, saying Alyona's life was worthless while his wasn't, so it wasn't worth confessing. He involved himself with society after the murders so he could find faults in society and attempt to justify his main murder. In the beginning, he had a side of him that felt repulsed by the idea or murdering Alyona, yet the other side of him begged for it until he finally did it. All I was able to conclude about Raskolnikov was that he was a major coward. In general, the novel is filled with distress and much pain, but in the end, Raskolnikov falls in so much love with Sonya that he confesses his murders to her, and she supports him and urges him to confess to the law. When he confesses the murders, he's imprisoned in Siberia to eight years of hard labour. He confesses everything to the judges, yet, after so much Raskolnikov has gone through, and everything in his life has changed, there is one thing that hasn't changed: His pride. Raskolnikov continues to justify his murder to himself, he continues insisting that what he did wasn't a crime nor a sin, it was a simple mistake. Raskolnikov never repented the crime. He always justified his action, and I believe this sends a strong social message because so many people are like this today. Being able to kill remorselessly, only feeling guilt because of what will happen to them; and yet, never being able to understand that what they did was indeed wrong. I loved the novel because it had a strong sense of anguish and malaise; Dostoyevsky basically wrote in a novel the social issues they had back then in the 1880s and the social issues we continue to have to this day: The constant battle of right and wrong, good and bad, the constant battle of justice and the battle of doing the right thing. Which is why I have to say it was an amazing novel, and that it is definitely worthy of being called by critics Fyodor Dostoyevsky's first masterpiece!"

There is his moral reservation, hesitation and terror reflecting in the heroine, the voice of reason in the devoted friends, the exaggerated perfection of his radical premises in the two villains, the species of wastefulness and madness delineated in alcoholism;pride and vice; and a ruined family. Everything highlight and reflect from his criminal psyche. Hope and terror, all. Love and suffering. The dream sequences--of animal cruelty, of gardens and beautiful summerhouses with a coffin--- give a view veiled in metaphor and feeling; breathing life to contradictions that could not be expressed as plain philosophy. But the dreams, the philosophical paragraphs, likewise; the nihilism, the economical theories, radical philosophy including; tempering the cynical with religious and moral feelings; all bring to bear on the his type of criminal mind. And what is this--a pathetic fumbling delusional murderer, brooding and sarcastic but with kindness and nobility in his heart?

Героят беше добре изграден, задълбочено представен и въпреки всичко, което направи, въпреки че безспорно е егоист, жлъчен и объркан, въпреки почти постоянно леещата се от него омраза, или именно заради нея, аз много, много го харесах. Тези негови Хамлетови дилеми, това постоянно самовглъбяване, алиенация и гордост ме поразиха и впечатлиха. Допадна ми и наличието на много силни женски фигури като Дуня и Соня. Това са все жени, които са преживели много, но въпреки това не са се предали и не са се обезверили.Буквално бях въвлечена в малкия свят на Родя и то толкова силно, че успях да усетя всички емоции и терзания, които Достоевски е искал да предаде. Обичам когато някоя книга успее да ме пренесе изцяло в света си и да ме накара да размишлявам за нея и за героите й. Именно тогава четенето ми доставя най - голямо удолоствие, а ""Престъпление и наказание"" определено успя да постигне този ефект.Това е една от книгите, които трябва да бъдат прочетени в правилния момент, за да бъдат оценени, разбрани, за да се превърнат в любими."
"2346",2345,"☯Emily ","This is a classic Russian novel, long and involved. I had a hard time getting interested in the novel. Part 1 really dragged as the Raskolnikoff planned a murder. However, after the murder is committed, it really got intriguing. Other characters begin to emerge and the interplay between them got complicated and weird. It might be helpful to know a little bit about the predominant philosophies in the intellectual community of Russia during the 1800's. There are long discussions about these philosophies throughout the book that can be confusing and mysterious if you don't have some basic knowledge of them."

From the beginning, I felt immersed in the mind of a criminal and as the book progressed, I felt myself sympathizing with Raskolnikov and even agreeing with the psychology of his actions. My perceptions of crime were twisted and stretched into another dimension of thinking. The conversations, in particular, with Raskolnikov and Porfiry contained some of the most interesting thoughts, and at certain times, I even came to fear Porfiry. The characters were also all very lifelike, in part because of the universal connections of suffering. The style of Crime and Punishment was also written unlike few other books that I've ever read, containing a terse, clear tone that English teachers always try to encourage students to use while writing essays. Because of this, I was able to visualize the dark world Dostoevsky was weaving and see many of the events in the book clearly and was even surprised by some of the plot twists; I cringed when Raskolnikov brought the axe down on Lizaveta and I shivered when Svidrigailov trapped Dounia in the tiny room. The delirium and fear of Raskolnikov's own mind further highlighted the darkness of the book. Overall, the book was excellent in plot and style, and the ideas it posed were unlike any others I had ever heard, causing me to be thinking and evaluating throughout all 600 pages. "
"2349",2348,"Larissa","I didn't quite like what he did to some of the characters as the narrative approached its end. however, it is a brilliant psychological narrative and you are compelled by the flow of thoughts and events to hang on to just another page."
"2350",2349,"Maria","I can't believe it took me almost 30 years to read this book, or at least that I never read it in college. It was a really intense reading experience, and I'm shocked that a book written so long ago in such a different culture than my own has the power to keep me flipping pages and move me like this one does. I read the Constance Garnett translation, and I hear the others are better, but this one was free, so there you have it. It was shockingly modern seeming, and funny, and relevant, and it is just really hard to believe that it was written at such a remove from the present. Also I've just joined a Russian book club (book club #4?) and am so excited about catching up on the Russian classics! On the other hand, at tonight's meeting, there was a young man who seemed to really identify with Raskolnikov and he was a little scary. As in, I made sure he left the library way before I did. He was totally into the idea that the rules only applied to some people and that other, ubermensch can do what serves them best. That is not the takeaway message you are supposed to get from this book. Right? RIGHT?"
"2351",2350,"Beatrice Gormley","Part of my great pleasure in re-reading C&P, for the first time since college, was in escaping from my environment (a 4-day power outage following the Blizzard of February 2013)to Raskolnikov's (St. Petersburg, Russia, during the hottest summer of the 19th century). "
"2352",2351,"Hanna","One of the best books I've read. I expected a dull and way too long book on some boring topic, but it was a real page-turner and I found myself staying up in the middle of the night (although I had the flu) reading it. There are several different stories in the book but they are all very nicely mapped-out and connected to each other and the overall themes in the book. The characters are some of the best I have ever read of, and I was surprised of the happiness that permeates them and the story, even if their lives, the events and the setting are so utterly depressing (as I imagine it is in most 19th century stories)."
"2353",2352,"Fuad Takrety","رواية رائعة أزعجني فيها بالفصول الأخيرة أن المترجم قام بحذف كثير من الناقاشات الفلسفية و الله أعلم لماذا "
"2354",2353,"Justin Nichols","Remarkable novel! A notch below his 'Brothers Karamazov' and Tolstoy's 'War & Peace', but still an absolutely superb work of realistic, philosophical fiction. The depth, wit, insight, honesty, and vulnerability in the characters made them both pitiable and admirable at once. And that ending... wow. What an author! They just don't make 'em like this anymore..."
"2355",2354,"April","Again, I read this in my teens, so it has been as while. However, something I love about the nineteenth century is the constant introspection at work within its writers. This seems true of most writers regardlesss of geograhical location. Through this introspection a hundreded questions arise and it is fabulous. "
"2356",2355,"Morgan","So much better than Tolstoy. Not as drab and Russian.It's basically Hamlet meets pre-Communist Russia meets Neitszche's theory of the Uber-mensch. I had a couple other things when I read it way back in highschool, but overall that sums it up. Kinda.However, not a good book to read in a very short period of time more or less in one sitting while taking notes and facing an all-day rehearsal of ""Oklahoma!"" Ouch."
"2357",2356,"Elizabeth","I enjoyed this book from the beginning. I expected it to be long a a bit dry. While there were aspects that grated a bit on the nerves, I fully enjoyed this book and hesitate to reread in, only because I fear that on re-reading it might lose some of the magic it still holds in my mind from my first reading."
"2358",2357,"Slávek Rydval","An excelent performance especially by Eduard Cupák (as narrator), Josef Vinklář as Svidrigajlov and Josef Somr as Marmeladov and Rudolf Hrušínský st. as Porfirij.I was a little bit disappointed by Václav Postránecký as Raskolnikov."
"2359",2358,"Sparrow","I loved the Constance Garnett translations of all of the Dostoyevsky I read. I was just reading that Sidney Monas has the most accurate translation of Crime and Punishment, however, so I might have to check that out. I'm not a huge fan of Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, despite all of their awards. I'll probably give them another chance at some point."
"2360",2359,"Viraj Verma","Some favorite quotes from the book-"" You think i am attacking them for talking nonsense? Not a bit! I like them to talk nonsense. That's man's one privilege over all creations. Through err you come to the truth! I am a man because i err! ""- Razumihin""Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery"" - Svidrigailov"" One can always forgive lying- lying is a delighful thing, for it leads to truth."" - Razumihinand finally,""Look at them running to and fro about the streets, everyone of them a scoundrel and criminal by heart and , worse still, an idiot But try to get me off and they'd be wild with righteous indignation.Oh, how i hate them all! "" Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov "
"2361",2360,"Ivan Frasure","Raskolnikov, a god in his own eyes, tries to bend reality into his mold but doesn't understand why it won't fit. His journey through the book seems to be a picture of a man devoid of God.I believe I am not objective enough in my reading, as it was a struggle to truly draw from this book some great and noble thread of truth, a lesson to be passed on for the ages. It isn't that they weren't there. Life was depicted clearly, and as such the lessons of life abound within the book, but it was disheartening reading the book, so much that it was a difficulty to overcome the depression that seeped from its pages. Even when punishment is dealt, still there is only the empty feeling of self righteousness, depression abounding still rather than delight at evil being found out, as more evils take its place.I rated it five stars, because how real it seemed, how clearly it seemed to show man without God."
"2362",2361,"Noelle","I loved this book. I really appreciate Dostoevsky's interesting female characters (even when they're a little flat, like Sonia), and I like that this is a psychologically-driven, rather than plot-driven, novel. The other driving force behind this novel is the Orthodox idea that happiness is only achieved through suffering. Raskolnikov, the main character, suffers greatly -- his own pride almost destroys him. The portrayal of human pride is really believable, as we see Raskolnikov cracking under the horror of what he has done, while at the same time holding onto a sort of infantile rage that his plans were thwarted, and that he's not the hero he thought he was. Sonia brings him hope, and although the epilogue is totally unconvincing, I still like happy endings."
"2363",2362,"Rscarff","I wish I knew Russian just so I could read this in its original language - a true masterpiece. The style of the writing is in certain ways a bit old fashioned, of course. Characters often speak uninterrupted for paragraphs at a time. The way that chapters frequently end with cliffhangers is probably now considered overly manipulative. And the epilogue seems to tie the story up more neatly than modern readers have come to expect and prefer. But generally, there's not much issue for a person reading this book today vs. one reading it around the time it was first published. In fact, one of the things I prefer about Dostoyevsky's style is the amount of detail he provides in each scene. He gives just enough to paint a clear picture in the reader's mind without slipping into that zone of information overload that so many contemporary novels are unable to avoid. Beyond my stylistic observations, what Crime and Punishment represents is one of the most thorough explorations of human psychology I have ever encountered. That this psychology exists within such an entertaining story is the novel's great accomplishment, and I hope to discover similar achievements in the next of the author's work that I intend to read, The Brothers Karamazov."
"2364",2363,"Hajer Elmahdi ","At a point in your life you began to realize the obligation you have towards classics, you just owe it to yourself to read Dostoyevsky, i picked this one for i have set a goal to read whatever classics i can put my hands on, and i couldn't feel better i'm even proud of myself there's a hint of pleasure and accomplishment running through my veins while writing this because honestly Fyodor is MIND BLOWING. Spoiler Alert! this is a short review only contained leading characters ""in my opinion"" (view spoiler)[Story takes place in ST.Petersburg Russia, Raskolnikov a former student is the leading character in the story, he's smug, arrogant delusional and a divided character, troubled young man who his pride and intelligence leads him into thinking he's superior to the rest of mankind, he believes the world falls into two categories ""Superior"" special people who can do whatever they want with no law of moral boundaries and second class who had everyone else. He believes he can break the rules in this case commit murderer for higher purposes, such as doing good and helping humanity with what he steals, so Raskolnikov murders the pawn keeper Alyona Ivanovna and Lizaveta her step sister, however guilt torments him and he believes he's not a Napoleon material, the idea of confessing torments him through the whole book, while reading i came to the conclusion he is crazy! even tho he thinks about confessing but not for the sake of being guilty for murdering the pawn keeper, he remains convinced that his crime was justified. Raskolnikov’s relationships with the other characters in the novel do help in understanding of his conflicted personality. Although he cares about Razumikhin, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and Dunya, Raskolnikov is so caught up in his own head to the point he never notices their attempts to help him. He finds Sonya, his connection to Sonya was due to him thinking she's a sinner like him but what he fails to understand that Sonya's sin is selfless she sacrifices herself to help her parents and her three siblings but he essentially commits his crime for his sake alone to prove his theory. Sonya is a quite poor devoted girl who sacrifices herself prostituting for the sake of her family. Sonya, in her infinite capacity for understanding, begins to care deeply for him. She is not horrified by his crimes, but rather, concerned for his soul and mental well-being, urges him to confess.Dunya is Raskolnikov’s sister also one of the main characters in the novel. She is intelligent, proud, beautiful, and strong-willed. she is the strongest female character in the novel, neither as crushed by poverty nor as timid as Sonya.Svidrigailov is as conflicted as Raskolnikov, first he's represented as a villain, he murders his wife, attempted to rape Dunya, tries to marry a 16 years old girl but still we witness Svidrigailov perform goods deeds, such as giving money to the family of his fiancée, to Katerina Ivanovna and her children, and to Dunya. Although he is a violent and sneaky and dishonest snake he's some how capable of doing good, when Dunya rejects him. Although the painful realization that she will neverlove him forces him into committing suicide.  (hide spoiler)]"" Consciousness might be the promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his future resurrection"" This story isn't about who killed the pawn keeper, that we know form the beginning,it's about poverty, redemption, pride love understanding and forgiveness i cried at the end not because it was sad but because it couldn't have ended in a better way ."
"2365",2364,"Christopher James","I couldn't possible be more impressed with this book. As far as I'm concerned, this novel is a masterpiece, and Dostoyevsky is a genius. I can rarely recall being so consumed and involved by such a remarkable and powerful text. "
"2366",2365,"Mihai Criveti","I've read this book twice (once in Romanian and once in English). The first time I picked the wrong version on goodreads (for some reason only the audiobook version pops up when you search this book)."
"2367",2366,"Parthiban Sundaram","I recently read Dostoevsky's novel Crime and punishment and greatly enjoyed it. This is not a review. Just some notes:+ Crime and Punishment is, in a way, an exploration of what happens when you stretch a theory to the extremes. (But I do not know philosophy that well to decide if the theory itself is extreme or if it is being stretched, so you decide. :-)) + The novel explores the life of Raskolnikov, a very intelligent but poor student who is consumed by the ideas of his times like utilitarianism and nihilism that propel him down the slippery slope path of murder, convincing himself that a murder is noble when it is good for the society at large. When Alexander the Great kills thousands presumably for the good of the society at large, why can't he too murder? That is the motive behind the murder committed by the protaganist. + How bizarre, extravagantly fantastic and out-of-the-world this idea is! I feel like a baby when I consider my own thoughts and ideas in comparison with something as big and lunatic as that! Even when we have all the philosophy behind a crime like murder, as Dostoevsky captures in his lucid and eloquent prose, it is hard to escape the consequences. + What fun to read this novel and to go inside the mind of a murderer: the endless, inescapable cycle of various emotions - the guilt that depresses, the reason that struggles to explain, the shame to face your own mother and sister, and the fear of getting caught - is captured so well that it is no surprise when you hear that Dostoevsky is a master of psycho analyses. Even the unreal, almost fantasmogorical idea of murder gets real and believable when buttressed with such compendious analyses.+ Character development is remarkable. Surprisingly, in this big book, there are not too many characters; The story revolves around only a handful of them. Doctor that helps to theorize and explain the workings of mind, the family members and the lover who bind Raskolnikov to society - in a way, force him away from his nihilism, and finally throw him a lifeline of love, his friend Razumikhin, his sister's fiance, his sister's ex-employer are all excellently developed, believable characters. Above all, the investigator Porfiry Petrovich's character is very well sketched and developed - his understanding of crime, criminals and his experience that shows in his patience and supremely clever attempts to find out the truth during his investigations of Raskolnikov.+ The plot is divided into two parts: first, crime; second, punishment. There are plenty of twists, and scenes full of suspense and intrigue just as any crime novel would have. I have not been a big fan of crime/detective novels, but this novel just shatters any fixed, 'unbaked' idea about this genre. Crime novels can be written in such compelling, engaging manner - it is as much about life, love, ideals as about money, murder, police and death. Just like any good art, Crime and punishment transcends any artificial boundaries of genres.+ If not anything, at least the investigation scenes involving Porfiry Petrovich and Raskolnikov alone needs a special mention. It is some of the best, very intelligently written scenes I have ever read. When we know who the killer is, the investigator knows who the killer is, the killer knows that the investigator knows, it all comes down to the technicality of proof. You must read to see how Dostoevsky handles these situations! What a fine read! Greatly recommend. "
