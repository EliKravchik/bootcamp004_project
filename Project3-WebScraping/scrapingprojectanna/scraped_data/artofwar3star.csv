"2",1,"Ivy Zhang","i give ratng 3 is mainly because this is not the typical book i would like to read Mr Sun Tze had lot of interesting points writte in the book. it is a very famous chinese army book. I knew the name of the book and the author by heart when studying history at school. however I had never got interests to read such book back then. I saw the English version of this book at a randomly opportunity, I had chance finally to read it. the books is mainly around topics of how to plan and win a war in different situations. for me, Mr Sun Tzu is actually a pioneer of psychologist. he emphasis how important morals plays in the war. how commander should take advantage of external factors and build up morals of militaries. he talked about winning a war does not mean victory and true victory is winning with easy. there are many interesting physiological points which can br easily applied to any other situations other than war. I can tell why this book is still being read by people nowadays."
"4",3,"Tim Weakley","Marginally more enjoyable than The Prince. I still found this to be basically a collection of common sense advice from the military perspective. It must have been revolutionary when it was first collected but there were very few true insights to my way of thinking."

"15",14,"Kelanth","Il libro è sicuramente interessante e degno dio lettura, ma per chi come me non è un poco studioso o informato di filosofia cinese troverà, alcune lacune di comprensione nella lettura.Se teniamo conto che questo libro è stato scritto duemilacinquecento anni fa, possiamo renderci conto del valore di questo testo che è ancora letto tutt'oggi. Quanti lo sono?La narrazione si presta a varie interpretazioni, sia ad un livello di base, che tratta sistematicamente di tecniche militari, sia ad un livello più metaforico ed ampio che è il pensiero di Sun Tzu di come affrontare la vita di tutti i giorni. In questo livello di lettura si possono trarre ""numerose pillole di vita"", ma probabilmente l'insegnamento principe è che ""la miglior battaglia è quella che vinciamo senza combattere"". Da leggere, ma per una vera comprensione del testo, occorre una bella infarinatura di filosofia orientale.http://kelanthsblog.blogspot.com/"

"31",30,"Philippe Malzieu","This text is regarded as one of the reference in strategies (with Clausewitz for example). He was written during the time of the combatants kingdoms. There, it was important to be the more effective strategically as possible. We have in France the traduction of the jesuit Amiot. After the Father Ricci who finished his life as Emperor advisor (his tomb in in an university garden in Beijin), many jesuits had gone in China. The book is divided into 13 chapters beginning all with ""Master Sun said."" All is articulated around an only goal, to overcome and beat the enemy, It is necessary to win about is the used ways. We are not in delicacy. One lies, one cheating one trick.That does not disturb me if it is for acts of war. The top of art of the war is to subject the enemy without crossing iron. So the importance of spying.But this book wants to be more than that: a treaty of life. He wants to be a metaphysic manual. Not to see in others his own image is not acceptable. One should not give to this text a universal range. It is only a treaty on the way of gaining a war. Not other.Point."
"33",32,"Vanesa","I wanted more...I found it common sense. Or is my ""common sense"" not so common?, perhaps. I can't tell. But, indeed, I wanted more and that' a good thing."
"35",34,"Jinu","It's all about war and certain aspects of it that I did not enjoy like bribing spies. But it also talks about using force only when needed and best way is when the enemy surrenders. Overall it was a different reading experience for me and war is all about strategy be it with managing resources and army and psychologically manipulating the enemy. The setting of this book is ancient and limited to attack on land."
"38",37,"Gene Leo","Like it or hate it, you have to admit - this is one of the manliest books ever written. Each statement is filled with so much confidence, power and arrogance I had a thick beard by the time I finished reading it. "
"44",43,"Chad Sayban","“All warfare is based on deception.”“The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.”Born in the fifth century B.C., Sun Wu (Sun Tzu was an honorary title) wrote the quintessential rulebook for warfare, known today as Art of War. While the often quoted lines of Sun Tzu are as lyrical as poetry, it was written 2,500 years ago with the singular purpose of codifying the essential requirements for generals and soldiers to be victorious on the battlefield. Even today, his treatise on war is studied by not just military officers, but business leaders and politicians as a roadmap to victory.While most of us have heard of Art of War and have no doubt read many of the catchy anecdotes that populate Sun Tzu’s writing, I dare say very few people have actually read the work from start to finish. While the version I read was about 300 pages, less than 50 pages make up the actual translated writings of Sun Tzu. That text is preceded by a rather informative historical overview of the life of Sun Wu – of which only a few documented facts are known. More importantly, the introduction does a good job of establishing the climate that Sun Tzu lived in within what we now know as China. Frankly, I found this to be the best and most informative part of the text.Sun Tzu’s actual text is written as a series of individual statements that appear to have been cobbled together. I’m unsure if this is the result of how the work was translated or if the original text was pieced together from scattered writings, but it gives the writing a disjointed feel. However, I can accept this limitation given that it was written as a technical document more than two millennia ago in a different language. From a content perspective, there are many well-known phrases that ring true today. But while the general philosophies are what we remember, the lion’s share of his text details very specific situations and strategies for warfare of that era. The remainder of the book – more than half of it in fact – is a detailed breakdown of individual passages from Sun Tzu’s text, expanded upon and placed into the context of more modern battles throughout history. This was the most problematic portion of the book because in a lot of cases it was a very tenuous leap to connect the specific tactics of some of the cited battles to the specific situations Sun Tzu wrote about. Sun Tzu’s text is just ambiguous enough that almost anything can be read into some of the passages. It was more wishful thinking than established doctrine that associated some of the examples to his writing. And while Art of War may include many philosophical musings that are usable today, most of Sun Tzu’s writing about specific military tactics– while educational from a historical perspective – are wildly obsolete in the modern world. As a fascinating historical document that illustrates the thinking and strategy of an era where little has survived the ravages of time, Art of War is an invaluable resource. But as a current day treatise on the conduct of war and competitive strategy, it is really lacks concrete value. Anecdotes aside, I’m pretty sure that no modern standing army or corporate think-tank is sending its best and brightest into the trenches with nothing but Sun Tzu’s writing even though some believe Art of War is the end-all, be-all of strategic thought. It would be a little like arguing before the Supreme Court with no other legal education outside of reading a lot of John Grisham novels. I think Art of War is a valuable work, but it has achieved a sort of cult following in certain circles that outstrips its actual contribution to strategy. The authors of this translation have gone overboard in assigning value to his teaching – value that can’t really be substantiated. Is it an important historical document? Absolutely. Is it the cornerstone of all of the strategic thought that exists today? Not hardly. While Sun Tzu was in fact a brilliant strategist and philosopher, Art of War wasn’t even translated into a western language until 1772 (French) and 1905 (English). I’m pretty sure most of these strategies had been discovered and utilized by western armies long before then. Perhaps the most important thing that is lost in the supplementation of Art of War is Sun Tzu’s primary motivation for writing his treatise. While his text is held up as the guide to war, this translation does hit on a key philosophy – it was peace that Sun Tzu was most interested in. He wanted his countrymen to be able to protect themselves and allow for the citizens to live in peace, not war. All you have to read for proof of that is what I think is the most important sentence he wrote:“There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.”Amen to that."
"45",44,"K.M. Weiland","Its depth is found in its simplicity. But I can’t say that I found it life changing. The famous quote about “knowing your enemy” was the best bit. Would have been much better without the translator’s constant interpolation of footnotes. Easily two-thirds of the book was the editor talking vs. Sun Tzu."

Sem notas de apoio é um livro dificil de compreender até porque a tradução do mandarim para línguas ocidentais tem muitas expressões que não apresentam ligação.Interessante mas não é um livro de leitura comum e por isso ao fim de um tempo torna-se um livro um pouco pesado apesar de não ser muito extenso."

"74",73,"Stan","It seems that everyone is quoting this book, from Movies and TV shows to preachers to movie stars to the working class as if the book has some scared ancient knowledge. Most of the book seems to be common sense like attack if you out number your opponent 5 to 1, feeding and equipping army cost money and so on. Yet I am often reminded that common sense is often a rare quality just look at our political leaders. So while this book may state the obvious it is still fullof advice that I wish our leaders would follow."

"93",92,"Jerry","Quite a nice book about how not to wage war for nothing. Of course, the lessons need to be applied and although the military equipment and battles have changed through times, many of Sun Tzu's advice can still be taken into account today. Even in daily life, when you struggle with something or someone. He tells us how to appear weak when we are strong, and strong when we are weak. He tells us how we must know our enemy as well as ourselves in order to end up victorious. And so on, and so on. It's truly interesting, besides, we can easily compare the way he describes war with the way we struggle with some people, The Art of War is a masterpiece that teaches how to become a war mastermind."
"95",94,"Daniel Ribera","I recently accessed a couple of lists of recommended books on the topic of leadership. The Art of War by Sun Tzu was on one such list. Being a short book I decided to read it. All I will say is that if this is the image that some have of the task of leadership we are in big trouble. I understand the wisdom of planning and action. Those are two take-aways that I can and do adopt. However, if leadership is viewed as being equivalent to a military encounter with a hostile enemy then I need to part company with those who follow such a idea of leadership.Regarding Sun Tzu, the 5th/6th century BC, Chinese, military genius, I am impressed. As a Westerner, I am largely ignorant of the knowledge and achievements extant in the East five centuries before Christ. This little book helped to correct my lack of knowledge. Sun Tzu is an experienced, military leader, strategist, and even teacher. He has insight into the psychology of his soldiers, the advantages of various terrain, fighting in various circumstances and situations, and even the advantage of dealing with spies.Thank you, Sun Tzu for teaching me, so now I will know to have the hill over my right shoulder in battle, and not to despair when I am pinned down. I'll try to find peaceful applications of your advice as I have opportunity to lead."

"138",137,"Natasha Primaditta","Finished with the book, I still wanted to retain my previous comment about the book. I said before that reading this book reminds me of a business book for leaders and managers alike. Why? Simply because it contains a somewhat step-by-step how to war right from preparation period to actually waging the war. In the world of business or even the daily life, there were many encounters with both your allies and foes, positioning yourself to gain the most from it sometimes kinda war like. Assessing the situations, managing resources, laying out plans, and controlling the fields as a leader, both to your surrounding and yourself needs an artful approaches for your internal purposes. I like the old wisdoms that on some part still relevant nowadays intertwined with Chinese virtues. Such as: ""While speed may sometimes be injudicious, tardiness can never be anything but foolish.""""If you know your enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.The thing that really bugs me was the commentators that's numerous and arguing without clear conclusions of Sun Tzu's principles. That's also means that each of his principles can be translated as reader see fit when the commentators' comments didn't help on making the principles as a fixed and clearly defined ones."
"142",141,"Evan","This is a different version that the one I first read. I dont remember liking this book as much as the first edition I read, but I will probably try the B&N Collectors Library that combines ""Art of War"" with ""The Prince"" next.

"152",151,"Jeff Derosa","I read Thomas Cleary's translation. This reads like a book of aphorisms. I suspect when applied as a metaphor to our respective careers, misinterpretation of these lessons can do harm. I can also see how thorough study of Sun Tzu's teachings and proper application can improve any person's leadership abilities. For me, I feel this book has helped me as a voter when faced with acts of war/terrors. It has also helped me better form opinions about world history. First, as a voter, this book will help me carefully consider going to war after dark moments such as terrorism. Sun Tzu warns against going to war based off emotion. I'm thankful for this perspective. As a student of history, I find reading this book goes well paired with the Sun Tzu specific ""Military Documentary"" produced by the History channel. This documentary does a great job relating this book's teachings to the Civil War, WWII, and Vietnam - both successes and failures to follow these lessons. "
"154",153,"Conchita Masci","As a political science major I can't believe it took me so long to read this book. As a basis for all political activity it is succinct in what is needed to bring about change. The use of this book as a tool for literal wat is evident but my surprise is in how it can be used in everyday life and work situations. :) I guess that is why you see so many spin offs of the book. "
"156",155,"George Shubin","It's about a lot more than simply warfare. It's really about any conflict or struggle. Taken metaphorically, the author's advice can easily apply to politics, business, or any other place that contention exists.A good portion of the book deals with leadership and the best qualities of a leader: “Leadership is a matter of intelligence, trustworthiness, humaness, courage, and sternness.” Discipline in leadership, with established rewards and punishments that are consistently applied across the board, is of utmost importance. Whether you are a coach, a corporate executive, a politician, or a general, this is very good advice.The best part of ""The Art of War"" is when the author talks of knowing yourself and knowing your enemy:""So it is said that if you know others and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not know others but know yourself, you win one and lose one; if you do not know others and do not know yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.""Going into competition without understanding one's opponents, and worse, sometimes without even knowing oneself, give the opposition a key advantage and sets oneself up for defeat. You must always know your own strengths and weaknesses as well as those of your opponent. Sun Tzu’s advice rings true in a great many situations."

"178",177,"PlatKat","Back when I was the tender age of 16, a guy I really liked lent me this book. He said it was his favorite book and that I would love it too. I excitedly rushed home to devour this piece of literature in hopes that we could have one more thing in common to bring us even closer together.Now I'm 28, and the more things change, the more they stay the same. This time, I am living in sin with the guy I do so very much desire, and I know he doesn't give a rat's ass whether I read the book or not.But just like there are some American classics that should be read at some point in one's life, there are Eastern works that should be read too. I guess I shouldn't be surprised to find this whole book reads like a 1,000 slips of paper pulled from 1,000 fortune cookies. And just like the cookies, there aren't any actual fortunes, but maxims that you can apply to your own life as you see fit.I liked that Sun Tzu stated that no country has benefited from prolonged warfare. So even if you're a master strategist or debater, eventually you're going to have to stop fighting and take a break. It's best to take the path of least resistance and conquer without fighting if you can.I didn't agree that ""standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength,"" especially as it applies to regular life. People have made some foolhardy decisions to attack people (or countries) without thinking about it, and it comes back to bite them. Even if you have the manpower, trying to show strength by waging an attack seems to go against the advice given in the previous paragraph.Some of the maxims were pretty obvious. Of course you'd use flags and gongs to unite your ground troops in the absence of modern technology. And you'd obviously want to work with, not against, nature and the terrain.I had the biggest problem with his following advice to generals: ""If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbids it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.""Isn't this insubordination? How can you know for sure if something will result in victory? What if you're wrong? In the beginning, he stressed the importance of knowing one's own abilities as well as the enemy's abilities, but you can never truly know either of those 100 percent of the time.Anyway, I can finally say I've slogged through this whole book and will try to keep its wisdom in mind as I carry out my significantly less crucial matters. For now, I have won the battle of concentration. (Took me long enough.)"

"202",201,"Muhammad al-Khwarizmi","Sunzi is rightly recognized as a master of armed conflict. It is even claimed, probably correctly, that his principles apply also to adversarial relations outside of the domain of war. (Consider the quotation of the character Bud Fox from Wall Street: ""All warfare is based on deception."") I can see in The Art of War advice that was well-followed by victors and advice that was ignored by the defeated. Certainly Harold Godwinson would have done well to heed the injunction not to pursue simulated flights, had he heard it. The Romans, in dealing with the Parthians, should have done the same. Nevertheless, some of the ideas in this book are very dated, peculiar to the conditions of Bronze Age China, or possibly even spurious. For example, the following ""special days"" are singled out for the application of fire in warfare: ""those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind"". I would be very surprised if the configuration of the Moon or other celestial bodies correlated with wind conditions, especially when looking at potential battlefield conditions not only in China, but anywhere in the world.

"207",206,"Ahmed","No doubt this pamphlet is great and provides basic techniques that are better be used during wars, but it is old. I mean no one nowadays fights using swords, carriages, and fire. I like this pamphlet but reading it feels more like reading instruction manual. On the other hand, The reason why I like it is simply because it contains some true and smart moves that can help you in for instance your career , ( e.g. to overthrow your boss and take his place). What I don't like is hypocrisy and deceit even though they are considered important to Sun Tzu.For me, the keys to win anything in life are patience and observations. Patience and observations are important. The Art of War 21st century written by me, goes as follows;1. Go to the kitchen to prepare popcorn for yourself 2. Take the popcorn and a bottle of beer and head down to the living room and sit to watch the TV3. Call your nuclear specialist and ask him to launch 3 to 5 nuclear bombs over country X or Y.4. Ask him to film everything and make it seen on your living-room TV5. Enjoy your popcorn while watching Country X or Y get DELETED THE END "

It is interesting how Sun Tzu's ancient writings are not only applicable to war-craft (heh, get it? :P) -- I mean, I cannot imagine I'll be leading armies of rice-eating dudes any time soon or, indeed, ever -- they can be useful spiritual guidance to pretty much any conflict's successful resolution, from playing StarCraft and other war games, like Europa Universalis, to trying to regain that girl's attention: 'all's fair in love and war', after all. It was also a satisfying experience to get a first-hand experience with such a widely quoted work, especially by games like Total War. "

I found it, after a struggle, on this website: http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Art...It only took me 2 hours to read. I’m sure it takes a lot longer to digest and put into practice, but at the end of the day I’m not in the business of invading anyone else’s kingdom (not today anyway), I just wanted to read it because one of the characters I’m writing about was reading it, and I wanted to know what she would have seen.It’s a nice little book that I’m sure would have been of great help to warriors and leaders and those of that ilk. Do we still have warriors? I suppose we do – there are still wars.It’s a bit worrying really thinking about people using this text as the basis of their war efforts, because most of it seems to be about cheating and deception.But then, I suppose all marketing and most of selling is based on some form of sleight of hand. If I’m wrong – I apologise, but I think… oh, actually, it’s only selling for profit that this applies to. Some transactions involving honest exchange and barter could possibly be excluded.Can’t think of anything else to say about this; so that means (to me) that I‘ve finished."

The most impressive thing to me (which is explained in the introductory material) is how well the Chinese recorded their history. My only complaint about the introductory materials was that most great Chinese historical figures have multiple names - this makes it hard to track who is who in some of the commentaries. The actual strategies themselves are full of guidelines on determining your opponent's weaknesses, exploiting them and achieving victory. Not exactly full of moral or ethical advice, so I can't use much of it. I'm glad that I read it as it gave me a great look into Chinese history...but its practical use in my world is limited."

"273",272,"Hannah Braid","The ‘Sun’ Always Rises:A Book Review of Sun Tzu’s The Art of War	An office worker wouldn’t need knowledge of ancient Chinese warfare, right? Sun Tzu’s legendary guide to life holds lessons from ancient China that have resonated through history to contain relevance today. The list format makes the reader feel as though they sitting in a classroom learning from a textbook. This shifts the book from a novel to a guide, taking out the personable aspect. The guide’s voice places the reader as an inferior to the superiority of General Sun Tzu, which is the tone this information would have carried in warring China. I enjoyed the ideas within the text even though I was not a huge fan of the format.	Furthermore, the ideals from Sun Tzu’s military philosophy apply marvelously to the shark tank of modern business. Knowing your weakness, strategy over strength, and staying ahead of the crowd are all important and relevant in today’s crazy world. The foresight and pure truths of human nature that sprung from Sun Tzu’s mind and stratagem were strong enough to surpass even his civilization. Throughout time, people will always have an opponent to conquer or a social ladder to climb. It is an unavoidable consequence of our hierarchal existence. However, with the right insight and proper preparation, we can overcome the challenges of our petty problems. The key is revealed when Sun Tzu says, “It is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.” We see that we should learn ourselves, notice others, and plan each movement to reach success.

I feel like there needs to be two ratings for this particular book: one for the words of Sun Tzu himself and one for the commentary and footnotes. Because if I was rating just Sun Tzu, I probably would've given it something higher. His thoughts (or the translation of them) are concise and very practical, and some can be applied to situations outside war.The commentary was where I had the issue. In my copy, every point Sun Tzu made was interrupted by commentary explaining the text or giving other people's thoughts on the subject. I wanted to read and make my own conclusions, not be told how other people interpreted it. So after a while I started skipping over all that commentary.So if I ever found myself in a bookstore, I would make sure the next copy of this I picked up had all the footnotes and commentary at the end of the book, because it being in the middle of the text was very distracting and made the reading itself less pleasant."

I can see how Sun Tzu's view when it comes to applying it towards business opportunity or capital financing strategy for the business (whether debt, or equity or both, or etc),, that how a few simple things may combine into many possibilities. so fellow goodreads-ers buddies, i strongly recommend the book if you are interested in art of leadership, or some would say business strategy ( i would say this sort of true) . but for me who quite cant understand a couple of things (sometimes i find it hard to read between the lines , lol >.< ), after getting a recommendation from a Goodreads-buddy of mine, he would say i should get (or just download) the translation and explanation version of the book as well, so it would help me out in understanding and improve interpretation of the meaning for the quotes.but overall, its one of the must-read book , at least once :)"

"317",316,"Dwight Acorda","The Art of War is an impressive account of battle tactics and strategies devised by the legendary Sun Tzu. This war general has a thorough understanding of the inner workings of conflict and the psychology behind why people wage war against others. He also conceived particular strategies on denouncing opposition/enemies through counter-maneuvers, the appearance of weakness to lure and eventually expose the enemy, and reverse psychology. Despite being translated into English, through use of figurative language, Tzu is able to weave interesting word play that enhances one's understanding of his strategies and philosophy on dealing with conflict. If you choose to read this account, find value in doing so. You will gain some valuable insight reading this work and have a clearer awareness and understanding on dealing with conflict. It will also teach you to deal with inner conflict and master self control through relaxation and emotional aptitude. He further deals with high awareness and opening of the mind, and deciphering weaknesses in everything. Side note: This work is actually required reading for many Japanese business executives, applying Sun Tzu's teachings into their business and entrepreneurship. "

A point-by-point instructional compilation on war tactics and strategies, the cross-applications are extensive. About 20% of the way in the book lags, as there are numerous injections about the proper translation, along with speculation on who actually said what and when. Personally, I most enjoyed the stories and instances that were included to expound upon certain points/scenarios. But it was enlightening to gain the full scope of the piece I've heard quoted from for as far back as I can remember.For a book on warfare, I was impressed with how much of it was focused on efficiency, psychology, and humanity, rather than simply glorifying brutality. All in all, an indisputably valuable book. But not something that could be termed a ""light read."" "
"351",350,"Brad McKenna","It's amazing that a centuries old ""book"" is still worth a read. This version is illustrated with many ancient pretty pictures! It also has a nearly 60 page introduction by the translator. Which was useful, at times, because it fit the book into a historical perspective. It also let me know that the book to follow was more than just the original text. Master Sun's advice would be given and then any number of commentators would give their two cents. Because of the ambiguous nature of the Chinese language this was actually pretty helpful. Another trait of the Chinese language, or maybe just Master Sun, was to explain both sides of the coin. For example he suggests an army hit their opponents where they are weak and then turns around and suggests the army NOT hit them where they're strong. For my Western mind, it seemed redundant. But that's what Master Sun thought. My three biggest takaways were:1.) Strategy means paying attention to your enemy and practicing misdirection. It also means attacking only when you're assured victory and you can only be assure victory if the citizens and the army are behind attacking. 2.) Adaptability is also very important. An army should be like water, it has no innate form and as a result adjusts as needed to overwhelm obstacles. 3.) Terrain was surprisingly important. Out of the 13 chapters, it was the ones on terrain that Sun had the most to say. I'm talking paragraphs where in other chapters there would be but a sentence or two. I'd suggest picking this up. It's really interesting and a quick read. "

When I won the Golden War Trophy at the ancient Chinese warriors version of the Oscars, Sun Tzu would have been the first to receive gratitude in my teary speech.But let’s face the hard truth in the bleak daylight. I’m no Chinese general. I would bet against me in any hand-to-hand combat. So this book did little to stir the fire in my testosterone-laden loins.To be fair, I’m sure that I could make some analogies to business, or writing, or anything competitive, really.

As if honed on the whetstones of countless ages of war, cycles of peace and war, prosperity and ruin. The book is written like a discourse, succinct like a military handbook and instructive like a textbook. Examples from various wars and legends and folklore combine to form a beautiful mosaic of anecdotal bits of knowledge. It covers all aspects of warfare and successful warcraft - from planning (in times of peace, plan for war and vice versa .. etc.), to tactics, to armies (their moods, methods to train and control them), to maneuvering on the battlefield, to spying, to diplomacy , to signing of accords and finally to court defeat. It shows starkly the contrast between civilian virtue and military etiquette and warns of the dire consequences of defeat as flagrantly as it warns of excess and overambition in victory. Best of all, it does so in a no-nonsense, uninhibited flow of prose which is over in less than a 100 pages.And even better, the ancient allegories spill out from the battlefield and find meaning and application, in real life (in peace, as in war, the art of war shows the path, to ruin or to prosperity)."

Instead, I found a lot of common sense ideas about organizing and motivating a culture of people towards a common goal. Evidently, the wisdom of Sun Tzu was not solely related to effective strategies during conflict, but also to the psychological component of the human condition: physical and mental needs, loyalty, respect, internalized fear, and implied force.

As stated from a European letter in Giles' introduction: ""Many of Sun Tzu Wu's maxims are perfectly applicable to the present day."" The types of warfare that are faced today are much different and more advanced than back in the day, so the instructions listed in this book are more applicable to the lives of people now.The treatise begins with a narrative between Sun Tzu and Ho Lu, the King of Wu, who appoints Tzu as general when he sees how well his principles discipline and train his soldiers. The book shifts into twenty-seven pages about ancient Chinese warfare and then into the thirteen chapters of the book, which lay out the specific instructions that a general must follow in order to be successful. While reading this book, the reader will discover the five constant factors, knowing the enemy and catching them off guard, the use of spies, and the importance of terrain.Overall, I enjoyed reading this book. It's probably one of the only books that I have read that I can relate to so many things other than its intended purpose. I would recommend this book to those who like reading about war and war strategies, business, leadership, and people who just want more insight on how to tackle the battles and enemies that this life throws as us. "
"384",383,"Namratha","I think my book tastes are currently blinkered by my Baahubali obsession. I also picked up this particular book because snippets about it kept popping up in other unrelated reads.It is, yes in fact a military treatise and is therefore quite dry and lace-your-boots-up stern in it's tone. You can't actually say that you ""enjoyed"" reading this book. Some quotes are quite erm...quotable and I add them here for posterity :""If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.""""Water shapes it's course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing."""

"392",391,"Patrik Hallberg","I agree that this book is a must read. It's the first known study of the planning and conduct of military operations and your can learn about different types of spies, how to react in different terrains etc. As a military strategy book or as a historical document it probably deserves a higher rating, but since I'm much more of a make love not war type of guy there are many more books that I enjoy more."
"396",395,"Raphael Bernardo","I had high expectations because this book gets quoted is all the time. Then I read another review that most of this book is common sense. I kinda agree this book is overrated, or maybe I didn't get it. I expected an entire book full of really wise quotes. Maybe 1 in 8 are, and the rest are strategies regarding cost of soldiers, how to kill the enemy with the given material, how you shouldn't fight if soldiers have no moral, things about carriages, etc. The intro of the book spoke about how they used more than 8 ancient experts with different interpretations to make their translation. I don't know where all the work went because it's a really simple battle common sense guide. "

"410",409,"Linda Hamonou","This book was sort of wicked. My version has a translation and a lot of notes made of different comments for historical people, it's too bad however that it didn't contain the original Chinese.The book is full of very practical advises about war, going from what you should look at on your enemy, as what you should look at with your own soldier and taking into account every external factors, such as climate and ground. It is also a philosophy about the path of life which is very interesting. You should wait long enough but at the same time not miss the right opportunity. I was hoping for something more philosophical and less practical. It won't replace for me ""Zen in the art of archery"" which remains so far my favorite philosophical book based on warfare. "

"413",412,"Matthew Lindell","The Art of War is hailed as a ""must read"" for students of management. I disagree, if in so saying, they are likening management to war, the playing of your strengths to your opponents weaknesses to win the day. Win/Lose management is failed approach that may have short-term benefits but is unsustainable in the long-term. Management is about the negotiation of ideas to achieve shared goals and objectives; win/win.Now, if you are looking for ancient wisdom on how to evaluate your environment, organize and motivate your teams, play to your strengths, etc. there is some value and perhaps wisdom. However, to achieve that goal I would heartily recommend The Bible instead.Rather, where I found value/interest in this book was the depth and sophistication of the ancient eastern world. I therefore read it as a historical work lending insight into the thinking that has laid a foundation for military tactics over the last several millennia. So, if interested in a historical read - go for it. If interested in strengthening your management skills and thinking - I would pass."

I found this book to be interesting and I enjoyed listening to audiobook.

"425",424,"Taylor Storey","I thought it was appropriate to listen to this millenia old Chinese book on the way to Beijing. I've heard it is the most read book of all time apart from the bible. It's about military strategy but puts it in a way that can apply to almost any kind of achieving-your-goals situation you want to apply it to.The audio edition is only an hour and 15 mins long (without commentary) so the investment was minimal, and for the investment...worth it. A predecessor to the modern self help genre. Could be a good one to read when you are pushing to achieve some goals. ""It is not enough to put ones trust in the tethering of horses or in chariot wheels in the ground"" ... Sound similar to the bible readers? Don't command ""the army to advance or retreat, being ignorant that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army."" I read the Giles translation...seemed good."
"426",425,"Levie Galapon","Essentially a classic in strategic writing that is a good read for anyone who studies strategy or military history. Sun Tzu uses interesting metaphors to teach valuable lessons when going into battle. Over all, its a very easy read and I would suggest to read it since the lessons it teaches are still applicable to today."

"431",430,"Fidelis Satriastanti","It is thin. It is practical. Yet, it carries almost all the things you need or want to know about how to win a battle or a war. Not necessarily a real battle, I might add. But, everyday battle or war in getting something you want and how exactly you can get it. You got to hail Chinese philosophy and practices when it comes on being successful, it's simple and just 'immortal'. This book is hundred of years old yet it still very much relevant to modern days of 'battles and wars'. I am not kidding. For instance, one of its wisdom is being early on the field of the battle before your enemy. I can actually relate to 'being early for meetings or interviews' so I have that extra time to prep up myself and nailed it :p Second, observe five main factors of the art of war : (1) The Moral Law (2) Heaven (3) Earth (4) The Commander (5) Method and Discipline. Basically, it's about the rules, the weather, the area, the leader, and the methods. If you grasps these five factors then you shall cultivate victory (which applies not only a real war but for selling goods, I suppose). I do like to relate to these factors (my odd way to inspire myself :p). In my ways of actualizing myself, either in training or writing, I need to set my own regulations (Dos or Donts), pay attention to the weather as it may bring down or light up the mood (aka heavy rains means traffic jams and floods), always aware on the location where I work or train, being a leader of my own, create methods to only be applicable on my own terms. So, let's make peace not war! (Oh, this will add to my next reading project : Machiavelli) "

"440",439,"Moya Miller","This book is not actually a story but a book about strategies of war and today sun Tzu's strategies are used in everyday life mostly in businesses. Sun Tzu was a military genius, he was a military general, strategist and philosopher in China around 500bc. The Art of War was a book attributed to Sun Tzu. People look to this book so that they can learn how to be powerful in businesses, sports, war games, people easily uses Sun Tzu's strategies in the modern world. The book portrays Sun Tzu's principles about war. It tells the readers of necessary tactics that people should consider before even attempting war. The book establishes how a person or a force has to make plans of their attack, make estimation and figure out the way in which they will attack, where will the fighting take place and most importantly who will lead them in battle. After all the army is as strong as it's leader and is as weak as it's weakest link. By thinking about these points a general can calculate his army's chances of winning. The book also says that armies should attack by stratagem. Making plans that you are always one step ahead of their enemy. The book explains how the army can use enemy weakness against him and how an army must appear to be weak so that the enemy will never expect what really is coming.. Sun Tzu also said the uses of spies is very essential in war, and that they are many types of spies, the most useful ones were the converted spies. Spies of the enemy that an army makes their own. This book, though not as interesting as others to have characters and plot, but it is interesting enough because many wishes to know about military strategies. Sun Tzu talks about how the use of energy and forces in the right way can aid someone in battle. Also advises how the types of terrains the army decide to fight on can determine the winner of the battle before it has even begun. Weak points and strong points of the enemy are things that could be used to the army's advantage. Sun Tzu makes it clear that using a variety in tactics makes the enemy unaware of their next move and it makes it hard for the enemy to predict what the army will do next. This book is not only used for military purposes but also used in the political and business arena. In the opinion of many this book is very intriguing and it helps people to understand more about war and surprisingly more about people and how they think. "
"441",440,"Marc Udoff","An interesting book for both the time it was written and its continuing cultural references. Glad I read it, but it wasn't that great as I am not leading an army/company.

I still don't dislike this book because i took many days to just thinking of the applications of the book and was picturing it entirely on the back of my mind but I had to listen each chapter 3 to 4 times.Over all, I would not recommend you to read this book before you read the applications of the book.Once you are done reading the application then you will have natural curiosity of what was the original book, what was it like.

Not a long book, but an interesting book. Thought provoking. The original Chinese texts from the famed military strategist, Sun Tzu, have been translated into English, but they are not explained, so you have to interpret them as best you can; most are reasonably obvious, a few less so.

What Sun Tzu wrote nearly 2500 years ago about the strategies in wartime can be applied to any difficulty you may face - calculate your odds of winning, plan your attack, rest and refuel, identify your opponent's weak points, take advantage of your surroundings, and employ spies!

However, I would advise caution if you intend to approach this as anything other than a military treatise. After all, as one of the text's commentators (Zhang Yu) says, 'compassion and righteousness are the principles on which to govern a state, but not an army'. In other words, there are distinctions to be drawn regarding the circumstances and environments in which the principles expounded by Sun Tzu are to be practised.We are repeatedly told that war is about deceit. It's about deceiving the enemy, in order to manipulate him, but it's also about deceiving your own troops. The skilful warrior 'leads his men into battle like a man climbing a height and kicking away the ladder.' He doesn't trust ordinary courage or resolve; he puts his men in mortal peril in order to bring the best out of them.Undoubtedly, Sun Tzu was a man of principle, and many of his principles were noble - he opens the book by calling war 'a grave affair of state', and absolutely believed that it was a last resort. The Art of War is about how to achieve victory in conflict once all other options have been exhausted, and it is for this reason that I hope its relevance and popularity suffer in the generations to come."

"599",598,"Shaun Marksbury","A Classic on WarfareBecause The Art of War earned its way into the “classics” category, surviving some 2,500 years and finding a favored spot on the bookshelves of Napoleon Bonaparte and many a critic and pop-culture writer, it’s a must-read for students, those preparing for warfare, and the rest of us living our daily lives. Though the book explicitly states that it is for the battlefield, we all need to remember those who see us as potential targets in their campaigns of personal conquest. It’s Machiavellian-esque, and yet to fight and control is human nature. We need to recognize that in others so we can take steps to avoid them. When viewed from a spiritual perspective, it helps open our eyes to the schemes of the enemy—to be forewarned is to be forearmed. While Christians will want to be wary of adopting Taoist principles, Sun Tzu will give insights needed to prepare our minds for whatever lies ahead."

I was pleasantly surprised how the fundamentals of war, which have stood the test of 2,000 years, are echoed in our classrooms. I've listed below several quotes from Sun Tzu that I feel are particularly applicable to education:""So it is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you can win a hundred battles without a single loss. If you only know yourself, but not your opponent, you may win or may lose. If you know neither yourself nor your enemy, you will always endanger yourself.""""Management of many is the same as management of few. It is a matter of organization.""""A leader leads by example not by force.""""Too frequent rewards indicate that the general is at the end of his resources; too frequent punishments that he is in acute distress.""""Engage people with what they expect; it is what they are able to discern and confirms their projections. It settles them into predictable patterns of response, occupying their minds while you wait for the extraordinary moment — that which they cannot anticipate.""""The general who wins the battle makes many calculations in his temple before the battle is fought. The general who loses makes but few calculations beforehand.""""Opportunities multiply as they are seized."""

His strategies involved victory and defeat, what to expect and how to read behavior among other things. I liked how he wrote the reason for everything, and defined the different types of ground and terrain, and how to measure the competence of the generals and sovereigns.The edition I read is a short one with a big font and there are a lot of quotable quotes that could be applied not just in war, but everyday living."

"653",652,"Kylan Mitchell"," The ""Art of War"" is a strategy book that was put together by a clan of experts on arms and fighting. It is a guide to strategical success in battle. I did happen to like the book because if anything ever happens or the day ever comes to where I need to know strategy or outsmart foe that I might be able to. The best part of the book was perhaps Chapter II on waging war. It was very interesting and when you watch a war movie you start to recognize the losers mistakes or what the winner could do to win. the worst part was the beginning of the book because it contained a whole preface-like duplicate of every chapter that was soon to come. Going into the book I expected it to not have as big of a preface and it to be easier to understand. I knew it would have bullet points but I thought that it would be more of a philosophical type book which I was glad it was not. It was not what I expected it to be though because it was more interesting and I had a little trouble understanding some of the language but I ended up getting it. Also not as much of the text was based on deciphering the hidden message as I thought. I would recommend this book to people with open minds who want to try new thing or who are interested in future careers in leading there own business, group, or military squads. "

So let me say up front, that if what you're looking for is just to read this classic work as an element of curiosity and personal expansion, as I was, that what you get in this Kindle edition, etext is just that. You get the text apparently as it was converted from another ebook format related to the Gutenburg project. All the words are there. As long as you're not picky about wanting your paragraphs and displays to be clean and as long as you don't have a need to be able to jump from an active Table of contents link or to easily reference the footnotes while you're reading than this copy will suffice.If however, you are a student or researcher and you have needs, then go ahead and look more carefully at the many other versions available on Kindle and pay the dollar or two or more to get a version that it more suited to your needs or you will be very frustrated with this particular copy.In terms of the text itself, this classic is worth reading for anyone who has an interest in things military, but also it has applications in the areas of leadership, business and dealing with change. The viewpoint is, of course, eastern and so in terms of tactics for today the use is limited. In terms of strategy however, and the ability to adapt, respond to and recognize that change in one or more elements of a situation may require a rejection of maxims and old paradigms in order to react and respond to a situation appropriately, this ancient text is amazingly well put together.If you're just looking to read this text one time for curiosity, you can't go very wrong with this public domain copy despite its rough appearance, lack of attention to detail, and lack of internal supporting links for effective use in the Kindle. If you're looking for anything more, then move on and leave this for the curiosity seekers.3 stars. The content is classic, the format in this Kindle edition is not.bart breen"

I mean, I got ""The military is a Tao of deception - Thus when able, manifest inability"" etc., but not a whole lot else. Shih? li? counting rods? Hwun-hwun dwun-dwun what? I was not expecting the cryptic quasi-verse. It didn't help that the first essays pointed out that different versions of the Sun Tzu (as it is called in Chinese) say the exact opposite of each other. It's either ""Defend and one is insufficient. Attack and one has a surplus."" or ""Defend and one has a surplus. Attack and one is insufficient."" Gee, thanks.It started making more sense when the essays in the middle pointed out that the anti-US forces in Vietnam and Iraq were basically applying principles from the Sun Tzu (ie be formless so they don't know how to attack you). Then the third part was a reprint of the text, with commentary, and that made more sense.What I got out of this was: know your enemy and know yourself. Know the terrain and use it to your advantage. Plunder your enemy to solve your own supply chain problems. Fake him out and do unexpected things. Have well-coordinated, loyal troops. People faced with death will fight hard. Use spies."

"729",728,"Mitchell Van Poecke","Nothing really new, inspirational, or innovative for the average person interested in strategy, tactics or military history, hence the 3 stars. However, this was written a good 2500 years ago and must be viewed in light of the emergence of large scale warfare as a new factor in politics. Conscription or large armies were not used before, and this posed all sorts of new logistical, strategical and tactical problems which had to be thought on and solved from the ground up. To us, Sun Tzu's wisdom might seem intuitive, obvious and extremely basic, but it is the clear and practical wording of these basic principles that gained Sun Tzu so much acclaim in his days and after and assured that his work survived over 2500 years of human history. This alone should attest for some of the contemporary importance of the book. "

One good thing about the book was the amount of wisdom and philosophy that was put into the book. One example of this was in the text it stated, “If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, the general is to blame"" (21). I really liked this quote because the figurative meaning is saying if your not a good leader than it is your fault when a mistake happens, making this quote relatable to life, not just in a military perspective. However, the thing that i didn't like about the book was the fact that the book lacked optimism. Simply put, this book was pretty boring in my opinion. It's mainly about a Chinese General and a person named Sun Tzu explaining the fundamentals and principles of advice for war. Which is not very intriguing or fun to read about. Therefore, these examples show why i think the book, ""The Art of War"" by Sun Tzu, is a good book. "

"769",768,"Muhammad Moneib","A Minimalist’s Guide to War and its ArtIf the world was ideal, nothing would go wrong. There would be no greed, there would be no injustice, and consequently, there would be no war. But we all know that reality is far from this utopian fantasy, as history has taught us over and over again that as long as there are human beings, there will be war. It is part of our inefficiencies; the submission of reason in front of strong emotions; the link to our animalistic origins that we couldn’t break, or perhaps don’t want to. Yet, the admission of such inevitability is not a call for submission, as it is a call for us, human beings, to strive for peace as much as we can, and only if we fail, if there’s no other options out there, then it it might be appropriate for us to practice the art of war.Sun Tzu was said to be born in an era of “Warring States” that witnessed interstate power struggles that divided China after the conclusion of what was called the “Spring and Autumn” period. These ongoing struggles had led to the negligence of the chivalric principles that were to be found in wars prior to this period. Such reality had affected Sun Tzu greatly and led him, as an experienced warrior, to have a realistic approach towards war, which he acknowledged the misery it can bring, and to advocate efficiency in what is presented as a minimalistic approach towards warfare.In order to achieve his goal of maximum efficiency, Master Sun starts his study of the art of war with the pre-war stage, the planning. He believes that in this stage the winner is determined, and that’s why war can be avoided altogether if the warring parties make their calculations correctly. He presents five ways to be considered in the calculations: the Way (relation between the ruler and the people), the weather, the terrain, leadership, and management, with the ordering showing the precedence of each factor with respect to the one that follows it.If the calculations are made and the civilian leadership along with its military advisors decide to go to battle, cost then must be there first priority according to Master Sun. This is because an ongoing war can render a rich nation poor. Here, the concept of maximum efficiency shows that war must be exerted only as a matter of necessity, a last resort, not as a result of anger or wrath or greed as it is the case with most wars.One of the main themes of Art of War is that the skilled warrior is the most efficient one who wins without much of fighting. This rule and many others in the book are extracted from the old traditions of martial arts, but they apply as well to warfare. The pursuit of a decisive victory should not be a hasty one though. Instead, Master Sun cites five factors that determine the winner on the ground: attack, strategy, alliances, army, and cities. The last factors has to do with the inefficiency of long sieges.It is evident throughout the book that Sun Tzu was deeply affected by Taoism. The paradoxical ideas of winning by not fighting, as well as the basic premise of emptiness and fullness are all indicators to such an influence. One of the ideas reiterated in many chapters is that of formlessness. Formations can leak patterns of strategy that can be used by the enemy, and while they are essential for a strong army, they must be concealed by formlessness, so as to deceive the adversaries. As for the unity of the army, it is achieved through momentum, by making all individuals of different skills act in harmony and synchronicity as if as one. Together, formations and momentum can fill the gaps within an army, thus making it less empty and more full.Just like formlessness, maneuvering and spying are other forms of deception in war advocated by Master Sun. Maneuvering is about tricking the opponent, showing him an opportunity of gain that will expose him for an attack. Spying is about the use of intelligence to get access to his concealed information. Master Sun lists five classes of spies: local spies, inward spies (insiders), converted spies (renegades), dead spies (false prophets), and living spies. Of all these, the most important class is the converted spies, as they open the door for easily accessing local and inward spies, managing living spies, and using dead spies.Deception is usually used to invoke the enemy to take a certain action. Expecting the enemy’s actions, on the other hand, is called anticipation. This skill is essential to avoid surprises and limit losses. Just like a martial artist would duck a kick after anticipating it, a good leader could spare his army moral and material loss if he anticipates the enemy’s moves correctly. A correct anticipation would render the enemy’s deceptive measures futile.Master Sun’s advice on anticipation is based on the concept of adaptation with the changes of the enemy. Another very important form of adaptation is that of situations, or as he puts it, the “nine terrains.” Each of these terrains is a situation that requires a certain way of dealing with it. Contented ground, for instance, should not be attacked; on an intersecting ground alliances should be made; on a dead ground there’s no other choice but to fight.The use of weapons is not mentioned until the very last chapters of Art of War. This conforms well with Sun Tzu’s conviction that weapons are “instruments of ill omen” to be used only when necessary. He elaborates on this point by saying, “Anger can revert to joy, wrath can revert to delight, but a nation destroyed cannot be restored to existence, and the dead cannot be restored to life.”Many of the advices in the book, especially about deception, were considered a break from the confucian traditions and the code of chivalry. Some may also be at odds with our modern perception of human rights. For Sun Tzu, soldiers are clearly tools, albeit ones that should be treated well and respected. Their role is only to fight, not to understand. Yet, that doesn’t sound a lot different from modern warfare. In fact, I have found Sun Tzu’s insistence of a just, yet strict, reward and punishment system for soldiers, and his minimalistic approach towards warfare to be much more humane than what we witness these days. Apparently, the Art of War should be read and studied more in today’s political circles.Despite its name, many modern readers and writers are using this book in teaching management. It is not easy to find the connection between the two disciplines of business and war in the context of Sun Tzu’s writing, but there are some common elements, especially about the relation between the soldiers and their leaders and the preparation for war. The nine terrains concept can be used metaphorically in some way, but I can’t see any use for the types of spies or the use of weapons in the world of business unless for malicious actions!The text written by Sun Tzu is deliberately vague and concise, which can be irritating and surprising at sometimes given the place it occupies in both history and popular culture. That’s why it is usually accompanied by the commentary of some of the historic strategists of the far east. The difference in interpretations is evidently stark in many cases, which proves that any reading of the Art of War is a subjective experience. This makes it more like poetry or a scripture than a textbook. And just as chess is an abstraction of war in the form of a game, the Art of War is nothing more than an abstraction of the art of doing warfare with maximum efficiency in the form of a book."
"771",770,"Carolyn","This book was good, and had a lot of practical advice for war, relationships, and gardening. Pick a nice sunny spot for those hydrangeas now. But man, after the first 20 or so pages I was a little bored/frustrated. So many foot notes explaining things that were reaaaally obvious and didn't warrant the foot note. Frankly, I'm not a great fan of foot notes I like to immerse myself in what I'm reading, but if a foot note is there I feel like I *have* to read the foot note and it pulls me out of the moment in the book. I liked all the little added stories that emphasized what Sun Tzu was saying, I think they were added by commentators over the years but they were interesting and I noticed that many people were beheaded in ancient China. That seemed to be a popular thing back in those days. It's a solid book it drags a little here and there, but generally a good read."

"788",787,"Alif Fikri","I was reading this book a few years ago. Before I read this book, I heard about Sun Tzu (in English means: Master Sun) and his theory, especially for military interest/ war. And oftenly I also heard some business management expert apply his theory on modern business and management. And for this aspects, there are so many books wrote by them.But one of an interesting aspects of this book is so 'classic'. Its written a pure theory of Sun Tzu on war. Roger T. Ames translated all of original manuscript of Sun Tzu's book to this book. So, it's very original and classical. If we read this book, we will get an atmosphere as likely we are one of the army that under Sun Tzu's order in war. And (for me, especially) that's an exiting one.But don't worry for whom that don't know about Sun Tzu's profile, this book also explaining who was Sun Tzu, including some debate of a few another 'Sun Tzu'.

The general who loses makes but few calculations beforehand.The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.The enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution.Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.Quickness is the essence of the war.Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance.Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster.Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories.Invincibility lies in the defense; the possibility of victory in the attack.If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results of a hundred battles.He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot, will be victorious.He who is prudent and lies in wait for an enemy who is not, will be victorious.Confront them with annihilation, and they will then survive; plunge them into a deadly situation, and they will then live. When people fall into danger, they are then able to strive for victory.Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious, even to the point of soundlessness. Thereby you can be the director of the opponent's fate.All men can see these tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved."

"861",860,"Matt Goldstein","Simply put, it's as thought provoking as it is cryptic. It's extremely difficult to read the advice that Sun Tsu gave, because much of it is is told in metaphor, making it a stressful read. But it does contain many (at the time) revolutionary concepts, both in terms of actually conducting an actual war and evaluating it in terms of a strictly objective based approach. In this way, it's a useful read for people who want to know about chinese military history or want to gleam a small look into the effects that civil wars had on early chinese civilization. For other people, it will probably be more trouble than it's worth to read it because of the aforementioned stylistic issues. Despite it's small size as a work, it could take a while to read, if your edition has lots of sidetones and back story info into the wars and times that necessitated such a book in the first place. This is probably the best way to read it, because otherwise it's just an outdated military essay on better overall doctrine that's written in almost comically stereotypical language that you'd expect a drunken kungfu artist to say, involving such references as the 5 chinese elements (fire, water, earth, metal, and trees), for example. If you don't already have some knowledge of classical chinese beliefs and culture, then the book may be simply unreadable in parts.In summation, it's a very important work for historical reasons, but it's not light or enjoyable reading. This is a book for sinologists, pretty much in exclusion to everyone else. "

"891",890,"Kevin Holsters","J’avais envie de lire ce petit essai sur la guerre pour changer de genre. Ce titre m’avait aussi fort intrigué dans le passé et je n’avais jamais su le lire entièrement. Prenant mon courage et ma volonté à deux mains, j’ai enfin lu cet ouvrage chinois classique, cet essai sur la stratégie de guerre et je vous offre, aujourd’hui, mon appréciation dessus. Tout d’abord, j’ai très apprécié le stratège qu’était Sun Tzu. Dans les articles décrits dans le livre, nous voyons toute la stratégie et la réflexion qu’il y a derrière les mots. Pour apprécier tout ce qui est écrit, nous devons nous immerger dans le passé, trois siècles avant le nôtre, lorsque les moyens militaires étaient très réduits comparés à maintenant. Une fois notre esprit acclimaté à cette époque, nous pouvons vivre ce que ce général de l’armée chinoise nous dévoile et nous pouvons observer toute la finesse d’esprit de cet homme de guerre qui, par expérience et par réflexion, nous dévoile une manière de se battre qui, dans le passé et encore aujourd’hui, était révolutionnaire et synonyme de victoire. En effet, nous ne pouvons douter de la victoire d’une patrie qui utilisait cette stratégie, tout est bien réfléchi et gagner, si la stratégie est appliquée correctement, est la suite logique de l’histoire. Nous sommes un peu comme dans une recette. Nous avons les ingrédients et la préparation devant nous. Le bête type qui suivra la recette mot pour mot aura une chance sur cinq de réussir la recette tandis que celui qui variera un peu la dose des ingrédients aura plus de chances. Maintenant, si on ne suit pas la recette, nous allons perdre, à moins d’être un bon cuisinier, un excellent général de guerre. Certaines recettes donnent des bons gâteaux et d’autres donnent des gâteaux encore meilleurs, quelle victoire allez-vous choisir ? De plus, Sun Tzu est un très bon pédagogue et explique clairement sa technique de guerre sans que le lecteur soit désavantagé à cause de son non-expérience dans la stratégie militaire. Expliquer l’art de la guerre à des civils qui ne se sont jamais intéressés à la guerre est un défi que notre général asiatique a relevé et a réussi. Ce n’est jamais évident d’expliquer son métier, l’art de son métier à quelqu’un qui a des préjugés dessus ou qui n’y connaît rien. Pour lui faire comprendre, nous devons exceller dans notre fonction pour lui expliquer le plus clairement possible. Ce général devait être une grande étoile dans l’art militaire car je n’ai eu aucune difficulté à comprendre sa stratégie et à avoir un tableau d’ensemble. Je suis dans des études de comptabilité et quand j’essaye d’expliquer ce qu’est le métier de comptable, j’observe beaucoup de préjugés comme quoi la comptabilité sont des mathématiques par exemple et je peux vous dire que c’est faux. Oui, il y’a une part de calculs mais la plupart se font automatiquement avec Excel ou les logiciels comptables. Chaque métier a son art, chaque fonction a son but et chaque personne de métier ne peut être pédagogue. C’est ainsi que j’ai été impressionné par la facilité de compréhension de cet essai sur la stratégie militaire. Pour terminer, certaines parties de ce livre pour ne pas dire toutes peuvent être interprétés pour une guerre plus diplomatique ou spirituelle. Une guerre n’est pas que des combats sanglants en corps-à-corps mais cela peut-être également en politique ou entre deux partis qui se livrent la guerre à coups de circulaires et de lois. Cela peut également être un combat intérieur que se livre une personne dans un changement de situation, une réflexion sur lui-même, une mise au point sur elle-même. C’est parfois assez dur de trouver le sens moral des mots car à la base, ce livre n’est pas écrit pour ce genre de situations mais bien pour la vraie guerre. Néanmoins, nous savons considérer les propos de l’auteur avec plus de sens sous-entendu si on se concentre et qu’on se creuse les méninges. Nous sommes dans une théorie qui nous pousse à affronter le problème et non à le laisser derrière nous ou en nous. C’est une façon de penser que je prône et que je trouve peu agressive mais très efficace. Nous analysons le problème et modifions ses composantes pour en faire un problème. C’est moins violent que d’affronter le problème à âme perdue. Je pense vraiment que c’est intéressant de réfléchir au sens profond des mots, de la stratégie décrite dans ce livre. En conclusion, j’ai assez bien aimé ce livre pour un essai militaire et je recommande ce bouquin aux intéressés.http://leslecturesdekevin.blogspot.be..."

If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained, you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle...by Sun Tzu, a philosopher and a great general!"
"918",917,"Brenna","Another good audio-book for falling asleep too. It was a tad strange listening to an Irishman read this since I've so long associated it with Asian culture, but Mr. Gillen did a really excellent job keeping fairly dry subject matter interesting. It's a pretty fascinating study of conflict. I knew very little about it beyond the title and the fact the author was an ancient Chinese philosopher of sorts, thus was pleasantly surprised to find the emphasis in his discussions of ""war"" and conflict is victory without conflict or bloodshed. And his arguments are as straightforward as they are compelling. I surprised myself with how much I enjoyed this one. "

"940",939,"Salymar","This book was recommended by my Professor in World Politics.I found this book fascinating because it unlocks the secret behind the strategies of power on different wars fought in the world.Sun Tzu emphasized the importance of positioning in military strategy. The decision to position an army must be based on both objective conditions in the physical environment and the subjective beliefs of other, competitive actors in that environment. He thought that strategy was not planning in the sense of working through an established list, but rather that it requires quick and appropriate responses to changing conditions. Planning works in a controlled environment; but in a changing environment, competing plans collide, creating unexpected situations."

Li pensando estar numa China de 2000 anos A.C., naquele tempo no qual os generais e samurais reinavam na guerra, como os filmes desse gênero que passam nos cinemas. Algumas passagens são bem óbias como as dicas de que é melhor evitar a guerra ou que quanto mais longa pior. Isso nós podemos traduzir para as relações de liderança do mundo corporativo, mas dicas como não subir um vale para atacar um inimigo ou evitar pântanos no meio do caminho ficam um pouco difíceis de tentar decifrar.Não consegui traduzir muitas “dicas” nessa leitura. Talvez por ter lido como lazer e não ter parado para refletir nesses “ensinamentos”. Dica: nessa versão, ao final do livro, tem algumas páginas para você fazer as suas anotações.

"971",970,"Aubrey Amundson","I would summarize the message of this book through two quotes that I believe illustrate its uses and limits. The first: “Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat”, and the second: “If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.”The first quote is simply wisdom, aptly put, and the second is humanism mixed with some form of ancient Eastern paganism, complete with four winds and various mystic signs that reveal the orthodoxy behind Sun Tzu’s strategy and necessarily affect the validity of his reasoning. So far as his practical wisdom and foresight are consistent with principles found in Scripture (e.g. Proverbs, Joshua, Judges, etc.) so far are his precepts an excellent tool in working out life strategy to be more effective for God’s Kingdom. Sun Tzu places an emphasis on fighting with a plan for victory; an essential doctrine that has been lost in many Christian circles today. Christ the King has already won the victory and will remain victorious to the end, and the church’s attitude in battle strategy should reflect this. Sun Tzu also describes the victor as one who “compels men and is not compelled by other men.” This is consistent with the Scriptural blessing of being the “head and not the tail” found in Deuteronomy 28:13. His reasoning, because it is not Christian, is inherently flawed. However, generally speaking, he advocates selflessness, perception, watchfulness, diligence, self-control, patience, discipline, mercy, the preservation of life, and prudence, all essentially Christian virtues laid out practically for more thorough application in our lives.

"980",979,"Bookworm Sean","We all know one person who has an answer for everything. This person is usually annoying and won’t accept that sometimes they’re just wrong; they won’t accept that at some point their logic may fail them and run dry; they’re completely resolute in what they believe and they just won’t budge from it: they simply can’t be proven wrong or at fault. This is how I feel about Sun Tzu. It’s like he interpreted questions and doubts before they were born, and countered them with his own logic based responses that felt immaculately persuasive to the point that I found them to be convincing truths. Sun Tzu, literally, has an answer for everything war based. How to win at war  I could never consider war as a form of art, but Sun Tzu has provided a detailed manual of how to survive it. Well, at least if you’re a general in the command of legions of armies and have the ability to respond to a multitude of situations with the quick thinking advice of Sun Tzu. Then, and only then, might you be ok. If you’re a foot solider or a random underling, then you’re screwed because you’d most likely be spent in some well thought out attack or defensive manoeuvre. This book is certainly one for the generals who must consider victory first and overcome the loss of human life. There’s a reason why this book is still read today by military leaders, soldiers and random bookworms; it provides valuable insight on how to master the battlefield; it advises the reader on how to respond, in the most effective manner, to a number of tactical situations. There is so much covered in this relatively small book that it’s quite surprising. However, despite the convincing nature of his arguments, I do feel like there would be a situation where his logic failed him. There will be a situation where an unforeseeable circumstance defeats his approach and leads in an unexpected defeat and complete rout. No manual of war could ever be completely extensive even if it appears that way. But, don’t tell Sun Tzu I said that because he’d have an answer. Easy to read One thing that struck me when reading this was the sheer approachability of it. I expected it to be very complex and intricate. The manoeuvres and counters are conveyed in a simple, yet comprehensive, manner. It undeniably makes war look easy, which it obviously isn’t. I’m not saying that it’s misleading, but I was just looking for a logic hole in here. I was unable to find one, though I think if someone used this in war they may find it. I am glad of the simplicity of it, though, because it made the book very approachable and easy to understand. I never thought I’d say this, but  The Art of War  is very light reading. This was such an interesting book to read. I feel like I learnt a lot from it, which is quite scary really. Perhaps, I won’t read it a second time, as I don’t want to get to many ideas in my head. I do recommend giving this book a read though, just for the sake of reading something completely different.  A tactical three stars  "

"986",985,"Les Chroniques Aléatoires","L’Art de la Guerre est un de ces rares livres que même 2500 ans plus tard reste d’actualité… il suffit de changer certains termes et on aurait l’impression d’avoir un écrit philosophique contemporain, c’est assez troublant. Évidemment dès qu’on touche à la philosophie, la lecture devient tout de suite plus compliqué et on a envie d’abandonner pour ne pas se prendre la tête. Mais le livre est suffisamment court pour que ce ne soit pas le cas.Les points abordés et développés sont assez simple : ne jamais abandonné, tout donné, être prêt à tout pour réussir, bien observé ce qui nous entoure avant d’agir, de ne pas laisser ses sentiments intervenir et en dernier point, de connaître aussi bien ses points forts que ces points faibles. Dit comme ça, on dirait vraiment que je parle d’un livre pleins de conseils, un espèce de ""Confiance en soit pour les Nuls"". Il y a pas mal de conseils, mais les conseils en question sont à décrypter entre les lignes et surtout on doit y réfléchir pour les comprendre.Ce texte est l’une des pièces charnières du taoïsme, souvent utilisé par les Grands de l’Histoire, et pas uniquement les Sages ou Généraux asiatiques.Napoléon est très connu pour sa passion de ce livre qui l’a énormément aidé pendant ses différentes campagnes. L’Art de la Guerre est tel que le dit son titre, un écrit sur la guerre, ses stratégies et utilisation de diplomatie, ruses ou tricheries. Il est donc normal que les militaires de tout temps aime s’y référer.Néanmoins il ne faut pas oublié que Sun Tzu était un peu comme un Gandhi dans son époque. Il était contre la guerre, il voulait que les guerres disparaissent et que les gens utilise la diplomatie à la place des armes. Il a écrit ce livre pour prévenir les conflits et aider à y mettre fin, mais malheureusement tout cela a été détourné pour d’autres buts. En tout cas, l’Art de la Guerre se lit facilement et rapidement, et on en retire certaines choses même de nos jours !"

"989",988,"Carla","I've heard this book described as a must-read for modern day corporate and leadership strategy. I don't really get it. I think the historical viewpoint is more valuable than present day applications. There is a small amount of advice that pertains to modern day leadership, such as: ""If soldiers are punished before a personal attachment to the leadership is formed, they will not submit, and if they do not submit they are hard to employ.""However, much of its content is specific to warfare 2500 years ago, which makes sense, as this was its purpose. For example:""If birds start up, there are ambushers there; if animals are frightened there are attackers there."" This is literal advice about the behaviour of animals, there is no double meaning. Sure, you could make analogies to modern day life, but then you are the one coming up with the advice, making it fit the text, not gleaning words of wisdom from Master Sun.Lastly, what disappointed me was how so much of it was just common sense, and plain obvious. ""Attack when they are unprepared, make your move when they do not expect it."" and ""The formation and procedure used by the military should not be divulged beforehand"". Duh."
"991",990,"Rina","I feel so indifferent about this book. I think the version has something to do with that. It turned out that the version was more of a collective interpretation than the actual translated text of the Art of War. There were disjointed excerpts from Sun Tzu in each chapter, followed by one or more interpretations/commentaries/expansions from 12 other authors. At first, I found it interesting because it provided insight, but then it felt like a lot of repetition in slightly different wording. I just wanted to read Sun Tzu's actual text and the excerpts don't flow together.As far as the actual text I did get to read, I think it was just what I expected. It was very literally about war, but you could make it a metaphor that applied to other things as well. Being that I'm not particularly into books about war, military history, Chinese history, Chinese military history, strategy, or any combination thereof, it was just okay to me. I did like skimming the translator's introduction as it provided important context about why Sun Tzu might be so anti-war in a book seemingly about war.Maybe one day I'll read the full actual text, but this version didn't make me exactly excited to do so."

Some of the stories of how battles were won using the strategies the book discusses was entertaining. It really came down to a formatting issue. Giles should have saved his commentary for the end of every chapter instead of using it to break up sentences. The actual content by Sun Tzu was amazing and profound. I kept thinking of how this would apply to current warfare with tanks and drones. Most of it still applies as the book is more about mindset than battlefield tactics. "

"1035",1034,"Kristy Musgrove","The Art Of War was written in the 6th Century BC by the Chinese general Sun Tzu. The treatise covers many subjects ranging from evaluating terrain to the use of spies. I expected the book to be long and technical but there are only 13 chapters and the writing is very clear and concise. Despite being many thousands of years old and translated from Chinese the writing is not mystical or “poetic” and can be easy understood by any modern reader.Although The Art Of War is a military treatise, the teachings and guidelines laid out within in it can be applied to many situations in modern life. If taken to heart, the lessons learned from reading the work builds confidence and patience in the reader making them more prepared to “conquer” whatever obstacles are in their way. My favorite quote from Sun Tzu’s The Art Of War is “Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win”. This sums up the reoccurring theme in the writing that winning a war (or problem solving) is done in the planning. Sun Tzu basically teaches that one must pause and consider a problem (or enemy) from all angles and plan according to what advantages and disadvantages one may have.This is a book that every professional in the workforce should read no matter what their field of expertise. The basic blue print for solving almost any problem is explained in the strategies and tactics taught by Sun Tzu."

I'm paraphrasing, but that's the gist of it. It's a bit awesome that it was written so long ago and still, human nature being what it is, applies. Sun Tzu knew the value of wisdom and leadership, and he also had a great faith in loyalty (that I can't help but view with a bit of cynisism, people are far to egosistical nowadays to lay down their lives when a general snaps his fingers) that makes this book an interesting read."

It was nice because it strangely taught me a lot about life's problems just hardships in general, which let me connect with it on a philosophical level. On the downsides of the book, I didn't enjoy it mostly for the reason of it being a high level of reading, and because it was written before Christ was born. Sun Tzu was a Chinese military general who wrote this around 2000 B.C. which made the vocabulary and translations very odd.

Some are specific for ancient warfare while other also applies to current warfare. I.e. the rule that the general should make decisions on the battlefield and not the ruler as often seen during WW2 in Germany and Russia.It emphasizes some interesting ideas, such as surprising the enemy as well as the effect of putting soldiers in position where they have no (percieved) option but to fight to the death."
"1072",1071,"Macire' Daffe'"," The Art of War by Sun Tzu is a book about strategy. A book about overcoming obstacles wisely and efficiently. It teaches you an understanding of conflict and also teaches you how to overcome everyday competition. I gave the art of war a 3 out of 5 because it was interesting but it wasn't my type of book. I prefer fantasy and sci-fi over other types of genres. I found this book really interesting though. After reading the book that was recommended to me a couple of times i decided to read it. It immediately struck me how dense this book is. A lot of the information given was clear and understandable, but every page you read makes you think deeply about what was read. On one part I found myself trying to figure out what kind of weather would be best for a battle. I usually never think of things like that. I see how this can be applied to everyday ""battles"" but i think i might have to either broaden my reading horizons a bit or just wait till i am older to really understand and value this book.

"1074",1073,"Kristiina","As historical how-to books go, this one is right up there. However, beware that after you read it, you might start looking for ways to attack your co-worker, boss, or possible strangers on the street. You will look at war movies with a bit more scrutiny, knowing that if you were the general you would attack from the rear while distracting the opposition from the east. All this knowledge I obtained is pretty useless in the early childhood education life, but perhaps some day I can use Sun Tsz's strategies during a rousing game of chase at recess."

"1085",1084,"Alleydancer07","The short script was an interesting insight into the mind of a tactical thinker; there were many small gems of wisdom that could be gleaned from it. I found the overly lengthy introduction and the footnotes tedious, mostly because I am not very interested in ancient Chinese warfare and weaponry; though there were certainly references to such in the original text, I don't think it warranted the need for an introduction that was twice the length of the script by Sun Tzu himself. Worth reading for sure, but unless one has a jonesin for the history of the Zhou dynasty or the Warring States period, I'd avoid getting bogged down in the introduction."

The Art of War by Sun Tzu was written long before the middle ages and still holds its value today. This narrative gives the basic conceptions of war in a general, logical, decisive and simple way. Basically it relays to the reader when to stand and when to hide; when to attack and when to retreat. This has been one of the most basic books studied by almost all of the great military leaders through time. It isn’t very exciting as books go but does contain much helpful information.

"1111",1110,"Seth Skorkowsky","The Art of War is one of those classics that everyone knows about, but few ever read. Donald Trump swears by it. I remember Wesley Snipes reading it in Passenger 57, and you just know he’s going to be a total badass because only a total badass would read such a badass book (Later he appeared in the movie version of The Art of War, which I found to be a very poor adaptation of Sun Tzu’s masterpiece.)Joking aside, I’ve always wanted to read this book because of its reputation. It’s 2,500 years old, so while the practicalities of the actual warfare are very dated, what makes the book valuable is Sun Tzu’s thoughts on psychology, namely mind-games, and breaking/encouraging troop morale. Those principals and philosophies on leadership are just as true today as they’ve always been.As far as the actual warfare, most of it seems like it would still be quite valid. I saw some reviews stating, “This is all useless now that we have nukes.” But since the last war-time nuke was used nearly 70 years ago, and there’s been many wars since then, I’m going to say that they’re wrong.The book is brimming with little tidbits and quotable lines of wisdom. It’s about 120 pages long. The Goodreads list of memorable quotes is 12 pages. That averages at about 3 juicy quotes per page. I think you’d be hard pressed to find a non-religious text that averages that many memorable quotes.Recommended. Doubly so for anyone planning on going to war with either Wesley Snipes or Donald Trump."

"1139",1138,"Kenneth Shu","The Art of WarIt’s not the type of book you find an average adolescent child reading for recreation, but it sure is one of great intrigue and sage. The Art of War by warmonger Sun Tze is an anthology of stories and accounts that educate the reader on the basis of war and strategy. From utilizing intricate battle formations and approaches to simply where to set one’s base camp, this book covers nearly all aspects of war, war that involved cavalry and swords not automated firearms and artillery strikes. I personally enjoy this book not because of its convoluting wording or classical meaning, but because I can apply this to modern contexts. The Art of War has grown obsolete in modern warfare, soldiers nowadays no longer use sticks and stones to win wars. With rapidly advancing technological prowess, the principles set by Sun Tze have become antiquated and derelict in war, yet that doesn’t mean that one can’t apply those principles to routines such as telling your mother that you failed your examinations to asking someone out to dinner. Sure the art of war was a modicum too recondite and confusing, but it sure is a classic that most people should read for sheer recreation and education."

"1174",1173,"Mj Alves","I first heard about this book along time ago and it has always popped up wherever I went but I never really decided to read it. I heard that this book was like a legend and that a lot of great figures in our history had read it. During my phase in the fourth grade in where I wanted to be a war lord, I looked up to Sun Tzu, he seemed like a super cool guy and his book was popular. I hated reading back then so and I never got past anything that wasn't Calvin and Hobbes.When my English Teacher let us read any book we wanted I decided to choose this book. I didn't really know what it was going to be about. I thought it was going to be a regular fiction book such as harry potter or something like that with a main character, setting and a plot. When I did research on it I thought I had been wrong. The book appeared to be guidelines, it was just simply a book on what to do if you are a warlord. The more I got into the book realized that it did have characters, a setting and a plot. I interpret as advice to me personally. I became the main character, the setting became wherever I am and the plot was whatever was going on in my life. This book should be read with an open mind and the reader should picture themselves in the book. Reading the Art of war was so enjoyable because I was able to interpret the book anyway I wanted it. Even the way it was written was my choice. The style and mood of the book was what ever I wanted it to be or however I was feeling in the moment. I found some parts of the book irrelevant and skipped over them. This book should not be read quickly and is the right length. My favorite part of the book was that it had one theme that is war but it applied to everything that is going on around me. This book like looking into a mirror but also is like learning a lesson. "

That said - it was a simple book to breeze through and doing so has alleviated any anxieties that I might have in future seeing something quoted from it."
"1185",1184,"Oliver","Written around 500 BC, this book lays down what’s critical in engaging in war: KNOWLEDGE. In a period when war was imminent since men’s egocentricism was tightly sealed by limited information about the world in total, it was imperative among states to build their armies (actually, it still is). Everything else constant (size of army, battlefield, natural elements, weapons, supplies, purpose etc.), there’s only one thing left that the good general could control, and that is knowledge – knowledge of own army, the enemy, the topography, elements, deception, subtlety, resources and a lot of things.The nice thing about this book is that some of the verses could actually be picked out and disassociated from war itself. And those could independently make a good sense about managing situations and calculating actions. When read at a different perspective, one could zoom it off both the military point of view and Ancient Chinese era."

With the sun on my back.""The Art of War"" is a very interesting book, specially because of its fame and the influence it has had in the way wars had been fought or look at. Sun Tzu (or the parts that he wrote) makes some interesting affirmations (take care of your soldiers as if they were your children, give them spoils of war) that make absolute sense and that show a deep understanding of the human psyche. That he also gives interesting information about terrains and about taking care of supplies or spies is also very interesting. We see how people understood war, and we learn a little bit about how generals may think.On the other hand, it all is very vague. Sometimes, he just says something like: the general should have information about his enemy, or press your enemy if he is resting, or make them believe what you are not... without getting into much detail or telling you what to do if your enemy is also a master of deceive. And it is also a little bit repetitive.I know the nine types of terrain, though, so my neighbor should be scared of when the weather is very dry, as I may try to burn his stores.6,5"

"1224",1223,"Alex Laldin","War is conflict, and throughout life one will face many obstacles and conflicts. One’s ultimate success is determined by the way in which they react to life’s curveballs. “The Art of War” was written over 2,500 years ago by a brilliant wartime strategist by the name of Sun Tzu. The work consists of various lessons in relation to wartime strategy that have been used by some of history’s greatest military strategists. Strategists such as Napolean, Erwin Rommel, and perhaps most fitting Mao Zedong have all applied these strategies to their military campaigns; however Sun Tzu’s lessons can also be applied to everyday life. This fact being ultimately why it is still relevant in today’s times. In fact there are many lectures and seminars put on for corporations, politicians, etc. to elaborate on how to apply these strategies to the business world. 	Sun Tzu breaks the book down into various elements that when combined lead to some form of victory; elements such as methodology, leadership, and ethics. A majority of the work focuses on leadership and what qualities a leader should exemplify. “Leadership is a matter of intelligence, trustworthiness, humanness, courage, and sternness.” While individually Sun Tzu’s lessons are simple and almost commonsense, together they come to forge a pathway to overcome any confrontation one may face, whether in the boardroom or on the battlefield. 	Personally I walked away from reading the work with a better understanding of how to deal with people and conflict from a leadership position. The lessons taught can be applied to anything by anyone making it a perfect read for just about anyone, but particularly those who find themselves in leadership roles. "

"1228",1227,"Jan Pruce","A functional translationThe meaning is preserved, but sadly it's beauty is somewhat diminished by wordy translations and comments. Nothing is left out, however. It's similar to the comparison of a study bible to the King James version.Compare the following examples and you'll see what I mean:Bob Sutton (?) translation (this book):""1. In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.[The equivalent to an army corps, according to Ssu-ma Fa, consisted nominally of 12500 men; according to Ts`ao Kung, the equivalent of a regiment contained 500 men, the equivalent to a detachment consists from any number between 100 and 500, and the equivalent of a company contains from 5 to 100 men. For the last two, however, Chang Yu gives the exact figures of 100 and 5 respectively.]"" (III - Attack by Strategem)Samuel B. Griffith, Oxford University translation: ""1. Generally in war the best policy is to take the state intact; to ruin it is inferior to this. Li Ch'uan: Do not put a premium on killing."" (III- Offensive Strategy)Both of these segments are the same verse, yet the latter states it much more succinctly. Taste and opinions may differ, but I prefer the Oxford translation over this one."

It also talks about the waging war that was taking place at the time. Sun Tzu thinks that it is quite useless to fight so we shouldn't do it. He organized many military strategies and wrote the book, ""the art of war"" many years ago."
"1259",1258,"Ashley *Hufflepuff Kitten*","Buddy read with Anuradha!Sorry, this wasn't much of a buddy read, was it? We'll have to do another one, a proper one sometime. Let me explain.This audiobook wound up in my collection (I think) when a friend left it along with a bunch of DVDs after he'd been living with us for awhile, and I just sort of absconded with it. Joe Mantegna reads, which made me happy (being the Criminal Minds nut that I am). The audiobook has four discs, but the book itself only takes up about a disc and a half of that space, if that. The rest is supplemental material, which I really don't care about. I think the only reason this gets 3 stars is because it's a classic and in my very humble reader's opinion, ought to be compulsory reading material for anyone in the military. A lot of common sense and quite a bit of repetition -- or if not repetition, then ""do this. don't do that."" and so forth. Seemed very straightforward.I'm glad I read it, but I'm also SO glad it only took me a few hours ;) Gonna donate this copy to the secondhand shop and send it along its merry little way."

"1265",1264,"Samantha Nicholson","The Art of War by Sun Tzu is a truly remarkable book written with a great sense of knowledge about how one can be successful while going into war. Even though some facts about war may be complicated; Sun Tzu allows the readers to look at it from a different perspective that seems to make even the most crucial aspects of war a simple type of art form. Everyone wants to win the wars that they are faced with; whether they are true wars or simply the wars they are encountered with in their everyday lives. I believe that The Art of War gives us the resources we need to be successful in the wars we face.One must have a good leader in order to be victorious. The leader must be aware of his people, and of the enemy. They must expect the un-expected and be prepared to use strategy and knowledge to overcome their successors. Sun Tzu is able to describe this type of leader in a very poetic and dignified manner.I believe that this type of leader is not only necessary in an actual battlefield, but also in sports and in the ruling of countries. I think that is an aspect of this book that is truly astonishing; we can put all of the information Sun Tzu gives us and apply them to our everyday lives. Especially when he refers to how one should not allow anger to overcome ourselves; because anger is like an emotion, one moment here and the next gone. However, those actions that we make based on our emotions are the ones that we cannot take back. I highly recommend this book to everyone, because I believe each individual can gain some type of knowledge from this book in an insightful way. "

It seemed like there would be no lesson or value for me personally for reading it, and so it never made it’s way to my to-read shelf. However, now that I have made my way through, I realize that this book is about so much more than war. It is about leadership and honor. Sun Tzu had so many wonderful principles for living by. “All war is based on deception.” Tzu conveys this maxim in many different ways throughout his treatise. The greatest generals are those who can create the stage for battle, without the enemy ever being aware a set-up is at hand. Tzu also lists the five characteristics of a great leader: “wisdom, sincerity, humanity, courage, and strictness.” These qualities of man are applicable to any position of power—perhaps, the most relevant being sincerity. “If sincere his men will have no doubt of the certainty of rewards and punishments.” When a group of soldiers, employees, followers, or even children understand that their authority figure is sincere in his or her promises and threats, then respect is established between those who lead and those who are lead. There is no arena of life where the principles of Tzu’s treatise cannot be applied and therefore I believe it is a book everyone should pick up and read through at least once in their life. "

I wonder if historically towering military leaders would agree with all of Sun Tsu's tactics. I look forward to reading Julius Caesar's account of his campaign in Gaul to compare stratagems. One of the reasons this is still widely read is because many of the techniques described here can be applied to psychological warfare, business strategies and competitive settings in general. Sun Tsu principal lessons are: - All warfare is based on deception('when able to attack, we must seem unable', 'appear where you are not expected');- he will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight;- he will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces;- know thyself;- force your enemy to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots;- avoid what is strong and attack at what is weak;- always expect the enemy;- if soldiers are punished before they grow attached to you, they will not prove submissive;- seize something which your opponent holds dear;- what enables generals to achieve more than ordinary men is foreknowledge;- knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men, not from intuition;It makes you wonder if human nature will ever allow for John Lennon's version of the world described in Imagine to exist."

Yes I feel it is an important book and I am glad that I read it. As to whether I think it is still relevant, maybe.

There's also an introduction which gives a brief history of the era Sun Tzu lived in and how his book came to be. It's interesting and worth a skimming.As for the actual book, it's alright. There are some interesting premises, but nothing ground-breaking, in my opinion. I think this is one of those books you like to say you've read to look cool.

By the end of the semester I had a good page long list of to-reads, due to the book references he always managed to sidle into his lectures. Amongst this inventory was a book entitled ""The Art of War"". This one continually got brought up throughout his tangents, and I found myself really wondering what it was all about (not disregarding the title) and who would write such a thing. But my humanly curiosity got the best of me and I soon found myself sifting through it's pages. I was surprised at how quick and easy of a read this was. I'm not quite sure what I really WAS expecting, but this did turn out to be different than what I must have subconsciously imagined. The almost ""bulleted"" outline made the chapters fly by quickly and before I knew it, it was over.I'm truthfully glad I took the time to read it, and found some truly ingenious schemes and thorough forethoughts that sculpted the mind of a wise and perceptive sage. I remember my poli sci professor remarking that the undertaking of this treatise was for the benefit of a king during Sun Tzu's time. What I do not know is if the king was hungry for power or simply smart and cultivated in his leadership, defense, and wartime appeal. But regardless, Tzu writes to someone that should be smart, compassionate, quick, cultivated, but yet aggressive in their wartime actions. But even with his shrewd knowledge, I often felt like Tzu was contradicting himself and talking himself in circles (taking into account the philosophical era it was written in). Regardless, he makes a bold point, and although times have changed; it is knowledge we even day can learn from."

""Do not camp on entrapped terrain, do not pursue feigned retreats"". Well, duh. I also question the wisdom of viewing your army as children. With all the lists present in this book concerning terrain, types of armies, generals and spies, I wouldn't be surprised that if Sun Tzu were alive today, he'd be a Buzzfeed contributor (no offense).

About half of the book is common sense strategies in war, while the other half contains understanding I didn’t see prior to reading this book. The author had good insight on each passage and included additional understanding of certain passages with other commentators of the book.I think I had a bad translation or reading it on the iTouch was a poor choice because the author commented on each passage WAY too much. Mid-sentence the author would write a mini paragraph on either an example of a certain strategy being carried out in war or more meaning to the phrase. It’s good to read the phrase first, and then read the commentary because stopping mid-sentence occasionally causes me to forget what was being said by Sun Tzu before the commentary.I heard they made an art of war for business, which I can see because businesses are trying to compete with other businesses"

The majority of Sun Tzu's teachings are lost in today's world of technology, a world where a nuclear warhead can be delivered from one superpower to the other within 30 minutes. I liked it, but the only use this book can have nowadays is for wishful readers to try and interpret the messages and apply them to their everyday lives, which I found quite difficult to do.Most memorable quote: ""If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, the general is to blame.

Plus there'll be bonus cred if you quote Sun Tzu, just b.coz the book has such a rep. But many work only as metaphors, because the era of warfare they describe is so far removed from our own - i mean i can see why the book is so popular, it combines the mystique of warfare and ""ancient Chinese writings"" with advice that is very open to interpretation, and so open to being used as a ""strategy guide"" for anyone from frustrated CEOs to aspiring politicos.Because of what i'd been told, i was expecting more a coherent argument or science of warfare, similar to what i found in Clausewitz. This is not that.i also found it interesting that much of the advice, to the degree that it might apply to non-state armed movements, tends to what i consider the fascist rather than the communist pole. I.e. the idea of inscrutability, of purposefully ""untransparent"" strategies. While this is good for us on a tactical level, on the level of strategy it flies in the face of any empowering strategy, which should ideally be comprehensible by ordinary people, which means unfortunately by our opponents."

Bella anche la premessa di Wu Ming (anche se un po' provocatoria, ma è nel loro stile) che aiuta a cogliere l'importanza e il significato de ""L'arte della guerra"".Anche quando sembra fare affermazioni ovvie, quest'opera appare moderna se si pensa è del v secolo a.C. circa. Oltre ai vari consigli strategici sull'esercito e i preparativi per una battaglia, Sunzi non incita alla guerra, anzi, elogia chi riesce ad ottenere vittorie sul nemico senza ingaggiare uno scontro, e consiglia di trattare con onore e rispetto il nemico sconfitto.Tra tutti i principi esposti, nel testo la frase che m'ha colpito di più è stata ""La guerra è fondata sull'inganno"", frase che per me risuona quanto mai attuale.

"1567",1566,"Philip Clark","It's a great book, but a terrible audio book. A great amount of the audio is introduction and commentary. I didn't need to know all that. I just wanted to read the meat of it. Definitely a book to actually read, not listen to."
"1571",1570,"Raisa","The Art of War is a military treatise said to have been written by the Chinese strategist Sun Tzu. In 1972, pieces of bamboo inscribed with text that was almost identical to the modern edition of this work were found. They dated back to 2nd century BC, and some less complete copies have been found which are probably even older.There is little historical mention of Sun Tzu, but many scholars believe him to be the military general known as Sun Wu (who lived around 5th or 6th century BC). This book is a little outside my comfort zone; I tend to stick to fiction. Anyway, I picked it up on a whim. It's a fairly short book divided into around 13 chapters, each one describing an aspect of warfare. I read an amusing review which started off saying that this book pointed out the painfully obvious. If your force is superior in numbers, advance, otherwise retreat- something you didn't need a high ranking military tactician to point out.But you have to remember that this text dates back to ancient times, and has endured through the years with people quoting from it extensively. There has to be something in here of worth, right?First of all, I got a bad translation of the book, which didn't help matters- but I still found it an interesting read. As the earlier reviewer noted, some of the things were fairly obvious. There's discussion of where to camp, and how to use the ground to your advantage. How to be a good leader and keep the morale of your troops up, and how best to defend your position. All things which might seem self evident, but sometimes you do need obvious truths condensed into guidelines.  Interestingly, Sun Tzu advocated the use of deception to try and avoid warfare, if possible. This might seem oxymoronic coming from a military general but it also makes sense- as Sun Tzu notes, war is expensive and takes many lives- so fighting should be avoided if possible. ""All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near."" rough quote. This section apparently is often quoted from in boardrooms and the book is now being seen as a guide to the corporate world, which is kind of depressing if you ask me. (Is the corporate world really that cutthroat? Who am I kidding, of course it is.)Anyway, the bits I enjoyed the most were the scholarly examples of battles where generals had successfully employed the tactics which Sun Tzu had written about. There was the little town who opened the city gates wide to show a few harmless people sweeping the road, causing the huge invading force outside to flee in terror, convinced of an ambush. There was no ambush, it was all a bluff. Brilliant! Or how about the general who split up his army and told them to flee only to at the last minute bring them together in a genius strategic move that routed the enemy? These sections illustrate how good leadership, even with a weaker force, can lead to victories. Another reason why it's so extensively quoted in business practise. Even though my translation wasn't perfect, it was good enough that I got the gist of the text and also an overview of the many different scholarly interpretations of it. Give it a try if you're into history, war fare or you feel like you're getting pushed around at work. (Although if you can relate to this from a business perspective, you might end up a) feeling a bit depressed b) riding into your next meeting on a horse, much to the bemusement of co-workers. I hope it's the latter.)"

"1585",1584,"Maaz Sheik","“The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.” If you're going to have a war soon, perhaps on your neighbor or aunt, this is the book you need to read to prepare yourself. Jokes apart, this book describes the basic fundamental rules and guidelines to war and tactics. Whether you need to fight or not, Sun Tzu clearly depicts each scenario for easy understanding. Even though it was written a couple thousand years ago, it's as useful and true today as it was then. That's what makes it a classic. When you read this one, you can imagine what each army possibly goes through for a battle with an enemy.And most importantly, this book shows the need of common sense and logic, strategys and overcoming challenges. A book with great wisdom and life-altering skills to be used throughout your life and not just in war. It's an easy book to read and understand, especially when you're going to war with your neighbor like me. Cheers. ""The wise warrior avoids the battle."""
"1587",1586,"Rhys Thomas","This is the ultimate guide for fighting a war. Used by army generals and now business leaders it contains all you need to know about fighting and winning. I would not normally read stuff like this but, like the book says, it’s good to know the enemy. The edition I have contains some interesting history lessons about the ancient Chinese and is undoubtedly fascinating. It’s a slim volume and can easily be read in a couple of hours. It also shows you how completely retarded war is. For example, there is a type of spy called a Doomed Spy. This is one that enters enemy territory with the intention of being caught so as to feed the enemy false information when interrogated. And then he gets killed. "

However, realizing I cannot possibly read all the books I want to read in my free time I decided to listen to those I was vaguely interested in. I'm glad this was an audio book or else I would have put it down and never read it again. Basically its interesting for one fact - it being ancient. (But to a modern ear, it was almost captain obvious in many parts of the book.) It is most famous for the idea that if one can avoid fighting - that is the best way. However if one cannot he lists out clever and quite philosophical strategies on beating the enemy. While these are to be seen as serious, to me the writing was quite romanticized, which I find as a bonus not a flaw. I guess it's worth a read, or a listen. It CAN in its underlying meaning teach you something about humanity outside of war, just in general competition we face daily. However like I said, to me it was a bit of restating the same point or pointing out the obvious. (Maybe because the text was ripped off so many times.) "

It is beneficial for one to know how to deal with conflict and the most effective way to handle it. In The Art of War, Sun Tzu list the different ways one can approach an army and win a war. Every move is strategically executed for an inevitable victory. This is one of the most intelligent works in war strategy that can be read in a matter of hours. Sun Tzu lays out the tactics and strategies used and necessary for victory during wartime. The beauty of this book is that all of the tactics and strategies listed can be used in any situation where conflict arises; not only in war. This book is all about understanding how war operates and the importance of knowledge over force. It is easier for someone to win a battle by thinking their way to victory than to use only strength and lose.

It gives advice on how to fight under different scenarios, terrains, etc. Something I found interesting is that there are only two strategies in war: the direct attack and the indirect attack and a combination of these two strategies produce many strategies that are useful under different circumstances. It says that war is all about deception, that if you are going to attack, you need to look like you are not going to attack, that if you are far away, you need to seem like if you are near, and vice versa, that if you are strong you need to look like if you are weak. Something else interesting was that the general needs to be very observant, because he will be able to tell if the other army is thirsty, hungry, tired, ready to fight till death, rebellious against their superiors, setting up an ambush, etc., just by keeping his eyes open."

"1676",1675,"Nino Pagliccia","I have just finished reading the classic book ""The art of war"" by Sun Tzu. The title is puzzling. ""Art and ""war"" in the same sentence sounds to me like ""fighting for peace"". Incongruous! Enough to make me curious. Yet the book is interesting. Apparently it is used as one of the texts in the US military academy.In fact, several of Sun's suggestions to the army General remind me of what we know of US military interventions in the world. Take this for instance: ""O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy’s fate in our hands."" The US government (NSA?) uses that tactic also on its own citizens. Or this: ""Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot."" And the gem for me is this one: ""All warfare is based on deception."" Naive Sun Tzu meant deception for the enemy, but the US military (and government) use ""enhanced"" deception of friends and citizens as well as enemies.Coincidentally I am also reading Tim Anderson's ""The Dirty War on Syria: Washington, Regime Change and Resistance"" (non yet on Goodreads; I have a PDF version). On the first few pages I found Anderson's reference to Sun's book in relation to the US ""dirty, covert wars, fought through proxies"" in the world. ""The US Army 'unconventional warfare' (UW) was revised several times to take account of the range of activities the US needed to pursue its ambitious plans. The 2008 version of this manual quotes with approval the ancient Chinese scholar of war, Sun Tsu: 'defeating the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill' (US Army 2008: 1.1)."" Just send others.Yes, the US has learned a lot in matters of warfare. It is time for us to learn about the Art of Peace."

"1682",1681,"Catherine Fitzsimmons","(Note: I'm not sure how to find the proper edition on GoodReads, but the version I read was the one available from Project Gutenberg and which came free on my ereader.)The title is perhaps slightly misleading; a far greater portion of the text of this ebook is devoted to analysis of The Art of War, rather than just the classic text itself. With so many comments from the translator - apparently the first good English translator - and various Chinese commentators who have analysed the text over the years, the actual text of The Art of War doesn't start until over a quarter of the way through the ebook, and comments are then interspersed throughout at least every two sentences of Sun Tzu's text. On the whole, I found the commentaries fairly unnecessary. Most of them are either interpretations of the original text, which I personally found didn't need clarification, or examples of how the strategies presented had been used effectively through numerous historical anecdotes, which, while interesting, on the whole didn't really add to the understanding of the text.As to The Art of War itself, I must admit I was surprised by its length and vagueness. The strategies and information covered were very general, delving more into matters such as terrain and reading the signs of enemy movement than in actually conducting pitched battle. Overall, much of Sun Tzu's content was plain common sense, and there was little information offered that I didn't already know from my scant study of military history. It was interesting, but considering the much-lauded status of this classic document, I have to admit I found the information a bit less useful than I anticipated. Still, it was inspiring and an enjoyable enough read."

"1688",1687,"Joyce","If anything, Sun Tzu makes a lot of sense in this ancient Chinese military treatise of his. Short and very concise, Sun Tzu's bottom line in his 'Art of War' is: avoid conflict if possible, but if you're are going to fight, then you fight to win. While I don't advocate the use of brutal/violent strategies mentioned, I think many of his points have a relevancy if you take the element of war out of the context and replace it with problems pertaining to everyday life.For example: VI. Weak Points and Strong: ""If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak. ""In a modern everyday context I relate this to trying to dabble in everything but at the end of it all, you are no closer to achieving anything even when your resources are all depleted because there has been a lack of focus and singular drive needed to properly accomplish even one goal.Touch wood that you're not interested in reading this because you're preparing for war. I do think though, that this is a valuable read if you are prepared to try and see the underlying principles in ""The Art of War"" that are applicable beyond the grounds of battle to aspects as such personality, mentality, and the way you approach goals and achievements."
"1689",1688,"Matthew Johnson","For the oldest military text in the world it's pretty readable. Written in around 500BC by a total badass called Sun Tzu, it also has a bunch of subsequent anecdotes in which famous Chinese generals have used his strategies to bring the pain, mostly during the same warring states period of the zhou dynasty. It gave me my first really understanding of the nuts and bolts of history, and it allowed me to better understand the Warfare in game of thrones. But it's still military tactics and so reading it was a bit effortful. “All warfare is based on deception.” "

"1722",1721,"Diana","The Kindle version was kind of confusing because of the editor/translator person's comments, but the stuff that was actually from Art of War was pretty cool. Sometimes it seemed obvious, because today we're pretty advanced militarily, but Sun Tzu's teachings were almost revolutionary back then, and we still use those basic ideas today. I liked thinking about how these principles could apply to my life--for example, don't wait for the enemy to attack to be prepared is like making sure I'm ready for an emergency before it happens."
"1724",1723,"Nanosynergy","The Art of War has been on my ‘to read’ list for a long time because it seems to be frequently referenced and I wanted to read the source of the hype. Sun Tzu’s lists of adages are grouped by topic into 13 chapters (see helpful overview at Wiki Art of War.The chapter titles are: 1) Laying Plans (Detail Assessment & Planning, Calculations); 2) Waging War (The Challenge); 3)Attack by Stratagem (Strategic Attack, The Plan of Attack); 4) Tactical Dispositions (Disposition of the Army, Positioning); 5) Energy (Forces, Directing); 6) Weak Points & Strong (Weaknesses & Strengths, Illusion & Reality); 7) Maneuvering (Military Maneuvers, Engaging the Force); 8) Variation in Tactics (Variations & Adaptability, The Nine Variations); 9) The Army on the March (Movement & Development of Troops, Moving the Force); 10) Terrain (Situational Positioning); 11) The Nine Situations (The Nine Battlegrounds); 12) The Attack by Fire (Attacking with Fire, The Fiery Attack); 13) The Use of Spies (Intelligence and Espionage, The Use of Intelligence).This is more a book to be studied and discussed, rather than read. I’ve never read a military strategy book and have no background to really judge this book’s value in the field, except to note that it appears to be an important text still used today in military training academies. For me, the book has the same feel of a business advice or self-help book, summarizing common sense observations/advice. It is not a page turner. Sections are repetitive and other sections I apparently don’t have the background to understand and will have to consult some secondary sources – should I want to pursue this further. Once I got used to the style of writing, I did find sections very interesting and relevant and am glad I took the time to slog through it.My first read of this book was a 4-CD version I found on sale. I listened to it while driving my kids to/from lessons. They found it boring. The reader, Joe Mantegna, does a good job. However, as I discovered, this is not the best book to first experience in audio format. It is better suited to an initial visual read. I ended up also reading it online at Sonshi.com and at Gutenberg Art of War and then re-listening."
"1726",1725,"Aarón","I find it hard to believe that this how-to on ancient warcraft can be applied by, as the back cover suggests, ""modern corporate warriors looking for an advantage in the boardroom."" Most of this book is very much of and for its time, and strictly applies to war--tactics, ethics, subterfuge etc. Unless you think that engaging the enemy in the sun with hills to your back is a synergistic paradigm going forward.I've read quotations of Sun Wu that were much more florid and oriental than those in this particular translation. Try a different edition."
"1729",1728,"EJ Johnson","Written between 505 and 496 BC by a famous Chinese General. The manuscript translated by Lionel Giles has commentaries and explanations. In the audio book, the original is read by one actor and the commentary by another. Surprisingly very interesting."

I had the Gutenberg Kobo version translated by Lionel Giles and first published 1910.Actually pretty interesting, but easily summed up as ""don't fight unless you know for sure you can win.""Given that the original is 2500 years old, there's obviously been some loss in terms of translation and original meaning, as well as uncertainty as to who wrote what and when, but the content is very interesting to think about and quite enlightening when viewed in terms of the way ""great"" military leaders became successful.It's a short, easy read, so why not?"

"1738",1737,"Lisa Feld","This seems like a good translation, and I like Cleary's choice to interweave Sun Tzu's ideas with those of classic commentators on his work; it felt very Talmudic. But I went into this expecting that it would read similarly to Machiavelli: advice to leaders that is so specific that it offers insight into the author's culture and possible plot ideas for a writer like me. While some of the later chapters do get into specifics of strategy and battle, the bulk of the book was vague platitudes about power that occasionally contradicted each other. The translator also bulked up this slim work with a long, repetitive introduction: it was good to learn a little about Sun Tzu's background in the Warring States period, the personalities of the commentators, and Cleary's theory that Sun Tzu's work is an attempt to bring people to peaceful Taoism by minimizing the necessity for war, but the intro didn't have nearly enough substance to deserve being 40 pages of a 170-page book."

This book offered more than just tactics to win a war, it offered things that we could do or should do everyday to either better ourselves or simple sayings that we get from the book. I don’t believe now that all of what is written in the book could be used in battle today has so many years have gone by since this book had been written. If people didn’t take the literal war meanings of the book this book would be great for everyday life as some can hold to getting through life or maneuvering around a tough situation.If I had to read this book again I would definately not do it in my spare time as I find thought provoking and books that make me question things after I read them more interesting, but I would recommend this book to anyone going through any difficult times as you can pick out sayings and advice throughout the book."

It was like a history lesson, about the great leaders of china at the time of Sun Tzu. It was a rough book to read because the introduction was longer than the chapters. I also found it confusing because of all of the different names the characters had. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the routes of war techniques many powerful leaders learned and used."
"1759",1758,"Flora","Seems more like a helpful reminder/reinforcement than a groundbreaking collection on battle tactics, though the 90-page-long intro spent an awful lot of time on finding just the right historical context for this piece.Looked at it largely as an office management treatise."

"1782",1781,"Achilee","I read the translation from Lionel Gilles, interspersed with readings of the interpretation of Father Amiot (a French Jesuit who lived in China in the 18th century and was a high officer of the Chinese State). Gilles' version was all right but not enjoyable for me. Flat, boring. His style does not match my taste... I far preferred the clarity and the elegant writing of Amiot. 2 different men, 2 different cultures, 2 different times. Note that there is anything to infer from what I just said: it reflects more my taste than a true judgement on the quality of the text itself. A text which by nature does not ""engage"" me. To be fair, reading a war treatise and witnessing in the modern world that indeed all warfare is still based on deception does not inspire me. Yet I appreciate when Sun Tsu intersects with Lao Tsu both concurring in that the greatest victory is that which requires no battle. But remember that The Way also advises us that victory should not be praised. I must be more Tao than Art-of-War. Or maybe I am tired of witnessing wars altogether, there be business wars which I am all too familiar with or military ones..."

"1843",1842,"Amar Khan","The book itself is terrible only due to a the translation (try using a different version) but the underlying information was still good enough to merit 3 stars out of the 4 it otherwise should have gotten - note that nothing is perfect yet and as such I never give 5/5."
"1845",1844,"Darius Cuffy","I remember reading this with a few friends in my old school. I found it so interesting. I only remember parts of the book. So I will be reading this again for sure. "
"1846",1845,"Shu Lindsey","""故將有五危：必死可殺，必生可虜，忿速可侮，廉潔可辱，愛民可煩；(There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.)""""故明君慎之，良將警之, (Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution.)"""
"1849",1848,"Courtney Conant","Great info but it just kind of ended..."
"1850",1849,"Jeff Sugden","To me this was one of those books that I had always wanted to read because it was referenced so often in movies and TV. The book was very interesting, but not what I thought it would be. The first part is a history of the book from the time it was first written, to how it was compiled, and ultimately how it came into the western world. Sun Tzu and his fellow generals give broad and specific examples of how to wage and win a war. The interesting thing is up until satellite imagery became a new tool in warfare, all of his advice was still pretty good, but with advances in technology much of his philosophy is no longer relevant. Perhaps the most poignant statement he made was ""a protracted war is not good for the country"". Amen. I'd recommend the book if you're curious what all the fuss is about, but while interesting it's not something you feel you need to get to the end of quickly."
"1852",1851,"Kayla","“Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.”“The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”“All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.”“Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win”“There is no instance of a nation benefiting from prolonged warfare.”“Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons. And they will follow you into the deepest valley.”“One may know how to conquer without being able to do it. ”"
"1856",1855,"Yulya Roesdy","The Art of War by Sun Tzu is a well known book that is easy to digest. This book is recommended for anyone who is interested in politics, business or philosophy. It will give you an insight about the importance of knowing your enemy and knowing yourself. -Yulya Roesdy-"
"1858",1857,"Kristen Anglesey","The Art of War, written by Sun Tzu, is a guide to know how to be a leader. Whether a person wants to lead an army or lead a small business, this book will teach him/her how to lead and how to do it well. Not only is it helpful, it is also inspiring. If a reader is looking for some good insight, The Art of War is a good book to read."
"1859",1858,"Elspeth","Very interesting, very mind opening though at times I felt the translater insulted my intelligence a time or two."
"1865",1864,"Amy Wilder","Oh yeah so basically, if you can win, you MUST fight. If you can't win, you must NOT fight. Basically we like to do the opposite."
"1866",1865,"Michael Murdoch","Invariably useful should you tend to pick your battles. Or if you are constantly involved within impromptu bar fights."
"1868",1867,"Stephen Chung","was actually disappointed"
"1875",1874,"Jenn Johnson","This was a satisfactory book but I personally feel that the majority of critiques stating that this work the best in strategy is overrated."
"1877",1876,"Mr. Kovach","A famous book by Sun Tzu (born in 544 AD) about the art of war. Interesting if inevitably a little dry."
"1882",1881,"Jay Kovach","Not what I thought it would be. I really thought there would be some deeply reflective concepts, but maybe this has infiltrated pop culture more than I realized. A lot of it came across as common sense. It's referenced so much though that I am glad to have read it at least once."
"1884",1883,"Jon Wexford","Classic."
"1885",1884,"Jan Lodl","Zajímavá kniha, rozhodně to není špatná příručka pro manažery. Spousta rad o vedení války je aplikovatelná i na jiné oblasti života."
"1886",1885,"ERNEST MORE","I read Sun Tzu's 13-chapter Art of War book back in 1999. Now I am listening to it again on audiobook translated and with an introduction by Samuel B. Griffith read by Alexander Adams.This book is very comprehensive. It includes in addition to Sun Tzu's 13-chapter, historical timelines with associated stories, the background and history of the book itself including dating methods, and related names that proceed and follow Sun Tzu, along with commentary from names such as Lao Tzu and Mao Zedong."
"1887",1886,"Suza","Bush should have read this prior to engaging us in these long distances, long lasting wars"
"1888",1887,"Amit Shetty","Read for some very interesting quotes."
"1890",1889,"Dev","The wise warrior avoids the battle. But if you must fight, Chinese general Sun Tzu outlines military knowledge in The Art of War to this day remains one of the most referenced books written on military strategy. The knowledge gained in the Art of War can be applied by the diverse mind to many different areas of life."
"1892",1891,"Mikaelyn","Why don't more heads of state read this?"
"1894",1893,"JoAnn","First ebook!! Well, second, but the first one was on the Amazon kindle app... Anyhoo, well-written and straightforward, despite how long it took me to finish it :/."
"1896",1895,"Sam Grace","Enjoyed the audiobook with the two voices speaking the original text and notes."
"1900",1899,"Kristine","This fit nicely in the class I read it for, which dealt with war literature. I can see where it has found use throughout the ages, but it made for rather dry reading. It's definitely worth looking at from both the historical standpoint and how it continues to influence modern warfare, even though much of it may seem like common sense now."
"1902",1901,"Sargon","This is more of a pick it up when you’re bored and just look through the quotes type book. I like one part that talks about being like water, flowing with the slope and moving around rocks, boulders, and other road blocks when they present themselves."
"1903",1902,"Kristina","The Art of War by SunTzu is not only a book on war tactics, but also a book on how to be a great leader. Many business men and women use this book when they are trying to run a business or be a great leader in the business world. Throughout the book there is use of symbolism and characters seen such as the dragon (Yang) and the phoenix ( Yin). The Yang represents masculinity and positive nature, but Yin is the complete opposite representing negativity and is seen as feminine. Both help to balance each other out and throughout the book the reader sees that neither should outweigh the other. There needs to be a great balance to be a great leader. During the book the reader will see the importance of strategy and tactic on how to fight the enemy, without coming near them or not to be put in a position where the army would surrounded them. The Art of War shows also how to observe the terrain by looking at if the army should adapt to the grounds or give ideas on what circumstances would be faced in battle because of the terrain. The book even discusses how spies should be treated and how the use of spies can benefit the war. This book is seen mostly as a war book, but many of the knowledge of the war tactics and roles can be used in everyday life. It is a great influential work and can help others to gain insight on how to move up in a business or to be better aware when surrounded by one’s own enemies. I would recommend this book as more of a self-help book in the since of wanting to gain some type of leadership or as someone getting ready to go fight in a war.- Kristina Simpson"
"1904",1903,"Jorge Suarez","Interesantes las estrategias que aplicaba, y muy ciertas."
"1907",1906,"Vivek Jain","the ideas are good. But it is more of a academic project."
"1913",1912,"Quentin","Not really applicable to my own life in any ways. I do suggest ""48 Laws of Power"" by Robert Greene though, to substitute for this."
"1915",1914,"Lefty Leenie","Funny how common sense never changes"
"1916",1915,"Man Solo","Needs better translation....."
"1920",1919,"Tony Derricott","Recommended by Susan Aylworth (wife of MormonTimes.com columnist Roger H. Aylworth)A list of war tactics.Good for a coach to have on his reference shelf."
"1923",1922,"Nura.m","Since this is the oldest military treatise in the world, I was expecting a boring journey while reading it. Surprisingly however, it was a very interesting one. I never thought I would be enjoying a military book, but I did!Although a lot of people say that Sun Tzu provided nothing but common sense, he has to be given the credit of being the first one to document that ""common sense"".One thing I really liked is the translator's obvious effort. I liked how he tried his best to explain the Chinese words that do not have an equivalent in English and put that as a note between brackets. On the other hand, I hated the organization of the structure. Anyhow, this book gave me a wider view and a better understanding of politics. The war methods in it can be applied to the cold wars we go through everyday, Lol. "
"1925",1924,"Lalit Kishore","A very drab translation. The author fails to understand that the success of a book like this depends not just on the content which is in most cases pedestrian knowledge but also on the form, and the book is severely deficient in the latter. The only memorable parts of the book were the near verbatim reproduction of various commentaries about the book by different Chinese philosophers which should give an idea of how good(or bad) this particular version is. The only redeeming aspect of this book is the low cost (a couple of dollars)."
"1927",1926,"Hajer Elmahdi ","While i was trying to sleep, i stumbled upon audio of the art of war, with my apocalyptic thinking, i always assumed i'd need to read about how to wage and win a war just in case, but Sun Tzu's book was more of a guideline to how to win a war, if you ever find yourself in one ( bummer i know ). it's composed of 13 chapters, military tactics, deception, battle fields, when to attack, when to take defense, spies, etc. Lots of what was being said is your common sense and can easily be applied in your everyday arguments. it's as simple as if there's a 'versus' scenario, use these strategies. It's a short straight to the point easy read book with lots of catchy quotes. "
"1928",1927,"Nicholas Parsons","A great read, as the style tells as much about the author and the time in which he was writing as it does about the art of war. Many of the principles are simply declared to be true, rather than argued or reasoned, and the source of the data relied upon in what little argument there is is never disclosed. Despite these criticisms, the book contains much wise advice still applicable today and makes for an interesting read."
"1930",1929,"Xavier Ashe","The Art of War is so ingrained into popular culture, both directly and applied as a derivative to non-war topics like business, that by the time I actually read this cover to cover, I knew most of the content. I know that the book was not intended to be broken down into simple, abstract philosophies on conflict, but that's how most people read it. I gained no new insights, but recognize it's influence. 3 stars."
