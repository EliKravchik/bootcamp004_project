0,Leae,this was a creepy book for me because I see so much of it happening now that I have to make myself stop being anti-government and despondent. Just one big idea is the compressing of language until it is impossible to talk about anything thought provoking and then I see everybody texting and I realize that a group of letters strewn together is actually code for a whole sentence and I think Oh No! It's already happening!
1,Soad,"This book will always be a classic, no matter what generation reads it. Things in 1984 have not changed much and don't plan on changing any time soon. But the ending was difficult to understand, why does he love big brother? Why do we love oppression,domination is it in our nature??? There is this Iraqi saying البزون يحب خناغا I wonder if it applies here :))"

4,Leanna Wheatley,"Winston Smith wrestles with oppression in Oceania, a place where the Party examines human actions with ever-watchful Big Brother.Winston dares to express his thoughts in a diary and pursues a relationship with a woman.It's terrifying to think of a world in which your own children are spies for the government and can turn you in, where cameras are watching you 24/7.My mind did wander quite a bit while I was reading this book, thinking of the eerie possibilities, trying to find parallels between what I was reading and what I was observing in society. LOVED this book. I would recommend to any and everyone. So many interesting concepts. "

6,Yolanda Sfetsos,"This is a classic that I've been meaning to read for ages, so when I saw it on the Google Play Store, I grabbed it for my Galaxy Note. The year is 1984, the world is at war and Big Brother not only controls everything and everyone, but he can also see what everyone is doing. Every home and place of work has a telescreen which spits out propaganda, news, and can watch your every move.In this world, there is no privacy. There's no individual thought. There's only fear and hate. Children are horrid little spies, marriages are organised, and betrayal happens all the time. It's a barren society with no colour.It's also where Winston Smith's story takes place. He's in the Outer Party and works at the Ministry of Truth. He plays by the rules just like everyone else, but when he starts secretly writing in a journal his whole life changes. Now he's starting to think about things, he's starting to question why the past needs to be altered, and can actually remember instances of changes being made that he knows are false. He's also noticed Julia. When the two start seeing each other in secret, they both know they're breaking the rules and will eventually get caught. But neither one of them cares because Winston is falling in love with her, and has become obsessed with the rebellion... I kept hoping that Winston and Julia would just runaway and escape the Party, but of course they don't do that. This book is an amazing read! It's well written, hooked me in right away, has some pretty elaborate worldbuilding, and a narrator that you can really feel for. I have to admit that at one point the info got a bit much, but I soon forgot about that because of the devastating situation that followed. :(It's a sad story about a man who wants the world to be different but has to pretend he's compliant like everyone else. It's also a story about forbidden love and the strength of the human spirit. It's also about endurance and being pushed so far that breaking point becomes the only solution.It's one of the best books I've ever read, yet at the same time it saddened and angered me. It's depressing, and the ending tore me up inside because it's just so hopeless. But I have to admit that it's fitting, and certainly didn't go the way I expected.Yeah, I loved it. This is one of those books that leaves a lasting impression on you."

10,Casey,"1984 is a terrifyingly accurate portrayal of what could happen if our world becomes more obsessed with both power and the ability to eradicate crime. While I'm all for eradicating crime, once we step into the realm of limiting privacy for the sake of 'safety', I begin to worry. Our individuality is as sacred as our lives. We cannot give up one to strengthen the other because there really is no point to doing that.Orwell creates a masterful world full of characters we can all, disturbingly, relate to. Winston's most degrading act, at least in his eyes, of (view spoiler)[betraying Julia by begging for her to suffer via the rats in his place is relatable even as it is atrocious, because Orwell portrays that scene so vividly that you cannot doubt that Winston had no ability to hold to his morals, which is terrifying. Usually, dystopias allow us to see through the eyes of one who beats the system, and it is depressing to realize that, given those sorts of situations, we would likely be among those who blindly follow the system, or are at the very least defeated in the end even if we did try to fight. 1984 has a protagonist who loses in the end. He completely loses everything he is, not just the fight he was trying to wage against an unfair world. Winston Smith is, in the end, nothing more than a shell of a man who has no inclination to fight the system because he has been warped to the point that he agrees with the system that warped him using horrifying means. (hide spoiler)]This book is applicable to all ages in time because as long as there are people, there will be those who desperately desire power and will do anything to attain it, and there will also be those who will seek power with the intent to only use it for good. Unfortunately, both types of people tend to make bad decisions, though one is aware of how horrible their decisions are and the other believes they are doing what they are doing for the greater good, and that they will stop their atrocities as soon as the world is fair, which it won't be, because they are helping to make it cruel and unfair."

12,James Pitt,"Holy cow. What can I say? This book was amazing! I don’t want to interpret it because hundreds of others have done so already, so I will discuss why I liked it and why you will too.The prose is perfectly formed, not a word out of place. Orwell was a perfectionist of the highest order. I wonder how many drafts he went through while writing this novel? Despite the perfection, the prose is rather formulaic. It is the themes and story that were revolutionary; most contemporary dystopian novels ride off this book’s back.The book started off rather slow and, because the prose was so formulaic, it took me awhile to read. However, after the first few chapters it picks up and once it does you cannot put it down; without spoiling anything, the latter half of the novel is particularly engaging.I think the thing I like best about this novel is the attention to detail. I have already mentioned that Orwell was a perfectionist, and it shows. Just read the appendix on Newspeak, the official language of Oceania (futuristic Britain). How many other writers would create an entire language just for a single book? If it was a fantasy series, maybe, but a standalone novel?Orwell manages to paint a depressing and believable alternate world of constant war and fear. I definitely recommend it, no matter how old you are.(Also, Kim il-sung, founder of North Korea, clearly read this book when it came out; it has North Korea written all over it!)"

14,Jack Harding,"Orwell's 1984 is a brilliant (although very bleak) novel which depicts a totalitarian future. All activities and thoughts are being watched by the government (""Big Brother"") and the truth is constantly being manipulated to the point where the society no longer has a history. The plot revolves around Winston Smith, a man who works for the Ministry of Truth by doctoring various documents and photographs in order to fit the current narrative that the government is telling citizens. Smith begins to challenge the Big Brother by committing small acts of rebellion. It starts with keeping a journal, then leads to a love affair, which leads him to want to look for ways of getting involved in a revolution.First, let me say that Orwell's work is a product of its times in certain aspects - Britain had just been through two world wars which were only eighteen years apart. Orwell had also seen the rise of totalitarianism in Russia, Spain, Italy, and Germany. Yet Orwell, takes these aspects a step further into the future with the use of totalitarian sates, atomic weaponry, and the military industrial complex to create a very bleak new world. The writing and descriptions are wonderful. The book really makes you think, not only about society, but about history, happiness, love and the truth.Second, I read the 1984 Commemorative Edition, this was rather interesting as it contains a rather insightful essay by Erich Fromm at the end and an interesting foreword by Walter Cronkite at the beginning. Cronkite discusses the book in relation to his experience with news and the news of the day ( which is rather interesting considering the edition is about thirty years old).If you enjoy this I would strongly recommend Animal Farm by George Orwell, Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, and Amusing Ourselves To Death by Neil Postman. I would also recommend the show Futurama by the creators of the Simpsons, once you read 1984 you will see that the creators have taken many ideas from Orwell and Huxley."
15,Leah,"There are more sophisticated reviews about this book, but I just wanted to write that it has coloured my view of the world. It shows the great potential for humanity (even in the guise of the very normal Winston) as well as the great dangers of organised humanity (e.g. governments). Unfortunately a lot has happened since Orwell wrote this masterpiece, and a lot of it hasn't been very good. Either politicians read this book for ideas, or the wrong people aren't reading the warnings. Or something like that.I think everyone should read this book, or at least try to. It is a serious read and a little dry at times, but some reading needs persistence. Not everything should be easy to digest candy floss."

18,Ali Korkor,An eloquently written masterpiece about humanityIt's not whether Orwell thoroughly predicted the future or not but it's just that you can't help but be overwhelmed by a man with such a vision 
19,Cassie,"War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength. Big Brother is always watching. This book is mind blowing. Literally. Not only is it a classic in my opinion but it is a very relatable book, even though it is fictional. George Orwell wrote this in the belief that the world would someday be like a controlled dystopia someday, that the world was in a fight of control and that little hope existed to break free. If you enjoyed The Resistance soundtrack by the band Muse, then you will love this book. Muse's album was based off of this book, and if you listen carefully, you can hear the hints dropped like ""the thought police"" or ""will they find our hiding place?"". I was a little unsure about reading it at first, but honestly, after everything got so crazy and unpredictable, I was hooked. If you are ready to be shaken awake from your lazy day-dream type books, then this is the book to do it. I couldn't believe it played out like it did, and though some parts were interesting enough and all of it was insanely surreal, it was one of the most life altering books I have ever read. I most definitely recommend this book to everyone, whether you are a fan of fiction or not, this book is for the world, like it was meant to be. "
20,Kressel Housman,"The first time I attempted this book was in the real 1984, but I gave up on it pretty quickly. The prose style just didn’t grab me. So after all these years, I figured 1984 would be one of those classics I would never get around to. Of course, the book has had such a strong cultural impact, you don’t have to have read it to know about the concept of Big Brother. That very concept is what finally prompted me to read the book. In this Internet Age with NSA surveillance, is Big Brother watching? Or is it just a whole bunch of little brothers trying to sell us stuff? I’m more inclined to believe the latter, but I recognize the possibility of the former. In any case, it seemed high time I read the book.Just as happened decades ago, I found the prose style of the first hundred or so pages boring and difficult to get through, but now I understand that Orwell did that deliberately. Winston, the protagonist, is supposed to be isolated, so there’s very little dialogue to move the plot along. Things pick up with the introduction of Julia. From there on, it’s as suspenseful and riveting as any other novel. For me, the best part of the book was Goldstein’s section, even though it was pure narrative and had no dialogue at all. It was such a brilliant distillation of how totalitarian societies operate. The war section reminded me of an insight from Eric Hoffer's The True Believer: “Mass movements can rise and spread without belief in a G-d, but never without belief in a devil.” Hoffer and Orwell were contemporaries, and both were writing in the aftermath of World War II. I had a similar yearning for non-fiction in the torture section of the book; it made me want to read some real prison memoirs to find out what it’s really like. Fiction can give us a great window on reality, but I like to combine its lessons with reality itself.1984 definitely deserves its status as a classic. Everyone alive should read it at some point. But ultimately, I’m not as pessimistic as Orwell. The kinds of power plays he describes most definitely exist, but I believe that the spirit of Winston is stronger. And really, since 1984 is more cautionary tale than reality, in writing this novel, I guess Orwell believed in the Winston in all of us, too."
21,Natali,"Words cannot describe this book. I am utterly speechless. The pure fear and anticipation George Orwell transferred to his readers was so tangible, I was literally shaking in my seat and jumping at surprising parts of the novel. If it goes to say anything, I'm reading this book for a CLASS and I could not put it down. The story itself is unforgettable, with well developed characters and relationships and a perfect description of a dystopian world. And the worst part? IT ALL MAKES SENSE. The society's reasoning, the society's policies, everything made sense. Was it a government that ran on fear and punishment? Yes. Were the people brainwashed and ignorant to the world around them? Yes. But as I read through the story, this government has done what all wish to do: fully and completely control the population. Sure, it wasn't honorable, but in a society like that the word honorable does not exist. Every person should read this book, because it explains what would happen if we give the government too much power. I'm terribly sorry if this review sounds choppy and unorganized, but I really don't have enough words to describe how amazing and eye opening this book is. "
22,Jon Norimann,"A political classic and as scuh a must read. Although its heavily dated and the ideas in it are better summarized elsewhere, this is among the original sources for all literature and discussion on government control, spying and ideas about the future in general."

24,Monthly Book Group,"“1984” was written by George Orwell during 1947 and 1948 while he was living on the Scottish island of Jura, and suffering with tuberculosis. It was published in 1949, and met with immediate success. Orwell died in 1950. Our Group read it in conjunction with “We” by Yevgeny Zamyatin.The proposer of the book felt the political content set Orwell the novelist's imagination on fire, making it one of the greatest novels of the post-war period. Orwell is more of an iconoclast than an ideologue, and his driving passion is a hatred for all forms of authority. Orwell is brilliant at identifying and attacking the abuse of power, and 1984 is best seen as an extended denunciation of where this can lead, a kind of worst-case scenario. Orwell’s “Animal Farm” is another effective, development of this themeThe date of 1984 is not critical to Orwell’s intentions –the book is an extrapolation of some of the political and cultural directions of the 1930s and 1940s, including Nazism and, in particular, Soviet communism. The book is more political satire than science fiction, and the items of futuristic technology described (telescreens and hidden microphones for example) were primarily of interest as tools of state surveillance. The uses of CCTV and internet and mobile phone surveillance in contemporary societies suggest that Orwell was not too far off the mark in this respect. The shabby living conditions and food rationing further locate the book’s world as that of the 1940s, albeit an altered and extrapolated version of that world.Who are the proles of today? One felt that we were all as powerless as Orwell’s proles, and that contemporary political cliques held power as surely as The Party in the book. Others disagreed, pointing out that we had a vote for who was in government, and could influence government policies. Although Orwell closely follows the plot of the earlier “We” by Zamyatin (a debt which he acknowledged), he improves upon it in many ways, and develops two brilliant themes that were absent from the previously published book. These are the idea of re-writing history (which is actually the occupation of the book’s protagonist Winston Smith) and the idea of a gradual constriction and diminution of spoken and written language (Newspeak) in order to eliminate any form of conceptual thought inimical to the state.The book is as much socio/political essay as novel, and therefore inevitably raised questions of a general nature about humanity and systems of society. Are the “Sun” and the “Daily Mail” examples in practice of a kind of Newspeak? Can conceptual thought be limited by a paucity of vocabulary and grammatical sophistication? How do physicists for example develop concepts for which there was no existing vocabulary? Do different world languages govern their users’ modes of thought? The appendix on Newspeak, being written as a description of a failed idea, and not in Newspeak, provides a subtle note of optimism at the end of the book by suggesting that the world described in “1984” has come to an end. Orwell had a fundamentally pessimistic view of human nature, and the portrayal of the sadistic O’Brien is a chilling vision of how the ultimate use of power can be deliberately to cause suffering for others. In Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and many other places and times this tendency in human nature could be observed in practice in the real world. “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely”.We turned to the question of whether or not Orwell’s pessimism extended to disillusion with the British Labour Party in the post-war period. After all, the Party in 1984, “Ingsoc” in Newspeak, is “English Socialism”. Was Labour’s programme of nationalization and anti-capitalism merely resulting in the creation of a new political clique, and failing to benefit the proletariat? One who had read Orwell’s political essays of the time, had found no real evidence of disillusion of this kind. Rather Orwell hated all forms of authority, and his experiences of growing up in an English boarding school, and the low self-esteem evidenced by his poverty-stricken existence as an adult may have been more potent drivers of his vision than simple political preferences. In fact “Ingsoc” bears more similarities to Soviet socialism than British socialism. O’Brien’s invented enemy of the state, Goldstein, for example seems to be a clear equivalent of the disgraced Trotsky in Stalin’s Russian…..This is an extract from a review at http://www.monthlybookgroup.com/ Our reviews are also to be found at http://monthlybookgroup.blogspot.co.uk/"

26,Henry,"The book is so dark it almost becomes unbearable. No hope for humanity can be seen. Orwell speaks through the mind of the ultimate dictator. The book is written after the Soviet great terror, the Nazi holocaust and before the Chinese Communist cultural revolution, and superseded them all. 1984, Newspeak and doublethink will stay timely as long as there is authoritarian government on the planet. "
27,Radwa," The only thing you can afford to think while reading Nineteen Eighty-Four is that Orwell was exaggerating, or pessimistic. Because, imagine what a nightmare it would be to think that human civilization might, at any point in history, evolve in such a way as to produce such a dark, dystopian world. A world where you're being watched 24/7 so that if you produce any behavior - varying from a word uttered in your sleep to a facial expression - associated with ""thought crime"", you get tracked down, caught, tortured then wiped out from existence. A world where even the smallest pleasures of life are no longer possible to enjoy. What would it be like if history was constantly falsified and forged to suit the ruling party's present discourse; if two and two could make five, or four, or three - or whatever the hell the Party said they make - because the very existence of objective truth is denied: things are only what the Party thinks they are? This fictional world which Orwell created is scary in many aspects, but there is one thing in particular which it scared the daylight out of me to think could happen: the complete and perfect maturity of totalitarianism. The ""Party"" made all other totalitarian regimes that I've heard of look like amateurs. They will no longer settle for shutting you up, or having you say what they want you to say. No, they won't settle for anything short of you believing, thinking and feeling according to their plan. There is basically an entire organization out there whose main purpose is to suck the life out of you and fill you with lunatic enthusiasm and patriotism instead. An entire system is designed to minimize, and preferably diminish, your existence as an individual; you are no more than a unit of a bigger entity, so even your brain should function as merely a cell in that entity's brain. The scariest part of it all is not only that they constantly succeed, it's also that they are more honest with themselves than their predecessors. ""One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship,"" O'Brien tells Winston in the torture chamber. Torture chamber. Physical pain. One of the most terrifyingly heartbreaking themes in Nineteen Eighty-Four. How unabashedly and plainly Orwell speaks of it and describes it. Winston Smith, our protagonist, is not a hero who withstand pain for what he believes in, he is a normal guy whose soul gets crushed by its impact. Even a hint to the possibility of the existence of such a hero is never made. Pain is unbearable and it hurts you and crushes you and drains your soul, Orwell seems to say. Generally, Nineteen Eighty-Four is regarded as a ""prophecy"", but I personally prefer to see it as a warning against the moment when the extract of all the dictatorial experiences throughout history may be crystallized into an applicable theory, upon which is based an impenetrable regime. Therefore, the exaggeration, for me, is a magnification - for us to take an in-depth look at how things work in (totalitarian) governments. This is particularly why I think this book is a must-read; because we could rename it 'Your Guide to Knowing How Dictatorships Are Established and Sustained'; because it offers you a brilliant dissection of the ideology and the mechanisms of a mighty totalitarian regime.

28,Ana Carina,mind blowing
29,Nataly,Nunca un libro me había deprimido tanto en toda mi vida.
30,Phil Elmore,"Here comes a candle to light you to bed. Here comes a chopper to chop off your head. Here comes a novel to change, for the rest of your life, how you think of governmental power.I read ""1984"" IN 1984. At the time I had no idea just how powerful would become Orwell's writing in my life. I doubt you could argue that any other book has been more influential in American politics and government. The looming visage of Big Brother intimidates us all... and it should, because we all live with, walk under, and sleep in bed next to an all-powerful government whose reach is arguably greater (and considerably more insidious) than the technotalitarian dystopia of Eric Blair's book.People in modern society use terms from 1984 every day. Hell, there's an insipid 'reality' television show named ""Big Brother."" The language, the themes, and the warnings of this novel are so interwoven in popular culture that it would be impossible to eradicate them... yet far too few people, especially younger people, have *read* 1984 or understand the implications of the society it depicts.Orwell's horrible future is melodramatic, yes. Governments today boil their frogs considerably more slowly and with greater finesse, couching always their machinations as what is best for everyone. They understand, as Eric ""George Orwell"" Blair did, that ""everyone"" seldom includes the individual. When that individual is subordinated to the all-powerful state, we are collectively diminished even as we are individually damned. "
31,Edinson Arrieta aguas,"Gran re-lectura. Muy recomendada, especialmente para aquellos con arraigados preceptos humanistas."
32,Thomas,"Still significant, still relevant, and still a scary concept. There are parallels in today's government in the ""Big Brother"" approach -- the common are not wise enough to know what is good for them. So government knows what is good for them (freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength). I recommend it as a classic book that is thought provoking, engrossing, and intelligent. At the end, you as the reader need to draw you own conclusions of the main protagonist, and if what you had read is a warning, a prophecy, or just pure fiction."
33,Alice Blue,I was so stunned... I don't think I'll read anything longer than a short story in the coming time... This book truly is life-changing.
34,Paulo F. Oliveira,"As I do like the theme of society and science (political) fiction a lot, I easily came to love this book. 1984, one of George Orwell's finest books, is not as much fiction as I would like it to be. Throughout the time I was reading the book I used to have interesting discussions, with a friend of mine, about its contents and we got to ask ourselves ""how far away from the truth and the present is it?""... how, for example, can we relate its contents to the current status of North Korea? It's already frightening to imagine Orwell's vision come true, so it must be even harder to live it.From the very first moment, we're presented with a society that lives in fear, being constantly watched, closed from the outside world and basically ""all-controlled"". I could identify with Orwell's sense of humor in the description of the political analysis of the society itself, and kept thinking about what such a society puts out there as initial signs. How did the nazis come to prominence, how did the Khmer Rouge came to happen, how did my own country (Portugal) find itself in a dictatorship that lasted for 40 years. You'll think about all of this and much more, the book is as layered as you want it to be... big brother, doublethink, newspeak, crimestop, control, fear, despair, sexual repression, crazy nationalism... This is a work that already has inspired so many others and in a time that seems so long ago, but it is still so fresh! And I really also wanted Newspeak to be better developed as a concept (only a few references appear in the book actually)...Winston is a hero, Julia is not; Julia is the rebel that the system wants to create (she uses the system as much as she hates it, but she has no real intentions of battling it). Winston is the hero the system wants to know how to prevent, how to destroy. Many are the questions, few are the answers... at a certain point in the book, Winston asks himself about the whys, because he understands the hows. It's much the same for the reader, I guess.At the end of the book I also kept thinking about ""Big brother is watching you""! I understood it in two ways: you are being controlled (1) and Big brother is looking out for you (2): that's what the Party wanted you to believe, any way. That it was working for you, not the other way around, and that it was providing you with everything you needed.And everybody so does love Big Brother!"
35,Stephen Curran,"I can't think of an opening chapter that does so much heavy lifting, introducing so many striking ideas, and so efficiently: ideas that have become embedded in our language. So much is there in the first ten pages: Big Brother, telescreens, Newspeak, Airstrip One, the Ministries of Truth/Peace/Love, Two Minutes Hate, doublethink. A whole world laid out, as befits a book where, for its lead character, 'the end is contained in the beginning'.It's one of those novels that I wish I could read for the first time again. One of the things that I had forgotten in the intermediate years is quite how brutal it is. The final fifth - after the trap is sprung and betrayals are revealed - is unrelenting. Winston Smith is broken down in the most extended, horrific and absolute way. It is genuinely shocking. Nothing else in fiction matches it."
36,Nastya Samokhina,"Astonishing and powerful work, which, beyond making me think about all these awful things, also gets you right there, so you live through this heartless people by the eye of Big Brother. '1984' has many similarities with 'We' by Zamyatin, who has written his anyiutopia earlier with the experience of Russian communism.Absolutely nedd-to-read book. Thrilling, unpredictable, the one you feel sorry for. Amazing"
37,Jon Alette,"Äntligen har jag läst George Orwells beryktade roman. 1984 levde upp till alla förväntningar, och lite mer därtill. Det väckte en revolutionär Jon. Jag kunde nästan känna mig själv bli arg över FRA-lagen och övervakningssamhället, i efterhand. Jag har aldrig brytt mig om de förändringar som skett, jag har aldrig besvärats av kameror, eller bevakning av dataflöde; men när jag läser om Winstons liv i Oceania blir jag rädd, och lite upprörd. Jag tänker verkligen inte leva i en sådan värld.Det är ett nöje att läsa boken och på efterhand få hitta de intertexter som finns i moderna verk, som V for Vendetta, eller Equilibrium. Storebror. Storebror ser dig. Diktatorn som inte riktigt finns, men ändå ser dig överallt. Det superauktoritära staten, rädslan för dina egna tankar, och faktumet att du inte har rätt till dem. Hela konceptet är tänkvärt, och ständigt aktuellt. Även i livet vi lever idag måste man passa sig för sina egna tankar; man måste ständigt vara på sin vakt för moraliskt förfall, om inte av rädsla för statlig bestraffning, så för konsekvenser i den sociala umgängeskretsen. Ständigt stöps vi in i kulturellt betingade former, steget från kulturellt till politiskt ter sig inte vara så stort. Känslan som man får av Winstons liv, där han inte vågar ta ett steg utanför de vanliga banorna, av rädsla för att bli upptäckt, leder tankarna till sitt eget liv, och hur man kollar snett på de som gör någonting okonventionellt. Givetvis finns det grupper som kan bryta de flesta normer utan att det förefaller konstigt, men för den hederlige människan (medlemmen i partiet) vore det väldigt konstigt att befinna sig på fel ställe, eller göra någonting som står utanför normen. Den stora skillnaden är att bestraffning inte infinner sig. Boken kom som en språklig semester för mig. Eftersom den följde Dracula i ledet var det ett rent nöje att läsa den. Men Newspeak, ger boken en helt ny språklig dimension. Det används inte nämnvärt flitigt i den löpande texten, men diskussionen av fenomenet ger hela boken en lingvistisk prägel. Det skapar en diskussion om ordets makt, och vad som händer om man skulle försöka ta bort ordets makt. Vad händer om du tar bort all förmåga att uttrycka känslor, värderingar eller orginella tankar? Det känns som att Newspeak inte skulle fungera i praktiken, men tanken är intressant. Genom att Orwell nämner det nya språket lite då och då uppmärksammar man den vanliga engelskan mycket mer. Genom att begrepp som Doublethink presenteras, börjar man reflektera över engelskan synonymer, och vilken funktion de har. "
38,Jon,"Find this review at Scott Reads It""Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two is four.""To say 1984 is an amazing and powerful novel is the understatement of the century. Never have I ever read a book so powerful and meaningful. 1984 is a book that transcends time because 1984 will always be pertinent. Orwell created a timeless tale about power, freedom, and social classes. No review I could ever write could do 1984 justice but I shall try.1984 is a dystopian novel complete with action, romance, and politics. I'll be honest here. Normally I don't read serious literature and I hate politics. Reading 1984 was me metaphorically ""putting on my big boy pants"" , it showed how my reading taste matured. Enough about me, this is a review not the Scott show! The plot moves at such a brisk pace and you'll be glued to your seat. Even if you hate politics like my teenage self you will love 1984. Orwell creates political situations that will allure even the most unwilling readers. There are few dull moments in 1984, the majority of whom take place in ""the book"".No 1984 review could ever be complete without mentioning Oceania. Oceania is the totalitarian society in which 1984 takes place and I know where I'm not going on vacation. Oceania makes Panem look like a walk in the park and it is far more horrible than I expected. No sane person could go live there without going insane because it's a living hell. Orwell really created the perfect hell-hole for his masterpiece and it's mindblowing.I really loved how Orwell created his own language ""Newspeak"" for 1984. Newspeak added an interesting feel to the novel because it further the novel's themes and motifs. I really wonder if aficionados of 1984 speak Newspeak like trekkies speak Klingon and LOTR fans speak Elvish. Orwell definitely spent a lot of time coming up with Newspeak and I do appreciate his efforts.1984 is a haunting novel that once you read it, it will stay with you forever. I won't ever be able to forget the horrifying Part III because how powerful and moving it was. 1984 is a novel that will make you question yourself and society. The best kind of books make you think even after you finish and such is the case with Orwell's masterpiece. The 3rd person narration instead of hindering the pacing, it enhances it by adding more emotional depth to the book.1984 is a novel that will give you new perspectives on people, society, and law. Is Ignorance really bliss? Is lying okay if it's for the greater good? Is the needs of the many more important than the needs of the few? I can tell why 1984 is considered classic literature and I hope it continues to be read for it's important messages. Even if 1984 doesn't seem like your thing, I'd still recommend giving it a shot. 1984 has given me a reason to pick up Animal Farm and I hope I enjoy it as much as I enjoyed 1984."
39,Caitlin Babinciuc,"I have heard a many good things about this book while in college and after I started a book club for ESL students in my city, I decided, ""why not read this one?"" I might as well find a reason to read books besides telling myself that I'm TOO busy (don't we all...). I loved this book! At times it was slow but the underlying tones and ideas are what kept me going. And not just kept me going to the end, but made me want to finish it all in a weekend! The ideas of social classes in 1984 and of how to control a population really opened my eyes to different possibilities I had never thought of before. So, to all those who enjoy books, like ""The Next 100 years"" or any futuristic/political novels, this is the one for you!"
40,Arah-Leah Hay,"What to say about 1984...hmm.. its endless. I was completely captivated and terrified all at the same time. This book has a way of creeping up on you and seeping in. It is without doubt ahead of its time and completely timeless at the same time. I really felt while reading it, it could have been written yesterday. It is not an easy read by any stretch but one that you should take your time with as to completely absorb its brilliance, terrifying as it is. I agree with the masses...this book should be read by everyone. It is an important piece of literature that may always bear relevance to today and our government. I loved it!"
41,Vasco,http://cronicasdeumaleitora.blogspot....
42,Sandy,"Let me preface my review by saying that I'm not much of a political person. I vote in every major election, and I try really hard to vote in all local elections, and I'll vote in primaries if it's convenient. I'm very opinionated when it comes to issues that I feel affect my rights to live my life as I wish, but that's about it. So, that being said, 1984 isn't a book that normally would top my list of books I'm dying to read, but I had quite a few people recommend it and it's one of those books that made me feel like an ignoramus for not having read (you know those books, where people wonder what kind of high school you went to if you never read X in English class...).Once I started 1984, I could barely put it down. I was immediately drawn into the story, and found myself engrossed in wondering how this society could have gotten to the point where they allowed the government to spy on them constantly. Everything about this book was fascinating, and I kept thinking that copying this sentence or that sentence and re-posting it on my Facebook status would spark some interesting discussions.As a side note, I was a little surprised at the frank discussion of human sexuality in this book, especially considering that it was written in the 1940s. While it was weak compared to what would be considered acceptable nowadays, it was still more than I was expecting. However, I think it was absolutely crucial to the story and handled in a very tasteful way.Overall, I absolutely loved this story. I think that everyone in America needs to read it, given our current governmental tendency to squash any right that people will even consider giving up in the name of safety, equality, or some other utopian, but unattainable, ideal."
43,Ali Al-Marhoon,اعتقد ان عظمة هذه الرواية وسر بقاءها طرية كل هذه السنين مذ كتبها جورج اورويل، ليس وصفها لحال المجتمع الاوقياني بما يشبه احوال كثير من المجتمعات التي عانت او لاتزال من حكم شمولي مستبد .. عظمتها في حبكة الصراع بين المنطق السليم على بساطته والمنطق الأعوج على بساطة فضحه .. الحزء الأخير حيث الصراع بين ونستون والمحقق على بديهيات عقليه كان قمة في تصوير خطر ان يعبث احدهم بهذه البديهيات مهما كانت قوته وسطوته .. ذلك ان الانسان مفطور على التمسك بحقيقة أن 2+2=4 رغم محاولة فلسفة النتيجة بالقهر او الاقناع

Club de Lectura, Libro #3 Junio 2015
Este libro es tan impresionante! Es como la mamá de todos los libros distópicos que he leído en mi vida.Yo normalmente me obsesiono con cosas menos serias, pero 1984 me enganchó como cualquier novela teen. Sinceramente, no se que más decir. Es imposible criticarlo. Esta lectura fue mucho mejor para mi que Rebelión en la Granja, que me la lei como hace 5 años cuando no sabía nada de historia ni política. La sensación que deja un libro como estos es de desconsuelo, paranoia y rabia, prácticamente entre en crisis existencial, pero valió la pena!Aunque sinceramente esperaba un final menos desesperanzador. Digamos que yo todavía tengo el cerebro programado en modo Disney y me niego a no creer en los finales felices. No es que tenga un final triste, es en realidad el que me esperaba, pero yo todavía creo en la revolución! Me lo leí en dos días, mientras estaba en la playa y al terminarlo todas las paginas se habían caído, así de agresiva me sentía con este libro...Hasta ahora es el mejor libro que hemos escogido en el club, por las discusión que generó se podría decir que ya le subimos el status al grupo de club de lectura a movimiento capucho.

47,Sarah (saz101),"School wasn't a happy time for me. The bonds I had to my friends felt always tenuous, and it was many a lunchtime I spent holed up in the library, searching for something new. There was no Goodreads, then. The internet was new and exciting, and online communities were a thing I'd not encountered--Aaah, writing this, I feel quite old.I wonder how Orwell would feel, because his seminal novel, 1984 was well before its time, but the year it takes its name from has long since past. It past the year I was born, in fact.Moving on: My friends weren't big readers, but my mum and dad were. I devoured their book collections, and my tastes became theirs: epic fantasies, chilling sci-fi. They and their books taught me to question; to think for myself. I'm not surprised now to see my tastes ran in vein of politically subversive, and with that in mind, it seems inevitable I found myself one lunchtime with this book in my hands.There's something special about the book you discover for yourself. My mother and father may have led me to a love of reading, but it was I who chose to keep seeking, and it was I who picked this book.As a fifteen year old, 1984 changed my life. It's left an indelible mark on the adult I've become, and, while perhaps it's not healthy ('paranoid' and 'distrustful' come closer), it's shaped how I've grown to view politics, and how the people who govern our world do so.Armed with the knowledge of 
doublethink
 and 
thoughtcrime
, the world was a different place for me, and for the very first time, I grew to see the world outside me in more than just black and white, and to reject the absurdity of 
blackwhite
.1984 did not make me an activist, or a radical – I can make no such great claim. It did teach me to think for myself, to question; it reinforced the foundations my parents laid. So this isn't a review, not really. Just a chance to say how much this book means to me, and hope it will to you, too. "

51,Matthew,"I had not read ""1984"" until now -- I wish that it had been assigned in high school, or maybe college. The afterword (in this edition) by Erich Fromm demonstrates just how applicable Orwell's warnings were to the era of the 1960s, and it is easy to see how applicable those could be to my own generation's experiences since the 1980s. It is also amazing to recognize just how much ""pop culture"" has drawn from this novel. Of course, now it almost seems that governments have been using Orwell's conceptualization of the surveillance state as a ""how-to guide"" (an idea which I must attribute to someone else on Twitter, though I cannot remember now who that was, and though I wish I had thought of it myself). At any rate, in prescient comparison with the realities of history, this novel stands well the test of time."
52,Miriam Stern,"My head. My poor poor head.Forget any other dystopians because ""1984"" is the epitome of what a dystopian society is. Good God, I feel like I'll never be the same. War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength. Only when you have come to understand these terms and yet reject them completely and utterly can you possibly understand what 1984 represents. If we are to absorb the book, the world is but an illusion, society is a lie, and we are reigned, unbeknownst to us, by Big Brother. Who is Big Brother is unimportant. What truly matters is what he represents. And the sheer ideology of the Party and what it, in itself, represents, goes beyond.How did Orwell manage this? I am blown away. This book is just, again, mind-blowing. "

55,MercMel,"Launching an era of braindead libertarians who believe roads and bridges are naturally occurring phenomena, this terrifying depiction of a totalitarian government just scarred me like no other book. At times it is too dreadful to even read, but like 2 Girls 1 Cup, you feel oddly compelled and dared. This is not a horror novel in the sense of what doesn't exist, but what does completely have the capability to exist in the 21st century. That is true terror. The thought of having no freedom to love, make love, have an opinion, and being monitored at all times is deeply unsettling. Unless you're into being watched, then this world is a dream come true. This harrowing masterpiece should be taught in schools for all as a warning to not be overcome by Big Brother or poor people/minorities who start these revolutions in the first place.There are a few bland spots, countless pages of exposition, and you can skip those as it is just normal ""mwahaha"" overlord propaganda shit. But the actual story of Winston and Julia, each half a rebel, Julia being the lower, is sad, guilt-ridden, and red-faced shame. If I told you to agree that your mother is a vapid whore who hustles for Walgreens coupons, and Ron Paul is master of the universe,(or if there is a God to begin with) you would laugh or dismiss. But if I had a gun pointed at you, cornered in an alley with no escape or cellphone, and closed in on you a little bit more and a little bit more, all throughout history, anything is so, isn't it? Exactly Orwell's point. For my money, 1984 is the greatest fiction novel of all time. It is full of interesting literary concepts like ""doublethink"", blended continents, and a perpetual war backdrop are just the poison paint frosting on the cake. It is really about the will of man to live and how it can be suppressed, and it pulls no punches even toward the end.

58,M. Ashraf,"This is a work of art, one of the best thing I've ever read!!! It was shocking, frightening, interesting,Amazing work of fiction of all time. To know it was written in the forties and it gave meaning/invented the word Big Brother, doublethink, newspeak ... It was great and Thank God this didn't happen...It makes you appreciate what you have.. at the same time concern about modern day Big Brother and the eye in the sky to know that we are being watched every minute of everyday everywhere, propaganda is played constantly on every t.v so are we being played??? I know that many thing in our history is falsified comparing what is written in our history books and the worlds book, there is always discrepancies...something isn't right. We need a true change, not another party seeking power controlling the present thinks he could alter the history again to control our future... Here in Egypt, we almost had what was happening back then and our rise was by the middle class and most of the ""proles"" and we removed a tyranny but as it happens the brotherhood that came after it wanted to establish the same tyranny... this time I hope we wont let it happen.. and we will remember that 2+2=4 not 3 not 5 not all of them... 
WAR IS PEACE.FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past

59,Dylan Gardner,"George Orwell once again creates a deeply disturbing world that is both plausible and terrifying. What's even more terrifying about the plot is that almost every aspect of 1984 is plausible. The story begins with a low ranking official named Winston. Winston is deeply dissatisfied by the state of affairs in the nation of Oceania, the novel's setting. Though most of the population is indoctrinated into the belief that the party can do no wrong, Winston easily sees through this vacuous facade. Though he hates the party, he is in no position to rebel. This is because the nation of Oceania uses a secret police called the thought police to monitor its civilian population. In the nation of Oceania, not even your thoughts are your own. As the story progresses, Winston starts to find more and more ways to rebel against the party. One thing that I really enjoy about 1984 is its ability to create characters that are extremely human. Winston is a great example of this. Winston has desires just like every other human. The human aspects of the characters in this novel make it all the more believable. I also enjoy how the book creates a setting that is dynamic and engaging. Orwell goes into very rich detail on every aspect of Oceania. Overall, this George Orwell novel is one my personal favorites. Its blending of Sci-fi and political fiction gives it a perfect mix of fantasy and reality. I would recommend 1984 to anyone who wants to familiarize themselves with the dystopian genre."
60,yerazness,"Herkesin okuması gereken, muhteşem bir kitap. "
61,Alex Palmer,"1984 By George Orwell is a classic dystopian novel, eerily prescient of the state of modern society. Winston Smith, the main character, tries to rebel against Big Brother. Big Brother is a symbol of Oceania’s government. As the titular head of Oceania, he is always watching. No one knows if he really exists, but he keeps the people in line. Through the whole book Orwell uses surveillance and strict laws to show how intense of a society occupies Oceania. As a reader, it makes me think about how our society doesn’t even scratch the surface of how bad the people of Oceania have it, and we are very fortunate for the way we live. We as a society are allowed to keep a journal to write in. If you are caught with a journal in Oceania, the consequences can be severe as death! If you are into dystopian literature or even just a timeless classic, I would strongly suggest 1984."
62,Rena Jiang,"“1984” written by George Orwell is a political novel to describing a society under the rule of a dictatorship. Orwell perfectly portrays a totalitarianism and authoritarian government through the perspective of a 39-year-old man, Wilson. Wilson lives in a society similar to those Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, where there is no freedom and the government holds both physical psychological control over people. The government controls history and language, constantly monitoring people and suppressing any possible sign of rebellion.1984 emphasizes how control over the human mind or psychological manipulation is the ultimate power, which is obtained through physical control and torture. This novel, written in the 1940’s, serves with the purpose to warn people of the dangers of a government as such. Orwell uses many concepts and symbols throughout the book to reference to the real-world situation at the time, like an extended metaphor. The novel plot is extremely engaging and Orwell writes in an easy-to-understand manner. However, the underlying meaning of his texts is what truly makes this novel fascinating."
63,Kevin W,"Honestly, I don't even know what to do after finishing this book except stare at the ceiling."
64,Stephanie,"I discovered and first read this book in 1984 (at 17, I thought that was just SO clever and ironic). And I adored it, as much as one can adore a vision of a dystopian future.Weirdly enough, the thing that attracted me to this book was the language, or the lack thereof. I've always been fascinated by language, hungry for words at an early age. My favorite book as a young grade-schooler was The Reader's Digest Encyclopedic Dictionary.So the concept of limiting the growth of such a living, breathing, ever-changing entity was quite disturbing to me. I loved how 1984 made me ponder the concept that limiting words = limiting thoughts. Hmmm...is that why we've got the ultra-conservatives barring legislators from using the word ""vagina"" in Congress? There's a thought.I could say so much more (and perhaps will, at a later time) but for now I'll just say it is a prescient novel, especially today, when it is becoming downright frightening how much ""Big Brother"" is intruding (or attempting to intrude) into our most private decisions. Read it, but most of all, DISCUSS it. Using our confusing, lovely, unruly, yet unlimited LANGUAGE."
65,aPriL does feral sometimes,"When I was in high school I believed this was a totally impossible premise, now I think it could totally happen if we let Fox News or CNN control the message completely. The first political book I understood, but the tech to make this real is here now."
66,Benjamin Little,"This is definitely one of my favorite books. I read it first as a child and it is largely responsibly for my fascination with dystopian stories.I have read several other reviews that find this novel to be favored by people paranoid about the government or find the ideas to no longer be relevant; and I could not disagree more strongly. I believe the totalitarianism warned of in this novel is a constant threat to our society and this book acts as a strong warning. Certainly, the themes now seem less prophetic as we have seen the end result of many of the political powers that lead to the future of Big Brother government. However, from the stance of 1953 looking forward 31 years, Orwell's point is still valid. His commentary is about direction, not destination. There are still McCarthy like figures in positions of power and the boundaries are always shifting around where we ""draw the line"" with things like domestic spying. Orwell makes comments on control, and if our foreign and domestic policies as of 2008 are any signal, humanity is still obsessed with control. (Just as a side note, the options are not binary. I am not suggesting that Orwell was an anarchist.)For the fact that this novel is still relevant makes it of the utmost interest to me. It seems to wrap commentary on human nature into commentary on politics through a largely illustrative story. 1984 is at the core of what I consider literature canon that should be a part of everyone's education."
67,Dominique,"1984 was required reading in high school; I was not particularly moved by the writing style, and at the time the voice of the author was what made or broke a book for me. But I remember very vividly being 17 and sitting at my ma's kitchen table, I felt physically queasy from a passage of this book- it was a torture scene between Winston and O'Brein. I had to walk outside and get some air. I went to the woods and finished the novel. How could this be? Winston was supposed to win. Maybe not overthrow the party, but he was supposed to get the girl and escape somehow. He didn't. His spirit was broken. He gave up Julia under torture and brainwashing. He stopped questioning and complied, in the end. I had the wind knocked out of me, with this book. 1984 has come and gone since Orwell's publication. I didn't know it at the time, but this book planted within me a seed of distrust for which I am eternally grateful. In this world, they alter their history. They manipulate language to make rebellion impossible. Are there parallels between this world and our own? I'm still trying to figure that part out, but I have to thank this book for disturbing my comfortable compliant mind and making trust all the more precious."
68,Elizabeth Riquelme villalobos,"Impresionante obra de tinte político que describe una sociedad futurística, régimen controlador, totalitarista y que su función principal es controlar el pensamiento, eliminar las emociones y los lazos afectivos, que se asemeja en su estructura y lenguaje increíblemente a la política venezolana actual, sobre todo las torturas, los cambios del lenguaje, el tratar de cambiar el pasado (la historia) y las incoherencias dichas por sus partidarios. A pesar que es una obra de ficción sus personajes principales, el Gran Hermano, Goldstein entre otros, son basados en personas que existieron en varios gobiernos dictatoriales del pasado. La trama se basa en un hombre normal, perteneciente al partido exterior (que viene siendo la clase media) que un día descubre que todo es una farsa y va en contra del sistema, enamorándose a escondidas y decidiendo convertirse en contrarrevolucionario, parte de ""La Hermandad"" dirigida por Goldstein. No se puede comentar gran cosa más sin decir toda la trama, sin embargo es totalmente recomendablepág 326"
69,Chadi Nanaa,Sir Orwell was a visionary and 1984 may have been the most visionary book !
70,Beatrice,"1984 is set in an extremely frightening dystopian world where violence is rampant in the minds of children and grown men dedicate themselves to changing the past through false documentation. The Thought Police is everywhere save the darkness, and telescreens watch your every move. I was mesmerized by this story, developing a near hatred of Big Brother myself, as well as a sharpened fear of the potential power of government. George Orwell has created a world with its own political conflicts and extremeties, and yet in the reality of my mind it exists, in the particular way of Big Brother, alongside our own."

72,Muhammad Fadel,"1984 was Orwell political prophecy written in 1949 to narrate what life would be in 1984. 1984 writing seemed influenced by Orwell background as an army, and his hatred to Totalitarian regime.This book content about one man life and thought toward Totalitarian regime and how is trying so hard to be free from it, from the party who rule the country he lived in. Imagine a government, where it forbid you to have sexual feelings (you are allowed to give birth but no with no intimacy, kids are being used to continue party heredity), where it will crime you for thinking, where it put a screen everywhere to monitor your action, your words, where you will be perished if you are against the party, where it always alter the past like it was alterable It was so intense to read how Winston try to seek freedom towards it, where it finally he make love with a girl who also loves him purely even when they know it is forbidden. Until the end, even until he finally captured, he never stops speak to what he believe, that one day totalitarian regime that the party fought for, would collapse. That even tough the party says they do it because they love their members, no human beings could stands lonely knowing their instinct was caged. One day they will revolt to get it back.But after all, perhaps one need not to be loved, as much he needs to be understood. And I agree with it."
73,Engy,"It is the world of lies! a world where every record has been destroyed, and every book has been re-written, every picture has been repainted, and every statue, street, building, has been re-named, every date has been altered to the extent that you can't determine in which year you are living!! nothing exist except what the party see that it's true, the past is falsified, and the irony here, is that the ""ministry of truth"" is the one who's responsible for this, even the language is altered and the ""new speak"" is used instead, you are watched through endless number of telescreens, found every where and the watchful eyes of the big-brother, and if any body dares to think, he will not escape the hands of the thought-police that will vanish him -""un person"" !!- it's when Winston decided to stand against this totalitarian regime, when he discovered his true identity when he fell in love with Julia...the amazing piece here is that George Orwell has written this novel in 1948! but as if he is describing our media and the totalitarian regimes that controls us and try to picture itself as democratic ones."
74,Sher,"I read this book a long, long time ago, but couldn't remember it at all so I decided to reread it. I am sure my life experiences and the perspective that comes with time have turned it into a much better book than I remembered it being. I found myself rooting for Winston, praying that he would have the strength of character to stand up and be the catalyst for change in this futuristic society, but he was so trapped on every side that he seemed to have no choice but to capitulate. The scary thing to me is that I get it. I understand it. Is our society headed in such a direction? It is my opinion that we will never go that far, but it is perplexing to me how many people are willing to give up their free agency little by little, of their own free will and choice. I don't want anyone else making my decisions, thank you. Yes I will make mistakes, sometimes bad ones, but this is my life to live the way I see fit, not anyone else's, least of all some nameless guy known only as ""Big Brother."" There is so much in this book for all of us to learn. Right now the biggest thing I am taking away from this book is gratitude for the freedoms I have left in this country, and for my own free will. It is and should be my most highly prized possession. I'm thinking that preserving our free agency is an underlying reason why God sent his Son to die for us. It's that important."
75,karim,"""Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.""This book might, indeed, be more relevant today than any other book you can think of. This book, published in 1949, prospected a terrible future in which the party controlled the souls of its inhabitants and thus had full control over hatred and love. At first I thought the party's slogans were ridiculous, but somehow Orwell's explanation made sense. Yes, war might sustain peace, and yes.. Freedom might be slavery and indeed, somehow ignorance is strength.Somehow it taught me lots of life lessons.10/10 I would read it again. "
76,cindy,"Imagine that the world we lived was divided into 3 major ruler, all totalitarian. As long as we remembered, we believed, we always been at war, with one or the other. There were no such thing as freedom, not to act, not to lived, not to loved, not to speak, not even to think. All were directed from the Party for the sake of the Party. WAR IS PEACEWar is not strugling for power. The wars were for cheap labour (and get this, Indonesia Archipelago was one of the slaves factory!!!). But then again, the labour of the exploited peoples round the Equator is not really necessary to the world’s economy.... (but) to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. (p 238-239). When people had very scarce to eat, they will had to depended to the Party, and had no time to think other things. By this term, order and peace could be achieved.FREEDOM IS SLAVERYHuman being is mortal. To achieve to most highest peak of freedom of the being, which is immortality, every member of the party must become one with the Party. Think as one. Do as one. (This part actually reminds me a lot of collectivism of The Borg from Star Trek Next Generation)IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHTo think and do as one with the Party, every member should neutralized by DOUBLETHINK methode, which was to accept everything ""they told us to believe"" is true, without any doubt, without realizing any inconsistency. History was being up to dated every time. People existance was being decided on the event. All of these dogma should be accepted as the way of life. If you did not, then you'll need to be ""cured"" in the Ministry of Love!***Just when I thought Animal Farm was amusingly disturbing, 1984 exceeded it by miles. Published in 1949, after the World War II and the begining of Industrial Era, this novel was -and still is- a visionary writtings. Sit on the other side of the continuum of Utopia, 1984 beseech to see the worst of ideology, and the last chapter of Part 2 was really the backbone of the whole story. In this chapter readers would see how Orwell placed his fear and given us how we could be at that place. I don't think that we could ever be there (with the internet, information highway an all, history updated is rather impossible), but the vision of that place, that kind of reign, should be known to be avoided.I would like to think that this novel was a different kind of sequel to the Animal Farm. In AF, Orwell pointed how power could be slowly corrupted to benefit oneself, in this novel, it showed how to maintain that power among some minority that were ""more equal than the others"". Some characters also similar, like the face of public enemy, Snowball in AF equal to Goldstein in 1984 or Napoleon in AF to Big Brother in 1984. But other that that, this novel, or should I say essay, is much more brave, disturbing and visionary to me."
77,Becca Hobbs,"Even as a lover of dystopian fiction, I have found George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four to be one of the most difficult book's to justify in a review because I can honestly say it's not a novel that I took pleasure in reading. Why then, does such a distressing read deserve a five star rating? A good novel invokes a reaction. I did not like the protagonist's fate but it would have been extremely unjust for Orwell to grant Winston salvation. This tyrannical vision of the future has no place for a happy ending. Big Brother's corrupt yet seemingly successful creation of society as a fabrication is supposed to leave the reader feeling uncomfortable. The party's slogan “Big Brother is Watching You” runs right down to the text's core. Ultimately, any attempt at rebellion is futile and this is what makes the Orwell's dystopian nightmare so frightening.What Orwell does manage to achieve with this book is the evocation of fear. The concepts themselves, the creation of 'Newspeak' and 'Doublethink' place the idea of the potential humanity has for corruption in your head. After reading this book, I can see that a lot of dystopian writers (especially Margaret Atwood) have used Orwell's vision as inspiration. As bleak as his writing may be, I finished the book in four days. It is one of those texts that is fascinatingly horrid, you just get drawn into the monstrosity for George Orwell is the master of dystopian fiction."
78,Naoufelix,timeless...regimeless...Amazingly insightful...A must read
79,Cody Lasko,Mandatory reading if ever there was such a thing (ironic to make such a statement about Orwell's lasting masterpiece given its subject matter that's for sure!)
80,"Paulo ""paper books always"" Carvalho","I've read George Orwell - 1984. This was an odd book... It had far more information than the movie and it let us readers understand more of the world he live on... I Like the novel and would advice anyone to read it... Some of the ideas that the Inner Party had were pretty good but others were pretty useless. I can see several of the ideias implemented on our world to function properly but others are almost impossible. The lack of vocabulary is a thing that would never be implemented. The writing of the history is nowadays done so it can be implemented and it works.The world itself it's in a never ending war involving three superstates. Two allied powers fighiting against the third. The book of Goldstein (the arch enemy of the state) states that each superstate is so strong it cannot be defeated even when faced with the combined forces of the other two powers. The allied states occasionally split with each other and new alliances are formed. Each time this happens, history is rewritten to convince the people that the new alliances were always there, using the principles of doublethink. The war itself never takes place in the territories of the three powers.There is one part that is very entertaining and shows how powerful is the state against the masses... Midway through the book, the alliance breaks apart and Oceania, newly allied with Eurasia, begins a campaign against Eastasian forces. This happens during ""Hate Week"" (a week of extreme focus on the evilness of Oceania's enemies, the purpose of which is to stir up patriotic fervour in support of the Party), Oceania and Eastasia are enemies once again. The public is quite abnormally blind to the change, and when a public orator, mid-sentence, changes the name of the enemy from Eurasia to Eastasia (still speaking as if nothing had changed), the people are shocked and soon enraged as they notice all the flags and banners are wrong (they blame Goldstein and the Brotherhood) and tear them down. This is the origin of the idion, ""we've always been at war with Eastasia."" Orwell's book explains that the war is unwinnable, and that its only purpose is to use up human labour and the fruits of human labour so that each superstate's economy cannot support an equal (and high) standard of living for every citizen.Goldstein's book hints that, in fact, there may not actually be a war.Even Eurasia and Eastasia themselves may only be a fabrication by the government of Oceania, with Oceania the sole undisputed dominator of the world. On the other hand, Oceania might as well actually control only a rather small part of the world and still brainwash its citizens into believing that Oceania dominates the whole Earth or - as in the novel - that they are battling/allying with (a fabricated) Eurasia/Eastasia.Then there is the key word of the book... Doublethink that is explained as followed :The keyword here is blackwhite. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink. Doublethink is basically the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.I would advice this book to anyone... This book relates much more than the totaliarism state but also the power of our mind and the power to change our mind. The main story of the two characters is psychological intense. It made me shiver and think of life and our feelings... they are all fabricated in our mind."
81,Rawda Ahmed,"1984 عبقرية مذهلة !!نهاية الرواية مؤلمة للغاية و صادمة بالنسبة لى ! قد توقعت أو أملت فى نجاح أفكار ونستون و سقوط الحزب و الأخ الكبير و لكن العكس حدث , أو لنقل الواقع حدث فقد فشل نضال ونستون و تبقى الظلم و القهر و الخداع و الفقر و التعذيب قائما كما هو بلا تغيير .يبدو أن هذا سيناريو ما بعد الثورات فالتاريخ يعيد نفسه و الرواية تحاكى واقعنا بشكل مذهل !أعتقد أنها أفضل رواية قرأتها لأفضل كاتب :)"
82,Oumayma  Rhayem,"I've been delaying writing a review about this novel because I don't know yet how to feel about it. When I layed my hands on the book for the first time , i felt the joy of a little child given a cookie fresh out the oven , still chewy and gewy . Yes I was that excited , so much that i must have read the first page several times before turning to second page. Moving on now! The first part was so melancholic set in a dystopian world , well the city of londen to be exact , where Gin is bad , chocolate tastes like dust and your kids would tell on you if you desobey the government. Our beloved protagonist WINSTON SMITH struggles in this world trying to rebel against the rules and simply make ""2+2"" equals four . In this part It was a stuggle for me to move forward , new terms ,rules and different nerf-wrecking standards which constantly left me on the edge . I can't describe how much I hated reading it or how many times I threw the damn book , at a point I thought about giving up and putting back ,but I gave it a chance and I thank god i did for the second part was the best thing I have ever read in my life ,I thought maybe there is hope for LOVE to bloom in this dark swamp, I enjoyed reading the story of Julia and Smith , it was the climax of this book, because suddenly the pages were less pale and the words drifted smoothly. That's when Mr Orwell intervened to set the scenarios i've planed for the couple on fire and to remind me that this is not a love story . Now the last part of the novel is all about frustration , I felt really unconfortable as the events took an insupportable course. My heart sank , my blood rushed with irritating fury , and then there was pain , pain ,pain ,pain, pain and at a certain point, submission. The strange thing about that is the amount of pleasure which was induced throughout the last part . I never wanted it to end. How could you hate something yet you love it tremendously ? ....Doublethink ."

84,Atenea217,"There are so many things I could say about this book. I found it extraordinary as a work of fiction, but mostly as an essay of reality. Being from a pseudo-communist country, it's very troubling to see how things that sound as crazy and unrealistic can actually be very accurate; their actions and tactics. The thing about this book is that, while it may seem exaggerated to those without the experience, it really is not. The lies that at the beginning seem so easy to detect, become such a part of daily life that pointing them out is sacrilege and so everyone becomes part of the whole big lie, those who believe it and those who don't, and fear and uncertainty is always in the air.Many people believe the lies mainly because they are easy to manipulate, others because they don't know any better, others are so full of anger about themselves that they WANT to believe someone else is guilty of their misery. Blaming someone else is always easy, and it works for those in charge. In communist regimens there's always got to be a culprit (usually in a land far away, so no one can catch them), because otherwise, without the strength that hatred provides, people couldn't stand the weight of the vicissitudes the regimen places over them. This book was very interesting as story, yes. But also stressful and saddening in a way only stories linked to reality can be. For me, it was very much a description of what we're living."

86,Phil Laurette,"One of the best books I have ever read. The themes presented in this book are as relevant today as they were when the book was first published. Being watched by the government all the time is scary in fiction but we somehow accept it in real life. When the NSA has the ability to watch AS YOU TYPE on your computer, take over control of your web cam and listen in on your phone conversations it is a clear violation of our right to privacy - yet we aren't all outraged. I had a teacher who once told the class that the cable box was outfitted with a camera and microphone so they could watch you and listen to you at home. He was lying to get us to think about it but there were more than a few of us who went home and disassembled the boxes to be sure. If the book doesn't scare you, you should be afraid of how far gone you are."

88,Lobdozer,"Nineteen Eighty-four is widely considered to be a classic and rightly so. Not a lot of science fiction books manage to stay both this relevant and this readable for over half a century after their first publication. Nineteen Eighty-four tells the story of Winston Smith, a middle-class office drone who chafes at his pointless life of drudgery under the nightmarish InSoc regime. This regime, lead by the mysterious Big Brother, may well be the ultimate dictatorship; it manipulates the hearts and minds of its subjects with such skill that its authority is truly absolute. Winston desperately tries to free himself, even if in only the smallest way, from the yoke of Big Brother. When he falls in love for the first time in his life and joins a fledgling resistance movement, it seems that he has finally succeeded at secretly defying InSoc and Big Brother. Or has he?The way Orwell has designed his dystopian dictatorship and the way he plays with perception and information is truly impressive. His fictional world is at the same time incredibly well crafted and frighteningly believable. This is one of those novels which actually fully deserve their status as a classic, and I can recommend it to both science fiction lovers and to those who don't normally like this genre. Yes, it's that good."
89,Chibivy,"Perhaps one of the most popular and influential English-language novels in the 20th century, Nineteen Eighty-Four is part of the landmark dystopian fictions in all world literature. With the ingenious creation of a haunting world comprising of “Newspeak,” “doublethink,” and “Big Brother,” it warps the utopian novel form, describing instead a frightening society where everything has gone wrong. George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four warns humanity about the doom that could befall them when the society exchanges individuality, freedom, and love for the false securities of peace, law, and order manufactured by a totalitarian and oppressive government.Nineteen Eighty-Four is a science-fiction novel that recreates an authoritarian world divided in three massive superstates—Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia—which are constantly in war between each other. The former city of London, now called Airstrip One, no longer serves as a major city in the United Kingdom; but instead it is an important part of territory of Oceania, where there is an extremely totalitarian regime based on the principles of English Socialism commonly called as “Ingsoc.” The dominant organization in Oceania is called the Party led by Big Brother, a charismatic character and an object of the people’s admiration, although his real existence is not clear or verified. Big Brother is a personification of god in a society where religion or any form of idolatry or fanaticism has been abolished. Below Big Brother is a social pyramid stratified in three basic layers: in the apex of the social pyramid is the Inner Party, composed of the elites, which serves as the “brain” of the Party; the middle part is the Outer Party which serves as the “limbs” and are therefore the working class; while at the bottom of the hierarchy are the “Proles” or proletariat which constitutes about 85 per cent of the population.The year 1984 had long passed, but four decades later, the chilling warning that George Orwell gave in his novel still echoes until now. And how could we be sure that we are not moving toward that kind of society, when the fictional dystopian world of Nineteen Eighty-Four seems to be happening in our present world: surveillance cameras are everywhere (in form of CCTVs), humanity is overwhelmed by technology and thus sometimes feel alienated in their own community, and there are on-going and brewing conflicts between nations that have been going on for years and are still not resolved until now. In a near-despairing mood about the future of humanity, Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four gives us a cautionary tale that unless the course of history changes, human beings could lose their last flicker of their most human qualities and would be instead replaced as soulless automations that are merely part of a senseless process; presenting a haunting and startling vision of a dystopian world that has been dangerously close to our current reality."

91,J.M. Cornwell,"1984 is one of those books I thought I'd read in school, but hadn't actually read. I did see the movie with John Hurt as Winston Smith and most of the language of 1984 has passed into common use, like Big Brother, thought police, thought crimes, etc. George Orwell's take on the future is powerful and clairvoyant -- and we are living a version of his constricted, hate-filled world today. Winston Smith, Orwell's protagonist, begins the book by hiding out of sight of the telescreen and writing in a diary with pen and ink purchased at different shops so as to be more difficult to track. He is writing his thoughts about Oceania and Big Brother and the world he lives in, the gray, unemotional, fear-filled world that surrounds him but does not include him. He is writing for O'Brien, a man in the inner circle of the Party, someone Winston believes is also rebelling against the status quo. As Winston continues his small rebellions, Orwell illustrates how Winston is less free than he thinks he is. Winston is merely an inconsequential cog in the wheel of The Party. Orwell paints a world where Oceania is always at war and thus always asking more of its citizens by giving them less and expecting them to accept less with equanimity because it's for Oceania, the Party, and for Big Brother. Outwardly, everyone lives the same way with oily gin, gray coveralls, and cramped quarters always in vies of the telescreens where even in the parks and countryside there are microphones to capture even the whispered confidences between lovers and co-conspirators. Children turn their parents in for what they say in their sleep that proves there is rebellion in their minds. Life is a gray, empty round of hate and fear and hopelessness, even among the proles who are not subject to the dictates of the Party because they are not allowed to be party members. The proles are serfs, slaves and belong to Big Brother as surely as do the party members.Orwell creates Winston Smith's world with simple, straightforward language, evoking a cold world full of people looking over their shoulders and clutching their small rebellions in secret. Paranoia and disgust oozes from the pages and stays with the reader long after the book is closed. Even the passages of the Book that explains the workings of The party and how Oceania, though a bit pedantic, ring with truth.While our world, this modern world, seems less gray and freer, Orwell got it right. His newspeak is our politically correct and his Big Brother is our out of control Congress and President. We don't have thought police per se, but we have a media controlled by the government that spouts the party line and an entire country of people watching and listening to pounce on the slightest misspoken word they gladly throw back in our faces for public condemnation of the miscreant. Although what we see isn't exactly like Orwell's vision, it's close enough to be frightening, knowing that wars are made and lines redrawn to give us somewhere to focus our hate when the real damage is done by the government that is supposed to support and protect us. George Orwell's 1984 is here and reading about it is frighteningly real."
92,Dinesh Ram,"Reading this book was an awful experience but not all books are meant to be enjoyed. Some are just meant to grab you by your shoulders and make you suffer as the characters do. And how I have suffered. This is one of those because which has more to give with each reading. Having read it a second time I have bumped it up from four stars to five and I am sure it will have plenty more to offer if I read it once more. But that is not going to happen. I value my sanity far too much.It presents several occasions for outrage and several others where you just want to shut the book and stare out the window at reality, your mind swimming with subtly connected analogies. Disbelief is replaced with silent horror as you realize the Party's reasoning and motives are sound. In fact this book wouldn't be as effective or believable if North Korea wasn't the way it was. The Party's ideologies which bases upon contradiction bleeds into its characters in a most natural way. The way each supporting character is perceived is butchered and rearranged by Orwell. O'Brien who receives magnanimous goodwill turns out to be the opposite. As does old Mr.Charrington. And for beloved Julie reversal occurs in the opposite direction. They all just reflect the Party's principles in the way they project themselves. This book just pushed me one step closer to becoming a person people might point to and say ""...read himself crazy."" But even if I was looked upon as crazy, is there still a chance that I might be right as a minority of one? Is sanity statistical? "
93,Sachin Bhagat,"Plus double good. An excellent novel.The weakness & helplessness of Winston is depicted as the weakness of an individual against a well established order (although corrupt, wrong). This makes one realize meek we, human, really are.So, who is this Big brother? Glodstein? or No one in general? If Goldstein is the Public enemy no. 1 why would party keep him alive in history? why don't they erase him? If there won't be anyone in records against party no one will follow the path of revolution. But there's a catch in that Party needs Goldstein to be alive and plotting against them. To feed of the fear and hatred against him.Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the future. This slogan of the party explains why the party is invincible. The rewriting of past over and over again leaves the leaves no distinction between truth and lies. And all this for POWER.Hats off to Eric Arthur Blair for such a novel."
94,Peter Tieryas,"You know what makes 1984 work better than Brave New World for me? It's the characters and their futile hope. I always thought Brave New World was the more plausible future whereas 1984 seems in many ways superseded by the amount of computer control that already exists. Winston Smith's arc is terrifying. You hope for the best and when the reality sinks in, you can't help but feel utterly crushed. I'll write more on this later."
95,Meshell,"Ever imagined yourself enjoying a dystopian book? 1984 will make you experience this feeling. It is the kind of books that you devour instead of reading yet it leaves you in the end with more questions than answers. Built around simple characters and an extremely complex political setting, 1984 tackles mainly the theme of Power and control. 2 + 2 = 5. Those who have the power can make those who don't believe in the soundness of the equation, in a world where reason, emotions and freedom have been annihilated.A visionary philosophical feature that everyone should read at least once."
96,Dominic Gullotta,"The Book 1984, By George Orwell, is a fantasy/fiction work about a dystopian civilization that leaves its citizens in the dark, which amplifies he message in which the over indulgence of power and the restriction of free will forced on citizens often can lead to a dystopian wasteland, bound to cause revolution with an oppressed society. At the time the author had written this book, it was in the middle of the boom of nationalism and patriotism in favor of capitalism as the United States had started the cold war with the USSR, who promoted socialistic values in communism, which by definition, is a governmental system of extreme power given to the government, and gives the power to regulate and control virtually everything in that nation. America was opposed to this as a nation of smaller government and based on free will and independence, which influenced many writers from both the U.S. and Britan to write books to exemplify the disadvantages of government power over its citizens.In the close future of 1984, a 39 year old man named Winston was a government worker in the ministry of truth in London, Oceania, a nation that is governed by the Party, with its leader Big Brother. All around the city of London, The people are constantly monitored by big brother and are never out of its eye. Winston, because of the constant monitoring and surveillance, has grown tired with the party and their stranglehold among the people of London, which is quickly tightening its grip as the party is forcing the new invented language known as “Newspeak” which eliminates any words or phrases that will signal any resistance or revolution. In fact, the party employs Winston to change past documents in history and eliminating any truth in the past, to make the party, Big Brother, and the injustice they are performing look more favorable in history. In response to his frustration, Winston commits a crime punishable by death by writing his resentful thoughts in a journal, which is committing thought crime, one of the worst crimes to commit as Big Brother limits the thoughts that you can express, and is punishable by death. He then engages in a love affair with a woman that shares the same feelings named Julia in secrecy, while being superstitious as to if another man, O’Brien, is a member of a group to bring down big brother, or is one of them. As time goes on, He sees Julia as a physical necessity, regardless of danger of thoughtcrime, but must keep their thoughts and love a secret, as any expression such as love or passion must be suppressed by the party. They must keep their love in secrecy, and fight the oppression of the oppressive big brother, but their struggles can be in vain.This capitalistic manifesto is very exhilarating and interesting as it provides a commentary that individuality is a needed thing in life and must not be taken away in order to keep all of the natural rights us as humans are born with, and to lose the sense of individuality is to lose ourselves into a world with no identity. I definitely agree with his messages for that reason because I strongly believe that independence is the key needed to unlock the gates of life, and if life Is not lived free, you are not living a life, you are a puppet to another. Again, since this book is written in a time when many Britons and Americans where borderline paranoid and afraid of communism finding its way into their country, so we can comfortably assume that this book tries to suggest that the possibility of a communist hold on western civilization and to warn people that they must stand with their country to save their freedom. I feel that this book as strengthened my stance on limited government influence on our citizens because it really speaks to me of the dangers of the over-extension of the hand of the ruling powers that can destroy and obliterate any part of me that separates me and my peers from a faceless regime, so I call to everybody to remember to save their individuality and pride in the fact that you have freedom in this world, as life without it may be no life at all. "
97,Emad Nadim,"Incredibly well crafted as a view of an alternate reality, the author leaves the reader with an intellectual depression like no other. "
98,Peachy,"A haunting and tragic tale of a dystopic existence under a totalitarian regime, told by one of the best political writers of our time. This is a classic that is quoted in everyday popular culture, from 'Big Brother' to NewSpeak. It's a timeless work of 'Fiction,' and is a must have for all bookshelves. I'm left pondering how Orwell would reflect on Facebook if he were here to see it?www.booksnakereviews.blogspot.com"
99,Cal Abbo,"1984 by George Orwell is a fantastic work that portrays how society could end up if we continue to be ignorant. While it is an extreme, there are already certain controlling aspects of the government that are related to this book in scary ways. Aside from the parallels drawn to the real world, it was a very enjoyable read that I would definitely recommend. Amidst all of the foreshadowing and plot twists, there were great details and vivid, intense descriptions of scenery that really connected me to the book. One of my favorite parts of this book was how Orwell implemented futuristic technology for his time, but over 50 years later, this technology is mostly possible. It's very amusing to think about how the world could have ended up if certain events had taken place, and this might be a very accurate representation of it. The vagueness of the descriptions of the rest of the world separates it from the likes of the hunger games and other books of this nature. It doesn't claim to be the only country on earth, but just a totalitarian state that may or may not be modeled throughout the rest of the world. In the end, this book deserves to be read by everyone and can offer tremendous thought-provoking ideas about the world we live in today."
100,Johanna,"1984 is an extremely sobering read that details the new political cult of Big Brother that arises in a post-war world. Under the watchful eye of Big Brother the inhabitants of Oceania have no political or personal freedom and are constantly monitored by telescreens, hidden microphones, the Thought Police, and even their own families. People commonly disappear and are erased from all records for crimes as simple as talking in their sleep. It is against this background that the reader is introduced to Winston Smith, an Outer Party member, whose job it is to rewrite public records to ensure the complete dominance of Big Brother. Although Winston appears to be a diligent and conforming party member he harbours an intense dislike of all that Big Brother stands for. He starts his rebellion by keeping a journal where he jots down his anti-semantic feelings and begins to question the plausibility of Big Brother’s statements (such as Big Brother invented the aeroplane). He soon begins an affair with Julia, a promiscuous young woman who also works for the party. As the two grow closer they try to devise ways to break away from Big Brother’s tyrannical reign. However, it is soon revealed that no one escapes the watchful eye of Big Brother.I believe that this book becomes increasingly relevant as technology advances and as people pay less and less attention to the political motives of elected representatives. The reality that mankind will one day become entrapped in a world controlled by Big Brother is all too plausible – just look at how far the Nazi’s got before the rest of the world intervened. The question of freedom and privacy and how much of either people are entitled to is a very sombre overtone in this novel. This is one of those rare books that I would recommend that everyone should read; it is eye-opening to say the least. "
101,Sebas,"I was not sure if this book deserved a 4 or a 5. I gave it a 5 because, apart from being an amazing book, I think it is amazing how someone is able to write such a dark profecy for his own world. The future described br Orewll in this book is really sad, dusty, miserable and very gray. I wouldnt wish anyone to be in a place like that.This book is very good. I would describe this book as dark. The reality created by Orwell is not what many of us would desire. But that is indeed one of the good points this book has: even if its not 'real', it is very easy to believe it and follow Winston's life. One quickly gets involved with the character. The only part I didnt like was the part where Winston finally gets Goldstein's book. It was so disapointing. I expected a revolutionary book, but it was like reading a boring economics textbook, or something of that style. It was nothing like what I expected.The end was also disapointing. I didnt expect them to overthrow the party, but at least to die in a more dign way. I dont know why but I thought they would either die under an explosion, or a bomb, or suicide together (Winston and Julia).Anyways, I completely understand why the Goldstein's book is so boring (I think it is another lie from the party to catch people who believe in revolution and have hope), and I understand why the ending is so sad and disapionting (if the ending wasnt like it is, the book would have lost all its power and meaning. Orwell had to finish his story leaving no hope!)Finally, I enjoyed it, and I would recommend this book to you. So, as I may have said before, the book was written in 3 parts:The first one is quite introductory. It shows you how the stuff works for Winston and the rest of the people. Society, the proles, telescreens, the hates, and how the dreams of revolution are not that common (nor allowed). The second part starts to show the real stuff. He finally met Julia, and they can be considered as 'rebels' , or criminals of thought. The third part was, to me, unexpected. In a way, I was hoping for a happy ending. The book portrays from the beginning a sad, grey world, and I was hopping some colour in the end. Even if it was not what I initially wanted, I think it was the right ending for the book. In the end it gives this weird message about how we wont control our thoughts and how we will lose our freedom. Enjoy it!"
102,Christina,"Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two makes four. Yet in the city of London located in Airstrip One (formerly known as Great Britain) — a province of the superstate Oceania (formerly known as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom) — men and women are denied that freedom by a political system called English Socialism, also known as Ingsoc in the government’s invented language, Newspeak. At the head of this political system is Big Brother, and Big Brother says two plus two makes five or three or, really, whatever Big Brother wants because Big Brother decides what is truth.History is controlled by the Ministry of Truth, which is where the protagonist of the novel Winston Smith works rewriting newspaper articles so the historical record always supports the current party line. Those who question Big Brother or presume to insist two plus two makes four are often turned in by their neighbors and children, persecuted for “thoughtcrimes”, and tortured by the Ministry of Love. While Oceania is in a state of perpetual war, the Ministry of Abundance continues to tell the starving masses that agricultural yields and production levels continue to climb higher and higher.Now that I have finished this novel, I’m wondering how and why I left it languishing on my to-read list for so many years. It truly is the masterpiece people claim it to be and I should not have resisted reading this novel for as long as I did.The intricacies of the political system Orwell creates is particularly thought-provoking, and I found myself pausing the audiobook so I could ponder over a small detail Winston introduces into his narration. Although the year 1984 has long since passed, the message of this novel continues to resonate today, particularly as media outlets position themselves as supportive or critical of one political party and present the historical record in a certain light to reflect poorly on the opposing political party.It is often stated that history is written by the victor, but is the record being continuously rewritten by each new regime? Is war a tool to motivate the economy? Is fear utilized by the political elite to control the masses and continue to perpetrate the need for war? Certainly, I can come up with examples to confirm the truth of all three questions in today’s society showing just how applicable the message of Orwell’s novel continues to be.This is the second audiobook I have listed to narrated by Frank Muller, but this is the first where his narration really stood out in my mind. His ability to convey Winston’s anxiety and fear with the inflection of his voice caused me to tense, to feel those same emotions that the rather stark narrative might have caused me to miss."

106,Rama,"I had tried for so long to get hold of this book and read it but then other books came my way until a friend lent it to me. It's a GREAT book that encompasses the real meaning and essence of dictatorship, brainwashing and the suffering of honest, solid people under these regimes. In short, a wonderful read (except for the Room 101 part). "
107,Luísa,"I have never, in my entire life as a reader, read something as disturbing as Orwell's ""1984"". This book made me physically and mentally uncomfortable as it showed me this world in which people have lost everything that makes us humans: autonomy, compassion, memory, individuality, rationality. One might argue that the villain in this novel would probably be Big Brother, or the Party, or O'Brien; that's just not the way I see it. To me, the greatest enemy here is power. Power, as O'Brien describes it in the book, means power over humans - their past and their thoughts. The exercise of power in ""1984"" is what crushes people's minds and what sucks humanity out of both the powerful and the powerless. In the end, it felt amazing to be disturbed by Orwell's work because it made me realise how powerful it was, and therefore how powerful dystopian literature can be. Its political and social insights, its scientific approach... Dystopians make us, readers, think about our own society and our distant (or near) future. Having said that, Winson's journey towards the loss of his humanity is one hell of a warning."

110,Meghana,"Orwell's tale of a totalitarian, dysfunctional world makes for a highly readable novel. I spent many late, enjoyable nights reading this book, feeling both revolted and fascinated, constantly obsessing over the events it described. To quote Newspeak, it was doubleplusgood!George Orwell is a master of prose and mind games, and nowhere does it come through as brilliantly as in the latter half of 1984. I was struck by Big Brother's similarities to Mao Zedong; his ""omnipotence,"" his ruthless brutalities (during China's Cultural Revolution), and the Communist Party's all consuming fight to monitor every individual's actions and choices. In that sense, Orwell's dated work is frighteningly prophetic, and resembled Jung Chang's nonfictional Wild Swans so much that I frequently experienced an unsettling sense of deja vu.This book has justified its place on the list of great literary works, and it got me thinking deeply about totalitarianism, religion, and psychology. I expect to re-read it numerous times, and I highly recommend it!"

112,David Rooker,"I read this in high school back in the neolithic era. I enjoyed it then as a distopian novel. This time I'm I still enjoyed it as literature, but too much of it hit a little close to home for modern times. I hope it is still being read and discussed in high schools across the country. It's more important than ever to heed the warnings in this new age of information."
113,Yognik Baghel,"This is a marvelous work. The story involves the depiction of a totalitarian society where everyone lives under a 24-7 surveillance of the thought police and the mental dilemmas of a person who despises this entire setup as a crude psychological joke. In the later parts of the book it becomes very interesting and appealing. It also carries an excellent monologue on  ""The theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism"" which stretches for a good 20-25 pages and is mindblowing. The last part of the novel is a psychological treatise which goes on to talk about things like solipsism, make-believe anything and the instinct of survival against fear. Yes this was the best part, Orwell dramatizes the entire scene slowly and gradually only to present the crescendo which says that beyond pain, beyond humiliation, beyond drudgery if there lies anything which will definitely break you down then it is FEAR. A must read for people interested in psychology. Also the monologue is so interesting that it has compelled me to read the works published on private property, machinery and wealth... Basically Gandhi and Marx. All in all excellent composition, simply a masterpiece."
114,Muhammad,"Ditulis 1948 sebagai ramalan utk tahun 1984? yes, but no! poinnya bukan itu. Novel ini adalah obor pemandu bagi generasi muda ditiap jaman sepanjang waktu agar mereka menyadari bahwa dilorong-lorong jaman kehidupan mereka, fasisme selalu hidup, direproduksi dan olehkarenanya berubah wajah. Jangan sampai kehilangan kemanusiaan dan menjadi gandum atau babi ternakan diladang subur fasisme. Fasisme Koptik yg dipimpin Firaun telah tenggelam di Laut Merah bersama pasukannya, tapi kemudian ia bangkit kembali di lembah Jordan, kemungkinan kini ia di lembah Silikon atau bahkan gubug darurat tepi sungai yg kotor dan bahkan ditempat tersuci sekalipun. Di imperium atau bahkan di dusun-dusun."
115,Tessa,"So, 1984 it was. When I finished this book, I had this brilliant idea of writing a long, well-thought and insightful killer-review. But whenever I sat down, starting to type, I just couldn't do it. Thoughts would rush through my brain, exploding like bombs. So I'll keep it simple: Please read this book. It will be a painful, horrible, somewhat disgusting experience. It will hurt. It may haunt you. It may scare you. Maybe it will come to your pillow. Maybe you will get a little paranoid for a couple of days, looking over your shoulder more often than you would usually do. But worst of all, it will make you question everything. And that is so important. Now, maybe more than ever. And you know what's even more worse? People told me, that they had this ""Now maybe more than ever""-thought 20 years ago. And 25 years ago. And 30 years ago. So please, read this. In it's unpleasent way, it's brilliant. "
116,Anmol Biswas,"The original masterpiece set in a dystopian future - The genre-defining work that I doubt will be eclipsed any time soon (given the preference for angsty teenage drama that has overtaken the dystopian future genre ..... eugh) and an intensely philosophical read. It's one of the top 3 books I have ever read (alongside The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged). BTW I would also love to read the book, I totally loved the two chapters that we get to read alongside Winston and was extremely intrigued but I guess George Orwell never wrote it out as a separate book (shame)."
117,Danielle,"1984 was a truly amazing piece of literature. It highlights the psychological power language has over the human mind. It outlines one major theme with which I agree completely - Language is the only limit of thought, for we cannot think what we cannot say. Semantics aside, this theme is very universal and very true. "
118,Emily Whelchel,"This book is insanely disturbing. When I was a kid, I had pet rats, but I don't know if I will ever look at them quite the same way after reading 1984. George Orwell had some kind of keen insight into the idea of dictatorship and dystopia. So many facets of this made-up culture reminded me of North Korea. The ending was so vague I'm still wondering exactly what happened. My mind was blown by this book... in a good way. "
119,Gaurav Bhutani,"1984 would send a chill up your spine at times. Summarising in one line, Orwell makes us understand and feel what freedom really is."
120,María Cabello,"Este libro al igual que Un Mundo Feliz de Aldous Huxley, nos hace ver el futuro como no quisiéramos imaginarlo. Es impresionante lo que un sistema puede hacer en la mente de alguien a través del contubernio con el gobierno y la prensa. Cuando todo un engrane de mentiras o verdades a medias se orquestan y se dirigen a la sociedad y terminan causando el efecto deseado: que la gente a pesar de ver y pensar no vean en realidad, o lo más triste, sean obligados a creer en virtud a la necesidad. Como el mismo Orwell escribió en esta obra ""La cordura no depende de las estadísticas""El final no me lo esperaba. Vale la pena leerlo. Cinco estrellitas."
121,Jacob Raymond,"I am not a fan of deep books; I usually read light stuff for fun. However, 1984 is one of the first books in a while that made me think. After finishing the last page, I had to take a time out and ponder about the nature of the human being and our society. Contrarily to all the fatalists out there, I won't say our society is like the one depicted in 1984 (at least not in the west), but still it makes me think.I think what I liked the most about this novel is how it breaks the mold. I've grown accustomed to patterns in literature. But it seems 1984 isn't normal literature. There were some shocking plot twists that legitimately surprised me and that I never saw coming (especially at the end). If I reread this novel, it will be for this reason.I read Animal Farm in grade 9 a few years ago and adored it. I now look forward to reading everything Orwell has written; he must be one of the best authors of all times in my opinion."
122,Abi,"A work of art. I was so immersed in the book I felt like I, myself, were Winston Smith. The strong willed and rebellious Winston Smith, doomed to be disagreed with, punished and crushed. I felt so much hate, hope and sorrow often all at once when reading this book... when being Winston. The worst part is, our society isn't so different. Sanity is seen as statistical. But remember: ""If there is hope, it lies in the proles""!"
123,Sara,"""The terrible thing that the party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings were of no account, while at the same time robbing you of all the power over the material world. When once you were in the grip of the party, what you felt or did not feel, what you did or refrained from doing made literally no difference. Whatever happened to you vanished, and neither you nor your actions were ever heard of again. You were lifted clean out of the stream history. And yet to the people of only two generations ago, this would not have seemed all-important, because they were not attempting to alter history. They were governed by private loyalties which they did not question. What mattered were individual relationships, and a completely helpless gesture, an embrace, a tear, a word spoken to a dying man, could have value in itself. The proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had remained in this condition. They were not loyal to the party or a country or an idea, they were loyal to one another. For the first time in his life he did not despise the proles or think of them as merely as an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world. The proles had stayed human. They had not hardened inside. They had held on to primitive emotions which he himself had to relearn by conscious effort. And in thinking this he remembered, without apparent relevance, how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbage stalk,"" (pg146)."

125,Brian,"Only a select few novels can boast of consistently placing among the literature world’s greatest reads, and of those, none possess the stark realism, vivid imaging, and chilling implication of what could be that is characteristically associated with 1984. Undisputedly, Orwell’s satirical masterpiece demonstrates the dangers of gov’t like no other, and also directly competes with novels such as Fahrenheit 451 over the idea of censorship. The weighty words conveyed by this skillful rendering of dystopia are sure to change the way readers approach gov’t, as well as the value of the past and individuality. “War is peace”“Freedom is Slavery”“Ignorance is Strength”The motto of the Party, the sole and leading political group in the continental US (now named Oceania) is evidently an oxymoron, yet further thought reveals the twisted logic behind the Party ideals. Perpetual war, instigated as a method of burning excess resources to discourage development, in turn not only keeps the population down, but also creates a period of everlasting “peace,” as both sides are far too large for any one side to ever gain a significant advantage. Freedom, more specifically freedom of the mind is quite possibly the bane of Party rule, so consequently free thought is suppressed to the point that nearly all of the populace is incapable of any deviation whatsoever. Stating that the burden of slavery entails freedom acts as a subtle warning against free thought. The elimination of all irrelevant information and overzealous censoring of remaining information cause the majority of Party members to trust everything the Party says, as there is no way to verify anything. As a result, a strong amount of trust is placed in the Party, uniting the population and consequently strengthening their power.1984 is chock-full of satire, mainly of gov’t policies, censorship, and whether or not to monitor citizens. The destitute world that lays in 1984 is a prime reminder of what can happen if the gov’t favors power over morality, security over privacy, correctness over trust. This is the world that our protagonist, the titular common man Winston Smith goes about his daily life. Unlike other protagonists, Smith represents the common, working class man, devoid of any particular traits or skills. As a worker at the Ministry of Truth, Smith is in charge of erasing any information that contradicts the Party’s standpoints, as well as editing. Despite appearing as a dedicated worker, in the confines of his mind, Winston yearns to rebel, constrained by his dismay at possibly being the last free man in Oceania. To his surprise he encounters two coworkers who appear to be rebels, one being a member of the coveted Inner Party. However he flaunts his trust, and soon Winston finds himself staring at the polished barrel of a revolver, wielded by none other than his supposed confidants.Despite the passage of time, 1984 remains a great read for anyone in need of more dystopian literature, yet with a unique setting and unexpected plot. "
126,Ryan S.,"1984 is set in Oceania, where The Party, led by Big Brother, wants everyone unified over one thought:War is Peace.Freedom is Slavery.Ignorance is Strength.Winston Smith, who lives in Airstrip One, does not think that is right, but he can't show it, as the everyone is under heavy surveillance, and he would be arrested for having an independent thought, aka ""thoughtcrime"". He works for the Ministry of Truth, and is in charge of erasing the past, and replacing it with the present, which will then become the past, and will then be replaced with a new present, a continuous cycle. Lies become truth, all to make Big Brother never look wrong. In this world, children denounce their own parents for thoughtcrime, telescreens monitor every word and movement, people are separated by their social standing, and those who know too much/are capable of making Big Brother seem wrong are constantly vaporized, and their existence is erased. Winston's story is 1984. "
127,Faiyal Ahmed,"In some ways i wish he never wrote this book, its just a guide line for any modern dictatorship. But then again its a damn good read."
128,Eric Smith,"I wrote a book report on 1984 my Junior year of high school. I read 1984 for the first time the summer after graduation. Two things about that:1) All Hail Wikipedia!2) A work of fiction that is truly capital-g Great is still great even when you know where it is going.""There is no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects. What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time."" -Kurt VonnegutThe Slaughterhouse-Five quote above obviously applies more to Vonnegut's own time-hopping narratives. And obviously the speculative science fiction of 1984 focuses more on these extremely common narrative attributes that Vonnegut has somehow deemed optional. Despite that the quote, the latter part anyway, rings true. What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments. So, on to 1984 and its Marvelous Moments... A suitably bleak introduction to its far-off-but-closer-than-you'd-hope futuristic world and its quietly fed-up protagonist, Winston Smith.... A character's impassioned musing on his work- the systematic paring down of the dictionary known as newspeak- that is so convincing, I finished the passage almost agreeing that, yeah, maybe it would be nice to have less words to worry about... A hopeful meeting between our protagonist and a high-status, like-minded fellow... A particularly troubling sequence involving rats...The last Four Words.1984 is often praised mostly as a book of ideas. And rightfully so- to a point- as an exploration of nationalism, censorship, betrayal, cognitive dissonance (or lack thereof), and language, it stands tall. To do that, though, is to overlook what I believe truly compels: the doomed love story at the center of all this craziness. The pining, the secret rendezvous, all up to that final exchange- sounding remarkably close to how any normal post-break-up conversation could go- this is what makes 1984 great literature as opposed to a great essay. Following the two important shifts of Winston's love is just about as moving as anything."
129,Lis,"I had read this in high school and, after reading a collection of Orwell's essays, thought I would re-read this now. Clearly his image of the future (from his vantage in 1948) is strongly reflective of both his experiences around the Communist Party (I think never a member but clearly a sympathizer, esp pre-WWII), and of WWII (both the horrors of the Nazis, and life in Britain during the war). He was very pessimistic about the prospects of humanity, as his post-war essays also show.I found the book less interesting than I expected - much of it read like a tract, an exposition of Orwell's view of the near-inevitability of totalitarian government. I think he would have been both amazed and horrified at what has in fact happened since - amazed at the resilience of people who refuse to be ground down, and horrified at some of the dreadful things that humans continue to do to each other (eg Rwanda? Bosnia?). Clearly society and history-as-it-unfolds is more complex than he thought.Nevertheless, this is an important book that had a big impact (and continues to be highly regarded.) I am glad I re-read it."

131,Varun Srivastava,"1984 by George Orwell is the author’s prediction of how he imagined the world if it was ruled euphemistically. The story takes place in London, in a world where you are told that Freedom is Slavery, independent thinking (or ‘thoughtcrime’) is wrong, and where history can be rewritten and redone. The entire society is ruled by ‘The Party’ controlled by the omnipotent ruler ‘Big Brother’. This story was written during the Cold War, and was written almost as a warning to the offenses that the Party committed. The book heavily touches on censorship, where history is completely blocked from the public and completely re-written, to the point where the main character's job is to eliminate all evidence that someone ever existed in history who was mentioned in a newspaper article. The citizens are also always under constant surveillance, monitored by cameras and ‘telescreens’ to monitor aspects of life as small as facial expressions. George Orwell uses the themes of surveillance and censorship to warn us and tell us that there a government and society ruled by deception and fear can not work. I agree with the author’s ideas, and especially appreciate the way in which he wrote the story. George Orwell made the antagonist have arguments and statements so persuasive that I was unsure what to believe at some times. I agree with the author’s concepts of control and how “power entirely for its [your] sake” is bad, and especially thought that his idea that history cannot and should not be deleted is something that is important and people should grasp. My advice to people who may want to read this book is to spend time on each part of the book, and not go into this book expecting it to be a short read. I thought this book was extremely well written and outstandingly thought- provoking."
132,Summer Liang,"I recently finish this book, it was often listed as one of the best book ever written. So when I got my hands on them, I knew I had to read it. However, although I had the books in my possession for a while, only recently I have decided I got all the courage to finish reading it. The book was written with a very suffocating grim outlook and sometimes it could be demeaning to read such unpleasant book in your free time. But it was my time worth and I'm glad I've read it. Nineteen Eighty-Four follows a person, Winston Smith, on his rebellion against his government and his eventual downfall. What really was difficult for me was how grim and how hateful he was against his totalitarian government. It's maddening because it's as if everyone but him remembers the past, one reminisince I share. It's a frustrating and it makes you feel helpless about your circumstances. It's suffocating because there's literally no where you can run. Orwell understood human emotions, particularly human fear, very well. I noticed he did manage to manipulate the reader's emotions and thought as well, just as much of the main character. He wrote it as a foreshadowing of communism and totalitarian. However reading about his back story made me lose respect in him. In his book he warned us about controlling thought and the Thought Police, but in his real life he captures or betrayed people he thought could have ""possibly communistic thoughts"". I'm not sure how true that is, but if that's true then I've have no respect for him at all. Going back to the book, I love the layers and layers of complexity of the book that only came true to me reading until the last sentence of the book. How Smith already was a dying man since the first chapter. I loved it. The character are wonderfully brought to life with complex human emotions and that's rare. Easily one of the best books I've read and I will recommend to anyone who isn' afraid of terrifying alternative reality. "

134,Liz,"Although the reviews for the book vary significantly depending on the aims of the perusing reader, 1984 is a principal read. In my opinion, the author is a keen observer and analyst, a genius perhaps who belong to the few who have the ability to see the tiniest details and use them to recreate a larger picture of reality.But back to the book.For those aiming to be amused by a STORY, I give this THREE stars. The plot is quite simple, but not something to disappointed about. The story merely serves as valves in a complex network where injections of the author's theories and ideas can safely be done without destroying the momentum.For those aiming to be amused by the CHARACTERS, you will have something (many things actually) to think about. While the Party holds an extremely strict view on Sexuality, the main characters are exactly the opposite; they have this awareness and this liberality that imperils them. Also, Orwell has done a great job in describing what it is to be human--the challenges of mortality, pain, hunger, and our intellectual and cognitive capacities and their limitations. The characters grow according to their ambitions and abilities, and they could also be altered through manipulation of their weaknesses. FIVE stars.For those aiming to be amused by CONCEPTS, this book receives another FIVE stars. A few of the many interesting ideas are the following: the association between language and thinking and decision-making (trimming down vocabulary ultimately limits our range of thinking); the need for a unified mind constantly at war in order to preserve the infallibility of a power; the need to manipulate standards to lessen diversity of the members of society; the need to alter history in order to control the present; and importantly, DOUBLETHINK (read the book to understand what this means).Somewhere in the last third of the book comes in the heavy discourse of Goldstein's philosophy (a book reading scene). Anyone who has a weak heart for politics must take a break before diving into the waters. It is not a warning though, for a warning generally implies that there is something dangerous ahead. Far from being perilous or something like an ordeal, Goldstein's book is a very important part, if not the most, in the novel and should not be skipped. It contains the foundation of the plot.So there. I hope this looks like a decent block of gibberish. Sincerely hope you take up and enjoy the book."
135,Joke Adam,"It is a future where everything is old or broken, where scarcity is maintained by the government and where middle class citizens are kept under tight control. Surveillance, mandatory parades, and revisionist history are the keys of the setting. The novel doubles as political manifest, but that doen't diminish its quality as a story."
136,Khaled Al-Sayer,لا أذكر أنني أكملت رواية في يوم من الأيام، لعل الترجمة كانت السبب أو ربما لضعف الحبكة أو ربما لأنني لا أحب الروايات، ولكنني أعلم الآن بعد قراءة رائعة جورج أورويل هذه، أن الترجمة والحبكة وعدم حبي للروايات لم يكن السبب الحقيقي، بل كان بحثي الدائم عن من يستطيع أن يجعلني أن أعيش الأحداث وأن أشتاق إليها كشوق أحدهم إلى الدفء في البرد القارس. لقد استطعت ان تستفزني ياأورويل، فقد قمت بما لم يستطع كل من قرأت له وقذفت روايته إلى غبار الأدراج. على الرغم من علمي الشديد بنفسي أنني ملول جدا ولا أتحمل القراءة في كتاب فترة طويلة، إلا أنك أسرتني في يومين حتى أغلق الغلاف. ولعل المضحك أنني وجدت في أسطورتك المرعبة جاذبية عظيمة، التي بدأت بسببها أشك في جمال ما أراه في عالمي.أخشى الآن أن ما أكتبه قد لا تستحقه، لذلك ألتزم الصمت.
137,Mike Bell,"Jesus fucking Christ...when they said that the American spy-state was ""Orwellian"", I think that may have been a vast understatement. The ""Orwellian"" future that America (and, to a greater extent, the World at large) has come under is rendered as plain as day as I pay attention to news of technological advancements, legislation again them, and the cries of Social Justice Warriors who war against freedom-loving individuals seeking only the thought crimes of self-expression. Say anything that remotely suggests that Zionism is a bad thing and you are labeled an anti-semite. Point out the hypocrisies of feminazism and get labeled as a woman-hating misogynist. There is, clearly, a balance, and 1984 should have been viewed as a warning and NOT as a training manual. Our world is clearly in shambles - wrecked and ruined by those who seek only power. The rules of the game are laid out as plain as day in this wonderful, yet frightening, tale. Many things in my own life seem like a mirror between Winston's travels, his interactions with Julia and with O'Brien. Fortunately, I have not been beaten, and my will still stands triumphant. I am still free, and yet, I am still a slave - we are all still slaves to freedom. "

140,Tara,"Another end-of-the-world book. It's been a while since I've read this one, but I remember liking it. The thing I like about this 'fad' genre is that it causes you to think about the direction our world is going. It causes you to look at current countries regimes and their repressive nature (China) and it causes you to look back into history at those types of governments. When a person gets too much control a lot of bad can happen, even if they believe their intentions are good. That's why our founding fathers created a system of checks and balances to help combat any abuse of power. When power goes unchallenged it can lead to dangerous consequences. I just finished watching the new Captain America movie (the Winter Soldier) and it's another example of how too much power is a bad idea, even if it starts with the best intentions. Come to ink of it, a lot of movies and books are trying to portray this message in different ways. Batman uses everyone's cell phones to find the Joker in Dark Knight Rises, but heroically realsies that no one should have that kind of ability. Anyway, I'm a little off track. 1984 was the book that started it all, and it's been a constant theme in literature and movies as of late. (Hunger Games, Divergent, The Giver, Ender's Game. Etc.)"

142,Anonymousity,"'It was a bright, cold day in April and the clocks were just striking thirteen'From the first sentence, I knew this would be a whopper of a dystopian novel. I read this before most people, only a year after hitting the double-digits. Then I read it again. And again. And again. I read it so much, that by the time I was in high school I could recite most of the novel from memory. This was my first dystopian book after the Giver, and from then on I became hooked on that genre. I read dystopian novel after dystopian novel, but to this day, none compare. Orwell's writing is genius, he has a keen understanding on how the mind works and how people would react to certain events. The plot is unique (at his time), and very suspenseful. The only ""dry"" part of this novel -cut it some slack, every novel has dry parts- is where Orwell inserted an essay as part of the story. The essay is very good, just not what I was expecting. You can easily skip that entire section without hurting your understanding of the novel. 1984 is one of those rare books that can combine science fiction, mystery, suspense, and romance with the artistry of a master painter mixing his oil paints. You feel the hate, the pain, and the wonder of the main character. The Thought Police become your own nightmare. This book makes you fear for the one safe place every human on earth has a right to - their own mind. I have read Dickens, Shakespeare, and Huxley. I have read Mitchell, Collins, and Rowling. But nothing I have read has ever come close to this beautiful, tragic piece of literature. Freedom is Slavery. War is Peace. Ignorance is Strength. Big Brother is watching. "
143,Jonn,"My favourite book of all time. Picked it up one day, couldn't put it down until I was finished. Should be required reading in schools."
144,Jack,"Although it's an allegory for the totalitarian excesses of fascism and Soviet communism (not, as some have argued, a definitive takedown of socialism; it's written by a socialist, dumbass) some of the means of social control depicted by Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four should be somewhat familiar to the 21st century citizen - from the manner in which society is kept on its toes by a constant War on Euras-whoops, sorry, I meant War on Terror, to the uniformity of the ""centrist"" media and political class.In the UK our Trident nuclear defense system is up for renewal. Next time almost everybody with a voice starts screaming ""WE CAN'T POSSIBLY GET RID OF OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS, BECAUSE...LIKE, PUTIN AND STUFF AND, LIKE...ISIS, RIGHT? AMIRIGHT?"" remember the three global superpowers of Nineteen Eighty-Four, stockpiling nukes they never intend to use as a display of dick-waving supremacy.I talk about the politics of the book because Orwell is didactic as hell; this is so much of a polemic posing as a novel it might as well be written by boring-as-fuck ultra-right ideologue Ayn Rand. However, if only Marx had thought of cloaking his rhetoric and analysis in a thrilling web of dystopic intrigue. On the other hand, if Marx had written the Goldstein's Book segment of the narrative it might've been slightly less of a slog. Conclusion: dope as fuck."
145,Kat,"""The Big Brother is watching you..."" No wonder this book is a classic, it is unbelievable how relevant it still is and how accurate those predictions that Orwell made back in 1940's have been and still are today. Winston Smith is an unlikely hero who lives in a futuristic society where ""The Big Brother"" watches your every move and freedom of thought is the highest crime imaginable. In that world love is unorthodox, passion and desire are punishable by death, trust and friendship do not exist, and your own children can turn you in to the thought police for talking in your sleep. Winston takes a step towards a slippery path by beginning an affair with a young and beautiful coworker Julia, a thing unimaginable in the new world. But it is only a matter of time before they have to face the consequences of committing a crime of independent thought. The world of 1984 as extreme as it is is after all is not that far fetched from the one we live in. "

148,Lani Prunés,"Oligarchy. I'm seeing it everywhere now, and reconsidering the ways our government functions. "
149,Lyndsey,"YOU. ARE. THE. DEAD. Oh my God. I got the chills so many times toward the end of this book. It completely blew my mind. It managed to surpass my high expectations AND be nothing at all like I expected. Or in Newspeak ""Double Plus Good.""Let me preface this with an apology. If I sound stunningly inarticulate at times in this review, I can't help it. My mind is completely fried.This book is like the dystopian Lord of the Rings, with its richly developed culture and economics, not to mention a fully developed language called Newspeak, or rather more of the anti-language, whose purpose is to limit speech and understanding instead of to enhance and expand it. The world-building is so fully fleshed out and spine-tinglingly terrifying that it's almost as if George travelled to such a place, escaped from it, and then just wrote it all down.I read Fahrenheit 451 over ten years ago in my early teens. At the time, I remember really wanting to read 1984, although I never managed to get my hands on it. I'm almost glad I didn't. Though I would not have admitted it at the time, it would have gone over my head. Or at the very least, I wouldn't have been able to appreciate it fully.From the start, the author manages to articulate so many of the things I have thought about but have never been able to find a way to put into words. Even in the first few chapters I found myself having to stop just to quietly consider the words of Mr Orwell.For instance, he talks about how the act of writing itself is a type of time travel. It is communicating with the future. I write these words now, but others may not discover them for hours, weeks, or even years. For me, it is one time. For you the reader, it is an entirely different one.Just the thought that reading and writing could one day be outlawed just shivers my timbers. I related to Winston so much in that way. I would have found a way to read or write.The politics and psychology of this novel run deep. The society in the book has no written laws, but many acts are punishable by death. The slogan of the Party (War is Peace...) is entirely convoluted. Individuality is frowned upon and could lead to being labeled a traitor to the Party.I also remember always wondering why the title was 1984. I was familiar with the concept of Big Brother and wondered why that wasn't the name of the book. In the story, they don't actually know what year it is because so much of the past has been erased by the Ministry of Truth. It could very easily have been 1981. I think that makes the title more powerful. Something as simple as the year or date is unknown to these people. They have to believe it is whatever day that they are told it is. They don't have the right to keep track. Knowledge is powerful. Knowledge is necessary. But according to Big Brother. Ignorance is strength.1984 is written in past tense and has long paragraphs of exposition, recounting events, and explaining the society. These are usually things that distance me from a book and from the characters, but Orwell managed to keep me fully enthralled. He frequently talks in circles and ideas are often repeated but it is still intriguing, none the less. I must admit that I zoned out a bit while Winston was reading from The Book, but I was very fascinated by the culture.Sometimes it seems as though the only way to really experience a characters emotions is through first person. This is not the case with this book, as it is written in third person; yet, I never failed to be encompassed in Winston's feelings. George manages to ensure that the reader never feels disconnected from the events that are unfolding around them, with the exception of the beginning when Winston is just starting to become awakened. I developed a strong attachment to Winston and thrived on living inside his mind. I became a member of the Thought Police, hearing everything, feeling everything and last but not least, (what the Thought Police are not allowed to do) questioning everything.I wasn't expecting a love story in this book, but the relationship between Julia and Winston was truly profound. I enjoyed it even more than I would have expected and thought the moments between them were beautiful. I wasn't sure whether he was going to eventually betray Julia to the Party or not, but I certainly teared up often when it came to their relationship.George has an uncanny ability to get to the base of the human psyche, at times suggesting that we need to be at war for many different reasons, whether it's at war with ourselves or with others. That is one thing I have never understood: why humans feel the need to destroy and control each other.It seems that the main and recurring message in this book is about censorship and brainwashing. One, censorship, is limited and little exposure to ideas of the world; the other, brainwashing, is forced and too much exposure to a certain ideas. Both can be extremely dangerous.Inside the ministry of Truth, he demonstrates the dangers of censorship by showing how the Party has completely rewritten the past by forging and abolishing documents and physical evidence. We also spend quite a bit of time with Winston in the Ministry of Love, where the brainwashing takes place. Those who commit thoughtcrime are tortured until they grow to love and obey Big Brother and serve only the interests of the Party.A common theme occurred to me throughout the book, although it wasn't necessarily referenced consistently. The good of the many is more important than the good of the one. There are so many variables when it comes to this statement and for the most part it seems natural to say, ""Of course, the many is more important than the one"", but when inside Winston's head, all that I began to care about was his well-being and not if he was able to help disband or conquer the Party and Big Brother. I just wanted him to be at peace. Whether or not the good of all is more important than that of the one, I can't answer. I think most people feel their own happiness is more important than the rest of the world's, and maybe that's part of the problem but it's also human nature. I only wish we could all accept one other regardless of belief and culture and not try to force ways of life onto other people. Maybe I'm naive for thinking that way, but so be it.I almost don't know what to think about this book. I'm not even sure my brain still works, or if it ever worked right at all. This book has a way of making you think you know exactly what you believe about everything and then turning you completely upside down and making you question whether or not you believe anything at all about anything. It's the strangest thing. Hmmm. Doublethink? Perhaps. Perhaps not.Everything about this book is captivating. It's groundbreaking yet at the same time, purely classic. Ahead of its time, yet timeless. From Big Brother to the Thought Police, I was hooked and wanted to know more about it all.Basically, I think everyone should read 1984 at some point. You really have to be in the mood to work at reading it, though. But it's all worth it in the end. It's absolutely incredible and I loved it. I don't re-read many books but this will definitely be one of them. It is a hard read, but more importantly, it is a MUST read."

151,L.,"Through out the centuries, men have preached altuism and unity. They were Big Brother. Through out the centuries, men have preached equality and hypocrisy. They were Big Brother. Through out the centuries, men have preached non-thought and conformity. They were Big Brother. Through out history, a long line of men have stood, begining with Plato, continuing with Stalin, and propagated today by every man, woman, and child who believes that 2+2=5, that A is not A.These men have stood for Big Brother, have stood for Ingsoc, have stood for evil, and have stood for 1984. George Orwell's masterpiece stood for all that which conflicted with those ideals: for love, for happiness, for individualism, for ego. On the surface, Orwell paints a picture more sickening, and more chilling to any person who believes that they are, that they are not a group, not a consortium, but exist in and for their own right.This is not a Utopia; this is what could happen, not what has happened. It is a testament to those who will not take the easy way out, will not conform. It is instead a tribute to those who rage against the dying of the light, for those who think, and those who know that 1984 can be stopped, by those who have stopped it through out the centuries: those who will not sanctify the punishment of virtue. The hero of this book is not Winston; it is the old prole' hanging out laundry, and making the song written by a machine a thing of beauty. In the end, the proletariat must rise; for they are not the lowest class, but the highest. The party members consider themselves higher because they have force, and therefor, by their reckoning, power. But they do not; they have nothing; everything is the Party's. But they are not the party; Big Brother is the Party. In the end, the Prole's are the powerful ones, for they know the beauty of reality, and of the of the simple phrase, ""It is mine."""
152,Faez,"The relevance of this book is amazing. It goes much beyond the intentions of Orwell himself. Every time I read it I discover something new. The insights and the relevance keep me tied up to this masterpiece. This time it occurred to me for example, while I was reading the terms O'Brien dictates to Smith, that injustice and dictatorship prepare people to accept the utmost desperate measures in their resistance. One astonishing prediction in the novel is the invention of the versificator to compose songs. Isn't this what certain computer programs are doing nowadays for some modern composers?? A lot is there, but the best advice to give is reread this amazing book, it renews itself continuously."

159,Hattie,"Orwell is a genius, the more I read of his the more I admire him. I'll admit I know barely anything about politics, but Orwell really manages to get me interested. I really don't know where to start with this review, because this is one of those books you could talk about forever, so I'll just pick out a few of the bits that stood out for me.- Lets start with the ending - Even though Julia and Winston's relationship was completely dysfunctional (Basically, Julia only cared about her own freedom, whereas Winston looked towards the future generations) it still kind of worked. What made the end of their relationship even more heartbreaking was that they chose not to be together - there was no feeling left - which made it even worse than the party keeping them apart.- Even though Orwell's novels are almost overwhelmingly political, which can deduct from the story, I feel he is also a brilliant storyteller and I really liked his style. This is where my criticism comes in - I'd love more character development. Also, because it was so political, there were some small parts I found tedious, for example the extract from Goldstein's book (did it really need to be so long??) and the concept of newspeak.- A nice touch in the novel was the foreshadowing of the telescreen in Winston and Julia's hideaway. Julia mentions cleaning behind the photo frame but never gets round to it, which is a forgettable and seemingly unimportant part of the book. Later on, you find out there's a telescreen behind it. I don't really know why this is relevent. I just liked it.- Doublethink was such a great concept. It allows for the perfect totalitarian state, which alludes to Orwell's genius once more.- Finally, I love how manipulated I felt by this book. I started off so sure that the party was despicable and immoral. However, by the end I was left questioning whether the party was actually in the wrong or whether Winston was. I also felt increasingly depressed throughout the novel - which was lovely as it reflected how inescapable the party was, and how hopeless the people of the state were."

162,Joana Gonçalves,"Após passar a noite a pensar no que li e a processar a informação destas 355 páginas, tenho apenas uma coisa a dizer-vos: uau.""1984"" fala-nos de uma sociedade distópica imaginada por George Orwell que nos ""absorve"" de uma maneira aterradora. Winston vive num mundo que é controlado por uma identidade desconhecida, o Big Brother. Para onde quer que olhe, o ser humano depara-se constantemente com cartazes onde uma figura ""de uma beleza austera"", cujos olhos pareciam seguir tudo e todos.Este é um mundo diferente do nosso. Mas será assim tão diferente?Os habitantes da Oceânia estavam constantemente a ser bombardeados com informação extremamente positiva pelo Partido. Este dizia o que as pessoas queriam ouvir, sabendo que o mundo não era assim tão cor-de-rosa. Esta identidade procurava construir um mundo em que toda a gente pudesse ser controlada, manipulada, forçada a acreditar em determinados paradigmas sem perguntar ""como"" e ""porquê"".Quem não obedecesse a esta forma de pensar, sabia que a sua existência seria apagada numa questão de tempo. Tortura, confissão, morte. Era esse o processo de ""purificação"" do espírito que o Partido procurava.O que mais me chocou foram as formas de manipulação... A criação da ""Novilíngua"", língua oficial cujo principal objetivo era tornar impossíveis todas as formas de pensamento, eliminar qualquer pensamento herético que divergisse dos princípios do Partido. O vocabulário era pensado de modo a exprimir com exatidão o que se queria dizer, eliminando a expressão de emoções e sentimentos e vocabulário que pudesse ser dotado de um sentido diferente do pretendido.A friezas das imagens transmitidas à população, o ""fabrico"" de crianças capazes de denunciar os próprios pais, o casamento que se cingia à procriação de filhos para o serviço do partido, sendo também o ato sexual visto como algo meramente desprovido de prazer e algo repugnante......Toda esta lavagem cerebral deixou em mim algum impacto. Impossível ficar indiferente se começarmos a questionar o mundo em que vivemos. Aliás, esta obra retrata, embora de maneira um pouco diferente, alguns acontecimentos do passado.Não sei que dizer mais.

164,Μιτς Γιωτίξ,"One of the most famous books describing a""future"" dystopia, 1984 was written to show Orwell's fear of a totalitarian state. It has the same vein of ideas and thoughts as ""Brave New World"" (although that society is conserved via other means) and Farenheit 451 (which I have to re-read at some point).The book is somewhat pessimistic, although I prefer this a thousand times over a silly happy ending. Even so, this is the kind of book I suggest to everybody due to its political importance."

167,Ângelo,"Winston Smith vive num mundo dividido em três nações (Oceânia, Eurásia & Lestásia) que se equilibram mutuamente mantendo assim uma sustentabilidade com um suporte, muito básico, o suporte bélico. A acção decorre em Londres capital da Oceânia que alterna o estado de agressão vs. pacificação entre as outras nações, ora vive em guerra com a Eurásia e confraternar pacificamente com Lestásia como de um momento para o outro a situação se inverte. Oceânia é controlada pelo Grande Irmão que tu vê e ouve através dos telecras bidireccionais. O grande Irmão está a implementar uma nova língua a novilíngua, como objectivo fundear uma nova linguagem, linguagem onde se retirará tudo o é passível de ser pensado uma linguagem simples e básica, removendo do cidadão a aptidão do pensamento, pois nem isso constará como parte da novilíngua, este, o grande irmão, alimenta o ódio para com os seus inimigos, num sistema de propaganda imenso.. Winston trabalha no ministério da verdade ou MiniVer o ministério que se ocupa das notícias, entretenimento, educação e as artes plásticas. Compete-lhe basicamente reescrever as notícias enviando as notícias antigas para o lixo. Winston, e não só, faz com as noticias o que o partido faz com ele, elimina vestígios do passado reescrevendo o futuro na medida que lhes convêm. Nesta sinecura, Winston, que está no centro da pirâmide socialmente estruturada, começa a ter pensamentos e acções de revolta para com o sistema funcional da Oceânia, começa a escrever para O’Brien um “conhecido” de Winston, onde um só olhar fez acreditar no íntimo de Wisnton que O’Brien o compreendia, o medo contrasta com a esperança nos proles, classe social que na imaginação de Winston se revoltará contra o poder totalitarista do Grande Irmão. Mas num determinado momento, Júlia mulher que Winston repudia por pertencer e apoiar fervorosamente o Grande Irmão irá alterar a vida de Winston de forma irreparável ao entregar-lhe um pedaço de papel contendo a palavra... “Amo-te”. Oceânia tem como objectivo fundear uma nova linguagem, linguagem onde se retirará tudo o é passível de ser pensado uma linguagem simples e básica, removendo do cidadão a aptidão do pensamento, pois nem isso constará como parte da novilíngua. ""No seu conjunto, o mundo está hoje num ponto mais primitivo do que à cinquenta anos."" ""A longo prazo, a organização hierárquica da sociedade só seria viável assentando de novo na pobreza e na ignorância."" ""Sem padrões de comparação as massas não se revoltam, pois não sabem se são oprimidas."" ""A mutabilidade do passado é o dogma central da Socing."" Este tipo de pensamentos recheiam o livro que coloca o leitor num constante rodopio sensorial e emocional, Orwell conseguiu arquitectar uma obra magistral intemporal. Este é um livro que nos faz pensar na estrutura social, um livro que nos leva ao essencial que nos leva ao nosso “quarto 101” (quem leu compreenderá quem não leu aqui tem um bom motivo para ler este livro), este livro é uma porta para o mais básico de cada um de nós, mas escrito sempre numa relação de entendimento de afecto, uma espécie de síndrome de Estocolmo, quase poética mas de uma crueldade infinitamente avassaladora. Um livro com uma linguagem extremamente simples, desde que inicialmente se interiorize os conceitos da novilíngua, mas com uma aspereza de sentimentos, aqueles sentimentos nus que fazem tremer os nossos alicerces, no final fechei o livro e... apeteceu-me reler o livro. Recomendado."

174,Dridge,"Usually, classics are hardly ever suspenseful for me. (Except maybe for the final parts of „Bleak House“ and „A Tale of Two Cities“.) But this one grabbed me right by the ankles, I really coudln’t put it down, read it in a tremendous speed and finished it in two days. It is truly a masterpiece: Whenever you think „Oh boy, this idea is untopable“, there comes an even better thing around.The only negative aspect about this book isn’t itself, but its fans: People who constantly feel the urge to tell you how much alike our world is to 1984, only because we have facebook and twitter. Duh. This book isn’t at all about that, it’s about totalitarian regimes! Just shut up and read this magnificently crafted, intelligently designed and wonderfully written novel.(Pro Tip: I suggest reading Orwell’s „Animal Farm“ first, which gives a great insight into how totalitarian regimes are formed and use to appear almost out of nowhere. Let it sit for a while and then head on to 1984.)"
175,Jacob Davies,"I thoroughly enjoyed 1984. The book focuses on the life of Winston Smith, a cog in a well oiled dystopia machine. It is set in a future (1984) ruled by “the Party”, a political party that has firm control of everything within its borders from information to actions, focused more so on the former, and offers both theories and warnings about power within society that are eerily relevant today. In a society of uniformity and lacking autonomy where one is under constant surveillance and one social misstep can leave one vaporized from ever bring, Winston is a heretic, keeping an anti-government diary of his thoughts and beliefs as well as acting on primal urges that would lead to his demise. Winston’s life is mundane, exactly as the Party and Big Brother would like, however his thoughts are not. Winston works for the Ministry of Truth where he manipulates the media and reconstructs the past to match the future in an effort to continue the illusion that the Party is infallible. Although those around him are able to accept the constant changing of what is true despite being told the opposite moments earlier, Winston cannot seem to forget the things that he knows as true. He finds a love interest outside of his failed marriage in Julia, a much younger woman who too enjoys subverting the power of the Party, albeit in a manner that is much more superficial than Winston’s deep seeded internal rebellion. The two find inevitably find themselves in the hands of the Party and learn what it is that true Power is. The book serves as a reminder of how absolute power can manifest itself in government. It is a warning. The story references other failed attempts of governments, from Nazi Germany to Monarchies of past, and how their uses of powers failed where the Party has not and will not. 1984 delves into the communal psyche that needs to be cultivated in order to obtain this power and does so wonderfully!The narrative of 1984 is its genius. Perhaps it in the historical references that give the reader a chance to relate to the story or how Orwell is able to make such a seemingly outlandish society seem unnerving plausible. He is able to achieve this ability to relate by carefully detailing how power has worked in both a historical and contemporary framework. He delves into the psychology of society and the castes within in a manner that is simplistic and obvious. This is the strongest aspect of the writing, the characters within this frames work lack. Other than Winston, through flashbacks to his childhood, the other characters in the book are not very well developed but at the same time, for the purpose of the novel, it is unnecessary to do so. Since the story is about a time in which individuality and free thought is penalized in the harshest way possible, the reader does not get to know the characters intimately. Instead the reader embarks on an engrossing narrative that is as relevant today as it was over 60 years ago when Orwell wrote it. "
176,Charles S,"1984 is a book about a person who wants to rebel against the Utopian government. An official argues with him and convinces him that the government was actually good. I think that this is a book with a deeper meaning. (view spoiler)[I think this because it really puts forth a message about how a government can surpress the people to the point where anyone who disagrees with it will either be killed or beaten and questioned until they start contradicting themselves and do not want to rebel anymore. One example of this is Withers. He loves Julia and hates Big Brother. After the beatings and the questionings he is starting to lie to himself (in Newspeak this is called doublethink). At one point they put him in a room full of rats (his least favorite thing in the world) and he tells them to do it to Julia, not him. This shows how a person changes into something else in the eyes of fear and will do anything. Something that I found very interesting was the concept of Newspeak. Newspeak is the language spoken in Oceana. Oceana is a super-country comprised of the British Isles and the Americas. Newspeak is very similar to English, in fact, English is what Newspeak is based off of. In Newspeak one does not say good, bad, excellent, or terrible, they would say good, ungood, plusgood, and plusungood. In this way the vocabulary was reduced and this even made the people think in a more straightforward manner. In short, eventually nobody would be able to understand the concept of rebellion. (hide spoiler)]I think that 1984 is a very interesting book because it was written at a time where the year 1984 was in the distant future. We are now far past 1984, and the world is still not so bad as it is in 1984 (the story). However, some parts of the book have come true, at least to an extent. For instance, the government (Big Brother) is not always watching us, Corporate America is. It is sort of scary to think that companies like Microsoft, Google, or Apple can basically monitor our whole lives. Enough of that, back to the book. 1984 could be considered just another Utopian novel, but this one is different. Some of the main points that make it different that I would like to highlight are that it focuses on two main characters, it has a set date, and it is far more ominous and pessimistic about the future (well, it is now in the past)First, the focus on just two characters. This is a very special aspect of 1984 because it lets you really look in to the lives of the average person in the story. It is written in first person which allows you to see the thoughts of on particular character. This allows you to learn what the people in this strange society are thinking, and gives you a greater understanding of the book. Also, because there is such an intent focus on so few characters, it almost forces you to feel sympathetic towards them. Feeling sympathetic for a character in a book is strange, you know it is not real, but yet you find yourself thinking about what you would do to help the characters if it was real. Also, having these feelings for characters in a book makes you not want to put the book down, and this is just one of the very many aspects that make up a good book.Now for a little rant about the significance of having a set date on when a Utopian book (or any futuristic book, for that matter) is supposed to be set. Having a date allows people to think ""Oh, that is only x years away from now."" if the date has yet to become a date referred to as the present, or, ""I remember that year x y and z compare so well. That is amazing that the author could predict the future so well."" This also makes the book seem extremely real, another aspect of the theoretical ""good book""We now come to a part of the utmost importance, the concept that in my opinion makes George Orwell such a special author. Enough with the delays and lead-ins! The fact is that this book (and author, I might add) is that they are so ominous and pessimistic about things. 1984 is probably the sad book regarding the future that I have ever read. For instance, it deals with the idea that the human race will lie to itself, change documents, and totally (wrongly, I might add) change the record of the past. We (humanity) have already started doing that, in a way. If we do not know something, we make something up that seems to make sense, and then promptly accept it as true.I do not think that Orwell was trying to predict the future, rather, I think that he was trying to offer up a worst-possible-scenario for the future. In my opinion, I think that his motive for this was that he wanted people to think that this is what the world was coming to (which it was, this was just a major exaggeration) and try to shape themselves up. Nobody knows if this book made a difference in the course of history, but I will try to present you with the facts in the most straightforward way that I know how. 1984 was (and still is) a book that was read by a large slew of people. This means that the idea was spread around, and those who had not read it had heard a little (or a lot) about the plot-line and the basic themes of the story. This book shot a scare through most of the people who read it or heard about it. This could be taken as the fact that some people thought that Orwell was a prophet, and was predicting the future. This book was taken seriously by a very large group of people, and caused them to take action. We will never know if 1984 changed the world, but it is definitely worth thinking about, and, if it did change anything, it could not have been for the worse."

179,terrycojones,"There's no need for me to add a review of this wonderful book. I read it in high school and then re-read it in 2003 or so, enjoying it even more. It's beautifully done.The thing I do want to mention is what was going on in Orwell's life at the time he was trying to get the book out. It's well worth reading Orwell's essays, letters, etc. (there's a Penguin edition in 4 volumes). Orwell was an amazing man - I love his personal integrity, that he so often works from first principles, his universal curiosity, his insight, his frankness, and of course his prose. I wrote a little about the conditions under which he finished 1984 here:http://www.fluidinfo.com/terry/2008/0...If you like Orwell's writing but don't know much about Orwell the man, go read the essays. They're not only brilliant, you'll learn a lot about this wonderful character. The world needs more Orwells."

182,Ancient,"Rated 5 stars for being an excellently written, terrifying, insightful about modern governments, and a personal favorite read.I think 1984 should be required reading for everyone living in the modern world. Not just because it's a great piece of fiction (which I think it is), but because it describes the aims and methods of totalitarian governments so well. 1984 is one of the most terrifying books I have ever read. It prophecies present and future dystopia where the sophisticated machinations of an almighty state have crushed and enslaved the individual with no hope of release. The current U.S. government, with it's increased infotainment, doublespeak, secrecy, stripping away of rights and freedoms, prison camps, use of war and terror to enforce obedience and control of the populace, etc. lurches us just that much closer to something out of this book.

186,Katherine Yepes,"¿Qué puedo decir que le haga justicia a este libro?Orwell fue un genio, un visionario, un maestro de la distopía, la cual se ha convertido en ,mi género favorito. Amo todo de este libro, en especial su final, el cual me dejó atónita y en un estado de estupor.Orwell se centra totalmente en describir este sistema totalitario y ese detalle fue el que me enamoró de la historia, porque pienso que es un aspecto del que carecen la mayoría de distopías actuales, siempre me dejan preguntas y vacíos del universo en el que se desarrollan, en este caso no, el autor hace un excelente trabajo de creación de universo ficcional.Es mi distopía favorita por mucho, los autores contemporáneos deberían seguir más su ejemplo en vez de malgastar universos maravillosos desarrollando historias de amor más que forzadas."
187,Ariane Nazemi,"1984 Always had me hooked. From the beginning to the end, the book was interesting and thoughtful. When Orwell introduced the telescreens, it truly alarmed me that someone from 1949 could have predicted flat-screen monitors at a time when television technology was in its infancy. The same goes for the entire book, how could someone from an older time have predicted some if the moral complexities of today's society. Overall, the book was one that I am very glad to have read, it opened my mind to the extreme possibilities of political ideas and it exposed me to the harshest form of reason, illogical reason. This may seem as a contradiction, but that is what the book strived to portray, the act of ""doublethink"", which is actually used today, even if we don't know it, is the ability to be ignorant at the same time of being conscious. This theme is displayed throughout the book many times as : WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. I feel that the book's conclusion was morbid, profound, and perfect. For it utterly moved me while staying true to the underlying theme of the book. This entire novel is also a political exercise in the ""Allegory of the Cave"" scenario. Before I spoil anything major I would just like to say that I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone."

190,Σουρτούκω,"Το δυστοπικό 1984 μπορεί να μην είναι το πιο προφητικό βιβλίο του κόσμου. Μπορεί ο Οργουελικός Μεγάλος Αδερφός να δείχνει κάπως παρωχημένος στην εποχή που η αλήθεια δεν κρύβεται αλλά χάνεται σε έναν ωκεανό άχρηστων πληροφοριών (όπως επισήμανε ο Πόστμαν στη σύγκριση του 1984 με το Brave New World). Ωστόσο δε θα μπορούσαμε να μιλάμε για πολιτικό προβληματισμό, δε θα μπορούσαμε να μιλάμε για διαστρέβλωση της πραγματικότητας, δε θα μπορούσαμε να μιλάμε για δυστοπία, δε θα μπορούσαμε να μιλάμε ούτε για αγάπη που νικάει τα πάντα χωρίς να μιλήσουμε για το 1984. Είναι ξεκάθαρα ένα ορόσημο της παγκόσμιας λογοτεχνίας."
191,Natasha Primaditta,"Doubleplusgood! I remember finished with reading 1Q84 couple of months ago and then wanting to read 1984 from the many references of it within. I imagined a perfect utopian country brimming with wars and other misconducts, to found out when I was reading 1984, it turns out to be right! What's fascinating from this book were how authentic and intricately crafted the whole universe of Oceania. From the founding principles of INGSOC to insane social paranoia as the outcome, it was a great book of a disturbing alternate future of our world, where totalitarian were in charge. I for once feeling so grateful that I had the freedom to do what I want to do, think what I want to do, and do it as like; for instance, writing this superfluous review. Truly, I cannot imagine how to live in a world where freedom is the same as a slavery. Another thing to point out is how rich and intelligible the essay-like part within this book that explains more about the principle of INGSOC. I gotta say, that part blew me away. It explains why the three dogmas, WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, and IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH make sense in a distorted logics and able to preserve Oceania as a country while controlling its citizens to quench their will and thought for revolution. All went back to systematic brainwashing from earlier age to create a paranoid, obedient, and robot like society for the ruling classes and where the lower class, the proles, were treated the same as animals. The party can actually do everything as they perceived necessary:“In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right. For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable—what then?” The theme, I must say it was sort of depressing, but nonetheless, brilliantly written. From the opening act where I get to know the illustrious life in one of Oceania's city and the mind of Winston Smith, the protagonist to the second part, which I really like, is where Orwell delve further into his ideas of war, politics, economy, and social structures. Then the finally the third part, where Orwell questions their effect on society in general and a person conduct specifically. All parts flows ceaselessly and smoothly, while the story still relevant.Reading 1984 is like a trip into slowly sucking quicksand of negative madness, yet brilliant from the top to the final word. "
192,Carpe Diem,"This book will probably haunt me forever, one thing I know for sure is my life would never be the same after reading it."
193,Sixto Ortiz,"Simplemente espectacular. Me tomó un tiempo en terminar este libro ya que no es un libro tan agradable de leer. Ningún libro me había hecho sentir tanta ansiedad, nerviosismo y terror a la misma vez. Primero que todo la prosa de Orwell es excelente me encanta como escribe este señor, era una prosa tan detallada, que transmitía emociones de cierta manera. Los conceptos envueltos en en esta novela son sinceramente aterradores; pero, con un reflejo de nuestra sociedad actualmente. Y es ahí donde pienso que está obra es espectacular; como Orwell hace 66 años atrás pudo predecir las filosofías políticas que se estaría implantando en un futuro y peor aún como se puede manipular la verdad y hacernos creer que dicha mentiras fueron siempre veraz conocido en la novela como el ''doublethink''. Orwell, nos demuestra lo complicado que es el ''ser humano'' en esencia, pero, de igual manera lo fácil que es de engañar. Hace un predicción sobre como seríamos engañados y peor aún demostrando el poco interés que le prestamos a tales violaciones. Un libro altamente recomendado para todo el mundo, quizás, no es aquel libro de verano que se puede leer un día soleado en playa pero es uno que toda persona debe leer. "

195,Evan," ""1984"" by George Orwell is a story about a society where the government controls all. The protagonist of the book is a man named Winston. Right away, you can tell that there is something different about Winston, almost suspicious even. I could easily notice his fearful yet determined attitude right from the beginning. This immediately drew me into the book because I wanted to know what he seemed to be so afraid of and what was making him so determined in his actions. In the society where he lived, called Oceania, the government is everywhere and controlling everything. It is revealed right away that there seems to be no privacy for the citizens whatsoever. There are monitors in the houses that could be watching and listening to your conversations at any time. You find out there are spies for the government walking the streets. Finally, what really tips the scales as for making it obvious of the government's constant presence is the fact that there are posters absolutely everywhere of the leader, known as Big Brother. In the government, there are four departments. There is the Ministry of Peace, Ministry of Plenty, Ministry of Love, and Ministry of Truth. Winston works for the Ministry of Truth, which is basically the propaganda canter of the government. The government is simply known as, The Party. In the book it shows Winston becoming increasingly more and more frustrated with the control The Party has over everything. The Party has so much power and is so corrupt that even to think about defying it is illegal. In fact, event to think as an individual is illegal. If you are caught doing this, you are taken by the thoughtpolice. As the book goes on, Winston meets a woman named Julia and they fall in love. They act more and more as individuals and free thinkers throughout the book. They defy The Party in almost every way they can to continue their love for one another. Finally, they are caught by The Party and taken to the Ministry of Love for punishment.  I found this book so interesting because it focuses on the idea of how much control a government should be allowed to gain over its people. Throughout the book I also found many connections to Stalin's rule in the Soviet Union. I found it to be trying to show how evil his government actually was by creating a fictional story. Something I really enjoyed about the book was how it used irony to prove many of its points. For example, in the book, The Party's main philosophy is ""War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength."" I found this so interesting because in this philosophy it is taking what we consider to be some of the worst things we have in our own society and saying they are equal to what we feel are some of the greatest things in society. The philosophy is a complete contradiction of itself and is a great representation of the propaganda that The Party uses throughout the book. Winston is shown as one of the few people who sees through all of this propaganda. He sees that The Party is corrupt and evil to its own people. In the book, his love for Julia represents his will to defy the government. Julia gives him a reason to fully realize how much The Party is depriving him of in his life. Through its complete control, The Party deprives its citizens of love, privacy, independence, individuality, and even freedom of one's own mind and thoughts.  When Winston and Julia are caught and taken to the Ministry of Love, you see the true and most evil part of The Party. The Ministry of Love is where the government sends people that it considers to be ""rebels"". In this place, Winston is tortured and scarred for months. They try to teach him to love The Party and basically give up any hope of a better life. This shows that The Party is so powerful that it almost has the power of mind control. A great quote to show this is "" In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it."" This quote is saying that no matter how hard you try to defy it, no matter how much you strive for a better life, you must accept the fact that The Party is in control, and even if you know it is wrong, you must believe it to be right. After reading this I was able to draw a connection to real life and our emotions. Sometimes, even though we know that we are right, if everyone else tells us we are wrong, we start to believe it too because we feel like it is hopeless to argue.  Though I will not reveal the ending of the book, I will say that the idea of government is supposed to be to protect its people. Yet in the book, in the Ministry of Love, The Party forces Winston to face his greatest fears to try to force him to succumb to their will. This book shows just how dangerous and corrupt a government can really become. a real life example, as said before, was Stalin in the Soviet Union. ""1984"" drew heavily from that government. Orwell's ability to show us just how important our own individuality is to keeping us safe is amazing and is what made me find the book so interesting. He was able to show that are greatest tools, our greatest weapons, are our very own thoughts. With freedom of thought comes freedom of forming ideas and opinions, and with that comes the will to stand up for those opinions and beliefs, and that is the greatest power in the world. This is why The Party made sure to even try to control the mind of the individual. it is because they knew that if they did not, then they would never be able to hold power. For a short time, Winston and the woman he loved, Julia, were able to truly experience this and all of the wonders and revelations that came with it.  The ending of the book had a deep impact on me. Though you will have to read it to find out, the concept is that the freedom of mind and love is a gift. If you break that gift by succumbing to the will of another, than there is no turning back, for you have forever betrayed yourself and your own opinions. This idea had a deep and moving impact on me because it showed me how important it is that I stand by my beliefs and values and never betray them. I found the entire book extremely moving and not only would I recommend that others read it, I think that it is important that others reading it. This book shows the true value of your own mind, no matter what thoughts it may hold, this book showed me that every one of them is unique to you and by standing by them it makes you forever special and powerful in your own life. "
196,Suleiman Arabiat,"A scary and magnificent novel. With these words one can summarize this piece of anti-totalitarian literature.The book follows the ultimate point of an outer-party member's life, where he reaches towards full consciousness about the party, Big Brother, the society, and reality itself, and wishes to change it towards an unknown better.The book is scary, even terrifying, since each of the proposed ideas on how to control people are already somehow in motion or were already tried and failed by regimes that came after Orwell died.The idea of changing language to control thoughts is ingenious, and is actually being implemented these days to wide areas of the world (whether intentionally or just as a by-product of globalization, either way it's happening).The book delves deep into why would anyone want such power, and answers it sufficiently. It also delves very deep into the metaphysical question of: what is reality, and does just exist in the individual's mind, or in the collective consciousness of humans, and thus can it be controlled if consciousness is controlled? A very big question, which the author discusses through the characters and events.A highly recommended read."
197,Helen,"This should be required reading in schools! Recommended reading for anyone, though admittedly you will be looking over your shoulder for some time and noticing CCTV much more often!"
198,Kandice,"I just re-read this because my son is reading it for school. It's always been one of my favorite books, and I was taken aback by his feeling it was so far-fetched. I guess because he's young, he has that sense of invincibility. HIS generation would never let such an oppressive party rule THEM! Perish the thought! As a voting adult, it seems very plausible to me, and I can easily see the path taken to get to such dire straits. The false threats used to instill false fear, and force the public to choose the lesser of two evils...much like V for Vendetta, the whole process feels uncomfortably possible, even timely, in my opinion.Winston is not a hero we can fall in love with. He's not a man we can admire, or even really root for. Of course I've read this many times, but I think it's safe to say, even upon my first reading, I knew he was doomed. The intricate system the government uses to find, punish and then convert ""bad thinkers"" is chilling, and essentially, fail proof. They always win. The dissenter always loses. It's a forgone conclusion.The fact that they take so much time, extend so many resources and expense to convert Winston, just to have him admit his mistake...that is the scariest part to me. They don't even require a public admission, he needs only admit the error of his ways to himself (and them, of course). The whole process serves no purpose except to show themselves they can do it. Winston doesn't matter. His beliefs don't matter. Only his disobedience does."
199,Mayur Ramteke,"it is one of those novel u ought to read before u die if u are zealot about reading......1984 is written in late forties by George Orwell about 20th century, in future how oligarchy is practiced and prole, common people don't have freedom to express their ideas.I personally feel that he actually forecast the future in his novel with vivid imagination. in novel 3 superstates are on the edge of war, BIG BROTHER is constantly watching everyone, spying every member, they have to perform celibacy. Party member don't even have freedom to say 2 and 2 makes 4, they live in servitude, wield by Party! and if u compare our present scenario every being is constantly marching towards destruction, people living in solitude, media is feeding lie and we continuously devouring it, recent reveal of NSA espionage what to say more! every one become a warmonger!"
200,Joshua,"1984 was a thought provoking book about Winston, a non involved member of the ""Party."" It follows his realization of the destructive society that he lives in, a society created in pre-war England, now known as Oceania. He begins to realize the faults in this society and as time goes on, he attempts to join the rebellion, all the while being carefully monitored by the government. This story shows how he attempts to rise through a few means and explains what he believes about this society by writing a diary, an idea that is frowned upon in his society.  I loved this book a lot! At first, i felt like it was a good introduction but with too much exposition. After a while, i got used to the book style and how it focuses more on the big picture rather than the small scale of the characters. Winston is interesting to me, though he unusually understood everything as we do now in q society where everyone else was so brainwashed. It was simply peculiar that he has such extensive knowledge of how destructive his society was rather than a slightly brainwashed perspective. (talk to me about this in class if you like, i canelaborate.)  My essential question from the previous review was ""how does one's wants affect what one does to achieve something?"" This goes well with this book just the same simply because of the ambition of both Winston as a human being and the Party as a whole. Winston being changed at the end (IN THE MOST INFURIATING WAY DAMN IT) reflects how something as simple as torture can reveal the fault of a human when it comes to desires versus purpose. ""Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves."" (p.211). This quote shows what happens to Winston close to the end for attempting to think freely and reach freedom as he has been trying to throughout this entire book, but being cut short because of his desire to keep all of the freedoms that he has learned of.  ""A world of fear and treachery and torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but MORE merciless, as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. ... In our world, there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph and self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy."" (p.220) This party represented throughout the book shows a key importance to my question. The wants of the party are to have a perfect world or society. This is supposed to be done through destruction of the very society they are attempting to refine. Big powers are very unlikely to fall, (JUST AS SEEN AT THE END OF THIS DAMN BOOK, AGH) but they are flawed. Things like perfection cannot be achieved unless there is not conflict, which would be the ambition, but destruction of society is the desire that kills their only possibility to reach perfection."
201,Somesh,"It is a stupendous task to write something about this book which might seem fit. The 'how' was the part which I enjoyed the most. The reasons supporting the argument about 'how' our world transitioned into the 1984 dystopian one seemed so convincing. By the middle of the novel, reader starts thinking that some revolution might be coming where Winston would burgeon as a hero and a savior. But, it doesn't. The story is not about heroism but about acceptance...acceptance and endurance of a common man.  Also, there are parts where O'Brien tries to convince Winston of the hypocrisies existing in IngSoc, and the reader sees himself accepting them as Winston was. The fact that Room 101 contains your own biggest fear can chill you to the bone.  In the end, it is proved that this novel is a love story not between Julia and Winston, but Winston and BIG BROTHER. The book is about how a person is made to fall in love with an idea which he despises ??? WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH"

204,Vanya,Absolutely amazing!
205,Noah,"This book is one of, if not, my FAVORITE book. It has elements of everything that make a book amazing. From the beginning to the end. THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING SO READ IT NOW."
206,Peter Walton-Jones,"This must be one of the world's most reviewed books, given its status as required reading in many schools and universities. Strangely enough I have only just read it for the first time this year. When I was at college I studied ""Animal Farm"" and i do remember enjoying both the reading AND the study...not something i always associate with my English texts. I feel that it is important to locate 1984 in its historical context. It was written in or around 1949 and the near and far histories of power, control, resistance, rebellion, revolution, and a variety of political and moral philosophies were fresh in the mind of the public. I would think then (as now), though, that they are little understood. And this scared Orwell. In ""1984"" he looks 30 something years to the future and speculates...""what if?"" Looking to Germany and Russia in particular, I feel that he feared for the gullibility and powerlessness of the masses (the ""low"") AND of the apathy of the ""middle"" for politics and power (until it is too late). The 3 mantras dictated by the ""high"" by 1984 are ""War is Peace"", ""Freedom is Slavery"", and ""Ignorance is Strength"". These make little sense...and neither does 2+2=5, but by 1984 those in power care little for sense or truth, just power itself, for its own sake, and therefore for control. The central story is a bleak but simple one. The two central characters are excruciatingly ordinary; but they at least have the sense to hate the centralised conformity required by ""Big Brother"". Their thought-rebellion becomes a love affair and briefly sparks hope for the reader. All that is firmly destroyed, and as such sent (and continues to send) the warning into the future that war, slavery, and ignorance in all forms ought to be resisted by all people, across all walks of life and at every strata of society."
207,Irina,"1984 is the kind of book that manages to inflict the same sensations (in this case, of powerlessness) as its characters are feeling and it does so through its style and twists of the plot.Amazing."
208,Thanaku,"Review update. Read it maybe a year ago.---------------------------------------------------------------------This has got to be the most blood curdling read of my lifetime. Filled with philosophical notions with the power to confound any individual, it is what a person can call a true dystopia in every sense. Hunger Games cowers at its feet like a puny rat. Just what am I doing? Hunger games can’t even be invoked in this context… nothing absolutely nothing can stay within a 12742 km radius of this book (the other end of Earth). It would shrivel and evanescent. So powerful and thought provoking is the concept it entails that the book is bound to haunt you not only during your lifetime but generations to come. Though it has been categorized as a novel, essay would be more befitting a term. A most powerful read that scares you and sends tremors coursing through your hair down deep into the follicles. Logically solid there is not a morsel of untrue that I could find in this book. It is what can be called a dystopia in the truest of senses. To complete the picture George Orwell included a jargon of his own called Newspeak which is the quintessence of human destruction. Okay now that I’ve got my bearings let me put my thoughts across in a decipherable manner. I will try as much not to spoil this but give you in as best a manner as possible a general notion of what makes this book so doubleplusgood(a Newspeak term-go by the literal meaning).Now a dystopia is defined as –‘’An oppressive government ….blah blah blah ”In simple terms where a person is stripped off of even the smallest tendrils of hope and the conditions imposed upon him so unimaginable that ceasing to exist would be a better alternative. George Orwell thinking thus came up with this world where the Earth is divided into three regions- Eastasia, Eurasia and Oceania. The society is explained to us by a one Mr. Winston Smith who you could call a divergent. The society has in it all of the above mentioned factors but along with it this one key element – ignorance numbness unthank on the part of an individual. To kill one self would be a better alternative but in order to do that the person must be able to feel that, to realize that his society is in fact a dystopia. Each of the three nations is an oligarchy -a totalitarian government. In Oceania the party overlooking the matters of state is headed by Big Brother and the ideologies of the party utterly crazy running thus-War Is PeaceFreedom Is SlaveryIgnorance Is StrengthAt first glance this seems utterly absurd and to think anyone would accept this would seem ridiculous but as you continue reading a complete paradigm shift takes place and the prospect no longer so farfetched. The book does not have much technological advancement to speak of but the people within the society are completely at the beck and call of the rulers. The word privacy no longer a perceivable term. To achieve this insane feat the measures undertaken by the party so completely preposterous and unimaginable …but …not impossible. Now if I were to tell you that to any person, one’s own life is more important than anything else and that Titanic is in reality a farce and absolutely an insane proposition, most would definitely argue. As you see it is in these acts of sacrifice that we see the true face of humanity. Only once that has been expunged can we completely attain monopoly over the world. ‘Cause with it will the world be plunged into a profound state of sheer numbness. No longer will an individual feel love or pleasure or lust. All his emotions melded into hate for the enemies of the party and undying love for the party (Big Brother) alone. Another crazy (yes crazy it is) thought is – The past is forever changing and the present controls it. Madness pure madness. But again not completely insurmountable a task. ‘Cause after all the past is in the memories of a person and if you can control an individual’s thought then would there even be need for Science?The book for the most part concentrates on the politics and the economics of such a society and if executed perfectly what it would result into. The ideology introduced in this book so confounding that it will without a doubt tickle your brain and send shivers simultaneously. Scary wouldn’t exactly be the right feeling…the book instills a deep rooted fear within you. The book is philosophical and to be honest I could not discern all the tiny details in the first read. Each of the sentences so intricately knit that it would most definitely take another read on my part to clearly appreciate its gore. Now that’s the thing about classics. None of the sentences mean what you think they mean.As you could infer from the temperament of the above prose, the book does not end on a good note. Nevertheless it is something that every individual must read just to stay wary if not for much else. "
209,Vaas,"Главный герой — Уинстон Смит — живёт в Лондоне, работает в министерстве правды и является членом внешней партии. Он не разделяет партийные лозунги и идеологию и в глубине души сильно сомневается в партии, окружающей действительности и вообще во всём том, в чём только можно сомневаться. Чтобы «выпустить пар» и не сделать безрассудный поступок, он покупает дневник, в котором старается излагать все свои сомнения. На людях же он старается притворяться приверженцем партийных идей. Однако он опасается, что девушка Джулия, работающая в том же министерстве, шпионит за ним и хочет разоблачить его. В то же время он полагает, что высокопоставленный сотрудник их министерства, член внутренней партии некий О’Брайен также не разделяет мнения партии и является подпольным революционером. Однажды оказавшись в районе пролов (пролетариев), где члену партии появляться нежелательно, он заходит в лавку старьёвщика Чаррингтона. Тот показывает ему комнату наверху, и Уинстон мечтает пожить там хотя бы недельку. На обратном пути ему встречается Джулия. Смит понимает, что она следила за ним, и приходит в ужас. Он колеблется между желанием убить её и страхом. Однако побеждает страх и он не решается догнать и убить Джулию. Вскоре Джулия в министерстве передаёт ему записку, в которой она признаётся ему в любви. У них завязывается роман, они несколько раз в месяц устраивают свидания, но Уинстона не покидает мысль, что они уже покойники (свободные любовные отношения между мужчиной и женщиной, являющимися членами партии, запрещены партией). Они снимают комнатку у Чаррингтона, которая становится местом их регулярных встреч. Уинстон и Джулия решаются на безумный поступок и идут к О’Брайену и просят, чтобы он принял их в подпольное Братство, хотя сами лишь предполагают, что он в нём состоит. О’Брайен их принимает и даёт им книгу, написанную врагом государства Голдстейном. Через некоторое время их арестовывают в комнатке у мистера Чаррингтона, так как этот милый старик оказался сотрудником полиции. В министерстве любви Уинстона долго обрабатывают. Главным палачом, к удивлению Смита, оказывается О’Брайен. Сначала Уинстон пытается бороться и не отрекаться от себя. Однако от постоянных физических и психических мучений он постепенно отрекается от себя, от своих взглядов, надеясь отречься от них разумом, но не душой. Он отрекается от всего, кроме своей любви к Джулии. Однако и эту любовь ломает О’Брайен. Уинстон отрекается, предаёт её, думая, что он предал её на словах, разумом, от страха. Однако когда он уже «излечен» от революционных настроений и на свободе, сидя в кафе и попивая джин, он понимает, что в тот момент, когда отрёкся от неё разумом, он отрёкся от неё полностью. Он предал свою любовь. В это время по радио передают сообщение о победе войск Океании над армией Евразии, после чего Уинстон понимает, что теперь он полностью излечился. Теперь он действительно любит партию, любит Старшего Брата…==========Лучшие книги, понял он, говорят тебе то, что ты уже сам знаешь.==========Уинстон, как человек утверждает свою власть над другими? Уинстон подумал. — Заставляя его страдать, — сказал он. — Совершенно верно. Заставляя его страдать. Послушания недостаточно. Если человек не страдает, как вы можете быть уверены, что он что он исполняет вашу волю, а не свою собственную?==========Свобода — это возможность сказать, что дважды два — четыре. Если дозволено это, то все остальное отсюда следует.==========Когда война становится бесконечной, она перестает быть опасной.==========Иерархическое общество возможно только на основе бедности и невежества.==========И если все принимают ложь, навязанную партией, если во всех документах одна и та же песня, тогда эта ложь поселяется в истории и становится правдой. «Кто управляет прошлым, – гласит партийный лозунг, – тот управляет будущим; кто управляет настоящим, тот управляет прошлым»"

211,Giada,"Credo di aver capito tutto e di non aver capito niente.SPOILER.O'Brien ha recitato? Ero davvero convinta che avrebbe cercato di fare qualcosa, che fingeva nel ministero dell'Amore, ma immagino cercassi scuse per non essere delusa da lui.Il che è esattamente quello che ho fatto per qualsiasi personaggio di questo libro, tentando di dar loro delle motivazioni comprensibili ai loro comportamenti.Questo libro serve a dimostrare che la mia prof di storia ha ragione nel dire che siamo facilmente controllabili proprio a causa della fiducia e della speranza che riponiamo fino alla fine?Forse sono troppo abituata a tutti i libri a carattere distopico attuali, tipo gli Hunger Games o altre saghe che non ho ancora finito ma di cui mi aspetto un certo finale. Ormai siamo tutti convinti che tutti i libri, per quante morti e torture si debbano sopportare nel processo, siano destinati ad avere un lieto fine. O quantomeno una fine che sia tale.Ho aspettato per un centinaio di pagine che arrivasse il punto in cui tutto sarebbe cambiato, mentre in realtà tutto quello che è successo a Winston è stato retrocedere e ""purificarsi"".Non so dire se 1984 mi sia piaciuto, forse perché sono una fan del Bene che vince il Male nonostrante spesso i cattivi siano i miei personaggi preferiti (ma sul serio credete che potrei idolatrare un cattivo che disintegra la possibilità di pensare e avere opinioni?), so solo che è stato un duro colpo che forse potrebbe avermi insegnato una lezione che ricorderò (cosa che indubbiamente ha fatto ma ancora non so se prenderò una posizione in merito, se darle importanza piuttosto che rimanere nella mia posizione a cavallo tra la misantropia e la speranza innata)."

213,Kshitij,To come up with a finer review.
214,Tarek,"Nineteen Eighty-Four was a book written by George Orwell based on the knowledge he had on the totalitarianism government of Nazi Germany. The book was taken place in a horrible England and basically answered the question of how England would be if the people were controlled by the government. The main character, Winston Smith, is a minor member of the ruling party but hates the totalitarianism control, which later on allows him to rebel privately by having a love life with a girl named Julia. Then decides to take his rebellion with Julia to a public matter and try to form a group, although he is caught by the government and is sent to a concentration camp where they tortured him to an extent where he has lost control of every good inside him and has finally become controlled by the government. Although the book is horrifying, it does have a positive look into it. The book shows the reader how hard it is to be controlled by certain people, and in this case, a government. Nineteen Eighty-Four was a great book and I enjoyed reading it. The book is for people who love history and asking the question ""what if?"". Over time this book has become the basis of other totalitarianism books, such as ""A Brave New World"", and is a great and exciting book. "
215,Mark Ryall,"It's been more than 20 years since I read this book. At that time I loved the bleakness but probably didn't grasp any of the political references.It is still completely devastating but about as perfect a novel as you can reasonably hope for. I'll put it on my reread once per decade list along such cheery classics as the trial, the castle, a clockwork orange and crime and punishment.To continue the dystopian shenanigans, next stop is watching the 1956 and 1984 film renditions and rereading brave new world."

217,Buck Ward,"I read 1984 two or three times in the era of about 1965 to 1975. One of those times I read it for the purpose of writing a college essay on it. I opined that the differences between the state of Orwell's 1984 and our own were of degree and not of kind. I felt that 1984 was a great and important book. Now, a generation or two later, I have read it again. I think it is the only book I've ever read more than twice. I still feel it is a great and important book. Anyone who hasn't read it should. 1984 is the ultimate dystopia, all the more so for being so plausible.In this latest reading, in my dotage, what struck me, similarities to our own times notwithstanding, were the differences between the state of 1984 and the state(s) in which we live today. As O'Brien pointed out to Winston, INGSOC, the party of Big Brother, is fundamentally different in its goals from the Catholic Inquisition, Nazism, and Soviet Communism, if not different in its methods. Another significant difference between INGSOC and modern America, for example, is the language. Newspeak, the burgeoning language of INGSOC is a contraction of English, a stultification, intended to stifle ideas, whereas modern English is a growing, evolving language, a language of innovation. This is certainly not to say that there are not in our society powerful ones who would control the past to control the future; who surveil the populace; whose followers are fully immersed in doublethink. Big Brother is watching you."
218,Derek,"George Orwell believed that restrictive language could limit free political thought. So it's sad that people have invented a word, ""Orwellian,"" that does exactly that. Simply apply the word to anything or anyone that you don't agree with to brand them a liar and a fascist (""fascism"" has also become a practically meaningless word that can be thrown at anything).This book has become such a part of the way that we talk about our society that I was convinced that I knew it without having read it. I was surprised at how nuanced the book was and what an engaging, well-constructed story it contained. It is rightly considered a classic."
219,Stephen Wagner,"The cover image is missing, which is unfortunate, as it is a fantastic cover. It is a small hard-bound book, from the early 60s. The cover is predominantly white, with a green rectangular border. The bottom half of the rectangle is empty, but the top half is filled with the colorful, bulging letters that make up the title and the author's name. ""George Orwell"" is two strong tones of blue in the background, while ""1984"" is fantastic in orange and pink, swelling past the author's name, pushing and stretching off of the cover. There is a good weight to the book, and the cover,the back, and the spine are thick and shiny. All slightly laminated to add to its ruggedness. And rugged it needed to be, as it was purchased to be read by countless students. The copy I encountered was owned by the high school I attended. I was a sophomore in high school, in the late 1980s and there was a bookshelf at the side of the classroom, filled with dozens and dozens, if not hundreds, of this book. I had heard of the book, and the row of them, lined up not far from where I sat each day drew me to it, to them. One day, in the middle of the year, our teacher mentioned that we would be reading a passage from the book, the next day, during class. But it was made clear that we would not be reading the entire book. (They were going to ruin it!) So I grabbed one off of the shelf, and read it feverishly that afternoon in my room, in one long, overwhelming sitting. I fell in love with it that day, and still love it now, all these years later. I never returned my copy. I went and found it on the shelf downstairs, just now, when I took a pause in the middle of writing this. It is here with me now. It is stamped ""Property of Town of Arlington No. T21 High School"" But I know better, as T21 is now mine.I know that the book is important because it examines a dystopian society. I know that. But I enjoy it primarily as a love story. It is, and always will be, one of my favorites."
220,T.W. Dittmer,Creepy. Great writing. Great story.
221,Gregory Steiner,"George Orwell is one of the more interesting writers I've read in a while. He has a way of writing that, even when there isn't much going on, you are still glued to the book. I think it's because his prose is just so pleasant and flowing. "

223,Gina,"This book changed my life forever. I read it in my senior year of high school when my teacher had a dystopian theme for the semester, that's pretty much all we read. All of a sudden I found myself questioning WHY governments do things? I started being more curious about more than just my teenage life. This book totally influenced my writing of The Adventures of Bianca Sukiyama."
224,HusamAldeen Alshloul,"Really nice book, It makes you think of the present. Even though the party and it's policies are way far from what we are living now, it makes you think how politics and language and media can change the peoples thoughts.Really fun reading, although it took me TOO LONG to finish because I had exams and so on, but it is great."
225,William,"I reread this classic work by George Orwell hoping to get more out of it now than when I was 20 when I read it for the first time. I did, and not only because I had changed (and...ahem...matured) but because our society has too. Back in the early nineties, cell phones, the internet and social media were in their infancy or not yet born. But now, with facebook, Twitter and texting, the sobering thought of having a Big Brother always watching is more reality than fiction.Orwell seems to have known that one day our reality would be heavily influenced by our own perception of what is real, and not on the actual events or people involved. One need only look at the myriad websites postulating that historic events like the Moon Landing in 1969 and the terrorist attacks in New York in 2001 were part of an elaborate plan by the American government to ""push"" its people towards a particular political or social agenda. Now, I am not saying these events did not happen as described by the media, but the moment people start to question the authenticity of these events, you have to wonder whose point of view is ""reality"".Oh, and I checked with a math teacher friend of mine, and 2 + 2 still equals 4...for now. "
226,Ruba Bakeer,"This made me go through ""doublethink"", and i can't make up my mind!Certainly Worth every minute i've spent reading it."
227,T4ncr3d1,"""Raccontare deliberatamente menzogne e nello stesso tempo crederci davvero, dimenticare ogni atto che nel frattempo sia divenuto sconveniente e poi, una volta che ciò si renda di nuovo necessario, richiamarlo in vita dall'oblio per tutto il tempo che serva, negare l'esistenza di una realtà oggettiva e al tempo stesso prendere atto di quella stessa realtà che si nega, tutto ciò è assolutamente indispensabile.""Ebbene sì, finalmente sono riuscito a leggere il capolavoro della distopia inglese di metà novecento.Per poter apprezzare a pieno questo romanzo, bisogna capire esattamente che cos'è e che cosa vuole dirci il suo autore. Perché se viene presentato come un romanzo che inneggia all'amore, che è più forte di qualunque dittatura, siamo completamente fuori strada. La storia di amore tra Winston e Julia è un puro e semplice accadimento. Qualcosa che non era previsto, ma che è comunque accaduto, senza riuscire a cambiare nulla: tanto più che non c'è alcun lieto fine.Del resto, 1984 non è Fahreneit 451, non è V per Vendetta.1984 dev'essere letto come un romanzo distopico ed un capolavoro di scienze politiche. E' un trattato di scienze politiche travestito da romanzo: se lo si accetta, lo si può apprezzare totalmente.Che l'obiettivo primario di Orwell sia stato parlare di politica e non di amore, è chiaro: tutta la prima parte è dedicata alla descrizione del regime del Socing; la seconda parte, nella quale si sviluppa la storia d'amore, contiene la lettura del ""libro"": lunghe e lunghe pagine di questo immaginario trattato contro la dittatura. Può sembrare ostico, ma non lo è: Orwell traduce in parole povere una lunga tradizione mittleuropea di scienza politica. Pur non essendo mai esplicitamente citata, la nota ""teoria delle elites"" è praticamente il nucleo fondamentale del suo discorso.E' questa lucida analisi della storia politica dell'uomo, animale sociale, che mostra la grandezza di Orwell: non la pura narrazione dei fatti (che pure appare molto semplice e asciutta, con un discreto narratore in terza persona ed una certa introspezione psicologica). Qui emerge l'Orwell politico, fine pensatore, opinionista, con le sue idee e le sue contraddizioni: è così sicuro del pericolo di una conquista del mondo da parte del socialismo, che il mondo di 1984 è diviso in tre grandi stati socialisti-totalitari. Ma a ben vedere di socialismo non c'è nulla: più e più volte viene detto che a iterarsi al potere è sempre la solita vecchia oligarchia (a questo punto mi chiedo che senso ha continuare ad abbracciare la bandiera dell'anticomunismo. Ma vabhé. A ognuno il suo).Rimangono poi delle idee assolutamente geniali, pericolosamente geniali. Quando Orwell descrive tutte le strategie di controllo da parte del Partito, non lo fa per il puro piacere di fare fantapolitica. Il bipensiero, ad esempio, è un'intuizione assolutamente geniale. A distanza di più di mezzo secolo, non è difficile trovare ancora tracce di questo ""bipensiero"".1984 è dunque, infine, un romanzo eterno: perché eterno ed universale è il suo messaggio.Tutti siamo invitati a leggerlo: per non rimanere gli ""ultimi uomini in Europa"".

229,Mike (the Paladin),"I was so young when I read this I had trouble understanding it (I'd read Animal Farm). This is one of those books everyone should read, especially now. I went up from 4 (readablity) to 5 based on this book's place in the world, what it says and what it warns.Update: 11/16/12I still highly recommend this book...I'd also recommend Brave New World as that book seems to be more the way we're heading at this point in history. Still If you've read Soft Despotism, Democracy's Drift: Montesquieu, Rousseau, Tocqueville, and the Modern Prospect you'll see the way things tend to head historically.Still highly recommended. "
230,Hussain Mohammed,لا اجد كلمات تصف هذه الرواية.. هي فوق الوصف! عشت معها وبتفاصيلها واحسست بالام ونستون، اذا ردت عن تقرأ عن الطغيان والظلم والسيطرة على العقول فهاي احسن رواية تلخص كلشي، يجب ان تكون في كل بيت وان تقرأ وتقرأ من جديد. انا واقرأها كلت هل يوجد مثال حي حاليا على احداث الرواية؟ اعتقد كوريا الشمالية احسن مثال.
231,Hai Yen Pham,"When I first finished 1984, even though I felt that the book was definitely a hard-but-must-read timeless classic, it might be somewhere between 4 and 5 stars only because as a novel it lacked some of the turning points in story development and sometimes was too repetitive (all those long passages about political views and society setup required me to take a break every once a while to digest the information, but I guess it is inevitable for a dystopia novel?). However, after giving it some thought I decide that 1984 deserves a 5-star rating for it incredibly well-built dystopia and the author's vision/ideals of an totalitarian/communism society at the most extreme level from the point of view of a disappointed Marxist (Orwell was a Socialist but he hated Communism in practice).It took a genius like George Orwell to write such a novel in the year of 1948. Not only it described the phases of society and revolution but it also helped to expose the nature of power, class conflict, and the ruling methods imposed by different oligarchies throughout human history. The creativity, knowledge and mental strength of Orwell were amazing with which he built up a world with all elements of totalitarianism that we might think about but underestimated their importance and effect on citizens: Propaganda, Love/Sexuality, Independence/Identity/Individuality, Music, Loyalty, Poverty, Wealth, Technology, and Language. The politics is not easy to absorb, but I think for twenty-something people you are likely to have better understanding about this world/our society and take it more serious by reading 1984. It's advisable to read Animal Farm prior to 1984 since these two were written in a logical and chronological order, and I personally think that Animal Farm (an easy read with allegory) would help you a lot to digest 1984 (a heavy political dystopia)."
232,Ahmed Salem,"It is amazing, how can a writer in 1948 could have all this imagination about things and techs that happen in the future! Yet it is very black drama about how our world could be in a very rude and cruel when it is controlled and dominated by holistic systems and administrations!!"
233,Sean O'Hare,"I would swear that Bush could read and got a lot of his best/worst ideas from this book. The Department of Homeland Security is so Orwellian it makes my spine twitch. War is Peace, Everybody! War is Peace!"
234,M.m.f,"Estoy segura que tuve una reacción muy extraña. Empecé a llorar, y ahora si quisiera, podría seguir. Un retrato horrible de la verdad y de lo que los humanos son capaces, para bien o para mal, debido a su idiotez o a su brillantez. Lo que más me choco sin duda fue ese final, que demuestra la desesperanza del autor referido a los hombres. De lo que estoy segura, este libro me pareció tan perfecto, porque llego en un momento indicado."
235,Tania Hahn,"Probably, everything that could have been said about this book has already been said. So I'm just going to say one thing that I really disliked, I understand why, but I still dislike a lot.Of course, this is one of the best books I have ever read, but it seemed to me that the society of 1984 was misogynist and homophobic. Basically because of the way Winston thinks about Julia at the begging (the desire of raping her) and how man were able to enjoy sex but woman not (in the APpendix is said). And homophobic because (in the Appendix) it's said that homosexual relationships were a perversion.I understand that when this book was written, the whole society was misogynist and homophobic. But I just would like someone to have thought a future were you weren't considered less for being a woman or homosexual.Still I really loved it and it might be one of my favorites books ever."
236,Aisha,"This book is amazing. Read it. I love the way Orwell only really interacts with three characters: Winston, Julia and O'Brien. *SOME SMALL SPOILERS* This is the first book where I've (honestly?) wanted the main character to die... I appreciate that the ending isn't a 'happy ending' which I feel that I've become somewhat used to, instead it is the truth for what would happen at the time. Why should these characters get a special treatment just because Orwell chose to write about them. It wasn't until now that I realised I have been spoilt with happy endings, or even just by a satisfying one. This is not satisfying or 'joy-filling' but I appreciate that. Orwell really submerges into this world, the added details he writes such a Goldstein's book just amazed me. Sure they were sometimes tough to read at 11:30pm when all you wanted to know what happens next. But I feel like it's meant I, too, was submerged into this world. The appendix written is also fascinating about how the language of Newspeak works. The details just amaze me. So definitely one to read, I don't know why I put it off for so long.READ. IT. NOW. "
237,Casey Bell,"so much truth and relevance that you might have to savor this book over an order of fries to feel more human than not. i read this book sophomore year of high school from a teacher i thought was quite arrogant turns out he was just a genius introducing us younglings to orwell's best piece in my opinion. I still demand no explanation from this quaint novel, and i've thought alot about how the great gatsby and 1984 parallel..my '''theories'''anyways please read this if it calling out to your bones somehow. it sweetly nourished my understanding of humanity possibly different social systems and maybe it created an edge of understanding communism?? utopia no dystopia yes....but it's such a reality he creates like wow. it made me realize that our reality is different from that of every other thing (obviously) but like does anyone ever think a squirel's intelligence is miniscule because it's reality is collecting and everything it does is surrounded around that; hibernation, babymaking, climbing in trees, quick movements. also if you haven't already realized the song 'Live in Dreams' by Wild Nothing IS COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY BASED OFF OF THIS BOOK I SWEAR. Now all I need is sufjan stevens to write a ballad about this, and i'll be set. "
238,Russ Woody,"Hadn't read this since high school. Much more terrifying now, since so much of it has come true. "
239,Corinne,"Powerful, scary in its prescience. "
240,Corinna,"Era parecchio tempo che non leggevo un libro che riusciva a mettermi così tanta ansia e angoscia addosso.. Sono comunque felice di averlo letto! So già che anche tra qualche mese ripenserò a 1984 e troverò altri spunti di riflessione.Lettura davvero consigliata, ma chi è che ancora non ha letto questo libro?! Io non mi decidevo ad iniziarlo, ma adesso ho La fattoria degli animali che mi osserva dalla libreria e non penso che aspetterò un'altro anno XD"
241,Pasha,"Terrific!Imagine a world where the word ""free"" has only the meaning ""being empty"". Imagine a world where you should think how the state says. Where 2x2=5, if the state says so. Orwell built up this completely horrifying dystopic world.Winston Smith lives in Oceania. There also are two other powerful states: Euarasia and Eastasia. Though everyone lives in misery, the news constantly say there are important achievements. The documents are falsified every day. This is Winston's job, this is what he does. He isn't stupid. He hates the party with all his heart. But terrible things will happen if he even thinks the way he shouldn't. because BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU. They see and hear everything you do. So he pretends. Isn't it what we do all the time? We say things they want to hear for our own sake.There is also a particular language they starting to use. It makes people talk without thinking. It makes people degrade. Degrading people are easy to manipulate. Everything is about control.The other thing Orwell brings up in this novel is betrayal. There are things we cannot stand. Fear makes us forget about everyone and everything we love. Not necessarily death, just fear. Once it's right in front of our face, we will betray anyone. We will say ""Do it with him/her, not me!"" THAT is what betrayal is really about.1984 is one convincing horror story with no happy end. While reading it I couldn't help myself but think about North Korea. It feels like they're taking ideas from this book.If you ask me to make up a motto from 1984, it would be ""Question everything and don't let anyone control you."""
242,Paul,"1984 has been on my ""I need to read this"" list for quite some time and I kept putting it off for unknown reasons. I finally was able to check it out from the library electronically as it had a wait list the last several months. Essentially I finished this in just a couple of days and was amazed by the story and society that Orwell created.It is easy to see how this story is ranked as a classic. The concepts of Big Brother, Thought Police, and the disturbing way in which society has lost all sense of individual thought was striking. Orwell painted an amazing picture of a future that is incredibly scary. Though 1984 has come and gone pieces of it can be seen in today's society. Crazy! Interesting characters and detailed picture of buildings, offices, back streets, black markets, etc. made for an entertaining read. It was difficult to read only because I felt for the plight of Winston Smith. Orwell has earned his ""classic"" spot with 1984. Pick it up and feel disturbed immediately."
243,Mary Ann Davis,"I first read 1984 in college and for years now it's been one of my closest 'book-friends.'George Orwell the writer is also one of my 'friends.' He's among a handful of writers whose essays, books and poems I've completely read.I wish I'd known Orwell and his wife. He wrote such comfortable things, like how to brew a cup of tea and that a writer must have a comfortable chair.But 1984 points to a life without these pleasant, simple things. One of his essays says that every book must have a political base. I think of 1984 as a clear description of a world without the personal.1984's world is a hideous contrast to our own bright, cheerful existence. His world has but one point of view to follow and a population that carefully does what it’s told. They are numb, moving through 1984 with cold, unfeeling, hideously detached minds.As a writer, now of popular romantic fiction, I feel that Orwell constructed a satisfying world. It really sticks to your ribs. Each scene piles up the details, like the constant snooping, 2-way wall screens/TV’s one cannot escape, long hours, dust-like food, thin clothing, screaming planes. It's a future carefully lacking all charm, love and romance. The heroine, when she's in the throes of an affair, is strangely coquettish; her lover mentally notes the suppleness of her limbs and her small waist. Later, the hero compares his ex-lover's stiff, clumsy body with the woman he knew before they were tortured.Altogether the hero is more finely drawn and we see this no-exit world through his eyes and the narration. I do not consider this as a 'genre' piece. I respect science fiction deeply and I write fantasy, but 1984 is not ephemeral; it is fine literature. 1984 does what Lucretius and the early critics said that literature should do. It 'moves' us as if we’re struck by lightning. "
244,Via,"1984 gives me the chills as it makes me think: how was it possible that George Orwell, more than half a century ago, was able to put up a world that almost, if not similar, described the world we are in now?Set in Oceania, under the tyranny of the omniscient and enigmatic Big Brother, everything was controlled and designed to make the Party the most powerful of all. The world of 1984 was divided into three powerful superstates, Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, believed to be in a ""perpetual war"" and constantly forming and breaking alliances with each other. One day Oceania is in alliance with Eurasia, the other day with Eastasia...and they will always make it seem that whoever they have an alliance with has always been like that since the beginning, to the point that if history needs to be rewritten, they will. Everything was made to look as if it was the normal way of living. WAR IS PEACE.1984 was written in that time when Communism was at large, which is why it probably shows a bit of Marx in it. The war between the superstates was designed to expend human labor, all its products and everything in between. People were made to work, to eat, to drink, to breathe, to live in favor of the Party. If they show any form of disagreement or revolt, they will be tortured and brainwashed to maintain the political and economical structure of the state. Some were denied of existence, deleted in history or memory. Unperson. Telescreens were everywhere. Everyone was being watched. Every action was controlled. Every word spoken, every thought, every emotion. Even your family and children will turn you in. It was survival. If you want to live, you have to work with ""them"" and put up with the rules. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. Because...""Big Brother is watching you.""Furthermore, Oceania was divided into three classes: the upper class (Inner Party), the middle class (Outer party) and the lower class (Proles, from the word proletariat). The Inner Party is the minority of the population, the ruler of the state. Together with the Outer Party, they uphold the laws to maintain its power. Obviously, those with the resources, the knowledge, the wealth, are the ones who rule the resourceless, the proles, the uneducated working class, who will always remain the same because they will forever be ""ignorant"" to show resistance. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. and this strength will always be in favor of the upper class.From here, I ask these questions:What if we are living in a world where we think we are free even if, in truth, we are being controlled and just going with the flow? What if the language we speak now was designed to control and limit our thoughts? What if the past we know was modified, rewritten and built to further strengthen the power of our rulers? What if somebody is really watching over our every move?Orwell has made a visionary masterpiece. Truly, he is the king of dystopian literature because, along with Animal Farm, 1984 is probably one of the most disturbing, horrifying, psycho version of a dystopian world. It gives you goosebumps, and it haunts you. It makes you think of the past, present and future, and this novel truly deserves being included in every person's to-read list."
245,Shannon Stephenson,"I read “1984” and I found it to be a very interesting but a very slow read. Orwell wrote it in the 1940s. He goes to great detail to show his characters personalities throughout the story. Even though he only goes into describing three character mainly through out the book. The book is honestly a huge confusion, with the characters in the book don't really know what is happening in their world either.The details and confusion in this book made it a very slow read, I would recommend it to anyone that believes in conspiracies, or has interest about governments should read this book. I enjoyed the main characters relationship even though it wasn't very obvious Orwell made it to where they were all connected. Plus the secret love affair which the main character Winston has. My favorite part of this book would definitely have to be that it relates to the world, and what really is happening around you. It may be a slow read but it was very interesting to read with the creepy feeling it had left after every page. If it wouldn't had connected to the world and I probably wouldn't have kept reading it. I found the ending to be contradicting to the beginning, and very unbelievable. "

247,Chad,"Holy crap. This book scared the shit out of me when I first picked it up in the 8th grade, and it recently it scared me again. Except this time it wasn't a science fiction novel, it was all too real. I read this at the height of the Bush years and I was paranoid for days. Instead of Big Brother we had the Christian Right Wing and the FCC with their moral police and monitored airwaves. Orwell is a journalist and a rebel. He knows that dictatorships is a religious sect that kills the imagination, soul by soul. The Western world hasn't got quite this close to a totaliarian system, but if the Hannity's and Glen Beck's and Rush Limbaugh's get their way a lot of liberals will be locked in their gray dwellings, forced to watch evangelists and uber nationalists forcing us to eat fear and hate on a daily diet. The reason I love, truly love this book is because Orwell doesn't just stick to the politics and preach to his readers, he gets to the meat of the story and shows that love, true love, is the first victim of a dictatorship. Brilliant. A book every so-called punk rocker should read. "
248,Vik,"There are not many novels that introduce political and social concepts into society at large, big brother from 1984 is a rare exception. Enough said really"
249,Vin,"“Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.”This tome describes my biggest fears flawlessly and helps me understand certain thoughts that haunt me. I have an intense and irresistible desire for freedom and truth. Consequently, you could say that I’m not wired for routine and enjoy taking risks. ‘Cogito ergo resisto’; I think, therefore, I resist. Subsequently I dread the Dystopia Orwell describes in his book. After reading 1984, I wasn’t able to look at the real world in the same way. I can’t help but contemplate how this novel may have been used as a manual by those who have been in power to kilter our world after World War II. It no longer seems to be a work of speculative fiction to me. After reading 1984, I had to pick up and devour Maddox’ ‘Alphabet of manliness’, in order to man up and walk out into the real world again. This pretty much explains why I currently look like a lumber jack and am not too fond of mindless obedience. Yes, Chuck Norris is awesome!"
250,Simeon Atanasov,"Great and overwhelming book. One may find the similarities between the society described in the book and the one we live in.The book makes you think about the social order. It shows one that the self preservation instincts are at first in the human nature.In conclusion, Winston Churchill once said “democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others”"
251,Marisa Gisell,Outstanding. I'm still in awe. This book is simply amazing! I'm still blown up by it's plot twists
252,Marie Gentilcore,I read this in high school and then I would re-read it every year for many years of my young adulthood. I think it is as true today as when it was written... unfortunately :(
253,Mostafa Fakhry,الرواية جميلة جدا .... رغم أن الروائية اللي فيها قليلةو أنا شايفها بتعرض توقع مستقبلي للكاتب في شكل واقع قصصي ..الجزء النفسي و الاجتماعي في الرواية مثمر جدا ...قصة استحمار شعب ..قرأت الرواية باللغة الأنجليزية أثناء سماعها صوتيا في 13 تسجيل كل تسجيل 44 دقيقة .أنا فخور أن قرأتها .سماع التسجيلات صوتيا ساهم في سهولة قراءتها باللغة الانجليزية رغم لغتها الصعبة جدا و خلي الاستفادة منها مضاعفة .
254,Blindzider,"I waffled back and forth on whether this should be 4 or 5 stars. For 5 stars, the importance of the society this book describes where all actions and even thoughts are controlled cannot be understated. Clearly it is an extreme, but a country/world where every moment of your life is in some way controlled by a ruling party is a danger everyone needs to be aware of. The depths of detail that Orwell goes into in describing what life is like is astonishing not to mention depressing. For 4 stars, while there is a main character, they are merely used as a tool for the author to come up with situations in order to explain the depravity of the situation or how specific aspects of the society have come about. There isn't quite enough of Winston I think to really have me vested in his future, and while he does go through a character arc it feels as though it's just a means to an end. There are times when pages are spent describing how things came to be and they seem to shove aside the development of the protagonist.Clearly this is a landmark novel and should be read by all. I don't know if I would classify it as ""entertaining"" or ""uplifting"" but it is certainly memorable."
255,Thomas McCauley,"1984 is the instruction manual for all of the owners of our society...systematic surrender of freedoms for the illusion of security against an unnamed & ever changing foe in a war that never ends...i was in high school when i 1st read 1984 & i thought that it was incredible that all of the things going on in the book seemed 2 be lining up like the sun & moon for a total eclipse of reason & independent thought. however, that was during the relatively calm pre-fear & war mongering days of president clinton & no one would listen 2 me about the undeniable & inherit foolishness involved with trading liberty for a false sense of security. today everyone just looks the other way because they want to feel ""safe"" or just comply with whatever the status quo is so that they can make money & survive...notice all of the young soldiers dying daily because there's no other careers for them, or civilians working for boeing building war machines because somehow they do not understand how what they do is destroying the earth. everyone seems 2 think that making money & ""protecting"" themselves is somehow different than loving & protecting each other. people always use the words culture & community 2 describe the specific places they live & things that they do, but earth is our real community & all of our silly differences & similarities is our global culture.

259,Nick Twinamatsiko,"George Orwell's masterpiece is seasoned with many profound insights. The one I found particularly striking was this: 'Dont you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make Thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.' Apart from suggesting that, by controlling a people's language, you can control their thought processes, George Orwell actually demonstrated it in the novel, for one of the techniques he uses to convey our minds into the grim world he envisions is to invent words and phrases like Thoughtcrime, Facecrime, Thought Police. That he invented words when the corresponding realities didn't yet exist is testimony to his genius, and gives Nineteen Eighty-Four a special place in literature.'The best books,' he also notes, 'are those that tell you what you already know.' I found Nineteen Eighty-Four an extremely good book by this measure because, at the time I read it, I had been conjecturing that the ideological bankruptcy of most african leaders is related to their linguistic bankruptcy - to their confinement to the shallow ends of both their vernaculars and the European languages. Orwell's theory of thought and language affirmed my conjecture.The novel is extremely insightful. Indeed, when I read it, and considered that Orwell was dying as he wrote it, and recalled two other masterpieces that were written by dying people - Wuthering Heights and Brothers Karamazov - I wondered whether people in their latest hours experience some special inspiration. "
260,Carlie Russell,Heartstrings pulled This is one of the rare causes that I actually loved readings every single page of a book. Orwell has such an incredible writing writing style; it's very easy to understand yet still entertaining. He uses the perfect amount of difficult vocabulary. This book will completely brake your morals but in the most amazing way possible. Orwell has the power completely capturing his audiences' attention and he does not fail in 1984. Please even if you hate reading you have to get this book a try. It is incredibly well-written and such entrancing story with an amazing underlying theme. If I could give 1984 more than five stars I definitely without a doubt would. 
261,Liana George,"This was the first book to ever make me feel compelled to write a review.I have read many a disturbing book in my days, but nothing moved me quite to this extent. Firstly, to whomever wants to read something 'for pleasure' - do not read this book. This book will not bring pleasure to any sane person. It will disturb you, provoke you, and most probably haunt you for a long period after you have finished reading it. Dystopian stories are quite the trend with our generation, so I did not expect many surprises from this book. Boy, was I wrong. For one, the whole concept of Newspeak enthralled me. I am quite a sucker for a good piece of authentic philology in a novel, and have not had that itch scratched this good since Tolkien's Lord of the Rings (for God's sake, that man invented languages with dialects and regionalisms and... but this is a subject for another time). However, I have never imagined the concept of reducing a language rather than enriching it. It's so counter-intuitive, so twisted, and yet so appropriate in the context of Oceania, the Party and it's never-ending quest for the complete reduction of the essence of human nature; it must begin and end with the language - which decreases in nuance as the Party grows more powerful and eats away at the people's humanity and spirit until it turns them into complete mindless beasts. This is particularly emphasized by the ultimate desired form of Newspeak - the duckspeak, or the act of quacking like a duck - basically eradicating articulate human communication all together. This concept shook me to the core - more than the explicit torture scenes. The act of penetrating, spoiling, disfiguring one's very soul, trying (and succeeding) to take over their identity and the one thing that gives us most privacy - our own mind. Nothing disturbs me more than the idea of rape, and this was one of the most brutal acts of rape I have ever read - when everything that is intimate about a person is completely invaded, deformed, mocked, until they themselves no longer recognize it, forgetting who or even WHAT they really are. It culminates with the worst and saddest case of Stockholm syndrome that I have ever read about (and I thought Theon Greyjoy in A Game of Thrones was bad). Needless to say, I hoped until the end that he will be able to salvage a little piece of his spirit, a feeling, a thought of his own that would make him die still being himself. But this is just not one of those novels, and the power of the book is vastly based on that. This book convinced me that George Orwell was indeed a WRITER, in the most pure sense of the word. His work, depressing as it may be, is very eye-opening and mind-expanding in so many ways. 1984 is definitely one of those books that changes you a little.I think everyone should read this book, because we all need a reminder of how important the most basic things in life are, those that we so often take for granted - family, privacy, knowledge access, and most importantly the universe that exists within each and every one of us which we are sometimes too busy to explore or nurture. We never think of what it would be like to be robbed of that, because we can hardly imagine ourselves without it. This book is teaching humanity a very tough lesson about the dangers the hunger for power can entail. "
262,Malou ♡,"I am speechless, this book is amazing. Multiple times throughout reading it I was so surprised. I kept on trying to predict what was going to happen but the unpredictable would always happen. Please do yourself a favor and read it. 1984 is easily one of my favorite books."
263,Doaa Ali,"سينعدم كل ولاء ليس للحزب، وسيباد كل حب غير حب الأخ الكبير، ولن يكون هناك ضحك إلاّ الضحك الذى يصحب نشوة النصر على العدو المقهور، ولن يكون هنالك فن أو أدب او علم، فحينما تجتمع فى أيدينا كل أسباب القوة لن تكون بنا حاجة إلى العلم.جورج أورويل لم يكتب عن الخيال رغم أنه قد فعل، بل كتب عن المستقبل الذى نحياه بكثير من الحنكة وقليل من المبالغة. هذه الرواية كتبت للتاريخ وستظل مرجع هام يعود له كل من يبحث عن سمات الديكتاتورية والديكتاتوريين. أنصح كل عربى أن يقرأ هذه الرواية لأنه حتماً سيجد أصنامه قابعة بين السطور تلوح له:""ها أنا موجودة فى كل زمان ومكان أنتظر من يؤمنون بى"" "
264,Sonia,"Lo leí hace casi dos meses, pero lo tengo tan fresco como si lo hubiese leído ayer, y creo que con las dos obras que he leído de Orwell me pasa, lo que significa que es su mérito y no mío.Este es un libro complejo, pero eso ya todos los sabemos. Más allá del control sobre las acciones, lo que más me impactó fue la manera de controlar incluso el pensamiento de las personas, porque de esa forma el acceso a las decisiones tomadas es mucho más directa y sencilla. Y refleja tanto el mundo real que es casi espeluznante. Debo decir que hubo fragmentos que parecían incluso noticias de la actualidad, así que tenía que recordar constantemente la fecha de publicación de esta obra e intentar no desasosegarme.Inculcada una doctrina sin más opción que adoptarla, es improbable que una persona mire su entorno en busca de otra alternativa, sobre todo si vive con la convicción de que tal no existe.Un protagonista bastante anormal. Y es anormal por el simple hecho de ser un personaje totalmente normal, cuyas habilidades no son extraordinarias ni tiene nada demasiado especial, sino que, a diferencia de la caracterización de hoy en día, no se centra en lo pueril; más bien abarca lo necesario y más allá sin ser exagerado, desde lo que todo ser humano ve, siente y piensa (generalizando, claro está. Lo que se espera de todo mortal) hasta lo más profundo del ser, eso que no se toca en muchos libros por ser algo incómodo, extraño o material de censura. O sencillamente porque vende más hacer un personaje perfecto. Aquí tenemos un personaje tan humano, con sus procesos y sufrimientos, pero también con la parte que lo hace único sin punto de comparación. No es un personaje sentimental ni dado a las relaciones, pero sabe identificar lo que siente, por qué lo siente y qué debe hacer en consecuencia. Y no se avergüenza de ello. Reconoce sus carencias y llegados a un punto, empieza a actuar conforme a lo que cree necesitar. Es un personaje tan complejo, que resulta difícil establecer un patrón con base en su modo de operar. Sucede que en este libro, armar una opinión por el modo de actuar de un personaje es quedarse en la superficie, porque todos tienen un modo establecido que debe cumplirse irremediablemente; sin embargo, los pensamientos siempre van más allá. En este caso, tomar la decisión de pensar es lo que hace que vayamos más allá.Hay, no obstante (y esto es difícil de explicar), un punto intermedio bastante perceptible en esta obra, que se queda entre el pensamiento y la acción, una mínima fracción, que hace una gran diferencia entre persona y persona. Quizá se deba a que la mayoría de las personas prefieren no pensar en absoluto y permanecer en la seguridad de la esclavitud con la que se han conformado, pero no es preciso decir qué es exactamente lo que hace que conozca a Winston completamente. Es más bien un conjunto de elementos, detalles mínimos que comprenden un todo.Por eso precisamente me ha gustado la manera de abordarlo de Orwell. Winston es uno del montón, familiarizado con lo que debe hacer intentando ignorar lo que una persona normal podría querer, y aun así, da un paso que, aunque con un margen mínimo de éxito, lo hace diferente del resto. Es porque piensa. Porque sabe que la ignorancia es lo que limita a unos y da más libertad a otros para mover a conveniencia. Es precisamente porque reconoce que la ignorancia es esclavitud, y sabe, de cualquier forma, que saberlo supone un riesgo casi doloroso desde el principio.Es demasiado real, tanto que es imposible convencerse de lo contrario, de que no existen personas así, que no es posible. Pero sí es muy posible. Y el final ha sido el toque perfecto para el realismo de esta magnífica obra. Es como si desde el principio, por mera observación del entorno, supiera cómo terminará. Porque un cambio no se da al chasquear los dedos, y en este caso es un proceso bastante lento (o imposible) que ni siquiera se da al final. Quizá por eso no me sorprendió del todo el final, pero no por eso me gustó menos. Al contrario, se me hizo doloroso confirmar mis sospechas.Partiendo de aquí, podemos hacer una lista interminable (y que por cierto, Orwell menciona casi por completo) de lo que es capaz de hacer un ser humano corrupto con el fin de obtener cada vez más poder sobre el resto del mundo, no solo apropiándose de lo que hacen, sino monitoreando lo que piensan y debilitando la mentalidad del hombre hasta convertirla en un vacío dispuesto para inculcar cualquier comportamiento. Porque aquí no se estipula pensar en algo determinado. Aquí está prohibido pensar.Y hay tanto que decir que temo irme por las ramas, si es que no lo hice ya, pero para hablar de todo lo que se incluyó en él temo que necesitaría memorizarlo o, como mínimo, leerlo otro par de veces (lo cual haré sin duda ni problema, más bien encantada).Una de las cosas que mi memoria guardará por siempre es la idea de que quizá puedan controlar algún día nuestros pensamientos, pero estamos compuestos de algo más que eso, algo que no resta importancia a nuestro modo de pensar, pero sí que puede ser utilizado como arma en caso de que se nos arrebate esta posibilidad de tener dominio sobre nuestra mente. Porque es nuestra naturaleza, porque estamos configurados para dominar lo que somos. El problema de muchos es que delegan esa autoridad a otros, una autoridad que es inherente a cada uno y que no pertenece a nadie más que a nosotros mismos.«Hasta que no tengan consciencia de su fuerza, no se rebelarán, y hasta después de haberse rebelado, no serán conscientes. Éste es el problema».«Si pueden obligarme a dejarte de amar... ésa sería la verdadera traición».Es un libro necesario para despertar la sensibilidad a la realidad del mundo (no de un país... del mundo. Casi lo suplico más que recomendarlo.«En una época de engaño universal, decir la verdad es un acto revolucionario»."
265,Basim Mahmoud, Dear George OrwellHooooooow did you write it ?!!!!!!!!!!!!!
266,Jón,"
Did you know that 2+2=5 was actually a thing? This 1931 poster pretty much sums it up - the text in Cyrillic roughly translates as ""The arithmetic of an industrial-financial counter-plan plus enthusiasm of workers"". It used to be plastered all over Moscow by the Communists as an encouraging slogan for fulfilling the first five-year plan - the 'pyatiletka' - in advance, overriding basic arithmetic and, undoubtedly, reasonable estimates as well. Suffice to say, it failed dramatically, hence even resulting in a famine which took the lives of hundreds of thousands.

( يجب استثناء الولاء للخالق من هذه الحالة ) .- من يُسيطر على الماضى ، يسيطر على المستقبل . و من يسيطر على الحاضر ، يسيطر على الماضى .- نحن أموات لا حياةَ لنا إلا فى المستقبل الذى سوف نُسهم فى بنائه كذرات غُبار أو كشظايا عظام . ( لا يهم أن ترى النصر مُحققًا أمامك ، و لكن ما يهم هو أن تموت و أنت على الطريق نحو ذاك النصر )- وجود المرء بين أقلية -حتى لو كانت هذه الأقلية تتألف من فرد واحد فحسب- لا يجعله مجنونًا . ( أنت الجماعة و لو كنت وحدك )"
268,Xitsuka,"The intertwine of sublime ideology and corporeal rebellion is marvelous. The declaration of the essence of libido/the will to power is equally marvelous. Unlike We, Orwell wasn't very ambitious on touching every aspect of totalitarianism. I don't know how many people noticed the unusually frequent presence of sensual description -- which to me seems like the hidden theme of this book -- but this book is way much more than a construction of dystopia. How do we think at the presence of our body and the presence of politics? How does politics, social norms, nurturing shape our mind? These are generally valid questions that to my knowledge have never been dealt with in a moral-judgement-free way.I'm glad that I shall read this now, with a question in my mind and no (or not that many) pre-set moral judgements."
269,Praveen,"This novel is really a though provoking one, I am not writing review. This is what I felt all across this book.This book was in my “to read” list in No.1 positing for a long time but I was always postponing but now I have done it.In 1948 George Orwell wrote 1984, a novel about a futuristic society where ubiquitous government surveillance is happening on its citizens.Which made me think about the presence of “Closed-circuit television” (CCTV) in our present world.“YES! BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU.""But in present world war is not happening as it’s happened in History. I mean, in history war happened for three reasons :1)Kings and emperors wanted to extend their state and national foundries. 2)And during the era of Industrial Revolution countries wanted to sell their surplus products to other nation and there emerged capitalism and their exercise of power on their nations and their game of 
Machtpolitik
 or Power politics where nations compete for the world's resources and it is to a nation's advantage to be manifestly able to harm others. It prioritizes national self-interest over the interest of other nations or the international community. 3)Wars made in the name of revolution. Like George Orwell wrote in this book 
“Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship.”
 This not the age of monopoly industries and centralized governments. This an age where people are neither a communist nor a liberalist, majority of us are lazy non-voting citizen of the age of LPG (Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization). We are all lost in the crowd people who rushes for their daily bread and accumulation of wealth and who lives the life of keeping apart or life of my own business, who for the sake of killing time involves in criticizing each and every government which comes in to power, just like reading “Page Three” of new paper. Hush… now a day more or less all the pages in newspaper is becoming “Page Three”, they prefer to discuss the trends of Paris Hilton’s inner wear than the encroachment in national frontiers.At times I feel everyone are communist, a variety of different forms of communism has developed, each based on the ideas of different political theorists. The case which I said is “Pure Communism”; for an example whenever there is a raise in the price of petrol/ diesel/ kerosene/ cooking gas or regardless of working hard our manager gives us a lousy bonus, we feel it unfair and want to protest but we never do, we bury it deep inside our unconscious mind. The zest of communism is the sense of revolution or protest against the decision-making process in both political and economical sphere of our life, where interest of every member of society is not given equal consideration.“If you are a communist you view the world as communist.” "
270,Ploy Julintron ,"1984 was not what i was expecting! with being one of the most mention books today the phase ""big brother is watching you"" has away stuck with me. i didn't expect romance in this book at all and for it to be quite a big part of the book. (for me it was)i loved the book and how scary it was, it comes to show how easily society can be manipulated by propaganda and the media.""WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH""i also found a lot of similarity to George Orwell's terrifying world to that of Stalin's Russia. "
271,Sandown Public,"I have heard so many terrific things about this classic novel, it 19s not even funny. Even people who don 19t normally read have recommended this book to me with incredible enthusiasm. For me, this has always been one of those books that you hear people reference a lot but you only have a vague idea of what it 19s about.But OH MY GOODNESS, I am so happy that I finally got around to reading this book!Everything about this book was fantastic. Everything: the characters, the plot, the fascinating world that Orwell created, and on and on. This both had two things I really love in literature: an engaging and captivating story and components that will make you think hard and see things from a new perspective.Let 19s start with the story itself. Winston is an excellent narrator for this story because he is very easy to relate to. He feels as though he is an outsider in a regimented but chaotic world where everyone else fits in. And don 19t we all feel that way sometimes? Standing on our tiptoes at the edge of a crowd, stretching and reaching for a way to make it to the middle. It 19s Winston 19s flaws and desires that make him seem so much more human than his peers, and that 19s precisely why I found I could relate to him despite the utterly different world he lives in. His relationship with Julia was executed extremely well. It was refreshingly realistic, even considering their unfortunate situation. It was not perfect in a romantic sense, but how could it be when nothing in their society was? They made do with what they had and with the circumstances they were forced to live under, just as people do in real life.In a strange way, I really loved the ending of this novel. I won 19t go into detail about it, for obviously spoiler-y reasons, but I will say that is isn 19t happy. But with a story like this, could there ever be a true happy ending? Of course not, not if Orwell wished to maintain any semblance of realistic and logical progression of the plot. The conclusion, while heart-wrenching and not at all pleasant to read, is blatantly honest. Orwell isn 19t trying to make the reader smile- he 19s trying to send the reader a message, to teach the reader a lesson. When I say I love the ending of this novel it 19s not because of the way it happens, but rather the fact that it does happen, if that makes any sort of sense. I appreciate the honesty and frankness which with Orwell tells this story, and it is these specific qualities that I love.The entire concept of this novel was extraordinarily fascinating. The fact that Orwell set this book only four decades in the future from when he wrote it says a lot about the state he thought the world was in at the time. Of course, his view is most likely exaggerated in the extreme setting of the novel, but the underlying implications still exist. Also, looking at this novel from a modern-day perspective is also incredibly interesting. Many aspects of the society of 1984 are relevant today, such as the way we often choose to ignore the poverty that is plaguing much of the globe. Although it was written over half a century ago, there are nevertheless several connections to be made between Winston 19s world and ours.Overall, 1984 was just as amazing as everyone promised me it would be. It evoked emotion while simultaneously promoting thought, which is my favorite type of story. If you have never read anything by George Orwell, this novel is a great place to start!My Rating: :0) :0) :0) :0) :0) 5 out of 5 smileysWould I recommend it to a friend?: Absolutely!Yours,HOLLYhttp://nutfreenerd.wordpress.com/2014..."
272,Evangelos Sotiris,"Για να κατανοήσει κανείς το βιβλίο αυτό, πρέπει κατά τη γνώμη μου, να συνδυάσει την ανάγνωσή του με αυτήν του ""Θαυμαστός καινούριος κόσμος"". Στο 1984 η εξουσία επιβάλλεται δια της βίας με όλα τα στοιχεία που χαρακτηρίζουν ένα ολοκληρωτικό καθεστώς. Στο Brave new World η εξουσία είναι ελκυστική μέσω ναρκωτικών και εμπορευματοποίησης της καθημερινότητας. Καταλήγει κανείς στο αβίαστο συμπέρασμα, ότι βιώνουμε έναν συνδυασμό των δύο αυτών προφητικών βιβλίων."

274,Ahmed,"The book really describes our modern day in which people are spied on all the time. There is no way one can escape it. In Facebook, twitter, email, whatsapp…etc one is spied on. The same thing Orwell describes in his book where the telescreen plays the role of spying. The Party (Insog/The Big Brother) controls Oceania and its people. No one knows the past because it is destroyed by the authorities of The Party. Everyone believes what the Party says to the degree if one doesn't believe that (2+2=5), one will be tortured till he/she admits that 2+2=5. Winston Smith hates The Party and wants to defeat IT because the Party is not fair. One day, He sees a man named O'Brien and thinks that this man is on his side against the Party. Without clear evidence supports his thought Winston goes to O'Brien and tells him how much he hates the Party and wants to defeats it by joining the Brotherhood. The brotherhood is a party opposite to The Party (Insog/The Big Brother) which nobody knows for real of its real existence or not. Unfortunately, O'Brien is 100% with The Party (Insog/The Big Brother). O'Brien catches Winston several days later and tortures and conditions him till Winston begins loving the Big Brother and the Party.The language is so ironical in 1984. Orwell always fascinates me with his ironical language. "

277,Graysen Morency,"George Orwell’s 1984 is a true gem, not because of the story line or the characters, though Winston and his suffering within the totalitarian regime of Oceana should not be discounted. The true value of 1984 is its statements on socialism, human nature, and the dangers of any kind of absolutism. A world enveloped in thought-control, ruled by ignorance and suppression of non-conformity. The idea that a world built out of the rejection of the “Capitalist Oligarchy” would become more corrupt and oppressive than prior says something about Orwell’s perspectives on the dangers of Communism - and the damage it can cause despite seeming to be a political structure for the people. I certainly appreciate the book more as a political novel than a tale of suffering, the ideas behind the country are so eloquently crafted that they are a book of their own. Diverse and filled with much to explore and analyze, I felt like I was reading an easy-to-digest philosophy essay. That may sound boring, but it is quite the contrary. Totally recommend to the political/philosophy nerds."

280,Rob Walter,"I hadn't read this book since I was in high school, more than 15 years ago, so I was basically coming to it totally fresh. What struck me wasn't the quality of the political ideas, but the insight into the human condition. It's difficult to delve too deeply into it without giving away important elements of the plot, but deeply examining the motivations of each character yields an unexpected degree of subtlety and considerable material for introspection.Human beings are social creatures and thus we do act collectively. To read this novel only as an indictment of collectivism is to miss the more personal and powerful point on offer, which is that we each must decide how to balance our social and individualistic motivations. Sensuality and desire are inherently individualistic, but doesn't Winston also act out of a need to feel connected with his past, present and future community? And how should we feel about Julia's hedonism?There is so much in this book to engage with and I would highly recommend a reread to anyone who hasn't read it since their youth."

282,Evan Protsman,"""Winston Smith takes it on the Jaw,” That is the name of a song by the band Utopia, which is written about George Orwell’s masterpiece of dystopian fiction 1984.The book 1984 by George Orwell takes place in a dystopian future of London, England. London (part of Oceania) is under the rule of a totalitarian government. The year is 1984, but no one is exactly sure. Big Brother is supposedly the leader of the Party (the name of the government). The land of Oceania is under strict rule, and is always at war with either Eastasia or Eurasia. 	Winston Smith is the main character of the book, and works in the Ministry of Truth where he alters history as the Party sees fit. Winston is very frail and intellectual with no definable traits that would set him apart from others. Like everyone else in the nation of Oceania, Winston is constantly watched and monitored through telescreens and hidden microphones. If you have committed an act, or thought of committing an act, of rebellion against the Party the thought police would take you away. Even though the thought police are constantly watching, Winston still rebels against the party in various small ways, like owning a diary.	Winston met O’Brien at work, and believed they had a lot in common. O’Brien is a high-ranking Party member who Winston believes is mysterious. Winston also meets Julia, who he hated and thought would turn him into the thought police. Julia is a mechanic of sorts that works in the Fiction department of the Ministry of Truth, and has been in love with Winston. Julia is able to tell Winston of her feelings through a note. They begin seeing each other. Julia is also has the same feelings as Winston about the party, except she is younger and more rebellious. Julia is a good actor and can blend into the crowd, which is necessary to cover up her rebellious nature. Winston and Julia were happy for months, and even acquired a house. However, their happiness will not last. SPOILER ALERT (stop here if you don’t want spoilers)	One day O’Brien invites Winston and Julia to his house. Winston had expected it to be something about the Brotherhood, the secret organization that opposes the Party, and he was right. O’Brien had called for Winston and Julia because he suspected that they were rebels, and that the Brotherhood needed them. Winston and Julia accepted, and swore their life to the Brotherhood. Later, Winston received the book of the Brotherhood, written by Goldstein the creator of the secret organization.	After a few days, Winston and Julia were reading the book when the thought police suddenly arrested them. The thought police separated Winston and Julia. They took Winston to the Ministry of Love where they tortured him for years forcing him to love Big Brother, and accept the Party’s ideas. They had physically and mentally broken him down, and then built him back up the way they wanted. The torturers had gotten him to accept the party’s ideas, but Winston still did not love Big Brother and he still loved Julia. So, they took him to room 101. Room 101 is where they make you face your worst fears, for Winston it was rats. The torturers put him in a cage of rats, but before they could do anything Winston told them to do it to Julia and not him. Winston was finally broken, and he was never the same.	END OF SPOILERS	1984, a dystopian fiction, is a wonderful yet horrific book. I say horrific because of the very descriptive and gore filled scenes. George Orwell masterfully describes Winston’s life from beginning to end. Orwell takes you through a roller coaster of emotions ranging from happiness, sadness, passion, and pity. The ending is expected, although unexpected is appropriate and will leave you satisfied.	My favorite part of this book (more spoilers) is when Winston bought the glass paperweight. This showed how thoughtful and passionate Winston could be, and that his curiosity could not be tamed.	I greatly enjoyed this book, and could read it for hours on end. I would also recommend 1984 to anyone who enjoys dystopian books, or would like to have insight on the scary realization of what our world could have become had World War II gone differently."
283,Mark Jones,"There's a reason classic novels are classics.With George Orwell's 1984, that truth is shown more clearly then ever. Published in 1949, many of the themes are still relevant today, making for a timeless read.1984 is divided up into three parts. You're carried through the first due to your interest in the world of 1984. In this dystopian landscape, totalitarian governments constantly monitor their citizens. Not only do they control their actions through this, but using propaganda and a clipped language of ""newspeak"" even peoples' thoughts can be controlled. Indeed, the government plans to irradicate any unorthodox thought completely by getting rid of any language with which a person can think about or express their discontent.For the second part, the reader is kept engaged through a hidden, developing romance. This is interesting in of itself because, at least in the beginning, the romance is not so much an act of love as an aspect of rebellion against the party. As well, the reader gets to dive a little deeper into the inner workings of the world.The third part, too, is riveting. That however I'll save for the very end, so those of you who haven't read the book won't be spoiled. Just know there are some major plot twists.All in all, 1984 was a fascinating read. It's thoughts on monitoring people and government control were certainly food for thought, and increasingly so in this modern era. I'd certainly recommend it, although it should be said that two friends of mine who read it said at it was quite dull. Since that thoughtless comment I've banished them from my friend group, tortured them, made them agree that it's a great book, murdered them, and burned down their houses. Read the book anyway, people. Both myself and big brother will be watching you.Thanks,-MarkRight! Onto the third part for those of you who've already read the book. Ah, freedom at last!I found part three to be both the worst and best part of the book. Worst because of the rather tragic end and disregard of much of what we thought we knew, best because it was so well done. The slow breakdown of Winston until his eventual complete submission was infuriating to watch. Yet, at the same time, it felt as though it belonged. The party remains almost indestructible, and the world remains bleak; which I think Orwell perhaps wanted to do. He wanted to leave the world a warning.Again, it was a great book. Double thanks to you for reading this far.-Mark"
284,Natasia,"Excellent book, quite quick to read. Very well written. And realistic too. At some point, I had to interrupt my reading for a few minutes because I started to feel unwell. The society described in the novel is scary, and I couldn't help imagining a couple of countries today being very similar to it. I also loved the fact that the writer invented a modern form of English in his story. The appendix even explains the (rather simplistic) vocabulary and grammar. Just read it already!"

287,Maxim,"1984 behoort vanaf heden tot één van mijn favoriete boeken. Orwell zijn literaire stijl is buitengewoon. Hij schrijft zeer helder, maakt gebruik van prachtige metaforen en tovert gebeurtenissen om tot suggestieve en plastische beelden. Dit is echter het puntje van de ijsberg. Het onderwerp van 1984, dat overigens geschreven is in 1949, is nog steeds een actueel en ijzingwekkend thema. Een totalitair regime, gebaseerd op de Nazi's en de USSR, overheerst London. Iedereen die opstand biedt, wordt de kop ingedrukt. Gevaporiseerd. Winston Smith werkt voor de Partij, maar is allesbehalve voorstander van dit soort despotisme. Via slinkse manieren probeert hij verzet te bieden, maar als lezer wordt het je al snel duidelijk dat zijn acties gedoemd zijn om te mislukken. Orwell geeft zijn hoofdpersonage ook flashbacks, wat mij bijzonder intrigeert. Als onoplettende lezer zou je denken dat Winston krankzinnig wordt vanaf deel drie (wanneer ze hem martelen en psychologisch folteren), maar het is mijn mening dat er vanaf het begin al iets aan de hand is met Winston. De beginzin luidt namelijk: ""het was een heldere, koude dag in april, en de klokken sloegen dertien."" Op pagina 99 echter vind ik de volgende zin terug: ""Toch had hij, voorzover hij zich kon herinneren, NOOIT kerkklokken horen luiden."" Dit suggereert dat Winston al bij de start van het boek kenmerken van krankzinnigheid of hallucinaties vertoont, wat een heel andere insteek geeft op de gebeurtenissen. Hiernaast biedt het einde twee verschillende interpretaties: Winston blijft leven, maar is geautomatiseerd tot een voorstander van de Partij, of Winston wordt geëlimineerd door de Partij. Hoe dan ook, dit boek laat een sterke indruk achter. Impressionant. "
288,Elizabetha,"Ya es hora que lo lea, esta pendiente desde agosto del 2010.****
¡¡¡Hoy no he podido leer nada!!! ...quedé tan impresionada con las últimas 100 hojas que de sólo recordarlas siento una sensación de angustia horrible que me impide retomar otros libros más ""amistosos""... y lo peor es pensar que cosas así sucedieron y siguen sucediendo...Es un relato descarnada y temo que verídico de la condición humana.
 Cuando pase un poco la impresión, en un par de días haré la reseña. 
 Algunas ideas sueltas 
Ninguna novela de terror ha hecho temblar y leer tan compulsivamente como ésta. Quería dejar el libro a cada momento,pero me atraía morbosamente...hasta que la angustia y la sensación de miedo se hicieron insoportables en la última página. Al cerrarlo me invadió una sensación de descanso, de gratitud por no experimentar una vida como esa...pero el espanto subsistió...Y pensar que me pasé un semestre estudiando un tema a fin (el Terror en los régimen totalitario de la Rusia Soviética, especialmente las Grandes Purgas) con una aséptica visión de laboratorio y al leer 1984, de pronto todo ese conocimiento se me metió en las venas, al casi vivir la historia de Wiston Smith en carne propia, de identificarme con él.La narración es magnifica, pues logra certeramente comunicarte y conectarte con los personajes de esta aterradora manera.Realmente un libro NOTABLE, que nadie debe dejar de leer aunque espante. A pasar de ser espeluznante.De que por momentos te ahoga y te deja sin esperanza alguna. No sé si podré leerlo nuevamente... ignoro si soportaría experimentar nuevamente esta historia.Orwell es un gran escritor, un profundo ensayista...un genio.5/5 estrellas7/7 Castillos ....NOTABLE"

293,Vj Solinap,"THIS IS, BY FAR, THE MOST DISTURBING BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ.Beginning from the first sentence, Orwell has introduced me to Winston Smith's world I have never before imagined would exist. It is in this book that I ever knew that man is capable of creating such evil to the point of erasing the thing that makes it human. It is in this book that I have learned that selfishness is capable of forgetting one's feelings towards one another like love. To think that love is a powerful feeling! We can't also deny the fact that probably, just probably, in a decade, in 50 years, a century, all of this would soon be a reality. We never know, that it's probably in the works by now. Ok so I still have a lot of thoughts towards this book but I can't seem to put it all in words. All in all, from the first sentence to the last, George Orwell created a world, created an atmosphere in my head and unlike all the books that I've read before, this one made the words come out of the pages because everything seemed so real. Just... I don't know. This work is a masterpiece *ugly sobs*"
294,Mahmoud Tharwat,"Probably Orwell wrote this novel for a future that he didn't want to exist  . It is a message more than a novel. and may some of it became real in these days ""the best books are those that tell you what you know already"" Winston perceiving while reading ""the book"".after  a revolution in your country this book will be more celebrated than befor because you knew already what is going to be said in this book and you just need one to express your feelings as Orwell did . in every country we see Winston , we see Julia , the telescreen , the speakwrite ., the big brother and we see the proles -- "" if there was a hope , it lay in the proles"".. although it is right but we should fear the proles as well when the power and the influence of the regime is so high that the proles them selves fear it as we saw in the story of the chinless man and the skull-face man.we see the big brother . Big brother is the guise  in which the party choose to exhibit itself to the world .His function is to act as a focusing point for love, fear and reverence, emotions which are morally easily  felt toward an individual than toward an organisation . Applying this to Egypt , we could see that the organization is the Military Council and the individual -""the Big Brother""- is SisiFrom darker point of view , what if The telescreen is our smart phones cameras ? what if The Speakwrite is Google now or Siri ? maybe Evernote or Facebook is The memory hole ?!of course we know that google take all our secrets and our private life! maybe thay made an engine to predict what we are going to think based on our previous serches ? isn't that make Google the real Thought Police ? what about that The Big Brother is the US and it is watching us now ?! and our countries leaders is little ""Big Brothers"" or inner party members !On that topic Orwell says, ""  the invention of print ,however, made it easier to manipulate public opinion ,and the film and the radio carried the process further . With the development of television , and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end . every citizen or at least every citizen important to be worth watching could be kept for 24 hour a day under the eyes of the police and on the sound of a official propaganda, with all of other channels of communication closed , the possibility of enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the state , but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects , now exist for the first time. Quotes* If you want a picture of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human face -- forever* No one ever sizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. power is not a means, it is an end . one does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution ; one makes a the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship . * Who controls the past controls the future : who controls the present controls the past * nothing in the world was so bad as  physical pain ... in the face of pain there are no heroes... no heroes * For long periods the high seem to be securely in power but sooner or later there always comes a moment when the lose either their belief in themselves or their capecity to govern efficiently or both . They are  then overthrown by the middle who enlist the low on this side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached the objective the middle thrust the low back into their old position of servitude , and themselves become the high. presently a new Middle group splits off from one of the other groups or from both of them and them ,and the struggles begins over again . Of the three groups only the low are never even temporarily successful in achieving that aims . it would be an exaggeration to say the throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind . * In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to the state of war . it does not matter whether the war is actually happening , and,  since no decisive victory is possible , it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly. all that is needed this is that a state of war should exist . * Any country which remained industrially backward  was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated directly or indirectly by its more advanced rivals * The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because its not an organization the ordinary sense,  nothing hold it together except an idea which is indestructible * The rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the government of Oceania itself just to keep people frightened * The tales about Goldstein and his underground army  were simply a lot of rubbish which the party had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in * The clever thing was to break the rules and stay alive all the same"
295,Dimitris Hall,"Under the spreading chestnut treeI sold you and you sold meThere lie they, and here lie weUnder the spreading chestnut treeI always loved how, in the book, pop prolefeed songs are manufactured by computers; no human creativity is needed. I involuntarily recall this tidbit whenever I listen to the newest radio hit these days. I originally read Nineteen Eighty-Four (the original title, though understandably usually shortened to 1984) in Greek a few years back. 10 days or so ago I felt a need to return to it in English and did so in audio book format, read by Simon Prebble.They say that Brave New World describes our world much better than 1984 does, that the blissful ignorance is much more prominent in our society than 1984's ""boot stamping the human face"". I've always held at heart that our own dystopia in the making is the neat blend of the two: the blissfully ignorant sex, drugs and genetically determined human strata, go hand in hand with a government that is in love with power and has merely chosen this more subdued but no less effective way to prolong its ever-lasting dominion.In this world, wars never end; the enemy is unbeatable and ever-present. Bombs go off randomly every now and again just to allow your mind to come in terms with this fact. Telescreens follow the population everywhere. Nowadays people even take little telescreens with them and have feelings of withdrawal if they are ever separated from them. Those who control the present control the past, and those who do so, do it very, very well. So well, in fact, that public opinion can be swayed one way or another in a matter of weeks or even days -- so little do people actually remember, so easily do they forget. Relativism is used as the end-all be-all argument to support that might is right following sickening twists of logic: that there is no nature ""out there"", thus truth is dictated by the government and the government only. A similar argument hides behind the saying ""who wants to ban fascist groups is against freedom of speech and a fascist themselves!"" The encouragement of doublethink, of which the above is but an example, ultimately has people holding two contradicting beliefs at the same time: ""I'm not a racist, but everybody knows that our race is more advanced"" or ""war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength"". In a similar vain, the government body that is responsible for hitting people and quenching peaceful protests is named ""Ministry of Citizen Protection"" and the one which makes sure that everyone starves is called ""Ministry of Development"", releasing false figures to mask the facts and manipulate the masses. They are allowed to do so; there are no real laws, since the judiciary body is also controlled by the government. What about the proles where the hope for revolution lies? They're either too busy surviving to actually think for themselves or they're blindly consuming the ""prolefeed"" the party is providing them with, including of course their own propaganda. ...oh, sorry about that. I got carried away there and started describing our own living, breathing 2012.This is definitely one of the masterpieces of the 20th century and is one of absolute favourites. It stands as a beaming symbol of the totalitarian societies of the past and of political oppression, violence, propaganda, hunger for power etc. Orwell's vision was so ironically vivid, realistic and reverberated with so many that his name has even come through this book to stand for a whole arrangement of things that smack of real-world totalitarianism. Even if he did write it for a different world than what exists more than half a century later, it's evident that when it comes to human societies, old loves die hard; whether it is totalitarian socialism/communism or hardcore neo-liberal capitalism, it makes little difference. The essence, displays Orwell masterfully, remains the same. Reading 1984, especially for a second time, I got the same feeling Winston, the protagonist, gets from reading a certain book in the book itself: that he had always known about these things and that he was grateful that he had found someone who could articulate them for him.Parts of 1984 are extreme, I'll admit. Part Three is a punch in the gut every time. I just wanted to lie in a fetal position in the corner of my room after first reading it. It is that hopeless, that horrible. I can't believe that states like Oceania et al. could be set up and maintain themselves on force, pain and hatred alone; call it conscience, call it a belief that people are basically good, I just can't see such a place existing. It's too evil to exist! That said, I can't think of a way that such a regime, if already having been set up properly, could fall, either. Not to mention that in many ways, our own world and reality is full of unnecessary evil. Who's to say if it's within the bounds of possibility for the next logical step in this progression of evil and imbalance to be taken?This nightmarish inevitability hidden within, the terror of the idea that if someone really wanted to create IngSoc and Oceania, he could, is what plays with my mind and I believe with every reader's mind. We might, like Winston, think that such a world is just a work of dystopian fantasy; if we look around us carefully, we just might realise that the absoluteness of the pain, the torture and the future being described as ""a boot stamping on a human face forever"" might not be such absurd ideas after all.The owner of the boot is creating his shoelaces made of hatred and fear as we speak. What if we could create our own artificial shortage of shoelaces?"

297,Brian Whittaker,"Brilliant - creepy, dark, engaging and very thought-provoking. I have never been moved by a novel as much as this one. "
298,Angela,"My all-time favourite novel. I've lost count how many times I've read this (and judging from my book lists, it's well overdue another reread). I know it's grim and depressing, that doesn't stop me from reading it or from going to watch it in the theatre (5 times, 3 different productions) and watching the film. Little background story for you. I first heard about this book when I was about 12 years old. The high school I attended had a seperate section of books which the Sixth Formers could take out. This was in that section. I asked my school librarian if I could borrow it and she said I was too young and wouldn't understand it. I thought ""BITCH! Who the hell is she to dictate to me what I can and cannot read?!"" So, I saved up my weekly pocket money (which was about £2/£3) and when I had enough I went to the bookstore in town after school and purchased a copy. I read this novel over the course of that weekend, taking notes to relay to the school librarian. On Monday morning, I told the librarian that I had bought and read '1984' and gave her my notes. She looked at them and said ""Oh, you did understand it"". I then asked her if I'd proven myself to be able to take out the Sixth Form books (I now wanted to read 'Brave New World') and she said I was too young and wouldn't understand them. From that day on, I started using the public libraries a hell of a lot more, and if I had any problems taking out books, my mother would insist that I was allowed to read what I wanted.*UPDATE* Re-read this novel as it had been a good few years since I last picked it up. There's a reason why this is my all-time favourite novel; it has everything I want in a work of literature, not to mention it's bloody terrifying. "
299,Somerandom,"Okay, this book quite literally terrified me. I mean I was upset for the peeps in Hunger Games and the like, but holy hell this book hit me like a ton of bricks.(Now it should be noted that I never mentioned Hunger Games at all. Why would I? Nope, never did I ever type such a thing!)Winston isn't particularly memorable, but perhaps that's kind of the point. He is just another drone from sector 7B (whoops, wrong reference) I mean a worker for the Party, an outer Party member, if you will. Who goes to painstaking lengths to appear like a grey conformist blob with no discernible personality other than he thinks he's crazy for going against the grain.The world of Oceania is really the main character and what a main character it is. Hypocritical, all knowing, self aware, vindictive, hate filled, power hungry, desolate and destructive. It tears at the very essence of humanity with ease and with the precision of a freaking surgeon. It was horrifying. The prose is usual (or I'd imagine it's usual, but this is only my second helping) Orwell. Sort of matter of fact. Like a lecturer telling you a cautionary tale. The ideas presented, whilst seeming to be a sort of mockery, has grains of truth to them and lead to disastrous consequences. The world of 1984 is not only terrifying because of it's deeds, but for what they stand for and what they hope to achieve (and succeed.) It's terrifying in an existential way, in a way that is hopeless and crushing. A true essential Dystopian. Now I'm going to cut this review out here, before the Thought Police can get me. "
300,Maddie,https://enchantingpages.wordpress.com...
301,Javier,"Thought-provoking.The main character, Winston Smith, lives in a totalitarian society in which there's no privacy and every movement (even every facial gesture) is controlled with telescreens (TV + camera) and microphones. Whenever a citizen expresses discontent towards the government (embodied by the mysterious figure of Big Brother), he gets arrested and ""vaporized"" (he gets killed and all records of his life are erased, so it is as if he never existed). Anyway, this character thinks that the system is wrong and at the beginning of the book he starts writing a diary expressing his discrepancies with Big Brother. He knows that if someone finds the diary, he'll be vaporized.The story of this character is interesting. However, what I find really interesting is the setting itself. Right from the beginning, you get to know the slogans of the party. The first time I read them, I tried to figure their meaning out unsuccessfully, but they got explained later. At some point of the story, Winston gets a book where the whole system he's living in is explained. When he starts reading it, the book changes its style completely and suddenly, you find yourself in front of a very interesting and profound essay about politics (and I'm serious).There are many things and definitions that got my attention: the concept of doublethink, the mutability of the past, the names of the ministries, the new official language... This last one is pretty interesting. At the time Winston's story takes place, his society is in the process of changing the official language from English to Newspeak. Newspeak is a language based on English, but utterly different. Its purpose is to limit the options of its speakers in a way that they can't think against Big Brother. For example, one of the peculiarities of Newspeak is that the vocabulary is utterly reduced, so you have less options to express your thoughts. In addition to this, every word has only one meaning. In the end, you get a language in which you can say sentences which are correct syntactically but are absurdities. An example of this would be the sentence ""all mans are equal"" (mans = men). This sentence in Newspeak - while being syntactically correct - it is as absurd as saying ""all men are redhaired"", because ""equal"" in Newspeak means equal in size, height, weight and many other things, not only ""equal in rights"" (in fact, such a term cannot be formulated in Newspeak). There are many more details about it that you can find in the appendix of the book. As soon as the first reference to Newspeak appeared on the story, I read the entire appendix and I enjoyed it very much.As a final note, I must say that this book is really dark and some people might find it a bit disturbing. The book (specially towards the end) gets a bit violent and savage. There are also some sexual scenes that could be argued as necessary for the story, but they could have been hinted in a subtler way. And finally, in my opinion, 1984 should be thought-provoking, so take it only if that's what you want."

304,Mark King,A book that sets the tone for all similar books to follow. A truly chilling tale of how the future is slowly panning out. The only fault is with the title as 2024 may be nearer the time when its tale will come true. We are all sleep-walking into a world were privacy is no longer a guarantee against control from others.

306,Chris Cruz," Book Review: 1984 by George Orwell (Read at your own risk, Spoliers might appear)  War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strenght  It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen………………..  For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was h writing this diary? For the future, for the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeak word doublethink. For the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? It was of its nature impossible. Either the future would resemble the present in which case it would not listen to him, or it would be different from it, and his predicament would be meaningless.  Thouthcrime does not entail death, thougthcrime is death.  Altering the Past, As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of the Times and pushed them into pneumatic tube. Then, with a movement which was as nearly as possible  uncounsious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had made, and dropped them into  the memory hole to be devoured by the flames. What happen in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms. As soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of the Times had been assembled and collated, that number would be reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead. This process of continous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound tracks, cartoon, photographs, to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance. Day by Day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. In thi way every prediction  made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct.  Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thought crime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever be  needed will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meaning rubbed  out and forgotten.  Has it occurred to you Winston, that by year 2050 at the very latest, not a single human being will be alive who  could understand such a conversation as we are having now? The alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons, one of which is subsidiary and so, so to speak, precautionary The subsidiary reason is that the Party member, like the proletarian, tolerates present-day conditions partly because he has no standard of comparison. He must be cut off from the past, just as he must be cut off from foreign countries because it is necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestor and that the average level of  material comfort is constantly rising.  Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one’s mind simultaneously, and accepting Both of them.  Dark, depressing, this is how I will describe this great work of Eric Blair aka George Orwell. This is one of the best and on on the top of the list among the dystopian novel that had been written and published. Many are still amaze on how Orwell Orwell describe in details on how liberty, freedom were totally wipe out in this fictional novel. The masses exist to serve state aka Big Brother. Opposition were not totally wipe out and anyone caught thinking or in the act of rebellion will dealt by the State. For how can they revolt when all the means to revolt were totally wipe out the government and all the  infrastructure of the society were use not to benefit the masses but to enslave them and spy on them. Privacy has no place in the society. Where independent though and thinking are not allowed and all must have the same thinking. The masses  only exist at the pleasure and whim of the Big Brother. Truly this book will really make you cry and pity the main character Winston Smith who tried to rebelled against the Big Brother but he was not successful and the worst he was tortured and brainwash and he finally submitted and love Big Brother in the end of the story. You been people, let us not allowed our  freedom and liberty to be taken from us.  Christopher Cruz, February 16, 2014 "

Apart from the fact that I really loved the way the author wrote an imaginative world(not far long) and its story line, I was really scared at how much he could be right about our future. The intolerance and justification of ""proper living"" may wreck havoc on humanity and to believe that it might happen in our future really freaked me out. It maybe one of the most mind blowing and scariest book I've ever read. I never understood the popularity behind this book. But now I got it. We need to wake up and take it as a warning. "

310,Ambar Parashar,Few books make you think beyond the horizon. A book which will surely let us know difference between utopian and dystopian society. Psychological thriller to some extent. 
311,Jasmine,"I decided to read 1984 at the very beginning of the summer. When I finally got it, it was the fastest book I read this summer. I loved the main character, Winston, and how he broke the harsh rules of his society even when monitored onscreen almost 24/7. It almost made it seem like a spy or undercover operation, with the punishment for failure was your own brain (literally and/or figuratively). Maybe I'm just someone who would like this type of book regardless, but I have to say that 1984 sends a huge message to our current world and our own ever changing society. Sure some of it might have gone too far and was a bit unrealistic, but I think that Orwell went over the top on purpose. He wanted to show society as a living, breathing thing with infinite power. The ruling class, called the Party, controls every aspect of truth telling. This is demonstrated by Winston's work rewriting records and articles to twist the past in favor of the Party. History is manipulated closely so no one can gather evidence about the Party's hypocritical actions. This ability to accept two different contradicting ideas is what is known as 'doublethink'. The people are expected to accept the illogical ""facts"" when the truth is obvious. The concept of doublethink is as crazy as it gets. However, society will change and who knows what will happen in the future. Even though 1984 is past, Orwell's vision of a nightmarish world keep 1984 one of the best books ever read. Even though you might not like the story, keep in mind that you have the ability to voice your own opinions. In the future, the ones in power might say that 2+2=5 and you WILL accept it."
312,Myron,"After having read Animal Farm it was clear Orwell was disappointed with the way Communism had eventuated in Russia. 1984, to me, is Animal Farm projected into the future where Orwell discusses what life would be like if this form of Communism/Socialism had taken over the world. As expected, he paints a bleak future.The book begins by throwing the reader into Winston Smith's life in 1984 London where the Party has created a dystopia. Orwell takes the reader through Smith's thoughts, feelings, emotions and actions as he attempts to avoid the Thought Police while keeping his sanity. Big Brother is watching.As a read the book is well paced throughout except for small patches in Part Two where things slow down a lot. Nevertheless after Part Two things really pick up and the book becomes very brutal, rewarding the reader for having gotten through the difficult parts of the book. The plot of 1984 has you questioning whether this kind of dystopia is possible and whether Winston is making the right decisions. There are many elements of 1984 that have been seen in dictatorships today, however other areas are too unfeasible. The idea that all proles will never make a noise, especially when rockets are landing amongst them is not very realistic. Nevertheless the plot is entertaining and thought provoking.Smith is made to be a very sympathetic character to the reader due to the situation he is put in. However for me personally, whenever he has problems they can usually be traced back to his own bad decisions. This does not take away from the plot though, it is an understandable character flaw.Still, with these small issues 1984 is a great book to read and, as long as it is not taken too seriously, will be very entertaining. "
313,Saurabh Goyal,"The meaning of some books is over-interpreted and over-determined. 1984 by George Orwell is one such book. What new can be said about the book that has not been said already? I have two takeaways.First, the book peels off layer by layer the deep paradox of modernity. On one hand, we aspire for a world of individuality, liberty and self-affirmation. On the other, the modern institutions like state, capitalism, socialism, nation etc. make the individual look insignificant. It is as if the individual does have free-will so long as he wills the pre-determined choices for him. Winston, the protagonist in the book, has a mutiny in his heart and mind. But in the face of overwhelming harsh reality outside, the mutiny loses all steam and hope. Second is the profound questions, do we really know our own selves? Are our feelings, emotions, love, hate and culture our own or is it all shaped outside of us? Is our individual nature original or second-handed? The book does not answer these questions. But it leaves you with them to meditate on. The most horrifyingly tragic part of the book was when the “Party” makes Winston and Julia, two lovers, give up on each other. It is not the adversity that breaks a person down; we all encounter some in one form or another. But it is rather the idea that the world can be so harsh that it will take away your power to deal with the adversity on your own terms. That it will deny you even a dignified struggle to redemption. And when that happens life loses all meaning; desires and dreams lose their motivating sheen; resentment and outrage seem futile constructs in a world without a hope of justice. And that is how party break down the rebels. It corrodes the most intimate and most sacred part of one’s self. I happened to read this book at a time when A Dalit student in Hyderabad University, Rohith Vemula, committed suicide. His extraordinarily profound and moving suicide note touches the very themes that 1984 is about. Rohith’s letter was calmly indignant at a world which denies individuality, at Indian society which dehumanizes the marginalized and dispossessed, at moral vocabulary which is more an illusion than a concrete reality, and at humanity caught up in petty power struggles, forgetting stars, nature and idealism.Both 1984 and Rohith’s letter are deeply discomforting. They challenge our easy and lazy ideas about life. They leave you with few answers and great questions. If the purpose of writing is to evoke thinking rather than give instructions, both these writings score full marks."
314,Himal Kotelawala,"Read this 15 years ago. Depressed the hell out of me. Fantastic book, but not something I'd pick up for a second time."
315,Devon,"Devon LaufferMrs. CarteauxEnglish One Honors Period C19 September2014SPOILERS1984 Book Analysis	George Orwell’s critically acclaimed book 1984 is a master piece about a future 90 percent of the world are like mindless sheep, believing whatever they’re told. If any sign of intelligence is spotted, the person is “removed”. The protagonist, Winston, is trying to survive in this world full of dictators. 1984 is full of ideas about human nature, the human mind, and the meaning of life. However, the main theme is ""this is what the future will look like if humans don’t change their ways."" 1984 is a great novel with its ideas and story, but is incredibly grim, dark, and it definitely doesn’t a happy ending. 	Every day, Winston goes to work and revises history to make Big Brother (a dictator who is actual the upper class) seem genius and compassionate. There, he falls in love with Julia, another worker. Love is strictly forbidden, unless it is a love of Big Brother. In order to get married, Winston and Julia join a secret organization called the Brotherhood, which is devoted to killing Big Brother. After receiving a book with all of the Brotherhood’s ideals, Winston and Julia are caught. As it turns out, the Brotherhood is just a way to catch people that are against Big Brother. Over the course of time, Winston and Julia are tortured and tortured until, through mental warfare, they are both brainwashed into loving Big Brother. In fact, Winston’s last thought was “But it was alright, everything was alright, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother,” (Orwell 298). 	1984 is easily a classic like George Orwell’s Animal Farm, but like Animal Farm, it doesn’t sugar coat anything. It continuously shows the bad side of human nature and how future like this might have happened, though it is incredibly unlikely. 1984 is ultimately a great mind-bending book with a large touch of reality. "
316,Ash,"This is one of those books that everyone has read and is spoken a lot about. One of the main reasons why I liked this book was that it was very thought provoking. I would say more than the story, I loved the way Orwell has tried to put across a nice social message. It was very disturbing, no doubt. At some point, I was really thinking whether I should skip the torture part. But I still continued because of the way it was written. I had hoped against all hopes that something good or miraculous might happen at the end. But the ending came in as a shock. The last line shook me completely. This is about a government, much worse than any. Very scary and totally unimaginable. ""Power is not a means, it is an end"" being the motive. Sometimes while reading I forgot that this was fictitious because of the way in which he goes into details. He completely justifies why such a party came into existence or why they are the way they are. Even their slogans make lot of sense when you understand what they mean. I usually don't like books which preach or talk about politics or society but this book really impressed me.  This is probably the most disturbing and depressing book I have read so far.My Favs:"" War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength"" ""Who controls the past, controls the future: who controls the present controls the past""""History has stopped""""Nothing exists except through human consciousness""""Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing""""Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to attain""MUST READ Updated: I watched the movie recently and it was even more disturbing to actually see all the torture. But it stuck to the book completely. A very nice adaptation of the book."
317,Kay Coughlin,Brilliant commentary on the fragility of privacy in the shadow of a massive political movement. Many of the issues in the story are entirely too relevant in America today. That a political party might exist unapologetically solely for the perpetuation of its own power is a concept that is playing out even now (though today it is still cloaked in the guise of being for the benefit of the people). Individual rights must be protected at all costs - for who among us has the individual influence to stand against Big Brother?
318,Naman Bansal,"This book beautifully portrays a dystopian world and shows the thirst for power that party has. And the most beautiful part, if you want to control the reality, control the past and thoughts of people. Then reality only exists in their own mind, not outside.This book is worth reading over and over again."
319,Lynn,THINK: it is not illegal yet.
320,Taylor Findlay,"WOW. WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW. I am stunned that I have never picked this up before. I read Animal Farm a long time ago and it still remains to be one of my favourite books of all time, and a book that really taught me something about society. Now, Animal Farm will always be a little better in my eyes, but 1984 blew me away.I'm not going to get into spoilers or anything of the sort, but 1984 really got me thinking, and I love when a book can do that. I found myself questioning my own society, and the similarities between my real-life society and this dystopian society. The sad part of it was, I didn't see too many differences. While our society may not be as out loud about the tricks and trades the government has over us, it is still there.George Orwell got me thinking and shocked me at every page turn. Easily a 5/5 stars here, no question."
321,Şeyma,"anlatmakla, yorumlamakla olmaz alın okuyun. yok böyle bi kitap..."
322,Gail Tilton,"I first read this back in the early 1970s for a college history class called ""Science Fiction as Social Criticism"", and liked it a lot. It gained renewed interest in 1984, but I don't remember reading it again at that time. Now 66 years after it was written and 27 years since 1984, it's quite fascinating reading in the context of current world events. If you've never read it, try it. And if you read it a long time ago, read it again. "
323,Lucy,"Let me tell you a story: we had three different English teachers when I was in year 11, because they kept leaving. This was the last book assigned to us by the second of those teachers. One day, after we were finally finished with Empire Of The Sun (which was unanimously hated), our teacher took us into the storage room so we could pick a book WE wanted to study. The instant we saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, opinion was once again unanimous. But our teacher thought that was too young for our age group and decided she'd pick a book herself, obviously not realising that 16 year olds are MUCH more likely to do their homework if it's a book they WANT TO READ IN THE FIRST PLACE. But I digress. This was the book our teacher chose for us.She chose it because it was her favourite, and her replacement considered it a favourite as well. My class was one of those ones where no matter what book was picked, everyone except for one person hated it. I was that one, every time. Lord of the Flies, Macbeth, Hamlet, even the one Geoffrey Robertson book we studied the next year...I enjoyed them all. (Not that I ever finished Lord of the Flies and I suspect I won't like it as much when I do finally re-read it.) Nineteen Eighty-four is no exception.It's been years now since I read it and I can't remember specific details, but it has stuck with me for five years. It was my first ever dystopia, and I'd never read anything even remotely like it, which is probably part of the reason I loved it so much. Despite all my gushing: this is not a hopeful book, or a happy one. The characters are not likeable. It doesn't have a happy ending. But once it's in your head it will never leave, and the longer it sits there the more you realise how brilliant it is. YA dystopias have nothing on Orwell. To this day I have never been more shocked by an ending than I was by this one: the last four small, unbelievably hard-hitting words left me overcome by a kind of crawling, frigid horror of the kind that you usually only feel after waking up in the small hours after a nightmare.This is not the best book I've ever read, or my most favourite. But I can only thank that teacher for assigning this book because I wouldn't have read it otherwise and I would have never had the chance to be blown away by this. I think this may be the book that renewed my faith in reading, as pretentious as that sounds. (I must have read only mediocre books in my early teen years, because I remember not reading as much then as I did when I was small, or as much as I do now.) It's tremendously relevant even today in terms of government, war and censorship - eerily so; or disappointingly, when you consider that obviously nothing much has changed in 66 years - and will remain very very important for a long time. "
324,Rajesh,"A chilling book. Far more terrifying than some of the horror books out there.I have often wondered what goes on in some of the countries under totalitarian governments. This book gave me an answer. It is very readable even though it can be very depressing at times. It is a book which does not celebrate the human spirit, but rather defines its boundaries."
325,Terrol Williams,"One of those books that are incredibly important to read and yet very difficult to get through, in this case because it is so discouraging. Much has been said and written about Orwell's prescience, and the immeasurable cultural influence he has had, to the degree that ""Orwellian"" has become a common adjective. The world Orwell creates is richly imagined enough that reading the book offers a taste of what it must have felt like under the watchful eye of Big Brother.As I read I realized why this was never assigned in any of my English classes through high school and two college degrees in literature. Of course the great value of this book isn't literary, it's cultural and political. And the most alarming part of Orwell's ""prophetic vision"" isn't that we have little or no privacy today (true as it may be), but that privacy hasn't been taken from is, it has been voluntarily surrendered. Contemporary culture rushes forward and flings privacy on the altar of external validation, whether on reality television, blogs, twitter, or, most ubiquitously, Facebook (of which I am a relatively active participant). We sign up to have every purchase tracked by companies, whether online or through ""perks"" programs. There is much convenience in these programs, as companies cater marketing to our personal needs and desires. They get better at predicting what we will want to purchase and to make those things more readily available to us. Invasive email and phone screening by the NSA probably helps efforts to track down terrorists and other criminals. But of course every time we yield another corner of our privacy we lose something that is difficult if not impossible to reclaim.1984 is as thought-provoking as any book I've read this year."
326,Daniel Splittchinzki,"It is now evident to me why 1984 is a literary classic. It is not for memorable characters, or for beautiful language, or because of a mass appeal. 1984 is not, as I wrongfully predicted, about a crazy hypothetical omnipotent police state, nor about a lone revolutionary. 1984 is about what it is to be human. It is about belonging to society. It is about the meaninglessness and helplessness and mundaninity of life. Throughout the ending of this, I could not help but recalling the ending of The Stranger.""Nothing, nothing mattered, and I knew why. So did he. Throughout the whole absurd life I'd lived, a dark wind had been rising toward me from somewhere deep in my future, across years that were still to come, and as it passed, this wind leveled whatever was offered to me at the time, in years no more real than the ones I was living. What did other people's deaths or a mother's love matter to me...we're all elected by the same fate...For everything to be consummated, for me to feel less alone, I had only to wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate.""I loved the philosophy behind 1984, but I cannot excuse Orwell's mid-novel essay, in which he re-hashes and spells out every single idea presented within the novel so far. It is dull, redundant, and completely brakes the established cadence of the novel.plusgood lol"
327,Tiffany K.,"This was my first speculative fiction novel. I am in a state of shock at how enjoyable this book was and didn't know what to expect at first. The first quarter of the book had my mind blown so many times at how eerie the whole thing was. And how much of it could be so true it's scary. How an idea could get under your skin and inside your mind. This book was so good in so many ways. However it did get to a point of extreme boredom somewhere in the middle where Winston read ""the book"" and I remembered flipping the pages to see how much of this long repetitive explanation of what The Party was doing was left. Other than about 10 or 20 pages of this, I absolutely loved this book. It sets out to define, in the crudest way, that every man is for himself and no emotion or feeling in the world could betray his very basic instinct to survive. And how it's even possible to brainwash the non-believers. If you think about it, you could even relate to some of the fundamental principles of the book to what is happening around you... I would recommend this book!"
328,Erica Hasselbach,Still my all time favorite book. The theme of the novel will never become out dated. I'm just so glad to finally have my own copy. 
329,Carla Kovach,What can I say. I love this book. It's one of my favourites.
330,Wafa,"إن الحرب، إذا ما قيست بمعايير الحروب القديمة، هي مجرد خداع ودجل، بل هي أشبه بالمعارك التي تنشب بين حيوانين من الحيوانات المجترة تأخذ قرونهما أثناء نطاحهما زاوية تجعل أحدهما عاجزا عن إلحاق الأذى بالآخر.لكن بالرغم من هذا الزيف فإنها ليست خلوا من المغزى، فهي تلتهم الفائض من السلع الاستهلاكية كما تسهم في الحفاظ على المناخ الفكري الخاص الذي يحتاج إليه المجتمع الطبقي. وكما سيتضح فيما بعد فإن الحرب قد أصبحت شأنا داخليا محضا، ففي الماضي كانت الفئات الحاكمة في جميع الأقطار، ورغم إدراكهم لمصالحهم المشتركة ومن ثم سعيهم إلى تحجيم مدى الخراب الذي تسببه الحروب، يقاتل بعضهم بعضا وكان الغالب دائما ينهب المغلوب، أما في وقتنا الراهن فلم يعد الاقتتال ينشب بينهم مطلقا، وإنما أصبحت كل فئة حاكمة تشن الحرب على رعاياها ولم يعد هدف الحرب هو الاستيلاء على الأراضي أو الحيلولة دون ذلك، وإنما الحفاظ على بنية المجتمع سليمةعلى ما هي عليه.ومن ثم فإن كلمة "" الحرب "" ذاتها باتت مضللة ولا تؤدي المعنى، وإذا شئنا الدقة يمكننا القول بأن الحرب لم تعد حربا بعدما صارت إليه من ديمومة واستمرار. أما ذلك التأثير الذي ظلت تمارسه على البشرية فيما بين العصر الحجري وأوائل القرن العشرين فقد تلاشى ليحل محله شيء مختلف تماما. "
331,Lilly Minasyan,"Oh.My.God! What a book! This changed my life for once and all. I can not believe that someone could rate this book 1 or two stars. I hope that this book will never become a reality. I think I would definitely be in Ministry of Love. The way George Orwell wrote this book was in-depth. I was clenching my teeth when Smith was suffering. It felt like i could feel everything he was going through. I don't think he betrayed Julia. I don't believe he meant it, even if he says in the book. And he never loved the Big Brother. I think (for me) they did not break his spirit. I will recommend this book to every ignorant person I know in my life. This book will be one of those books which will show how grateful we should be that no one can really control your mind and emotions. They can't get inside of you. "
332,*Rigel,"ApokalypsisGià dall’incipit, quando il protagonista Wiston Smith, rientrando nei suoi modestissimi appartamenti, viene accolto dal lezzo stantio di cavoli bolliti e di stuoini logori, il lettore riesce a percepire l’atmosfera claustrofobica e catastrofica che lo accompagnerà fino all’epilogo.Quella che Orwell ci descrive è un’apocalisse in scala di grigi, un paradosso che rasenta il bluff, l’apogeo della corruzione umana; ci descrive una Londra irriconoscibile, uggiosa e pessimista, che aborrisce la vita in quanto tale, dilaniata da una società gerarchica senza scampo.La democrazia e le libertà sono ormai concetti astratti, superati, che perdono il loro stesso significato con la scomparsa dei termini con cui vengono descritte. Infatti la 
neolingua
 non prevede tutto questo; controllando la lingua si restringe al massimo la sfera d’azione del pensiero: ogni concetto sarà definito da una sola parola, tutti i significati ausiliari verranno tralasciati, dimenticati, sgretolati, perché futili, fuorvianti, pericolosi. Si potrà mai pensare a qualcosa come la libertà, quando il concetto stesso di libertà verrà abolito?Ma Londra non è che un granello di polvere nel deserto di sentimenti che sembra essere diventato il mondo del 1984. Un’epoca che sembra ridicola definire ai giorni nostri, un’epoca in cui l’ortodossia –o il non aver bisogno di pensare- regna sovrana, dove chi è troppo intelligente scompare, vaporizzato, dove i fatti e la storia vengono disintegrati, nell’indifferenza generale che costituisce il tacito assenso al regime. Un’epoca dove il mondo oggi conosciuto è scomparso, inghiottito nel gorgo dell’ambizione umana, racchiuso in tre superstati in perenne guerra fra loro: Oceania, Eurasia ed Estasia.Follia e saggezza si scambiano di posto e si confondono nella logica del 
bipensiero
, dove chiunque può sostenere tutto e il contrario di tutto, in un macabro gioco psichedelico, dove il nemico di un momento diviene l’alleato del giorno dopo, dove ci si può dimenticare in un attimo di aver tenuto fra le dita la prova di essere costantemente immersi nella più grande commedia che la mente umana potrà mai generare.Il Socing non è solo un partito. E’ il Partito, incarnato in un uomo baffuto che abbozza un sorriso sotto i folti baffi neri, con un’aria serena e decisa. Il Grande Fratello. Ti sta guardando, ti sta sorridendo. Oppure no.Il Socing descritto da Orwell è invincibile, manipola e plasma i suoi seguaci, anche se involontari, a sua immagine e somiglianza. E’ una forza che entra nella testa, qualcosa che martella il cervello, inculcandovi la paura di esprimere opinioni personali, persuadendo chiunque a negare l’evidenza, a diffidare dei propri sensi. Se il Partito proclamava che 2+2 era uguale a 5, allora tutti avrebbero dovuto crederci. Perché no? Se la realtà ci viene proiettata attraverso la nostra mente, chi ci assicura che la nostra mente sia sotto controllo? 
Chi ci assicura che non siamo totalmente folli?
E’ in questa realtà fatiscente d’ideali dove si muove il protagonista Wiston Smith, “l’ultimo uomo sulla terra”, l’unico che sembra volere e potere conservare una parvenza di umanità in una realtà che sembra aver perso tutto quello che la rende tale. Niente di speciale questo Wiston, non particolarmente intelligente, né particolarmente prestante, con un passato dimenticato e da dimenticare. Però ha voglia di vivere. Ha voglia di pensare, lottando contro i dettami del Socing; ha voglia di ribellarsi, inseguendo una vana utopia; ha voglia di amare e non solo al fine esclusivo di riprodursi. Ma neppure lui riuscirà a disertare, non riuscirà ad uscire dal cono d’ombra creato dal Grande Fratello, che ha i suoi occhi nei teleschermi che osservano la popolazione 24 ore su 24 e il suo braccio nella terribile psicopolizia; nel Ministero dell’Amore, davanti a uno specchio, vedendo il suo corpo scheletrico, la pelle grigia e lo sguardo spento, Wiston Smith capirà il paradosso della follia che diventa autodisciplina, capirà che l’ultimo uomo sulla terra, l’ultimo degno di essere chiamato tale, non è altro che una larva rachitica senza futuro, senza vie di fuga. Un verme che per combattere un regime inumano ha messo in palio la propria dignità, insieme alla propria vita e a quella di persone innocenti. Può questo essere ancora chiamato uomo?Non può sfuggire al Grande Fratello, se non attraverso la morte. Ma anche in quell’ultimo istante, lui conseguirà la sua vittoria. Sì, perché finalmente Wiston lo imparerà ad amare. 1984 si inserisce a pieno titolo nella corrente di romanzi europei che compaiono a cavallo del primo e del secondo dopoguerra, caratterizzati da un pessimismo radicato, conseguenza di una crisi di valori proprietà degli intellettuali borghesi nel positivismo e in tutte le correnti derivanti, come il comunismo. Questa corrente letteraria prende il nome di 
dystopia
 -antiutopia- e annovera fra i suoi “seguaci”, oltre ad Orwell, altre rispettabilissime personalità come Ray Bradbury. Orwell, al fine di combattere lo stalinismo e qualsiasi altra forma di totalitarismo, scrisse dapprima la celeberrima Animal Farm e poi 1984, titolo ottenuto invertendo le ultime due cifre dell’anno in cui l’autore incominciò la stesura del romanzo, il 1948. Questo baluardo del filone Cyberpunk, costituisce un’accusa chiara ed innegabile nei confronti della pretesa marxista-leninista di piegare la popolazione e la realtà per un fine superiore, ufficialmente la felicità del proletariato e ufficiosamente l’obbedienza al partito comunista stesso. Non è difficile, infatti, identificare la descrizione del Grande Fratello con il volto di Stalin, oppure quella dell’eversivo Goldstein con tratti somatici di Trotskij, il nemico numero uno dello stalinismo.Fondamentale risulta l’intreccio fra realtà romanzata e teorie politiche, incarnate nella figura del protagonista Wiston Smith (il cui nome “Wiston” deriva da Wiston Churchill e “Smith” è il cognome inglese più comune), il cui lavoro è quello di mutare perennemente la storia passata, non solo per celare errori e contraddizioni del Partito, ma anche per preservare la volubilità dell’uomo medio che non possiede alcun mezzo di ribellione se non la propria coscienza, facilmente discutibile.1984 è per eccellenza la meraviglia di Orwell, baluardo dell’utopia negativa, il cui principio centrale è la mutabilità del passato, dogma necessario per fissare la stabilità del regime e che si incarna perfettamente nell’agghiacciante e altrettanto indiscutibile verità condensata in uno slogan del Partito:“Chi controlla il passato, controlla il futuro.Chi controlla il presente, controlla il passato”Un vero capolavoro."
333,Aidan,"A defining book of political, societal, and human commentary; George Orwell's 1984 depicts a harrowing future in which undying statism and utter totalitarianism pervades totally throughout the population. The novel pledges its inner workings unto situationally self-aware narration from the main characters, who act as Orwell’s conduits, etching out the already well-detailed and masterfully crafted world in which the story is set, and expresses through skillful design of the rebarbative political boot it all exists under.The concepts dealt with on the political side are that of socialism (indirectly Stalinism), namely in the form of the ever-present ideology originally based on socialism, but also that of extreme nationalism and jingoism, where the population is geared towards a ceaseless hatred for all but their collective selves. The conspicuous and glaring being totalitarianism, to which almost every theme, notion and concept is built and expended upon to create this marvelous macrocosm. All of these political ideologies and themes are portrayed and crafted expertly throughout the entirety of the book, succeeding in the fear-instilling picture of the future in which it was striving for, leaving the reader totally engorged in the downcast portrait. As well as this, it doesn’t sacrifice political, philosophical, or ideological accuracy or realism for banalities in exchange to achieve this. While touching on the philosophical side, such as people and society, this is in a minor form, and ultimately pales in size or relevancy to the political. Notably, one reference is made, but is attributed to the overall political side. This, however, is not a hindrance to the plot; rather, it could be argued it is unnecessary given the context.Ubiquitously forlorn and destitute of happiness and colour, it is poignant, unremitting in its depressing bleakness—commendable, impeccable design for the setting; anything dissenting would have ultimately undermined the underlying tones and themes of the book. The imagery used is splendid as well, effortlessly venting the paralytic and constricting feelings of paranoia that the characters feel under such circumstances to the reader. The incessant use of propaganda pieces and the repetitive use of the party’s motto further drive in the claustrophobic feelings prevalent in the book among the characters, especially that of the main. The story never fails and never falters to ultimately consign the reader to the feelings or situational circumstances that the characters find themselves in.In all, 1984 is a masterwork of the political and social framework of a predicted society, and, under what Orwell saw, as a possible future for mankind if the political parties have their unregulated way, albeit exaggerated, but not impossible. The story and philosophical ideals behind it are thought provoking and intellectually edifying to say the least, and it goes without saying that 1984 truly deserves to be hailed as one of the genre defining novels of its time."

335,Chloé,"1984 de George Orwell se trouvait sur ma liste de livres à lire depuis une bonne décennie, et maintenant que je l’ai lu, je me demande pourquoi j’ai mis autant de temps avant de m’y attaquer. Il est certain que mes cours me gardaient bien occupée côté lecture et puis lorsque j’avais le temps et le désir de lire quelque chose, pour mon plaisir j’avais toujours une pile de livres à lire sur le côté du lit. La question est: pourquoi ne faisait-il pas partie de cette sculpture abstraite que formait l’amoncèlement de livres négligés dans ma chambre? Je crois que sa réputation m’intimidait, je m’attendais peut-être à une lecture difficile et épuisante et qu’en raison de toute la non-fiction que je devais consommer, j’étais davantage portée à attraper un livre divertissant et léger plutôt qu’un roman cité par divers groupes de militants et d’académiciens. Je me suis trompée, le livre est très accessible que ce soit dans le fond ou dans la forme, malgré qu’il y ait beaucoup de choses qui puissent être tirées de ce livre. C’est un livre qui vous fera définitivement réfléchir. plus1984 from George Orwell was on my to-be-read list for at least a decade. Now that I read it, I wonder why I took so much time to start. Sure my class kept me busy with reading, and when I had time and desire to read something for fun, I always had a pile of books to read on the side of my bed. The question is: why wasn’t it part of this abstract sculpture that was the accumulation of neglected books in my bedroom? I think I was intimidated by its reputation, maybe I was expecting a difficult and tiring read and because of all the non-fiction that I had to consume, I was brought to pick an entertaining and light book instead of a novel quote by militants and scholars. I was wrong, the book is really accessible as well in style than in substance, though there’s a lot to get from the book. This novel will definitely make you think. more"
336,Sofia,"1984 puts every dystopian to shame. I don't think I have ever read a novel more frightening and depressing; and yet, such are the originality, the suspense and the speed of writing and withering indignation that it is impossible to put the book down. A must-read."
337,Ahmad Wahby,Outstanding. It's astonishing how you can relate to it and how the writer perfectly predicted the future.
338,Kayden,"1984 is one of the must-read classics. It takes place in a reverse utopia, where everything the opposite of what we think is good. Everyone has been swayed to the one central belief that their country is perfect. At times this book makes you want to go ahhhhh!!!!! The main character is Winston. is his job to falsify anthing that would make the people realize how bad the situation is in the world definetly one my best reads yet.winston has a job at the ministery truth, his job is to get articles and documents out of a pnuematic tube and he takes the documents and changes them to agree with an idea that the goverment was always right and everyone believed that and would forget that the facts had been changed this was called ""double think"" in newspeak in old speak it is called ""countrolled reality""  He had a lover named julia there love was sacred, a jem in a storm of hatred. Their love is beautiful amazing strong and dangerous. They are a tiny bit of an old democratic age in a new world of hatred. their love was soon put to a stop when their hiding place in an old shop was discovered by the thought police and they were put in the ministry of peace.Big Brother used winstons greatest fear against him and in the end he betrayed julia and julia betrayed him. The concept endless war was to keep the supplies and goods to keep people in poverty and keep them angry, keep them blind. society in nine teen eighty four was to keep people blind and keep them away from the fact that the goverment was corupt and evil. to not have a world like 1984 one must give their people privacy and allow them to think differently and become unique. until next time, kayden lewis"
339,Fortunr,"A masterpiece in political fiction, a classic that should be read by everybody, regardless of the reader's political leanings. The book was created soon after the end of WWII, and it clearly reflects the political climate existing in Europe at the time. However the passionate and unforgettable cry by the author for individual freedom and social justice, so beautifully expressed in his book, are as relevant and as applicable today as they were over 60 years ago. We should never forget that the liberal / socialist democratic practises and institutions have been, if put in a wider historical / geopolitical context, the exception rather than the rule, and they are not a definite one-way street (just as an example, think about Weimer's democracy in Germany, which gave way so easily to Nazism). Democracy is fragile, and one of the main lessons of this book is that we should be always wary of giving any entity too much power or control - just look as an example at the Big Brother activities by the NSA in post-9/11 America, tramping so shamelessly on individual rights and international laws and treaties in the USA and especially abroad. What I also found very fascinating in the book is the analysis of the distinguishing features of the tyrannical society: in order to exert control over the lives of the citizen, you have to check and stop freedom of thought and scientific progress (the war on science currently waged by some powerful political circles in the USA comes to mind), and you have to inspire fear, hatred and nationalism. History (even very recent one) confirms that it is by exploiting the ""Love of Your Country"" message that you can get the ""proles"" to support whatever action (including invasions of other countries) you deem convenient at the time.Recent history is full of examples of modern, politically efficient totalitarian regimes presenting at least some of the distinguishing features highlighted by the author in his book: the years of Terror in Jacobin Revolutionary France are possibly the first example of modern totalitarian regime, followed by the Nazi State (where Goebbels exploited with real genius the technical possibilities offered by the new mass media such as radio and movies), and of course by Stalinism (as implemented in Russia but also in Eastern Europe and so visible now in North Korea). But in the advanced democracies dangers are also present - this book is a reminder that individual freedom is something to be treasured and defended against abuse and against the ideologies of Nationalism, fear and hatred that can always be exploited to erode these rights. "
340,Karmveer Yadav,Book is about a totalitarian government which has offered its inhabitants dystopia. This book also analyse the humans which is the most interesting part of this piece of art. Everything in this book satisfied my intellect until the end which is the most horrible part of it. The last thing doesn't satisfy my intellect or maybe I am too stubborn to accept a thing so dark you would rather die than to get introduced to that side.Someone explained the book to be 'Most Influential Book of all time'. I completely agree with the statement(although I don't accept last part) because maybe this is the book which started the paranoia of people against their governments.
341,Mohammed Abualgassim,"Review of 1984 “Big Brother is watching you!”This is not just a novel, it is a book that describes the essence of every dictatorship in the history, and just like the Ingsoc slogans every oppressive ruler is self contradictory:“WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH”1984 is the climax of Orwell’s brilliance, with its disturbing portrait of a dystopian future, which fell under the mercy of a power-hungry party that tries to control everything even the minds of the public.I read this book mainly because of its theme, it can be related to the situation of my country which is ruled by a vicious dictator, of course not as extreme as telescreens and the Thought police, but in some level it is similar to Oceania. But I think in every place in the world there are people like the ‘Party’ who will break any law, shatter any ethical principle, and do anything they can in the pursuit of power, because just like Orwell puts it:“Power is not a means, it is an end”"
342,Sarah,"Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.More than anything, 1984 is a social commentary and an ominous foretelling of the future done exactly right. It is the story of a man named Winston who, in the end, makes little to no difference in the eyes of the government because he is just one measley person of the lower class with a mediocre life. In this way, Orwell makes a story that matters for a little while, but in the end, dissipates under the eyes of Big Brother, which could make one wonder: Is Winston like everyone else? Surely he is not the only dissidant to be extinguished. I know that the dystopian genre is very popular in books nowadays, but I have never really gotten into it very much. However, I feel that 1984 is not just A dystopian novel- rather, it is THE dystopian novel, which means that is absolutely essential as well as the inspriation for a lot of other smaller dystopian books that follow. What is not to love about this book, after all? It gives a creepily sterilized feeling to a world that is purged of all forms of individuality. It makes a strong commentary about totalitarian governments as a whole, but the fictional world presented does not lose character. All in all, I think that this book is very close to being a perfect book (although to call it absolutely perfect would make me uneasy- that's such a strong statement!).WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH"

347,Polly Trout,"Scary quote of the day:""It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance."" I read this book and think, ""I have an ethical duty to fight against fascism, and for democracy and freedom."" It scares me to think that there are people in the world -- rich, powerful people -- reading this book and thinking, ""We must protect our interests by paying attention to Orwell's insight -- it is not safe to educate the poor, and the poor must be kept in poverty, or we will have to share power as well as wealth."" For a long time I thought that the ruling elite just didn't care that people were suffering -- and ignorant narcissism does drive much of the system. But not all of it; some of it is on purpose, with conscious intent, and this is a mindboggling concept to me. I'm not understanding what it must feel like to live inside that worldview, to consciously choose to make others suffer in order to amass power over others. I want to think that this is a fairy tale, a paranoid fantasy with no more reality than ogres or vampires. But they do exist, I've actually seen them and met them and had conversations with them. I've also spent most of my life thinking that these people can be saved; that they just need enough love and education, and then they will see the error of their ways and come over to the light. I think this stubborn delusion goes back to my childhood relationship with my father; I believed that he was raping me because I had failed in my duty to bring him to Jesus and save his soul. It was my fault, for not being good enough, for not praying hard enough, for not being a convincing enough missionary, for not being lovable enough -- because surely, if I was lovable enough and smart enough, would I be able to save his soul, and thus save all the people he was hurting? What was wrong with me that I couldn't realize this simple and clear vocational calling?Now I'm starting to think... maybe its not my fault. Maybe there is something wrong with them, the men at the top of the pyramid that rape and oppress. Maybe loving them and educating them is not sufficient. Maybe we need to come up with a more practical set of deterrents. Maybe they need to be firmly yet politely escorted to those prisons they keep building."

349,Carmine,"Ci sarebbe da fare un tema su un libro di tale importanza storica e letteraria.Mi limito a dire che letto ancora adesso è calzante, anzi è terribilmente inquietante per le somiglianze con la società attuale.Poi l'iconico ""Big Brother"" è spaventoso, sicuramente uno degli elementi più riusciti del libro e della fantascienza in generale."
350,Christopher Campbell,"Few novels grab a society by storm and sink roots into the social fabric well past its prime. 1984 by George Orwell did just that, with obvious aftershocks still visible (including the television show ""Big Brother,"" ""Room 101,"" and multiple film versions). The work immediately grabbed me, which I admit is not the normal reaction I garner from other readers. However, I feel the book is worth the effort of pushing forward. The novel focuses on Winston Smith and his doubts within a totalitarian socialist regime known as Oceania (which comprises England, North America, and other territories) as it wages war against two other super powers. Smith questions the blend between reality and fiction as a writer constantly reshaping the past; Orwell himself focuses on the inevitable corruption of the same socialism he was a proponent of earlier in life. Without a doubt, the most powerful dystopian novel, 1984 brings one on a psychological thriller of the repercussions of a man over-stepping the bounds of a totalitarian regime. With cultural echoes continuing to the present, I feel that 1984 is a harrowing warning of what a government (or even a singular person) with too much power is capable of."

I could not same book as publisher. no problem?.......................................................................July 17,1984 (this is Review)Winston Smith is a citizen, or should I say a comrade, of the country, Oceania. Oceania is a communist country where Big Brother rules. Big Brother always watches over his citizens. These citizens, comrades, are not allowed to call anybody with any title except comrade. There are telescreens, which are the like CCTV’s and TV’s, all over the places. They watch people what they do. People of Oceania are not allow to record, or write ant part of history. I f someone does, he will disappear in a night, and no one will ever remember him, not even that he existed. However, it’s different from Winston because he has a private room in his apartment, which is older than him, and telescreens cannot see him while he is in there. He starts writing diary, which the date starts at April 4th, 1984.At the work, all the workers have to go into the 2 MINUTE HATE. In there the telescreen will show them about some person, or people, talking about the freedom and the importance of Capitalism. Then, someone in the crowd of workers will curse those people from telescreen, and everybody starts cursing them altogether. Winston realizes that this is stupid and worthless of doing, but he doesn’t stop cursing because he knows that if he does then someone will notice, and turn him in the government........................................................................July 31, Even though 24hours ago Big Brother announced that they are going to lower the chocolate ration from 30grams to 20grams, they just announced that they are going to increase the chocolate ration to 20grams. People believe it, and cheer it. Nothing was better than before. Everything is getting worse and worse, but the government shows the stupid-fake-written graphs through the tele-screen, and applauds the Big Brother.Now he’s back to the cafeteria at his work. The nasty food with strange evil taste disgusts Winston, but greasy coffee is worse. In this crowded and noisy cafeteria, Winston notices a girl who’s been following him. Winston’s now scared because she might be a though police, and he might be get caught. Syme noticed Winston keep looking at the girl, and tells him that he should ask her to go out with him.Winston was writing on his diary about one night, when there was nobody else but him and a woman on a street. Of course this is a crime, but she told him that he can buy her only for 2 dollars. He wanted to do it because he had never had sex before, and he thought it was a shame. Then Winston thought about her ex-wife Katherine who he was married at the night of temptation. She had no desire of sex even though that’s why they got married. Every night Winston tried to lay on with her she would refuse. Well actually she didn’t want to do it nor did she want to do it. That’s why he never could have had sex with her. Finally, the government split them up.Winston went to the bed with the woman he found on the street. He turned the lamp on, and she was at least 50 years old. He did her anyway.On his diary he criticizes about the capitalism. How they have sex all the time. They party all the time. Especially how they live a horrible life. He knew of course most of them must be lie, but he couldn’t tell."
354,Caleb Abel,"I’m really not sure where to begin with my thoughts on 1984. I know I loved it to the extent that it’s very nearly on the verge of booting Neil Gaiman’s American Gods out of my Top 5 Books of All Time list. I know I’m sad I hadn’t read it long before now, and I know I don’t want to go into too great of detail for fear of spoiling it for anyone that hasn’t read it.It’s difficult to call the book perfect because there are definitely times when it drags and it feels like Orwell is trying harder to share his thoughts and philosophies on a mishmash of government systems than he is to tell a story, but at the same time all of those thoughts are incredibly apropos as much today as they were over 50 years ago when the book was first published. The longevity of this relevance makes the pause in storytelling seem necessary to forgive. The world he creates is so real and so filled with allusion that it’s unparalleled to anything I’ve ever read with a similar purpose.Since the ending is one of the best I've ever read, I'm scared to talk in too great of detail because I'd hate to give anything away at all. I'll just say I think it's a book everyone should read. Maybe once Laura reads it I'll go into more detail."
355,Michael Russel,"George Orwell's classic was incredibly visionary. It is hardly fathomable that this book was written in 1948. Things that we take for granted today - cameras everywhere we go, phones being tapped, bodies being scanned for weapons remotely - all of these things were described in graphic detail in Orwell's book.Now that we have the Internet and people spying on other people w/ webcams and people purposely setting up their own webcams to let others ""anonymously"" watch them, you can see how this culture can develop into the Orwellian future described in ""1984."" If you've heard such phrases as ""Big Brother,"" ""Newspeak,"" and ""thought crime"" and wondered where these phrases came from, they came from this incredible, vivid and disturbing book.Winston Smith, the main character of the book is a vibrant, thinking man hiding within the plain mindless behavior he has to go through each day to not be considered a thought criminal. Everything is politically correct, children defy their parents (and are encouraged by the government to do so) and everyone pays constant allegiance to ""Big Brother"" - the government that watches everyone and knows what everyone is doing at all times - watching you shower, watching you having sex, watching you eat, watching you go to the bathroom and ultimately watching you die. This is a must-read for everyone."
356,Vittorio Viegas,"This book doesn't need an introduction but for those who don't know, this is pretty much one of the most important novels of the present days."
357,Mason Spaulding,"I like to read about military history, science fiction, and post apocalyptic. 1984 was one of the best of those genres I have read in a long time.Winston was the main character. He works for the Ministry of Truth. Since he's living in a totalitarian government, his job is to rewrite the history of the state. As the book progresses he starts to question the way of life living under Big Brother. But he has to be careful because the government has tv's that can receive, as well as transmit.The setting is the year 1984. After World War II, three superstates were formed. The US annexed Great Britain and became Oceania, which is the largest of the superstates. The Soviet Union invaded the rest of Europe and formed Eurasia. The third superstate is Eastasia, which is made up of China, Japan, Korea, and Indochina. Throughout the book, the superstates are constantly at war with each other, execpt each state is so powerful, that none of them can be defeated.The author George Orwell was sure that after World War II, Great Britain would turn into a dictatorship. So basically, this story is like his diary, telling his opinions on ""the world of tomorrow""."
358,Evanille," Hacer la reseña de este libro va a ser realmente difícil, siendo mi libro favorito.Las cosas distopicas me emocionan.Este libro habla de las prisiones que nos imponen desde que nacimos. De las ataduras que no nos podemos sacar. De cómo la gente con poder no nos quiere dejar pensar.Imagínate en un mundo donde casi no hay nada para comer, hay cámaras en tu casa, y tienes que modificar los libros y periódicos para contarle mentiras a la gente contra tu voluntad. No puedes pensar lo que quieras, porque el gobierno te encarcelara. No puedes amar a nadie, ni tener sentimientos. Esto, es lo que se vive en 1984Winston Smith, el protagonista, se parece en cierta forma a mí. Abre los ojos y deja de hacer lo que la sociedad espera y te ordena. Es un rebelde de pensamiento. Quiere ser libre, pensar tranquilamente. Porque sabe que no lo es, porque sabe que metafóricamente, está en una prisión (y literalmente en cierta forma también)Todo en el libro es macabro y fríamente calculado.Este libro me ha hecho llorar de pena y alegría, me ha hecho ponerme en el lugar del desdichado Winston. Me he sentido en Oceanía. No exagero al calificar este libro como obra maestra, o el mejor libro que me he leído (y eso es decir mucho)Obra preciosa, desesperanzadora, triste y llena de esperanza a la vez.Exquisitez para los sentidos.Me arrepiento de haberla leído, porque creo ahora nunca leeré algo mejor. Tienen que leerlo."
359,Megan Skelton,"This book is pure art.The principles in this book left me reeling and on more than one occasion I had to put it down, stare at a wall and contemplate life.It's not what I was expecting at all, to be perfectly honest I don't know what I was expecting but it's far more intense then I could have hoped for. This isn't light reading! It took me longer than usual to finish this one, not because I found it boring, on the contrary it was mentally stimulating, so much so that I had to take breaks to process what I'd read.At first it seems like another dystopian future novel... Oh how wrong I was. I literally believed it would be a simple overthrow-the-evil-government-and-get-the-girl novel so I was shocked at the end.I promise no spoilers but this book is far more than I originally thought it would be. If I'm honest I didn't particularly like Winston to begin with, what startled me was that even though I was sure I didn't like him I was able to relate to him and sympathise his situation (which is not what I intended at all!)I also thought I didn't like the Party, Big Brother and the whole idea of Oceania's social structure. I was again shocked that their twisted policies actually made sickening sense. This book is something I believe everyone should read, not just because it is a fantastic book but simply because it contains ideals that we can all learn from. "
360,Anurag Shrivastava,"Truly a masterpiece! I can't envisage a dystopian novel that could be better than this!What if you were impelled to live in a society where every act of yours is watched? Even your face can't afford to betray your feelings; ""Thought-Police"" is there to scrutinize each your facial expression every moment, and you are evaporated on the basis of a crime that was not even committed, was merely thought! Your children are trained to conduct espionage in their own home, and parents are brainwashed so much as to feel pride in it! A society where only one kind of love exists: love towards 'Big Brother!' A society where two plus two may be anything! I can't imagine a more horrible society than this -- a scary and complex dystopian world.It is one of those books that everyone should read at least once. I recommend it to everyone."

364,A Drop of Romeo,"In order to read this masterpiece, you need to appreciate the history behind it. In 1917, civil war broke out in Russia and eventually the Bolsheviks gained power. By 1921, their Communist party was established, though its leader, Lenin, died, leaving two candidates: Trotsky and Stalin. Stalin was the underdog, only the General Secretary, but by 1926 he removed all former members of the government (his position as secretary allowed him to move his friends to influential positions), created trials to dismiss men with power and exiled Trotsky, who would later be described as a ‘Capitalist spy’ in history books. Stalin soon found himself in a position of power and the secret police and the cult of his image allowed him full control, which also spread a feeling of fear and uncertainty throughout the USSR. No one knew who to trust, no one knew what to do. Some people were tortured beyond pain imaginable and begged for the end to come, others were sent to concentration camps in Siberia, forced to work under harsh winter conditions and then left to die. At times, a person had committed no crime but was arrested nonetheless in order to fulfill a certain quota. Because of this, Stalin is responsible for 60 million deaths. To illustrate this point, there is an anecdote in which Stalin meets with a leader of an African nation and this leader asks: ‘How many people did you have to kill in order to establish your rule?’ Stalin tells him and this leader is astonished because it’s more than the number of people who live in his country.However, before 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell and the secrets of the USSR were exposed, no one was aware of the chilling and inhumane acts that were committed. For instance, in 1980, when a book entitled Archipelago Gulag was published, describing the violence present within the nation and its concentration camps, there was much skepticism. After all, many socialists from Western European countries viewed the USSR as a country with the ideal government. Not much had changed since 1949 when Orwell, frustrated by his socialist acquaintances who dreamt of living in the USSR, wrote 1984 as a response. It was a perfectly haunting - and very real - description of the Communist states back then, and still is now.Reviewed for A Drop of Romeo"
365,Himel Sarkar,"George Orwell in his signature style builds a society around things we take for granted in our everyday life. Things like our perception of reality. He rightly establishes that reality is but a figment of our mind and it is altered everyday by the largest hegemonic powers of the world today. He underscores our responsibility to open our eyes and break the culture of internalization of morally bankrupt ideas. My favorite passage was - ""The birds sang, the proles sang, the Party did not sing. All round the world, in London and in New York, in Africa and in Brazil, in the mysterious, forbidden lands beyond the frontiers, in the streets of Paris and Berlin, in the endless Russian plains, in the bazaars of China and Japan- stood the same unconquerable figure, made monstrous by work and childbirth, toiling from birth to death and still singing. Out of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day come. You were the dead. Theirs was the future. But you could share in the future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive their body, and passed on the secret doctrine that two and two make four."""
366,Domenico Caputo,"Finalmente mi sono deciso a seguire Winston Smith all'interno di questo incubo che non lascia scampo all'uomo, immaginato quasi 70 anni fa da Orwell. Il Grande Fratello osserva tutto, è dentro ogni casa, stabilisce cosa devi pensare e dire, riscrive il passato a proprio piacimento e fa scomparire chiunque abbia un dubbio o un accenno di dissenso contro il Partito....1984, oltre a entrare di diritto nella mia top5, è il posto dove andare a guardare quando osserviamo il mondo e pensiamo che le cose peggio di così non potrebbero andare! "
367,Mackenzie,"This book is so captivating and intriguing. It is quite eery how this novel was meant to predict a distopian society for 1984, and how our society today has a shocking number of similarities with the corrupt system of government in 1984. "
368,majoringinliterature,"Originally Posted at Majoring in Literature.Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the ancient time, to a time when there were still privacy, love, and friendship … His [mother] had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable. Such things, he saw, could not happen today. (Part One, Chapter III)Almost everybody knows that chilling phrase, 'Big Brother is watching you'. At some uncertain age, we all inevitably grasp the significance of those words, even if we have never read the book which gave birth to it. What's more, the phrase seems even more apt today than it was when the book was first published. Though the year 1984 has long passed us by, Orwell's novel is still hugely relevant to its readers. I'd long been familiar with the phrase 'Big Brother is watching you'. I understood it. I used it in conversation. I thought it expressed something about the digital age in which we were living, the age of cameras in supermarkets and personalised advertisements in the mail. What I didn't fully grasp was, of course, its origins. This led me to seek out Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, to try and get to grips with why the words 'Big Brother' send such a chill through the spine.* In Orwell's novel, set in England in (yes, you've guessed it) 1984, the country is controlled by The Party. Also known as Ingsoc (or English Socialists), the Party monitors their citizens constantly, observing the way they work, act, and even think. Of course, the implications of this scenario are disturbing enough. But what's more, the Party's ministries are giant propaganda machines, constantly re-writing history in order to ensure that the Party appears all-knowing. The main character of the novel, Winston Smith, works in one such ministry. He spends his days re-writing newspaper articles and speeches, manipulating truth and history for the benefit of Ingsoc. As with most dystopian novels, the plot centres around Winston's dissent against the party, and eventually his desire to be a part of the shadowy Brotherhood, which is determined to destroy the Party. Winston first has an illicit affair with another Ministry worker, called Julia. She, too, dreams of bringing down the system. She works in the fiction department of the Ministry, where she is a mechanic responsible for repairing the machines which write books. Which made me think about 
If on a Winter's Night a Traveller
, where book-writing and book-reading machines are also a reality. It was just one of the disturbing scenarios which inform this book.(view spoiler)[So far, so good. The plot feels familiar to me, something I have read and seen in countless books and films. But then it takes a strange turn. I won't say more, lest I spoil the ending, but it is not the happy, life-affirming conclusion we have come to expect from our dystopic books. It is bleak and dark, and I found it disturbing even as I found myself liking it.  (hide spoiler)]When this book was first released in 1949, many people were quick to draw parallels with Stalinist Russia. The Thought Police, the propaganda, the moustachioed image of Big Brother; it certainly doesn't take a whole lot of imagination to make the link. I'm sure that many of the book's initial readers were only too happy to look no further than a denunciation of socialism. But there is a clear criticism of European and American practices as much as of Russian. And Orwell's examination is still very pertinent today, when we are daily bombarded with so many different versions of truth on the internet (or consider, for instance, a recent ruling in a European court that ordered Google to delete links to some personal information about an individual, which led to the company being flooded by requests from criminals to remove information of their past crimes). This particular quote is quite telling: ""Even the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance"" (Part Three, Chapter IX). Naturally, the reader wonders what has happened to Ingsoc; does someone eventually overthrow it? Or does the Party's dream of total and everlasting power eventuate? (view spoiler)[Orwell certainly concludes the novel in a way that seems to suggest that, at least for the moment, the Party is all-powerful. Strangely, though, at the end of the book is an appendix with an essay about Newspeak, the 'language' Ingsoc has invented to stamp out 'thoughtcrime'. The reader is invited to turn to this appendix at an earlier point in the book, but I decided to leave it until last. Interestingly, the article adopts a scholarly tone, speaking about Newspeak in the past tense, analysing it as though it is a part of history, in a manner similar to the conclusion of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. To me, this suggested that at some point, the Party was overthrown, or perhaps changed form. In either case, the fact that the article is written in regular English certainly implies that Newspeak failed. Possibly the Party failed as well.Of course, in the end we can't be sure what happens. Rather than ending the book on a positive note, Orwell leaves us with a bleak ending which reminds readers how serious his vision of the future could be.  (hide spoiler)]I'm going to finish this review with a passage I found particularly disturbing; Winston is told to imagine the future as ""a boot stamping down on a human face"". In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy – everything … There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother... There will be no art, no literature, no science… There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life … If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever. (Part Three, Chapter III).Rating: 4.5 Stars*Apart from the very real fear of accidentally stumbling across the reality TV show while channel-surfing, of course."
369,Stephanie Rivera,"My heart started pounding for the start, the thought of being constantly watched still terrifying to me, even if its borderline our current reality. This book is so well written I was hooked with the first sentence. This book embodies the creepiness of having you're entire life controlled. From the disturbing telescreens to the horror of two mintues of hate, you will be transferred into a world where fear and hope are entangled into one. A place where public hanging are a popular event with children and even your own thoughts aren't safe. Where war is literally a laughing matter and ongoing. History is unreliable snd changing always to the party's liking. Papers altered for the sake of Big Brother to seem all knowing, all wise and always right. Doublethink! A world filled with contrary, conflicting and potentially thoughts that could get you labled a thought crimnal and killed. Once killed for this crime, or one such like it, despite the lack of laws might I add, you are erased and your existence never happened. Facecrime, thoughtcrime, you were told to be a mindless droid, and to love it. If that's not horrifying enough for you, and you so happen to be a lover of words, well Newspeak and all the tall of how its created will horrify you. This brilliantly written story will horrify you and the ending will leave you sadden."
370,..Effat..,أحيانا نرغم على الاستسلام والخنوع رغما عنا لكن أعتقد أن الشعور بالخزي والعار أمام أنفسنا لن يزول أبدا مهما حاولنا إقناعها بأن مافعلناه !كان هو الحل الوحيد :)أعجبتني 
371,Paul Gollic,"For as long as I live I will always remember the day I finished ""1984,"" the first time I read it, while seated in the back of my high school trigonometry class. Inconsolable, I gazed over the last five words - completely devastated - and sobbed uncontrollably.In the ten or more times I have reread it since, I was no less shocked and shattered by the book's conclusion. Ostensibly a cautionary tale about a midlevel bureaucrat assigned to help reduce the number of words in the dictionary, ""1984"" is the tragic story of Winston Smith, a freethinking, middle aged man, who through glimmers of a childhood memories and clandestine visits to ""prole"" neighborhoods (newspeak for poor), radically tries to reconcile life in a totalitarian nanny state.With the omnipresent hum of the tele-screen always present, Winston is the perfect party patsy, saluting the authorities and seething with anger at the daily ""two minutes hate"" that secretly leave our hero wondering who is the Emmanuel M. Goldstein, the object of the government's loathing.When despite medical problems too gruesome to recount and enough secret spies to fill a Le Carre novel, Winston Smith conjures up enough optimism to pursue a romantic relationship with Julia, ""1984"" takes on a frightening turn. A devoted (or maybe not)? member of the Junior Anti-Sex League, whose signature emblem is the form-fitting sash that hugs seductively around her waistline, Julia is perhaps not the refuge Winston seeks. Or is she?Without destroying the truly devastating ending, I would wholeheartedly recommend 1984 to anyone who is interested in politics, language, romance and government.Yes, you may be left devastated by the book's last five words, but you will certainly be left with more to think about than drying your tears. - Regina McMenamin "
372,Onur,A classic masterpiece by Orwell. A must read for anyone-who-is-anyone. 
373,Andrea E,"1984 takes place in the land of Oceania (London, England) in the year 1984. Author George Orwell, writing the novel in 1949, perceived that in 1984 England could be a similar to the world of Oceania, where privacy no longer exists, the rich, or the Party, rule everything, the citizens starve and must conform to contradictory concepts such as Newspeak and Doublethink, and most importantly, Big Brother is always watching. The protagonist, Winston, bored with his life, secretly hating the Party, rebels both physically and mentally, and discovers the true wicked core principles of his society, struggling to maintain his sanity while Oceania’s government works endlessly to make him, and every other citizen of Oceania, lose it. The novel is written in third-person limited point of view, giving the novel a level of detachment, which reflects the detached relationships of Oceania’s citizens, and Orwell writes concise and direct, mimicking the bleak lives of Oceania’s citizens. His descriptions emphasize the dull atmosphere of their world, and he characterizes the characters by taking us into their thoughts, giving them symbolic significance, making important characters appear later in the novel, displaying much of their dialogue, and emphasizing their lack of intimacy with each other and how the Party affects them individually as well as as a whole. The novel includes themes concerning the human need for connection, expression, and privacy, mental sanity, and the possible effects of totalitarianism and English Socialism, that are displayed through the characters’ actions and their final situations. The novel has a high level of literary merit, for it thoroughly presents what a society of totalitarianism could lead to, and it uses literary techniques to embed important messages in readers’ minds that can apply to the future. "
374,Belle,"I thoroughly enjoyed George Orwell's haunting novel, 1984. Orwell perfectly executed the purpose of this tale. The complete control of a totalitarian government is enough to shock any reader. Orwell's grim tone is evident through out the book. His language is solemn to match the heavy content of the novel. Although this is not a ""enjoyable"" read, it is though provoking and intriguing. Orwell skillfully crafted one of every free citizens' greatest fear, the complete loss of identity. In this world every lower class citizen is identical and they are rule by the few higher political member of The Party. Nobody is free. There are telescreens in every room that monitor behavior, a mandatory ""Physical Jerk"" in the morning, and a planned out life that is identical to everyone else. It was illegal to keep past notes or photographs so The Party can convince the citizens of anything they want to be true. There was an instance in the book when during a rally the Party switches its enemy half way through. The speaker must change his speech and everyone takes this in stride. They are even embraced for having the wrong signs. Orwell depicts a country that is everyone worst nightmare. This is enough to shock anyone into rejection a communist or totalitarian regime."
375,Abdullah Obaied,"I don't think I've ever given a rating of 5 to any book before.I'll gladly do for this one just for this quote alone: ""Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past""."

I can say this is far and away the better book.Since I cannot make the conference I am about to write my observations, so spoiler alert!!Nothing is illegal since there are no longer any lawsWinston has the idea to write in a diary to communicate with the future.Daily there is two minutes of hate which is impossible not to participate in and Emmanuel goldstien is on the screen.Women seem to swallow the slogans more.OBrien says we shall meet in the place where ther is no darkness. but he actually means in tougher interrogation conditions.DICTIONARY IS TO CUT WORDS DOWN!!!!!eventually thoughtcrime will be impossible because there will be no words to express it.Orthodoxy means unconsciousness.A lunatic might be a minority of one.The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. p71. That sums it up.Goodthinkful,if you are lucky you don't probe and youre naturally orthodox.What is the importance of the poem about the church bells that keeps being repeated? He finally gets manifesto and says the best books are the ones that tell you what you wlready know. P.178. Unfortunately it wasn't the real story. there is no room for Winston in the party.First and simplest stage in discipline is crimestop.p.188 stopping short at the threshold of any dangerous thought.The mutability of the past is the central tenet of ingsoc.no present statement can ever have been wrong.Human equality has to be subverted for Big Brother to be all powerful and you cant just act like you believe. you have to believe."
380,davidson1,"1984, by George Orwell might just be my favorite novel ever. It takes place in Great Britain, after a post atomic war, with a government that has total control over it's people, even their thoughts. The main character Winston Smith works for the Ministry of Truth in rewriting history, he is a part of the 'Outer Party"" who make up 13% of the population and are equivalent to our middle class. The reason I loved this book so much, as how oddly similar the world portrayed in this book and how our modern world our headed today. This book was really an eye opener and has left me with many questions that are impossible to answer. I would recommend this book to anyone, and guarantee you will love it."
381,John,"This is considered a literary masterpiece and rightly so.The setting is the year 1984. A tyrannical dictatorship is in control of Great Britain, and the ordinary citizens of the country are being brainwashed into being party drones. Those who resist are dealt with mercilessly. We follow an ordinary man called Winston Smith; Ordinary, except for the fact that he has not fallen under the spell of the regime, and plans to remain free from their doctrines.Because of the fact that the plot involves one man's struggle against oppression, it's an immensely human story. Through his eyes, we feel the horror he feels, the sadness for the loss of human liberty, and the yearning to break through it all and live a free and happier life. In short, George Orwell takes the reader directly to this fictional London in 1984.Orwell introduces moments of dark humour, such as the continual appearance of Winston's next door neighbour; a bumbling, middle aged fool who is one of the ''sheep'' who lives to breathe the party's cheap slogans, and attends scout club table tennis playing sessions for his exercise.But there are also other occurances that keep the story constantly interesting, such as people being ''erased'' from existence, and Winston's job at the records office, where his daily duties include falsifying records to meet the party requirements.The main course of the plot though is of course what happens to Winston, and I was gripped and excited at his inevitable and gloomy plight.The overriding message of the book is of course one of freedom; something that we must value and hold on to, and let no one take that away from us. This book is a stark warning against the evils of dictatorship and oppression, and that warning comes across loud and clear thanks to Orwell's fantastic clinical and to the point writing style."
382,Christopher Slater,"The father of all dystopian novels, 1984 earned its place not only as a classic, but as a source of several phrases that have become a part of the English vernacular. While there are literally thousands of reviews, essays, papers, etc. that center around the political and social themes and lessons of the novel, I want to point out something from 1984 that truly stood out to me. Orwell has an amazing grasp of human psychology. While most people focus on the fact that the government, or Big Brother, controls the lives of its citizens, what amazed me about this book was how Big Brother controlled the citizenry. A scene from the book that always stood out to me was when there was a rally in support of the war being fought. In the middle of the rally, the presenter is given a message stating that the nation that they had been fighting was now their ally and that their former ally was now their enemy. The speaker changes what he was saying without skipping a beat, but he couldn't change the words on the posters and banners that were hanging there. Rather than questioning why things had suddenly changed, the citizens gathered for the rally looked at the posters and banners and decided that it was some sort of devious trick by their new enemy and began tearing them down. One has to wonder how a large group of people could be so completely brainwashed as to accept a lie that was proven wrong right in front of them. Orwell does a masterful job of showing exactly how it can be done, and it is truly a frightening and captivating reading.If you have never read 1984, I consider it a ""must read."" If you have read it, read it again. So much within its pages will stick with you for a long time."

387,Hussam Ali," I think what makes George Orwell novels very popular is that everybody can relate to it to some extend. And when it comes to totalitarian dictatorships, the connection becomes quite astonishing, prompting you to think that this book is nothing but a prophecy of your very own society.  In the beginning I thought that the book was a depiction of the failed communist Russia-just like animal farm, I mean it was obvious, big brother was Stalin and Goldstein must be Trotsky. But later I realized that wasn't the case, because the year was supposed to be 1984 among other clues. I have come to understand that this was Orwell's extrapolation of the state of affairs when he wrote the novel at 1949. Evidently, that prediction didn't turn out to be literally true and the world wasn't divided into 3 superstates- instead 2 rivaling camps with capitalism triumphing later on. What is important however is that the book essence proved to be true. In today's world notions such as: doubelthink, thought crime and newspeak are present with different names, even in the most liberal of societies, take the united states so called war on terrorism as example.  On a personal level, I connected very well with the story, initially I thought of myself as an underground revolutionary thinker in a draconian society, just like Winston Smith. Later on, I found that I'm better represented by the proles, I would better describe myself as an ideologically confused workman, lost in the mist of suffering with no clear objectives for change or liberation. Yet, I'm glad that I'm not a party member. After all Smith kept reiterating that the hope lies on the proles. "
388,Navaneeta,Orwell would have made an excellent god! An amazing book whose resonance can be better appreciated in the modern times.

391,Joshua Lowery,"It is my opinion that more people bought it and talked about it than read it, for it is a dreadfully dull book-didactic, repetitious and all but motionless.Isaac Asimov-I have to agree. However, the way in which the book presents Stalinism, torture, language, and most of all an insight into the human condition, was the hook which caught me. This book left me wanting more, and thinking, the marks of great literature. Eric Blair wrapped his warning against big government up in an understandable Dystopian society, and everyone should unwrap it for themselves."
392,Ziad Nofal,"In the novel George Orwell created a dystopian 1984 which is away from what that year turned out to be. But currently we are living in that future with no privacy as everything about you is known through the internet wether you like it or not. Big Brother as an icon is also becoming more and more realistic as media ""specifically Egyptian"" now demonise yesterday's heroes ""The Revolutionaries"" while they stand with yesterday's demons, They tend to change their opinions just to stay alive and increase their wealth and the public believe what they are told even when they no it is not logical, That brings me to another thing which people suffer from which is that they demonise you if you have an opinion other than their own even if they know you are right because what you are saying is logical which reminds me of thoughtcrime. In my opinion this great book is one of the best ever written although a change of title to ""2014"" would be more realistic perhaps."

Tanto el control de la información como el ""doble-pensar"" contribuyen a que no exista una memoria colectiva y puedan ser engañados fácilmente.

400,Ellie Sorota,"Wow. Wow. Wow. I can't think of the last time a book left my jaw hanging open. I'm not sure how I missed this in school, but what a piece of literature! Rather unexperienced in the genre of dystopian literature, I floored from the outset and plan to follow this rabbit trail with We (Zamyatin).I won't attempt anything about plot (plenty is already out there). Instead, I'll speak to Orwell's gift of an alternate reality so succinctly and beautifully crafted with literary ease. Orwell allows just enough light and shadow in 1984 for the reader to be swept up in Oceania as a reality, yet permitting questions and doubts about where true north lies. With masterful balance throughout: from description, to dialogue, thought and memory, Orwell shows a craft for storytelling that is hard matched. Writers tend to have a gift for person, place or plot; sometimes in pairs, but all three is something of a unicorn. In 1984, one realizes unicorns do indeed exist. 5 stars for the audio experience:Blackstone AudioRead by Simon Prebble"

406,Laura,"Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimeters inside your skull.I first read 1984 in 1984. I would have been 14 or 15, but I remember it vividly. The smell of boiled cabbages in Winston's apartment building, hiding from the telescreen to write in his diary, Julia's sash, Winston and Julia watching a woman hang up clothes, and Room 101. I wanted to re-read it to see if it would have a different effect on me and if my memories of it were accurate. I was surprised at how much of it I remembered. Reading it knowing the main twists and turns of the plot actually made me more aware of the foreshadowing in the book and made it that much more meaningful. There are a few parts that lag a bit and a few things that seemed somewhat contrived in order to teach the reader. But overall, I thought the writing was fantastic and the ideas the book threw at you were incredibly interesting. I was pulled into the story very quickly, which is always great.The book is a psychological rollercoaster and it is an intense and amazing ride."

His scathing descriptions of people, society and flawed thinking sometimes made me laugh in the midst of very unlaughable scenarios and I would find myself reading them aloud to friends so they could appreciate it.Those moments aside however, the story and the concepts are mind-blowing and creepy, especially since some of the concepts are definitely reflected in today's society and politics.

""Un mundo de miedo, de ración y de tormento, un mundo de pisotear y ser pisoteado, un mundo que se hará cada día más despiadado.""
Si usted no ha leído este libro, no deje de perder el tiempo y póngase a eso.¡Genial! Eso y mucho, muchísimo más. Este libro fue mucho con demasiado. No voy a decir que es uno de esos libros todo lindos de mucha alegría, pero es un libro que te hace pensar tanto que imagino que tu cerebro termina sudando como lo hizo el mío.Sin dudas, es aplaudible la forma en que Orwell creó un mundo tan absolutamente distinto a partir de uno conocido y, luego de mostrarnos las colosales diferencias, nos demuestra las múltiple similitudes. La verdadera crítica del poder, de la segregación de clases y todo lo que se relacione con ello.El Partido logró hacer algo que, si no lo lees, puedes parecer casi imposible: crear una psicosis colectiva, hacer que todos percibieran la realidad de una manera distinta, suprimir el sentido común y las ganas de pensar. Uno de esos libros de los cuales uno siempre escucha hablar y decir maravillas y que, cuando por fin experimentas de qué se trata, to' eso le queda corto."
410,Matty-Swytla,"Orwell is a master. This book is not something you read lightly – it is such a cautionary tale and I’m mad at the entertainment industry for taking his concept of Big Brother and making a mediocre show out of it. What he has in mind is not something you make fun of. Big Brother is not a person but a concept, a multitude of eyes and minds constantly controlling you, observing and censuring your every move, every thought. From external control the concept slowly but surely upgrades to internal control that is subconscious in time. Isn’t this terrifying? 1984 is a superb and chilling portrayal of a totalitarian world. Everything, and I mean everything, is controlled by the government. There are cogs in place in this bureaucracy for every human instinct – love, freedom, friendship. They grind you down until you go mad and embrace the tyranny wholeheartedly. There is no escape from the all-seeing eye of the government. If you believe for a moment that you are free, you are deceiving yourself. Children are used to spy on and betray parents. They are terrifying little monsters that are brainwashed form infancy to be completely loyal to the big idea of the state. No actual independent thought passes their minds since they are drunk on the power they now wield over parents and adults who used to control their behaviour or command them. Ugh... no please.It was such a horror to read this book and to imagine being stuck in such a system. Of course, today’s world is almost as crazy as the one described here. Don’t believe me? Just watch a few good and reputable documentaries regarding the big industries – whether it is the sugar content in our food, the drugs you take, the censorship of the media, or anything else and you’ll see that freedom of speech, the right to know if what you’re eating may harm your health, is a damn fragile thing and under constant pressure from the big money. Deceptions abound; just think of the latest big case – the Volkswagen scandal. Thankfully, while our world may hush things up, eventually things come to light, even if it is too late for some people. In 1984 there is no escape and people who know the truth choose to embrace their privileges and leave the rest of humanity in the dust. So much for altruism and humanitarian impulses...History in particular is subject to continuous re-explanations in 1984, not that people haven’t tried with the Holocaust and Evolution in our societies. The suffering of Roma during the Nazi occupation of Europe was almost forgotten and only now we get to hear some of the horrendous accounts. 1984 explains in details why history is important, why facts and literacy matter. We follow the life of one bureaucrat in charge of editing history – in particular newspapers from the past. What eventually happens to him is just heartbreaking. Read it when you’re in the mood for the book. It demands some nerves of steel."
411,Myoungjee,"SPOILER ALERT :D Review of 1984. 1984 by George Orwell, is a story that shows how much the world can become cruel if one dominates the whole country, with unbearable consequence and betrayals slammed to whom wonder too deeply into the society. This book may be fiction but in someway it still has the open chance that in future this book may become a reality. While reading this book, it kept of reminding me of Adolf Hitlers actions, once the most famous totalitarian utopia of domination across nearly the entire Europe. Only this time, in the novel it was a complete totalitarian country. Total grasp on love, desire, and privacy. Torture for the questioning people and prize to the ones who follow blindly. George Orwell did the perfect job to make readers clench their hearts and be relieved living under a society that provides the least freedom for themselves. Though out the story I could sort many different messages Orwell was trying to continuously slam the readers - The danger of control and dominations that can easily become the destruction of our own self-awareness and ideology eventually to the whole humanity. He slowly introduces the plot of the story and drags readers to become the protagonist, immediately hammering how wrong the situation was in the book and unlocking hints of the message. Rebellions always tend to happen if people cannot bare the system. This book may explain why there were no rebellions during the dominations of the Natzi.As said earlier my favorite parts were when the author astonishingly describes many ways to mind wash and if necessary, break a person in all ways possible. The protagonist named Winston, had attributes to question and defy his daily life out of the eyes of big brother. This book will explain why and how a rebellious man can transform into a loyal subject of Big Brother. Readers will try to resist the situation given and submit before the story line until they finally admit that the reality that we are living in is a blessed situation. Here are some of the quotes that explain this book. The 3 slogans mentioned multiple times in the book will defy what you have learned till today, is crushed once you read this. “WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH “2 + 2 = 5 You may scratch your head if you see this. Of corse the answer is 4. Read and understand how pain can miserably betray your very own self. “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.”Introducing the ultimate way to control the whole power. Look twice and realise the importance of learning history. After reading this book, I give this a 5 out of 5. Any young adult + who wants to know what will happen if one becomes dominate, how the desire of power make this world cruel would be recommended to read this book. Noting that there are minor physical and mental tortures contained."
412,Dawn,"First read this in (the actual year) 1984. Required reading at my high school. It is gloomy and depressing but I never forgot it, and as I got older, I could see so many freakish similarities to our current way of life. I remember thinking ""No way"" when reading about Big Brother and the telescreens (wall screens that interacted with you and watched every move you made). Um, has anyone noticed that with everything from security cameras on the street, everyone with cameras on their phones, the Patriot Act, Xbox Live, Comcast, hulu, Netflix, etc. keeping track of everything we purchase, watch, how we spend our time, etc., WE HAVE NO PRIVACY. Shoot, even our grocery stores keep track of every single thing we buy. Facebook keeps track of every keystroke and sells it to other companies so they can market their wares to us. Not to be an alarmist but to an extent we are living it, people. : ) This is a definite must read for everyone.""And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed-if all records told the same tale-then the lie passed into history and became truth. 'Who controls the past' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.'""- George Orwell, 1984, Chapter 3"
413,Laura Marin,"I don't even know how to describe this book. It is the kind of book which has the power to rip your heart out of your chest while your mind tries to deny what has just happened...  I still have a hard time accepting the end of this book. George Orwell managed to portray the totalitarian regime in such a realistic way that when I reached the end of the book I could not and did not want to accept the conclusion. It was too harsh for my poor little soul...and...well, this is exactly what this book is about.  Orwell's book addresses problems like the definition of human nature, of hope, of death, power and more than anything else, freedom.  He also emphasizes the importance of words in expressing our thoughts and how language can affect our way of thinking. It's an overwhelmingly good book... It's that kind of book you can read a thousand times, even though you never re-read books, because there's so much meaning in every single well-chosen word and so many things to discover on every single little page.P.S: You know a book is really depressing when you would have been extremely happy if the main characters would've just died.P.S.S: This review doesn't even cover 1% of that book SO GO READ IT IT'S AMAZING TRUST ME P.S.S.S I AM REALLY SERIOUS"

415,Daniel Gonçalves,"Nunca fui apologista de “leituras obrigatórias”, e é com desdém que observo o que se faz no sistema de ensino. O ministério decide o que o jovem deve ou não deve ler. Esta é talvez uma das razões para o generalizado desinteresse pela literatura.Após ter lido “1984”, abri uma exceção à minha filosofia. Ler esta obra revela-se importante. Com “1984”, George Orwell não se limita meramente a narrar uma história ficcional. Lança um desafio ao leitor, fazendo-o questionar a sua própria realidade . É esta característica que provavelmente o distingue dos demais. É este facto que o torna universal.	 Em “1984”, escreve com uma prosa límpida, clara e humana. No entanto, não se esmera pela descrição icónica, pela insurgência de imagens. Na verdade, o texto “ensaísta” é o forte do escritor.Ao contrário de outros contadores de histórias, o britânico gosta de focar-se na enumeração dos factos e dos argumentos a favor e contra a sua tese. 	O tema do romance é o totalitarismo e todas as suas consequências quando aplicado numa sociedade. Mas reduzi-lo a isto pode assasinar o propósito para o qual foi escrito. No fundo, o ponto preponderante da obra tende a ser a sua componente racional. Esta engloba uma amálgama de assuntos que vão desde o confronto dos vários ideiais políticos à crítica exacerbada do comunismo. 	A razão pela qual apoio a leitura obrigatória desta obra incontornável da literatura é apenas uma. Ao lê-la, e acima de tudo ao compreendê-la, o jovem adquire a noção da cilada em que se irá encontrar, na idade adulta. Encarnará um espírito , não mítico, mas crítico. Infelizmente, para combater a mediocridade cultural do cidadão comum é necessário um esforço muito maior que este. Para estancar a ignorância, nada melhor que atacá-la nas suas raízes. Próximo passo: estimular o espirito crítico, não a competição pelas notas ( escolar e mais tarde monetárias)."

417,kimyunalesca,"Big brother is watching you!(reminds me of the reality show full of tasks and rewards that turns ordinary folks into instant celebrities coming out of the house way back in the day)It took me awhile to get into it. I'm really grateful I got hold of the audiobook.This is such a classic!it's really good and I love how it somewhat reflects what's happening nowadays or so we don't really know(unaware of),no power to,us being such a drone...it scares me! truly very enlightening!"
418,Iggy De vera,"WAR IS PEACE.FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.""Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me""These two statements were the phrases that stung me as I closed the book after finishing it in two days. Quite honestly, I was not very certain as to what I should have be feeling. A mixture of wanderlust, inspiration, disgust, happiness, laughter and even horror engulfed my mind over the course of the novel...The metaphysical and political aspects of the book are it's strong points however highlighting it's horrifying yet prodigious mechanical utopian ideals. The attention to details in this dystopian novel clearly presents itself through the author's the construction of language, culture, ""modern war"", economy and structure. Totalitarian belief through established systems is not only captured through the established protocol such as the ""telescreen"", but also the imposition of power through psychologicaly degrading means. Considering these factors, this book is absolutely brilliant. It definitely deserves the reputation it is given. "
419,Kristofer Hughes,"“1984” is a dystopian novel written by George Orwell in 1948, and follows Winston Smith, a man who lives in the country of “Airstrip One,” the bombed-out and destabilized remains of Britain under the control of Oceania, one of the three world superpowers that controls its citizens through propaganda and threats of execution for opposing them. Smith despises Oceania, which uses the symbol of a man called “Big Brother” as warning to its complete watch over the population’s actions, and wanders through his life aimlessly until meeting Julia, a woman who reveals to him that she is a member of the resistance to Big Brother and Oceania, and recruits him to their fight. The plot is interesting due to an almost complete lack of conflict, with only Winston’s tirades against Big Brother and the omnipotent security watching every citizen as the major actions, and strives to show an oppressive society from a civilian point of view. “1984” is a mix of the influences of the political climate at the time and dystopian themes, providing a look into the tension between all nations after World War II has ended and the Cold War has begun after, and how it is expressed in the novel. Like “Animal Farm,” Orwell’s book is his take on the political situation at the time of writing and his views of the world itself. “1984” is written in a stunted, daydreaming, and half-focused style, with obscure metaphors and references to the history leading up to the events of it, providing a mix of first and third person as the world is examined through Winston’s eyes. Events are frequently interrupted by reflections of Smith’s memories, violent scenarios he plays through his head, and his opinions on Big Brother and Oceania, showing how emotionally arrested he and all other characters are in the oppressive society of the book. The history in the book’s universe is extremely deep and well-written, with an almost complete compilation of the events leading to Smith’s situation and the forming of Big Brother hidden inside the text. After the first third of the book, however, the plot falters with a flat middle that has almost no major events, and only regains its footing during the final parts, which provides an unflinching look into the effects of propaganda and brainwashing on people, and leaves the story off with a bleak ending on the reality of society, war, and people. “1984” laid ground for all future dystopian works, and remains an excellent literary work to this day, showcasing both excellent writing and setting that puts the reader into city of London and under the rule of Big Brother with complete believability. "
420,Trina,"Potential, vague spoilers Originally published in the 1940s, I think 1984 highlights some of the political feelings of that time period, and especially how emerging technologies could be misused in the future. Even in the present day, the book, set in a ""future"" 30 years ago, is still politically relevant, maybe more so now because of the rate of technological expansion and the plethora of new smart technologies coming on to the market and being made commercially available. We basically live our lives online at the moment, with tumblr and facebook and twitter and youtube, to name a few of the popular social medias. It isn't a stretch to think that these technologies, along with computers and smart phones, could eventually be turned back around to control us, instead of being used to document our lives. These technologies are becoming so ingrained in our day to day lives that it wouldn't be impossible for some overreaching political party or leader to attempt to turn that on the general population. And so, a book from sixty years ago, set thirty years in the past, is still hugely relevant today.The world in which Winston Smith lives in is terrifying, and relevant. All dystopian futures have a hold in the present climate, and 1984 is no different. We can imagine ourselves in Oceania, after some terrible events. We sympathise with Winston's predicament, and his beliefs and values. We root for him, we want him to win. Winston isn't an overly special character, there isn't anything about him to endear him to us. He isn't young, he isn't attractive, he isn't strong, he isn't weak, he doesn't find strength, he doesn't ""save the world""; he isn't anything like the popular heroes and heroines of today's dystopian novels (think the popular trope of YA heroines, like Katniss or Tris, who lead big, life changing adventures to bring down their societies). Maybe the fact that he is unsuccessful is what is important about 1984. He tries, and he fails, and ultimately, he could be any one of us, and he is interchangeable; he could be any of his comrades, and likely is. The writing is engaging, the society is amazingly complex, and the plot line draws you in, and the twist hooks you, if you weren't already hooked. You may be disappointed in the ending, you may not, but regardless, the ending is important. And let's face it, stories aren't always supposed to make you feel warm and fuzzy. Bad things happen in life, bad things can certainly happen in awful, dystopian futures. And maybe Winston is an underrated character, with nothing special about him, but characters don't have to be strong and amazing to be great literary characters. I'm a little sad at the moment actually, because I never read books like this in high school, so I never analysed a book like this at school, and 1984 would be a great book to study. 1984 is definitely a book that everybody should, at least try to, read. "
421,Thomas Llama,"I personally like to think of 1984 as a love story - a tragic, hopeless, pitiful love story between a man who dimly remembers a better time and a girl who could have never envisioned another. Doomed to fail, doomed for death, and indeed, doomed to have their very humanity stripped away, these two are sentenced to damnation for the crime of being who they know they are - human beings.The book, for those who have not yet enjoyed it, is not a difficult read. The plot moves swiftly, leading the reader through the contrasts of daily life as a member of the Party, the wilderness where he has his tryst with Julia, the apparent (and short-lived) ""freedom"" of their rented room, and it's agonizing, disturbing conclusion. ""If you want a vision of the future,"" Orwell writes, ""imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever."" While many have used varied and assorted descriptions for this work, most all of them accurate in various ways, it's a love story. A sad and depressing love story, a love story which takes place in the worst of times, without hope or sanity, where there is no happy ending and the ultimate fate they fear is guaranteed. You will close the book knowing there must be thousands of such love stories, all ending the same way, and you will wonder why man is the monster he truly is."
422,Serkan,"Gece olmasaydı gündüz diye bir kavram olur muydu? Karşılaştırabileceğiniz bir geçmiş ve bir referans noktanız yoksa bugünü nasıl sorgulayabilirdiniz? Kitap geçmişin yönetildiği, düşüncelerinizin esir alındığı bir Dünya'da geçiyor. Bazıları kitabı Stalin dönemi ile özdeşleştirmiş. Ama bence kitap o kadar ağır bir eleştiri içeriyor ki, değil Stalin ya da Hitler, hiçbir yönetim şekli ile ifade edilmemeli. Bu daha çok bir kıyamet senaryosu, insanlığın bittiği, fikir özgürlüğünün sadece özgür olmasının bir işe yaramayacak olanlara verildiği ve işin en kötü tarafı bütün bunların saklanmadığı, herkesin bilinçli bir şekilde sistemi kabullendiği bir kabus. Bu kitap benim gerçek tarihe olan merakımı bir kez daha perçinledi. Eğer belli bir dönem öncesine ait hiçbir kitabı okuyamıyorsak (çünkü dilimizi değiştirdiysek), çevirilerinde nelerin sansürlendiğinden emin olamıyorsak ve şimdiki tarih kitaplarının hepsi devrimi pekiştirmek için devrimi yapanlar tarafından yazılmış ise, gerçek geçmişe nasıl ulaşabiliriz? Sonuç olarak, kitapla ilgili söylenecek bir söz yok, konuya ve esere çok aşina olduğu belli olan çevirmen Celal Üster ise çok iyi bir iş çıkarmış. 5 yıldızı 64 yıl önceden haketmiş bir eser. "
423,Citizen ,"‘’Qui contrôle le passé, contrôle le futur ; qui contrôle le présent, contrôle le passé ‘’ c’est l’idée qui adopte le Parti pour garder le pouvoir éternellement dans l’Océania. Angsoc est le régime de l’Océania, l’un des trois grands blocs qui dirigent le monde dans les années cinquante. Ce régime policier et totalitaire a crée une légende : BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU grâce aux télé-écrans installés partout personne ne peut lui échapper. Toutes les pensées sont minutieusement surveillées par la Police de la Pensée.George Orwell décriait en ""1984 "" un monde déchiré de la guerre et de la famine, un monde où on doit oublier son passé avec tous ses souvenirs, croire et obtempérer à tout ce que dise le Parti. Tout individu doit véritablement aimer le père suprême du Parti BIG BROTHER, chose que Winston Smith n’a pas pu l’accepter.Winston croise Julia lors des deux minutes de la haine, un rituel quotidien du parti, elle lui avoue être amoureuse de lui. Ils s’aiment, font l’amour clandestinement et partagent leur haine envers le Parti, après ce « crime de pensée » les deux amoureux ne peut retourner en arrière ils décident de rejoindre la Fraternité, organisation de résistance secrète supposée être dirigée par Goldstein l’ennemie du Parti. Après leurs arrestations, commence un processus de torture psychique et psychologique dont Winston perd toutes ses convictions morales et accepte des vérités contradictoires notamment (2 + 2 = 5). Dans la pièce 101 il se trouve devant sa phobie, les rats, où il va trahir Julia. C’était la dernière étape de sa « rééducation » avant de lui relâcher. Peu de temps après sa rencontre avec Julia, Winston se rend compte qu’il lui déteste et aime BIG BROTHER. A ce moment, La balle longtemps attendue lui entrait dans la nuque.En monde d'aujourd'hui et l’essor qui connue la technologie, il est devenu plus facile que jamais de surveiller le mouvement des individus et de limiter leur intimité. Cela veut dire que ce qui se passe maintenant est déjà écrit en 1948 par un prodige qui s’appelle George Orwell. Chapeau bas Monsieur ! "

430,Arne-Jan,"Een van mijn all time favourites, hoewel pas een jaar of drie geleden voor het eerst gelezen. Vreemd eigenlijk, want Animal Farm vond ik ook al geweldig en toen was ik zestien of zo. Ik denk dat het kwam omdat Big Brother zo'n bekende term is geworden, dat ik het idee had het verhaal inmiddels wel te kennen. Toen ik dit boek las was ik met een grote groep vrienden op vakantie en desondanks kon ik echt niet wachten om steeds weer een paar bladzijden te lezen tussen de tripjes, maaltijden en stapavonden door. Dat had ik lang niet gehad. Wat een schitterend en knap boek, tot in de puntjes doordacht met bijvoorbeeld het hele nieuwe woordenboek achterin. Aanrader voor als je 1984 nog niet hebt gelezen: lees meteen erna Mao van Jung Chang, dan zie je hoe profetisch dit boek was en hoe dicht Mao is gekomen bij de verwezenlijking van Orwells schrikbeeld."

433,Guenda Ferri,"Avevo lasciato questo libro a metà qualche mese fa; l'altro giorno, però, ho deciso di riprenderlo e nel giro di pochi giorni l'ho finito. L'avevo lasciato dopo diversi capitoli perché, in quel periodo, non avevo voglia di ambientazioni inquietanti e spaventose. Adesso, però, sono contenta di averlo finito: '1984' è il ritratto di una società soggiogata, priva d'identità, controllata in ogni momento da telecamere e dallo sguardo glaciale del Grande Fratello (non quella merda condotta dalla Marcuzzi, un Grande Fratello serio). Orwell, scrivendo questo libro, si immaginava un 1984 fantascientifico e irrealistico, ma non poi così lontano dalla realtà morale della società dell'84 e di oggi. Almeno, io l'ho intesa così. Una società condizionata dai pensieri degli altri, dove ogni persona deve essere uguale alle altre e dove chi tenta di distinguersi viene riportato bruscamente a una realtà composta da persone prive di identità propria. Non è forse - metaforicamente - ciò che accade nella nostra società, oggi? Involontariamente, tutti noi siamo Winston e Grande Fratello. Un libro da brividi che fa riflettere tanto. "
434,Anka,"I read 1984 with a score of other classics before my literature exam, and found it to be one of my most favorites.1984 is the magnum opus, the holy grail, of the dystopian novel. Like with Animal Farm, which 1984 has many parallels with, George Orwell wrote the novel to make a political statement, and if you know the history behind it, the characters are apparently caricatures of real life figures.The plot built slowly and the writing was relatively simple, with descriptive prose scattered throughout for emphasis, but the world-building and characters were undoubtedly captivating. 1984 tells of a world where independent thought, love, literature, and other beautiful things, are punishable by law. Big brother is always watching. Anyone who goes against him disappears. Traitors lurk around every corner and no one is good - not even the protagonists.They are, however, products of their society, and reading about them going against everything they've ever known, dread pervasive and perpetual, is fascinating. This isn't a story with a big, bombastic revolution, the way modern dystopia like The Hunger Games and Divergent are, but for all its subtleties, it's still very powerful."

439,Negar,وقتی داستان ماجرا معلوم شد، جداً انتظار داشتم آخرش جولیا و وینستون به عنوان قهرمان زن و مرد داستان حرب رو بکشن پایین و دیستوپیا رو به یوتوپیا تبدیل کنن. راستش اینقدر دیستوپیا های همین طوری خوندم که این تقریباً جزء تعریفم از دیستوپیا شده بود. و کتاب دقیقاً به همین خاطر فوق العاده بود. نه فقط پایانش، بلکه متفوت بودنش. هر کسی نمی تونه همچین کاری رو بکنه و همچنین اثری رو خلق بکنه. علاوه بر اون همه چیز رو به شکل عالی ای توصیف کنه که مطمئن بشی درکش می کنی و مثل راوی داستان توی همون موقعیت هستی.من قبل از این کتاب از جرج اورولفقطقلعه ی حیوانات رو خونده بودم. اون یکی به خاطر حالت فابل مانندی که داشت هر چقدرم که خوب بود به پای این یکی نمی رسید. موضوع دیگه ای نثر کتاب و تاثیر گذاری تک تک جملات بود. جمله ی اول، و اون جمله ی خارق العاده ی آخر کتاب احتمالا تا یه مدتی اصلاً از ذهن خواننده بیرون نمیره، و علاوه بر اون خیلی چیزای دیگه...او به برادر بزرگ عشق می ورزید... ترجمه برای خوندن خیلی روون و خوب بود. مشکل اینه که وقتی ترجمه می کنی بعضی وقتا نمی فهمی داستان چیه و هی به مترجم اشکال می گیری، ولی خدا رو شکر این ترجمه به جز بعضی اشکالات کوچیک چیزی نداشت که زمون خوندن آزارت بدن. فقط چیز هایی مثل جمله های خاص اورول یا حتی همون جمله ی اول کتاب خیلی بد تغییر پیدا کرده بودن. نا خود آگاه یاد تاریخ افتادم. اصلاً یادم نمیاد کدوم کشورا ولی انگار سه تا کشور بودن که می خواستن جهانو بین خودشون تقسیم کنن و حتی معاهده رو هم امضا کردن. هر چی فکر می کنم یادم نمیاد کدوم کشورا بودن یا چه سالی بود یا بعدش چی شد، ولی نمی دونم چرا یهو اینقدر همه چیز برام جالب شد.و ناخودآگاه یاد یه فیلمی افتادم که خیلی وفت پیش دیده بودم... The Last Enemy که داستان مشابهی نداشت، ولی پایان اون رو هم به شدت مثل این یکی دوست داشتم.در کل این از همون کتابا بود که دوست داری بهشون بگی شاهکار و به بقیه پیشنهاد کنی بخونن. + می دونستید اورول به خاطر این کتاب جونشو از دست داده؟ برحسب عادت همیشگی قبل از خوندن کتاب یه جستجویی درباره ش تو نت کردم و اینو دیدم. در کل وقتی فهمیدمش با یه احترام دیگه ای کتاب رو می خوندم. :)
440,Von B.,"""By lack of understanding, they remained sane.""I decided to pick a brainfood for once. It is hard for us to get an overview of the society we live in when we are too close from it or worse, caged by it. George Orwell will help us get a different perspective and change our ways of thinking. 1984 entails a modernized society where:WAR IS PEACE,FREEDOM IS SLAVERY,IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.London in 1984 was embraced by totalitarianism, where the ruler is a dictator. Who the dictator is?  Big Brother.""Does Big brother exists like I exist?""""You do not exist.Winston Smith is a member of the party. He is aware of the flaws of his society. Big Brother was rejoiced by his Comrades (what they call their fellow party member), Big Brother was only seen in posters; a mere representation of the inner party, the face of dictatorship but instead of being hated, he was praised. The society is downright twisted that you will mutter why. Their best weapon is not a nuclear bomb or a gun that they can pin into someone who rebels. They found a way on how to cultivate someone's mind. Collective thinking, brain washing. People are brainwashed, histories are changed, statistics on the news are invented, tragedies has twisted facts, pretty much the same things we see on TV nowadays. Winston Smith found a partner, a confidant who also hates the party to guts. Her name is Julia. Julia was born after the revolution. She was taught that sexual intercourse should be plain, not passion driven, it is only a duty to their party; sole purpose: re-population. But to Julia, sex is a political act.Thought Crime""Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows""The psychological manipulation is brutal that they even believed 2+2=5. They have no freedom that even the things that are kept inside their head are bound as crime. A comrade has to believe to everything the party say, usually it is easy but to Winston Smith. The pattern is broken.1984 will boost the relativism in your mind. It is a timely book to read. You can relate the modernized society from Newspeak, a language where less is more. Doublethink, a new way of thinking like everything is an Irony or Metaphor. I gave into this, I have to agree to other reviews, the vibe is realistically creepy. That you can even relate some of his so-called dystopian fiction to modern day reality. "
441,Stuart,"Nineteen Eighty-Four: The most terrifying dystopia of them all(Also posted at Fantasy Literature)Along with Yevgeny Zamyatin’s We (1924) and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World (1932), George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) is the one of the most powerful and important dystopian novels every written, and unquestionably a work of science fiction thanks to its depiction of a future totalitarian regime that controls every aspect of its citizen’s mental and physical existence. It’s hard to imagine any educated person in the English-speaking world who hasn’t heard the terms Big Brother, doublethink, thoughtcrime, and Newspeak, even if they’re not sure exactly what they mean. It’s also likely that many readers were exposed to the book in high school English or Humanities classes, which is a good time to read any important book. I’d say this book has probably had a greater social and political impact than any other work of speculative fiction. Who, after reading it, could possibly see any merit whatsoever in a totalitarian government, even if it governs ostensibly for the good of its citizens? In terms of relevance to today’s world, although the Communist regime of the Soviet Union officially dissolved in 1991, a victim of its own incompetent centrally-planned economic policies and a draining nuclear arms race with the US, there are still totalitarian regimes that control, brainwash, and starve their citizens, devoting all their resources to their military, and thumbing their nose at the rest of the world. That’s right, I’m talking about that country that may or may not have launched a cyber attack on a major US film studio, and that routinely denies reality and keeps its citizens locked in its ideological clutches without mercy or humor. So the dystopian warning of Nineteen Eighty-Four remains alive and well!The story revolves around a minor party bureaucrat named Winston Smith, who spends his dreary days at the Ministry of Truth (in charge of propaganda) continuously revising and redacting historical documents to conform to the ever-changing realities that the Party presents to the public. Whenever an undesirable people has been “vaporized” by the party, their very existence is expunged from all historical records. It takes a certain amount of skill to rewrite events to fit “reality”, but he has some talent for it. One of the key events that he must reintroduce to the past is that Oceania (one of the three superstates that have carved up the world after a global conflict) has changed its enemy from Eurasia to Eastasia, and all related documents must now reflect this. Moreover, thanks to the principle of “doublethink”, loyal citizens are able to believe two contradictory things simultaneously without being disturbed. So anytime the Party announces a new enemy (and that the former enemy is now an ally), this new reality immediately trumps all previous information seamlessly. Then bureacrats like Winston revise the historical documents to reflect this. The other Ministries are the Ministry of Peace (which carries on Oceania’s perpetual war with Eastasia and Eurasia), the Ministry of Plenty (which handles the rationing and shortages of food and supplies), and the Ministry of Love (a spy organization that identifies and eliminates any potential dissidents). The three principles that are written on the ministries’ exteriors are WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, and IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. Again, thanks to “doublethink”, these tenets make perfect sense to the Inner Party (the small elite who dictate policy), the Outer Party (a slightly larger group of bureacrats that execute policy), and the Proles, the remaining 85% who are kept in abject poverty and ignorance to prevent any disobedience or questioning. Again, is this not a perfect description of what we see in North Korea today?The story progresses as Winston meets Julia, another party member working at the Ministry of Truth, and they begin an clandestine love affair, with both discovering a secret hatred of the oppressive Party. Later they are approached a member of the Inner Party, O’Obrien who indicates he’s a member of the underground group called the Brotherhood, dedicated to the downfall of the Party. He reveals the inner workings of the Party’s propaganda machine and asks Winston and Julia to cooperate. Then the Thought Police get involved…I won’t reveal what happens next, but being a dystopian warning to readers, I think you can guess that it doesn’t end Happily Ever After. And if you ever thought that the idea of Big Brother was a bit far-fetched, and that a populace could never be completely brainwashed by propaganda, then you haven’t paid proper attention to our Dear Leader in Pyongyang."

443,Jake Danishevsky,"Very interesting example of despotic society. Big brother is always watching, hence big brother ideal and reality. If the past doesn't agree with current, change the past and change the narrative. We have seem something like this currently and recently over and over. Who said this? ""I didn't set the red line, the world did"", when we all remember who made big statements, ""RED line if Assad uses chemical weapons"". Red line in Chief, Mister Twister!! ""Those who control the past, control the future and those who control the future, control the present"" - 1984. Control is the key word in this novel, but also in reality of such society of ""everyone is or should be equal"".""Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious."" Brilliant quote about proles, the lower element of society who are more concerned about petty items than their livelihood or their past, present or future. A Party slogan ""proles and animals are free"" from this novel is one of the major points that resonate with anyone who is consciously thinking about reality of this fiction. Depending how you measure freedom of course. Everything is relevant and all depends on how you measure freedoms. As this book portrays, but not too fore fetched, for those of us who have actually lived in society designed to break the human spirit, your individual thinking, it is how you make people perceive their reality, their past, present and their freedom. Perception is reality, so if you alter perception, you just changed the reality. I couldn't help by compare this book to ""Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley. The differences are significant, but the underlining fact is the same, that you trade your individual perception of reality for actual freedom. ""Brave New World"" is different in the sense that it portrays a society where everyone is conditioned to be happy, to enjoy what they have, what they do and how they do it, so there is no need for excessive measures and 'tortures', but at the same time, it also portrays the reality of the human will to always think for him/her self. One of the reasons the forced social justice, for ""people's own good"", for the ""good of the society"", could never work. The individual human spirit to have a free will, to love, to hate, to feel and to think. Perfect example is ""Brave New World"" in fiction, but fiction resembles reality. In ""1984"" it is a lot easier to see that the social justice of forced, torturous ""education"", ""conditioning"" and police state, is the actual reality of any social justice forced society. Sure, one might say that it is a fiction, a fairy tale, a myth, but in actuality, except for a few items that technically didn't yet exist in the time of this book, the myth is the theory of ""everyone is equal"" society. Man are not created equally, not in the sense of having the same things, same life, same skills, same talent and same needs. Even if you pretend that everyone can and should be equal, those who pretend and force it, know perfectly well that they are not and never want to be themselves. As George Orwell phrased in his novel ""Animal Farm"", ""All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.""""Ignorance is strength"" - 1984. Brilliant!! There is a great explanation on why and how it is so. Perfect example that the poor, even though promised everything and always given nothing, don't ever change their situation, no matter what some tell them and promise them, they just change their master. Lenin and Soviets through and after revolution proclaimed ""Who was nothing, will be something"". Something what? When you pretend that you will change your situation by relinquishing power to a group of those who work for ""your better good"", you better be sure that those whom are working in your favor have someone, some many, watching over them, because the spirit of humans not wanting to be ""equal"" is the same spirit of those who pretend that they can be, by taking more for themselves and making everyone else miserable...aka social justice...aka ""1984"" and all the societies which are, were and will be based on that ""everyone equal"" principle.This is one great book. Dark, but great!!"
444,Adanma Raymond,"I loved this book but, like every novel, it was not perfect. However, it is hard to criticize such a well-known and appreciated book without coming off as seemingly ignorant or unread, so I won't attempt to delve into the flaws of George Orwell's '1984'. I will say that it is a book that in my opinion, everyone should read.  The novel describes life under a predicted totalitarian regime, where no actions go unnoticed, and privacy no longer exists. Through the eyes of protagonist Winston Smith, Orwell creates an incredibly realistic sense of oppression, which at times left me feeling frustrated and helpless. Each biting description adds to the novel's harsh setting of post-""revolution"" London. Yet within this bland, strict reality, our protagonist finds passion, a passion which is arguably the driving force for the last two sections of the book. In other reviews, readers have argued that the characters are flat and lack any real depth, but I think that our inability to read too much into each character is intentional, adding to the mystery and solitude each citizen of Oceania feels. All details aside, the book is a classic, and definitely a favorite of mine."

446,Phaedra,"I stared at the screen of my computer and deliberated my star rating for a long time. I was caught between four stars and five, but I knew I had to choose one or the other. I decided that 1984 by George Orwell deserved five stars because of the complexity of the idea, how applicable it was to today, and how much it stretched my imagination. This was one of those books that I had to read in absolute silence or I wouldn't understand a single word I read. Once I was totally submerged in reading, I found that my mind was boggled by the different ideas presented in 1984; the idea that stuck out the most to me was the use of language. I believe that the theme of 1984 could be: whoever has control of language has the most power. In the story the government, also known as the Party, had one hundred percent control of the media and written language. The people believed everything the Party said, even if it was a complete lie or contradictory to something they had previously been told. We see the control of language in our lives today just as Orwell predicted. Media shapes our perspective by blowing things out of proportion and exaggerating, but people believe all of the stories anyway. I can only hope that our society never conforms to the use of language as a weapon of the government. "

448,Kayla Thompson,"An absolutely amazing book. It's one of those stories where you want to finish to know what happened, but not finish so you can keep reading it. Orwell wrote this book in 1949. If I was around and read it then, I wouldn't have appreciated it as much as I do now, because the warning he gives his readers are truer. One of my new favorites for sure."
449,Fia Eamónn Wåhlin,"I have heard alot of great stuf about this book, a ""must read""and I must say, I am so NOT disappointed! I can't believe it's written in 1949 because you really can't tell!It's a fictional world, maybe not so fictional if you think about it.. Some elements in it is scarying similar to what could happen and has happened to places around the world. It's a world I would be terrified to live in. and the most scary thing is how well he describes it and as said you really wouldn't know it was written that long ago if you hadn't done your homework. :)It's about Winston Smith and his structured life in England 1984, but in this 1984 England belonged to one of the three big worldstates, Oceania, Where the government ""The Party"" rules through different ministries with an ironhand. And Bigbrother is the face of Oceania under whom everyone should obey.Brainwaching is stadard and every day Winston and the others are taught that War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorence is Strenght.But Winston has doubts, doubts that there is a better world, a world where freedom is natural, and he has memories that such a world has once maybe existed, but the party and Ministry is constantly shouting out words from the tv-monitors that London has always looked like this and other things they wanted the people to believe.Winston finds a kindred spirit and thats's when everything starts..I really loved this book, the best grade for is if it gets you this impressed and makes you think and that's exactly what 1984 brings, and lots of it."
450,Eucaris ,"Oh dios! Probablemente uno de los libros que mas he recomendado, asusta bastante el hecho que la sociedad esta cada día mas cerca de parecerse al escenario de esta historia, es excelente sin duda alguna. "
451,jess,"I first read 1984 when I was in 8th grade in my spare time as extra credit for language arts (not that I needed it - I was *that* kid haha). I read it again in high school thinking maybe I didn't properly grasp the ideas because I wasn't worldly enough yet.. And I found that while I did in fact understand it as a 13 year old, I got so much more out of it the second time. Each subsequent time I've read 1984, I've had the same feeling. The message is the same, but I always seem to have a different experience each time I read it. For this reason and many, maaaaany others, this is one of my favorite books :) "
452,Ellie,"""It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen""So begins George Orwell's dystopian novel, first published in 1949. The World is divided into three super-states: Oceania (the USA, Commonwealth and part of Southern Africa); Eurasia (mainland Europe & the Middle East); and Eastasia (China, Japan and other Far East).Oceania is ruled by Big Brother, and society is split into three social classes: the Upper Party, the elite ruling minority, make up 2% of the population; the Outer Party, c13% of the population, mostly work in the four Ministries that control Oceania; and the Proles (proletariat), c85% of the population, the uneducated who live in poor conditions. Living conditions are generally poor, and every action, every word, every deed is monitored.Winston, a member of The Outer Party from London, principle city of Airstrip One, and a conscientious and skilled worker in the Ministry of Truth, spends his day altering old newspaper reports so that they reflect the current Party line. In Oceania, the past can be changed, wars can be unfought, people can be wiped from trace, and memory, completely - a fate common for those guilty of thought common.But Winston can't forget the past, nor does he want to. He hates Big Brother. He embarks on an affair with a similarly minded co-worker, Julia, and together they seek to join the mysterious underground movement, The Brotherhood. But the Thought Police catch up with them, and so through Winston's eyes we see the real truth behind the Party.Written in the post-war period, there is much wiithin Nineteen Eighty-Four that places it firmly in that era; the three states of Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia corresponding to the emerging post-war 'superpowers' of the USA, the Soviet Union and China, while the Party's adoption of muscular blond youths in it's propaganda raises the spectre of the Third Reich.There are three key points arising from Nineteen Eighty-Four when it is read today. Firstly, the actual story is short and scarcely told, and even then it could have done with some editing. The long sections repeated from the Book issue allegedly by the Brotherhood are more than a little boring, and as the protagonist Winston says, they tell us little we don't already know.But the story is secondary for this novel. The description of life in a dystopian society was, and is, so captivating, so imfluential, that almost 70 years on, many phrases and ideas from the novel are commonly used in everyday language, from the Thought Police to Room 101. Even the Party's leader has given his name to a reality TV show.But more than that, what is so frightening about this novel, is how some things we today are used to is common place in the fictional Oceania. When the Party reports that it has increased the chocolate ration 24 hours after actually reducing it, Winston ponders on how people could,possibly swallow such an obvious lie. But when we think of how spin doctors are today employed to twist stories in much the same way, we begin to see how the Party could maintain control. Meanwhile, it was amusing to read, of Winston, ""He seemed to see a vision of London, vast and ruinous, the city of a million dustbins."" on the same day that UK Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles suggested builders should include areas for the storage of wheelie bins! And then, how many in the UK play the National Lottery? In Oceania, the proles also had a lottery, which, ""with its weekly payout of enormous prizes, was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable that there was some millions of proles thinking the lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive. Where the lottery was concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts and lucky amulets."" There is, I think, some relevance for that statement in the modern world.My favourtie moment in the book, though, has to be the altercation between a pub customer, demanding a pint, and and the barman, reminding the customer that beer was served only in litres and half-litres. Now there's a battle that's still being fought!""The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth."""
453,Abilio,"Orwell, que tinha ""a tese de seu romance encapsulada no coração"" desde 1944, escreveu grande parte de Mil Novecentos e Oitenta e Quatro na ilha de Jura, na Escócia, entre 1947 e 1948, enquantos sofria de um quadro crítico de tuberculose[1:]. Ele enviou o texto final do livro para os editores Secker e Warburg em 4 de dezembro de 1948, e o livro foi publicado em 8 de junho de 1949.Em 1989, Mil Novecentos e Oitenta Quatro já havia sido traduzido para mais de 65 idiomas, mais do que qualquer outro romance de um único autor. O título, os termos, o idioma (Novilíngua) presentes no romance, assim como o sobrenome do autor viraram sinônimo para a perda de privacidade pessoal para a política de segurança nacional de um determinado Estado. O adjetivo ""Orwelliano"" tem muitas conotações. Pode se referir à ação totalitária, assim como às tentativas de um governo em controlar ou manipular a informação com o propósito de controlar, apaziguar ou até subjugar a população. ""Orwelliano"" também pode se referir à fala retorcida que diz o oposto do que realmente significa ou, mais especificamente, à propaganda governamental que dá nomes errados às coisas; no romance, o ""Ministério da Paz"" lida com a guerra e o ""Ministério do Amor"" tortura as pessoas. Desde a publicação do romance, o termo ""orwelliano"" tem, de fato, tornado-se uma espécie de bordão para qualquer tipo de excesso ou desonestidade governamental e, portanto, tem múltiplos significados e aplicações. A frase Big Brother is Watching You (""O Grande Irmão está te observando"") conota especificamente a vigilância invasiva frequente."
454,Courtney,"Undeniably a masterpiece. I was so disappointed in the ending, but Orwell's forewarning argument comes across very well with it. The writing is brilliant along with the concepts which are easily relatable to present day. I think the two things I really liked about this novel were: 1-Winston's stubbornness throughout two thirds of the story and all of the examples of human thought he gives as to why it's still sane if you're a minority of one. I especially loved his description of ""ancestral memory,"" or things humanity does just because they're inherent to do. 2-I am glad Orwell included the excerpts of THE BOOK so that we could read along with Winston these forbidden truths that again are easily compared with and criticize today's government, however capitalist. There are a lot of things that I could specifically relate to, like the pointlessness of some types of labor. I didn't really like Julia's character at all. Winston and she are both rebels but in very different ways, hers being a more teenage runaway rebellion while Winston's is a matter of life and death. Their relationship and how they tried to get along irked me, but it added onto the ""negative utopia"" theme. The torture scenes aren't for the weak hearted. The novel is scary, but it also reaches deeper and asks very important questions about you as a citizen of this world. I would recommend to anyone."
455,Mark Russell,"George Orwell's cautionary tale of a totalitarian state thwarting one man's quest to get laid. A drab but nightmarish world dominated by ""the Party,"" and their revered leader ""Big Brother"" who still legitimizes the Party's rule even though he is long dead, if he existed at all. Sort of like Reagan.On the bright side, every apartment comes equipped with a largescreen interactive TV. The drawback being that the programming consists mostly of mass hangings and exercise programs. And if the TV catches you saying something nasty about Big Brother, policemen come and torture you.As with most monolithic, oppressive regimes, the Party finds it easier to beat and terrorize people into pretending everything's great than it is to actually make them happy and provide for their basic needs. Only the Party takes it one step further, using simulated drowning, burying people alive and confrontations with rats to foment personal psychological breakdowns so people no longer pretend to love the Party, but do so genuinely, if only as a by-product of extreme duress. This is what happens to the protagonist, Winston Smith (oh yeah, spoiler alert).Which begs the question: is this a happy ending? Is being successfully brainwashed into happiness the same as actually being happy? As far as the Party's concerned, the answer is yes. But for those of us who've never had a cage of rats hooked up to our face or otherwise experienced a Come to Jesus moment, it can't help but feel like Winston Smith's love of Big Brother and the Party comes as a form of death."
456,Jacqueline,"I was assigned to read this for my senior summer reading project. Never a fan of Animal Farm and a bad habit of procastinating, I finally started to read it with a little less then two weeks of school left. I had a game plan to read one part in two days. However, I didn't mind the rush. Itt was quite easy to make my deadline; I absolutely loved this book. The society in 1984 is scary. There is no privacy whats-so-ever. Every move you make is constantly scrutinized due to the face that one is constantly watched by telescreens that are everywhere. The idea is freaky and so interesting. If the people in the society aren't brainwashed, then they are putting on a show evey minute of their lives. To show that you are against the way you are living even in the slightest way, you will be punished. Although Winston isn't necessary the most likeable character, I couldn't help but to be drawn into him. And I loved watching his almost robotic exterior change and grow emotion when he writes in the diary and is with Julia. This book has plenty of twists that left me confused and quite angry. *****SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE ON****And the ending.. wow. Throuhout the novel I was waiting for a rebellion, but nothing happens, and with this society.. nothing will ever happen. When I read the last two lines of the novel, my heart completely sunk. Winston was brainwashed. He belives he is ""cured"" and loves The Party and Big Brother. When I read that, I can't say I was surprised. I saw it coming, but the naive side of me liked to believe there was a chance. But when I finished the novel, I couldn't stop thinking about it. That's how you know it is a great book."

459,Beatrice Santos,"Alguma vez imaginaram o que seria viver num mundo onde estamos constantemente a ser observados e julgados? Ah espera lá...?Esta é uma sátira política genial e não podia ser outra coisa vinda de George Orwell, autor de A Quinta dos Animais.
""Big brother is watching you""
Para aqueles que nunca leram o livro, talvez conheçam a famosa frase do programa Big Brother, que ironicamente, é um programa que foi baseado neste livro e em que o conceito geral é ""aprisionar"" pessoas num ambiente completamente controlado e vigiado, com uma figura autoritária (Big Brother).Apesar de acreditar veemente que dar ideias a really shows não era, de forma alguma, a intenção de Orwell ao escrever este livro, a verdade é que este é um conceito aplicável ainda agora, no mundo em que vivemos e, infelizmente, cada vez mais.Esta é uma obra intemporal, de um carácter politicamente filosófico, se é que tal coisa existe e que recomendo a todos aqueles que gostam de reflectir um bocado sobre a sociedade em que vivemos."
460,MJ Nicholls,"So much to be ANGRY about! If you ever conquer your nagging self-hatred, there is a whole world of untamed FURY waiting to be discovered. People—rich ones, conceited ones, selfish ones, hateful ones, abusive ones, thick ones—everyone is a potential GEYSER of rage!Fortunately, your self-hatred is strong for now, otherwise you would have to confront the wankers in suits who snubbed the homeless outside the bank, leaving downtrodden debtors to fit the bill; or the woman who strutted with self-regarding arrogance along the pavement; or the smirking busker who strummed crap indie covers outside the library who was probably a middle-class cock named Tim up from his country estate to slum it in a well-appointed Blackford flat while at uni before taking a managerial role in his father’s corporation; or the single mother whose only purpose in life was to push her spawn around by saying their names over and over in a shrill English accent until they erupted in bus-consuming screams; or the old men who stumbled out pubs and staggered to the betting shop, forever trapped in cycles of mindless gambling and alcohol consumption as though art, music, books didn’t exist and the world was one bronchitic catarrhy wheeze-cough; or the billboards for unfunny comedies with wax-faced gurning hasbeen multi-zillionaires; or the people who walked through life blissfully unaware of the contempt and indifference with which they were treated by the corporations that took their money to butcher penguins and pauperise small businesses and abuse starving children in third-world sweatshops so everything looked nice in the display window; or the perpetually corrupt chav-baiting governments that took backhanders from devil-fucking corporations that ruled the world by exploiting and bending the law to make their wallets fatter, dishing out lies whenever convenient to flatter the stakeholders’ greed; or the impudent people from all walks of life so bound up in their own petty needs and wants they would never think to lift a finger to help anyone, or who begrudged giving the tiniest morsel to charity because the self-pleasure impulse was so strong it inconvenienced them to have to dig into their pockets; or the people who filled themselves up with soulless entertainment like commercial pop music and defended their right to pollute the world with their tastes at the expense of suppressing all art with proper value with the capacity to move people in deep heart-shattering ways through hard-wrought artistry, not cheap sentiment; or an interminably dreary future of call centre dystopias where everyone is programmed to deliver peerless customer service and hawk tat for bonuses; or a world akin to ancient Egypt where the cat is venerated over all humans and more deserving of our attention than genocide, famine, war, drought, ecological disasters, and so on; or a world where INDIFFERENCE and GREED were so rampant there wasn’t even a good reason to drag one’s weary carcass out of bed in the morning to face it all again.So many things to get ANGRY about! How do you even begin to cope with all that?! "
461,Martina Hlúbiková,"This book is marvelous, but unfortunately reminds so much of reality, it says about the politics and the behavior of people. Many people say that this book is about communism but if you read it carefully you will see that it resembles present very well. This book is trying to say that any totality regime, including communism is unnatural. It's unbelievable how can a party of people control everything in the world from books, music, TV to minds and thoughts of people.Winston Smith is a facilitator rather than a major figure in 1984. He describes the system and shows how it works in Oceania, and what happens to a man when he stands against the party and is dedicated. If you like happy endings for sure you should avoid this novel on the other hand it would be a pity.Party slogans e. g. “He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.” and especially “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.” completely describes the world today .Society determines how a person thinks and how should live . Man eventually begins to believe that the more times repeated lie becomes the truth. Influenced by the constant pressure, a person stops believing their own memories , nor common sense. In this book it is clear to see the class stratification of society and the impact of industrialization on living of individual. Orwell except social, class and political issues also tries to solve the language issue , namely that the language will determine the thinking . Narrowing the vocabulary we reduce our ability to express and think in a manner which is against the party. 1984 is an excellent book that forces the reader to think about the world in which we live and how we allow entities to influence us . I recommend this novel to everyone. "
462,Ricardo Mota,É mais um ensaio do que um romance. Como romance não é grande coisa. Como ensaio é brilhante na visão utópica daquilo a que pode chegar a sociedade e da leitura que faz em torno disso.Acho-o obrigatório para se compreender a política e a sociedade actual e sobretudo para que nunca se caia nisto... já faltou mais!
463,Alexandra Bears,"1984 is a doubleplusgood book. To help you fully understand the principles of newspeak before you read 1984 look in the appendix which should have a couple pages explaining newspeak. I liked 1984 because it was a true dystopian, not like other books where everything gets resolved by the will of one character. 1984 explains what an ultimate fascist state would be like. This book shows that blind loyalty isn't a good thing. The characters have the ability to accept the things the party tells them as truth, no matter what. The book itself is right on the edge of satire but contains enough truth to frighten modern day citizens. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy dystopias."
464,Marija S.,I re-read the book (re-listened actually in a very recommendable version I found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NayX...) and can only say this one is nothing short of brilliant. 
465,Ricardo Alcaraz," 1984 is one of those books that when you pick up, you cannot put down. It was weird since I haven't had many moments like that since not many things actually captivate me. This is a novel written by George Orwell decades ago that still manages to be relevant today.  The story takes place in Oceania where everything is controlled by the government who calls themselves Big Brother. Big Brother is always watching you and always keeping you in check. No one is allowed to have their own opinion, and in doing so you will be called in for thought-crime. They manipulate kids to work for them and they manage to keep everyone scared. They rewrite history at will to make it seem like they were the good guys throughout history. They try to simplify the dictionary as the generations pass to keep people ignorant. It's a bleak and depressing world that must be absolute hell to live in. The main character is Winston Smith who works for Big Brother. He's a lowly individual who rewrites the history books as Big Brother sees fit. He has a burning hatred toward them but he can't do anything about it. Without spoiling anything, he finds a girl who shares some of his views and he falls in love. That's as far as I can go without spoiling the rest of the story. The ending will probably surprise you as it's quite sad. This is one of the few books that will easily stand against the test of time. Even though the book was written decades ago, it's even more relevant now than ever before. I loved this book and I think it should be a book that everyone reads at least once."
466,Brice Meerman,"I will not review this novel. Although extremely thought provoking, I would need to write a dissertation to properly review this wonderful scary novel. I would say a must read (even still today) for any political thinker, sci-fi liver, historian, and or plane reading enthusiast. Loved it. I'm absolutely ashamed I hadn't read this earlier in life. "
467,Rhonda Paglia,I've read this book many times over the years and have loved it each time! Highly recommended - thought provoking - creepy - futuristic - and always leaves me thinking - is this where we are headed as a society? 
468,Bernarda Araya,"Me costó un mundo poder terminar este libro, y no porque fuera lento, ni malo, de hecho es solo porque soy tan estúpida como para ignorar el libro solo porque me hablan por las redes sociales. 1984, es uno de los mejores libros que pude haber leído hasta ahora... George Orwell tuvo una idea tan genial y fantástica, que al poder leerla al fin solo hizo que mi me te explotara. Muchas cosas en este libro, son tan ciertas, ¿cómo es que los seres humanos hemos dejado de ser humanos? Y piénsenlo bien. ¿Cómo es que este hombre pudo pensar tanto en lo que podría ocurrirle a nuestra humanidad en un futuro? Se con mucha claridad que no es literalmente todo lo que está en el libro cierto y comparativo al día de hoy. Pero si se ponen a pensar un poco, a comparar la más mínima cosa, fijarse en frases... Está totalmente transparente que muchas cosas ocurren hoy en día.Este libro merece definitivamente 5 estrellas y espero seguir leyendo más libros de este mismo autor."
469,Cecilia Boyers,AMAZING want to reread
470,Negar Ghadimi,با خود اندیشید که بهترین کتاب آن است که دانسته های آدم را برایش نقل می کند.----------------------------------------------------گاهی آدم را با چیزی تهدید می کنند، چیزی که تابِ ایستادگی در برابرش را ندارد، فکرش را هم نمی تواند بکند آن وقت می گوید: این کار را با من نکنید، با شخصِ دیگری بکنید، با فلان و بهمان! و شاید بعد ها وانمود کند که حقه ای بیش نبوده، آن را سوار کرد که جلوشان را بگیرد و از صدقِ دل بر زبانش نیاورد، ولی کور خوانده! از صدقِ دل بر زبانش می آورد ...----------------------------------------------------درد همیشه به تنهایی کفایت نمی کند. مواردی هست که انسان تا سرحدِ مرگ درد را تحمل می کند. اما برای هر آدمی چیزی غیر قابلِ تحمل وجود دارد. چیزی که در حوصله ی اندیشه نمی گنجد. این جا دیگر پای شهامت و بزدلی در میان نیست ...
471,Apurva Shukla,"This book is an absolute classic! It is basically a dystopian novel where the main character (Winston Smith) lives in. It is set in 1984 (obviously), and the world's countries are divided into three superstates with each having their own totalitarian government and their own doctrine. Through this novel, Winston faces hideous truths behind this all knowing, all loving Big Brother and his Party. From the moment you are born in this world, you are subjected to endless propaganda and watched carefully to see if you show any signs of straying from the chosen path (which is following Big Brother). If for any instance a person thinks about anything bad about Big Brother (such as his downfall) they disappear, with their history removed from every record. In this world, he who controls the past controls the future, he who controls the present controls the past. The novel is written with such amazing craftsmanship, and so it wasn't surprising that I was instantly drawn into this meticulously woven story. Absolutely would recommend to everyone, this is a book everyone must read before they die :) WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH"

473,Nicholas Karpuk,"It's intimidating to comment on a book that's been the subject of so much discussion. People have been throwing around the term ""Big Brother"" as long as I can remember, but I've wondered for years how accurate the usage actually was.I read 1984 on audiobook, and I have to admit it felt like cheating. The main issue is there were so many ideas worth remembering that I may be forced to by a hardcopy so I can flip through it highlighting memorable passages.Most often people mention Big Brother in the context of surveillence, which is really short sighted compared to what Orwell was saying. It's not about the cameras, the cameras are actually a moot point. The government could take you at any time, essentially on a whim, or a suspicion. Cameras were merely a reminder that they could watch you if they felt like it, that they could back up their suspicions if necessary.There's a bitter relevance to much of the text, because to me it basically an essay on the nature of bullies, and what happens when they're allowed to run any government for too long.A friend of mine read the book around the same time, and was upset at how bleak the ending was, since the villain of the story essentially wins. The beauty of Orwell's conclusion is that it doesn't allow you to feel smug. All of the protagonists high ideas are bashed into the ground ruthlessly and he's left broken.You have to create your own counter-argument to Obrien's belief that Big Brother is the correct lifestyle.My main counter argument is that no matter how bright a despot is, they can not all pick equally powerful successors. All evil men die, and their replacements are often weaker, derivative versions of their appointer. No state of oppression is indefinite by sheer virtue of man's mortality.That's the beauty of the novel, it demands that you think about what it's saying, it provokes and does nothing to soothe the blow, it doesn't supply answers to its questions, it builds you up, knocks you down, and leaves you to pick yourself up again.If you ever throw around the term ""Big Brother"", or are at all concerned about tyranny both at home and abroad, you owe it to yourself to read ""1984""."

479,Ana Isabel,"A obra de George Orwell retrata uma sociedade distópica em que todos os detalhes da vida de cada indivíduo eram controlados. Assim, é-nos fácil admitir que o tema central da história é a falta de liberdade e as inúmeras consequências que isso tem nas pessoas.Gostei bastante da personagem principal, Winston, e da sua perspicácia e resignação quanto aos lemas apregoados pelo Partido. Achei muito interessante o facto de ele manter sempre a sua memória a funcionar a cem por cento para que as alterações que o Partido realizasse no passado não alterassem também as suas recordações. A história manteve-me constantemente interessada, não pela existência de mistérios que se resolviam no desenrolar das páginas (como nos meus adorados policiais) mas porque eu queria desesperadamente descobrir se Winston teria a coragem de tomar uma atitude ou se seria, infelizmente, apanhado. Detestei, no entanto, a sua atitude no final. Por fim, posso dizer que gostei muito deste livro e que estou contente por ter tomado a iniciativa de o ler. Reconheço que foi necessária muita imaginação (afinal, ele criou uma mapa mundi propositadamente para a história) e confesso também que determinados excertos me deixaram com medo que isto pudesse verdadeiramente acontecer. Não é impossível.Aconselho a leitura desta obra a todo o tipo de leitores, mesmo os que não gostam muito de ler. "
480,Emma Arnold,"Definitely a book I will need to revisit at some point in the future. So glad I never had the ending spoiled, and was reading this for the first time completely ignorant to what was going to happen. "
481,Leyendoenelbus,"Magnífico. Brutal. Impresionante. Gris y duro, pero merece la pena su lectura"
482,Marty Ross,"This was my second time reading this book, having read it maybe 15 years ago. Even the first time, it struck me as a great endictment of totalitarianism, but then I was just out of high school and did not understand the historical context it was written in. I decided to re-read it because North Korea was in the news, and if the dystopic horror show depicted in the book has ever been brought into being, it's in North Korea. I have to say, wow. It's been a long time since I've read something that moved me like this book did. It is for books like this that my ratings usually top out at 4.5. I can leave room for the books that are masterpieces.Of course that's not the only reason this book is relevant to today's world. This book represents a possible end-game to modern society. How can we ever get to a sustainable world? Well, this is one way: keeping population down, keeping production down, and stagnating the society in an inescapable rut.I recommend this book to all who have not read it, and especially to those who might ot have read it for some time. A little more knowledge and experience make this an even more eye-opening read."
483,charlie,"I found myself re-reading (and falling back in love with) George Orwell’s dystopian classic, Nineteen Eighty-Four. The first time I read this, I was fifteen or so, in high school. My English lit teacher had told the class about Orwell’s eerie prediction of the future of human civilisation, ruled by a totalitarian government and completely surveilled in every aspect. This, naturally, intrigued me and I had to read it. Whilst it’s important to remember that Nineteen Eighty-Four is a very political story; a depressing, no-nonsense truth of how the human mind can be manipulated and controlled beyond even one’s own willpower, it’s also important to remember that, like all great books, it’s a tragic love story that frustrates and saddens and elates you. All at once.If you haven’t read it yet, what the hell are you waiting for?"
484,Sonja,"Books that make you think all the way through them are probably the best kind. 1984, BB, Winston, O'Brien & their world did exactly that. Fascinating, from beginning to end...From listlessness & grey to quasi- eutopia to torture, everything was exactly as it should be. "
485,eleonora - ,"“Nulla vi apparteneva, se non quei pochi centimetri cubi che avevate dentro il cranio.” 1984 è un libro che va digerito. Non è una lettura d'evasione e non è neanche un libro piacevole nel senso comune del termine. Non conosce un lieto fine, non conosce momenti di vera gioia e anche la speranza non viene mai sola, ma sempre accompagnata dal terrore e dalla certezza di un futuro dal quale non si può sfuggire.Ogni desiderio, ogni pensiero libero, ogni parola, persino ogni legge fisica è annullata, cancellata da quello che il Partito ha deciso.“Perfino quando si usa la parola bipensiero è necessario ricorrere al bipensiero. Nel farne uso, infatti, si ammette di manipolare la realtà, ma con un novello colpo di bipensiero si cancella questa consapevolezza, e così via, all'infinito, con la menzogna in costante posizione di vantaggio rispetto alla verità.” 1984 trascina in un mondo impossibile, ma probabile. Un mondo dal quale non si può che rimanere spaventati, terrorizzati, esterrefatti mentre si leggono con sguardo incredulo pagine di un qualcosa che non vorremo mai che avvenisse.George Orwell era uno scrittore di sinistra di forte ispirazione marxista. Le sue speranze verso la rivoluzione e il regime comunista cadono in frantumi non solo con il comunismo sovietico, ma anche dopo la sua esperienza nella guerra civile spagnola, riguardo alla quale scrive Homage to Catalonia. “Ogni riga di lavoro serio che ho scritto dal 1936 a questa parte è stata scritta, direttamente o indirettamente, contro il totalitarismo e a favore del socialismo democratico, per come la vedo io.” E' il 1949: Eric Arthur Blair - George Orwell - pubblica 1984 e, dopo qualche settimana, muore. Chissà perché, mi viene in mente una foto dove lui sorride affianco alla scritta 'BBC'. Orwell non ha mai potuto vedere quali emozioni il suo capolavoro ha dato, quali sono state le reazioni dei lettori, non ha mai potuto ridere davanti all'errore di stampa che per anni ha tormentato il suo romanzo. Orwell è morto qualche settimana dopo aver scritto 1984 ma, probabilmente, già sapeva che sarebbe diventato una Bibbia per molte persone. Non mi voglio dilungare ancora, perché potrei aprire il documento che ho in una cartelletta dispersa nel mio computer e copia-incollare qui quelle trenta pagine di analisi, di parallelismi, di accenni storici, di confronto con altre teorie del controllo che mi sono costate mesi di lavoro. Ma non lo farò perché, come ho detto prima, 1984 è un libro che va digerito. E non si è mai sentito di nessuno capace di digerire con l'intestino che sta dentro la pancia di un'altra persona."

487,Loelie Schmitz,This book is a classic. David Bowie wrote an album based on this book and I first heard of it 3 years ago when I learned that Muse (which happens to be my favorite band of all time) also based their 5th album on this book and you can really see each song exploiting a different side of the book. It really helped me understand the book which is of a extremely interesting complexity.This is the kind of books that stays in people's minds and change their way to see and analyze our society. At least that's what it did to me. 
488,Souheil Moufarrej,"When I was first suggested to read this book I was told that 1984 was a good read (no pun intended), a ""page turner"", heck even a classic, but no one told me that the book was as good as I could imagine. Winston, a simple yet passionate man finds himself in the wrong time period, he is stuck within a time of gloom and doom and cannot seem to have a single moment of privacy. The Party has taken early 20th century totalitarianism to new depths, with each person subjected to 24 hour surveillance and where people's very thoughts are controlled to ensure purity of the oligarchical system in place. The mastermind of all such surveillance is only known as, Big Brother. Winston goes through the problems that any other man would go through, like love, love for the one they call Julia. Julia is a beautiful young woman, much in contrast with Winston physically, but equally sickened by the excesses of her rulers. Such related sickening of the rulers and the oligarchy allows for both Julia and Winston to fall in love. Eventually, Winston and Julia confess to a man by the name, O'Brien, whom they believe to be a member of the Brotherhood (an underground organisation aimed at bringing down the Party), their hatred of the Party. O'Brien welcomes them into the Brotherhood with an array of questions and arranges for Winston to be given a copy of ""the book,"" the underground's treasonous volume written by their leader, Emmanuel Goldstein, former ally of Big Brother turned enemy. Winston gets the book at a war rally and takes it to the secure room where he reads it with Julia napping by his side. The two are disturbed by a noise behind a painting in the room and discover a tele-screen. They are dragged away and separated. Winston finds himself deep inside the Ministry of Love, a kind of prison with no windows, where he sits for days alone. Finally, O'Brien comes. Initially Winston believes that O'Brien has also been caught, but he soon realises that O'Brien is there to torture him and break his spirit. The Party had been aware of Winston's ""crimes"" all along; in fact, O'Brien has been watching Winston for the past seven years.Finally, O'Brien takes Winston to Room 101, the most dreaded room of all in the Ministry of Love, the place where prisoners meet their greatest fear. Winston's greatest fear is rats. O'Brien places over Winston's head a mask made of wire mesh and threatens to open the door to release rats on Winston's face. When Winston screams, ""Do it to Julia!"" he relinquishes his last vestige of humanity. Winston is a changed man. He sits in the Chestnut Tree Café, watching the tele-screens and agonising over the results of daily battles on the front lines. He has seen Julia again. She, too, is changed, seeming older and less attractive. She admits that she also betrayed him. In the end, there is no doubt, Winston now loves Big Brother. A truly wonderful and tasteful book. The gloom and doom might seem unappealing at first, but that is what makes the book such a deep and emotional venture. 5/5"
489,Pete,"After so long in print I don't think I need to sit here and spout the marvels of this masterpiece, we all know it's virtues, and if you do not, read this book. It's storytelling style is different than the modern reader is used to, and Orwell can dryly ramble indefinately. However, the dystopian world that Orwell creates is eerie in it's familiarity and with the state of the world and the state of the US now it is rather prophetic. Here is also an interesting link that shows how our world is Orwellian today. Enjoy http://www.studentsfororwell.org/"
490,Lotz,"This book is doubleplus good.Orwell’s 1984 is a masterpiece. As a piece of fiction, pure and simple, it is expertly written. The characters are memorable, the dialogue is engaging, and the writing is alternately visceral, exciting, and beautiful. But of course, 1984 is something more than a novel. It is, to use Orwell’s phrase, propaganda. Ideas abound in this relatively slim volume. In fact, the amount of thought that Orwell manages to condense into one scenario is breathtaking. I want to use this review to try and subdivide some of them.
Politics
. The most obvious theme in Orwell’s book is dystopia. Dystopias and utopias have been used since the very beginning of Western political thought to explore what governments should and shouldn’t do, and what would be the most perfect (or horrible) sort of state. Logically, there may only be one perfect form of something, and an infinite number of imperfect forms. But ideas as to what constitutes the most and least desirable societies vary immensely. This is Orwell’s take on the latter.The danger, for Orwell, is collectivism: the complete and total denial of the individual in favor of the collective (the Party). This is wedded to a self-conscious drive for power. Indeed, however evil is the government in 1984, it’s at least not hypocritical. That is, it makes it very clear that it wishes to stay in power infinitely, and have an infinite amount of power. This lust for endless power would naturally tend towards collectivism, since individuals are limited by their lifespans, strengths, intellects, etc. This is the why, but the how is also important. Which brings me to…
Epistemology & Metaphysics
. There are several strictly philosophical questions running through the course of this book. For example: what is reality? Winston is a realist: he holds that things are real whether or not they are observed. In other words, Winston believes that reality is in no way dependent on consciousness. O’Brien, on behalf of the party, is an idealist, which means that he believes that reality is completely dependent on consciousness. In other words, truth is merely very strong belief.Another, related issue is the existence of the past. Now, this is a question I’ve grappled with. There are two sides of it. One can ask, “did the past exist?” But clearly this is the same as asking “is there a past?” and unless you wish to posit that you have, this very moment, been created, fully fledged with habits and memories, then I don’t think we can seriously question the past.No, the question is “does the past exist?” And the answer, it seems to me, is no. Records and memories exist. We can observe the present and infer things (rightly or wrongly) about the past. But the past is not currently existing, which is why we differentiate it from the present. This drives Winston (and perhaps Orwell) bonkers.The upshot of this is, of course, that the Party can control reality (according to its theory of reality) if it controls human consciousness. The Party can also control the past if it controls the present. And he who controls the past controls the future.
Human Nature
. I’ve heard a lot of crap written on both sides about the existence or non-existence of “human nature."" I think this is partly because the term is poorly chosen. We never speak of “Dog Nature” or “Ant Nature.” But as soon as talk comes to human behavior, Human Nature pops up. And thinkers, when trying to either prove or disprove it, seem to think of “human nature” like some Platonic ideal, or some law tablet in a strange language that’s buried in each one of our brains.As far as I can see, the real question often boils down to “what is the degree of flexibility in human behavior?” Or alternately, “is there a limit to what humans can adapt to?” The problem is that “behavior” is vague, and is dependent on circumstances. For example, we normally think of ants as automatons with little behavioral flexibility. But if a group of ants were put into a room full of strong-smelling chemicals, I bet they wouldn’t act the way they normally do. To pick an example closer to home, cannibalism is taboo in the vast majority of the world; yet when people are in starvation conditions, cannibalism is reverted to.So clearly answering the question is tricky, because even if a good description of average human behavior can be formulated by observing extant human populations, who’s to say whether new types of behavior could arise with novel circumstances? The circumstances that exist in 1984 have never existed, so I’m not sure it can be said with certainty whether humans can be so ‘de-humanized’. However, I believe there’s good reason to think that it’s unlikely.I’ll stop these reflections here. The novel is just so rich, you could spend a lifetime discussing it. (Other issues I'm curious about, but not up to tackling, are the relationship of thought to language, and the part that Christianity plays in Orwell's descriptions of guilt, power, and the Party.) Suffice to say, if you haven’t read it, read it. And if you have read it, think about it."
491,Russell,"""And perhaps you might pretend, afterwards, that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop and didn’t really mean it. But that isn’t true. At the time when it happens you do mean it. You think there’s no other way of saving yourself and you’re quite ready to save yourself that way. You want it to happen to the other person. You don’t give a damn what they suffer. All you care about is yourself.""This is the saddest story I have ever read, and honestly the most terrifying. A good horror story is constructed on the premise that the scary aspect of the story is either: A. Probable or possible in the physical world of the reader. OR. B. So horrid that the reader wishes to never be in the physical world of the character, even if that world may seem far-fetched and impossible. 1984 contains both of these elements occupying the same time and space. A quote from Braveheart comes to mind. ""They can take my life, but they will never take my freedom."" Except they took his freedom, his mind, and destroyed the most important human attribute, love. The worst part is that in the end, he didn't even know it. There is nothing to feel good about, and a lot to feel bad about after reading this. But Orwell has done it sooo well. The writing is very good, the characters are honest and full, and the story is amazing. "

494,4Castro M,"Within George Orwell's book ""1984"", there is a continuous feeling of annoyance, incompetence, and insecurity exemplified throughout the book. For example, the quote ""...at the ministry he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was not required"" (22) and ""...[the children] are disappointed because they couldn't go see the hanging"" (23). This imagery is used to make the reader feel resentment towards the society depicted within 1984 as well as allowing us to better picture ourselves in the character's shoes.Orwell uniquely writes this book to give a reader a perfect image in their head of the setting and emotions of the main characters by using carefully picked wordings that convey powerful emotions. This can be seen in the quote ""..the songs, the banners, the processions, the hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship of Big Brother-it was all a sort of glorious game to them"" (24). Another example is given in the quote ""we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness"" (24). Orwell uses this type of language in order to involve the reader in the plot of the book. "
495,Andy Hong,"*WARNING: SPOILERS*Although George Orwell’s 1984 is by no means a lengthy or an aged novel, it is still one of the most thought-provoking and timeless works of literature ever written. Winston, the protagonist, faces a grueling life in dystopian England, where “war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength.” Such paradoxes are common in Air Strip One, as England is called in Orwell’s world, as the Ministry of Peace deals with war, the Ministry of Truth with censorship, the Ministry of Plenty with scarcity, and the Ministry of Love with punishment and torture. Winston, an outer party member, works with the Ministry of Truth, where he feels conflicted with the information that he is exposed to, and what the government tells him is real. In the end, his personal conflicts and his urges to rebel against the oppressive society that he is part of lands him in the Ministry of Truth, where Winston first learns of the true nature of the party and before allowing himself to be brainwashed after brutal torturing- O’Brien, the man who was in charge of Winston’s re-education, explains: “[The Nazis and the Communists] pretended…that they had seized power [to get to a] a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that…Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.”	The novel also gives a bleak solipsist and nihilistic view of the world that really questions one’s existence in the world. I, for one, found myself questioning the validity of what we perceive every day as truth- to cite Plato’s Allegory of the Cave, I had to take a minute to decide whether my life was indeed what I had always thought it was, or just a series of shadows cast inside a figurative cave by forces beyond my control."
496,Natália Fontana,"Um dos melhores livros que já li, e certamente minha distopia favorita.Orwell consegue nos fazer refletir sobre o poder da mídia e a manipulação das massas pelo governo. O livro faz pensar sobre nossa própria realidade que, embora (ainda?) distante do mundo descrito pelo autor, apresenta algumas de suas características, mesmo que atenuadas. O duplipensar é algo que se vê muito nos dias de hoje. Orwell fala de um mundo aonde o medo é entendido como segurança e a noção de liberdade é deturpada. Uma dica é ler também Admirável Mundo Novo. É interessantíssimo comparar a forma como Orwell e Huxley enxergam o futuro."
497,Kelly Newton,"I was certain that I had read 1984 at some point growing up, but as I started reading, I realized I had not. We have just become so accustomed to some of the phrases in the book, and the concept of ""big brother"", that I felt like I was reading it all over again. I'm kind of glad I waited. Distopian novels are of interest to me, but I think I understand and appreciate this in a different way as an adult than I would have in high school. Fascinating and haunting read. My brain is definitely in overdrive, and the importance of learning and growing is even fresher after a good dose of 1984. "
498,Charles F. Bond,"I had been wanting to read this book for a long time before finally, whilst visiting an independent book shop, I stumbled upon it and bought it.The story struck me from the beginning and I was immediately immersed into a world I could quite well believe. It wasn't exactly what I had envisioned it to be, it was better and surpassed my expectations hugely.Considering Orwell wrote this 45 years before I think he did well to envision such a future. What jumps at me from the read is: How far away are we from being governed in a similar way? Is what we read on the internet, hear and see in the media actually the truth or are we kept in the dark on a host of matters which concern us all."

500,Xander,"I was blown away by how relevant this book still is today. I read it because it was on my list of ""How have I never read this book?"" There are many many more on that list, but this one was near the top. Following Winston Smith through his journey in a world where everything is seen and heard by Big Brother was harrowing to say the least. The build up of his hatred for the government in which he works is natural and easy to understand. In fact, I found that it was slightly difficult to get into the book, not because of the writing or a lack of interesting plot, but because it was so disturbing that it brought me down to think of living like that. Books tend to be an escape for me, so to read something that is so vividly imprisoning was not so easy. Once I pushed through and accepted the world in which Winston lived I was hooked. You can't help but celebrate his little victories against the omnipresent eye and hope against all odds that things will change. I think that the real power of this book comes from the ending which will stay with you forever. This is one of many reasons that this book is a classic. If it is also on your ""How have I never read this book?"" list, then bump it up to the top. It is not a difficult read in terms of the writing style, only in so much that you know that there is far too much truth in this fiction."
501,Oscar,"Pues no sé qué decir de este libro que no se haya dicho ya; solo sé que a partir de ahora Orwell se consagra como uno de mis escritores favoritos aunque su manera de narrar no sea precisamente ""exquisita"". El final ampliamente discutido de esta novela (que muchos toman por ensayo), me pareció el final perfecto. Sí, es cierto que un régimen totalitario de esa escala es simplemente insostenible en la vida real y estaría destinado al fracaso desde su inicio. Pero hay que tener en cuenta que el Orwell que concibió esta obra fue un Orwell que había perdido a su esposa a causa de la tuberculosis y que se encontraba postrado por la misma enfermedad; esa intensa sensación de desamparo que lo abatía en los últimos años de su vida fue lo que lo llevó a escribir a un Winston (¿spoilers?) subyugado por los ideales del partido y entregado totalmente a su amor por el Gran Hermano. Solo por eso puedo decir que amé el tono inevitablemente trágico y cínico de esta obra.""En un tiempo de engaño universal, decir la verdad es un acto revolucionario""."
502,Sebastian Mendo,"""1984"" is the ""Metropolis"" or ""2001 A Space Odissey"" of literature. It's the timeless Sci Fi novel that showed the world the true meaning of the advancements in technology. It's the book that inspired countless distopian visions of the future, many of which are currently mass produced, throughout history not only in literature but also in film (Brazil) and videogames (Bioshock Infinite). This book takes place in a time where technology and the government completely dominate mankind. Privacy and freedom of speech have long been forgotten due to the rise of a symbol called Big Brother that has been said to be watching everyone at every time. History has been altered in order to convince people throughout time that the type of government that exists at that time has saved them from war with other countries. We follow the character Winston Smith on this world not really understanding what's going on around him. He is one of the few that hasn't been brainwashed into believing all of those things Big Brother has caused people to believe. Without spoiling anything, thinking in such way during those times will certainly create some consequences not only for him but for all of his surroundings and his soon to be found loved ones. George Orwell's vision of the future is to me the only distopian vision I am frightened by. His narrative and description of every single aspect of this world has completely riveted me and disturbed my views on the advancements of technology. Without ""The Orwellian Nightmare"", books such as "" A Clockwork Orange"" or even "" The Hunger Games"". Many books have tried to capture the coldness and frightful distopian future that we have been presented but as said above it is a concept that has become completely mass produced and even become part of a way of selling. This is the absolute distopian novel and possibly the second best aged novel is history (besides The Great Gatspy). ""1984 gets a 5/5. "
503,Leonard,"Under Big Brother’s omniscient eyes, Winston Smith tried to ignite his only freedom, the freedom to believe in “obvious” truths, but by the novel’s end, at the café Winston was unsure what two plus two would make, a sign that O’Brien had successfully reintegrated a “lost soul” and Winston had become like his friends and neighbors, unable to question and thus unable to revolt. What sends shivers down our spines is not the various tortures O’Brien performed, but after these tortures, Winston’s total capitulation¾mind, body, and soul¾to Big Brother. When the mind kowtows to external authority and ceases to reflect and question, then the individual had successfully metamorphosed into a machine.Oceania SocietyWinston, by editing previous documents to conform to Oceana’s present position, such as whether Eurasia is friend or foe, had helped the regime’s guardians, who like O’Brien believed “who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past,” mold the citizens’ minds. But Oceana, like other totalitarian regimes, also turned to the indispensable tool, fear, to chisel its citizens’ minds and hearts to its agenda’s shape and form. To stimulate fear and rouse its citizens to a common cause, it would when necessary create fathom enemies, either Eurasia or Eastasia, even though these totalitarian regimes also had similar ideologies, or rather, like Oceana, no ideologies. Under 1984’s dystopian sky, Winston must bow, not only because of Big Brother’s overwhelming power and presence, but also because of Winston’s inability to form any ideologies. Even though he wanted to think freely, he lacked the training and thus the analytical mind to counter O’Brien’s offenses. In the end, his mind followed the path of least resistance.George OrwellOrwell’s 1984 is a dark apocalypse of sub-human society where homo-sapiens had replaced machines to operate an efficient hierarchy, an apocalypse which any people would usher wherever and whenever they ceased to question “intuitively obvious truths.”"
504,Liza,"I've read this book ages ago and its effect on me was nothing short of an electric shock. As amazing as this book is, I don't think I will ever pick it up again, it hit too close to home. The book was written in the forties, predicting what would happen in 1984. Well, I went to school in USSR in the eighties and let me tell you, Orwell got it spot on. The bits that shook me up the most were parts about the Children League, which was the exact mirror or the Soviet ""Pioneer"" scheme. I guess that was because it was something that I had experienced on a personal level. I was one of those kids marching around waving flags and signing slogans. At school were were always told a story of a little boy named Pavlik Morozov, who was meant to be our hero and role model. His achievement - He reported his father to the communist authorities for hiding grain from the collective farm in his house in order to feed his family. We were never told what happened to the father (presumably a bullet in the head) and the rest of the family (presumably starved to death). This exactly parallels the actions of the children of Winston's next door neighbors. The restrictions on food, where getting anything other than the tasteless government stamped essentials was also an everyday thing. This also applied to little bits of contraband and black market stuff occasionally obtained and treasured. Been there, done that. Then there was Julia who was a member of the Anti-sex league. This also really rang true, since from a very young age we were always filled with an idea that sex was one of the perversions of capitalism (actual sex education didn't come into it)and should be avoided at all times. Thinking back at all those things was always a bit odd and mostly arb, until they clicked into place after reading 1984. Before that I never even realized that I (as in me!) was actually a little cog in the giant machine that is totalitarianism. It was quite an eye opener. I was most impressed with the ending of the book. Far, far too many books are utterly spoiled by a happy ending. This book was not. All I can say is that I had nightmares about rats for weeks afterwards. Undoubtedly, one of the most powerful books ever written. "

506,Moises Ribeiro jr,"Amazing book, a great story that gives you a complete and open minded view of what is the world and how power shifts so slightly and the challenge of defending your own rights is much harder than you really think. "
507,Philip,"With the latest revelations of NSA intelligence-gathering techniques, a friend of mine suggested that I pick up this book. What shocked me was the accuracy with which Orwell predicted government intrusion into daily life....in 1948!!! Orwell imagines people sitting in front of screens every day that monitor their daily activity. He sees the ability to track and listen-in on people on the move as another tool in the pocket of the government. Through our smartphones and computers, the government today has intruded into almost every aspect of our lives.There are some further parallels can be drawn as well. Orwell saw one factor in the political decline as the loss of “external reality,” namely that reality is objective and observable. Such a concrete philosophical notion of reality has been replaced by the current postmodern subjective reality where 2+2 *can* equal 5, if that’s what I think it equals. In today’s society where there is no sin or goodness but in what you determine to be such, there is but one small step towards an Orwellian society. If the locus of what determines reality shifts from the person to the state. And perhaps much of this has already happened behind our backs. Because most of us have lost our notions of objective external reality through the public education system of our nation.And then there’s the issue of history. In an age where we’re moving more and more towards reliance on cloud-based electronic mediums, erasure of history is truly only a keystroke away. Oral traditions and histories have been exchanged for written ones. Written ones have been exchanged for electronic ones. And the end result is that most in our society knows less about history than ever. Contrary to Emerson and other writers and thinkers who have seen history (and living in light of history) as weak or sub-human, Orwell sees history in its rightful primacy. If we don’t understand the past, we can’t possibly understand the present. The richness of history leads us to the greatness of religion, the beauty of art, and the heights of science. Ignoring history leads only to self-destruction, enslavement, and loss of beauty.I would suggest pairing this read with Huxley’s equally dystopian “A Brave New World” for maximum effect. Readers should be advised that there are several depictions of sex and torture in some sections of this book. The literary and historical significance of the work, however, makes it worth reading for the discerning adult.Let me close this review by saying that this book doesn’t leave me as doom and gloom as I suppose it has left many other readers. While I believe that man is capable of great evil like that portrayed in the book, I believe that things are not meant to be the way they are. In spite of our notions of a subjective reality, the effects of self-serving politicians, poverty, famine, war, greed and so on strike us all as wrong because they really are fundamentally wrong. We long for wrongs to be made right and for an objective, external reality that we can hang on to. And nothing can take that feeling out of us. Even if someone could use our deepest fears against us, we still cannot repress that testimony. And it is because I know that the world is broken (as Orwell warns), I know it can be fixed."
508,Gab,"The extent of my experience with Dystopian futures would be The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, Divergent and brief passages here and there. The brutal honesty of 1984's setting shocked me, and its world's completeness made it real enough to be terrifying- more terrifying than any horror book I've ever read as a matter of fact. Never has a book scared me so much. 1984 is the most disturbing and provoking book I have ever read. Why was it terrifying? Its themes, for the most part. As a free-thinker, turning each page of 1984 made me feel like I was taking a step back against a wall and slowly being cornered. Themes like control and dominance, freedom (of thought and otherwise), politics, the importance of the past, what reality is, and being told what to think when to think it and how? It's all been written before, but I can't help but feel that George Orwell made them as terrifying as possible. For an extra dimension to it: put in context the fact that this book was written by a man who'd served in the Home Guard in Great Britain and had worked for the BBC during WWII. No sugarcoating whatsoever was found in this book- the main character Winston was shown as a real jerk at times, a really complete image of how humanity is and how we will only continue to be. Another brutal truth that blew me away as I read through this book. Speaking of characters: the psychological development they each face in this book was fantastic. Maybe that's another scary part; the idea that maybe if placed in the situations that Winston was placed in (torture, totalitarian regimes, all powerful leaders) I too would change and lose myself. Maybe I'd lose reality. If you're looking for action or cool futuristic weapons and fights however, this is not the book for you. Looking for a cute love story between characters? None of that either. I'm still completely shaken by this book so maybe my review makes no sense whatsoever. But that shock is actually why 1984 gets five stars. "
509,Barbara Williams,This is one my favorite books of all time. Period.
510,Jamey,"The book provides a good non-fictional look at fascism and is often compared to A Brave New World. While I believe Orwell's 1984 was meant to parallel Eastern European Nationalistic States (more generally Soviet and and Nazi doctrines) I believe New World to take an alternate Western Democratic doctrine. Both books deal their subjects an environment of subversion, subjugation and oppression. That's essentially it. However what is most amazing about both of these books, and to some extent Fahrenheit 451 (which is often compared with the other two), is the way in which many of the underlying tones are just as relevant as the day the books were published.Throughout both books (1984, New World) the authors detail the systems and functions of their created authoritarian states. The funny thing is, as I read, I found similar characteristics within my own culture (US), in all aspects, politically, economically, socially...Many people will argue that 451 stands shoulder to shoulder with these two books. I feel that their almost outlandish concepts are what separate them from 451. And it is these concepts that also remarkably ring so clear with the past and the present.By the way I feel like 451 is a poor man's New World, even though I love Bradbury. Take that with a grain of salt because I read 451 years back."
511,Ilya Golokolenov,"1984, Джордж Оруэлл. Классическая антиутопия, описываются мир победившего тоталитаризма. Не смотря на небольшой объём, самая сложная для прочтения книга на данный момент. Непокидающее чувство отвращения, страха, паранойи и презрения. Именно таким пытаются выставить СССР самые ярые противники советской власти: пропаганда, запугивание, угнетение, переписывание истории, вечный дефицит.Только здесь этого всего больше, здесь тотальный контроль личности. Доходит до того, что тебе грозит суд за неправильное, ""неправоверное"" выражение лица во время ""двухминутки ненависти"". Страшный кошмар параноика на яву. Книга пропитана безысходностью, и как бы тебе не хотелось увидеть счастливый конец, ты понимаешь, что его не будет, и от этого понимания уже становится тошно.Планы, строившиеся в этом обществе, очень сильно напомнили мне книги и идеи Айн Ренд, конкретно ""Гимн"", где описано такое же общество, через длительный срок(читай тысячи лет или сотню, разницы нет, это общество развиваться точно не станет). В обоих обществах ведётся борьба со словом ""Я"", с самим осознанием себя как личности. Только общество имеет право мыслить, только партия непогрешима и бессмертна.Книга однозначно прекрасна, Джордж Оруэлл даст пресловутой Ванге 100 очков вперёд и, возможно готов посостязаться с Жюлем Верном в способностях предсказателя( я не говорю, что он предсказал подобное общество и оно существует, нет, но в книге очень много идей, которые сейчас существуют), и я был бы рад, если бы мы такие книги проходили в школе, хотя не факт, что это не было бы слишком рано.10/10P.S. Старший брат следит за тобой."
512,Meggin,"Readers follow along in this dystopian novel through the mind of Winston. Readers become flies on the walls of everything he does, thinks, and feels, and almost unknowing, readers are drawn to experience the same emotions Winston feels himself. Anger, love, hate, fear, sadness, even the uncertainty of insanity... the reader will find themselves deeply connected to the main character by the turn of the last page. This is one of the few books I have read in a long time that has been able to evoke such feeling out of me. SPOILER ALERT:From the moment Winston is arrested to the time he is released towards the end of the novel, I could not help but feel the out most sympathy for him. As he was beaten, the words evoked a strong image of pain in my mind. When he was interrogated and being ""treated"" I could clearly picture his anger, confusion, and frustration at the fact that he was seeing four fingers and not five. By the end of his torture, I almost hoped for them to kill him just so he would feel relief, for what life could he possibly live afterward (which is obviously answered). By the end, I was saddened and almost disappointed that they had disillusioned to the extent of actually loving Big Brother. (Unless I completely misunderstood the ending of the book.)In any case, this book was one of the best utopian/dystopian novels I have read and I highly recommend it. "
513,James,"I don't think I've had such polar responses from a single book before. Romantic, hopeful but also cold and depressing. So many cyberpunk novels revel in ideas such as freedom loss, dehumanization and constant surveillance, in a way that almost makes them seem cool. On some level they make you want to live in that world, to be part of the revolution. Because in so many cyberpunk novels this revolution is portrayed, no matter how distantly, to be eventually possible.1984 is not one of these novels. Perhaps because it really was the first of its kind. Some consider 1984 not to be cyberpunk, but to me it is, and blatantly so. Dehumanization, utter totalitarian control and oppressive technology. In fact I do not think even once, futuristic (for 1948) technology is ever used in a positive way. Always to oppress, to suppress individualism, to survey, to control, or to brainwash.This book gives you a beautiful, romantic sense of hope and love, then utterly rips it out of you. The ending of 1984 is so depressing and frustrating that it makes me dislike it, but at the same time I know it's the intention. At any rate, this book left a big mark on me, and I will definitely read it again in the future.What really surprised me about this novel is that before the tragic final chapters, there is a really beautiful and quite modern romance. Perhaps, for shear emotional masturbation, I'll read the first half by itself, stopping before the point where all hope is taken away."
514,Roberto,"There’s so much to like in this book that I’m bumping its rating up to 5 stars. It seems like every other page contains something that’s relevant to our time. During my last reading, I felt that the observations on the role of the media are particularly poignant nowadays. I also found Julia more interesting this time around. I’d always thought her character was not very well developed, but she’s a rebel in a very different way from Winston. She is much more self-centered and her rebellion basically consists of just circumventing rules that inconvenience her, which is why Winston cleverly describes her as “only a rebel from the waist downwards.” She is young and resigned to the status quo, probably because she doesn’t know any better. Winston’s idea of a rebellion is more romantic, whereas Julia’s is more realistic, immediate and practical."

516,Avto Sofromadze,"1984 is a horror story and a political treatise. The long socialist at the novel's core is integral to Orwell's meaning. Orwell warns against the dangers of authoritarianism. Orwell's dystopian state offers a devastating view of a society where one is unable to say what one thinks, one must slavishly believe in a single party and a single ideology, and language has been degraded to such a state that it only serves the ends of officialdom. The silent masses are the backdrop to his work. The ""proles"" play no part in society other than to do the work of the governing class. They are subjugated to the capitalist system.1984 is brilliantly written--with a searing conscience. Orwell’s 1984 is rightly a modern classic of both literature and the social sciences. Orwell combines a thriller narrative with a core political message to demonstrate his brilliance as a thinker and his masterfulness as a literary artist."
517,Emilia,"George Orwell's ""1984"" is such a powerful read, and a fascinating look into the world where one is under control of the State through the ""Big Brother."" Orwell tried to depict a totalitarian state, where the truth didn't exist as such, but was merely what the ""Big Brother"" said it was. Freedom was only total obedience to the Party, and love an alien concept, unless it was love for the Party. The story is told from the point of view of Winston Smith, a functionary of the Ministry of Truth whose work involved the ""correction"" of all records each time the ""Big Brother"" decided that the truth had changed. The Party slogan said that ""Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past"", and they applied it constantly by ""bringing up to date"" the past so as to make it coincide with whatever the Party wanted. -este o premonitie cu privire la societatea comunista , la totalitarism si la control;. Sau poate ca e mai mult decat atat daca acum ne gandim la ‘The growing number of surveillance cameras on street corners, the ironic (but deliberately) named Patriot Act in the U.S., the rise of political and religious intolerance in the world...’Un film care aduce un pic la atmosfera carti : ""V for Vendetta"" si realitatea comunismului din Europa de Est."
518,Ayana Yakhni,"This book is full of darkness and hate, MY HEART CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE! A lot of unexpected plot twists and a very realistic ending.

A frightened, harmful, dark book but yet HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! "

520,Claudia,"1984 is written as a futuristic, dystopian society. The dictatorship of this society is so ingrained in the population, that very few are able to question it. When they try, they vanish without a trace. Winston doesn't start off as a sympathetic character. I found him to be a little pathetic, however this was very much so due to the situation in which he was placed. Oceania in 1984 is a terrifying place. The slightest slip of the tongue, the slightest mis-thought, the slightest movement and you're plucked out of existence.This is the world that Winston Smith faces and tries to fight. And fight he does! He engages in a love affair with a woman who is, according to the Party, off limits. He begins writing in a diary in defiance. He attempts to find counter-parts to his plight, to oppose everything the Party is and the Party stands for. The Party controls everything. The Party rules by fear, and ingrains fear into the learning doctrine of the citizens. If you fear Big Brother enough, you will survive. Maybe.This book absolutely terrifies me. The entire concept is close to unbelievable, and yet how far is it from the truth? How many different ways do people have of spying on us twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week? This terrifies me.1984 is completely devastating. The result of Winston's capture, imprisonment, and torture saddens me. All of his resolve vanishes. His thoughts, ideas, feelings, and emotions are made to completely evaporate. All of this is done by a man he trusted, a man he believed was fighting against the Party with him. Most devastating of all, Winston is forced to betray his love, while simultaneously being forced to love everything he hates.1984 is a hugely emotional ride. It is intense, devastating, and heart breaking. Shakespeare couldn't even conceive of a tragedy as calamitous as the one George Orwell spun so exquisitely. "
521,Maha Atari,"“اوبراين: ""كيف يؤكد إنسان سلطته على إنسان آخر يا وينستون ؟""قال وينستون بعد تفكير: ""يجعله يقاسي الألم""رد أوبراين: ""أصبت فيما تقول. بتعريضه للألم , فالطاعة وحدها ليست كافية , وما لم يعانِ الإنسان الألم كيف يمكنك أن تتحقق من انه ينصاع لإرادتك لا لإرادته هو ؟إن السلطة هي إذلاله و إنزال الألم به , وهي أيضا تمزيق العقول البشرية إلى أشلاء ثم جمعها ثانية وصياغتها في قوالب جديدة من اختيارنا.هل بدأت تفهم أي نوع من العالم نقوم بخلقه الآن ؟ إنه النقيض التام ليوتوبيا المدينة الفاضلة التي تصورها المصلحون الأقدمون, إنه عالم الخوف و الغدر والتعذيب, عالم يدوس الناس فيه بعضهم بعضا.عالم يزداد قسوة كلما أزداد نقاء , إذ التقدم في عالمنا هو التقدم باتجاه المزيد من الألم.لقد زعمت الحضارات الغابرة أنها قامت على الحب والعدالة أما حضارتنا فهي قائمة على الكراهية, ففي عالمنا لا مكان لعواطف غير الخوف و الغضب والإنتشاء بالنصر وإذلال الذات, واي شيء خلاف ذلك سندمره تدميراً..”"

If you can f e e l that staying human is worthwhile, even when it can't have any result whatever, you've beaten them."" ""Facts at any rate, could not be kept hidden.

""This is what we have to do unflinchingly. But this is not what we shall be doing when life is worth living again."" ""The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense. Nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible."" ""We are the dead.

524,alice,"lettura estremamente interessante! la parte sul bipensiero non mi è stata chiarissima fin da subito,ma poi viene ben ampliato. che dire... un mondo terrificante in cui 'fiducia' 'libertà' 'amore' sono parole vuote e senza significato. la conoscenza e il nostro pensiero ci permettono di valutare il mondo e di capirlo. nel mondo di Winston tutto ciò non può accadere... loro non hanno concezione del loro io nè del mondo. vengono mantenuti in uno stato di prigionia totale e privi anche del minimo tratto che caratterizza l'essere umano... ovvero la coscienza e lo spirito. I prolet nella loro igoranza e nella loro completa accettazione del Grande Fratello sono più felici di Winston pur essendo molto più poveri e malati. il finale mi ha scioccato!!! (view spoiler)[Nella mia insana voglia di lieto fine ero convinta che l'animo umano avrebbe prevalso. che nonostante le torture e gli abusi Winston avrebbe reagito e si sarebbe sottratto al giogo del Grande Fratello. quando ho capito che così non era sono rimasta esterrefatta. poi pensandoci ho capito che era l'unico finale possibile per lui. Era sostanzialmente un inetto e anche un codardo. Aveva paura del Grande Fratello e le torture hanno definitivamente distrutto il suo spirito. La perfidia delle torture purtroppo per lui non erano volte ad una sua confessione, ma solo alla distruzione totale del suo pensiero. E il loro successo è stato totale. (hide spoiler)]"
525,Inês Silveira,o final :O
526,Marwan Sabry,"On a scale of 1 to 10, how depressing can one novel be? ... The answer is 1984. This is one amazing piece of literature I utterly loved it, very depressing but very beautiful. It's beauty doesn't lie in what is written as much as it does in what it means to you, ""the best books are the ones that tell you what you already know"".As an Egyptian revolutionist this novel makes me wonder what would I do in such situations, my first thought was ""I'll never cave in ... I shall rot in the cells of the ministry of love until I die of natural causes or from all the beating"", but then I realised Winston thought the same thing at first, later he actually yelled for them to take the love of his life instead of him. After that stage I really hated myself because I believed I would be broken at some point and won't be able to continue. Then there were more several stages until I reached the final one and probably the most realistic ... maybe I'll never know until I'm there, but I am not going to let anything short of room 101 break me :)Truth is what YOU believe is true, not what you're told is true."

528,Anubhav Garg,"Orwell's 1984 is perhaps the most celebrated dystopian book of all time. I consider it to be certainly praise-worthy. Orwell concocts a tale that cleverly forces his readers to examine and question many elements of their everyday lives. Although somewhat extreme, he highlights activities that existed to a degree in even 1948. Each page is intellectually stimulating and could be analyzed for hours. This is a magnificent book. My favorite part is definitely the ending. Never have I read a more thought-provoking conclusion. "

530,Patrik Hallberg,"This book shows no hope, is no satire like Orwells ""Animal Farm"", but I can't help but loving it. It is one of the most brilliant political books ever written (My other favorites would be Darkness at Noon, Clockwork Orange, Brave New World, The Trail and The Stranger). It makes you think about war/peace/freedom via the Ministry of Peace (Minipax), who deal with war, unfairness when it comes to resources based on where and into who you are born via the Ministry of Plenty (Miniplenty), who deal with rationing and starvation,torture/mind control/mind erasure via the Ministry of Love (Miniluv), who deal with torture, and finally politics, falsification of the past via the Ministry of Truth (Minitrue), who deal with propaganda. So much in this book has become a part of our life today. It kind of embodies the whole ""Big Brother is watching you"" mentality. 1984 is much more of a political work than a science-fiction work and it is one of the best books written during the 20th century. It's on Time's list All-TIME 100 Novels, it's nr 13 (board's list) and nr 6 (reader's list) on Modern Library's list 100 best novels, it's nr 8 on BBC's the big read. Essential reading!"
531,Steven,"George Orwell1984New York: New American Library, 1949328 pp. $9.99978-0-451-52493-5	George Orwell does an amazing job of crafting a credible and disturbing world in his classic 1984. The novel follows a man named Winston, who lives in airstrip one better known as Great Britain, as he progresses from a petty crime to outright rebellion, with his secret lover, Julia. In this world the malevolent government known as the party rules with an iron fist with no respect for privacy. Winston’s journey through this strange world captivates the reader on the very first page, with its unique ideas that are grounded in reality.	One of these concepts is doublethink which, is the process of forgetting the past making a false statement replace that and then forgetting the act of doublethink. This may seem as though it is an impossible, but George Orwell makes it believable through the propaganda of the party. Another unique addition is the setting of the novel. In it there are three superpowers stuck forever in a military standstill, the three being Oceania Eastasia and Eurasia. The world adds an interesting side plot to the novel with the progression of the war being reflected various news reports that Winston witnesses. 	Another great addition is Winston’s development as a character. In the first few pages he is a coward, the thought of rebellion barely even starting in his mind, but at the middle he has changed drastically. (Don’t want to spoil it) Julia, the love interest helps him evolve and adds a level of emotion to the novel. Their forbidden love is sure to please the ladies (I guess). However 1984 isn’t without faults. At some points it just becomes too much, with twenty or so pages of text that don’t even have to deal with the plot. However this will please some and just be an annoyance to others so it shouldn’t deter someone who is interested.	I strongly suggest anyone who feels even remotely interested by this to read 1984. It is an interesting, believable novel whose disturbing world and unique ideas are more important now than ever. "
532,Lyn,"This changed the way that I looked at ideologies and changed the way I looked at leadership. Cynical, scathing, and not without its flaws, this is still a stark, haunting glimpse at what could be. Chilling. The closing lines still come to me sometimes and remind me of depths that I can only imagine."
533,Hector Ibarra,"Just finnished reading this book, the world created by Orwell is utterly inmersing and engaging, you can almost hear the sounds, the voices and even the smell of many of the things descripted in this book, I loved it, every bit of it, all the narrative was flawless. It makes you think, it made me realize that many of the things happening in the novel are a living reality in my country (obviously to a lesser degree, but still the intention is there) specially everything about the freedom of speech and opinions. This novel is a very worth reading, somehow (for me) the protagonist exhibits a certain absurdism like Mersault (L´etranger, Camus), or it is just me?. Overall Id certainly revisit this distopyan world on a future re-read :). "

535,S.,"examined purely on literary merits one might fairly say that 1984 falls short, with, one would argue, a less developed than hoped for love story, but in terms of total impact on world culture, referenced by 17 years olds in Topeka and in Wuhan, Bratislava and Rio, 1984 of course rises to the level of ""top 100"" work and ""canonical literature,"" moving, striking, powerful, politically-informed, and politically-informing.Orwell's world, seen as a critique of Soviet Stalinism, may reflect English sensibilities, but of course in our CCTV, internet-web-connected society, ""city of London ring of steel"" society, what is of course noticeable is how much actually did happen.immediate post-war privation of blockaded UK noted"
536,Mariam Abood,"I featured this book in a book challenge here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1M2x... A very good book, and George Orwell is often described as the pioneer of the dystopian genre. It became quite hard to follow at parts (especially considering I hadn't bothered to read the appendix) but once I had read the appendix it became easier to follow and I began to appreciate the complexity of the plot. A lot of people dislike the ending however, because there is no clear resolution but that in itself is a common feature of the dystopian genre, so if you don't like it, don't read dystopian. Other than that, a very good read."
537,Silvia Daveri,"Questo classico più che una semplice lettura è un'esperienza. Anni fà, mi è capitato di partecipare ad un seminario di danza Butoh, danza espressiva giapponese che alterna movimenti lentissimi a convulsioni frenetiche, *se non avete mai visto uno spettacolo ve lo consiglio, la forza narrativa è devastante*; la lettura di 1984 ha aperto i rubinetti di canali emotivi inesplorati come il butoh. Crederete che sia pazza *un pò forse* ma mi piace sperimentare cose nuove ^_^. Nel seminario di butoh abbiamo camminato lentamente in linea retta verso le nostre emozioni e, anche se non mi crederete perchè bisogna provare per comprenderla a pieno, un groviglio di sentimenti sono esplosi ed emersi. 1984 ha avuto la stessa forza: camminare in linea retta attraverso le paure del genere umano. Ed è stato un lento scivolare. approfondisco qui ...http://silviadaveri-autorialblog.blog..."
538,Jamie,"“1984” tells a story unlike one I have ever read. It tells a tale of the future, in a way that is frightening. The main character Winston lives a government approved life by doing everything the government says he should do. He must worship the things the government says he should, Big Brother, and can’t even think for himself. Among many other “slaves” of the government, he decides to rebel and runs into others walking on the same path as he performs these acts against the government. He starts with tiny actions with his new found partner Julia, but runs into trouble once his acts get more intense.Orwell spends majority of the book focusing on how the government is watching the citizens around the town. There are telescreens, where people watch every move someone does. If something is done against the government’s rules, the person disappears and everyone forgets about them. Orwell creates a sense of terror when it is realized how much the government really can do.	“1984”, to me, was a well written book. Although a little tough to read at times, due to the newspeak and advanced vocabulary, this book is easy to follow and understand. Orwell did a great job creating an attachment between the reader and characters. The only part of the book that I wish was left out was the additional book inside the book, it seemed to drag the book down. I would recommend this to anyone interested in government abuse of power.

541,Shanna,"Never thought I'd fall in love with this book, as I'm not much of a sci-fi fan. I love everything about this book, it's so intense and an amazing story. I think this is one of the books that everyone should read before they die."
542,Nardos,"Extraordinary book!!! I just saw that ""1984"" has been enlisted as one of the top 100 books one must read and I totally agree. From the first page till the end, Orwell's imaginary world captivates you, takes you to a different place and shows you a different side of life. Orwell has a fascinating imagination and a deep understanding of the human behavior and thought. How he ever thought of and vividly described such a world doesn't ceases to amaze me. The situation in which the people are living in (the blind loyalty and brainwashed attitude they have towards their government and the party) made me relate it to the situation in North Korea. It is amazing how a book written decades ago can apply to situations in the present day. I highly praise both the book and its prolific author,and I will pay my gratitude by recommending this book to all fellow readers. It truly is a book worth reading. :)"

The thing I didn't like was Julia god damn it Julia, at first I like her i really like her because she was like Winston, they both where rebels they didn't like big brother, but then again who doesn't like big brother.The thing that really made me hate Julia was the fact that she just throw Winston in front of a bus just for her safety.And the person who really confused me was O'Brian, I thought he was in Winston side but I guess he Was just a Spy.Even though the begging is very boring It gets really good in section 2.

546,Kristal,"We have moved a lot (14 times to 4 different states) and sometimes I worry about my son getting confused when it comes to schoolwork. So this year after hearing about Common Core and how it would help put everyone on a level playing field, I was eager to begin and sat down one day to find out more information. and hopefully have my son prepared. Boy, was I in for a shock! Needless to say, I have since joined many groups in an effort to stop CC and have even started preparing to homeschool both my kids (a subject my husband & I are agreeing to disagree on). But through all of this, I kept thinking of a book that I had read in high school. It was 1984. And to reread it today and seeing the similarities and how much of it is true today is downright eerie. I admit I was blissfully unaware of the political machine, thinking that the powers in Washington were there to try and make a better life for us. Well, I am awake now and ready to stand up for myself and my family. I highly recommend this book, especially if you have some concerns abut what is happening in the world today. "
547,Shanawaz Ali,"Hands down one of the best novels in the English language. The idea has been done since, maybe even before but never to this degree. Never has the bleakness and oppression of such a world been narrated thus.But it is not the world that Orwell creates and shows that scares the most ... in fact i found it hard to be a part of Winston's world because I just could not imagine such a thing would be possible ... the thing that scares you the most is that another smaller, different version of Orwell's Party may be ruling your country, your continents and your world. The corporations you work for, you endorse may be exercising similar control over you. The news you hear and read may be tailored and above all THE WARS, THE WARS WE FIGHT MAY BE A TOOL TO EXPAND EXCESS PRODUCE!!!The most frightening and most depressing book I've ever read but I love it."
548,Artak Aleksanyan,Great and powerful book. Very much impressed. I'd recommend this book all my fellow journalists. Must read.
549,Dave,"""1984"" is one of the defining works of fiction from the 20th Century. Written by George Orwell (the pen name of Eric Arthur Blair) in 1949, it has become the work referenced in other literature, film, and music for a future government which controls all of its citizens, and uses them to maintain its own position of power. Of course, it was not the first novel to present this idea, but it is perhaps one that presents the future that is the most bleak and without hope. Other authors have created sterile futures built on technological advancements that have drained humanity from its citizens. Instead, Orwell's future has technology held in check or even regressing, while political power and control are the forces that imprison humanity in his future. It is easy to read fascism and communism into the government of `Big Brother', but one can see elements from ""1984"" in any type of government, they simply are more obvious in a totalitarian one. This novel has been recognized many times by readers. In 1952 it ranked 17th on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll, and in 1956 it tied for 9th on the same poll. In 1975 it tied for 41st on the Locus Poll for All-Time novels, in 1975 it was 34th on the Locus Poll for All-Time SF Novels, and in 1998 it was 21st on the Locus Poll for SF Novels from before 1990. The most fitting recognition though, must be the Prometheus Hall of Fame award which it won in 1984. "
550,Kelly Meehan,"This book tears through the depths of totalitarianism in the most jaw dropping way. George Orwell was a sightseer for the dangers of power, and puts it in the perspective of a man of the working class. The experiences which are told can be viewed from a global standpoint and will change the most close minded person's perspective. Orwell exemplifies individuality and free will showing how it can be taken away from populations. This book overall gives insight to major issues from the perspective of a man and his condemned relationship with a woman he at first despises."

553,Chris,"loved this book - this is by far my favorite book - the idea of totalitarianism or a dystopian world only sparks revolution and failure. The idea of trying to control people is absurd and useless because there will always be those that will go unsatisfied and disagree. I liked George Orwell's portrayal of the inner party and the outer party.It reminded me much of the colonialism in which the people of the outer party were forced to learn and grow up learning the thoughts and ideas of the inner party - much like what Europeans did to Africa or what the Spanish did to the Aztecs, mayans and incas.

555,Keith,"Without a doubt the most terrifying novel ever written. A worst case, worse nightmare scenario where not even the voice inside your head is safe from censorship. Your most innate human instincts can betray you, resulting in your death or worse: your total annihilation from existence, memory and history.One of the unexpected pleasures of this book is the forbidden yet fateful love between Winston and Julia, their trysts in the unspoiled English countryside some of the most wonderful in modern literature, given the austere setting of the world they live in.One of the saddest parts was the cruel destruction of their treasured conch.It is sobering to think how many people currently live in societies that are not too far off from Oceania in 1984. If North Koreans had knowledge of or access to this novel, I wonder if they'd see themselves and their wrecked, strangulated and mutilated society within?Upon finishing this dystopian masterpiece, all I could think about was how I will never view caged rats the same again."
556,Kirsten,"Sharp and merciless, 1984 is an important read for everyone, with much to think about in terms of surveillance, control and society. This is my second time reading this - the first was many years ago, long before I got into journalism or activism - and in reading it I found myself most struck by the oppression that people in Oceania do to themselves and each other, with minimal effort from the state. 1984 might be an exaggerated case, but there is more of it in today's society than we would care to admit. "
557,Abby,Classic Orwell. His indescribable stories always seem to captivate me. He pulls at the heartstrings in the most unemotional way all to prove a governmental point. i.e. totalitarianism is bad. I'd recommend this book to anyone who hates totalitarianism and loves a book with a complex plot line and great ending. 
558,Penny Yoke,"1984George Orwell is a freaking genius. I have no idea how someone could ever create a dystopian world with such precision, meticulous details, with an underlying ideology that is utter madness and yet logical and convincing. (This is basically what was written on the back of the book.) He invented a whole new language, Newspeak, which is English vocabulary that is narrowed down, and some of the Newspeak vocabulary that he invented is even in use today! ""Doublethink"", ""thoughtcrime"", ""blackwhite"". And the logic behind Newspeak is that without the correct words, people cannot think unorthodox things (orthodox is a recurring word in 1984), and thus they cannot commit anything wrong. That's at least what I got on surface, but I'm pretty sure there's something even deeper. 1984 is a book that has to be reread to be fully understood. That is why I say George Orwell is a genius.I am most fascinated with the idea of Doublethink - having two contradicting thoughts, but yet you believe in the false idea while being conscious of what is correct, and burying the correct version somewhere where it can't be found, and then forgetting that you even buried it. That is the ultimate act of deception - if you can deceive yourself to believe in the flaxen then you can convince everyone else. Ultimately, that is one of the many aims of the Party too - to control reality, that is to say, the reality in people's minds. Using O'Brien's example, if I can convince myself that I am levitating, and it can convince others that I am levitating, then I am levitating - there is no external reality. Pure genius, pure madness, pure logic. I'm as awed by O'Brien's intellect as Winston Smith (the main character), and sometimes I'm also wondering whether what I'm seeing is logic, or it's him twisting the truth around and I'm being played around by him. I really don't know.Of course there are a great many other ideas presented in this books - things that the Party does that is not the aim, but to achieve one ultimate goal, which is for you to find out. But be sure not to skip the back section on Newspeak vocabulary, or the Brotherhood manual, if you are really interested in the workings of the world!We see the workings of the world through the life and experiences of Winston Smith (and then these bits and pieces come together to have a clearer picture in the brotherhood manual), someone whose job is to alter past records so that they fit the present truth. (Once again, doublethink - changing the past, forgetting what the past has been, and then believing in the changed past). Like all main characters, he is unique - his thoughts are not fully controlled, and he has great intellect, and he is one of the few (or the only one) who is aware that something is wrong with the world, and as a result of being in the minority, he doubts his sanity. Initially, he is simply mentally against the Party, but he tries to control his thoughts so that he can escape the Thoughtpolice. And then O'Brien came in to invite him to the ""resistance"". His intelligence is remarkable, and I honestly don't know whether he is a better representation of George orwell's genius or O'Brien. So it's really sad when (view spoiler)[in the end, he submits to the party, and reduced to a pathetic state, both physically and mentally, simply drinking everyday and not thinking and HE LOVES BIG BROTHER. (hide spoiler)] Suffice to say that the Party is infallible, O'Brien is infallible. Aside: I still don't understand how O'Brien can read Winston's thoughts with such uncanny accuracy during the torture.1984 has the best world building I have ever seen, something that's very lacking in dystopian YA novels nowadays. I am wholly impressed by George Orwell, and surprisingly I don't remember having the same feeling when I read Animal Farm when I was eleven. I'm going to reread his books again.1984 - pure genius."

560,Neah,"There's something special about the book you discover for yourself. Neither mom nor dad have read this one. As a fifteen year old, 1984 changed my life. It taught me to think and to question...I guess this is not exactly a review. I just wanted to say how much this book means to me."
561,Joseph Sverker,"I don't know why I had prejudices against this book. Maybe it's because so many literature teachers want to use it in their teaching. Or maybe because I thought that it would be too masculine in a bad sense of the word. I had absolutely no ground for my preconceptions and they were completly smashed very early in the book. Orwell's book is engaging and at the same time very thoughtful. He is so right in man ways about the modern society even if he sets his book in a totalitarian state. He is on the other hand also influenced by his own time and it is impressive and interesting how he can write this book so early on after the second world war. I think Hannah Arendt would say that Orwell manages to portray a totalitarian state in a very authentic manner. The only thing I can imagine she would object to i the possibility of three co-existing states. Anyway, I don't want to give away the ending, but I still want to say that Orwell has done a very good job when it comes to following the mind and development of the main character as a reader. The reader comes extraordinarily close to Winston even though the book is written in third person."
562,Salman,شيء مثير كيف ان الكاتب تمكن من خلق عالم آخر ودولة كاملة بنظام اشتراكي شمولي بشع قد لا يتصوره البعض.الكاتب تطرق للتفاصيل مما يجعلك تعيش القصة كما لو كنت انت وينستون .. كما لو كنت انت بطل الرواية او بالاصح .. ضحيتها هناانصح بالكتاب 
563,Sivoj,"Outstanding.Orwell made a credible and clever dystopian society that could actually work, based on several real life exemples from fascists and communists countries. Then he ""improved"" it to be even more viciously efficient.He invented some terms which marked history like Big Brother, Doublethink and Newspeak.1984 was a warning against the twisted functioning of that kind of society. It seems like a complex matter, yet Orwell made it easy to read and accessible to everyone.The characters are maybe not that interesting, but they are here to make us see their world through their fate and make one more point about the privacy level they live in. Before starting the book I was worried, because it is a ""classic"".I was afraid it would be just a big rant and not a real novel, that the pace would be too slow, the writting too boring or too hard to read. But it was not. Even as an unexperienced reader, it was very enjoyable.The writting was actually very ""pure"". Simple sentences describe simple things. You don't have a whole paragraph about irrelevant stuff, descriptions are kept to the minimum you need, it sticks to the point. Even when it's getting more philosophical, ideas are expressed simply enough to make it accessible to everyone.The only rough part I found was a group of 20-30 pages, when the main character reads a book describing the society, filled with very dense informations. Those informations were necessary but it wasn't brought in a pleasant way.Still, it's very worth 5 starts, even if only for the mindblowing reflections of the author. I have yet to see another well thought-out dystopia which made its point so clear and close to our lives, while still being a real novel."

566,Amber,"I'm not sure why it took me 25 reading-years to get to 1984. To be fair to myself, 6 of those years were spent in the throes of reading horse books and the Babysitters' Club series. In junior high I was too young for it, then there was a period of high school and after high school when I felt rebellious against books you were ""supposed to read."" However, I am glad that I finally read 1984 as part of my book club. There are so many levels that it is a book you need to discuss with other people who have read it at the same time you did: not a discussion in a ""hey, I kind of remember this one part"" but a true discussion.What is so interesting about this book, as I previously mentioned, are the levels. For my parents' generation and all of those people who were adults during the Cold War, the fear of the surveillance is so prevalent. The idea that people know what you do at all times is very troublesome to that generation. However, with Facebook, Twitter, and even Goodreads, today's youth is not afraid of putting themselves out there. My friends who teach English mentioned that their students had no problems with the Party's surveillance or even the U.S. government's surveillance on them: it's a way to stay safe. Even I don't have a huge problem with it. What I did take away was the malleability of truth and memory. It was frightening to me how memories and reality were so easily altered. As a psychology teacher, I know about the malleability of memory. To see it on such a grand scale and the acceptance of new truths as forever truths is disturbing. The concept of ""Ignorance is Strength"" was hard for me to swallow, more so than the other tenants of the Party. I cannot imagine how crazy I would feel if I knew things to be fact, as Winston did, but everyone else denied these ""truths"" ever existed. Orwell's genius is the nesting of themes to grate upon all ideals and personality. If it's war, if it's ignorance, if it's freedom, there are ways to hit nerves in most people to (hopefully) prevent these kinds of states. Well done, Mr. Orwell. I'm sorry it has taken me so long to get here."
567,Fatin,"Never has a book affected me so deeply. Small shudders flit through whenever I think about 1984. This is the darkest book I've ever read, and I do not kid you when I say that it actually gave me a terrible headache that did no go away even after a long sleep. I'm not going to debate how this terrific society might come to be, or if it will ever come to be, but I hope that if it does, I'm no longer around."
568,Shaahin Ghamgosar,"1984 رمانی‌ست در توصیف آینده‌ی بشر. آینده ای که با کمی ذکاوت و تیز هوشی خود میتوانیم پیرامونمان ببینم. اورول کنترل بشر به دست سیستم ها و حکومت ها را چنان به ظرافت و تیز بینی و با هوش خیره کننده‌اش در شناسایی چگونگی این فرایند، تصویر کرده که من حیران ماندم. خاصه دست گذاشتن بر روی امری به نام ""جرم فکری"" آنقدر اندیشمندانه است که می‌باید ساعت ها وقت صرف کنید و به آن بی‌اندیشید که چگونه عملا حکومت‌ها حتی اندیشه‌ی شما را نیز کنترل می‌کنند، و این به خودی خود چیزی‌ست موحش و تکان‌دهنده. نخاندن این رمان به راستی که از دست دادن بسیاری اندیشه هاست. از متن رمان: ( خطر افشا کردن داستان وجود ندارد)می دانم چگونه، اما نمی فهمم چرا."
569,Joaquín Jiménez,"Uno de los mejores libros que he leído. Al igual que ""Un Mundo Feliz"" de Huxley, 1984 se encuentra bajo el dominio de una administración estrictamente organizada, con la permanente mirada del Gran Hermano, una especie de figura totalitaria y -se presume- jamás existió, pero funciona bajo la lógica de una especie de Dios omnipotente, que no es más que un grupo de gente que quiere el poder.El libro, más allá de invocar y hacer recordar al mundo entreguerras y a aquellas figuras carismáticas de los bloques soviéticos, esboza que el seguir tus ideales propios e incluso pensar en ir en contra de los pensamientos del Gran Hermano significa la muerte inmediata. Pero esta muerte, como lo expone el personaje principal del libro, va más allá de lo físico y lo terrenal, ya que supone ser una defunción de tus pensamientos, de lo que crees, de tus recuerdos, de lo que crees estar seguro, de un todo. "
570,Fatih,"Okumakta geç kaldığıma hayıflandığım eserlerden biri. Sadece ürkütücü bir dünya çizmekle kalmıyor Orwell günümüz dünyasına da ışık tutuyor. 65 sene öncesinin şartlarıyla, adeta insanın her saniye izlendiği günümüzü öngörmesi takdire şayan bir zekayı işaret ediyor. Ütopya denilince akla gelen eserlerin en başında neden 1984'ün geldiğini okuyunca daha iyi anladım.Son zamanlarda okuduğum beni adeta kitabın atmosferine çeken kitapların başında geliyor 1984. "

573,Christopher Wagoner,"There's a reason this book is considered required reading for polisci majors. If you can get past the relentlessly depressing tone you will find great wisdom as well as a compelling narration that makes you keep turning the pages in spite of the fact you know things will not end well.There are torture scenes that are very difficult to read, and near the end the novel breaks down into an almost ludicrous amount of cruelty perpetuated by the state.If you want to truly understand words you probably use frequently--doublespeak, Orwellian, and ingsoc- you'll want to check this one out."
574,Lisa ,"Imagine a world where your every move is noted...A world where your every deed is watched...A world where your every word is heard...A world where even your thoughts are known...A world where history is malleable...A world where anybody can turn you in, at any moment...BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING!"
575,Paul Burnsworth,I'm not sure if this review has any spoilers or not to be honest.This book was awesome. Everyone said it was awesome and they were all right. That ending though.. How depressing. As I was reading I noticed I was running out of pages but the ending in my mind wasn't unfolding so I began to figure out what the ending might possibly be but I never dreamed he would do what he did. There's a lot of subtext in the book that really makes you think about the meanings and reasons for what's happening and what's being said. I'd recommend this book to everyone.

580,María,"Está clasificada como ficción distópica, aunque yo casi que cambiaría la distopía por una ucronía. Vale, os preguntaréis de que estoy hablando. Las distopías suelen suceder en un futuro, normalmente bajo un Estado autoritario, pero como bien he dicho, las distopías suelen ocurrir en un futuro, y tal y como el título del libro nos hace ver, la historia transcurre en el año 1984, y eso es pasado. Aunque si lo miramos desde el punto de vista del escritor, para el si es un futuro, porque fue escrito en 1948.La ucronía, se usa también en la literatura, pero, se caracteriza por el cambio de un punto en el pasado, que ahora hace que todo sea completamente diferente a como es en realidad (o como debería haber sido).Resumiendo, para el autor es una distopía, para mi, ahora que han pasado muchos años, lo considero una ucronía.Bueno, ya vale de tecnicismos, que os aburro. Aquí habéis venido a saber que me ha parecido el libro, y no hace falta que os lo diga cuando en el apartado ""Reseñas"" veáis que le doy el asterisco.Es imprescindible, y aunque sea un libro con connotaciones políticas, creo que no tienes por qué evitarlo. No hay más que verme a mi, que odio la política y sin embargo, lo pongo como imprescindible.Pero quizá eso sea porque la política se ve desde los ojos de los que la ""sufren"", ves como manipulan las informaciones para que el Gran Hermano siempre lleve la razón y sus predicciones sean no solo acertadas, si no que más optimistas de lo que había predicho. Ves como castigan a todo aquel que ose pensar diferente, pensar que quizás haya gente que están contra el sistema, un castigo duro y amargo, en una sociedad donde el amor no está permitido como tal y donde no te puedes fiar ni de tus propios hijos. Controlados todo el día por una pantalla que les dice lo que tienen que hacer y cuando, la sociedad vive con el miedo de que un solo gesto pueda hacer intuir que estén tramando algo.Novela un tanto cruda, donde Winston, un hombre que perdió a su familia nadie sabe como y que ahora está perdiendo su fe en el Gran Hermano, conoce tras mucho desconfiar a Julia, una chica morena que está afiliada a la liga Anti-Sex, pero que realmente, aparenta ser lo que no es. Todo cambia en sus vidas cuando Julia le entrega disimuladamente a Winston un papelito. Pero Winston no teme por eso, si no por algo que esconde en su casa por lo que podrían incluso llegar a matarlo. A partir de ahí se forma lo que menos me gusta en las distopías, una relación amorosa."
581,Zachary Maynard,"The “old book” 1984 is Gorge Orwell’s imaginative future. Note that this book was published in 1950. Orwell was thinking solely on what might happen 30 years into the future. Orwell might have been able to see the much different future if he didn’t neglect his lung infection. That’s too bad as he was a brilliant man. I realize that I jump the gun by reading this before high school.The man charter Winston is living in this dis-utopian future where everyone has a job, where they live in England. Big Brother is our main head honcho if you would. Big Brother is our “leader in this dis-utopia.” There are the principles of INGSOC, which state things like: doublethink. Doublethink is a way to say don’t think if you would. This happens because this dis-utopian future there is no crime, expect for one: thought crime. Thought crime is where a person thinks out of the box, and when they’re caught, the die. They die in a way that says, they never existed.I enjoyed this book fully. Now with a deep understanding of why this book is required to be read in high school. I look forward to rereading this when I go into college. I recommend this book after you read Orwell’s Animal Farm. You really have to be able to think deeply, and thoughtfully when you’re reading this. If you can’t think in deeper ways everything just goes over your head and you just see the shallow surface of the iceberg of deeper meaning that is 1984."
582,Aaron,"Orwell's now classic novel about a world in the grip of insanity. He wrote this in 1948 (from which he derived the title) and was trying to illustrate a potential future in light of the hysteria, fear, and fascism of his day. The world has been carved up by three superpowers who constantly battle supposedly for the last scraps of contested land, but ultimately because constant warfare is the essence of their very existence. Orwell illustrates the mindset that people must adopt in order to survive in this hostile, suspicious world, and through this shows that the human mind and will are much more pliable and flimsy than anyone would like to think. Perhaps more for that reason than anything this book is considered the definitive ""dystopia"" as it shows people deprived of their humanity, and pushed to the point of willingly surrendering it. This books should still be a standard in American classrooms, if only for the way it portray gross semantic distortions (for political purposes). Notably, Smith says, ""How can I help seeing what is in front of my eyes? Two and two are four."" And he is told in response, ""Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once. You must try harder. It is not easy to become sane."" "
583,Noelia ,"Cuando cerré este libro lo único que salió de mis labios fue un ""Waw"". Me encantó profundamente, es un libro que te hace ponerte a pensar del sistema que estamos viviendo porque ¿Es tan diferente al que narra el libro? Personalmente creo que no. Es un libro de esos que todos debemos tener en nuestra estantería! Recomendado notoriamente. Fin del Comunicado."
584,Kristi,so glad i read this in highschool; it enabled me to recognize fiction as life when bush/cheney came to power.
585,guppy,"Since I had to write a review on a book for my English class, I decided to write about 1984.1984 is a fascinating science fiction classic written by George Orwell in the first half of the 20th century. The story is set in future - Orwell's characters live in athe newfangled world of the year 1984, which brings a completely different way of living for people around the planet. The plot focuses on a main character, Winston Smith, who happens to live in society where Big Brother, representing an absolute authority, has the power to observe every single person in the new country, Oceania. Winston is unable to do anything about the unfair situations that surround people, until he meets rebellious Julia who is ready to struggle for humanity. They cannot trust anybody - very little is needed for them to get killed or imprisoned - and no rule can be broken.The characters are very well developed and the story holds the reader's attention. The more I was reading it, the more I could not wait to see what would happen next. Every now and then, a dramatic change occurs in this thrilling novel. At the same time, it is shocking, intriguing and even depressing.It is definitely worth reading this astonishing book, and it is highly unlikely that you will get bored with it. In fact, a lot can be learnt from it - you might change the way you think about things such as power and trust. It is a rather serious story, but still remains understandable and stunning. I would recommend this masterpiece to everyone."
586,Steve Mitchell,"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.” One of the best opening sentences to what is arguably the greatest of all dystopian novels. Set in a world where the Ministry of Truth rewrites history so that it does not contradict the government’s current view, the Ministry of Plenty deals with the shortages of life’s essentials, the Ministry of Peace controls the war and the Ministry of Love tortures and executes dissidents. In a world where even though two and two make four, the population are expected to believe the government if they say two and two make five or three or they can expect a trip to the Ministry of Love where they are ‘vaporised’. Not just executed, the victim is then removed from history by the staff at the Ministry of Truth.Winston Smith is one such man with a knack of adjusting Big Brother’s speeches so that there are no discrepancies in the records with the policy of the time. The problem is that Smith has embarked upon an endeavour that will lead to his own vaporisation; he has started to keep a diary. Smith believes that there is an underground movement – The Brotherhood – intent upon revolution and overthrowing Big Brother that he is determined to join.Orwell’s masterpiece of the horrors of a totalitarian state is one of the best examples of a book that fits the description of essential reading. This is the book that people are most likely to claim to have read when they have not so as not to appear an outcast! (In fact somebody claiming to have read Nineteen Eighty-Four is more likely to be lying!) These people obviously do not appreciate that Big Brother is watching them or are not worried that, “The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thing in the world.”"
587,Hani,كتاب يصدمك بمقدار جهلك بأنك جاهل بالواقع وسط خيلائك بكذبة المعرفة.ليس مجرد كتاب... هو نبوءة لا ينقطع عنها الوحي. 
588,Mike Meathook,"this book absolutely crushed my soul. 10/10, 2+2=5."
589,Heidi Whurr,"A man's worst enemy is himself. A man's hardest fight is against himself. The hardest enemy a man must forgive is himself. How does one accept and forgive what is brutal, cruel, harmful, deadly, and a painful, merciless, wicked abomination of humanity? Man stands on the edge of a cliff weeping in agony, wondering whether to end it or not while the monster behind him, inside of him, laughs at him. Maybe 1984 wasn’t making this point, but this is what I got from it. It wasn’t only a fantastic book about politics, society, and wickedness beyond the mind, but it could be applied to what is inside of a man too. Big Brother is a man’s torment and suffering, the things man loves to hate that will always catch up with him one day and he will either learn to accept them things and forgive them, or they will torture him to his death in some unimaginable way. Winston’s only escape was when he finally learned to love Big Brother, as man’s only escape from suffering is acceptance of it, even if it kills him in the end. Truly wonderful! Quote Orwell: “A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one’s will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic.”“He had stopped because he was frightened. A bowed, grey-coloured, skeleton-like thing was coming towards him. Its actual appearance was frightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself.”“Two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.”Literary perfection.From the moment I picked this book up I could not put it down. I did not find it depressing, as others had described it to me before I picked it up. In fact I found it enlightening, and inspiring and I feel I learned a lot about myself from reading it. George Orwell was a very talented author. His style of writing is easy to read and to picture, and yet at the same time it is poetic, sentences rhyme and are colourful, creating vivid images. I have rarely read anything so pleasurable and that has stuck so solidly in my mind. Orwell often refers to smells in his text, very clever considering our sense of smell is connected directly to our emotions centre and thus whilst reading it, I am driven to feel strongly towards what he writes. He also keeps dialogue to a minimum, economising on words brilliantly, to create a hard, cold and aloof feel, which radiates throughout the entire book, perfect for the overall atmosphere orwell was aiming for. Fantastic, and one of my favourite books of all time. I recommend this to anyone to read. "

592,Sam Barnes,"“He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.”Before I knew that I would study it for school, I bought this with the intent to read it. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as it is one of the most talked about dystopian novel of all time. I enjoyed the storyline and overall plot of this book, but had one problem; I felt as if Winston didn't even love Julia. Julia approached him saying 'I love you', but Winston never really said it back, or acted like it. Although they had sex many times and risked it all, I still felt as if Winston didn't love her. Other than that, I throughly enjoyed 1984; I enjoyed Orwell's writing style, the themes present (anti-totalitarianism, oppression and war). One thing I enjoyed the most was the ending; the breaking down of Winston's soul was raw and hard to read, and the last line, ""He loved Big Brother"" really hit home that the people had no freedom in their own life."
593,Faisal Noor,"A Brilliantly written masterpiece, this book made me lose hope, for a while. It ends somewhat like ""one flew over the cuckoo's nest"" but not without first giving the reader a broader perspective upon society from bird's eye vantage point."

598,Aislinn,"This book really is incredible. It's not a rainbows and sunshine type of novel, so if you plan on reading it, prepare for something that's a bit dark and depressing. Having said that, it has become one of my all-time favourite novels and will definitely stay with me forever."
599,Martha Smith,"A dystopian novel about Oceania, a society ruled by the oligarchical dictatorship of the Party. Life in the Oceanian province of Airstrip One is a world of perpetual war, pervasive government surveillance, and incessant public mind control, accomplished with a political system euphemistically named English Socialism (Ingsoc), which is administrated by a privileged Inner Party elite. Yet they too are subordinated to the totalitarian cult of personality of Big Brother, the deified Party leader who rules with a philosophy that decries individuality and reason as thoughtcrimes; thus the people of Oceania are subordinated to a supposed collective greater good. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a member of the Outer Party who works for the Ministry of Truth (Minitrue), which is responsible for propaganda and historical revisionism. His job is to re-write past newspaper articles so that the historical record is congruent with the current party ideology. Because of the childhood trauma of the destruction of his family — the disappearances of his parents and sister — Winston Smith secretly hates the Party, and dreams of rebellion against Big Brother.As literary political fiction and as dystopian science-fiction, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a classic novel in content, plot, and style. Many of its terms and concepts, such as Big Brother, doublethink, thoughtcrime, Newspeak, and memory hole, have become contemporary vernacular since its publication in 1949. Moreover, Nineteen Eighty-Four popularised the adjective Orwellian, which refers to official deception, secret surveillance, and manipulation of the past in service to a totalitarian or manipulative political agenda."
600,Emlyn Chand,"Preview…Admittedly, it has been a few years since I last read George Orwell’s grim prediction for the future “1984”. This was one of those rare gems that was both entertaining enough to have read within a 24 stretch and meaningful enough to have left an indelible mark upon my mind. Our hero, Winston, lives in a totalitarian state run by Big Brother. Wherever he goes, he is monitored by television screens and by his peers. The worst crime anyone can commit is to have a thought against the party; yes, even thoughts are punishable offenses. ﻿A seed of mistrust for the government enters Winston as he realizes that the government is altering history and lying to he and his fellows. Love for another, Julia, cements his hatred for the party, and together the pair seeks out entrance into a secret society, the Brotherhood, which aims to overthrow the party.One unlucky misstep leads to capture and imprisonment in the brainwashing facility, the Ministry of Love. Months of torture all lead up to Winston’s entry into the dreaded Room 101 where he must face his most horrifying fear. Will Winston continue to oppose the party or will the events that unfold inside of Room 101 cause him to accept the party and its vision for society? This is one novel that everyone should have under their literary belts.You may like this book if… you enjoy reading dystopian novels, you are interested in politics, history, sociology or the like, you are class conscious, you are a Marxist or Conflict Theorist, you are intrigued by the logic of contradiction, you enjoy dark novels, you like thinking “what if”, you are puzzled by the odd Apple Macintosh commercialYou may not like this book if… you have no interest in a book with many layers of meaning, it is difficult for you to imagine such a dark future, you approve of totalitarianism, you believe that love conquers all, you are afraid of rats"

602,David Greene,"1984 by George Orwell is one of the most amazing books I've ever read. Initially, I was required to read this as extra credit for my school, but I was soon perusing it out of my own interest. Orwell is such a phenomenal writer and throughout the first two parts of this novel, I was absorbed into the storyline. (view spoiler)[Then, in the third part, I was beyond crestfallen due to how it ended. In fact, I was angry at how it ended because even though I knew that it was a dystopia and Orwell would end 1984 on a hopeless note, I didn't realize just how much the final page would affect me. After finishing the book, I wanted to throw it against the wall and hate Orwell for ""ruining"" such an amazing book. After a lot of thinking, though, I finally decided that I reacted exactly how he would have expected and wanted me to. (hide spoiler)] The afterward by Erich Fromm was insightful and informative; after reading this book, one should read it because his commentary shines a perspective light on contemporary society, even with it being written decades ago.In conclusion, I highly recommend this novel for anyone interested in Science Fiction and thought-provoking books."

607,Morpheus,"If you're into suspenseful dystopian books then 1984 is definitely for you. This amazing read tell the tale of a oppressive society that is structured through unknowingly ironic figures. For example the name of the controlling government is Big Brother whom watches you at all times through cameras known as telescreens. This oppressive government is similar to the how the Catholic church used to abuse religion and persuade people into conforming through aggressive yet tactical methods. Everyone in the society is so oblivious to being oppressed that they actually believe they are living happy lives, but not Winston, the protagonist of the novel. He has become tired of the pointless monotony, which is extremely dangerous since you are constantly being supervised. This story is eye opening because it has a vast amount of similarities to the world that us Americans live in today. "
608,Bruno Lichtnow,"Amiúde relacionada entre as maiores obras da literatura universal, o livro “1984” foi concebido pelo escritor de origem indiana George Orwell no ano de 1949. Desde sua publicação, a obra vem suscitando intensas reflexões científicas acerca dos vínculos porventura estabelecidos entre Linguística, Ciência Política e Direito. A razão para esse debate se funda tanto no fato de que o governo totalitário retratado pelo autor utilizou-se de mecanismos lingüísticos com o objetivo de eliminar a liberdade de expressão de seus cidadãos e inviabilizar o avanço social por meio de revoluções políticas, quanto em função de que o fenômeno jurídico se traduz em instrumento de controle social propriamente dito.Deveras, consoante se extrai da linha de intelecção tecida pelo filólogo norte-americano Noam Chomsky, todo ser humano possui predisposição genética para desenvolver alguma técnica de comunicação interpessoal e os idiomas constituem o mecanismo que determinada comunidade humana encontra para concretizar na realidade fenomênica essa aptidão inata. Trata-se, em verdade, da explicação científica para a verdade cristã contida na estória bíblica da “Torre de Babel”. Do mesmo modo, torna-se evidente, a partir desse raciocínio, a possibilidade de inexistência de exata correspondência entre vocábulos dicionarizados em determinado idioma em contraste com o léxico adotado por outra língua. Exemplo dessa assertiva consiste na situação “sui generis” protagonizada pelo vocábulo português “saudade”, o qual, conquanto carregue intensa carga emotiva a ponto de merecer atenção especial na poesia, não possui tradução literal em nenhum outro idioma falado no globo terrestre. Cuida-se de apenas um dos problemas sobre os quais se debruça a Semiótica, ciência vocacionada a esclarecer os sentidos e as ligações estabelecidas entre o tripé signo, denotativo da mensagem veiculada, locutor, correspondente ao transmissor do signo, e interlocutor, representativo do receptor do ato de comunicação.A deficiência lingüística característica da “Novafala”, idioma imposto coativamente pelo chefe político “Big Brother” aos cidadãos do Estado de Oceânia, mostra-se em rota de colisão com a concretização de um dos postulados básicos adotados pela Ciência Política em matéria de Democracia: a liberdade efetiva de convicção e de expressão. Isso porque o léxico da “Novafala” foi maliciosamente manipulado com o fim de minar a fecundidade intelectual necessária para a elaboração de qualquer proposta de mudança política, seja paliativa ou mesmo de cunho revolucionário. Ilustração fidedigna da gravidade da situação lingüística dos habitantes de Oceânia repousa no fato de que o novel idioma não admitia o emprego da palavra “livre” no sentido atribuído à expressão “liberdade política”, isso para não mencionar que o vocábulo “pensamento” foi extirpado do léxico do país.Se é verdade que, contra provas, não se erguem argumentos, revela-se necessário mencionar alguns exemplos históricos no que concerne à relevância da capacidade comunicativa de um idioma para a implementação de avanços políticos. Em 1848, um jovem de 20 anos chamado Karl Marx escreveu, juntamente com seu amigo Friedrich Engels, uma obra emblemática na trajetória do pensamento político universal: Manifesto do Partido Comunista. Sob a bandeira traduzida pela expressão “Operários de todo o mundo, uni-vos!”, o marxismo influenciou sobremaneira o pensamento político antanho, tendo sido determinante na formação da ideologia que motivou a eclosão da Comuna de Paris em 1871. Semelhante panorama se apresenta no que concerne à obra intitulada “Mein Kampf”, de autoria de Adolf Hitler e publicada em 1925. O escrito, que revelou idéias anti-semitas, racionalistas e nacional-socialistas, fez as vezes de “manual” para os movimentos políticos liderados pelo ditador.Além disso, cumpre registrar que a linguagem estabelece relações umbilicais com o Direito, o qual pode ser entendido como ciência social incumbida de estudar as normas jurídicas como instrumento de controle social. O fundamento da tese ora esposada repousa no fato de que o Direito, seja por meio de leis escritas, seja por intermédio de costumes estabelecidos, manifesta-se sempre por meio do fenômeno da linguagem. Assim sendo, a deficiência estrutural imposta pelo “Big Brother” ao instituir a “Novafala” prejudicaria tanto o processo legislativo em si quanto a própria interpretação da lei. É que, ao elaborar uma lei injusta, o legislador poderia externar o pretexto de que o idioma inviabilizaria a correta e efetiva regulamentação da vida social. Por outro quadrante, o operador do Direito, ao proceder a uma odiosa interpretação do texto jurídico, certamente se justificaria dizendo que tanto o texto não tem aptidão para expressar coerentemente a realidade, quanto ele próprio, como interlocutor, não teria capacidade para apreender o real sentido da norma jurídica ou mesmo complementar o sentido, o alcance e a finalidade da norma mediante o emprego de outros recursos de interpretação jurídica.Seja como for, verdade é que a análise da obra “1984” paralela ao estudo da Semiótica e do Direito parece descortinar vínculos intimamente estabelecidos e logicamente encadeados entre o livro e as duas ciências sociais. É que, se o Direito é manifestação do poder e da linguagem, por um lado, e a Semiótica é linguagem, por outro quadrante, então a linguagem pode e deve ser entendida também como poder. Contudo, mais do que o singelo poder de convencer, influenciar e entreter, ela traduz o poder de impor determinado desígnio em detrimento da vontade alheia, promovendo emoções e transformações políticas e dando consistência à própria saúde do sistema jurídico."
609,Maria Silva,"Comecei a ler ""1984"" ainda adolescente, e, considerei (na altura) que a visão do futuro era muito pessimista pelo que, voluntariamente, não o acabei de ler. Como não gosto de deixar nada por acabar, retomei a leitura recentemente. Considerando que foi escrito antes de 1950, o autor foi um visionário, fiquei arrepiada da forma como descreve os acontecimentos do regime totalitário. A luta pelo poder, a invasão da mente e corpo das pessoas. A vigilância apertada através da ""teletela"", a manipulação de ideias (apagar o passado), alterar a comunicação com um novo idioma (Novilingua)... Uma obra genial e ainda atual, numa escrita clara é perfeita, para ser lida com calma."
610,Tony,"Orwell was undoubtedly ahead of his time when he wrote this book, so many similarities to today and what what may yet come. Everyone should read this book. The everyday American is now so much like the Proles and the Party and the Inner circle so much like our Government and ""Ruling Class"", and yes if there is any hope it is in the Proles if only they would wake up from placidity and put the necessary change into motion before we truly do find ourselves in an even more uncanny parallel to Orwell's 1984."
611,Yıldız,bir yandan şimdiye kadar okumadığım için pişman olurken sanırım george orwell'in yine harikalar yarattığı bu kitabını da okumak için en iyi zamandı. bir başucu eseri daha.büyük birader ve 2+2=?
612,Jose Ramos,"We generally believe that since we are Americans, we have the luxury of freedoms. Freedom of speech, expression, thought, etc. in George Orwells ""1984"" that is not the case. Orwell details a dystopia eerily similar to the society we live in today. Take for example the ""thought police"". Much like present day National Security Agency (NSA), the thought police worked on behalf of their totalitarian government, to collect the information of citizens. Obviously, the thought police dealt with how people thought, looking for clues of anyone suspected of being a threat to the government and their agenda. Punishment is to the highest degree possible, death or 25 years of forced labor. The government of Oceania consists of four major ministries, equal to today's ""cabinet"" that is a part of the executive branch. The ministry of truth, love, peace, and plenty all handle the governments affairs, while the head of government ""big brother"" is watching the show unfold. In addition to this force, is ""the spies"" which is Oceania's secret police, radicalized by the parties principles. On top of all this senseless power, one is obligated to have a TV in the corner of their house, that way ""big brother"" can see your every move, who's in your house at any time, and see that you're obeying. One must take into account the factors that come with this book and when it was written. As a writer, one is fully aware that through satire and other techniques, the author can express themselves through their work. It is apparent that George Orwell did just that, amidst the global crisis that just followed and was still yet to come. Orwell lived through a time period plagued by war and conflict. He, like most, knew that humanity was on the edge. We had just gone through World War One and two, Vietnam followed, so did assassinations, and other conflicts that would test humanity in some of the darkest hours we have been in. Orwell was aware that soon the discussion of ""trading freedom for security"" was going to rise. In 1984, most people are satisfied with their security although they're forbidden from truly being free. In a sense, they've enjoyed peace of mind at the expense of truly not living. With any regime similar to this one, there is bound to be opposition to the leadership because people are left saying ""what more do I have to lose"". An example would be Emanuel Goldstein, a former prominent member of the party who in the book is considered to be ""enemy of the people"" for betraying the party, going to jail and escaping, and condemning counter revolutionary activities. His faction called ""the brotherhood"" actively engage in activities to seek sabotaging the party and its leadership. He considers himself and the brotherhood ""freedom fighters"" and this inspires Winston to follow in his foot steps. In today's world, he would be the equivalent to Edward Snowden, former NSA official gone rogue after exposing the governments secret, and illegal collection of phone data program. Winston Smith, is your ordinary nobody bureaucrat working on behalf of the ministry of truth, in the records department. He's the guy in the movies who's the nobody least expected to do something crazy like fight a strong leadership, although he does just that. But do his ends justify the means? And was he over ambitious?This book is illustrates a dystopia. It illustrates the consequences of letting power get in the wrong hands. It also illustrates the disastrous and oppressive society one could possibly live in, if one does not engage in fighting for themselves and their people. Orwell wrote this book as a warning sign, demonstrating how far governments are willing to go to achieve their agenda, even if it at the expense of many. Orwell wrote this book to warn us, to make us question our own leadership, to make us think ""what if"", to make us open our eyes, and not willfully and blindly let things occur without the consent of the people. I personally recommend this to anyone who is passionate about their freedoms, and to anyone who would like to see the dangers of not partaking in politics and letting things go on by without questioning ""what if there's a better way to do this"". This book is for those who are comprehend that in order to see the future, we must understand and learn from the past. "
613,Jose,"Opinião também disponível no blog.Escrito e publicado alguns anos após o fim da Segunda Guerra Mundial, George Orwell (pseudónimo de Eric Arthur Blair) apresentou, através da ficção, um arrebatador ensaio sobre os regimes totalitários. Neste livro, o argumento em si, embora importante, fica necessariamente em segundo plano. Não está repleto de acção nem é uma intriga de suspense, tal é o seu carácter político, mas é precisamente neste tipo de carácter que reside a importância de 1984.O autor conseguiu, de forma extensiva mas nada cansativa, focar cada um dos sintomas dos sistemas totalitários, particularmente na primeira das três partes em que o livro é dividido: a censura, a manipulação da informação e do pensamento, a exaltação nacional, a insegurança e a desconfiança em relação aos outros, a repressão sexual (com o único de fim de reproduzir a espécie humana), a tortura...Por outro lado, Orwell criou também um conceito interessante na narrativa, o da novilíngua. Segundo o Partido e o Big Brother, nada mais é do que uma versão da língua aperfeiçoada, reduzida e definitiva. Esta esconde, contudo, uma clara metáfora à ausência da liberdade de expressão e ao controlo do pensamento.É ainda relevante destacar a relação que faz entre os sistemas de classes e a guerra.Este é sem dúvida um daqueles livros que merece toda a atenção que tem, uma vez que, mais do que o interesse pelas personagens ou pela história, é um livro que desafia o leitor a parar um bocado para pensar e questionar, até porque como a certa altura é mencionado, ""the best books are those that tell you what you already know"", mas cujas ideias não sabemos sistematizar."
614,Meta Morfillah,"Judul: 1984Penulis: George OrwellPenerbit: BentangDimensi: viii + 392 hlm, 20.8 cm, cetakan II februari 2014ISBN: 978 602 291 003 9Winston Smith seorang karyawan Partai di Departemen Catatan tiba-tiba saja melakukan hal tak biasa. Ia mencoba menuliskan catatan harian pada sebuah buku. Tindakannya itu bisa terkena disiplin berat bila tertangkap oleh polisi pikiran, teleskrin, dan mikrofon tersembunyi. Saat memulai tulisannya pun, Winston gamang akan tahun yang sedang dijalaninya saat itu. Ia mengira-ngira bahwa itu adalah tahun 1984. Sangat sulit bagi siapa pun di masa itu untuk mengingat waktu, kronologis suatu peristiwa, atau kenangan masa silam. Sebab semua telah dikendalikan oleh partai. Tidak ada kebebasan. Semua tingkah lakumu dipantau oleh teleskrin, kata-katamu disadap oleh mikrofon tersembunyi, dan sedikit saja ada keengganan mematuhi aturan partai--yang bisa diindikasikan dari mimik wajah serta kalimat yang kauucapkan--maka polisi pikiran akan menangkapmu tengah malam, saat kau tertidur. Lalu bersiaplah untuk diuapkan. Yaa... kamu akan ditiadakan, segala jejakmu akan dihapuskan hingga tak ada yang merasa pernah mengingat eksistensimu. Semua media dikuasai dan menjadi alat propaganda. Berkali-kali masa silam diedit sesuai keinginan partai atau Bung Besar.Sepanjang hidupnya, Winston berusaha menaati peraturan dengan baik hingga hari itu, hari di mana ia membeli buku harian dan hari di mana ia menerima pesan singkat dari seorang gadis bernama Julia yang mengaku mencintainya. Perlahan, antipati terhadap kediktatoran partai yang lama bersemayam di hati dan pikirannya menjelma menjadi tindakan pelanggaran. Ia dan Julia menabrak batas-batas namun tetap melaksanakan tugasnya dengan baik. Mereka menganggap itu adalah sebuah pemberontakan terhadap partai. Namun ternyata polisi pikiran berada di mana-mana, termasuk di kalangan kaum proletar yang miskin. Mereka pun tertangkap dan menjalani hukuman di kamar 101 dan berakhir dengan pertobatan pikiran.Membaca novel ini tanpa tahu konteksnya menurut saya tetap menarik, sebab terasa seperti cerita fantasi. Terbayang adegan film divergent, escape, hingga hungry games. Lalu saat saya membaca tentang pengarangnya, bahwa ini adalah novel terakhir yang ditulisnya sebelum meninggal di tahun 1950, di mana saat itu perang tengah dahsyat. Saya teringat bom atom di Nagasaki dan Hiroshima, serta rezim Nazi dan uni soviet, kekacauan di mana-mana. Maka novel ini semakin bertambah nilainya bila ditempatkan dalam konteks masa itu. Bukankah pengarang begitu berani menggambarkan keadaan sebuah negara dengan kediktatoran terhadap warganya serta tokoh-tokoh yang sangat apa adanya, juga waktu yang sebenarnya merupakan masa depan saat novel ini dicetak. Bayangan masa depan tahun 1984 di tahun 1950. Tentu saja berbeda bila kita mengira novel ini relevan sepanjang masa. Mungkin ada pula anggapan novel ini tidak lagi up to date. Kembali, kalau menempatkan konteksnya, novel ini menurut saya hebat. Penulisnya benar-benar cerdas memikirkan sejauh itu tentang konsep negara di masa depan.""Segala sesuatu kabur menjadi kabut. Masa silam dihapus, penghapusannya dilupakan, dusta menjadi kebenaran."" (Hlm. 92)Mengerikan juga membayangkan begitu kuasanya partai mengendalikan sejarah dalam seluruh aspek media. Bahkan ditegaskan dalam novel ini, satu koran times bisa ditulis ulang sebanyak 12 kali, dengan alasan penyesuaian. Hingga bahasa pun dikerucutkan menjadi lebih sedikit, partai menginginkan keseragaman total, tak ada seni, tak ada sastra, semua dirangkum dalam bahasa kaku bernama Newspeak.""... Akhirnya, kelak mereka akan melihat Anda seperti apa adanya Anda, lalu mereka akan mencabik-cabik Anda."" (Hlm. 333)Kalimat itu menunjukkan perlawanan seorang warga yang dalam novel ini diwakili oleh Winston terhadap rezim partainya. Menyiratkan kemuakan akan semua dusta yang dijejalkan.""Satu-satunya kepastian ialah bahwa ajal tidak pernah datang pada saat yang terduga dan diharap."" (Hlm. 345)Ditutup dengan ending yang cukup tragis. Meski ada sedikit typo, tapi saya suka dengan gaya bahasa Orwell yang mudah dipahami, meski yang disampaikan sesungguhnya amat berat.Saya apresiasi 5 dari 5 bintang.Meta morfillah"
615,April (The Steadfast Reader),"A dystopian classic! This is another one of those books that I revisit every few years. If I had three words to describe it they would be, 'dark','gritty',and 'terrifying'. Orwell's very description of a future London envelopes the entire book and permeates every cranny. I can almost taste the oily gin that Winston throws back. I can SEE the proletariate prostitutes making their living. I feel the monotony of Winston's work and the paranoia that comes with living in such a society. This book allows you into Winston's skin. It gets under YOUR skin. Wonderful."
616,Scott Jeremy Nino Roberts,The book seems interesting. I give this book 5 stars.
617,Josh,"I can't believe that I waited so long to read 1984. Very good read that has great significance even for our future. If no dates were ever mentioned, I could see thinking that this book was written during the present day and for our future. There was a point in the book- most readers know the point- when I knew what Winston Smith's fate was, but I can also see how being human in an in-human world could lead you astray. Feelings and emotions can do that. There were points where I wanted to reach into the story and slap him. The great detail in everything from the raw lust to the torture really plays on all the emotions. The Orwellian society portrayed in this book is, of course, an extreme example, but it also leads the reader to a sort of enlightenment about what the future could hold. It's left up to us, the reader, to interpret it how we see fit, but many situations that occurred in this story play themselves out every day in various parts around the world. I though it was a very well written book that is even better for the free-thinking and open-minded. "
618,Carson,"George Orwell creates a dystopian world where in a little before 1984 BIG BROTHER shall rule. Of course, no one has ever seen him, but he exists in all minds of the party. One who controls the past controls the future. Winston disagrees with the government environment. If only he could rebel. How do you rebel without being noticed when you are watched 24/7 at your own home. You can't even trust your own children, in fear they will turn you into the government. People disappear and are never seen again. Winston must find a way to rebel and fast!""If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever.""I give this book five stars because it is the best. It has political meanings and more. It is one of those books that mean something different to each and every person. Although 1984 has passed by years ago, doesn't mean it is not a really amazing book with possible predictions of the future. For those of you who have read George Orwell, this is another book about politics with a twist of imagination. There only three chapters in this whole book, but that doesn't mean they are short and sweet. They are about hundred pages each. I couldn't put this book down. A story of love, hate, and action. Sounds like a fairytale, but it's not for me to judge. Read it and you will fall in love with this work of art."
619,Andrea Ratti,"Orwell �� assolutamente geniale. E' riuscito a creare una distopia perfetta, che se calata nella realt�� odierna, la rappresenta in tutti i suoi aspetti! Assolutamente geniale! Colgo l'occasione per citare una delle frasi a mio parere pi�� caratteristiche di tutto il libro:O'Brien: E tu, ti consideri forse un uomo?Winston: S��.O'Brien: Se tu sei un uomo, Winston, tu sei l'ultimo uomo. La tua specie �� estinta; noi ne siamo gli eredi. Ti rendi conto che sei solo? Tu sei fuori della storia, tu non esisti."
620,Neil Collins,"I wanted to read this book when I was in my early teens but didn't have the patience at the time. I put it off for years. I am so glad that I read it now that I am older and have had time to develop an interest in social/political issues. This book has a profound way of illustrating the blind spots of our own culture. Especially important in the context of recent leaks about the NSA spying, etc. There are so many parallels between the world painted in this book and the world we find ourselves in now. The details of oppression may be different but the ability to control peoples' thoughts through the media is the same. This book serves almost as a vaccine shot into the social organism. Highly recommended. "
621,Parthiban Sekar,"“Inequality was the price of civilization.”Isn't it true that all men are not same based on their native talents or socioeconomic status? The ever-alluring daydream or idea (for optimists only) of ""an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of brotherhood, without laws and without brute labor, has been haunting the human imagination for thousands of years"". However, thanks to our governing bodies and ruling classes, our earthly paradise still seems to be forbidden to us. And the paradisiacal hope has been ever eluding us, owing to Napalm rains and missile storms, vengeful visits of Little Boy and Fat Man, and age-old lustful imperialism and perverse colonialism... Have we lost the hope of our paradise forever?“How does one man assert his power over another?““By making him suffer.”Because, Obedience alone is not enough and Power has the pressing urge to control and command over the people...us. Imagine a system which is built on hatred rather than frivolous things like values, love, and other mindless things, and which has no room for any humane emotions except for fear, rage, self-abasement, and imbecile triumph of their ruling class/ party over their distant and probably-nonexistent enemies. Here, in this so-called system, when your eyes well up with tears and before you shed a tear, your glass would be filled with a fresh serving of liquor (as if that is going to help). And if you think something uncommon or against the BIG BROTHER i.e. the brute face of the ruling class, whom everyone is supposed to revere and unconsciously love, you are likely to visit the windowless multistory building, and , if found guilty, infernal ROOM 101 which is the end-point of the filthy lives... of OCEANIA, the system of HATRED...UNCONSCIOUSNESS! “Orthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.” The BIG BROTHER might have only one face, ALWAYS WATCHING YOU!, but he has a million pair of hands and minds which continuously work on manipulating the present and erasing the past, a million pair of boots marching all over the country and kicking aberrant innocents. The desire to be alone, leaving out the long-gone past and unimaginable future, is tantalizing when one has to suppress his feelings, harden his emotions, and do what everyone else does... And especially when one believes that ""Things had once been different"". It is the not cruelty and insecurity of the Modern Life, which drives one to the cliff, but simply its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness. And Pushing an inconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing...“The greater the understanding, the greater the delusion; the more intelligent, the less sane.”In the locked loneliness of People, or as in NewSpeak (Official Language of Oceania), Comrades, they pay the price for their happiness (which they are forced to believe to be in) with their FREEDOM and THOUGHTS, which they would otherwise think, if not for ThoughtPolice and ThoughtCrime. Science has been disposed as some frivolous idea. The fields are cultivated with horse-ploughs while books are written by machinery. The idea of Individualism and eccentricity has disappeared even from the books. People are being robbed of their basic right to think what they want, and love who they want, thereby forcing them to live in Love-Lost and Sex-Gone-Sour State. Even a secret affair is a political crime and it is hard to escape the ever-watching eyes of BIG BROTHER. People unconsciously succumb to the brute force of the Power, dutifully cheer over the trampling on their invisible enemies, so that they can avoid the boots of BIG BROTHER trampling over them. And thus, living in a state of uncertain future, unclear past, and unconscious present.“If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face — forever”Who can we turn into, at times like this? Can the almighty save us? Can the Spirit of man free us? But, from whom? There are no enemies in Oceania. All are comrades who live in such abundant happiness and unmistakable harmony… only thing they, sometimes, worry about is the lack of supply of cigarettes, shaving razors, and stupid saccharine tablets. “We do not merely destroy our enemies; we change them.”Such is the life of the comrades of Oceania, full of lies, slogging through dreary jobs, saving cigarette and razors, darning a worn-out sock, fighting for a place in the tube, and always living in a state of war with adjacent countries, but not trying to push beyond the limit of annihilation. Because war is not a necessity but a mere show-off of whose-manhood-is-bigger. When the power is busy waging War and triumphing over the defeats of unfortunate and weaker countries, comrades continue to live in a sedated state of happiness, with inexplicable hate for those who raise against the system or even think…""Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.""If you like this book, it is likely that you like this book: Brave New World."
622,Melissa,"	Winston Smith just broke the law. He wrote in a diary, which is punishable by 25 years in a forced labor camp, or even by death. But wait! There is no law, no legalities by which the people in Oceania are controlled by. There are only punishments, vaporizations of random people, who are considered risks to the system of “the Party”. By writing in a diary, Winston was thinking too much. Thought was the Party’s number one enemy, the most difficult thing to control. If Winston were caught, by a loyal party member or the ever-watching telescreen, the Thought-Police would come in his sleep and take him to the Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order, the dreaded place of torture and punishment for any felons of thought-crime.	The irony of this system is prevalent throughout the entire novel. Even more distinctive, however, are the detailed complexities with which Orwell creates this horrific and nightmarish world. His intuitiveness is impressing, but his creativity is mind-blowing. He creates a society n which word-domination seems not only plausible but inescapable. Orwell insists that controlling the world is simply controlling the inhabitants of the world. Not physically, but mentally. The Party, led by an intangible idea personified by the tangible face of Big Brother, controls the minds of the citizens. The people love Big Brother, they love the Party. If they don’t, they can be made to by mixtures of physical and psychological torture.	1984 follows Winston Smith, yet undaunted by the threats of torture, who decides to write in a diary. The story proceeds from there with a psychological plot that chronicles Winston’s growing understanding of the world he lives in. As Winston continues to grasp the monstrous complexities of his society, so will the reader.		This book is not to be read for entertainment, for none will be found within these pages, but for enlightenment. Orwell gives the reader an invaluable glimpse into the effects of such a terrible society, but mainly a glimpse into the deep psychological methods necessary to control the minds of an entire human race. This is a very valuable glimpse that should be taken by any readers who dare to tap into the terrible imagination that drives this literary classic."
623,Jonathan Dubé,"Très bon livre, une mise en garde d'une autre époque envers les dangers de la perte de notre langue. L'une des meilleures démonstrations littéraires que notre capacité de penser provient absolument de notre capacité de mettre nos idées en mots. À relire d'ici quelques années."
624,Ankit Patel,"Never have i come across a more complete and comprehensive description of a dystopian world that George has described in 1984. I started the book being skeptic of it being just another dystopian novel. But by the middle of the book, i realized there's more to this masterpiece than just a random society. As the story progresses, it transcends the realm of novels to being a description of believable, inevitable view of a world all the while presenting intriguing arguments about life, death, love, freedom etc. In short, you won't find any of the fancy gadgets, cool powers and superhumans in this science fiction. Instead, you'll find description of a society so engrossing that'll haunt you for time to come. And note that it was published way back in 1948, so you can marvel at how great a foreseer George was."

626,Ray Palmer,"This is a famous book but until reading it I knew nothing about it other than the phrase ""Big Brother is watching you"". I was surprised by the direction it took in the end.It made me think about how we currently embrace and support an invasive world society. Big Brother doesn't have to impose it on us. The other thing that struck me was how ignorant the masses are, and I include myself in that group. It's impossible for an individual to know even a fraction of the sum of human knowledge. So we are all slaves, in a way, to the sources of information to which we listen, sources as ignorant of the whole as we are ourselves. Our desires to conform and rebel are affected, maybe even controlled, by that information. It's tempting to view rebellion against the status quo as an assertion of individualism. More often than not, it's just a different manifestation of how controlled one is by the status quo.1984 is a book long on exposition. It's a book about ideas. Its most annoying flaw is its reliance on the manic pixie dream girl trope to drive what plot it does have. But still highly recommended."
627,Andres,"No book has ever haunted me like this one did. Thought provoking. Quite possibly one of the most important books of the 20th Century, and quite astonishingly relevant even from the point of view of a time far past the date of Orwell’s projected future. No matter whether one agrees or disagrees, whether one thinks this is possible or impossible, making the mind of a reader work is what makes this a great read. The concept of shrinking the English language as to make Thought Crime impossible was an interesting idea.This isn't the kind of book you read for fun."
628,Andrew,Everything Orwell predicted in 1949 (when 1984 was written) has come about. Eerie and fascinating.

631,Crystal Nemer,"The entirety of 1984 can be summed up with one sentence, the Party line of Ingsoc (English Socialism), which reads: ""Who controls the past […] controls the future: who controls the present controls the past."" (p 34)This novel is a chilling commentary on what the future could be if the world continues in the direction it has been heading for centuries. It warns of the dangers of conformity, ignorance, and government interference in everyday life. Winston Smith, a thin and unhealthy member of the Party, goes about his day rewriting history to tow the Party line and rebelling in small ways as to retain some sense of individuality. He lives his life in fear of being taken in by the Thought Police, who punish all expressions in any way different from what Ingsoc’s current position is. Standard English is slowly being subverted by Newspeak, which replaces current words with unambiguous bastardizations that inhibit free thought. Ignorance is prized and the world is constantly in a state of war.As one of the Party members whose job is to rewrite history to match current Party statements, Winston knows exactly how lies become truth and truth is forgotten. He spends the length of 1984 looking for truth hidden behind the lies and finding it harder and harder to even pretend to conform; joined by his lover, Julia, who encourages him to rebel even further and enjoy life to the fullest – a crime punishable by death. Smith interviews people all around him, attempts to search his own memories through his diary, and goes so far as to read the most forbidden book in the land. This is the final act that lands Winston in the custody of the Thought Police and spells his doom, betrayed by the one person he hoped would lead him to the answers he sought.Even though the year 1984 is long past, there are a frightening number of parallels in modern life and the novel is still very relevant and intriguing. There were many points in the book where things become disjointed and difficult to read, but it is purposeful and well worth reading until the end. The last four words made me cry."

633,Yi Rui Soon,"What a fantastic book that I hope its reality would never come to fruition. Thought-provoking, creepy as hell (because of its sheer likelihood), it deserves a place under the name of ""Must read classics"". Cannot stop raving about it. Even now I'm still in shock HAHA."
634,Andrea,"Ever since the rise of YA dystopian/post apocalyptic literature, I've had a desire to look to the novels that came before the popularity to see where the influences could have possibly stemmed from. I started with Ender's Game, moved on to The Giver series, and now have come to 1984. This is not a book that you can just set aside and forget, not that the same could be said of the former novels. But this one takes government of the people, government of the society, government of the individual-- and send it to room 101. Take ""War is peace, Freedom is slavery, Ignorance is strength"" and think that one out. That was in the first 4 pages, alone. I kept thinking, ""Anyone wanting socialism in our country needs to read this book and look at our history, heck, our present, look at the economy of Greece."" But even that level of thinking is hallowed out and deconstructed within this book. It goes beyond that. It starts and ends with Big Brother's slogans within the individual. This is not a feel-good novel. I am surprised remembering friends tell me that he/she read this in high school. I cannot imagine reading this without learning about philosophy and governments (many things happening in this society have definitely happened in history and probably at present) and deconstruction. There are also some pretty adult situations (nothing too graphic) that make me question whether this should be taught in high school. This is a thinking novel (which I understand the role of a high school teacher wanting students to think--but it's the maturity level that I question at high school level). It is a novel that haunts. It is a novel that questions ""What thoughts are my own?"" ""Am I really an individual?"" ""What is truth?"" and ""How can I possibly stay true to myself?"""
635,4ZZZ,I have read this several times in my life and it has to be considered as one of the greatest pieces of literature this world has ever known. 
636,Cathi,"George Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-four is a Master of horror. Julia and Winston's love story in the era of Big Brother in Oceania is enough to realize how dear our freedom means to us. A twisted tale of everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party watches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the face of the Party’s seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known only as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, even the people’s history and language. Currently, the Party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such thoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes. What rulers will do for power in the futuristic society seems spine chilling and oddly poignant in today's world of ISIS, Burma, Syria and North Korea. "
637,Ala Nasser,"يصور جورج اورويل في هذا العمل الأدبي العظيم مجتمع شمولي يخضع لحزب دكتاتوري باسم الأخ الأكبر وهو ممثل الحزب والوجه الذي تعرضه شاشات الرصد ليلا ونهارا وقد كتبت تحته عبارة ""الأخ الاكبر يراقبك"" كان شعار هذا الحزب ""الحرب هي السلام، الحرية هي العبودية، الجهل هو القوة"" يبني هذا الحزب سلطته علي القمع والتعذيب وتزوير الوقائع التاريخية بحجة الدفاع عن الوطن وعامة الشعب. رواية كما هو معروف قدمها في عام ١٩٤٩ والتي يبدو انه تنبأ بمصير العالم ""عالمنا اليوم"" الذي ستحكمه قوى كبيرة تتقاسم مساحته وسكانه ولا توفر أحلامهم وطموحاتهم بل تحولهم الي مجرد ارقام في جمهوريات الأخ الاكبر الذي يراقب كل شئ ويعرف كل شئ. كانت هذه الرواية في وقت من الأوقات تعد رواية ثورية خطرة سياسيا مما أدى الي منعها في المكتبات في عدة دول كانت تخضع تحت حكومات شمولية روسيا كمثال. ما يبهر في الرواية، ان كل ما تم تخيله فيها هو واقع ويحصل حاليا في اغلب الدول. "
638,AbdulHakim AlHowaish,لا أدري كيف يمكن أن تُصنف رواية كهذه ، إنها ليست بالسياسية البحتة رغم كلّ مافيها من السياسة ولا بالإنسانية رغم مافيها من صراع إنساني ، وليست بالفلسفية رغم العمق الذي يعتريها ، وليست باللغوية رغم التلاعب بالمفردات.أبدع الأستاذ أنور الشامي في الترجمة لابد أن أذكر هذ.نُشرت الرواية في 1949م وهي تتنبأ بما سيحدث في العام 1984م بطريقة رمزية وباعثة للتأمل ، لست هنا بصدد أن أسرد القصة وأذكر تفاصيلها. أريد فقط التركيز على أنّ أغلب ما نحاه الكاتب كان صحيحًا - رغم مبالغاته التي تزيد القصة تشويقًا - لكن العقل الإنساني أمام كل ماكتبه يذهب بالاتجاه نفسه ، عندما تغيب القيم وتصبح السلطة هي لغة الحوار ، تفقد كل الأشياء مصداقيتها ويكون الجنون فقط في مخالفتك للجميع بغض النظر عن صحة مسارهم من عدمه - كما وصفه في بعض أجزاء الرواية -عمق الرواية لا أستطيع أن أصفه هنا ، للحد الذي أجدني مذهولًا وأنا أكتب عنها الآن وكم أدرك خطأ أن تكتب عن شيء وأنت مازلت تحت وطأته إلا إنني لن أندم على ذلك بالتأكيد .الرواية في كفّة وحينما يبدأ وينستون بالقراءة في كتاب غولدشتاين رئيس تنظيم الأخوة ( ياللمصادفة !!! ) في تفسيره عمّا يعتري العالم من أحداث و تأويلات وإلى أين يتجه في كفةّ أخرى ..الرواية موغلة في الرمزية ، لكنها من النوع المحبب الذي يجعلك تغمز للقارئ وترتاح لما يريد أن يوصله ، فهو يقول كل هذا ضمن سياق واحد ومستوى متناسق في الرمزية ، وكأنها لغة موازية ستجد صعوبة في البداية بفهمها إلا أنك مع استمرار القراءة ستتسق معها وتعتادها .في الرواية فصول تشبه التنويم المغناطيسي ، وفيها فصول باعثة للملل ، وفيها فصول صادمة ، وفيها فصول أقل مايقال عنها أنها كاشفة .. لا يخفى على الجميع أن هذه الرواية تُقرأ إلى اليوم بدلالاتها ويُفسّر فيها بعض أحداث واقعنا المعاصر .تجربة رائعة جدًا .

640,Cathy,"1984 was an interesting read for me. I loved how the plot unveiled, and how Winston was able to fall in love with Julia, and then big brother. Obviously, the ending was strange for me, but i think that is what makes the book so striking. Big Brother is present in every chapter of the book and it watch Winston learn to love and accept him in the end. Like Winston I was skeptical about Big Brother in the beginning of the novel. Apart from the overall character development that Winston, I really enjoyed reading about all the strange things that big brother was doing. Changing history, the meaning of words was something that I had never thought about. It was so strange to read about a government that could constantly manipulate events of the past and make them seem real so effortlessly. The people seemed to hopeless. I remember being shocked that people were glad the chocolate ration went up one month, when it actually went down. People were so in love with Big Brother that they believed that 35 was greater than 40. Overall the book is incredibly insightful. Big Brother is the most haunting thing I have ever read about, and even though I know that this is just a book, It seems so real. I think this novel has changed the way I view people with power. I loved reading this novel, and when I distanced myself from the text and took time to think about the text, I loved it even more. "
641,Shaina Leitch,"It was interesting to go back and read a book that I haven't read since high school and was, at the time, forced upon me. I found out that I didn't actually remember this book at all! This is a dystopian book, or as they say in the afterword, ""negative utopia"". I'm really fond of this genre right now and it's even more facsinating when you're reading about a time that has already passed, but that was the future when the book was written. I found the language ""Newspeak"" interesting. The way the so-called government is so power-hungry that they are even taking away the freedom of words and language. I found this book almost like zombies-meet-Fahrenheit451. The way the people follow everything they are told and are so mindless to the world around them and how history has been completely altered and books are destroyed or at least re-written. ***SPOILER***Orwell's book is different than other dystopian novels in the way he ends his story, though. While, we're used to seeing some sort of victory or at least a rise-up against the government, this book ended in defeat. The whole time you're waiting for a turn or some sort of hero. But, it ends worse than it began. "
642,Katie Wilkinson,"This book was recommended to me because I had previously enjoyed novels featuring dystopian societies. I was reluctant to start reading at first and found it quite difficult to become involved in the story, (this, I think was due to not reading a book for leisure in quite some time, not to the book itself), however once I got going, I genuinely could not stop. It is written in such an articulate way, that I started to feel what the characters felt, which I think, is how a book should make you feel. So overall, a brilliant read.And also, the person who recommended it to me was super cool, so that may have also contributed."
643,Hamza,"I wavered between giving this book four and five stars, because the ending was not quite what I expected. After reading the afterword in this particular edition and reflecting upon the themes of the book, however, I realized it was indeed worth every bit of praise as a classic that it receives. Far from being a cliché to give this book such a label, I can think of few works of fiction that deserve it more. I already almost want to reread it, which is not something I say often about novels, even those held in such high regard. I would also be a phony bookworm if I didn't talk about its sheer influence on every bit of negative utopian or dystopian literature that came afterward. This is now possibly one of my favorite novels, better than Animal Farm, and a worthy addition to my collection. If you've been waiting for far too long to read it, as I was until recently, then wait no longer!"
644,Felipe Guerrero,Termine el libro y lo único que puedo decir es: No se supone que fuera un instructivo.Se los juro pagina por pagina es como ver lo que esta pasando en estos días en México y en todo el mundo. Ojala no terminen las cosas como en 1984.
645,Ida,What could I possibly add that has not been praised about this book?Only that its the grandest of the grandest literature.Sir George Orwell could only be a genius.
646,Utkarsh Bajpai,"The very essence of human society hangs on the thin thread to find a meaning for existence. What if such a meaning was taken from you , what if lies and truth were shuffled so often that they were indistinguishable. What if past could be written and overwritten again and again. Orwell describe such a perfect oligarchy, where not only to commit a crime but also to think of a crime is impossible. He shows how permanent peace is obtained through a state of permanent war,how ignorance is strength and freedom is slavery. This is the story of a rebel, Winston who believes things can change. By the end of the book he has lost the ability to think and believe. He is in a state where nothing matters to him and he matters to none. He ends up loving everything he once stood against. A true piece of art,this book is a though stirrer and a must read."

648,Ahmad Al-Maaini,رواية مذهلة، لا أعرف كيف سمحتُ لنفسي أن أؤجل قراءتها طوال هذه السنين. أشعر أنها يجب أن تكون قراءة إجبارية لكل طالب جامعي. عقل فذّ يملكه جورج أورويل.أودّ أيضًا أن أشيد بالترجمة الجميلة لأنور الشامي. واحد من أفضل المترجمين برأيي.
649,Jess,"I first read 1984 some time in high school, and the only thing I really remembered from it was the phrase ""double plus ungood"" which I would actually use in my own speech rarely and whimsically from that first reading almost a decade ago.I recently came across a post on reddit where someone quoted some newspeak, and I felt the desire to pick up the book again.I won't try to write a huge essay on the book (I'm sure I did one back in school heh).The book was great, even still to this day. I don't feel like it's dated at all, and that this future dystopia could still be something that can (shiver) occur in our future."

651,Lee Porteous,"I did not expect to love this book as much as I did. I am always a little wary when it comes to what is considered a ""Classic"". However this book picked me up and ran with me all the way to the end. i could not put it down. I was spending my nights with my head buried in it to see what would happen to Winston.The only time I felt anything was a bit laborious was reading the Goldstien part as I felt I had picked most of that up myself from how the party was run but then with what happens after I realised it was a necessity to read that propaganda.A brilliant book that I can't recommend enough and I will definitely not be so hesitant about a ""Classic"" book in the future."
652,Cristina,"I have no words to describe this book. I read it with terror. Terror that within it lies truth about our existence. Terror that a human mind can actually think of all these monstrous ways in which to inflict pain, not only in the physical level, but also on the inside, in the subconscious level. I can only hope that the spirit of the man will overpower the need for power, and that the world will always aim for freedom. How foolish "
653,Emily,"Nineteen Eighty Four is, in my opinion, one of the best books ever written. The story is well known; a communist government ruling over the super-continent Oceania. Big Brother is the totalitarian leader. A member of the Outer Party, Winston Smith, begins to question the system. This book is mind-blowing, it's wonderful. And I preferred it to Animal Farm. Animal Farm is a masterpiece, but I prefer this. I even liked the fifty pages of theory. This book is brilliant, it's so captivating. Everyone must read this. "
654,Gigi Zarazua,"1984 was one of those books that was way too good to put down but when you got to the end, just made you pull your hair out. What I liked about this book was that it had to do with a civilization that is controlled completely by its government and everyone but a few people are immune to it. Winston was one of those people who did not believe everything Big Brother told them. I liked how he found things out and slowly but surely put the pieces together to find the bigger picture. What I disliked about the book was how despite everything Winston went through, it ended with him loving Big Brother! The whole point of the story was how much Winston hated Big Brother and didn't want anything to do with it, but because he was tortured to the point where he would do anything to save himself, he ended up loving Big Brother. The part that I absolutely loved also was when he ends up betraying Julia! They were supposedly in love with each other and would do anything for each other but in the end, they ended up giving each other up which I did not expect. 1984 had me feeling many emotions throughout the story like excited, surprised, mad and sad. I love the way the author wrote this novel because there are so many turning points that you did not expect and it just keeps you constantly surprised. Overall, the book is amazing."
655,Phil Smith,"What can anyone say about this book that hasn't been said by other, more articulate people over the past six decades? It is, quite simply, scary. Granted, other characters may well have gone through ordeals that rival Winston Smith's. Torture is hardly new. Deprivation has been making the rounds for centuries. But then you could say that about any concept or idea. It's how you put them together and see them through to their logical conclusion that matters, and this work sees Orwell at the height of his powers.I'm sure you've all heard about how prescient the book is, how such concepts as eternal war as a way of keeping people distracted from their own wretchedness, total surveillance and other such things are all predicted here with chilling accuracy, so I shan't spend too much time repeating that. Why reinvent the wheel?The sheer level of detail in this book is astounding. Orwell uses plain and simple language and puts the reader right there in Airstrip One. The stench of overcooked cabbage, the bitter chill, the shortages: everything about the austerity years is writ large and even though we've not had a situation like that in the West for years now, this book at least gives us all a taste of what it must have been like.If any part of this book is really hard going, it's the 'excerpts' from The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism. It steers the reader away from Winston, Julia, o'Brien and co and straight into a very dry analysis of what might be the history of Oceania. Although that secret history might well have been fabricated (hooray for unreliable narrators) it does at least put it all in some kind of context. Stick with it.The last part of the story is particularly quotable. It's almost impossible to review 1984 without spouting one of the old favourites: 'we are the dead', 'a boot stamping on a human face — for ever'. Winston's exchanges with o'Brien in Room 101 make for particularly compelling reading and I defy anyone to try not to read it through in one sitting.If any one piece of fiction should be made required reading at every school on the planet, it's this book."

657,Mohammed Al-Garawi,"Brilliant, amazing, and mind-blowing. This is one of the best books of all time. I don't remember the last time I loved a book this much.I'm not a big fan of taking one concept to an extreme and making that the main premise of a story. However, Orwell did that in a magnificent way.Those who talk/write about the conspiracy theory all the time make me sick, and using it in a book only for the sake of using it kills the book and makes it cheesy. But the way Orwell used that was perfect. He forecasted the future in 1948 and came with the prophetic, nightmarish vision of the year 1984, creating a negative utopia.The story takes place in a world where there are only three countries that are in constant state of war to ensure that the resources of the world are constantly consumed, in order for the standards of living for the masses never increase, rendering them oblivious.The country the story takes place in is governed by a party that convicts for thoughts, that monitors every single movement of its citizens, putting them under the mercy of the thought police. A party that makes no distinction between the thought and the deed. A party that sees nothing but degradation of the masses.This party is based on the firm idea that ""The Party"" is power, and individuals are mere cells that, alone, are of no importance or significance, and their weariness is the vigour of the organism. A party with the slogan ""Freedom is slavery"". The freedom of individuals that is. Because every human being is bound and doomed to die, which is the greatest failure. However, merging oneself with the party so that they ARE the party, will make them infallible, all omnipotent and immortal.The book discusses many philosophical ideas and uses the foundation of some philosophical doctrines, such as solipsism.It also discusses the idea that ""Nothing exists beyond human consciousness"" in one of the main principals of this party by the idea that The Party thinks that power is not in controlling the material world. That it believes that sheer and absolute power is in controlling the mind. And by controlling the mind, everything can be restrained and managed, including weather, diseases, laws of nature, and every single thing in our material world. For that the material world is nothing but an external reality that lies in and subjective to our brains.This book is just brilliant. It's unorthodox and beautiful at the same time.It also just happened that I watched the movie ""V For Vendetta"" when I was half away through this book. For some reason, I have a feeling that the original comic, the movie was based on, was inspired by this original.WOW I WROTE AN EFFING BOOK!!! :|"
658,Ian,"Genuinely nightmarish. So prescient in its depiction of a surveillance society, so accurate in its description of the way socialism was fundamentally flawed, so true in the manner of crushing the individual. The fact that my Room 101 would be similar to Winston Smith's made it all the more terrifying. War is peace. Slavery is freedom. We are the Dead."
659,Joana Doko,"One of the best books I have ever read. So intense, so involving, so real... I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes reading and thinks is brave enough except the bitter truth. Like Orwell said himself ""The best books are the ones that tell you something you already knew"". This book was no surprise for me, because I have read about dictatorship before, but no other book has been this honest with me before. I totally loved it. Nothing I would have done differently. I was terrified, I cannot trust anyone anymore like I did before this book. Careful, Big Brother is watching you... "

661,Nina Wren,"Nineteen Eighty-four by George Orwell is a classic well worth the read. The novel depicts a futurist setting of the year 1984 during which the society of Oceania operates under a totalitarian government. Oceania lives under perpetual war, constant surveillance, and most importantly, mind manipulation through propaganda. Individuals live in fear of the “though police,” and their possible disappearance should they not act obediently or comply with the demands of Big Brother. The protagonist, Winston Smith works in a division of the government, The Ministry of Truth. His job entails falsifying records in order to correspond with the ideology of The Party. However, Winston has long hated The Party’s oppressive force and dreams of taking down Big Brother. Although I was skeptical that this book would merely illustrate the delusional mind of a conspiratorialist, my reluctance vanished as I dove farther into the book. George Orwell provides a rather philosophical tone that simultaneously lets the reader explore the dystopian setting of the novel and subtly pinpoints methods of oppression used by the government as well as the philosophical ideologies of The Party. I was impressed with Orwell’s writing style and pessimistic perspective of the government and society. Overall, I found his viewpoint to be intriguing, though at times his ideas did seem farfetched. I would definitely recommend this book for its illustration of an oppressed society and the will power of one individual against the government. "
662,Astratow,"Rok 1984 to lektura obowiązkowa dla każdego czytelnika gazet i telewidza. Pranie mózgu i manipulacja, jakim jesteśmy poddawani w ""demokratycznej"" rzeczywistości jest faktem, natomiast lektura książki Orwella pozwala spojrzeć na to krytycznym okiem i dostrzec wiele jej elementów. Czy zauważyliście, że w tekstach prasowych używa się słowa ""terroryści"" oraz ""separatyści"" wobec wszystkich niepoprawnych politycznie i sprzecznych z bieżącą polityką ugrupowaniach militarnych, natomiast cieszące się życzliwością mediów zyskują miano ""rebeliantów"", ""partyzantów"", ""bojowników"" czy po prostu ""sił opozycji""? A to wszystko tacy sami bandyci i mordercy.Inny przykład to ""propaganda"" i ""akcja uświadamiania"".Znane? Szukajcie a znajdziecie, kiedy znajdziecie, napiszcie do mnie.Warto zaznaczyć, że owa sympatia mediów, które są zadziwiająco zgodne z państwową polityką, zachodzą zmiany i wówczas moglibyśmy mówić od dwujmyśleniu...Ha! Gorąco polecam refleksję nad rzeczywistością w świetle dzieła Orwella. Być może nie jest to najbardziej porywająca powieść, ale na pewno zawiera bogactwo materiału do przemyśleń, a ten jest bezcenny.

665,Lyuba,"A lot of readers like to dive into horror books in the month of October. Well, 1984 is a very particular horror story, a tale of what might happen in a world where the system is above the individual.Orwell masterfully describes the worst possible dystopia - mass thought control. The novel is divided into 3 distinct parts. In the first one, the main protagonist Winston Smith, an ordinary outer Party member, commits a ""crimethink"" - he questions the reality presented by the Party, desperately yearns to know the truth about the past and hopes that change is possible. He also goes as far as committing outward acts of disobedience: he starts a journal, falls in love and becomes a member of the ""Brotherhood"", a so-called underground dissident movement. In Part II of the novel, Winston, predictably, gets arrested and goes through interrogation and torture, the final goal of which is complete suppression of any independent thought and total brainwashing. In Part II, he wishes for death and expects to be publicly executed. However, sometimes death is not the worst end. In Part III, we see Winston as a shell of a man, completely emptied of any will, rational thought or human emotion. He is a picture of hopelessness, a person so thoroughly crushed by the system that the only way he can function is by getting drunk every day. He exists in a perpetual state of stupor. I think Orwell's portrayal of this horrific ""what-if"" world is genius. It is a standing warning to always beware of any system that discourages freedom of thought/speech, rewrites history or tells people how to think. A must read for everyone."
666,Ject Toons,"La creciente decepción para con la naturaleza del poder y lo sistemático y efectivo del rompimiento del espíritu humano que se experimenta al leer este libro provoca escalofríos. Toda la vida he sabido que este libro es un consabido clásico de las distopias, sin embargo, razono, es un clásico por una razón específica, y esa razón es que a pesar de que muchas de las cosas que son mencionadas son ""obsoletas"" (por tratarse de una novela de principios del siglo pasado), el tema primordial que lidera la historia no es para nada obsoleto. Al contrario, la validez del argumento es tan real que asusta. Finalmente, según afirma Orwell, el ser humano, sus sueños y su espíritu son víctimas del poder creado por él mismo. Y es inevitable pertenecer a ese sistema que nos controla poco a poco. Las convicciones son efímeras, el sueño de libertad una mentira, la guerra la única forma de controlar a la población.Teniendo en cuenta la situación que transcurre actualmente en varios países, y que desgraciadamente seguirá transcurriendo, esta novela parece un retrato de una visión que el autor tuvo del futuro. No sólo pinta a la perfección lugares como la Rusia socialista o la actual Korea del norte, si no que su acertada descripción de la perpetuidad del poder puede ser identificada en países como México, Estados Unidos, y tantos otros... verdaderamente terrorífico. La autodestrucción parece ser el propósito último del ser humano, para solamente ser."
667,Alice Lippart,"Terrifying and fascinating. I especially enjoyed the themes of censorship, brainwashing, independent thought and government surveillance. Though perhaps a little dry in points, this was perfect for me."
668,Helen Stacey,"Love, love, love it! In today's modern age and social media we don't know about where many of our colloquial language comes from. 1984 led the path to coining the term BigBrother, and gives an insight to what we may face in the future or what we are currently experiencing in the modern era. (I only say this because I am a secret conspiracy believer). Be forewarned this classic book does include a subtle tale of forbidden love."
669,Koran Pollard,"One of the best books I've ever read. It's genuinely terrifying and saddening. It remains remarkably original, even in the present day, after having seen everything which took inspiration from it for all these years. It's filled with a depth and detail that most books don't reach. Ideas and themes explored in a proper sense, to more than just make you think about them, but to provide arguments and dialogue. It's most striking feature is the third act (or the section marked as III) that, like any climax, amps up, yet, it doesn't feel like the book is dependant on it, it doesn't feel like the whole thing is a boring build-up towards it. Not at all. Before that there is (SPOILER) Julia and Winston. The romance they have does not feel throwaway or obligatory as it might have, instead, it reflects the coldness of the context and the rebelliousness of the characters. Their relationship, as other parts of the book, may seem so surreal whilst taking in account our reality and our common perceptions, yet feels so real to the world presented in the book. And this consistency is very important. You can connect little threads of Orwell's totalitarian warning with today, in the smallest quantities, and more than that appreciate how back in the day, the text would have connected to the world around them. It is startlingly beautiful in that sense. There is a well-reasoned logic and lunacy to everything. Which is kinds meta considering how the protagonist feels the same way at a certain stage. But the book does that. It involves you into the story so well, yet pulls you out enough. A remarkable thing being (SPOILER) Goldstein's book. We go through the story with Winston's feelings and sure enough the book is just those feelings and thoughts, the very same ones, but makes them more organised and consolidated. This is important as when he says that the book doesn't tell him anything new, we really get what he means. We're really inside his mind. Goldstein's book (and what follows after that) also rigidly gives definition to the slogans and makes them real. It's a quality which (pardon me for comparing) popular fiction often just does not have. And this is just one example of the book's brilliance. It's use of motifs are strong, foreshadowing is used to great effect and it manages to have a twist-like twist as well. Another thing I loved was the Newspeak appendix at the end. It worked on so many levels. I haven't given much time to writing this review, and it may not come out too well, but everything here is totally honest. Read. This. Book."
670,Erika Torregroza,"He escuchado por ahí que los mejores libros son los que dicen lo que ya sabes de antemano. A mi me parece que los mejores libros son los que superan las expectativas de un conocimiento propiamente empírico. Por eso digo con toda seguridad que 1984 es uno de los mejores que he leído. Orwell nos proporciona con sus ideas futuriastas -que no se alejan de nuestro presente- una utopía. A el Estado sólo le interesa el poder absoluto, y lo consigue con una prefecta sociedad jeárquica, dominando en su totalidad al individuo, física y sobre todo psicológicamente. El hombre es privado de todos los derechos humanos, no existe libertad de exprecion, intelectual ni de pensamiento, las emociones y el placer están prohibidos, el amor y la amistad son lacra de esta sociedad mientras que el miedo y el odio son sus principales herramientas de dominación. Crea su propia lengua para así dejar atras la manera ""arcaica"" con la que se comunica el ser humano. En cada capítulo suceden cosas impactantes, es adictivo y una vez que se hayas iniciado no podrás parar. Es un libro que hace trizas -por momentos- la conciencia humana."
671,Maíra Carvalho,"It's a book great to read in all ages, specially when you're a teenager starting to questioning the world. It had a great impact on me, and since then I have read the books several times. There's an urgency in his concern, I believe, that serves to interpret and make sense of much of our current days."
672,Mark Valentine,"This reading was my third of this novel; I admire and respect it with each reading. This time, I read it as Eric Blair's Last Will and Testament: He was dying while he was writing this, and he knew it, but he continued on to finish this and give it to the world as his final narrative of the perils of totalitarianism. A funny thing happened to me when I was reading it. My wife and I needed to go to the Homeland Security Office and get fingerprinted--we were adopting internationally and this was a way for them to watch us in their fighting the war on terror. When we arrived for our appt., we had to pass through the tight security similar to what we all do to fly. There were more surveillance cameras in this new government building than you find at WalMart! The security agent, a rather ample lass, had me called out since I sent the red lights flashing. I had to empty my pockets while she got her wand out to search me. When I was emptying my pockets, I pulled out my copy of 1984.""That's a great book,"" she said.""I know. This is my third time through it and I love it,"" I said, spread eagle, watching her pass over me with her wand while the security cameras collected my profile.""Oh. I've never read. I've just heard it's good."" She seemed satisfied with that.I cleared finally and we proceeded. "
673,Maria in the 16th century,"I've read this book several times, first in Spanish and later on in English. It's haunted me every time, and it remains one of my favourite books ever. I love dystopian universes / worst-case scenario futures, and 1984 is THE dystopian book. It's a masterpiece, terrifying in its message, its warning. It presents a future in which people are watched, deprived of freedom, taught to think what they ""should"" think. I've always been fascinated by the tight hold on language, the destruction of words and works of literature that the protagonist is initially a partaker of. If the word disappears, no one will remember its meaning, thus the concept will be gone (and not dangerous for the system anymore). Another remarkable symbol is the chamber of horrors in which every rebel has to face their worst fears until their mind collapses and they yield to the will of the authorities. Overall, it's the tale of an impossible struggle, a fight that's lost from the beginning because the protagonist can never win. Freedom is dead, and ""Big Brother"" rules. After writing this review, I will probably go and read it again... "
674,Мартин Касабов,"Велика, вечна книга, която никога няма да се забрави и винаги ще бъде актуална! Джордж Оруел е Прометей!!!"
675,Aditi,"I haven't read a book that fascinates and terrifies me as much as 1984 does. Orwell's acute vision of the future - a totalitarian state controlling it's citizens with technology and doublethink, among other things - is astonishing and horrifying. To think that he wrote this in the 1940s, long before the internet and phone/tv cameras (and certainly long before the XBOX One - ""telescreen""), this is such an ambitious and daunting venture, I cannot believe it must have been easy to write it, nor to get people to accept it and believe in it.Orwell is a visionary, his prose is succinct and well written and his plot is captivating. 1984 spins a lot of questions and contains a lot of answers to them. It makes you think, it makes you relate it back to our ""real world"" and challenges a lot of norms in society. Winston, Julia and O'Brien's characters are particularly well done. Part three is haunting and sickening and morbidly fascinating. I think this is one of the very few books I have given 5 stars too. Definitely a must read for everyone!"
676,Travis Reno,"many of you are expecting use this space to decry the steps that our government has taken that have brought us ever nearer to the dystopia envisioned by Orwell. And I have to admit, that when I started this book, that was my intention. As I got into the content of the book however, it occurred to me that there is another lesson here for me, and perhaps for you as well. I read this book in high school, but I remember almost nothing about it. Not only do I not remember the story, but also, and more importantly, I don't remember anything about the lessons it has to offer. How is it that a young teen could be exposed to such an important work as this and yet take nothing of any significance from it?You might say, particularly if you are one of the professional educators that follow me, that this is simply a flaw in my character or a lack of commitment on my part in my High School days. I don't deny that there were things that attracted an undue level of my attention in those days, and if this were unique to me, you might in fact be able to make that case. It appears to me however that the situation is more endemic than that. There are several others that have I have spoken with that share the same or similar experiences.Perhaps you might also make the case that this was just a case of a single ineffective teacher. But again, I would suggest that a cursory review of the experience of others rules this out as a feasible explanation.I would suggest instead that this is a problem with the way we approach education as a whole. Perhaps there is no real value in ""exposing"" our youth to topics such as this in which they have no significant interest. Perhaps instead that our seeking out and encouraging the interests of our youth. Perhaps even stimulating interest in underlying principles and offering something like 1984 as supporting material.I'll leave it to those of you who know more about this topic to me to discuss the ramifications of these ideas. One thing is certain, there has to be a better way of bringing the world of ideas, not just facts into the education system."
677,Cin,Es genial y aterrador y ese final da escalofríos. Definitivamente es uno de los mejores libros que he leído en mi vida.
678,Ahmed Mokhtar,"1984 is a marvelous novel that definetly lives to its reputation. Its similarities with many details that we are witnessing at the moment is extremely shocking, and fir me raised the question: ""Did George Orwell forsee the future technology, or help inspire it?""The narrative takes you through a journey of hope that ends with a shocking revelation in the last words of the book.The concepts of oppression that were developed in the novel as well were very deep. A great example for this is the use of ""Newspeak"" and its development throughout the years to replace the English language; and through that deleting whole concepts by simply deleting the words used to express them.Overall, it is an eye opening book that needs to be read if you aspire to gain a new perspective if you hope to read between the lines in our day to day experiences."
679,Elizabeth Lymer,"A must-read book. It opened my eyes to many, many things."
680,Shero10,"نصحني صديق بقراءة هذه الرواية بعد مزرعة الحيوانات لنفس الكاتب جورج اورويل..واكتشفت أمرين..الأول هو أننا بالفعل على طريق 1984 جديدة..تبدو مختلفة ولكن تسير في نفس الطريق وربما لا تقل بشاعة.. والثاني أن هناك رابط خفي بين الروايتين.. المزرعة تشرح ""كيف"" يفسد النظام..و 1984 تشرح كيف يتوحش النظام لدرجة الجنون..تخيل اورويل العالم مقسما بين ثلاث قوى عظمى:أوقيانيا وأوراسيا وإيستاسيا.. تتصارع لا على أرض بل على أيد عاملة يتم تسخيرها لخدمة ماكينة الحرب من أجل السلام كما ينص شعار الحزب المهيمن على أوقيانيا..غريب أن القوى الثلاثة تطبق نفس الفكر الشمولي التي تصبح فيه الدولة نصف إله..والأغرب أن منها أوقيانيا التي تضم انجلترا وأمريكا وما يسمى بالعالم المتمدن..وهي دول عرفت الديمقراطية والرأسمالية من قرون..لكن سلسلة من الحروب والثورات قامت لتوصل حزب الأخ الأكبر إلى السلطة..عشاق سيطرة الدولة على كل شيء ستبهرهم دولة الحزب الأوحد..حتى لو حاولت الوصول إلى مرحلة إعلان الألوهية..تراقب مواطنيها بسعار بشاشات الرصد وغيرها وتطلع عليهم وتعرف نواياهم وتحاسبهم عليها (شرطة الفكر)..تحدد مستوى معيشة الأفراد وتجرهم للمزيد من العمل غير المجدي وغير المجزي.. وبالتفكير المزدوج الذي يتبناه الحزب يتم التنظير والتبرير.. دون أن يشغل أحد باله بالتفاصيل لأن الحزب أعدم قدرة مواطنيه على التفكير..اخترعت تلك الدولة شيطانا وعدوا مشتركا كي تجمع الناس حولها..ممثلا في جولدشتاين والذي جعلت الدولة من كراهيته طقسا أشبه بالعبادة.. دقيقتا كراهية هستيرية ومهرجان سنوي يعد استعراضا لمستوى الهستريا في أوقيانيا..ما لم أستطع استيعابه هو أن كل تلك السياسات كانت تستهدف أعضاء الحزب وخصوصا الحزب الخارجي (شبه الطبقة الوسطى) وليس عامة الشعب..ولم يكن ما قيل على لسان احدى الشخصيات على أن العامة يجب أن يكونوا أحرارا كالحيوانات كافيا للتوضيح..من قلب عملية قلب الحقيقة ظهر ونستون.. الملتزم كعضو حزب بالقواعد والقوانين..والمتمرد على الحزب والأخ الأكبر..يكره ذلك الأخير والحزب..ويشك في معتقداته ومبادئه الغريبة..ولديه مشاعر وأحاسيس عمل الحزب على وأدها.. عقل وقلب ورغبة في التغيير..جريمة كاملة في منطق الحزب..يلمح أورويل إلى وهم الاصلاح من الداخل..أوبرايان الذي دعم فكرة الثورة لدى ونستون لم يكن إلا شيطانا مريدا أشرف على تعذيبه بعد قبض شرطة الفكر عليه..وكانت مواجهتهما الأخيرة هي أمتع ما في الرواية..الخلاصة..القهر لا يقتل الاختلاف والرغبة في التغيير فحسب..بل يصنع عبدا للدولة لا مواطنا فيها..ويصنع وطنا أشبه بخط تجميع السيارات..ونستون في النهاية مواطن منبوذ ومعزول بسبب شرطة الفكر..مشاعره وأحاسيسه وغرائزه تجاه جوليا ماتت لديه ولديها..وتحول إلى مهووس بالأخ الأكبر في ختام الرواية..بغض النظر عن التنظير لشعارات الحزب كما يشرح أوبرايان أو كتاب جولدشتاين الوهمي..أوصلت الرواية الأهم لمؤلفها رسائل لنا وتركتنا للتفاصيل نتأمل فيها..رواية نقرأها ونعيشها يوميا..في بلد على طريق 1984 كبلدنا.. أو كما نسميه كمصريين ""سكة اللي يروح ما يرجعش""..عذرا للاطالة"
681,Laurie,"This is truly a classic. I wasn't sure I would enjoy reading it a second time but it is absolutely absorbing. The future that Orwell dreamed up with a totalitarian party reshaping everything that makes us human in order to gain and maintain absolute power is truly frightening. The details of this society are amazing, from the devolution of our language so that heretical thoughts against the party aren't even possible, to the destruction of human and family bonds, to the destruction of history and the past and all that humanity has accomplished. ""He who controls the past, controls the present. He who controls the present, controls the future."" I hate that the reader is left with no hope that Winston's world will ever get any better (in fact it will get much and much worse) but for it to feel truly authentic to get his point across Orwell couldn't have ended it any other way."
682,Nadi Ghaffari,کتاب درخشانی بود.دوسش داشتم اما اونقدر فضایی که توصیف کرده برام دهشت باره که ترجیح میدم دیگه نخونمش...:))
683,Mamdouh Abdullah,"ما يزال لدى الكثيرين منا اعتقاد راسخ بأن كل خيار، حتى الخيار السياسي، هو بين الخير والشر. وأنه إن كان شيء ما ضرورياً فهو أيضاً خير. أعتقد أننا يجب أن نتخلص من هذا الاعتقاد الذي ينتمي إلى الطفولة المبكرة. ففي السياسة لا يستطيع المرء أن يفعل أكثر من تقرير أي الشريّن أقل. وهناك بعض الحالات لا يستطيع المرء أن يتخلص منها إلا بالتصرف كالشيطان أو الممسوس. فالحرب مثلاً، قد تكون ضرورية، لكنها بالطبع ليست خيرة أو عاقلة. وحتى الانتخابات العامة ليست مشهداً مفرحاً أو مهذباً تماماً. فإن كان عليك أن تشارك في أمور كهذه – وأظن أن عليك أن تفعل، مالم تكن محصناً بالشيخوخة أو الغباء أو النفاق – فسيكون عليك أيضاً أن تُبقي جزء من نفسك غير منتهك. * من كتاب مقالات جورج أورويل / الجزء الرابع في غالبية الكتب الأدبية حتى لو كانت قصة حب هناك مجال للسياسة. هناك من كتب عن الثورة ومجد لها مثل مكسيم غوركي في رواية الأم، وهناك من هاجم الثوريين الذين يريدون القيام بإنقلاب شامل في الدولة عبر إراقة الدماء وحلل ذهنيتهم مثل دوستويفسكي في الشياطين، وهناك من رسم لوحة درامية هائلة للفرد في ثورة بدل أن تعلي من شأن الفرد وحريته واستقلاله قامت بقمعه وجعلته آلة حقيرة مثل الدكتور زيفاجو للشاعر ليونيد باسترناك. ولكن هؤلاء الكتّاب في الأخير يستطيعون الكتابة دون أن تكون السياسة ذات ركن أساسي يستند عليه البناء الروائي بأكمله. أستطيع تخيل هذا الشكل للبنية الروائية: روائي يكتب وفي ذهنه فكرة لا علاقة لها بالسياسة، ثم دون إرادة قوية منه يضع هذه الفكرة في قالب عام السياسة جزء منه. ولكن من هو الكاتب الذي كانت أعماله الأدبية سياسية في المقام الأول؟ لطالما أبدع الروس كما في الأعمال السابقة، ولكن أياً من هؤلاء لم يستطع أن يزيح الروائي الإنجليزي جورج أورويل عبر عمله الشهير 1984 والذي يُعتبر من الكلاسيكيات الأدبية السياسية.كتب جوروج أورويل في إحدى أشهر مقالاته لماذا أكتب: أكثر ما أردت أن أفعله خلال السنوات العشر الماضية هو تحويل الكتابة السياسية إلى فن. بالنظر إلى الوراء من خلال أعمالي أرى أنني دائماً حين لا يكون لدي هدف سياسي فإنني أكتب كتباً لا حياة فيها. توصل أورويل إلى حيث يرى نفسه كاتباً سياسياً. يقول عنه كاتب سيرة حياته برنارد كريك: لم يدع أنه فيلسوف سياسي ولا حتى مجادل سياسي, إنه كاتب. كاتب بشكل عام. كاتب روايات ومقالات وقصائد ومراجعات كتب لا حصر لها. وكلها كانت تنم عن وعي سياسي. وبهذا المعنى يعتبر أفضل كاتب سياسي باللغة الإنجليزية منذ جوناثان سويفت الذي تأثر به أورويل كثيراً.في غمرة هذه الثورات التي تعصف بالعالم العربي والتحركات المنادية بالإصلاح والقوة الهائلة لمواقع التواصل الاجتماعي والتي أصبحت ذات سلطة هائلة ومرعبة قررت إعادة قراءة رواية جورج أورويل 1984. في الصفحة الأخيرة قرأت تاريخ انتهائي من قراءتي الأولى لها 31/10/2007م. أربعة سنوات مرت على هذه القراءة. أربعة سنوات انقلبت فيها المفاهيم وأصبح للطبقة الفقيرة رأي وحراك وأحدثت دوياً تتابعه وسائل الإعلام، ومواطنوا الدول الأخرى يتعلقون بهذا الخبر ويتابعون بحماس وكأن الأمر هو جزء منهم.في عالم لا حرية فيه، في عالم لا تستطيع أن تتنفس فيه بكل حرية دون أن تتهم بمخالفة أوامر الدولة، في مثل هذا العالم يكتب ونستون سميث بطل رواية جورج أورويل بخط رفيع في ورقة مسجلاً التاريخ بأنه العام 1984، وبثورية غمرته للحظات يصرخ من داخله دون أن يصرح خشية أن تلتقط كاميرات المراقبة هذه الكلمات: ليسقط الأخ الأكبر .. ليسقط الأخ الأكبر. يكتب بسرعة رهيبة. ما يغمر شعوره في لحظات قد لا يأتي مرة أخرى: سيرمونني بالرصاص ولن أبالي .. سيطلقون عليّ النار من الخلف غير أني لا أبالي, وليسقط الأخ الكبير .. إنهم دائماً يطلقون النار عليك من الخلف، لكنني لن أبالي. وليسقط. سميث مواطن في دولة مختلقة هي أوشيانيا، يرتدي مع جميع سكان هذه البلدة زياً موحداً، في منازلهم آلة رصد ترصد تحركاتهم، الأطفال جواسيس على الآباء، الجيران جواسيس على الجيران الآخرين. أي موعد تعطيه لفرد آخر هي محاولة مدبرة من الذهن للقيام بتحركات غير مشروعة. يستيقظ سميث على وقع كلمات الأخ الكبير في آلة الرصد ثم يذهب إلى عمله في وزارة الحقيقة. هو لا يقوم بالحفاظ على الحقيقة، بل يقوم بتغيير الماضي لجعله يتوافق مع الحاضر. بمعنى إذا كانت توقعات الحزب مخالفة لما هي عليه في الوقت الآني، يتم تغيير التوقعات الماضية في السجلات بحيث تتطابق مع الواقع الحالي، أي أن الحزب الحاكم أو الأخ الأكبر هو بمثابة الإله: كل ما يقوم به، كل تحركاته، كل حركة وكل قرار يتخذه هو قرار حكيم وصائب وغيره خطأ. حتى لو قال الأخ الأكبر أن 2+2 = 5، فيجب أن تكون هذه هي النتيجة الصحيحة.أتذكر ذلك الشعور الذي غمرني لحظة قراءتها قبل أربع سنوات. في غمرة الصدمة قلت هذه الرواية بالغة الروعة. إنها تصف العقل المفكر للحزب أو للدولة ذات التوجه الرسمي الواحد. كيف يتصرف مع السكان وكيف يستحوذ على عقولهم إما برضا منهم أو رغماً عنهم. لم يكن إعجابي بسبب بنية الرواية بشكل كامل، بل بسبب الكتاب الثاني الذي زجه جورج أورويل في الرواية وهو كتاب غولدشتاين. وكتاب غولدشتاين هذا هو كتاب أهداه أحد ضباط الشرطة لسميث ليقرأه حتى يعرف الطريق للثورة وكيفية تحطيم الحزب الواحد وتغيير الواقع الذي يعيش فيه. ثم يكون هذا الكتاب السبب الرئيس في عودة عقل سميث المضطرب إلى أحضان الحزب ويتقبل كل ما يقوله الأخ الأكبر رغماً عنه ودون إرادة منه. والآن وبعد أن أعدت قراءة الرواية تساءلت: كيف تقبلت هذا الكم الهائل من التشاؤم قبل أربعة سنوات؟ إنها رواية تشاؤمية بامتياز. تحطم إيمان الفرد بالأمل، بالحب، بكل شيء جميل على هذه الأرض. هل كان أورويل مهتماً بزرع هذه الروح التشاؤمية الهائلة وأن ينشرها كعلامة على تحطيم الأمل وأية بذرة حقيقية في الحياة؟ لا أظن ذلك. كتابة الرواية كانت أشبه بالتحذير الذي قد تخلفه هذه الأنظمة في شعوبها. حيث يؤمن شعب هذه الدولة بأن نهاية التاريخ قد حلت. يستيقظ سميث ومن هم من أمثاله في دول العالم الواقعة تحت نظرة واحدة وفكرة واحدة بأن الماضي ابتداء من الأمس قد تم محيه بالكامل. وحتى إذا كان له وجود فقد يكون في أشياء قليلة مصمتة لا كلمات عليها. لا نعرف شيئاً محدداً عن الثورات والسنوات التي سبقتها، كل السجلات تم إتلافها أو تحريفها، وكل كتاب أعيد كتابته، وكل صورة أعيد رسمها، وكل تمثال وشارع وبناية جرى استبداله، وكل تاريخ جرى تحريفه، ومازالت تتواصل حتى يتحقق نهاية التاريخ. انتفت صفة الوجود عن كل شيء عدا الحاضر الذي لا نهاية له. المقارنة بين النظام الذي قام بخلقه جورج أورويل في روايته قد ينطبق بالتمام على النظام السوفييتي السابق والأنظمة الاشتراكية في أوروبا الشرقية في الثلاث العقود الأخيرة من القرن العشرين. سيكون مبالغاً فيه أن يتم وصف نفس هذا النظام الأورويلي بالأنظمة العربية ذات الرؤية الواحدة. الإدارة ليست هي نفسها. ولكن الفكرة: الفكرة الأورويلية موجودة في غالبية النظم الديكتاتورية في العالم قديماً وحديثاً. أي أنها تنطبق على الدول ذات الحكم الواحد بلا استثناء. إن مشاهد التحقيق والتعذيب الذي مر بها سميث هي نفسها سلطة القمع التي تصادر حرية الإعلام وتفرض وجهة نظر واحدة يجب أن يتقبلها. قد لا تكون وسيلة الإعلام هي الصحافة كما هو متعارف عليه. بل عملية ذهنية منظمة تنتقل إلى الفرد عبر التعليم والاقتصاد والنظم الاجتماعية وغيرها. يتم تكبيله من جميع الأطراف إلى أن يصل إلى حالة يتوحد فيها مع النظام دون إرادة منه. يفقد الأمل في التغيير. يفضل أن يعيش دون أن يتعرض له أحد، مهدداً إياه في أبناءه وحياته وسلامة جسده وعقله. هذه أول مرة أجد نفسي أهرب من الأفلام المقتبسة من أعمال أدبية. حاولت مشاهدة Nineteen Eighty-Four 1984 المقتبس من رواية أورويل هذه ولم أستطع أن أواصل المشاهدة، بسبب مشهد التحقيق وعملية تحطيم إرادة سميث وإعادة خلقه من جديد عبر شخصية أوبراين. يتم القبض على سميث ويقوم أوبراين بعملية تحطيم الفكرة التي تدور في ذهن سميث حول الدولة والثورة والأخ الأكبر. إن كان هناك من شك حول النظام العام يجب أن لا يتم تحطيمه فحسب، بل يجب أن يلغى من الذاكرة نهائياً. لا شيء حقيقي في هذا العالم سوى الأخ الأكبر والحقائق التي يقصف بها أوبراين عقل سميث. الحقيقة عند أوبراين ليست حقيقة بالمعنى المتعارف عليه، هي مجموعة من الأكاذيب التي يجب أن تكون حقيقة ثابتة، حتى لو وقفت العمليات الرياضية والفيزيائية ضد هذه الأكاذيب, يجب أن يتم تحطيم المنطق والعمليات الرياضية الأكيدة لتتناسب مع فكرة الأخ الأكبر. هذا المشهد الطويل والمرهق نفسياً هو شبيه بالمشهد الذي يقوم فيه الثائر V في فيلم V for Vendetta بزج إيفي في الحبس والقيام بتعذيبها والتحقيق معها بأسلوب قاسي. إلا أن الفكرة التي يسير عليها البطلين مختلفة كل الاختلاف. هناك من يزرع الخوف، وهناك من يحطم الخوف. سميث يخرج من الغرفة 101 ولم يعد يعرف من هو، هل له روح بالأصل: هل هو إنسان يسير على قدميه أم مجرد آلة تسيرها ماكينة الإعلام الضخمة لحزب الأخ الأكبر. بينما إيفي تخرج وهي تبسط ذراعيها وكأنها تحتضن القادم من نشيد V في الخامس من نوفمبر، إنسان جديد وروح جديدة وإرادة جديدة وُجدت لتعيش.أحد النقاد قال بعد قراءة الرواية : أورويل في عمله هذا ليس لديه أي أمل، لا يترك للقارئ أية ارتعاشة فتيل من الأمل. هنا دراسة في التشاؤمية لا تسمح بالارتياح أو الاستبدال إلا بفكرة أنه إذا كان الإنسان قادراً على تصور 1984، فإنه يستطيع أيضاً أن يتجنبه. أظن أن هذا الناقد تناسى الفصل السابع من الرواية، وتحديداً المقدمة ذات العشر أسطر. هذه السطور تمثل قمة الأمل، بل هي ما نراه الآن ويراه العالم على الشاشات, حين يقول سميث: إن كان هناك من أمل، فالأمل يكمن في عامة الشعب. من هذه الكتلة البشرية يمكن أن تنبعث القوة القادرة على تدمير الحزب. لا يمكن إسقاط الحزب من داخله. فأعداؤه، إن كان له أعداء أصلاً، لا يمكنهم أن يجمعوا صفوفهم أو حتى أن يتعارفوا. أمر الانتفاضة يعرف من نظرة في العيون أو نبرة في الصوت أو في الغالب بكلمة يُهمس بها من وقت لآخر. لذلك لو أمكن لعامة الشعب أن يدركوا مدى قوتهم لما كانت هناك حاجة للتآمر، فكل ما يحتاجه الأمر أن ينتفضوا مثلما ينتفض الحصان لإزاحة الذباب بعيداً عنه. ولو أرادوا لمزّقوا وأحالوا الحزب هشيماً تذروه الرياح بين عشية وضحاها، ولا بد أن يخطر لهم ذلك إن عاجلاً أو آجلاً .. !http://wp.me/p28q6M-56"
684,Nick Kinsella,"I finally got around to reading 1984. After reading, viewing, and playing countless other iterations of dystopian worlds, I thought that nothing in this book would be able to surprise me.Boy was I wrong."
685,Marwan Alamoudi,"الرواية كتبت عام 1949 والعام المذكور في العنوان 1984 هو تنبأ مستقبلي بأحداث الرواية في هذا العام و الرواية عبارة عن اسقطات سياسية عن الفكر الشيوعي في الاتحاد السوفيتي في ذاك الوقت و قرأت عن الرواية انها كانت من اكثر و اشهر الروايات المحظورة بالإتحاد السوفيتي. من اروع الروايات التي قرأتها اسلوب سلس و ابتكار رائع في احداث الرواية و تقنياتها, و أرى ان الرواية اسقاط ايضا للواقع الحالي في تعامل الحكومات مع الشعوب, و تطبيق التفكير المزدوج ومعناه أن تحمل فكرة ما وتحمل نقيضها بنفس الوقت وغيرها من الاسقاطات التي ستكتشفها في احداث الرواية.من لديه ميول سياسية نوعا ما ستبهره الرواية كثيرا وخاصة فكرة (التفكير المزدوج) التي تم استخدامها بعد انتشار الرواية في علم النفس و علم الإجتماع "
686,Eric Martindale,"I am forever indebted to George Orwell for influencing me through this book. If you haven't read it, you need to. It seems impossible that Orwell could have foreseen so many societal ills with the accuracy that he did, especially before many of the technologies that he wrote of scarcely existed during the time of his writing. Of course, much of this prophetic story was not fulfilled by 1984; some of it has still not come to fruition. However, Orwell shows us in this work that it is possible to look decades down the road and foresee with some clarity the fruits of our labors. "
687,Fiver,"This book is THE definitive dystopian work. The first time I ever heard about '1984' was in 5th grade. ""It's a story about a man who lives in a society that is entirely surrounded by cameras,"" said my teacher, ""until one day he finds one spot in his house where the cameras can't see him.""This was a simple enough explanation for a 13-year-old that I picked up the book a few years later. What I read changed my life.'1984' is a depiction of absolute totalitarianism. In the world of '1984', all public and private spaces are continually monitored by cameras. 3% of the population forms The Party... the one true government which rules over any and all aspects of life. They monitor and watch another 13% of the population... the middle class, who are kept in poverty via an eternal war. The government, symbolized by 'Big Brother', tells you what to eat, when to exercise, who to marry, where to work... but it does not stop there. The government also decides what is history and what is not. It decides which words exist and which ones are not to be used. Most frightening of all, the government specializes in detecting and punishing 'Thoughtcrime'... the abominable act of thinking thoughts that do not agree with the State.Into this world is set a man named Winston Smith, who begins to do the unthinkable and imagine that the State is not, in fact, all-powerful.Everyone needs to read this book. It addresses the worst aspects of the conflict between man and state, but digs deeper than that as well, questioning the very concept of authority and free will. Can mere authority change reality itself? Is it true that the human spirit can never be conquered? This is the book that made me ask these questions. Read it."
688,Haya Anis,"Great book. I absolutely loved it. I think my ninth grade English teacher once said that if a book is really good, you'll still have hope the inevitable won't happen. To the last minute, I hoped Winston would not get caught and when he did, it was the most unexpected thing. Almost scary, even. Would 100% recommend it to everybody. "
689,Suzanne,Timeless and amazing!!!
690,Kevin,"Orwell depicts a vivid portrayal of the ills of a totalitarian regime – even the consequences of government overreach in general. His society is the most extreme one imaginable created by a government with absolute power. While painting his picture of a dystopian world, Orwell links us into Winston Smith, the main character, an everyman who the reader is able to identify with. He is someone like us – an outsider in this totalitarian world, who is unable to completely submit his mind and will to Big Brother (the State). We are able to experience the absolute control of the government through Winston’s eyes – its physical and psychological control of its subjects, to Winston’s expanding discontent, his rebellious acts and finally their destined consequences.Under this veil, Orwell demonstrates how weak and frail a totalitarian regime truly is. In order to control its subjects, Big Brother has to have absolute control of information – to even alter the past, to constantly control minds through propaganda, to create constant war to keep the society poor, and to use fear mongering (i.e. encouraging kids to rat out their parents to the thought police) to force its will on the people. It even uses language as mind control – whittling language away to limit thoughts and expressions. Ultimately, Big Brother is only able to force Winston to submit by torturing and brainwashing him into an empty shell like the rest of its subjects.This book is great for the high school reader and beyond – it is an easy read while allowing the reader to consider the implications of living in such a society. Its endurance is also impressive – this book was originally published in 1949 – the same work could be published today and be just as relevant."
691,Tatiana,"Orwell was genius in inventing the principle of ""doublethink"". Even the reader has to learn to doublethink in order to fully understand the book. There is hope, but at the same time the absence of hope. He shows the power of the individual as well as the weakness of the individual in front of the mass. In addition, ""1984"" has the power to scare, it is inevitably an actual book and it will always be. It is out of the ordinary because it threatens the reader through their future rather than the past, and, more important, Orwell shows the importance of the present, by making clear that it is not repeatable. "
692,Sarah (Presto agitato),"(This review refers to the Italian translation)Operating on the principle that l'ignoranza non è forza, I wanted to read some books in Italian before taking a trip to Italy in a few months. My Italian is rusty, to put it mildly. 1984 may seem like a strange choice of Italian reading material (view spoiler)[unless maybe it's for a Celebrity Death Match? (hide spoiler)], but I found an ebook version of it and figured since I’ve read it a gazillion times, it wouldn’t matter too much if I occasionally got lost. The syntax is straightforward, which helps (believe me, I am not ready for Umberto Eco). My husband thought I was a little crazy to read this, but wait until we get to Italy and he wants to order a glass of Victory Gin. Who’s going to have the last laugh then?I found the translation feature on the Kindle to be very useful for reading in a second language. You can load a translation dictionary so that when you touch a word in the book you're reading, you get its translation. If a translation isn’t available, it defaults to a standard dictionary in the book’s language. Sometimes that’s even preferable, since it doesn’t take your mind out of the language you're working in. I found that on average I probably looked up about as many words per page as I did for Ulysses, which is, ostensibly, in English. As far as the quality of the translation goes, I don’t think my Italian is good enough to be too critical. I thought Manferlotti did a good job with Newspeak, especially with the fictional appendix at the end. It’s a tricky thing to convey the sense of Newspeak in a language other than English, but it worked well.One quibble - I thought the use of the word topo for “rat” was strange, especially given its importance to the story. That word makes me think of Mickey Mouse (“Topolino”), like in these comic books similar to those I remember at my grandparents' house years ago:

The word ratto seems a lot closer to 1984’s not-so-benign rodent, which I picture more like this charming guy:

693,Amy Arsenault,"This was my third attempt at reading this book if I remember correctly, and though I finished it took me quite a long time to do so. A couple months I believe. I kept getting bored and forgetting about it for a few days and then finding it, and forcing my way through more, knowing that this was one book I promised myself I HAD to finish whether I wanted to or not. I'd say it was about the half way point to the beginning of the last quarter of it that I had trouble with. I just have three things to say. 1) Oh man, am I glad I made myself finish this book. 2) I was not expecting it to wind up being so shocking, horrifying, powerful, and burned into my memory (I tend to forget books and movies for them most part about a month after I finish them even if I really enjoyed them... which is why I stopped attempting to study history finally). 3) (WHAT COULD BE CONSIDERED A VAGUE SPOILER COMING UP NEXT) I literally felt sick to my stomach and finished the last quarter with my eyes wide open in horror and shock and was slightly traumatized for weeks after. Not over the graphic detail so much (I mean, a bit of course but that was not the point of my shock and horror), but just the powerful concept and story to it all that came together at the end in a way I was not expecting. I don't know if I should have been expecting that ending, but I wasn't and it shocked me and you know art is good when it is powerful enough to shock and traumatize, if that's the direction it was supposed to be going in.. It left me thinking deeply and worrying deeply and understanding finally what all the fuss is about and I am so very glad I read this and will read it again."

695,M.," Orwell's masterpiece to me, though Animal Farm is of course up there. So spare and lean without an ounce of fat on its bones, yet resonant beyond its short length. This book is ""Important"" which stops a lot of people from realizing it would otherwise be a nice, spooky Sci Fi tale. Beyond genre, and beyond apropos for any time and place."
696,Radia Fodil,"Orwell , such a brilliant visionnary , created this timeless masterpiece , for us to think about our world ,and our values , what is truth? What's real and what's illusion? Can we really be free ?how far would you go to be free ? At what cost comes peace ? , its a book that everyone should read"
697,Claudia Mendes,"“Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.”“The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you already know.”""What can you do, thought Winston, against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?"""
698,Silvana,"WAR IS PEACE.FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.Those words keep sounding in my head since I read this book. Gosh, probably the most haunting not to mention frightening book I've ever read. 1984 should also be included in the horror genre.1984 describes a Utopia. Not Thomas More's version of Utopia, but this is one is the antithesis, i.e. Dystopia. Imagine living in a country, whose leaders apply a totalitarian system in regulating their citizen, in the most extreme ways, which make Hitler, Mao, Stalin and that old bloke in V for Vendetta look like sissies.Working, eating, drinking, sleeping, talking, thinking, procreating...in short living, all are controlled by the state. Any hint of obedience or dislike can be detected by various state apparatus such as the Thought Police, telescreen, or even your children, who will not hesitate to betray you to the authorities. Even language is modified in such ways that you cannot express yourself, since individualism is a crime.The past is controlled, rewritten into something that will strengthen the incumbent ruler. Who controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present, controls the past. There is no real truth. The ""truth"" is what the state says it is. Black is white, 2+2=5, if the state says so.The world in 1984 is divided into three states, originated from the ashes from World War II: Oceania (British Isles, the Americas, Pacific, Australia), Eurasia (Europe & Russia), and Eastasia (the rest of it). Continuous warfare between those three (who hold similar ideologies) is required to keep the society's order and peace. Si vis pacem para bellum. That's describes the first slogan.The second slogan, freedom is slavery, means the only way to be free is by letting you lose yourself and to be integrated within the Party. That way, you'll be indestructible and immortal.Ignorance is strength, means the division on high, middle, low classes in society will never be changed. The middle wants to be the high and they'll act ""on behalf of the low"" to dethrone the high. Afterwards, a new middle class arises, all will change except the low. The high and middle make and uphold the law, the low (proletarian) is just too stupid to revolt. The state maintains its structure by torture, intimidation, violence, and brainwashing.Blimey, Orwell's Animal Farm is already depressing, but 1984 gives ""depression"" a new meaning, at least for me."
699,Jane,"I first read this, as many do, in high school. Now, after 40 some years, I have come back and re-read it. I'm not sure how I got through it in high school! It's a wonderful dystopian novel, but it does bog down in parts. And the last 1/3 of the book is intense and terrifying and depressing. I was left sad and wrung out when I finished it.My only issue is Orwell's dismissive attitude to the masses - the ""proles"". These are the salt of the earth people - the people who produce the food and make the clothes and furniture and necessities of life. He treats them as though they are unworthy of being mentioned or thought of - they are stupid animals. I know it's fiction, but somehow I think he truly looked down on the poor and uneducated. I also was bothered by the lack of religion - after only 40 years, there would still be pockets of true believers. Not everyone is a believer, but those few that are true believers would not give up their faith in God and in a better (after)life so easily."
700,Teens Berwyn Public Library,"Winston Smith is an average man living an average life… Other than the fact that he’s living in a dystopian society in which “Big Brother” is always watching. Winston has frequent rebellious thoughts about the totalitarian government, which he writes about in his journal, in a nook in his apartment so that the telescreen can’t see him. Other things exist in this society to oppress and control its citizens, such as the fact that if you think rebellious things, the Thought Police will catch you and execute you. In a society controlled by the government, will Winston be able to join the revolutionary Brotherhood group with his lover Julia, or will he succumb to the ideals of the leaders of the society?In this classic novel by George Orwell, the utter concept of the book will have you turning page after page. It’s twisted, creepy, and fascinating in every way.Reviewed by: Emily B."
701,Jana,"I really, really enjoyed this book. It was so well-written and I thought the story was really exciting. I especially loved the ending, even though that might be a weird thing to say."
702,Red,"Well. This book.Actually, I kinda confused to give how much stars to this book. Around 4.5, but let's--exactly enough--5 stars.I confused about this novel. Sometimes I just wanna put it down, read another novel--maybe YA, no, always YA, actually. But I tell my self to, like, ""just give it a try"". I did finished Animal Farm, even I have to forced myself to read it 'cause task for college, but eventually, I enjoyed it. And it did the same with this book. After the story started to the conflict, it can't make me put it down.--------The thirty nine Winston Smith is one of employee of Departemen Catatan (Record Department?) and also member of Partai Luar (Outside Party?). In his country, Oceania, the holder of power fall to the Partai (Party), which is, as outline, divided into Partai Inti (Core Party?), Partai Luar (Outside Party?), and Proletariat. Winston always make 'good' expression, 'good' body language, and really careful about what his thoughts.But, for the last, he not really successful to eliminate that. Always, in his subconscious, he always can remember what Partai (Party?) told them it's wasn't happen. He antipathy to Partai (Party) and Big Brother--and Polisi Pikiran (Mind Police?)Conflict really happen, when piece of paper stuck to his hand when he helping a girl with black hair from Fiction Department.It turns out, not only he, who felt that way.Exceedingly, when Persaudaraan (Brothers?) became 'real' in his life.---------If I can compare it--just the politics--with The Hunger Games; Hunger Games became the fiction, and 1984 became the real life.Kinda similar, I thought.And this is more scarier than HG, if it's in true real life.Well, let's hope in 2050, Orwell wrong. Minimal, about the Newspeak. No, about everything.A."

706,Kristi Cramer,"What a compelling read. Or I should say listen, since I did the audiobook. Where do I start? I'm still processing, I think. In some ways I wish I had read it since I don't feel like I really grasped some of the concepts like doublespeak right away. But by the end I think I got it. It just astounds me how prophetic so many things seem to be, especially when I'm at my most cynical. The differences between why young Julia breaks the rules vs. why Winston is breaking them, for instance. Big Brother could be the NSA, or heck, even Facebook. The reason for the ""war"", good God that rings true. When I look at the divide between classes in America, and the suppression of the lower classes, and being a struggling middle class member myself.... Not to mention the mind games the media plays. It all rings a warning bell. Oh yes, there is a lot to process on this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who has a desire to think about society and the way things can go horribly wrong. The damage that can be done by just going along with the status quo. In some ways 1984 is an outrageous exaggeration, but then when one looks at where we are today, the things that haven't come true are far more plausible given the things that HAVE come true--not precisely, but thematically. This is not a happy book. There isn't much action and it does not end with a happy ever after. It is thought provoking, and if you have nightmares after reading it, as I have, all the better."
707,Ana Luković,"Crappy translation and numerous typos aside, I loved this book. There was something so powerful and unremitting about it, like a quiet, but ever present force. I could not put it down.Orwell’s nightmarish vision of the future (or, is it the past?) kept me up and alert for hours. I barely slept or ate. Things like feeding my cat didn’t seem so important anymore. How could they be when I feel like we’ve narrowly escaped this bleak, horrible world described in the novel? A few maniacal propositions here, a bit of fire there, a few wrong choices, mix it well and add a dash of lunacy and there you have it – “the perfect world.”I’m not exactly sure which frightens and shocks me the most – a world where literature is being rewritten and simplified, a world where language is being altered in horrible ways or a world where history is being rewritten and, in some cases, even completely destroyed, to the point of being rendered as non-existent. Good or bad, history is history. It should not be touched, only learned from.This domineering, totalitarian society reminds us of many past and present ones. However, the people in charge of it have taken their reign to a whole new level. Eliminating basic human emotions, suppressing natural human impulses, suffocating free will and exterminating all and any bonds of friendship and love among people. Turning children against parents, propagating hatred and violence and controlling all aspects of one’s life, to the point where one has to discipline gestures, face movements and even thoughts. Reality is no longer what it is, but what they tell you it is. A chill ran down my spine just writing that sentence.This is the bleak, depressing world the protagonist introduces us to. His greatest crime is buying a diary, a way of emitting his thoughts and ideas without constant vigilance and fear of being discovered and charged with ‘thoughtcrime’. He is not sure himself why he has gone to all the trouble of buying a diary and keeping one. In time, he comes to realise that this life he and millions of others are living is not how it should be lived. He wants to educate younger generations the way older generations failed to educate and help him. A natural rebellion of the mind that quickly shifts into a rebellion of the body once he meets Julia. I loved the early scenes between them. I loved that they cursed and drank and ate the forbidden fruit. I loved that their love making was a political act of rebellion. I loved that they turned out not to be so similar after all. Variety is the spice of life. It can never truly be extinguished. People can never truly shut down their emotions and turn into robots. The human mind and the human spirit will always find a way to re-emerge, even if one was taught to block humanity from the very beginning.At least, that’s what I strongly believed. And then I read the novel in its entirety and my jaw hit the floor. They got to him! In the end, they managed to break him and brainwash him and plant their own babies in there. I never, not even for one second, thought that it would happen. There wasn’t even a possibility that allowed that in my mind. And yet they broke him. How? Isn’t the human mind and spirit supposed to be impenetrable? ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones, but regardless of what you do, you’ll never be able to change my mind’, or something like that? But, I guess I was wrong. Nothing’s impenetrable, not even the mind.In the end, we have a broken person. He is no longer the inquisitive, feisty rebel, he can no longer love, just thinking about certain things aches him. He has become a hollow shell, a mere shadow of his former self. He loves Big Brother. For the first time, he loves him for real."

711,Alona,"It's funny when you know you've read a book, can remember a few details, but have little or no memory of the book or when you read it. That's how 1984 was for me. I know I read it in either high school or college and it wasn't assigned reading. From the book, my main memory was actually from the final scene between Winston and Julia even though I could barely remember their love affair.I don't know what my reactions were the first time reading this book, but this time I was amazed and saddened by the loss of freedom. It was one thing that the Party controls every aspect of their lives, but that they insist on controlling their every thought and emotion. I just can't imagine that freedom being taken away from me and it broke my heart to see how they broke Winston down until he did not even have one iota of himself left. It's a terrifying, but incredibly intelligent and beautiful book that everyone should read it."
712,Krishna Kumar,"“1984” is the classical dystopian novel by George Orwell. It portrays a world where government sees and controls everything. A planet with never-ending war that is meant less for conquest than to channel the energies of the population away from the repressive powers that control them. A hell where even the wrong expression on your face can send you to prison, torture and death. A place where the truth of the past is systematically eradicated and revised and where even the people who remember historical events are confused as to whether their memory is correct. And where you can trust no one, not even your children who have been trained to reveal you to the authorities if they detect the slightest trend towards dissent.Orwell started the novel at a time when the Nazi threat was receding and being replaced by totalitarian Communism. The Communist threat seemed to grow more bigger during the writing of the novel. Not only had almost all of Eastern Europe fell under the Communist yoke, but also even in the democratic West, there was a lot of sympathy for Communist ideas and parties that openly supported socialist ideas, especially nationalization of key industries. Clearly, Orwell imagined a slippery slope situation where the Anglophile countries would undergo a Communist makeover and become just as oppressive and controlling as the countries behind the Iron Curtain.If the novel seems a little over the top, two things should be remembered. One is that Orwell was imagining a worst-case scenario where government not only wants to destroy rebellion, but also force rebels to disown their ideas. Second is that many things mentioned in the book actually happened and still happen, albeit not at the same scale and not always together. Orwell’s worries were about a socialist dictatorship and in the second part of the twentieth century, we saw the horrible disasters in the Soviet bloc and China that resulted in millions dead and displaced. Today, on a smaller scale, they happen in North Korea. At the same time, we also get to see religious fundamentalist regimes do similar things in Iran and Afghanistan. In all these cases, war (or cold war), torture, gulags, censorship, surveillance and other instruments of government power have been used to promote the ideology of those in power and to suppress any rebellious voices.Notice I have not yet said a word about the plot. The reason is that the story is almost boringly simple. A man wonders if he can fight the government and then the government shows him the answer. “Nineteen Eighty-Four” is a book containing a very elaborate description of the future world and which uses the character of Winston Smith to bring it all together in a cohesive narrative. It is interesting that the entire novel is completely written from Smith’s point of view, but still uses the third person. Part of me wonders if it was not originally written in the first person and then changed so that the ending is not predictable.The good thing is that Orwell’s predictions did not come true. Communism as the driver of government policy has been dismantled in most countries. More countries have been moving towards democracy. And while there have been setbacks in the form of various wars and conflicts (particularly the Middle East and Africa), humanity has seen enormous progress in reducing poverty and disease. It could all change, of course. After all, human nature still remain the same. But there is good reason for optimism and to cheer that we are not living in the world of 1984."
713,Meaghan Steeves,"This book was completely insane. It is the dystopic book to end all dystopic books without a single doubt! It is certainly up there among the most depressing books I've ever read but the writing and the story structure was nothing short of brilliant. It is absolutely terrifying and makes me very grateful that I don't live under a totalitarian government. This is a world where sex is a political act, your thoughts are controlled, you live in a twenty-four hour clock and the true history is eliminated. I'm SO glad I finally picked this classic up!"
714,Emma,"Firstly, the psychological manipulation and the lack of humanity of the people in this was terrifying.Other than that, it was really good - I see why it's a favourite for English students. There are so so many themes to be analysed, so many symbols - for example, the symbol of big brother; a family protector. But in that 1984 world, families are not families in the traditional sense, so what would a 'big brother' mean? Another similie I liked was one comparing a helicopter or something like that to a bluebottle - what a helpful way to envisage the story! But it was scary how the society; the existence of human beings had almost become obselete. There was no need to live, no real purpose in their lives apart from just existing, working, and hating the ever changing enemies of Oceania. Even the language was being whittled down, so all the many hundreds of lovely adjectives and words, with slight variants of meaning were being reduced to nothing, so reducing the ways of expression of the children and people in that society - although could it really be called a society?This is a little spoiler. In these kinds of books - the hunger games, with Katniss Everdeen being the one that springs to mind, the people revolt against the government, and there's a revolution; the people win. But with this, you're prevented from ever thinking to, and if you do, what's the use of the actions of one person against the Party? Isn't that - the fact that you cannot do anything to escape or change your situation such a horrible thought?To conclude this short short review (I'll probably reedit this at a later date) I'd really really recommend this book as a must-read. "
715,Nurtan Meral,"Çok etkilendim, 5 yıl önce okusam fantezi derdim ama hem burada hem dünyada olanlar ; belki de bendeki değişim, anlamlandırmamı değiştirdi. Korkunç bir kehanetin çoğunun gerçekleştiğini sanıyorum. Umarım yıllar sonra tekrar okur ve o zaman çok karamsarmışım derim. "
716,Dario,"I loved this portrait of a negative late-twentieth-century utopia by George Orwell. 1984 is the story of Winston Smith, an ""outer party"" member who dislikes the Party, but tries to hide it. The Party is the controller of the section of the world he lives in, where they created an atmosphere of doublethink that harmonizes clear opposites. Thus, the Party's main slogans are ""war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength"". The Party's figure/symbol is Big Brother, the looming dark-mustached figure who sees all from behind the telescreen. And because there is nothing Big Brother can't see, the outer party members (like Winston) lead fearful and scrutinized lives. When the Party finds its enemies from within the party members, it takes no mercy. It tortures them until they confess everything that has ever happened in their life, converts them into loving the Party and Big Brother, and eventually kills them. I thought that this book was George Orwell's way of warning the people of the 1950s of what could befall on humans if they follow a socialist-like path that leaves them all to be humans without individuality and imagination who only live to serve the government like the Party. One of the most scary parts was that even the kids were brainwashed in their little groups formed by the government called Spies, and they are even told to turn over their own parents for any type of thought-crime. What was most interesting from this book is that there was a third class other than the inner party and outer party members; the proles. The proles were the masses that the Party propagated to believe in things that they (basically) made up. What is interesting about this group is that they are 85% of the population and are therefore the only people who can overthrow the Party and create a new government, as Winston wrote in his diary.I would hate to live in this world."
717,Mukul,"My journey to the dystopian world just began. “1984” is happened to be not only one of the best works of George Orwell; it is regarded as one of the 100 best English Novels of 20th century. Nineteen Eighty Four is a treat for lovers of hatred, torment, torture. This is the first time I have ever had a taste of dystopian Novel. I considered myself lucky as I started with one of the finest types of it. This Novel presented the sheer picture of totalitarian society where the slightest idea of “Individualism” was absent and this was an unknown word to all. Instead of that, the “oligarchic collectivism” is the ultimate purpose of the society. The past had been altered and controlled according to the need of the ruling party. The individual memory is a matter of trifle. The freedom of speech was being shattered every second. Every individual was stalked by the thought police every single moment. The ruling party was controlled by a big man; they called him “Big Brother”. His party was continuously injecting the idea of peace, slavery and strength into the blood of people in his own maneuvered way. The ruler was the ultimate source of power and everybody had to love them. Anybody ever went against them had to be disappeared or vaporized. There was no opposition against the ruling party. The story of this book is brilliantly constructed and told. The Protagonist of this book named “Winston Smith” kicked against the pricks. But, in doing so, he had to undergo path of dreadful anguish which I believe no one could put up with. Luckily, he was not vaporized. But, it was all right, everything was all right. He hated the party and its’ foreman with abhorrence of the last extreme. The hatred against Winston Smith is not against him merely rather it was against those who would ever try to go against the tide. But, he couldn’t victory over them and had to obey them till the final day of his death.The most discerning pick of 1984 is the “Power” for which everyone was craving for and became voracious for. This craving for eternal power led to the founding of utter “Totalitarianism” in Oceania. The only longing thing is the “Power”. Everything was being done for the retention of it. Here, the writer showed that the tyranny had been in the place for controlling everything which included human mind as well. This appealing Novel, written almost in lucid English, has the capacity of overwhelming someone with utterance negativity leaving no hope whatsoever. The writer manifested that the power should have been held with mass people. He presented all the possible solutions towards freedom, peace and strength yet ended the Novel with victory of evil over good. This pessimistic end of Novel with pessimistic thoughts of world once again will put anyone in the circle of never-ending dystopia. In case of a Novel, there is always a protagonist and the writer always puts his or her protagonist in the scene for describing things from the standpoint of a person. Anything is not worth describing if it is not from the standpoint of a single person. This option of choosing an individual is capitalized for understanding and presenting the entireness of the society through the eye of an individual. George Orwell has proved himself as a maestro by capturing the horrific scenario of “Totalitarianism” through the eye of a mere common man. Mr. Orwell's analysis of the lust for power is one of the less satisfactory contributions to our enlightenment, and he also leaves us in doubt as to how much he means by poor Smith's ""faith"" in the people (or ""proles""). Smith is rather let down by the 1984 Common Man, and yet there is some hint that common humanity remains to be extinguished.This dystopian Novel is one of the best works in its genre by any means and is a must read for people who adore this category. After reading this Novel, I wanted to go back to many of his other iconic writings and already put them in “to read list”. I rejoiced in George Orwell's graceful and heart-warming writings. Let’s call it a day with a smile of utopian."

719,Lina Saeed,"“Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know what no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me.” إنها رواية تقرأ ثم تقرأ من جديد"
720,Brian McLaughlin,"one of greatest English language novels, important in so many ways: for defying genre as book/art/manifesto/politik, etc.; for functioning as a work of art in the social-political spheres of the real world (truly impressive feat unmatched by any novel since (I say this without thinking--i awarded this distinction arbitrarily simply because I can) ). Although the novel has so many IDEAS, the writing style and the dialogue and plot, etc. are not undermined or made irrelevant because the ideations occur at the level of the character--Winston--and at the level of the sentence/overall plot. Characterization and action occur alongside Orwell's ideological intentions and expressions. an undefinable work of art that bridges the gap between literature and reality and between art and life. the book has too many dimensions and my entire understanding of what it is and what it represents are found only on the periphery of my consciousness, elusive to my grasping it so directly in order to transcribe it here.

721,Agv,"This gets the 5 stars because it has no major flaws, yet I reckon it could be much better than it is. I consider it totally worth the time, except a couple of moments when the author gets carried away writing theory.I read this book as a way to organize my own ideas and try another point of view, obviously you can't take all written here as truth but pretty much as an exaggerate truthWhat I learned with it:(view spoiler)[-You can change the past eventually (pragmatically) changing the records of the past-To change the past can change the present and the future-The ultimate torture is to control the thoughts -Instead of doing a war or having a scapegoat to control the masses just emulate them: even easier to control the situation-Let the smart join in and step on the stupid makes it easier-The government type really doesn't matter, all humanity has always been in a similar pyramid-The only way to have a equal society is to live all in the same step of the pyramid, which should have to be done by the lowest and wider step-To change the pyramid power is needed, so the situation is bound to be stable (hide spoiler)]If I had to describe this book with an image it would be for the quote If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face — forever"
722,David,"1984 by George Orwell is an amazing piece of artwork. The sheer power it holds behind it showing how much we rely on privacy and security in our everyday life’s if a tale of it's own. Within recent years the book has been brought back into light with all the NSA and privacy on the internet talk. In 1984 you follow Winston who from the gecko is all ready feeling oppressed and denied liberty. In Winston's world free thought and self expressionism is not allowed and is prohibited by Big Brother. No matter how hard Winston tried to get away from the party he couldn't succeed with party spies, thought police, telescreens, and community policing. This was one of the most influential books on me. In this Orwellian totalitarian world that Orwell described thought isn't a free concept that just anyone can have your everyday people are limited by what they can choose to believe in and talk about due to the mass surveillance and thought police. Without these basic liberty's and human rights that we are given people won't continue to thrive and want to develop new ideas. Well the major concept often taken away from this book is that over surveillance is bad and people need freedom we still can take a lot from this. The main points that 1984 brings so us in the modern era is that security is a timeless matter it doesn't matter if you are fighting against an oppressive government or if you are trying to stop backdoor s into encryption. Orwell showed us that in governments were people no longer feel safe they are willing to linger to another person who feels the same way that they do. Often times this will be used against them like it was with Winston. 1984 by George Orwell remains one of the books that I can reply to someone with 100% confidence that it had the biggest effect on me not only as a person but as a member of society. "
723,Amanda,"Orwell has written such a thought-provoking book that kept me thinking long after I read the last page. I marvel at how he was able to get inside my head and change the way I saw things. While I was reading 1984, every question had an automatic answer: ""because the Party and Big Brother wants it that way"". It was amazing how quickly Orwell took over my thoughts. Every word, every number, every detail was placed in precisely the way he wanted to give us as readers the feeling he wanted. It's crazy to think about the parallels to this dystopia that exist in the world today. Telescreens and security, vaporization and genocide, Newspeak and language - to name a few. This book made me angry, and it made me sad, but most of all, 1984 made me think. It made me think of the relationships we have with other people and the trust involved. It made me think about love and the fact that every human being deserves it. It made me think about truth and lies, and how to stand up for what I believe in. Orwell is such a great author to have put all those messages for me in one relatively short book. The paradoxes in the Party slogans made me think even more. In the beginning of the book, I just got angry at how the Party thought they could take away basic rights so easily. But as the book went on, I realized how these slogans could be true. I may not have liked them, but they DO make sense in a twisted sort of way. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It's a classic, and now I understand how it has become relevant to every period in time. Every day there are new connections you could make between the world and Orwell's imaginary world of Oceania. All people can learn from this book, and I definitely did. It made me rethink my life and why I did things. Did I do this because wanted to, or because society told me I should? I will now carefully examine every action I take before I go through with it. 1984 changed the way I think, and its influence will never go away."

727,Dean,"You can test people when discussing this novel. Just ask them what it is actually all about. Do not hint at them about looking for an answer, just ask them, ""What is Nineteen Eighty-Four about?"", and let them talk.People I would not want to talk to will tell us it is all about how every action we make is watched and monitored and how we are nailed the second we step out of line. And for certain, this does happen in the novel. In fact, it can be rightly argued that as Winston goes further and further out of line, the powers that be just keep watching him and waiting for the right moment to really put the boot in. But if one carefully analyses the work, one notices something very, very interesting.Surveillance is only a minor detail in the world Orwell creates.That probably surprises a lot of people unfamiliar with the work, but when one realises this critical point, one is deserving of congratulations, a pat on the back. Because now they are ready to really start reading Nineteen Eighty-Four.One of Winston's early adventures in the story concerns itself with his attempts to mingle amongst the ""proles"" and ask older proles about what life was really like before Ingsoc and Oceania. Were people really as miserable as Ingsoc propaganda proclaims? Did people really live in universal poverty whilst ""capitalists"" stepped on their heads? This question of comparison between this society that tells him ""we are better than the old way and you better believe it or else"" and the old, forgotten society that Winston is so desperate to find confirmation about is the first of many clues to what Orwell was really talking about.Winston has a small handful of people he talks to at his day to day work. Probably the most important of them is a man who works on the parameters of what English will eventually be replaced with. English is renamed Oldspeak in what is called Newspeak, the language that the Party intends to replace it with. Newspeak is deliberately designed to not only be possible for the speaker to speak without any emotional or thought-level connection to the words coming out of their mouths, but also to limit the parameters of thought itself.That, ladies and gentlemen, is what Nineteen Eighty-Four was really about.Consider if you will the word ""Ingsoc"", the ideology that the Party is driven by. In Oldspeak it would be rendered ""English Socialism"", and all of the attendant questions would be stimulated by the sound of the words. What is England? What is Socialism? And so on. These questions, when answered, would prompt further questions, and on it goes until thoughts that are not merely contrary to the ideology of Ingsoc occur. Some of the thoughts that these words can stimulate would prompt a desire on the part of those thinking them to destroy, tear down Ingsoc. So Ingsoc's Party helpfully creates a word for us that bypasses any emotional or intellectual stimulus, and helpfully tells us that we had better start learning to use this word and nothing else, or else we might disappear, completely.Remind you of anybody?Winston's day job is to change records of past events to reflect whatever reality the Inner Party wants to be current. If Oceania is at war with Eurasia and allies with Eastasia, then every newspaper, historical record, and file must reflect this. Even if it means that Winston and every hapless coworker he has in this job must rewrite the same record multiple times over to reflect this new reality. He even receives communications during the course of his work about old revisions he made. His old article is scolded by the bosses as ""refs unpersons"" and ""doubleplusungood"" and so forth. The narrative even explains to us that without Newspeak, the messages would inform him that his old work is ""highly unsatisfactory"" and ""makes references to non-existent persons"". I am uncertain of whether Orwell intended for his work to reference this fact or if it were just a (un)happy coincidence, but Humanity is literally overflowing with idiots who would not notice that he is referencing the mechanic of how one truly controls people. It is not sufficient to just put people in chains and give them orders. No, you have to physically and psychologically reinforce that the chains are the natural order of things and that they are in these chains for a reason other than people put them there. An author concerned with the subject of slavery wrote that if you control a man's thoughts you need not concern yourself with his actions. Orwell takes this to its logical conclusion: if you control the language available to a man, you have complete and utter control of his thought process. Even today, we are seeing people attempting to control thought process through language. ""Person with"", and so forth.Some people are so dense, so committed to believing what they want to believe or what they are told to believe, that they fail to notice something very peculiar about Nineteen Eighty-Four. The last ten or so pages of the novel, after we learn of Winston's ultimate fate and the ultimate horror of Oceania, explain further the principles of this strange new language. We are told how the vocabulary is deliberately split into three distinct families with very distinct purposes, who uses words from each family, and why the people who use these words use them.Put simply, if Orwell had known just how stupid people would get a mere half-century after his death, he would have instructed publishers to print ""THIS STORY IS ABOUT HOW THE SCOPE OF YOUR WORLD IS DETERMINED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF WORDS TO EXPRESS CONCEPTS"", only dumbed down into words that those surveillance-focused mouth-breathers can understand on literally every page.And I have not even begun to discuss the story itself yet.In Oceania, we are told, we have a class structure with the Inner Party, the Outer Party, and the proles. What we are not told, and I suspect Orwell did this on purpose, is who ultimately benefits from the squalor and deprivation that every Oceanic individual lives in. Which ultimately brings both the audience and Winston to ask his Inner Party interrogator the ultimate question. Does Big Brother, the figurehead of the Party, the source of many an above-mentioned idiot's confusion concerning what the story is about, exist? When the question is asked, the interrogator, the only individual Winston meets who appears to have any capacity to provide a definitive answer, does not appear to properly understand the question on first try. The Party exists, Ingsoc exists, ergo Big Brother exists. But Winston displays why he is the protagonist in this story (essentially, he is a little too smart for his own good) and asks the interrogator the same question with a different phrasing. Ultimately, he asks the way a scientist would ask. I occupy a space in the physical universe that nobody else can occupy at the same time, breathe air, drink water, eat food, piss, shit, and so forth. In that sense of existing, does Big Brother exist? The interrogator never gives a real answer, simply dismissing the question as irrelevant.But there are real figures alleged to have existed on our world that also behave or are held by others in a similar manner to Big Brother. It is illegal under penalty of torture, psychological destruction, and eventually death to not love Big Brother. Big Brother is held to be responsible for everything the Party wants you to believe is good (and if you do not believe it to be good, see above). Big Brother is held to have rid the world of all manner of evils and problems that you will suffer the above fate for acknowledging are still very much present and accounted for. Fornication is now your duty to the Party, to produce a new generation of Party members who will go on living by the above. But if you should happen to feel anything about the individual you happen to be fornicating with, well, again, see above.There are people from a part of the world that I will not name here who will murder people for pointing out how similar the above (Big Brother) looks to the historical figure that they will have us love and accept and bow down at the ""feet"" of or else.That has always bugged me about Nineteen Eighty-Four. Is Big Brother a religious figure no different from the other religious figures, not existing in the present and of dubious historical evidence at best? Or is there a living individual who makes all of the decisions at the very top of the party, who gets swapped out upon death, and is ultimately just known as Big Brother? Orwell's genius in this part of the story is that although the story is satisfying without needing to know the answer to this conundrum is (beyond its real-world connection I am trying to reference), one could fill a book with theorems about whether this figurehead exists in the literal sense that Winston asks after. Big Brother does not need to watch you when you so intensely believe he is watching you that you start asking yourself if the colour and consistency of your droppings is pleasing to him.Julia is simultaneously the most confounding and most interesting character in Nineteen Eighty-Four. Nobody's exact age is ever revealed in the story, but she is easily the most exuberant and ""youthful"" character the story offers. Orwell was keenly aware that the combination of legal majority and youth brings a great desire to explore and discover what is possible in the world proper. After a fashion, he even expresses this knowledge through Julia's mouth. You want to have a good time, the Party wants to stop you from having it. Although this summary is a misunderestimation of the Party's true motives, Julia does at times like these give us an interesting window into how people born into this thought-in-a-box world might respond to it. The immediate, unerring compliance that many think will occur is instead met with a ""okay, I will follow you as far as I need to before I can get a little break and enjoy myself"" sort of response. Julia's purpose in the story is both to provide the audience with a glimmer of hope that this abyss Humanity has fallen into is not permanent, and demonstrate that there is a root of rebellion that that perhaps bring the Party down if stoked correctly.But this is an Orwell novel, and Orwell novels are about Human nature. Possibilities like Julia have not only been thought of well in advance, they have been incorporated and planned for in the programme. During the interrogation, we are given faint hints as to how this process is going for Julia, and they are not pleasant. The interrogator tells us they have never seen someone ""come over"" so quickly, and whilst there is the possibility that he is just telling Winston this in order to further soften him up, the scene late in the novel where they meet up once more for the final time suggests that she really has broken as quickly and utterly as suggested.A final test of audience stupidity is offered early on in the story when Winston is writing his reflections. He writes a date in the journal, ending it in the year Nineteen Eighty-Four. Idiots will proclaim oh, that year was long ago, the danger has passed us by. This relates to one of my favourite rules about writing fiction set in the future. If you feel a need to be specific about the date when the events are taking place, then do, but explain first in a plausible manner how the world got from where the reader sits to what the reader is reading. Orwell delivers a king hit when writing that the year is Nineteen Eighty-Four. Because everything in the records is falsified and then made truth with the ""believe this or else"" technique, as he himself reflects internally, Winston has no sodding idea what year it really is. It could well be twenty-nine eighty-four for all he knows to the contrary.Although with the way people with near-monopolies over the flow of information announce alliances with ""charities"" determined to exterminate people who are hard-wired to think differently, there is still a great probability that Winston was really living a scant few years from now. ""It cannot happen here"" is a phrase one should expect to hear in a place where ""it"" will happen.For an English author living in the early to mid twentieth century, Orwell understood the Human animal a lot better than a lot of the Human animals of today ever will."

729,Stephen Kozeniewski,"Yup, real genius. I remember being enamored with this book in high school. ANIMAL FARM is the superior satire, but, hey, you really can't get by in life without reading 1984. It's kind of like the reduction ad absurdum of all modern political discourse."
730,Ross Nugent,"What to say about 1984? I'll keep it brief, my mind might explode were I to illustrate all of the complex parallels drawn and comparisons made in one of Orwell's finest novels. Though the story may seem character central at first, we become aware that Orwell is conveying a message, or better, a warning, concerning the dangers of Totalitarianism. It is an alternate reality, showing the extreme side of the totalitarian ideology, if it wasn't extreme enough. I feel that one would enjoy this novel even more, were they to have a brief, or even in-depth knowledge, of Stalinist Russia. I do not wish to spoil this book, but I would entreat anyone with any interest in Orwell, or the philosophies that dictate societal structure to read this incredible book. "

732,Waleed Diaa,"I've delayed my final review for about 3 weeks to have enough time thinking how I could use my mere words to describe such powerful, insightful and great a book.George Orwell's 1984 was in every possible way able to entertain and impress me. This novel could fill it's reader with doubt yet amazement during the reader's journey of reading it.You can't help but smell the lousy smell of Oceania and live through it's people's struggle and control your thought in order to prevent it from any thought-crime while reading through the pages of the novel. You can't help too but feel you're being watched by Big Brother's watchful gazing eyes. You'll be more thrilled with every page as your journey goes.With no monstrous amount of description for the world he created -save that of Newspeak-, Orwell could make it very familiar to the reader and could easily indulge us in his story.I can't fail to mention that the story till now embodies and represents what many major powers do nowadays in every single aspect. So it'd be totally normal if, during your reading it, you thought that it was just written in the last decade.Finally, I've really enjoyed this masterpiece and I'd like to recommend it to everyone regardless the preference, age and gender."

735,Francesca,"Agghiacciante. L’uomo ridotto al nulla, peggio di un morto vivente, senza interiorità, né pensiero proprio. Una vuota cassa risonante di slogan inculcati da altri. L’individuo in quanto tale (essere che ha coscienza di se stesso ed è diverso dagli altri) non esiste. Niente ha più significato (storia, passato, arte, sentimenti, …), eccetto quanto decreta e stabilisce, a proprio piacimento, chi detiene il potere.Il finale, inoltre, non lascia spazio ad alcuna speranza di cambiamento. Il protagonista si illude che qualcosa, anche in un futuro lontano possa cambiare, che vale la pena lottare, ma ogni sua illusione viene drasticamente calpestata, spezzata, schiacciata brutalmente.Attonita, mi sorge la domanda più inquietante: è fantascienza o realtà? "
736,djamb,"Como posso ter lido tantos livros antes deste, não sei. Da primeira à última página, George Orwell cativou-me com a sua visão de um mundo totalitário assente em regimes verdadeiros, mas com um enorme laivo de imaginação e hipnotismo no que respeita ao relacionamento social e político. À semelhança de “Animal farm”, o autor brinda-nos com uma crítica profunda ao totalitarismo e à pior face da natureza humana, numa narrativa tão fria e crua que não pude deixar de imaginar o que será viver num regime tão estrito.“1984″ começa por nos dar a conhecer a sociedade onde o protagonista, Winston Smith, vive. Através dos seus olhos, conhecemos rapidamente a forma opressiva em que Londres vive e lida diariamente, nomeadamente na capacidade de esconder emoções e de agradar ao Partido das mais variadas formas e sempre sobre o olhar atento dos seus trabalhadores. Ao longo da história, questionamo-nos acerca da existência do Grande Irmão e dos verdadeiros ideais de quem rodeia Winston, embora percebamos rapidamente que poucas ou nenhumas hipóteses há de contornar um sistema tão rígido e com tantos olhos. Na verdade, Winston tenta lutar contra o sistema e opta por pertencer à minoria que lutará durante décadas ou séculos, se necessário, para alcançar a liberdade do povo.Desde a criação de ministérios com objectivos específicos para controlar e castigar a população, a construção de um Partido omnipresente no tempo e no espaço, a transição para um idioma novo, a recriação permanente do passado e a capacidade de adaptação das pessoas através do controlo assente no medo e no castigo, George Orwell demonstra-nos que qualquer mensagem é passível de ser transmitida através da linguagem mais simples e com os formatos mais banais. O rompimento com o actual idioma, a actualização permanente do passado, a observação atenta pelos ecrãs e o desaparecimento de revolucionários traduz pura e simplesmente o objectivo de controlar o pensamento e de criar uma sociedade feita à medida e o autor consegue fazê-lo de forma cativante e inesquecível.Ao longo do livro, apercebemo-nos da forma minuciosa como Orwell criou e estruturou a história: é complexa e quase tangível. É dotada de ínfimos pormenores e não deixa escapar qualquer resposta. É um retrato da sede de poder e de controlo e da obediência e disciplina. No fundo, é uma visão arrepiante e não tão longe da realidade quanto isso. É um livro a ler… e reler!"
737,Ayesha,"I am a fool for not reading this sooner. I read Animal Farm and enjoyed it and then just forgot about Orwell. Fool move, I agree.This book is a revelation. An unpleasant, depressing, horrible, painful revelation. I find if difficult to believe that a book written so long ago could make complete and utter sense today, years and years later. But make sense it does. Too much sense.1984 leaves you with a sinking feeling of despair and self-awareness. George Orwell was a mad genius and a prophet, rolled into one. This book will stay with you. Forever. Because what is more permanent than the realisation that there is no hope, no good, nothing. Big Brother is ALL."
738,Haniophobic ,"Orwell's predictions are spot on. All of his theories about how in the future there is no privacy and no freedom are true. If you are in any way interested in a book that will question almost every thing about our lives, then this is the book for you. And as for me, I'm frankly scared of what the world has come to. You'll realize this once you read 1984. "
739,Lidia,"Orwell said it himself:“The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.” This is one of those books that consumes your energy and make you reconsider your opinions about life, manipulation in different forms of government and triggers a range of emotions from frightment to pure anger. This is by far the best and the worst novel I have ever read. Furthermore, I was quite impressed about the tough circumstances Orwell was in when writing it, struggling a terrible illness and still he managed to deliver such a masterpiece. Albeit, I believe the title ""The last man in Europe"" would've been more suitable. "

742,Ariel,"I remember when I was in 7th grade my baby-sitter who was 17 at the time asked me my thoughts on this book for a book report she was doing. She had told my mother she was doing the book report, and my mother said it was one of my favorites, so she asked me about it. I felt So Cool. I remember I got it from a used bookstore we used to go to, either at the suggestion of my (older) best friend at the time, or my mother. I can't remember, now. This is the first adult book I ever obsessively read and reread. I did so because it's awesome, but also because of the sex scenes. I thought somehow (?) people would know that I was just reading the sex scenes over and over again, so I reread the entire book multiple times. It is still a book I reread occasionally, but not for the sex scenes. This book has probably impacted my thinking more than any other book. In particular, there's the scene where (spoilers) O'Brien has him strapped down, post-torture (well, I suppose this is part of the torture). Anyway, O'Brien has him strapped down, and he's trying to convince Winston that he (O'Brien) can float (I think). He says, well, if I believe I floated up out of this chair and hovered in the air, and you believe it too, then it makes no difference whether I actually did or not. BAM. Changed everything for me. I mean, what do you even SAY about goddamn 1984, other than recount personal memories of it?"
743,Valeria Bradosche-pallares,"The book 1984, written by George Orwell, tells of a society that is much like an exaggerated version of the 21st century. New ideas are not welcome, and whatever the Party (government) says is what happens and what has always happened. Oceania, the protagonist Winston Smith's home, is at war with Eastasia. When allies are switched and Oceania and Eastasia are no longer at war, all the books, written records, papers and newspapers are changed to say that Oceania was never at war with Eastasia, instead it has always been fighting against Eurasia. All the citizens of Oceania are brainwashed to believe exactly what all the written records say, and anyone who thinks otherwise is accused of thoughtcrime, which is believing is something other than what the government says. They are then sent to the Ministry of Love, which is in reality a place where they torture people who commit thoughtcrime. These people are tortured until they believe what the government say, and then they Vanish. No one is allowed to ask questions about where they went, because all the written records of that person are destroyed so that no one can find any proof that they ever existed. Big Brother is the head of the Party, and everyone should look up to and worship him, even though no one has ever seen what he really looks like. Winston Smith, a man who is around his 50's, does not believe in the ideals of the Party, but he goes on with life because there is no other alternative, except torture. ""It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage,"" is what Winston told himself when he wanted to rebel (Orwell 73). One day, Winston falls in love with a girl named Julia, and they meet each other in secret until they discover a secret society that is against the Party and Big Brother, called the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood is led by a man named O'Brien, who gives Winston a book that says how a proper member of the Brotherhood should act. Julia and Winston keep meeting in clandestine, until one day they are both arrested for committing thoughtcrime. The person who arrested them was O'Brien. He put them in separate buildings, and tortured each one until they treasured Big Brother and accepted everything the Party said. O'Brein used reasoning such as ""we, the Party, control all records, and we control all memories. Then we control the past, do we not?"" (Orwell 667). Winston began deteriorating, to such an extent that when they released him he was fat, alcoholic and smelly. He saw Julia again, but she was disappointed in him and they no longer loved each other. The book 1984 by George Orwell shows what our society would be like if people weren't free to think what they want. "
744,Muridi,"1984 by George Orwell is a book of political fiction, propaganda and social issues. The book was about a place controlled by a party that only gave some privileges to their people. The main character of the book is a man that goes against the political party in control because he doesn't like the party and wants change.In addition, I enjoyed this book mainly because of how detail it was and how it explained the theme and setting. All the points that the main character believed in was well explained. Another reason I enjoyed this book was because the politics involved with the book. After reading this book I highly recommend it to people who enjoy political rebellion and also people who enjoy being mind blown."
745,Sebastiano,"Arguably Orwell's greatest work and most famous dystopian novel, 1984 was truly a profoundly impacting experience. The story is set in Airstrip One, an alternate communist version of the United Kingdom. The main protagonist, Winston Smith, starts questioning the dogmas of Ingsoc (English Socialism) and of its enigmatic, Draconian leader, Big Brother. All citizens of Airstrip One, which has been annexed along with its empire by the US, are constantly surveilled by the Thought police through a never stopping TV called the Telescreen. Winston ends up growing more and more skeptical about the Party and ends up defying its orders by entering a relationship and trying to enter the Brotherhood, a rebellious organization formed by one of the party's ex-foremost leaders during the revolution. Winston ends up being tricked and is captured by the Thought police and is tortured until he loves Big Brother. 1984 is a magnificent novel that provides lots of food for thought. Orwell never clearly states if Big Brother really exists, if the entire world has really converted entirely to communism, or if even the Brotherhood is real. Everything we know is through what Winston perceives and through the doctrines of the Party. The state of living that is described in the novel is a remarkably similar to what individuals felt in the U.S.S.R., and the gloomy mood set forth by the author creates quite a vivid feel of Communism in general. The ending was quite unexpected and was worth the read. Overall I would recommend this classic to anyone and is one of my favorite all time books."
746,Mina Opada,"Mind-boggling, slightly disturbing, illuminating, and amazingly accurate. A novel that makes you think about what you think you're thinking.Before reading the book, I was well-aware of the entire plot of the novel down to its conclusion, thanks to ""Video Sparknotes"" on YouTube. However, the summary did not suffice to illustrate the revolutionary concept (and purpose) of the novel. It was beautifully written. The detailed descriptions of situations, train of thought of the protagonist, and the justifications of ""the other side"" will immerse you so much that it will disturb your beliefs (and also provides the opportunity for self-evaluation), induce opposition, protest and passion in your head, and appreciation of the reality you're in.The idea that humans can be controlled, manipulated, and dehumanized in such the manner described in the novel is frightening. I have found myself continually evaluating our present society, appreciating (and promising myself to properly and responsibly exercise) the gift of free will, and questioning the very definition of ""truth"" and what it encompasses. If the human race would happen to fall into such a state wherein the moral compass of the people deemed as leaders are egregiously flawed (yet somehow justified), I could only hope that human nature, instinct, and religion would prevent us from plummeting to chaos.PS: After reading the novel, I'm quite certain that a visit to sparknotes, skimming through chapter summaries and analyses, will help ease your pain. ;)"
747,Alberto,"Mi novela favorita de toda la vida. Maravillosa de principio a fin. Una maravilla distopica que narra la brutalidad de la dictadura y la cultura del miedo que te lleva a dejar de pensar por ti mismo y obedecer ciegamente lo que te dicen que debes pensar. Una población que idolotra a un personaje que pareciera ser imaginario y al mismo tiempo ser omnipresente y mirarlo todo. Este libro es una metáfora de muchas cosas, del culto al héroe, de la censura periodística, del miedo, de los regímenes autoritarios.Pero a mí, personalmente lo que más me gusta es que pese a que su eje central es una novela de ciencia ficción, de transfondo pone una ""historia de amor""(tal vez sólo de sexo). El personaje principal, alguien con quien la mayoría de los hombres nos podemos identificar: un tipo con complejos, no el típico pretty boy valiente, sino un hombre muy realista, inseguro con su cuerpo(tiene varices y dentadura postiza) pese a todos sus defectos en su mente pasan ideas maravillosas, que logran interesar a una mujer(muy atractiva) por su manera independiente de pensar. Para mi una obra maestra, pese que a muchos les puede aburrir, pues carece de escenas de acción. Pero he ahí su grandeza, pues los diálogos son magistrales ""Nosotros somos los muertos. Nuestra verdadera vida está en el futuro. Formaremos parte de él como polvo y astillas de huesos. Pero ese futuro quizás dure más de mil años. Por ahora sólo podemos ir extendiendo el area de la cordura de poco a poco"""
748,Aries,Amava il Grande Fratello. Ogni volta che penso a questa frase di chiusura un brivido mi scorre lungo la schiena. Assieme al più soft Fahrenheit 451 di Bradbury è uno di quei romanzi che ogni giorno potrebbe diventare realtè. Da leggere.
749,Isaac,"I have FINALLY read this book. Sometimes when a book is recommended to you so many times, one feels one already knows enough about it, and therefore actually reading it is not important.It seems I was deeply wrong.The good:-It works as a novel! (surprise!) Unlike Starship Troopers, which is 10% novel and 90% rant, 1984 is roughly 65% novel and 35% rant.-Orwell has the gift of describing characters. Everyone is vivid. Everyone has a visual presence in the mind's eye. The characters also speak like real people, in informal dialogues.-Very well structured. Each of the 3 parts has a distinct feel and the transitions turn on unexpected plot twists that provide impetus for the reader to keep reading. Orwell has the skill of a seasoned mystery novelist.-The primary horror is not the surveillance, or even the lack of freedom, but the concept of double-think! Something that most fans do not underline enough imo. -The ending is utterly and totally complete.The bad (possibly):-A significant portion of first half is probably the product of some kind of male adolescent fantasy - especially since Winston doesn't seem like a very sexy bloke. It's almost Twilight for men...-The sections from ""the book"" are a unapologetic exercise in heavy-handed exposition and wall-of-text infodumping. I don't really mind this though since the prose is well written and densely packed with content.-Winston's inner thoughts are often shocking for the sensibilities of the modern reader. He displays partial misogynist thoughts (somewhat subverted later in the novel) and definite misopedic thoughts.-This book has definitely made some people TOO PARANOID. I mean, get a grip. The world is bad, but it's not this bad yet. Don't feed the luddites!I suppose what impressed me most is the energy and liveliness of 1984. I was expecting a dry and grim ""prophecy"" for the morbidly minded, and instead, I got something mysterious and soul stirring. O'Brian is the best character here and...I think I like him even more than a certain character in Fahrenheit 451 (it's a spoiler to say who!). I love to hear a good rant once in a while."
750,Alberte,"I have always wanted to read 1984. It's one of those books that everyone seems to buzz about now and again - and with increasing intensity as time has rolled on. I cannot imagine a time before now when it has been more relevant or applicable. I read this in two days flat, and it is safe to say that I have never read a more hauntingly creepy book. While seeming an eerie echo of a disturbing sci-fi-inspired nightmare, it is also vaguely familiar. The telescreens, the surveillance, the continuous war, the inequality and the Thought Police... It all remains in my mind like a horrible idea of a probable version of the future, and I just cannot shake off the dread. It inspires hope, but it also invokes despair. Hopelessness. It provides ammunition for the time ahead, when we are inevitably going to face increasing levels of desperation and depression, if we do not manage to make some changes to the structure of society - and our perception of the world. I have earmarked many pages in this book for future reference, and one paragraph struck me in particular:'If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred and selfrighteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate.' (p. 204)I highly recommend reading 1984. It is a wretched, damned thing but it is necessary. However - do so at your own risk. There may be night terrors to come. (Also, I listened to Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' while reading, and it has proven a near perfect soundtrack.)"
751,Ryland Dinneen,"For the past few weeks, ever since I started reading 1984, I have burrowed myself into a literary hole. My main topic of conversations has been 1984. My thoughts have all been 1984. My dreams have been 1984. My life has been 1984.Yeah, I'm aware that everybody says that about books they love. But one never seems to understand it until it happens to them, or at least that goes for me. I have been completely absorbed by the terrifying world of 1984, and throughout the pages have been putting myself into it, simply because I have found it impossible not to do so.For those of you who don't know, 1984 is the story of a totalitarian future where the country of Oceania is watched by Big Brother (an unknown and mysterious figure) and the Party, an organization and government that handles everything. Hellbent on destroying any rebellion, they have created the notion of Thoughtcrime, which practically explains itself - from subtle facial movements to words uttered while sleeping, Thoughtcrime is punishable by death, and ""for those with original thoughts"", they have invented Room 101 - the worst place in the world. Winston is a man living in the world of 1984, who works for The Party. He has always questioned the morals of the society, but until he finds love with Julia, another Party worker, he has never done anything about it. I can't reveal anything more because if I did I would be committing the greatest crime in novel history - spoiling a really good book. So I'll leave it at that.1984 seems all too real, and is definitely one of the most disturbing and terrifying books I have ever read, yet not in a Stephen King or Clive Barker kind of way. It is terrifying in the sense that it actually raises the thought of a future that is exactly like the one Orwell so brilliantly depicts. What if our every move is governed by some sort of secret God figure, and any act of rebellion can lead to your deepest, darkest fears? It is that constant sense of being watched that is most scary, that if we even sneeze in public, or exercise an innocent nervous tick, that single act might be the cause of our death. But other than this, how can we prove that we are the ones in the right? If, according to The Party, 2 + 2 = 5, how can we possibly prove that it is wrong? Orwell explores those questions in the novel (more towards the end) and when Winston asks these questions, so does the reader. If an all-powerful government tells us that our memories are false, that the one memory we have of our childhood didn't actually happen, how can we question it? In this society, The Party controls the present, and in controlling the present it also seems to control the past. When the Thought Police take someone away for an act of thoughtcrime, they have from that moment on never existed. If they don't exist in the present, this must mean they don't exist in the past, and there is no way of proving that theory wrong - the only way we see the world is through our own minds. So if the past has already occurred, then it doesn't exist now, and in another famous 1984 term ""doublethink"", this means it never existed in the first place. Food for thought, huh.Orwell writes the novel at the perfect pace. He never takes too much time to explain anything, yet is descriptive enough to be both captivating and remarkably intelligent. And I can say that not often is a book both brilliant and extremely entertaining; most of the time you must pick either one. But Orwell, oh Orwell, you seem to juggle both functions magnificently. For that, its disturbing familiarity, and the altogether emotional explosion this book entails, 1984 will continue to be read, and become more and more powerful as time goes on and Big Brother becomes even more relevant to our society. "
752,Matt Micucci,"Being 21, I wondered how i got on without ever reading it before.Now that I have, I must say, it was one of the most extraordinaryliterary experiences I encountered. Orwell's novel, with its portrayal of the future negative utopia coming from a time still scarred by totalitarianism, strikes me for its originality, its modern style, and the way that its futuristic portrayal finds a match in today's media crazed world. A work that will inspire many generationsof writers, but certainly not only writers. "
753,Aishwarya Saxena,"WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.Those are the three tenets of George Orwell’s uber-dystopian world of Oceania, which is a mash-up of UK, the Americas and Australia. 1984 is Orwell’s disturbing image of a post-World War II future where he thought democratic values wouldn’t survive. Instead, we have the Party led by this dude called Big Brother (if you thought the show was annoying, wait till you get a load of this) and there are “telescreens”, which are just TVs spouting government propaganda and spying on your actions 24/7. The world is divided into Party members (Inner and Outer) and the “proles”, which, if any of you have ever heard of Marx, is pretty self-explanatory [Harry Potter fans, think Deathly Hallows and Magic is Might]. Except the fact that these uneducated proles are 85% of the population and they are effectively controlled by the Party by no concrete regulations since there are no laws in this world. The only wrong you can do is “Thoughtcrime”, and that too can only be done by Party members. If caught, all traces of you existing will be destroyed and you will be vaporized or turned into an “unperson”. Frightening yet cool.Our hero, for lack of a better word, is Winston Smith, a morose, paranoid, frail 39-year old who is an editor in the Minitrue (Ministry of Truth), where he falsifies historical records to keep up with the ever-changing party line and deleting the existence of people who have been vaporized, secretly hoping for an invitation to the Brotherhood, the hush-hush anti-government organisation. Just like Joseph Stalin used to airbrush his “fallen comrades” from photographs and remove their names from books and newspapers. Constantly being forced to rewrite it, Winston is fascinated by the past and makes clumsy attempts what truly happened, either by talking to really old drunks in prole bars or going to antique shops and buying journals and coral paperweights. Total badass.He falls in love with Julia, a hot member of the Junior Anti-Sex League. Yes, they existed, because in this world one of the Party’s aims is to take the joy out of sex. Children are born through “artsem” and as soon as they grow up they join this terrible organisation called the Spies where they get to listen in on doors and report suspicious activities of adults they don’t like. Try making your kid eat veggies now, Mom. Anyway, Winston and Julia have the oddest ever. He dreams of raping and killing her and she falls passionately in love with him by stalking him. Total fairy tale romance. They have sex in hidden meadows and bombed churches before, finally, getting a room. And real bread and jam. And coffee with real sugar. And Winston gets invited to join the brotherhood with his own copy of the manifesto and all.Wait a minute. I thought they were living in a super-surveillance state in a state of perpetual war. Yes, they still are. Except apparently Winston’s been having the biggest lucky streak of his life and never thinks to question it. Then he gets caught. Shocker. Which is when the real fun begins in the Ministry of Love (aka Miniluv, LOL). Starvation. Beatings. Torture. Betrayal. And, RATS. The book is rife with symbolism from wartime Britain and Russia-bashing. For instance, Oceania changing allies when it suited them (Russia and Nazi Germany); Goldstein being a facsimile of Leon Trotsky, animal transformations and all and Big Brother as Stalin. The Thought Police could be the NKVD. Even the lovely contractions are derived from Mother Russia (Dialectical Materialism=DiaMat). The slogan “Our, new happy life” a copy of “Life has become better"". Personally, I think of NaMo’s “Achhe din aa gaye”.Jokes aside, I think 1984 is one of the most well-written and chilling books I have ever read. Orwell, a democratic socialist at heart, has brilliantly demonstrated the perils of authoritarianism. Written in the immediate aftermath of World War II, it shows a chilling view of the future as a place where the language has been pared to so great an extent that it only serves the purpose of officialdom and people have been reduced to being tools of the Party. The “proles” are nothing more than the silent masses subjugated to the elites. Your thoughts, your home, your family, your leisure time are all subject to constant surveillance and you like it. It shows how the freedoms we take for granted and the past we derive them from are so fragile and can be snatched away so easily by those in power.I would recommend this book to everyone who loves a good read. It is a searing political and social commentary as well as thriller. Read for the masterful way Orwell has used the English language. Read because it is as relevant as it was 65 years ago. The book may be a bit dry but Winston humanizes the more abstract themes in a relatable manner. It is a very worthwhile read with rich and layered meanings. It even has cool dialogues like “We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness” and “Until they become conscious they will never rebel and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious”. So if you’ve somehow managed to avoid this book in your school years, do yourself a favour and read it today. If you’ve read it and hated it, give it another try. "

755,Shayantani Das," DOUBLE PLUS GOOD This is the scariest book ever written. From the starting sentence to the ending line, it was just spectacular and really creepy. What also really impressed me was the skillful way in which, Orwell had not only devised a completely credible society, but had also developed the language, the politics, the motives, and all of it in the very same book. I am also in awe of Orwell himself. Such a great thinker, only he could have written such a story. This one will stay with me for a very long time."
756,Ayunda,"I regretted not reading this book earlier. It has always been in the list of books I must read eventually and I finally decided (at random) to give it a try.The beginning was a little slow and weird for me. But then the whole story just swept me away and by the middle of the book, I was hooked and I just had to keep reading. The whole book for me was just unique and different from any kind of book. For instance there weren't that many characters and the main character Winston is, for me, not very heroic like any other main characters. He's not very attractive, he's a little weird, he's old, but he's courageous and you just can't help liking him.But the thing that really made the book special was of course the setting of the story. It's creepy and scary to read it and some parts gave me chills but of course we could definitely see that kind of life in our current world to actually happen in real life. So that made the story even more interesting.My favourite part of the book was nearing the end when Winston was being caught and all. That to me was the creepiest, most goosebump-y part and the whole story and how it was written was amazing to experience. And of course throughout the story you just can't help but wonder what will happen at the end. Because along the way all I could guess is that the character probably dies. But the ending wasn't predictable at all and it left me speechless and blown away.The whole story idea and the characters of this novel is excellent and although there were some parts that were a little boring, the plot was amazing and everything really made the readers think and reflect upon the story, which is what I really like about a book."
757,angela,"Lo que hay entre 1984 y yo es una historia de amor que comenzó hace 4 años y todavía dura. La primera vez que me lo leí tenía 15 años y lo hice porque debía examinarme de él al final del trimestre. Lo escogí entre otros muchos candidatos que nos habían sido sugeridos por algo tan simple como que hablaba de una tal “Gran Hermano”. No es que sea seguidora de ese tipo de programas, es más, prefiero no ver nada antes que eso, pero me llamó la atención que se mencionara aquello, me chocó bastante. Dado que por aquel entonces llevaba bastante mal lo referente a organizar el tiempo para realizar las tareas del instituto, terminé leyéndome del tirón más de la mitad del libro el día antes del examen. Pero aún así me encantó y supe que aquella lectura me acompañaría para siempre. Me hizo reflexionar sobremanera sobre el importante papel que juega la información y la Historia en nuestras vidas y lo fáciles que son de manipular sin que nos demos ni cuenta. Cómo obviamos a veces el conocimiento cuando es un pilar fundamental en nuestra formación como personas. De hecho, desde entonces, siempre he dicho que 1984 era mi libro favorito.En consecuencia a esto último, se me ocurrió leerlo de nuevo cuatro años después, para comprobar si todavía seguía gustándome tanto como antes o si me había dejado llevar por la emoción del momento y el haber descubierto una literatura más inteligente y de carácter más político. Eso sí, si algo tenía claro es que en esta ocasión iba a tomármelo con calma, iba a saborear cada uno de los capítulos de esta historia. Me alegro mucho de haberlo hecho porque he descubierto detalles que pasé por alto en la primera lectura, he comprendido mucho mejor a los personajes, pero sobre todo, no he podido evitar sentir cierto nudo en el estómago de pensar que esa realidad que Orwell nos plantea en la que todo está dominado por el Partido y donde las personas cada vez son más ignorantes y, por lo tanto, más maleables, no dista tanto del mundo en el que vivimos. Quizá en 1984 todo esté un poco más exagerado pero, a grandes rasgos, las similitudes son abrumadoras. El conformismo de cada uno de los ciudadanos de Oceanía (que es el continente en el que transcurre la acción), que asumía que si el Partido decía que algo era así, entonces debía ser verdad. El poco interés de Julia por todo aquello que no le afectara a ella, dándole igual cualquier manipulación que se hubiera podido hacer, siempre y cuando no tuviese nada que ver con su persona. El mantenimiento de una guerra constante para evitar que el pueblo se diera cuenta de que el verdadero enemigo no se encontraba en los países extranjeros sino en su propio Gobierno. La batalla interior de Winston por hacer lo correcto o hacer lo que se espera de él, el cuestionarse constantemente si en realidad está loco por no comulgar con el pensamiento del Partido, su necesidad de demostrar que todo es una mentira, que debemos abrir los ojos y no dejar que nos engañen así como así, que, unidos, el poder ya no recae sobre unos pocos, sino que vuelve a donde siempre debería haber estado, a las manos del pueblo. El muro con el que siempre se choca el pobre de Winston: la fe ciega en el Gran Hermano de los otros “camaradas” y la falta de consciencia de los “proles” sobre lo que en verdad está sucediendo.Y es que Winston Smith es un personaje redondo, un personaje que representa una serie de ideales que no todo el mundo tiene y que, además, está dispuesto a defender hasta el final. Desde el momento en que acepta que algo no marcha bien con el sistema político y social en el que vive, comienza a crecer y a desarrollar su propia forma de pensar, cada vez más crítico y más sediento por saber la verdad de lo ocurrido, no sólo en el presente, sino también en el pasado. No le importa poner en riesgo su vida si consigue hacer ver a otra persona que todo eso es una mentira, que en realidad, son simples marionetas cuyos hilos son movidos por unos pocos señores que viven en la abundancia mientras los demás se ven obligados a malvivir. Pero con Winston, Orwell no creó ni mucho menos a un héroe que no le teme a nada. De hecho, en los últimos capítulos se aprecia perfectamente que, finalmente, es un ser humano, con sus temores y sus flaquezas, que no tiene una voluntad de hierro como puede parecer en un principio y eso es lo que más me gusta del personaje, que es una persona real.Por si la historia no fuera suficiente, el estilo literario de George Orwell es impecable, sin dejar de ser elegante a la hora de escribir, narra los hecho sin adornarlos excesivamente, dejando claro que lo que le interesa es transmitir una historia, una serie de ideas, y que la forma en la que estén escritas es algo secundario, si bien, de extrema importancia para atrapar la atención del lector.1984 es una novela extraordinariamente inteligente que, una vez acabada, no queda olvidada en una estantería hasta el fin de los días, sino que te acompaña siempre, para bien o para mal. Termina formando parte de ti. Una lectura obligada, vaya."
758,Theresa Leone Davidson,I graduated high school in 1984 and had to read this the first time then. I appreciated it a lot more this time around - great book! Poor Winston...a true classic about what the world looks like when EVERYTHING we do is being watched.
759,Victor O. Krausskopf,"What to say... it's a Classic. Perhaps interesting is what the Yugoslav political activist and author Borislav Pekic said in a lecture about ""The Historical Novel and the Historical Reality"" held in 1984 at the UCL in London, in which he surprised his audience by naming 1984 as ""one of the best historical novels ever written"".""The second example, of course, will arouse your surprise. It is George Orwell's 1984, the year through which we think we are passing. I say think, for in its essential meaning, we have in fact already past through it long ago, and the futuristic, negatively utopian form of the work which has deceived readers and critics alike, is in fact the artistic mask for one of the most perfect metahistorical novels of all time. For the basic condition which characterizes the society of Orwell's pseudo-future, is that of Doublethink. And Double-think is the content of the whole of human's history, from that very moment when mankind, at the dawn of consciousness, through the invention of the first tool, the innocent, and useful primeval forbear of our present-day atom bomb, once and for all set out along the path of the lower, but easier materialist alternative of life, leaving behind only double-think excuses for the spiritual one. This our civilization would not be schizophrenic if we were not aware of the mistaken nature of our choice. To overcome that awareness, which would have made history nonsensical for us in advance, we had to forget that this spiritual alternative and the possibility for it ever existed, and then forget that we had forgotten about it. We managed to achieve this by the complicated system of Double-think in the different areas of human life of human awareness. In the work of organizing The Global Lie which would quickly take over both the destiny and the history of mankind, there came together rationalistic ideas of progress, the deterministic cults, the various philosophies of so-called needs, and in the historical field, social utopias and pseudo-humanist doctrines.""

I sobbed when I finished this.Orwell brings some hard truths, and some of our deepest fears, to life in 1984. Why do I say, don't read this, do read this? Because, if you are comfortable with who you are right now, this book will rock you to your core. If you don't want that, don't read it; but, on the other side, the truths within it are things that I believe we need to hear.

764,Jessa,"Ignorance is strength.Freedom is slavery.War is peace.A brilliantly made novel set in a dystopian world where every single human virtue and instinct was prohibited and violently punished. Was it still possible to be human?For Winston Smith, it was. Well, in the beginning anyway. He was the courageous protagonist who thought that there was still an end to cruel - and, rather inconsistent - reality that he lived in. He was interesting character and I enjoyed hearing his thoughts. The question that he posted to himself would make the reader even question himself. Albeit quite gloomy in character (they all were gloomy), I really liked his character.The other characters also left an imprint in my mind. At times, I had a profound distaste for them that I could not help but like. For who would not appreciate a character who could invoke such a strong emotion, right?The plot seemed unrealistic to me, as was the political environment of the book. I was not convinced that a group of people would be that powerful to be able to ensure that a superstate would exist in perfect isolation. The idea seemed far-fetched yet the reasoning and the logic had been so convincing that I feared living in the era. At the same time, I could not help but be amazed by the genius at which Orwell managed to conceive of such idea.The killing of human values and instinct was another horrible thing to imagine. To fear your own family, marry mainly for procreation, have your privacy invaded and have your freedom prohibited were just some of the conditions that were present in the book. One could not help but wonder how can one continue living and if the essence of humanity still lived. It was way too horrible even to imagine and yet, you understand it. In its severely twisted way, you would be able to comprehend why the government did it and why the people continued to suffer. But that does not necessarily mean that you agree to it. Finally, the way they presented reality as something that simply exist in the mind and the past as something that can be altered was the main thing that captured me. I was so mindblown as I read about 'doublethink' and tampering of the past. The book made you question a lot of things about reality and the past. Was the past really some sort of a fixed event in space or did it vary? Was the reality were you existed even 'real?' Or is it merely a state created by your own mind?The real strength of the book was the depth at which it intellectually stimulates the readers. It made you question, reason, analyze. At moments, I found myself staring into the distance and wondering. Sure it was a gross and vile book, with the settings and ideas that it presented, but in its evil, you learn to appreciate it and the things that you now took for granted.It is indeed a must read! With its ironies and perverse ideas, you're sure to find yourself thinking an wondering."
765,Marlee,"I have long praised the Harry Potter series for its intricate details and back stories in its fictional world. This is the first book I have found since finishing Deathly Hallows three years ago that has done the same thing to such an extent. Not only was 1984 haunting and a tiny bit depressing, given its subject matter, but it was also phenomenally put together. Orwell's warning about communism is clear, but he was also able to construct a fascinating story about two people and their struggles, all around the framework of an extensive, extremely creative world. I was a bit fed up with Orwell after Animal Farm, wondering why he was praised as such a good writer, but this gem has restored my faith in him. My only complaints are these: the section given to relating The Book (a section that will be made clear to you if you read 1984) was a bit boring. A little too much information was given. The other problem I had was that Winston's terror of rats was never explained. But these are minor issues, certainly not enough to mar this thrilling story in any way. Recommend for 14+ for difficult subject matter and some innuendo. "
766,Ben," There are classic books that one reads simply to see what all of the fuss is about, and are soon forgotten in the midst of busy lives--this book is not of this kind.On the contrary, this masterpiece is as horrific as it is brilliant, and is sure to leave one engaged in deep contemplation long after completion. After reading 1984, I envision myself staring at my own reflection in a mirror, and choking with repulsion as I witness my own tortured and emaciated form, devoid of any discernible humanity: ""If you are human, that is humanity,"" I hear O'brien say over and over. Far from being simply a seething satire of Stalinism and the rise of the USSR, Orwell's 1984 depicts an age wherein humans lose the capacity to think critically, rendering them immune to truth in any other form than the general consensus of the Party; a Party that only publicly glorifies its motives on the surface, (by proclaiming that the present system is much better than the past) but is brutally honest in the confines of the Ministry of Love, claiming that power is the ends and not the means--that humans are destined to be ruled by an all-encompassing ideology of the infallible nature of the structure of Governance, (the Party) and, if non-compliant, systematically tortured until free will is wholly eradicated. This is a book to be read and re-read, especially in an age where consumption and entertainment are overshadowing the necessity of rational thought and wisdom.(less) "
767,Eva,Mind-boggling! A book the likes of which I've never read before.
768,Shawn Michael,"One of the best, thought provoking, prophetic novels I have ever read.One that I will surely revisit again. It's scary to think this book was written in 1948, and in 2015 we see some ideas from this book happening as normal day to day activities. Like Facebooking everything you're thinking, abbreviations of words in written conversation, emoticons, Television to keep the masses stupid, pointless wars fought for no reason other than ""they're the bad guys, let's kill them"", people having the need to buy new phones every year just because everyone else does it, having no friends or partner because you're only thinking about your job that you do to make others rich, goverment controlling everything even the food you eat, people living on wellfare better than workers without doing a thing, etc.If you're dead tired about anything and/or everything mentioned above, George Orwell was sick of it since 1948.Go read this book, dont vote, f@ck the system, down with big brother."

771,Shashank,"I must say that George Orwell is a genius.Politically,to devise a world of apparent opression wherein the upper class rule eternally,assisted by the system of INGSOC and with Newspeak as a language,the utter poverty of everything is extremely despicable but on one level - very impressive.Totalitarian rule and perpetuating it throughout a sustained period of time entailing use of three principles which all focus on the use of doublethink is jaw dropping and making anything of remote pleasure such as food and sex as intolerable is a credit to Orwell's creativity and vision.As the book devolves,O'brien,Julia and Winston provide the perfect backdrop on which Orwell can expound his imaginary world of repression and mental subjugation.Breakup of the classes and the departments and use of thought police,as well as how the party contiues altering the past to ensure the future and present signified by ""He who controls the present, controls the past. He who controls the past, controls the future"",further adds to what seems to be an inescapable world of pain,hunger and children denouncing their parents.The ending,just like most of Orwell's books is not one which is of happiness,but his style of writing and the socialistic society which he created to replace the capitalistic one is brilliantly portrayed for 50 pages,which for me was the best read in the book.All in all,a categorically brilliant political book which gives a view into how a world devoid of freedom and beliefs would operate and how ""WAR IS PEACE"" is what this book is all about."

773,Ahmad Alahmadi,كرواية وحبكة، تعيس وممل في أغلبه .. أما كقيمة تحصل عليها بعد إنتهاء الكتاب فهي عالية جداً .. وأعتقد إن لم تخنّي الذاكرة إني قرأت في مكانِ ما أن جورج أوريل صرّح مرة إنه ليس براوي وإنما كاتب مقال سياسي لفترة طويلة قبل أن يكتب روايته هذه لإيصال فكرته لشريحة أكبر ليس إلا.. وسواء قال هذا أم لا، شخصياً أرى أن فكرة الرواية من الممكن أن تُختصر في ٣٠ إلى ٥٠ صفحة على الأكثر إن لم يكن أقل من ذلك بكثير.. الحبكة مملة جداً، تجاوزتُ أكثر من منتصف الرواية ولا يوجد أي شيء ذي قيمة ولا حتى متعة تُذكر تعوّض هذا الملل .. بدأت الأحداث أو لنقل قيمة الرواية تماماً عندما مسك ونستون بكتاب غولدشتاين وبدأ يقرأ .. كانت صفحات كتاب غولدشتاين هي الفكرة التي أراد إيصالها الكاتب وما بعدها من أحداث داخل السجن.. أمّا أي شيء قبل ذلك كان تصوير للواقع الذي يعتقده الكاتب بناء على تنبئاته لما سيكون عليه حال العالم في ١٩٨٤ .. عادةً في الروايات الأخرى يستخدم الكاتب شخصيات الرواية والحبكة كاملة ليوصّل فكرته أو رسالته من خلالهم ، بحيث عند إنتهاء الرواية وبعد أن تجتمع جميع الخطوط تعرف مالذي أراد الكاتب إيصاله لك وسيعلق في ذاكرتك وغالباً لن تسناه.. أما هنا، الوضع مختلف قليلاً، تشعر أن الرواية تغرّد لحالها بدون أي قيمة تذكر، ثم يحشر فكرته في بضع صفحات من كتاب يقوم بطل الرواية بقرائته، أي أنه لم يستفد فعلاً من الرواية كناقل لفكرته، بحيث تثبّت آراءه في ذهن القارئ من خلال حبكة الرواية وشخصياتها، بل تجد نفسك أن كل ما تتذكره أو ترغب في تذكّره هو المعلومات التي قرأها بطل الرواية من الكتاب فقط لا غير والذي بدوره نص طويل وأفكار متسلسلة متواصلة يصعب إستعيابها وإسترجعها بدون أن تعود مرة أخرى لقراءتها أكثر من مرة..تقييمي للكتاب بسبب القيمة العالية له، والآراء السياسية والتنبئات المدهشة التي تضمّنها هذا الكتاب والتي أغلبها يحدث فعلياً في عالم اليوم .. والعجيب أني اليوم قرأت خبر آخر من آخبار عمليات التجسس التي تقوم بها وكالة الأمن القومي الإمريكية، وتذكرت طبعاً شاشة الرصد في الرواية ، ويقول الخبر أنه من ١٤ سنة، أي منذ عام ٢٠٠١ قامت إمريكا بزرع فايروس تجسسي في كل الأقراص الصلبة من أشهر الشركات المصنعة لها في أكثر من ١٥ دولة أعتقد .. أي أنه كل الأجهزة المحمولة والمكتبية منذ ٢٠٠١ والتي تستخدم الأقراص الصلبة من الشركات المشهور مثل ويسترن ديجيتال وسيقيت وغيرها هي أجهزة مكشوفة لدى وكالة الأمن القومي الإمريكية وتستطيع بناء على ذلك تصفّح الملفات المخزنة على تلك الأجهزة ونقلها والتحكم بها ومعرفة ما يدور فيها ذهن مستخدمين وسكّان هذه الدول .. الكتاب بصفة عامة قيّم، وتكاد تتطابق تنبئاته مع ما يحدث في عالم اليوم السياسي القذر.. وإضافة جميلة في وعيي السياسي بل هو إجابة شافية تفك شفرة أسئلة كثيرة كانت قد مرّت وما زالت تمر عليك أثناء رؤيتك للأوضاع السياسية المتردّية حول العالم ..

776,Julián,"Sin palabras... esto es más que un libro, es algo que se te mete en la piel al leerlo. Me dejó un poco traumado, como un poco asustado, desequilibrado, mareado, perdido... No se si lo voy a volver a leer alguna vez, es demasiado profunda esta obra, me cambió los ojos con los que veo a la realidad. En serio. En algunas partes me asusté; como Orwell logra doblegarte el espíritu con sus escritos es digno de no creer, es escalofriante.Nunca había leido un libro TAN intenso, y ojalá que llegue a leer otro igual, o que se le acerque por lo menos.pd: Léase bajo su propio riesgo, te puede cambiar la mente en serio.""Usted cree que la realidad es algo objetivo, substancial, con vida propia y derechos también propios. Y cree también que la naturaleza de lo real se revela por sí mismo. Cuando se engaña a si propio creyendo haber visto algo, supone que todos los demás lo ven del mismo modo. Pero yo le digo a usted, Winston, que la realidad carece de existencia corpórea. La realidad no existe sino en el entendimiento humano y nada más que allí; pero no el entendimiento individual, falible y perecedero, sino en el del Partido, en un entendimiento colectivo y, por lo tanto, inmortal. Lo que el Partido afirma, eso es la veradad. No es posible advertir la realidad sino examiándola a traés del Partido. Esa es la enseñanza que usted tiene que asimilar, Winston"".Nada había que no pudiera ser la verdad absoluta. Las llamadas leyes de la naturaleza no pasaban a ser sandeces y la ley de la gravedad, otro disparate. ""Si me propusiera -dijo O'Brien- podría elevarme en el aire como una pompa de jabón"". Reflexionó Winston: ""Si él cree poder elevarse en el aire y, al mismo tiempo, yo creo haberle visto hacerlo, entonces el fenómeno es perfectamente posible"".... "

778,Evan Garcia,"This novel is a heart wrenching story that includes power, control, love, romance, and betrayal. Winston is a lonely man living in London in 1984 under a totalitarian regime. He begins writing in a journal, which is illegal. Winston longs for friends which manifests itself in his desire for Julia. Winston’s life takes a turn when Julia slips him a note telling him that she loves them, and this is where the romance begins. The two begin a secret affair, which is against the law. Their affair makes the novel interesting because it shows Winston’s willingness to go against the government for love. Then, Winston gains the courage to openly rebel, and he and Julia go to O’Brian who they suspect is a rebel too. At that moment, the Thought Police break in and take him and Julia to the Ministry of Love to be tortured. Finally, the novel ends with the government completely breaking Winston down, which destroys his relationship with Julia forever. The ending shows the struggle between people’s free will and the will of others and how that struggle affects the relationships in their lives."
779,Cynthia E. Mulrooney,"Dispute the date on the cover, this book (still) depicts a possible future if we GIVE away OUR RIGHTS by NOT VOTING and not paying attention to the things our LEADERS are doing while we just blithely go about our lives!!!! It is a dark, frightening look at what is coming. When I read this in high school, (1960's) the idea of cameras everywhere was ludicrous.....almost 50 years later; look a around!!! We also now use tiny aircraft to spy. READ THIS BOOK--IT WILL SCARE YOU. This is a classic which still should be read. "
780,Christopher Lock,"Can one use political language without having read this book? I doubt it. It's like The Bible, if you haven't investigated it somewhat, you won't know what everyone keeps referring to."
781,Rohit,"I am not much into writing reviews for books, but '1984' forces one to. This is perhaps the only instance where I saw the movie adaptation first, and read the book thereafter (partly because I received it as a gift). And it turned out to be a very wise decision indeed.Set in a world where the government has the power to control every aspect of its citizens' lives, '1984' impeccably portrays the fear and the desperation the protagonist, Winston Smith, goes through. It does not depict scenes of gruesome torture (not till the last third of the book at least), or inhuman living conditions. Rather, it portrays how the government continuously monitors its citizens' daily routines, constantly changes the recorded history, and erases the identities of people it wishes to. The fear of losing one's identity completely, as if one never existed, can instill fear in the strongest of hearts.The defining moment of the story comes when Winston, incarcerated because of his part in the revolution, finally 'betrays' his lover Julia, and realizes that he has lost all his love for her, as he shouts out ""Do it to her!"". Its worth one's time to read the book just for the sake of this one scene."
782,Pedro Barrento,"There are four stages, regarding the rules of writing (can be extended to rules in other areas):1) you don't obey the rules and your book is lousy2) you obey the rules but your book is still lousy3) you obey the rules and you write a quality book4) you don't obey the rules and you write a quality bookLevel three is rare enough, level four is something you find a handful of times during your lifetime: 1984, by George Orwell, is a level four book.It is even more noteworthy because the few ""level four"" examples I know of are by authors who broke structural rules, or rules that concern POV or character traits. But 1984 is the only book I know of that breaks the ""show not tell"" rule and gets away with it.To be honest, it feels a bit odd at times, because the author spends most of the book telling, instead of showing, which is a sure-fire way of ruining any book, but he somehow manages to make it acceptable.There are some passages where it doesn't work, the most extreme example being the ""Goldstein book"" excerpts which should have been edited to, at least, one third of their present size and are extremely boring and repetitive. But apart from that, most of the book is very enjoyable. Its mix of quality in the detail of the writing and frontal violation of the rules of quality in general terms makes for a unique text which in the end is probably the ideal vehicle for the message of the story – both the style and the content make the reader cringe like chalkboard screech.As for the story itself, I repeat what I've already said when reviewing ""Animal Farm"": this is a fiercely anti-Stalinist book written by someone with impeccable left-wing credentials (Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side), which both adds to the fun of it and most certainly to the legitimacy."

I'd waffle at length about this novel's brilliant insights and wry observations, but it's been said before and better. So simply, here are my very favorite bites, savored for both taste and texture.The horrible thing about the two minutes hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary.Winston was gelatinous with fatigue.Crimestop, in short, means protective stupidity. But stupidity is not enough.But I tell you Winston, that reality is not external. Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes; Two and two are four.Sometimes Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once. You must try harder. It is not easier to become sane.You are a difficult case. But don’t give up hope. Everyone is cured sooner or later. In the end we shall shoot you. "
787,Juliet Davis,"If before you read 1984 you never saw how government intrudes in our daily lives and how things are so easily controlled, you will after reading it. Orwell's Dystopian classic lays out how easily we, the masses can so easily be deceived by political rhetoric, mind control and constant fear and brutality. How we can be misled to think the wrong thing is the right thing... and how we could be made to feel grateful for it. After reading this book, I can't look at our world the same ever again. So many shades of 1984 are apparent in everyday life and everything we do, political bills that have been passed, an economy spiralling out of control. You have to remind yourself that 1984 was written way back in 1949! It is a frightening prophecy of a world that is only a mere nudge from becoming our own. 1984 is a warning of letting anyone have too much control. Of how through deception, freedom is made into slavery without us even knowing the difference. If you ever thought that there was something wrong with our world, that their was something more than what we can see or hear going on, read this book, it's simply amazing. But beware, once you see 1984 through Orwell's eyes, you may never see our own world ever the same through your own eyes. You will be awakened, and may never go back to sleep."
788,Leo Hsieh,"I really enjoyed reading 1984, I gave it a 5 star because it was filled with suspense, very strong characterizations and a excellent atmosphere that George Orwell have created with his great choice of words. 1984 is also very unique in it's own way and it's very original which no other author can write another book similar to 1984. I learned a lot from this book such as the lose if identity and uniqueness in a society, the idea of altering mental memories by forcing extreme physical agony in order to easily govern the population. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction but some of it's contents may not be suitable for kids or students with it's graphical and violent content. The main reason I actually like this book is because of it's connection to the real world, even though Orwell write the book a long time ago we can still see it in the present, such as Hitler, Soviets, the Islamic state, Al qaeda, Boko Hakam they are all evidence of government to hide some parts of information to create fear into the population to assert total control over the society.

791,ThomyZ,"There is a very select group of books that I decided to read again before submitting a rating on the site. Nineteen Eighty-Four is one of them. The last time I read it was many years ago, and I was uncertain if it would still have the same profound impact on me that it had when I was a teenager.As a matter of fact, it does. It is still one of the most powerful dystopias I know, especially because of the way it revolves around the views and experiences of one individual character. Its strong and lasting message comes as much from the way it is written as it does from the content itself.It is not an easy book to read; much of it is dark and depressing and pessimistic, but to me, that aspect of it is what has made it so memorable, what made it shape part of my thinking in a way that few works of fiction can. I will continue to cherish it and will read it again years from now."

793,Bijan,"The late Christopher Hitchens once said (and I am paraphrasing): ""When you see North Korea it is almost as if someone tried to do an experiment to see if the world in 1984 can be built in the real world.""When I was reading the book I could not help comparing what I read with the reality around myself. Needless to say there is an exaggeration in the novel but the principles are the same in every totalitarian regime. The control of the media, the alteration of the past and history, the indoctrination of people and specially children, the deliberate degradation of the masses, and even DOUBLETHINK among many other ideas in the novel is being used to some extent in all totalitarian regimes as if 1984 is the handbook for building a dark dreadful autocratic government that seeks nothing but pure power.From the first pages of the novel I had a feeling that the this story is not going to end happily. As a matter of fact I was right. But I hope for all the people suffering from living in such conditions, it ends well. "
794,Huma,"I must say, I surely didn't expect this; I had a completely different idea as to what I'd be getting out of this novel - a happy ending, perhaps, or even a lesson about revolutionaries and their revolts - and it was a shocking surprise (definitely in a good, yet awe-struck, sense). What I felt through the first third of the book was patient curiosity about such a gray world and the certain absurdity of such a world actually existing, the second third waiting for some sort of excitement in order to awaken the dazed & brain-washed population and, at the same time, admiring the creative genius of the author to go to such lengths as to make us readers vividly imagine the aspects of such a dreary, somewhat-realistic world using such a language (in that day and age!), building it by scratch, and the third (and last) part of the book just conformed me to such a dark mood which is unimaginable yet believable.It's truly a horrifying book which tests anyone's mental state and stability. What's amazing is that: it isn't impossible to achieve. Moreover, it could be happening right now and we're completely unaware and oblivious. Such a chilling prospect of proportions!"
795,Giulia Campana,"""Chi controlla il passato controlla il futuro. Chi controlla il presente controlla il passato.""Quando ho letto la prima volta 1984 non ne ho capito il senso. Ero troppo piccola, e -non so se fortunatamente o sfortunatamente- troppo ingenua per poter comprendere il mondo che si nascondeva dietro quelle quattro cifre. 1984 è una data, che potrebbe essere qualsiasi anno. La sua estrema facoltà nell'essere attuale in tutte le epoche è uno dei punti di forza del libro. Di certo non per l'umanità.George Orwell, in quest'opera, spaventa, proprio per questa sua profonda - forse non voluta- continua attualità. E proprio per questo reputo ""1984"" un obbligo letterario. Uno di quei libri che andrebbe letto in tutte le scuole, quando si ha l'età giusta per capirne ogni sfaccettatura. E per cercare, infine, di farlo diventare finalmente un libro del passato. "
796,Monika B,"I mostly read YA and I feel like I know a lot about YA fiction. YA is like familiar territory, like home, while books like 1984 are new, unexplored territory. I didn't know what to expect and I didn't think I would be able to finish it. But I've wanted to read this and other books by George Orwell for the longest time and so I finally did. And I loved it. And as soon as I'd read the last page, I wanted to start it all over again.Dystopian books are meant to show us what our world or government is heading towards. At the same time, they're written in a way that you can see parallels between the horrible, imaginary world described in the book and the real world.“Big Brother is Watching You.” George Orwell describes a society, in which nothing you do or say or even think is private, in which even having negative thoughts about the Party is illegal. The Party wants mindless followers, wants them to be so incapable of thought that they never realise how oppressed they truly are. The Party does this by controlling everything you do. Everything from what time you exercise to whom you marry is decided and approved by the Party. “Orthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.” To make sure there's no rebellion, they have to destroy your ability to think, they have to destroy your individuality. In this world, there's no art or literature, or even science. They have a new language called ""newspeak"" that doesn't even have the word ""science"" in it. There is a section of the Party dedicated to making the newspeak vocabulary smaller every year. Because if you don't have the right words at your disposal, how would you express your thoughts? How would you even be able to think?""Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.""There's no religion, either. The Party wants you to worship, revere and love Big Brother like you would a god. They go so far as to make sure everything the Big Brother or the Party ever says or predicts is correct by rewriting past records and destroying them. Winston's job is to fabricate such records. He knows every historical is text is inaccurate and that every record has been rewritten, so he's been doubting everything around him and worrying about the truth. He meets and falls in love with Julia, who in his own words is a ""rebel from the waist down"". She doesn't care so much about the truth or freedom, but she does hate the Party and all it's rules. The only rules she's concerned with breaking, though, are the ones that stop her from getting what she wants. She is the final push Winston needs to actively rebel against the Party. Together they join ""The Brotherhood"" which is a group working against the Party. But is ""The Brotherhood"" even real?“Until they became conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.” The book is brilliantly written and is really believable. The future Orwell describes is recognizable, it was relevant in 1948, when this book was released, and it is relevant now. It's a book that you'll be thinking about for weeks after having finished it."
797,Walter,"This book was on sale a few weeks back, so I picked it up and decided it was high time I read it. It's one of the best books I've ever read.WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.Every Orwell book has that saying that basically shoves the book along (Four legs good, two legs bad!), but this one just glues itself to your brain. Today's dystopian fiction basically sits at the knees of this book and begs for a scrap of its greatness . Seriously.Without giving too much away, this book is about a man named Winston, who tries to revolt against the government in a world where you are constantly being watched. It's a terrifying story and as the book progresses you're going to see just how much is scares the pants off you.I'm not going to go into much detail here because the book pretty much nails it in every single category straight across the board. There is, however, one quote I think you should read because it really does sum up the book very very well.""Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you. Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty and then we shall fill you with ourselves.""It's epic. 'Nuff said."
798,Tristan,"I waited till I was mature enough to read a book of this complexity. Most of my favorite authors quoted this book many times. I read ""Animal Farm"" just before ""1984"" Which showed me the perspective with which our lives are guided in the lies we are told and the lies we ask for to keep us sane. The way we rationalize the limited choices our ability of transduction let's us acknowledge for if you truly saw who you are, the knowledge alone would burn the sanity from you're face and touch. ""social dysmorphic disorder"" is our shield. Our horse blanket, the flower we yearn for when there no longer there. Directly after I picked up ""1984"" That one. That book, made me see that no matter how close and full our lives become we will forever be alone in our minds and our hearts. Accepting is not part of the human condition, we might as well just stop If we stop dreaming, stop hoping, stop fighting. Its insanity of the human condition to be in perpetual conscious dissonance. Life has no reason to question itself,only death has a reason and or right too.“Winston Smith: Does Big Brother exist?O'Brien: Of course he exists.Winston Smith: Does he exist like you or me?O'Brien: You do not exist. ” ― George Orwell That quote, is what I will never accept. I will fight the sad fact I know it's true sometimes. but not all the. and that's all that matters. 2012Sent from my Telstra Next G device"
799,João Morais,"Nunca um livro me tinha apresentado um plot-twist tão imprevisível e repentino. Isso, aliado a uma história espectacular e uma descrição incrível de uma sociedade tenebrosa fazem com que ""Mil Novecentos e Oitenta e Quatro"" seja um daqueles livros obrigatórios."
800,Jean-claude Boulos,"Words can't describe how I feel about this book. It has always been a favourite even before I've read it but when I finally picked it up and read it entirely, I'm even more in love with it. It's the dystopian community through the eyes of a certain Winston Smith: a community that would teach you to love, hate and blame yourself on why you exist.No love is in the air.Sex is not sensual but only a reproduction for the Party.You don't exist, you never have; you are just a sub-division of the Party, born to continue.All I can say, is that this book should be read by everyone because it is a portrayal of what would happen if man became too integrated into society as to become only a cog in the hour.Freedom is Slavery.War is Peace.Ignorance is Strength.2+2=5"

803,Jennifer Varela,"1984 by George Orwell has to be the creepiest most horrifying book I’ve ever read because it’s hauntingly...real. It’s obviously a fiction book but the things it talks about make me think that this is what our world will be like in a few years. 1984 was 3 decades ago but this story and theory (if you will) continue to live on. In this book, everything you read is monitored by the government. By everything I mean eating, sleeping, working, thinking, etc. Whether you’re being obedient or rejecting the government, they find out. Even your children can go and report you to the authorities because in this world, government is number 1. It’s absolutely insane how in this book individualism is a crime and it seems that this is what’s starting to happen in our world today. You can’t be yourself without someone having to say something negative or judge your emotions, thoughts, and beliefs. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to get creeped out by Orwell’s creativity and unintentional accurate predictions. "
804,Līva,"I'm sure it's been said a million times already, but it is actually frightening how topical this book still is. There is only one thing that I had a major problem with: ""Suddenly, as one sometimes does with a book of which one knows that one will ultimately read and re-read every word, he opened it at a different place and found himself at Chapter III."" I have NEVER done that and never plan to. That's a really strange way to read a book, in my honest opinion. "
805,Paritosh Anand,"""Who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past"".Not many of you might know that famous television shows ‘The Big Brother’ and its Indian version ‘Big Boss’ are vaguely conceptualized on the theme of this novel. There are two ways you can read 1984-First, to read it word by word as a spectator to the novel or second, to live it through the eyes of the narrator, Winston Smith. George Orwell’s 1984 is a gripping satire, a warning for human society and sheer storytelling brilliance. If Nazis' history has shades of barbarism,then the extreme nature of totalitarian regime can be absolutely chilling.1984 is all about imagining existence of such a world .(Spoiler alert for this paragraph; not much revealed though)A mystical figure, ‘The Big Brother’ is believed to be keeping track of each of your activity. The past is mutable. A totalitarian party exists, which can choose to rewrite the history the way it wants. The history, to put in simple words, has been arrested. Any sort of evidence that might prove the party weak is altered, and any wrong prediction altered. A thought rebellion is criminal and it is caught by the telescreen that watches you all the time.People are vaporized from society not for committing any crime, but based on their eccentric thought process which might have made them to commit a crime against the party in future. They don’t die, they will never have existed.. The party believes that killing people in the open will glorify the victim and shame them. So, they don't punish the heretic overtly but annihilate them from all records of past and future. The system is moulded to safeguard the infallibility of the party. War is a continuous process yet people are indifferent to it. “In the eyes of the party there were no distinctions between the thought and the deed”.In such savage conditions, what happens to a man called Winston Smith, who nurtures a thoughtcrime: a rebellion against Party in his own mind by falling in love, is central to the story.The lines""Under the spreading chestnut treeI sold you and you sold me—""are somehow gut-wrenching and apt.George Orwell as a storywriter engrosses you throughout with his lucid and thought-provoking story astonishingly written in 1949 with a foresight of the world in 1984.Thoughtcrime, doublethink, crimestop, newspeak, the thought police-Orwell’s jargons force us to think of the relevancy of his vision in some subtle ways. It’s not only engrossing, but at times frightening when you imagine your own existence in such a world!This is a must-read book and I have no qualms on why it is rated as one of the best books ever written.

806,Reham Kareem,"تتحدّث الرواية باختصار عن حياة وينستون سميث, مواطنٌ من دولة أوقيانيا (و هي دولة شمولية كبرى من ضمن ثلاث دول تتقاسم العالم عام 1984 حسب الكاتب) يعيش في لندن و يعمل موظفاً في وزارة الحقيقة, إحدى الوزارات الأربع التي تشكّل حكومة الحزب الأوحد, حزب الإنغ سوك أو الاشتراكي الإنكليزي, و تقود الحزب و الدولة شخصية غامضة تدعى ""الأخ الأكبر"".وكان شعار الحزبالحرب هي السلامالحرية هي العبوديهالجهل هو القوةيسيطر الأخ الأكبر على جميع تفاصيل حياة سكان أوقيانيا الذين يعيشون تحت المراقبة المستمرة طيلة حياتهم, و يتحكّم بمشاعرهم و يلغي أغلبها مع إبقاء الغضب و الكراهية و الشك بالذات و بالآخرين.في هذه الروايه تصور شامل للحياة في دولة اشتراكية شيوعية طغت على العالم ووصلت إلى لندن وبدأت ببمارسة تشويه الفكر واستعباد عقول الملايين فكريا وثقافيا ومادياً. الأخ الكبير هو قائد الثورة ورمز السلطة والدولة وباسمه يدعو سكان دولة أوقيانا كل صباح وكل مساء. ونستون هو الموظف في وزارة الحقيقة والذي مهمته أن يعيد كتابة التاريخ بطريقة لا تضر بصورة الحزب وبصورة الأخ الكبير. وقد صار ونستون يفكر في أن هذا العالم زيف، ويحاول أن يفهم كيف يستطيع العيش كل من حوله دون أن يعترفوا بهذا الزيف اليومي. أما أوبراين فهو من أعضاء الحزب الداخلي وقائد في وزارة الحب، التي مهمتها أن تجعل جميع الناس تحب الأخ الكبير بشتى الوسائل، حتى القتل والتعذيب، وتعهد باخفاء ذلك إلى وزارة الحقيقة.ليست روايه عاديه بل احدى التحف الادبيه والتي يجب قرائتها من الجدير بالذكرأ بان هذه الروايه تم منعها في الكثير من الدول الواقعة تحت القبضة الاستبدادية الشمولية مثل الاتحاد السوفييتي السابق و دول المنظومة الاشتراكية السابقة و الصين و كوريا الشمالية و كوبا و بعض الدول في أفريقيا و أميركا اللاتينية.لا ادري كيف جورج اورويل يجعل قارئه متعجرفه مثلي ان تقرأ كتابه من غير ان يصيبها الملل وتقيمه ب 5 نجوم من غير تردد !القرائه الثانيه له بعد روايه مزرعةالحيوان وبالتأكيد لن تكون الاخيرة"
807,Livv Coy,"I had to read this book for my grade 11 English class but my love for this novel is almost indescribable. Winston is such a powerful and influential character throughout the novel. The way he survives in such an unjust society just simply amazes me. I do not know how I would have lived being under the eyes of ""Big Brother."" The concept of Newspeak really fascinated me; it was interesting how making language more simple actually manipulates a population. I also loved the character Julia because she is such a powerful woman in her society. Her feminist views really sold me on this novel. O'Brien was a confusing character for me. I don't want to spoil anything but once you get to part three of the novel you'll know what I mean. Such an amazing classic that I recommend everyone reads at some point in their life. I would like to read ANIMAL FARM by George Orwell as well."
808,Natalia,"I read this book (I refrain myself real hard from not saying ""masterpiece"" every time because it is) for the first time a few years ago, in my first or second year of college. I loved it back then, and meant to reread it at some point, but remembering just how depressing it is, I didn't dare.I finally got enough motivation when it came out in Ukrainian for the first time - a welcome, if much overdue, addition to my collection. This is something everyone in Ukraine should read, study and remember, because it gives a much bigger insight into the enemy's mind.The book, already great in itself, contains a lot of informative commentary in footnotes by the translator and the publishing team, and in the afterword, a Ukrainian writer not just analyzes the novel, but also provides examples of the phenomena described there that we find in everyday life. You may feel, he says, that doublethink is too much and clearly an unrealistic exaggeration, but here - this is how it works right now. I'm in love with 1984. If I didn't have a huge to-read list, I might've started rereading it right after I finished it."
809,Maha,"""فالكتاب لا يمكن أن يفنى، فحتى إذا ما أتلفت النسخة الأخيرة منه فإن في وسعنا أن نعيد كتابته حرفاً حرفاً"""
810,Francy Cabrera-Paz, This book is SO dense! It took me a couple days to make it through the first pages. This is one of the few books that take me a while to sink in.
811,Dorothy,"Can't believe I waited so long to read this classic. I totally loved it, and it surprised me, because I wasn't expecting so much of the writing to be so richly sensuous. Now I want to read Orwell's essays."
812,Leftjab,"Another justified classic. Still retains its power - I admit this is one I should have read years ago but never did. Reading now, it's interesting how it feels like a diatribe against totalitarianism - as if Orwell was brutally saying ""is this how you want the world to be?"" Directed at dictators like Stalin, who had corrupted Orwell's idea of socialism with prison camps and torture.Early into the book Orwell/Winston asks ""How could you communicate with the future?"" Of course, the simple read of the book is to see how much of the book is ""prophecy,"" though I don't think that was Orwell's intention at all - of course, if our 1984 (or 1999, or 2013 for that matter) resembled his Oceania, I think he would probably cry. My reading of it (and many others) coincided with the recent ""shock"" about Edward Snowden and the NSA, though I wasn't surprised at all by that, and felt that the politicians who were were employing a form of ""doublespeak"" - but wait a second, don't our politicians on both sides of the political spectrum employ ""doublespeak?"" I seem to recall several egregious instances of primarily right-wing politicians deliberately contradicting themselves on multiple occasions in the media. Weapons of mass destruction anyone? And then of course the right would say that the leftist media controls what is ""fit to print,"" so maybe we shouldn't listen to either side, and just watch reality television, which is where people are filmed all the time, their privacy willingly sacrificed for attention and monetary gain...I guess that was the increase in 1984's sales for that week (but who actually read it?) - in my mind, the scary thing is how America has willingly sacrificed some of the freedoms Orwell was extolling in the book (privacy, expression, thought - there's an entire culture in America proud to be uneducated, unread), for the sake of convenience and consumerism. Posting on Facebook and Twittering and all of the social media is devoted to the elimination of the private spectrum - your digital self is exposed to the world - in thought and deed. (And as Orwell feared the simplification of language would lead to the inability to express oneself leading to another form of thought control by the state, how many people communicate today via texting? Is this not a form of newspeak? Orwell, as also stated in Pynchon's excellent into, feared for the world of his children - depicted in 1984 as willing accomplices to the Party. So our children, now brought up with social media and texting, will inherit a limited vocabulary and dumbed-down grammar. It is convenient to text though....) That our government was recently exposed to utilize phone records and digital footprints to track supposed terrorists - this didn't surprise me in the least. The passing of the Patriot Act in 2001 was a tip that our digital means of communication can be read by anyone - when you get your cell phone bill, it (at least it used to) contain every phone call you had made during a billing cycle - who would be surprised when those phone records would be read by the government? I'm sorry, the world of high level government (hell high level anything) is not fair or nice. That is the world we live in.The difference between the automatons of the Party and our conformist automatons in America is that we willingly are giving up our individuality and thought by dumbing down the populace - the resistance to education, culture, and activity is what is turning into America's legacy. When Winston looks at himself in the mirror after being in the Ministry of Love for who knows how long, he sees what is essentially a concentration camp survivor. Ironically, the American Party member would be overweight, his teeth falling out from sugary drinks.And while we're on that, it would seem to me that the right-wing's using of the word ""freedom"" in terms of gun rights and the more libertarian aspects of their ideology (I want my jumbo soda and no gov'ment is gonna tell me differnt!) seems to be yet another example of a powerful doublespeak: What is the freedom to be found in pointing a gun at another human? By eliminating one person's freedom we are expressing our own? Of course, then ""self-defense"" and ""security"" are thrown into the conversation which does admittedly complicate things. But there seems to be some sort of elimination of the relationship between the right's current ideology and what some would call objective reality, which I would describe as our inner selves relationship with the external world governed by what we define as physics. (Of course, since the right love to use their religiousness as a selling point, faith is belief without fact. I'm not going to get into the problems with the Christian right in America, but spirituality and religion are not the same thing. The usage of religious ideology to control and manipulate the populace ABSOLUTELY has a tinge of fascism to it. How can someone espouse that they believe in religious freedom when anyone who doesn't agree with their religious beliefs is condemned to hell? Scary stuff, that.)Again, this was meant to be a quick comment not an epic. One last thing - torture. The last 100 pages or so of 1984 still retain their power to shock. Electric shock therapy makes me queasy and Orwell's depiction of the true nature of totalitarian power still holds its own power. (In this respect, 1984 shares similarities with another anti-fascist screed: Pasolini's Salo. But the written word, while effective, still does not come close to the explicitness of film when it comes to depicting horror. Which is most likely why Salo is still one of the most unpleasant and upsetting films ever made. On a less explicit but no less disturbing level, the recent film Compliance definitely offers up some similar comments about the insidious nature of our current consumer culture and what it is doing to our populace.) This might be completely off-base, but since I'm a fan of horror films, finding the recent (but passed) fad of torture-porn (Saw, Hostel, Captivity, Martyrs, Frontiers, etc) has some parallels in an Orwellian world: If the directors find the need to push the limits of graphic violence by simply (and some might say gleefully) depicting the human body at the mercy of an unrelenting, unfeeling, inhuman torturer, this could metaphorically show that A. The crimes committed at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Gharib have seeped into the filmmakers' subconscious B. Barbaric torture in our world is accepted as a reality in terms of political enemies C. Filmmakers and audiences have made torture banal by depicting it as entertainment. Erich Fromm's excellent afterward made the point that after two world wars, multiple fascist dictators, and the atomic bomb, the hope for humanity that might have been born at the dawn of the 20th Century might have been swallowed by our destructive tendencies. Fascism and totalitarianism succeed amongst children and the uneducated because it caters to simplistic, base tendencies within our psyche. Orwell seemed terrified and upset that these tendencies would come to dominate our world in the future. Unfortunately, the redemption of our species that would seem to even hope that a utopia is possible somehow, seems to be dying as America devolves into ignorance, religious mania, and mental and physical laziness. (Idiocracy anyone?)I remember working on a commercial maybe ten years ago during the large Iraq war protests where there was an intense discussion with another production assistant about the rising sense of fascism in America. His act of rebellion was to send a copy of 1984 to every member of Congress. A friend of mine made the point that this was no act of rebellion - it would only make him feel better (non-conformist) about himself, since none of Congress would actually read the book. And maybe in a hundred years, they won't be able to read at all. "
813,Ghada Zain,Left me speechless and overwhelmed! 
814,mai,الخطاب الإيديولوجي الذي تم كتابة منذ عام ١٩٤٩ أصابني في مقتل ، القدرة الرائعة التى مكنت أورويل في تقديم رواية قائمة على منطق تسلسلي مستقبلي عن الدولة الشمولية والأسقاطات التى قرأتها أشعر إن الكثير منها تم تحقق منه وخاصة من صفحة ٢٤٤ إلى ٢٤٨ أستمتعت جداً بها واتمنى أن نقف عند تلك الصفحات وأن لانصل إلى مرحلة متقدمة من الرعب الذي يصيب أي قارئ عند قراءتها اخيراً الرواية تجعلك تصاب بالحزن والغضب والخوف ومشاعر عاطفية فلا تقلق فهذا من أساسيات حب الأخ الكبير
815,Cassandra Kay Silva,"This whole idea of doublethink consumed me. The ""mutability of the past"" as Orwell terms it. To be able to rewrite history has always been an inseparable part of the fact that it is history. But to determine the future by determining thoughts? To determine the past by what you want at the present? To so inoculate society as to have them believe or not believe what their eyes see as evident? Incredible! And this Character O'Brien. Who plays both the ultimate protector and simultaneously the antagonistic demon. How complex! How torridly interesting a role, I was so perplexed by circumstance and so overwhelmed by this O'Brien that at one point my mind opened and I saw that perhaps Goldstein was Big Brother, perhaps Big Brother was only a secondary mask behind the fabricated society in which it was all only a trial, yes they must be trying this character. O'Brien was trying him for some greater purpose there would be a better end... a better end? Indefensibly the ending was exactly as it should be and perfect although sickeningly so. What a brilliant piece of literature. The final chapters as the human mind is being broken down. As my own mind twisted into a myrid of thoughts and shapes. Rejecting, accepting, rejecting, accepting and finally loving? Loving? Inconceivable and yet absolute Ingsoc.Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past. Does this give anyone else a greater appreciation for the already epic genius of Rage Against the Machine? "
816,Rizwan,"Although there are flaws in the book, this definitely deserves a full 5 stars.The pioneer of all dystopian novels, Orwell's nightmarish world of the all-knowing and all-controlling Big Brother is a compelling read. And Orwell does not lack for ambition - dabbling in ethics, economics, political science, metaphysics and linguistics in tying up to form a believable world.His world is realistic because you can believe that an oppressed and conditioned people as such will behave this way. It is realistic because there have been echoes of such events in the past and the present.From Stalinist Russia to the Kim's North Korea, elements of Oceania and Ingsoc are no longer simply fiction. And it is not only openly totalitarian states that have encroached on human freedom. Haven't even democracies taken up unheard and secret liberties on our freedom and rights?1984. The ultimate police state. As a disenchanted party drone, Winston lives in constant fear that his subversive thoughts will be discovered by the Thought Police and he will be erased from the world. Yet as he finds love and engages in overt acts against the Party and Big Brother he suffers betrayal and the consequences he knew that were inevitable.One of the most frightening theme throughout the book, and what Winston quickly grasps is that by constantly rewriting history and making people forget the past, the Party does not leave any chance of discontent. There will never be a revolution.I started this because I was planning on reading The Giver and Divergent next in response to the movie adaptions that have come out/coming out. Truly to understand how terrible a book is, you really should start with the good."
817,Natalie Kaufman,"Okay so I was in honors language arts this school year and was assigned this book. I had heard many great things about it previously and my teacher had recommended many amazing books to me previously. I figured since she had assigned it to the whole class, it would be decent. It well surpassed my expectations greatly. The twisted ideas of Orwellian society got me thinking deeply about similar aspects of today's lifestyle. And May the memories of Winston and Julia reign supreme! (Yes, I read this in 8th grade language.. No lie.) This is an awesome read and has an interesting plot. One of my favorites of late."
818,Mark Doswald,That was by far the most disturbing book I have ever read. I don't think I will be able to ever forget it. A very..... VERY chilling book about what humans are capable of. Wow...
819,Ho Christopher,"1984 is very well written, the first few chapters reads very much like a modern day North Korea account. It's hard to believe that this was actually written more than 60 years ago! I wonder how Orwell himself would have been astonished at how accurate a picture he is able to paint about the communist regime.There is very good flow in the text, the book gives a very good feel as you read it, it is not too fast-paced for you to want to take a break while reading, neither is it too slow paced that makes you want to give up reading the book. The book is split into 3 big blocks, each taking almost equal portion of the book, which is a good accomplishment, Orwell does not, like many contemporary authors rush through the ending giving a huge sense of dissatisfaction as you draw to a close.The first part deals with the relative joy and dissatisfaction of Winston, the main character of the story, and his romance with Julia.The second part mainly deals with his imprisonment and betrayal. (Sorry this is really a short statement on a big block, but to go anymore will spoil the whole story. Read it yourself!)The third part deals with his re-education and re-assimilation back into his society.Highly recommended for those who are interested in North Korean or communist life, or any history major who just wants to have a vivd picture of life under the communist regime.Ratings: 5/5"
820,John Parr,"I was fortunate enough to be entering high school in 1984, so 1984 (the book) found its way onto a lot of reading lists. Reading 1984 heavily influenced my thinking and reading preferences. It's directly responsible for my fascination with utopian and dystopian literature, which was in turn partly responsible for me studying English in college."
821,Olivia B,"1984By George Orwell1984 is a vision of the future set in a dystopian society ruled by a powerful leader with the intent to control and manipulate the population in a manner that attempts to eliminate, individual expression and will. The story introduces the main character Winston Smith, a middle aged man who works at an organization called The Ministry of Truth. His job is to recreate any photo or document containing any facts that counter what is presented as the standard and established “reality,” of the ruling government body. Winston is one of the few people of his society who questions the rules and norms he is told to live by. He is a rebel that attempts to resist the status quo, except this has to remain a secret, as a matter of life and death; for those who do not conform, are seen as a threat and are eliminated from the society. Later, Winston meets a girl named Julia from his work, who he falls in love with and shares in his “rebellious” thinking of the higher power which rules their world. The combination of these events that unfold with Julia and his defiant thinking, lands Winston and Julia in serious trouble. Winston has to face the higher powers that be and struggles to keep his identity. This narrative conveys that when humans forget their true nature, are denied the ability to feel and question authority, and threatened by institutional power that determines the conditions of their lives, it is possible to forget what it means to be human. This novel still serves as one of the best classic forms of a “negative utopia,” whose purpose is to warn its readers of the potential of governments and established institutions of power that can overtake the direction and purposes of people’s lives. The frightening reality of a “Big Brother,” that influences media, political systems, commerce, and even daily life and social relationships, could prevail if humans become too passive about their roles and obligations to a society. What is accepted as order and compliance, as loyalty to the whole of a society, and what is seen as a personal choice of an individual, has been a matter of important debate for all societies. Although the year 1984 is in the past, many of the ideas in the book are still relevant today and continue to influence social and governing policies in modern society and lives. I think everybody can relate to the feelings of control, manipulation, and sometimes by our government and media which Winston experiences throughout the book. Even today, our privacy is violated and governments create intrusive policies, supposedly intended to keep their citizens safe. I would definitely recommend this book and think everyone should read this book at least once in their life. If you like reading fiction and history or have liked other works by George Orwell, you will enjoy this great book. "
822,Louise Colclough,"Possibly the greatest book ever written...I loved every word, in every sentence of every paragraph. The scariest dystopian book I have ever read, due to how relevant it is to today's society. If are are not careful a lot of what goes on in this twisted futuristic reality could possibly come to fruition.Truly mesmerising and impossible to put down! "
823,Isabel,"P. 31 - ""Sempre aqueles olhos a fitar-nos e aquela voz a envolver-nos. Na vigília ou no sono, a trabalhar ou a comer, em casa ou na rua, no banho ou na cama - não havia fuga possível. Nada nos pertencia, excepto os poucos centímetros cúbicos dentro da nossa cabeça."""
824,Tosh,"It's interesting, right now I am in London, and I think about this book a lot. Due to the fact that there are cameras everywhere in the Capital. Also a lot of signs saying in nature that 'you are being photographed for your own safety.' It doesn't set me off on london, but it's a city that is for sure in love with security. also there are notices to always beware, to be alert, and don't hesitate to turn in any information if you see anything strange, etc.And a lot of the stores here have notices saying be careful with your mobile phone because there are thieves in the area or store. And for sure London has been hit with terrorist attacks, like forever. But it's interesting how this security situation is taken in stride by the London citizen. London is a great city and always changing. And this is one change I noticed since I last been here - which is a couple of years ago. Anyway ""1984"" is a great book."
825,Leslie," 1984, by George Orwell is about a totalitarian society driven by fear. The citizens of the society are forced to follow a simple slogan of “War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength,” which is represented mainly by the invented character of Big Brother. Anyone who objects or expresses rebellious ideas would be captured by the thought police and vaporized. The main character in this novel is Winston Smith, an official that works for the Ministry of Truth. His desire in the novel is to be rebellious and become part of the secret organization, The Brotherhood. A diary is kept by him to express his rebellious thoughts and to supposedly communicate with O’Brien, someone who he thinks is associated with The Brotherhood. O’Brien eventually invites him to join The Brotherhood, and is eventually betrayed by him to be captured by the Thought Police.- No one can be trusted in a totalitarian society like Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany, or in this case, Oceania. Winston seemed to be the light shining down at the dusty and dead civilization of Oceania. His desire to know his past and prove that the society was all a lie gave the impression that he was the savior of the society. But every hero has his tragic flaw and Winston’s was being to trusting. It first began with Julia, someone who he has an affair with, and when he had made a lasting relationship with her, he began to lower his guard down and was manipulated into believing that there was a rebellious movement. His rebellious desire eventually took over and was easily convinced that The Brotherhood was indeed real. The idea of the thought police was always watching everyone faded and he expressed his ideas openly instead of writing in his diary and keeping to himself. He believed to be fighting Big Brother with an army, but eventually he was convinced that it was an army of one and it only consisted of him as Julia betrayed him also.- George Orwell’s writing style includes long descriptions of events that happened in the book such as the “Two Minutes Hate.” He also includes collection of emotion which represents the manipulation of hate and fear created by totalitarian societies. I almost felt like I was living in a society much like the one depicted in the novel because I also felt the emotion, or at least believed, Winston was feeling. Orwell’s opinions really became my own after reading the novel. The reason I chose this book was because of his other works, such as Animal Farm, and I also heard it was a good book to read. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone, but especially those who enjoyed reading Animal Farm because it is pretty much the same concept of expressing ideas of totalitarianism in an enjoyable way."
826,Filipa,Absolutamente fantástico.Review completa aqui: http://labirinto-livros.blogspot.com/...
827,João Miranda,"Não me recordo de ler ou ouvir uma crítica negativa a 1984. Os clássicos podem necessitar de tempo de adaptação. Será normal alguns não se mostrarem acessíveis ao pensamento e disposição contemporânea; já conheci quem não aprecie Dostoievski, por exemplo. Contudo, este livro parece estar imune a esse tipo de barreiras.Orwell apresenta um cenário totalitário numa superpotência mundial. O planeta encontra-se dividido em três entidades aglomeradoras dos países convencionais. Pouco sabemos de duas delas, já que a história caracteriza-se pela descrição incansável da atmosfera onde os principais personagens se inserem. Este regime totalitário, empregue pelo autor devido ao panorama vivido sob as políticas estalinistas, abomina e elimina qualquer liberdade física, moral ou emocional, eliminando a importância individual e acrescentando poder ao colectivo e ao ideal do partido dominante.Não queria alongar muito mais. O livro está dividido em três partes interessantes mas que podem ser consideradas como spoiler na sua descrição. É, sem dúvida, uma obra fantástica, e que conquistou o seu espaço de destaque na literatura mundial. Como já li noutro lado, é um livro que serve de aviso mas que não pode servir como guia de conduta."
828,Jareed,"Perhaps what makes this tale so gripping is the propensity of the imagined world to be translated in an objective observable human reality, more so as an empirical experience (not discounting that it may have been translated already). Orwell did a superb job merging a tragic romance and a corrupted political ideology. Worthy to be read beyond its years. "
829,Joshua Thomas,"I first read 1984 as a young teenager and found it disturbing and confusing. As I matured and began studying government and economics, I discovered this book had a lot to teach me. I read it again in my later high school years and found it very thought provoking and important in my daily life. 1984 made me realize the news and social media outlets are all very useful platforms for manipulation, but you don't have to let it be that way. It taught me to be more aware of the people around me and what's currently happening in the world. Other than its importance, I found George Orwell's storytelling to be very well written with many, many quotable lines that exceed modern dialogue by miles. Winston Smith is one of the most remarkable protagonists in literature. I highly recommend this novel to anyone after an existential view on life and after the concept of what freedom is, and why it's so important. Amazing work of literature. "
830,Monique Aslarona,1984 by George Orwell has not yet lost its appeal even after 80 years since it's first publication. The political views expressed in the novel remains very modern and significant for the current world events in which a kind of totalitarian government is a probability. It's a genius work written by a genius man with a deep understanding of the society around him and with the purpose of imparting to other people his ideals and stirring them to have the same. I'm sure it will continue to impact people for more years to come. 
831,John Durst,"For my 10th grade CP english class, I had to make a reveiw of a book that I read for my final project. When my teacher introduced this project to our class I was figuring it was just another book I had to read and just more work for me to complete. I started the book 1984 and wasn't excited to read it, but once I got into it, it was one of the best books I ever read. I love how the book dived into deep sci-fi like details of communism and controlling one's mind. It's the only book I've read where 2+2=5. I expected the project to be dull and boring, but instead, it was actually a very good read, so I would highly reccomend 1984 to anyone who is thinking about reading it."
832,Reema,This is one of the greatest novels I have ever read.
833,Abd Elrahman, الكاتب ألمعي على كل حال ليكتب رواية بهذة الروعة لكن أن تكتب شيئا ليُقرأ مرارا وتكرارا فحتما عائد لطباع البشر التى لا تتغير 
834,Meli,"I think I was expecting the ending to be what it was, and I do love the last sentence.The collective won while Winston thought about chess in terms of white always mating (checkmate, mate!). It's a shame that human nature was exhibited the way it was... but what else are we expecting in this dystopia? The only page that spoke about perfection was when Orwell gave us a glimpse into a world that was completely controlled... when O'Brien explains to Winston that the Party can do whatever it wants whenever it wants. We're talking about our ability to have power over everything, being able to control everything. We're not too far from that, actually, and if we are, there's only a matter of time.Another instance that I found riveting: Time. It was masterfully planned to have the book titled 1984 around the time of the book's publication in circa 1948-1949. The theme of time fleeting and being re-imagined (""He who controls the past controls the future"") reminded me of the conversations I've had with my sister about how far facts go. Usually with either of us asking each other, ""How do you know?"" How would we know if the information has been put there by a sect of people? How would we know if history books are quite plainly, ""His"" story books? There aren't many primary sources where the information given about crossing the harbor is straight from George Washington's journal entries, and penned by his own hand, I might add. It's incredible how very fragile and important the recording of time is. If the people of the past had nothing to go by (no hieroglyphs, no Mesopotamian Cuneiform, no sense of written language) they would have probably never existed. Civilization is built on language and records (not the kind you can play on a record player, by the way!). Note: I love how Orwell mentioned memory. It brings Dali's Persistence of Memory to mind, because, according to some studies (paid by who? I have no idea), after a while we begin to construct our own memories from scratch... so after a while, we'll be telling a ton of variations of the same memory that happened to us some time ago. Pretty standard for the old man who was asking for a pint when everyone else was having a liter.And now the part about the third part.Questioning the system and not doing anything about it is a road to nowhere.So it is expected that this character was not going to get out of the system as well as he had been before. It was something bittersweet that reminded me of my tears as I read Night by Elie Wiesel for Literature class back in 10th grade when we had 30 minutes reading time... and when I actually read into the book farther than I had expected at home (I basically started reading faster past the middle, and bam. I wouldn't let it go until Elie was done talking about his experience in Auschwitz). Winston's dehumanization reflected what I had seen of Night's ending... when the characters do not recognize themselves in the mirror. Save, Orwell went out the deep end of the spectrum of suitably subtle to (ohmygod) strong imagery. I felt the increasing need to embrace the book and embrace Winston for having gone through so much in the name of nothing at all.That's another thing. The oxymorons of the party's insignia, or rather, it's three main phrases:War is Peace.Freedom is Slavery.Ignorance is Strength.We are slaves to our rights, and slaves to the consumerist economy (at least here in the U.S. of A.). We are always watching the news about Iraq and Afghanistan. And we are always taking the Television's word for it instead of looking for our own sources.I like that Winston was caught. I like that there isn't a Happily-Ever-After. I also think that Winston is going to be killed because of that last sentence.Anyway, of overalls and hidden Thought Policemen, I am so done. So done. Also, I did not find the end as scary as I thought it would be, but it was f*#&ed up. I do think that Winston was reconditioned into subjugation by the means of pain rather than reward (as many psychological experiments have gone). I hate the part where O'Brien was trying to prove the collective right over individualism (2+2 = 4!!!! Goddamn it), but that's how stupid politics are. There is no need to show off how brainy you are, but how manipulative you can be. The man was enjoying ""cleansing"" Winston!The end where Winston neglects himself to forget far more than what he's forgotten for the sake of not remembering his painful memories. Anyway, yeah, I am just uber glad that I finally finished reading this book. I do wish that human nature was not what it appeared to be (""I betrayed you.""), but it works. *goes to sleep now because omg, I've been wanting to sleep during my ride on the transit, in which I managed to read 30-40 pages that I lacked reading for this baby*I recommend Orwell to anyone who has issues against and for social issues (just not pro-choice; that wasn't something Orwell wrote about, though I loved the part where he said a thick woman was beautiful in her own way... But the book in question can be Unwind by Neal Shusterman, because that's where human fatality lies: do your parents want you to live a life of comfort or bad habits that cause them their life?). Anyway... Oh!The prime of man has not been found... yet. Unless we're on a steady slope to it, because the world in this book sounded like it was slowly going downhill without the Party being past enough to build a solid set on it. If small and great pleasures are not free to people, what says that they'll be drugged sheep? (Also check out Across the Universe by Beth Revis; it's not as adult as this novel, but speaks more about the abuse of time as well as drugged sheep/people, basically.)Oh, and our current lives are not ready for a remake of the 1984 rendition of this book!!! People would get paranoid and start getting back on controversies alone."
835,Shane Cummings,"Be Wary of Big Brother	As I held George Orwell’s 1984 in my hands for the first time, I thought I knew the general plot of the novel. I knew it would be a tale of a dystopia, where “Big Brother,” the leader of the book’s totalitarian government, would be watching every move anyone made, constantly searching for signs of rebellion. As I started reading, I realized that I was right about the book’s premise, but that the plot was so much more in-depth and thought out than I realized. The story concerns Winston Smith, a man who works in the Ministry of Truth, a branch of the government that deals with altering history to make it seem like the government was always in control. Winston becomes dissatisfied with “Big Brother’s” regime and purchases a diary (which are illegal in this world) where he begins to vent his frustrations with it. The story deals with Winston’s struggles to resist the government, as well as his blooming love with his coworker, Julia, and his fascination with his boss, referred to only as “O’Brien.”	The book has its fair share of twists, turns, and surprises. After finishing the novel, one of Orwell’s messages is clear: Be wary of the government, and make sure you do not let them take away your personal freedoms. This theme rings truer than ever with the recent revelations about the NSA spying on the citizens of the United States. This novel helps to open people’s eyes and make them warier of their surroundings. As Winston said, “Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious” (70). Overall, the novel is a classic, a must-read for teenagers and adults alike. Not only is the book an Aesop about the dangers of governmental control, it is also an entertaining tale of hardship and love. Winston’s love for Julia is one of the driving factors toward keeping him from giving in to “Big Brother”; however, as the book progresses, it becomes harder and harder for Winston to stay defiant. While the book’s ending is somewhat of a downer, the novel as a whole helps to warn people against giving in to totalitarianism. In today’s world, this advice is more poignant than ever."
836,Nick Nyquist,"This book is tied for my favorite with East of Eden by John Steinbeck.This was brilliantly unique and unlike any utopian book I've ever read, and I've read a lot. As it is often said, it is an all too real story of what could happen. The disturbing parts of these books are the way they brainwash and torture and censor all so that they can keep power. The way they construct ideas about an endless war is terrifying, but fantastic. Something about this world draws me in. The way that the police are at every section of their country is crushing. How, just for the hell of it, they can change the basic laws of math and science.Maybe it's because nowadays, we rely so much on technology that later this may be our fate. This for sure shows how a true utopia can never work with human beings. There would have to be all this censorship and diabolical manipulation to do anything close to a perfect world. But this novel highlights how much the human race needs its art and lust and emotion more than it needs peace in a society. Politicians often look past what is at the base because they believe it isn't a problem anymore.When Orwell said that this could potentially occur, I didn't believe it. But as I consider it more and more everyday, perhaps it could.I will recommend this to anyone who is interested in the human race. Or anyone who enjoys the new YA dystopian books. See how this influenced every utopia book after it. Yes, even including The Giver, which took a lot from this."
837,Omar Samy," “He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.” It took me a long time to actually enjoy 1984, especially in the end. George Orwell hated Stalin, which is an observation I have noticed from his two books, 1984, and Animal Farm.George Orwell, I think, imagined a world where people like Stalin ruled the whole world, with a Stalin-like man watching over everybody. With Stalin-like enemies.. And everyone else was basically the Russians and the Ukrainians. And even though I have many Socialist ideas - I cannot call myself a hardcore Socialist though, because that would be an exaggeration - I totally agree that Stalin was a tyrant who murdered and starved his own people.Back to the book. I found his vision of what would now be called an alternate History much detailed with many symbols that make us ask ourselves about our future. What will happen to us?Will we always be free to say that 2 + 2 = 4 or just what we were forced to believe in?I think this is a great book to discuss that matter. And so, I have found it an amusing book and definitely worth the time."
838,Josefina,"Al principio tengo que admitir que me costó empezarlo y agarrarle la onda, porque no estoy del todo acostumbrada a este tipo de lectura un poco más pesada; pero acostumbrarme no me resultó difícil tampoco.Realmente interesante con una postura sobre el mundo muy crítica y con mucha información política: George Orwell crea un mundo comandado por un tal Hermano Mayor, con una nueva forma de lenguaje (creado para generar una nueva forma de pensar: el doblepiensa), La Policía del Pensamiento, que vigilaban cada uno de tus movimientos, los monitores y microfófonos escondidos para controlar hasta el aire que respiran y un sentido de la vida un tanto angustiante y en el caso de Winston, un poco paranoica.Probablemente lo que más me gustó de este libro es la explicación dada en forma de texto que el protagonista lee en este libro: Orwell lo pensó todo minuciosamente y nos lo explica detalladamente. La comparación entre este libro y otros mundos caóticos me fue imposible no hacer, y la mayor diferencia es que el personaje principal no es ningún héroe: él lo sabe, solo es una persona con ideales diferentes en un mundo que tiene sólo una forma admitida de pensar. Esto lo hace mucho más realista y al principio me generó un ¿cómo va a solucionar toda esta situación de mierda si ya estoy a mitad del libro y ni se unió a grupos clandestinos ni empezó su propia guerra ni nada? ¿Cómo lo va hacer en sólo un libro?. Pero ahí estaba mi error: es una historia sobre la esperanza y los valores sociales al mismo tiempo que no lo es: mirada por un punto de ista completamente diferente.
Podían averiguar hasta el último detalle de lo que habías hecho, dicho o pensado; pero el interior de tu corazón, cuyo funcionamiento era un misterio incluso para ti, seguía siendo inexpugnable.
"
839,آلاء,"The genius that is George Orwell did it again. This is the type of book you finish reading but never cease to think about it's contents and constantly draw parallels with our world today. Timeless indeed! Will definitely revisit the chapters from ""The Book""! "
840,Caleb Bird,"1984 Review- Caleb BirdWell I liked the book but I thought there was a lot that could be improved on. Winston, the main character of the novel, lives in a country where individual thought is banned, where only the leader, Big Brother, is allowed to reason and to decide. Prodded by his natural need for reflection and critical analysis, Winston finds it hard not to make use of his inborn talents. He starts questioning the wisdom of Big Brother and moves hopefully toward his own liberation. But in his struggle for emancipation he stands alone. The large mass of common people do not find in themselves the need to think independently, to question or to investigate what they have been taught and to love Big Brother, another slave is born, another cog is placed in the machinery of the State, and the last man in the world is dead.1984 is a political statement. It contains only a simple warning to mankind. Orwell did not believe that 35 years after the publication of his book, the world would be ruled by Big Brother, but he often proclaimed that 1984 could happen if man did not become aware of the assaults on his personal freedom and did not defend his most precious right, the right to have his own thoughts. It is the vigilance of the citizens that has prevented Big Brother from starting his reign in the free world. This vigilance, Orwell would say today, may not relent if freedom is to be saved.Orwell's imaginary States do not exist, but the world order of 1984 resembles in some ways the world of ''1984.'' Indeed, there are two major world powers with a third one on the rise. They seem to divide the world into three zones of influence. Which is just like Ocian, Eurasia, and East Asia. I am guessing he meant to do that.		The end of the book is very strange to me. I think it would have been a lot better if he had made it to where in the end Winston would have succeed and took down the party that is main part of the book that I could not believe. Also it seemed like it was a little slow to get to anything interesting and when it does it gets over that part and there are long spaces of very boring parts and in those parts George Orwell does not make it clear what is going on. 	Really it is a great book other that the boring and confusing parts but I enjoyed it at points."

843,Annisa Anggiana,"“There were four ministries the government was divided. The Ministry of Thruth concerned itself with news, entertainment, education and fine arts. The Ministry of Peace concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, which maintain law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak : Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv and Miniplenty.”For me, this book is an epic. An absolute masterpiece. A book that accurately translate collective human nature greediness over power. Nomor satu di daftar my best book of all time.Tokoh utama kita, Winston Smith bekerja di Ministry of Truth alias Minitrue. Winston tinggal di kota yang dulunya bernama London, dan kini disebut Airstrip One di suatu negara yang bernama Oceania. Di tahun 1984 di masa Winston hidup, kekuatan Dunia terbagi menjadi tiga bagian. Oceania, Eurostasia dan Eastasia yang terus menerus berperang satu sama lain.Ocenia dipimpin oleh suatu figur maha besar bernama “Big Brother”. Poster wajah Big Brother tertempel dimana-mana di seluruh tempat umum, dengan slogan khasnya “Big Brother is watching you”. Secara harfiah memang di dunia Winston pergerakan setiap orang terpantau melalui telescreen dan hidden microphone yang tersembunyi di mana-mana. Bahkan ketika anda berada di WC pun pergerakan anda terpantau telescreen. Privacy is a mere fantasy.Struktur masyarakat terbagi menjadi tiga bagian rigid. Inner Party adalah masyarakat dengan kekuatan paling atas yang menentukan kebijakan dan aturan. Outer Party adalah common people seperti Winston, para pekerja. Dan satu lagi adalah The Proles, masyarakat kumuh yang derajatnya nyaris disamakan dengan binatang. The Proles are inhuman.Setiap pemikiran untuk menghianati kebijakan Big Brother termasuk dalam kategori kejahatan. Cara bergerak, mimik wajah bahkan igauan dalam tidur pun bisa dijadikan bukti kejahatan terhadap negara. Catatan sejarah telah seluruhnya ditulis ulang sesuai dengan kepentingan partai dan dapat terus menerus diganti dan ditulis ulang jika dibutuhkan. Anak dididik untuk mematai orang tuanya dan menyerahkan orang tuanya ke partai sebagai penghianat jika melakukan tindak tanduk yang mencurigakan.Suatu hari ketika berjalan di sekitar daerah kumuh, Winston secara spontan membeli sebuah buku harian kosong. Buku harian tersebut memancing pemikiran-pemikiran yang selama ini terendap di kepala Winston. Semua doktrin dari Big Brother adalah suatu kebohongan. Apakah hanya ia yang memiliki ingatan akan hal ini? Maka Winston pun memutuskan untuk menulis di buku harian tersebut untuk mendokumentasikan pemikirannya. Winston pun menulis..“To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men are different from one another and do not live alone-to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone.From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of Big Brother, from the age of doublethink-greetings!”Sebuah langkah yang sangat berani mengingat pada saat itu sekedar “pemikiran” dapat dianggap sebagai sebuah kejahatan besar. Semakin banyak Winston berfikir dan menulis, semakin ia merasa gelisah. Satu orang tidak mungkin melawan seisi dunia.Kemudian Winston bertemu dengan Julia, anggota Outer Party yang tadinya Winston kira adalah seorang mata-mata alias Thought Police yang sedang berusaha untuk menangkapnya. Sampai suatu ketika dengan usaha yang hati-hati Julia berhasil menyelipkan secuil kertas yang bertuliskan “I Love You”.Bagaikan permainan Cat and Mouse mereka berdua berusaha keras menciptakan pertemuan-pertemuan di tempat-tempat tersembunyi. Pertemuan dengan Julia menimbulkan pemikiran-pemikiran baru dalam kepala Winston. Bahwa dahulu, di suatu masa, personal loyalty adalah sesuatu yang berharga. Rasa sayang dan ingin melindungi antara satu manusia dengan manusia yang lain adalah nyata. Di suatu saat di masa lalu. Sebelum diganti oleh idiologi Big Brother dimana kesetiaan dan cinta hanya boleh didedikasikan pada Big Brother. Winston menyadari bahwa anggota partai lah yang bukan manusia. The Proles dengan kebebasannya jauh lebih “manusia” daripada mereka.“Being a minority, even a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.”Winston dan Julia kemudian bertemu dengan O’Brien. Seseorang yang mereka kira adalah seorang sekutu. Apakah mereka akan berakhir bahagia? Of course not. Winston dan Julia akhirnya tertangkap dan mengalami penyiksaan demi penyiksaan. U see, seorang yang tertangkap karena pemikirannya tidak serta merta dihukum mati, mereka harus melalui serangkaian cuci otak untuk mengubah 180 derajat pemikiran mereka sehingga segaris dengan partai, baru kemudian dibunuh atau dilepaskan sesuai dengan kepentingan. Lalu apa akhir bagi Winston dan Julia? Hhhhh.. Cukup getir.. After all this Big Brother society is too well-constructed to break apart in the face of one man’s resistance..“And the people under the sky were also very much the same-everywhere, all over the world, hundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this, people ignorant of one another existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly the same-people who had never learned to think but who were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world.“"
844,Inês Beato,"Estava à espera de encontrar um bom livro, mas surpreendi-me ao encontrar um livro genial!A escrita de Orwell é brilhante, o enredo que construiu impressiona qualquer um, de forma assustadora. Escrito em 1948, esta obra mostra-nos um cenário imaginário daquilo que seria o mundo em 1984, de certa forma inspirado nos regimes totalitários do século XX, mas levado muito mais além.A ideia do Big Brother, de um mundo completamente controlado, onde a liberdade e a possibilidade de escolha são inexistentes parece, numa primeira analise, uma hipótese completamente descabida, sem qualquer sentido. No entanto, a forma como Orwell constrói este mundo utópico negativo parece de tal forma real que chega a ser assustador e leva a pensar se será possível algum dia algo deste género acontecer... É um livro perturbador, doentio e um pouco psicótico. É precisamente isso que o torna numa obra-prima fascinante."

848,Terrence,"I don't think I've ever seen something like this before.I love dystopian novels and films, mainly because they're different and controversial. 1984 by George Orwell, to me, was absolutely mind-blowing.Who could've possibly imagined an alternative world where such logic could exist? A world where the human being is degraded to such a kind of person where moral standards and humanitarianism is a joke. This novel made me step back and look at several horrifying truths about our society.A world where there are only three major governments, all totalitarianism governments, that control and monitor every single event in its domain. History and truth is ever changing to suit the government's needs, and people are ""vanished"" for the mere act of Thoughtcrime, an offence of simply thinking negative thoughts toward the government.Winston Smith, the protagonist of the novel is a person who sees through the government's lies and deceptions, and think that it is outright wrong. As the story progresses, we disturbingly see the human spirit rise with hope and then fall, vanquished pathetically. This book is terrifying, disgusting, and simply an amazing piece of work. This book is something that makes you think, no matter how hard you may or may not want to. Be grateful that we still have the privilege of privacy and freedom of speech, because this is the kind of world we would be living in without them.I truly and honestly look forward to reading George Orwell's Animal Farm in the very near future."
849,Marie-aimée,"Vraiment terrifiant ! Et pourtant, ce sont bien les impressions éprouvées lorsqu'on est paranoïaque, véritablement espionné ou surveillé par une entité supérieure qui vous met en position de faiblesse (et donc sous contrôle), toute infime pensée n'a d'autre peur et désarroi que d'être entendue, et surtout châtiée. Orwell marque là un coup de génie, le plus grand contre les totalitarismes, et donne des mots aux droits de l'Homme pour son pire cauchemar. A lire absolument !"

852,J.M. Hushour,"There probably remains little to be said about this book. It's the story of a rigid and conservative imperialist white-dominated political mass that finds power in the alteration of fact and the very meaning of history itself. Convincing its citizenry that if you believe you just floated to the ceiling and I believe you just floated to the ceiling then it means you just floated to the ceiling is part of its dogma. There are other nifty thought tricks and arguments cementing the apathy of the masses and the governing power's unquestionable control: wars steeped in falsehoods whose acceptance by the public is guaranteed by their own inability to think critically or to even remember what occurred a week before; science as a projection of a false reality whose efficacy is called into question by its own objectivity; and so on.Technological control of the masses is guaranteed by ever-present devices that monitor one's every move and thought. Even language itself comes under the politico-cultural boot-heel with communication being purposefully reduced down to truncated versions of former words, with sentences and syntax as incomplete as one's thoughts. Literature and the arts as a whole are churned out on an industrial scale to dictate the tastes of the day...Wait...this is fiction."
853,Hannah Cecilie Brænden,"Easily one of the best books I have ever read.A remarkable mixture of fantasy, love and political ideologies - a book which, in contrast to Animal Farm, not only contains strong political ultetior motives but but also a thrilling story of two induviduals who love each other.The book is an eye-opener, and portrays a society of totaliarism we must avoid. In this book, everything that could go wrong after 1948 (regarding the iron-curtain and the seperation of two worlds with two different ideologies) went wrong. At Orwell's time, the fear of the INGSOC society portrayed in the book was developed - a fear my generation finds it hard to regognize, considering the democratic world we rejoice ourselves in today. The novel paints a picture (distant picture for my generation) of a world we could be living in today, had events turned out differently than they did.1984 is a novel I found quite frightening to read, where all human values are whiped away by a totalitarian state - values such as friendship, freedom, hope, curiosity, induvidualism and even love. Induvidual human beings are not strong enouch to withstand the pressure from a constantly surveilling government - a government which makes you betray and forget the ones you love the most. 1984 portrays the deep, desperate need humans have for power, something that will never go away. 1984 is therefore an extremely important book everyone should read to remember the importance of democracy and individual freedom - something we must not, by all means, forget."

856,Adarsh Chauhan,"""The year 1984 has come and gone, but George Orwell's prophetic, nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is timelier than ever.""This book is timeless. It doesn't fail to haunt you by the future that could have been, or the future that could be. The ideas put forth by this will be as against-the-grain as ""War is Peace; Freedom is Slavery; Ignorance is Strength;"" but the author has so perfectly crafted this hopeless future, that like the notion of 'Big Brother', it is impeccable. It is like a masterpiece of story-telling, with mystery and thrill accompanying every part of the book. Apart from the idea of a totalitarian power which will rule the humans, which cannot fall, ever, this book feeds you with the thoughts about individual versus authority, thoughts about what is reality and the dynamics of human societies and the powers which rule them. And everything weaves together this incredible literary work which makes you realise most fundamentally, what makes you human. It is the peace you feel, the freedom you experience and the knowledge you possess.Live through 1984 and it will show you what classics are made up of."
857,Annnne,"This book changed my life. No, that's not an exaggeration and a biased comment (based on my love for George Orwell's writings), but it really did.This novel was recommended to me by my English teacher in high school when she heard that I have a voracious appetite for reading. Along with Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"" and Nathaniel Hawthorn's ""The Scarlet Letter"", Orwell's 1984 changed my perspective of the world. It opened my eyes to the grandeur mankind has created, our ability to push ourselves beyond imaginable limits and the worst vices of human nature that plagues our very existence and ultimately - to our downfall. I have lost count on how many times this novel have aided me in writing my essays for school. I delegate blame to this book for no longer seeing this world through tinted rose lenses, for I now look through these glassy sky scraping buildings, power suits, men who walk with grey eyes and wonder whether they are subject to their own ""Big Brother"". But then again, in today's society, aren't we all? O’Brien:  How does one man assert his power over another, Winston? Winston:  By making him suffer. O’Brien:  Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery and torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but MORE merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred."
858,Candice Hill,"Wow. This was an amazing book and I think everyone should read it. But as I say this, I know most people in our western society will only look at this being about eastern communism and not realizing they are just as bad, but they will use 'doublethink' to make themselves think otherwise. Even though this book is mainly about a political takeover of the human mind, I couldn't help but relating religion doing the exact same thing.My favorite quotes:'Crimestop' means the faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous thought. It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to Ingsoc(aka their religion), and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. Crimestop,in short, means protective stupidity.Oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the Party is infallible. But since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the Party is not infallible, there is need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts. Applied to a Party member, it means the loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the abiltiy to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. Pg. 212 Thus, the Party rejects and vilifies every principle for which the Socialist movement orginally stood, and it chooses to do this in the name of Socialism. Pg. 216Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past. Pg. 248You would not make the act of submission which is the price of sanity. You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. Pg. 249""No. I believe it. I know that you will fail. There is something in the universe-- I don't know, some spirit, some principle-- that you will never overcome."" ""Do you believe in God Winston?""""No.""""Then what is it, this principle that will defeat us?""""I don't know. The spirit of Man."" Pg. 270Anything could be true. The so-called laws of nature were nonsense. The law of gravity was nonsense. ""If I wished,"" O'Brien had said, ""I could float off this floor like a soap bubble."" Winston worked it out. ""If he thinks he floats off the floor, and if I simultaneously think I see him do it, then the thing happens. We imagine it. It is hallucination."" He pushed the thought under instantly. The fallace was obvious. It presupposed that somewhere or other, outside oneself, there was a ""real"" world where ""real"" things happened. But how could there be such a world? What knowledge have we of anything, save through our own minds? All happenings are in the mind. Whatever happens in all minds, truly happens. Pg. 278What was required in a Party member was on outlook similar to that of the ancient Hebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that all nations other than his own worshipped ""false gods."" He did not need to know that these gods were called Baal, Osiris, Moloch, Ashtaroth, and the like; probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy. He knew Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah; he knew, therefore, that all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods. Pg. 306 (Sound familiar all my religious followers?)"
859,Daniel Moskowitz,"Who controls the present now, controls the past. Who controls the past now controls the future, Who controls the present now... NOW TESTIFY!!! This book is THAT good. So much so that every movie/novel afterwards ceased to be simply dystopian or anti-conformity and simply became '1984-esque'. Not to say that any book of such themes is bad, in fact I still might hold Fahrenheit 451 in higher regards. But obviously 1984 is the gold standard and this I believe for a simple reason...Spoiler: Most definitive works are so good that most who read/watch think that there is no need to see another film of a similar theme ""After _____ everything else doesn't match up"". However, Orwell's depiction of the Party is so convincing that you HAVE to go watch/read/write/create a similarly themed story with at least some measure of victory at the end. Fahrenheit offered a glimpse of better things to come while Equilibrium showed you the final uprising. But you will never NEED those victories as much as you do after reading 1984. Because if you don't, if you leave yourself hanging on the Winston's famous last words... you might start to believe that the light at the end of the tunnel IS actually Room 101 as you start to calculate in your head the possibility that 2 + 2 might actually equal..... 1984 (see how I did that there)."

863,Joaquin,"I guess the best prophets are those whose prophecies can abolish the very future they predict. The world of 1984 is both frighteningly plausible and implausible, it's terrifyingly dystopian.I couldn't help but find innumerable parallels with Scientology (and other cults and religions too, but the case for Scientology is even stronger).This books works as an essay and cautionary tale, the plot and characters are not the focus, but rather the world and mentality are. I was immersed from beginning to end. I understood the way people thought in that world, and at the same time I found no solution to the story other than a tragic one.This is a book everyone should read."

865,Ixan,One of the best books ever. Its still the future though the title is dated.
866,Aidan Emory," From the summary you can guess that the story takes place in 1984. It all starts out in a fictional place called Oceania where a totalitarian, post World War II superpower rules everything. The main character Winston Smith has an imagination and ideals that could get him in big trouble. The government watches everybody threw television screens and other various devices. Winston is very naïve so he creates a journal expressing his views of the government, most often they are in a derogatory way. If he was caught he would be executed for his wondering mind. To add gasoline to the flame Winston begins to have a love affair with a coworker named Julia. They only show there with each when they are in hiding, at least that’s what they think. To end an oh so interesting book he joins a “Brotherhood”, a so called resistance. He meets a guy called O’Brien but he just happens to be a police. They take him and torture him till he rejoins society with the new government’s ideals. Even though this book is a classic I think that many people of the younger generation would be captivated by the book. I say this because of the action and that keeps the attention of the reader. It gives you suspenseful feeling that you always have to be looking over your shoulder. This would give the reader an ideal of what kind of government they would not want to have. I was very satisfied with book so I have it five stars. The reason I gave this book five stars is because I love books that talk about government and how they should work. From dictatorships to communism they all speak of ways of creating peace but they all seem to have flaws. So in this book they chose a totalitarian government so they could control every aspect of society. This gives me a sour vibe but it widens my view to be thankful for what I do have. That is why I gave this book five stars."
867,Timoj 7," 1984 review (spoilers)Imagine a world where your basic rights are obsolete, every conversation is recorded, you are always being followed, and one wrong word can end your life. This is what life is like in George Orwell's world. This is one of Orwell's classic books. He explores the subject of total governmental control with mentions of history being altered and the concept of Newspeak. The book also explores the main character, Winston, and his transformation from being apathetic of Big Brother to openly being against him. It also has a side story, in which Winston discovers a fellow Party member named Julia, and eventually falls in love with her.In short, if you are interested in what life might be like in a totalitarian dictatorship or if you just want a good love story with a twist, then this is the book for you."
868,Peter Mantziaris,"1984Nineteen eighty four is a must read for young adults, the book is breathtaking and with some thought you can equate it with modern life and the technology age. This book is the leader in the dystopia genre, Winston the main character and every other person not in control of big brother were constantly suppressed and limited and swayed in what type of thoughts they had. Big Brother was just a concept to instill fear in people so that the party would keep their control like in a communist party.The book is has a connection with modern time, the telescreens represent the CCTV and the newspeak represent the news providers creating and displaying propaganda. Censorship was also a big thing in the book, one thing going on right now in some countries like china and some islamic states. The book having these connections makes it a better read for me after I take time to reflect on how closely related all the topics discussed are to modern times.Winston Smith positively depict that he was in a horrible spot. Winston and his illegal relationship, Julia, were both held hostage by the general public that they lived in and couldn't even consider another alternative, for even this was restricted. Later they would both go on and go against Big Brother by meeting in a secret place. Winston’s friend O’Brian would help him out with the love affair going on; O’Brian was working with the party later setting up Winston and Julia while they were having their thing. In doing this they wanted to prove that Big Brother was still in control and no one could go against him. During this point the book started to get to a point Where it got more interesting, the plot twist was not that expected unless you were reading all the hints to it before it happened. While bringing Winston into room 101 the book got a little messed up in the way that Orwell wanted to get Winston to give up Julia, Otherwise the book always kept you thinking making it a good read."

870,Ambreen,"This was a really tough book to read, especially towards the end. The sheer lack of any humanistic values of the people around the protagonist was appalling. The brainwashing, the torture, the forceful conversion, and the lack of any sort of privacy made this an extremely depressing, though a very interesting story. A lot of what has been foreseen in this book has definitely come to pass, but I still think our world is not as harsh as the one shown in 1984. However, it could certainly be going in that direction. While the brainwashing is very obvious in the story, it is very subtle in our world. Nonetheless, it is still there. This is the type of book that you have to discuss with a lot of people, because it has such vast ideas present in it. One such idea is ""doublethink"" that is the ability of a person to hold two contradictory statements and believe in both. Others such as ""thought crime"" and ""newspeak"" really open your mind. I was often thinking of Brave New World while reading this. While the future in that world is based on pleasure and happiness, the one in 1984 is based purely on hatred and fear. In the end, both these worlds lack any meaning in an individual's life. I found 1984 to be more poignant and straight forward, as compared to the scientific focused Brave New World which often got boring. 1984 really deserves all the hype it has gotten as I felt a lot of emotions reading this-mainly shock.

873,Biondy,"I hate the introduction. Gara-gara baca bagian introduction-nya, malah kena bocoran cerita -_-. Kenapa harus taruh bocoran ceritanya di awal? Kalau memang mau taruh analisa bukunya, mending di belakang, deh. Nineteen Eighty-Four bercerita tentang Winston, seorang pria 39 tahun yang tinggal di Oceania, sebuah negara (semacam) totalitarian. Winston bekerja di Record Departement, sebuah departemen pemerintahan yang bertugas untuk menyesuaikan sejarah. Tugasnya adalah mengubah catatan-catatan sejarah yang ada (misalnya artikel di koran/majalah) agar sesuai dengan masa depan. Misal, pemerintah meramalkan bahwa jumlah produksi barang A adalah sejumlah X, tapi ternyata jumlah itu tidak sampai, maka tugas Winston adalah mengubah berita yang ada.All one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every class of reorded fact, great or small. Everything faded away into a shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become uncertain. (hal. 44)Winston, yang merasa tidak puas dengan kondisinya, merindukan sebuah kebebasan sejati. Dalam kondisi itu, dia mulai menjalin hubungan dengan Julia, gadis di Fiction Departement. Walau tahu bahwa hubungan mereka terlarang, Winston dan Julia tetap menjalankannya sebagai bentuk pembangkangan terhadap pemerintah. Tapi, berapa lama hubungan mereka akan bertahan tanpa diketahui, mengingat setiap langkah warga selalu diawasi oleh pemerintah?But you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the party. It was a political act. (hal. 133)Yeah, ada banyak topik yang dibicarakan di buku ini. Tidak mungkin semuanya bisa dibicarakan di ulasan pendek ini. George Orwell membawa kita menelusuri sebuah dunia yang tidak memberikan tempat pada individualitas. Tidak ada ruang pribadi. Semuanya dilakukan untuk pemerintah. Semua gerakan diawasi oleh pemerintah atas nama Big Brother, sang tokoh pemimpin pemerintahan.Buku ini sendiri mungkin memiliki kelemahan-kelemahan seperti yang dipaparkan di introduction jilid yang kubaca. Misalkan tokohnya yang dibilang dua dimensi dan ada hanya untuk menunjukkan karakteristik pemerintahan yang ada. Kupikir mungkin ada benarnya, tapi mungkin memang akan seperti itu karakter yang ada mengingat bagaimana pemerintah mengondisikan masyarakatnya di buku ini. Kekurangan yang ada tidak membuat buku ini kemudian menjadi jelek, karena ada banyak poin kuat yang membuat buku ini ""klasik"".Saya juga akan memperingatkan bahwa ""1984"" bukanlah ""The Hunger Games"". ""1984"" adalah sebuah novel distopia ""tradisional"" dalam hal nuansanya yang menimbulkan depresi. Jadi, kalau mencari buku distopia yang optimis seperti THG, saya sarankan untuk membaca buku ini dengan pola pikir yang berbeda.Secara keseluruhan, seperti yang Ben Pimlott tulis di introduction, ""erroneus thought is the stuff of freedom.""

878,Ryan Damour,"Goodreads Critique-1984 by George OrwellGeorge Orwell’s 1984 takes place in his own surprisingly accurate guess of the year 1984 from 1949. Its about Winston Smith in the country of Oceania, and the tyrannical government that crushes all rebellious acts including thoughts. Winston Smith is very opposed towards the government and he decides to start rebelling in his own ways.This book is filled with themes and lessons like the government is more powerful than you think, and that the government will become corrupt in the future. The government is always watching us, not on telescreens like they are in the book, but on cameras or by looking at our own private messages. Luckily we know about this thanks to Edward Snowden, but that brings me to the other theme, that we know less about the government than we think. I think that the government is still watching us in their own ways, This book can be compared to the book the Hunger Games. They are both about an extremely tyrannical government, but in 1984 the government punishes the thought the same as they would a robbery or murder in the Hunger Games to exert unwavering power over the people. One thing about the book was that the beginning was slightly boring and didn’t capture my attention. After the beginning though, it was extremely interesting and one of the best books that I have ever read. I recommend this book to people looking for a book with romance and a plot extremely intricate and complex that will have you wondering what's next on every page of the book."
879,Ryan Jackson,"This book was so entrancing that I actually felt strange reading it. I become so engrossed in the author's world that I found myself wanting to look around to see if, indeed, Big Brother was watching me. This book is as important now as it was when it was written. In the words of the late great Cristopher Hitchens, when describing North Korea, ""Its as though Kim Jong-il read 1984 and said 'can we do this? Lets give it the old college try'."" A very haunting book that I literally forced myself to stop reading so that I could get two hours of sleep before working the next day."
880,James Steele,"Chilling. Terrifying. All too real and all too possible.This is the book to read if you want to see masterful world-building in action. The entire first third of the story is world-building. There's almost no dialogue, no action, no plot. It takes Orwell one-third of the page count just to set up his vision.It's a world where everyone is monitored day and night. Actions are not a crime in this society; *thoughts* are criminal.Winston is a member of the Outer Party (the government), and he is one of the people responsible for altering the past. One of the first examples we receive is the chocolate ration. A news report states the ration for chocolate is reduced from 30 grams to 20. Winston's job is to go back over newspaper articles and newsreels that featured government promises of the chocolate ration not being reduced, and change them to warnings that a reduction may come. One day later, newsreels start reporting that the ration is being *increased* to 20 grams a week.And everyone accepts it. People celebrate Big Brother, the symbolic head of the government, for his decision to bestow this generous gift on the people. Everyone simply forgets that there was a time when the ration was higher. They accept this alteration of the past, and the government's propaganda that times are good and always getting better, when in fact they are continually deteriorating. This is just one example of the terrifying society Winston inhabits. Orwell never comes out and states what the government is doing. He instead presents all the different methods the Party uses: convincing the people that the orgasm is a crime, erasing people from the record, and Newspeak.What hit me hardest is Winston's conversation with Syme, one of the developers of a new language called Newspeak. Syme's explanation that ""shades of meaning"" are being eliminated from English, and Shakespeare will have to be rewritten to reflect it, slapped me across the face. Not only is the government manipulating people's memories, but they're making it impossible for people to have rebellious thoughts.If people can't remember happier times, but instead are convinced that they are living in perpetually good times (even as those conditions deteriorate), they people will always stay in their place. If they lose the ability to have thoughts, feelings and emotions in the first place, they will never want to overthrow the government.The proles, the working people, are living in perpetual poverty, but are happy to live in it and never complain because as far as they remember, there have never been better times to live. Chocolate rations have always been high, standard of living has always been wonderful, and times are good. But they are uneducated animals scraping a pointless existence out of the refuse of an unending world war. They mindlessly accept what they're told, do not strive to achieve anything, and don't even know they're oppressed. The government has seen to that; everything they do is to keep the people docile and in their place so the ruling class (the Inner Party) can live in luxury. That is scary.This is masterful world-building. The story is almost irrelevant. The real focus is the world Orwell creates. A truly terrifying and completely believable vision of a future that may have already happened, and we'd never know it. It had my head spinning for hours after I finished it. I strive to blow my readers’ minds away like this, too. It is the best novel I’ve ever read.I did a book/movie comparison. Check it out!"
881,Caroline,So disturbing certain aspects have stayed fresh in my mind for the past 35 years. And even more disturbing - parts of it have come true. 
882,Deborah,"Winston Smith believes it is 1984 (although he doesn't know for sure). He was a kid when the world changed for the worse. Now he is a Party member who works in the Ministry of Truth altering the past according to the desire of ""Big Brother"" and the Inner Party. Winston tries to put on the face of a good Party member but secretly detests his country and leaders. He has memories of past events that he is required to alter, sees through The Two Minutes Hate, and falls in love. In a world where every move is watched, how long can Winston rebel?Many parallels to today's time. Couldn't put it down."
883,Carolina,"Este livro é maravilhoso. É um daqueles livros tão inteligentes que em certas alturas aprendi imenso e fiquei deslumbrada, enquanto noutras, inevitavelmente, me senti muito burra porque não consegui perceber onde é que o sr. Orwell estava a tentar chegar.Apesar de me parecer estar aqui uma crítica ao socialismo, posso identificar várias coisas que não são comuns apenas aos regimes socialistas e inclusivé algumas coisas que se aplicam aos dias de hoje, o que só fez o livro mais interessante para mim.Mil Novecentos e Oitenta e Quatro é um daqueles livros que nunca fica aborrecido, fica sempre cada vez mais interessante e desafiante. A história é super cativante e, para mim é um dos livros que mais me cativou e envolveu, fez-me sentir verdadeiramente lá.Talvez não devolva este livro à Madalena."
884,Renfield,"As this book is one of my all time favourites, it seems only fitting that My first review in this site should be about it. Despite the fact that it is a bleak, and pessimistic story, it is still amazingly well written. Orwell really manages to portray the everyman protagonist in Winston Smith as a normal, sane, rational human being who through no fault of his own is in an irrational, insane, unfair situation.He really is a character that you not only empathies with, but can put yourself in his shoes, and so when everything is taken away from him (up to and including his humanity) it really hits home because the character is by that point under your skin. even in a seemingly happy ending where he gets his ""freedom"" and a well paid job, its a hollow and quite depressing end because he lost his positive emotions, his sense of self and above all, his love. and that saddens me, because I do and have always believed that love, Real love, can endure almost anything. and to not be able to hold it in your heart is a betrayal of self as well as the other person. I've read this book a handful of times and despite the hollow feeling it leaves me with, and the sense of paranoia that it enforces in me. I still really like this book, and I'm still not sure why. "
885,Kathryn Glenn,"When I first started reading this, I thought it was interesting but very far-fetched. But then I realized that much of it is so similar to a nonfiction book I happened to be reading at the same time - Wild Swans. Much of Wild Swans focuses on life in communist China. The parallels are creepy - the cult and power of Mao/Big Brother, denunciations, the ignorance and brutality of the common people, rigid and controlled lives, brainwashing and suffering of millions, blind obedience, disallowance of human relationships, etc...so creepy!!"
886,Geoff,"I started to read this a few months ago, but I just couldn’t get into it in the first few pages. Setting it aside was apparently the right thing to do because when I read it this time I enjoyed everything about it (with the exception of the ending). 1984 counts for both my 2012 Back to the Classics Challenge (20th Century Classic) and The Classics Club.Once again, as it seems happens more and more frequently, I’m at a loss of how to respond to a novel. I both loved and hated 1984. I thought the ending was a bit tough to get through, but once you got through it the middle of the novel was amazing and kept me wanting to know what happened, but then the ending was let down, even though I get it.I want to talk a bit more about the ending. I mean I get why it happened the way it did and I think Orwell was right in doing what he did. Part of this books charm/draw is that for 99% of the book Orwell keeps you interested and hopeful that Winston will break the trend, will do what no one else (that we know of) will be able to do. Even at the end of the novel you think – this is it, he’s going to break free, but then Orwell shuts you down and you, the reader, begin to feel the helplessness and despair that the party members of Oceania must feel.Click here to continue reading on my blog The Oddness of Moving Things."
887,Hussein Elyaddak,"إنسانية الكتاب جعلته واقعياً جداً على الرغم من خيالية الأحداث. فأورويل يتحدث عن عصر من اللاوعي، والذي في إعتقاد أهل السلطة أنهم إن تمكنوا من عقل البشر فلا وجود لقوانين الطبيعة ولا للعلوم ولا للحقائق ولا للمنطق، لأن ما يضعونه في العقول هو الحقيقة ولا شيء غيرها. فالسلطة هي الحاضر، ومن يمتلك الحاضر يمتلك الماضي والمستقبل.كتاب يمكنك أن تقتبس منه كل فقرة لتكون مثالاً أو حكمة رائجة، وستجد أن جعلها تعليقاً على الواقع الذي نحياه -وخصوصاً نحن أهل العرب- لا يحتاج إلى ذرة مجهود. رواية سوداوية وبائسة ولكن تكمن في إنسانيتها -مرة أخرى- جوهر جمالها. آخذ عليها وجود فقرات توضيحية طويلة في كثير من الأحيان، ولكني أدركت أهميتها في تبيان مدى التطرف الانهائي التي وصلت إليها الأمور في ذلك العالم الخيالي/الواقعي.المفاجأة أنك في ظل تلك الصراعات الدرامية والنفسية وأحداث الظلم والديكتاتورية والإجرام والألم فإنك لن تتأثر بهم كما ستتأثر بما آلت إليه علاقة الحب في حياة ونستون. رواية تجمع المتناقضات، فكما كان مصطلح ""إزدواجية التفكير"" من أهم المؤثرات المزروعة في نفوس الناس، فإن الرواية ستجعلك تطلق عليها لفظ الكابوسية/الحالمة في الآن ذاته كذلك."
888,Joe,"My second reading of ""1984"" reassured its position at the top of my favorite novels. George Orwell is able to capture, with a prophetic voice, perhaps the greatest horror story of all time--a future society that has reached an equilibrium. The absence of progress, or legal free thought for that matter, is a frighteningly convceivable reality when told by Orwell. That humanity could take such a turn, sacrificing liberty for contrived happiness, with government as a means to an indefinite end, seems altogether possible when one considers the development of class struggle as described in Goldstein's book.It is only natural to identify with Winston and his state of cognitive dissonance in the Ministry of Love because everything that O'Brien preaches defies logic yet facilitates the Party's pusuit of power, thus making it entirely logical. Even more disheartening than the torture scenes are their result--Winston's loss of the last vestiges of his freedom as his mind finally embraces doublethink is culminated in the final, harrowing sentence."

890,Slung0518,"1984 is interesting among science fiction because it isn't, so to speak, science fiction. It doesn't have anything to do with science or technology. The year 1984 may have come and gone, but the scary thing about it is that it really could have happened in the year 1984, and it could happen today. It's a really interesting book because it's more of a philosophy book than a science book. What would life be like if the government controlled everything you did? What if all of human society was controlled by a Party that destroyed and falsified evidence against it, was constantly watching you, and even controlled language so that it was literally unthinkable to go against it? In this new society, the only emotions are “fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement” (page 267). The main character, Winston Smith, works in the Ministry of Truth, a branch of the Party that works to falsify evidence to make it seem like everything’s in the party’s favor. The public, which has no memory, thinks that society is getting better and better while in reality it’s getting worse and worse. During one part of the book, Winston has to change an article which says that chocolate rations have been lowered from 30 grams to 20 grams. The next day, there is a speech on how plentiful everything is, including that chocolate rations have been raises to 20 grams. Because of his position in the government, Winston is alone in his possession of a memory. He notices this when during Hate Week, a patriotic celebration of the war against Oceania’s enemy, Eastasia, the speaker changes his point of view mid speech and claims that Oceania was always at war with Eurasia, Oceania ally, and allies with Eastasia. Seeing all the anti-Eastasia posters, the crowd thinks the celebration’s been hijacked by terrorists. He gets quickly found out because of telescreens, a monitoring system that the Party uses which are everywhere and constantly blast out pro-Oceana news while keeping the people under surveillance.It’s a philosophy book in that there is a lot of metaphysics involved in the plot. When Winston is taken to the Ministry of Love, the building that the Party uses to torture and correct “heretics,” he and O’Brien, the member of the Party who tortures him, have a long conversation in which he tries to prove to Winston that the Party is infinitely powerful. An interesting point that he makes is that the past and even the present are dependable on human experience. “Before man there was nothing. After man, if he could come to an end, there would be nothing. Outside man, there is nothing” (page 265). When you destroy the evidence for the past, there is no way of proving that it ever existed. There is no way to disprove that “(The stars) are bits of fire a few kilometers away...The Earth is the center of the universe. The sun and stars go around it” (page 265). There is a word in Newspeak, the official language of the Party, called doublethink, meaning to destroy all evidence against the Part while still keeping it in your head. Another concept that is explored is the concept of “sanity is statistical.” If everybody thinks the same way, even though it might seem insane, there’s no way of knowing if you have nothing to compare it to. “The Party has the power to make two and two equal five.” (repeated several times throughout the book)."
891,Davide,"Leggere questo libro vuol dire assistere a quello che l'umanità non dovrebbe mai vivere (o aver vissuto).In uno scenario postatomico, in cui 3 grandi continenti in lotta tra loro si sono divisi la Terra, gli individui sono assoggettati ad una forma di governo ultratotalitaria che interviene in ogni singolo attimo della loro vita. Amore, sesso, cibo, tabacco, tempo libero, divertimenti, tutto ciò che può portare i cittadini a distrarsi dai dettami del Partito è messo al bando e duramente condannato. Il controllo, dei comportamenti e dei pensieri, della storia e della memoria, è il cardine del Partito, comandato dal Grande Fratello, il padrone assoluto dello Stato, le cui immagini sono sparpagliate in ogni angolo della città, ma che nessun cittadino ha mai visto di persona. Gli fa da contraltare Goldstein, il capo di un fantomatico movimento rivoluzionario, che attenta, stando alle dichiarazioni del Partito, alla sicurezza degli individui. Sicurezza garantita anche attraverso una guerra costante che vede perennemente coinvolti tra loro i tre continenti nemici. Ma quanto può far male venire a sapere che spesso le bombe che uccidono centinaia di persone sono lanciate non dai nemici ma dal proprio Stato per mantenere uno stato di paura inalterato?In questo scenario si dibatte la figura di Winston Smith, un membro subalterno del partito, che inizia a dar cenni di una ribellione al sistema tanto necessaria quanto pericolosa e che trova linfa in una ragazza simile a lui.1984 è un capolavoro assoluto, con un Orwell geniale e visionario che dipinge i tratti di quello che non vorremmo mai diventare ma che in qualche modo, forma o maniera in qualche parte della Terra è già accaduto ed accadrà di nuovo."

894,Izzy Baird,"1984 by George Orwell is the story of a dystopian society based on the author’s idea of the world he lived in in 1949, and how it would evolve in the future. This story is the most famous dystopian novel ever written and was great enough to create a whole new category of books. In Orwell’s society of the future one was required to believe whatever lies ‘The Party’ and ‘Big Brother’, the government, told. If one did not comply, he or she would be convicted of a ‘thought crime’ by the ‘thought police’ and would be executed or sent to labor camps. The protagonist, Winston Smith, works for The Party in the Ministry of Truth, rewriting the past to what The Party wants it to be. This job gives him the power of memory, leading him to believe The Inner Party guilty of ‘doublethink’, being conscious of the truth while lying. Winston searches for The Brotherhood, a group opposed to The Party, which may or may not exist, as he looks for ways to overthrow the government. Most importantly he searches for the truth. What are The Party’s motives? The constant war? And ultimately, what really happened in the past? The reader gets the opportunity to be part of Winston’s discovery process and feels a part of his struggles against The Party. This book was well written in Orwell’s signature straightforward style. The style of writing gives the reader a sense that he or she is there and watching everything happen. As a result, 1984 is a page-turner, bringing the reader into the story to explore this world, though the plot is also exciting. Orwell’s writing creates a sense of urgency that the dystopian society is completely possible. His vision of the future is interesting, too, not because it seems so impossible but because parts of it mirror today’s society, such as the principles of doublethink, not knowing the truth, and always being watched.While 1984 is extremely well written, this is not a book for children or young adults. It is emotionally disturbing, with motifs such as betrayal and fear. From the first page the question is always ‘Who can Winston trust?’ This idea is common in today’s society. Many question whether they can trust the government, companies, or even friends. Winston is betrayed by many and, in turn, betrays them. The reader learns that in this world, it is impossible to trust anyone, even oneself. Orwell also shows what fear can do to a person through the infamous Room 101, where ‘thought criminals’ are brought. The threat of being sent to Room 101 can force one to believe that 2+2=5, freedom is slavery, and good is bad. The dystopian future of 1984 is felt in the world today, but even more so in the fictional world popular among teenagers and young adults. Ideas from 1984, such as censorship, totalitarian governments, fake histories, and being fed lies are seen in many popular dystopian novels, such as The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and The Giver by Lois Lowry. The fact that fears from 1949 have carried over to 2012 is interesting given that the world has changed so much. It makes one wonder whether these are natural human fears or whether things are increasingly heading in a frightening direction. 1984, being the most famous dystopian novel has set a precedent for others of its genre. While the plot is similar to other dystopian society novels, it is better written, much more interesting and is the source of many ideas that are prevalent in books today. "
895,Paolo Zanella,"Terrificante affresco di una società del futuro immersa nell'assolutismo più totale.L'ambientazione contraddice tutti i principi di democrazia in cui noi occidentali veniamo cresciuti, risultando odiosa a chi questi ideali li dà per scontati.Si ha per tutta lo svolgimento della trama un terribile senso di oppressione e paranoia, la sensazione che la catastrofe sia imminente e, più avanti, l'impressione che dall'incubo non vi sia via di uscita.I risvolti orribili di un potere che è invincibile ed eterno si presentano uno dopo l'altro, disegnando scenari ansiogeni che spaventano più delle trovate di molta fiction horror.Il diritto al libero pensiero negato è forse la cosa più orribile e presto ci si rende conto che è il passo iniziale, e anche quello finale , della distruzione dell'uomo come entità autocosciente.Ottimo l'escamotage del libro letto dal protagonista per inserire nel romanzo un saggio di Orwell sulla politica e la gestione del potere, ottimamente scritto e molto illuminante.Un libro di una forza rara, che sarà sempre attuale, perché lo spettro dell'abuso del potere è insito nella natura dell'uomo.Secondo me un testo che andrebbe letto in tutte le scuole, perché è con la cultura che si alimenta la democrazia, non certo con i fucili o i reality show."
896,Yomna hosny,"‎""Power is not a means it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish a dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.""-George Orwell. 1984I wonder, if Orwell was alive today would he think we were still going in the same direction he predicted? Would he think of websites like Facebook that offered to keep track of your whereabouts and activities everywhere you go and at all times as similar to the ""telescreen"" that watched you and waited for you to slip up?I wonder how long it will be before the thought police come bearing down on us, condemning us of ""thoughtcrime""! Or has it been happening all along and we've just been too distracted to notice?!Already, some governments require their faithful voters to practice ""Doublethink"" in order to support their criminal wars raged for power and resources and not for the overtly stated purposes!!Already some people have adapted themselves to the reality that war need not be justifiable! it need not be in defense of freedom. It need only be frenzied and constant.The lessons we are meant to learn from 1984 are as viable and applicable in today's world as they were the day the novel was published!In fact, this is more than a novel.. this is a warning. This is a prophecy.."
897,Firman Imaduddin,"It was one of the best literary experience I've ever had. Started out slowly, the book tried to relate and immerse us in a possible world of complete authoritarianism without the slightest room for personal freedom. The protagonist tried to keep his 'sanity' in an absurd world under a suffocating pressure designed in the evilest way one can imagine. Then, he discovered love and lust for a woman as an embodiment of his humanity and as a form of rebellion against the mechanical society.But the book truly shined later, close to the climax. Orwell ingeniously challenged the value of humanity, exposing how frail the nature of altruism and love in the face of overwhelming power. He questioned even the nature of our cognition and reasoning and argued the possibility of an ideology where the purpose of life and power is not the replication of life itself, but merely the replication of the idea. A wild and dark way to defeat the ever present fear of death and annihilation swimming deep inside every living being.An idea of a society oriented not in a preservation effort of the species and the gene, nor in freedom or self actualization, but by killing humanity and life instinct and replacing it with a power cult using a sophisticated method of education, enforcement and supervision. With the help of a terrifying, carefully systematized reasoning method involving solipsism as dark version of a 'leap of faith' in a kierkegaardian sense. That idea is both my biggest criticism and fascination. Is it possible even for an extremely powerful and meticulously crafted political system to override human instinct? Some religion and ideology proved that it is possible, but all of them in one way or another always relied on life and immortality. Even a suicide bomber is motivated by heavenly pleasures, and a war hero might have been motivated by a notion of immortality through respect, legend, or simple well being of their kin. Power has never been the end, it was always a mean for life. But the the 'aristocracy' of Oceania doesn't even overindulge, neither they try to inherit their power to their kin. Can the sheer power of dogmatized reasoning kill off the human instinct? I don't think so, it sounded like an absurd idea, yet it left a sense of wonder about human and life."
898,Luka Nagode,"The way Orwell describes this dystopian world is absolutely marvellous. Only by this book it is really seen how the world would have become if it was ruled by dictators, even ones we don't really see. It is a great representation of how the world treats people who want to and actually do think differently and are not mere puppets, but also desire to see something else than what they're seeing and doing. It shows us how the world treats love and compassion. It shows us how we trust without thought and end up in places we only dreamed about in nightmares. It shows us how blind we can be as humans. Excellently written."
899,Leif,"In a word, 1984 was stunning. Its parallels with real society is pretty scary. 1984 is the story of an omnipresent, omnipotent, and omnimalevolent ruling class simply called ""The Party"", that has seized control of a country now known as Oceania, once known many years ago as Great Britain, and has firmly and forcefully planted itself in a position of total power. The story follows a forty-something year old man by the name of Winston Smith, who begins to reminisce about the past years, but can't quite fully remember everything. The Party takes freedom away in every aspect, rewriting history as the need, making the public believe anything that they need, plastering propaganda on every street corner, keeping watch at all times everywhere with the telescreens, and enforcing the thought police on the unaware public, all represented by the figure of ""Big Brother"", the dictator of Oceania. In this world, simply saying or writing your thoughts loud can get you killed or worse, reproduction is only used for increasing the population with no emotional satisfaction remaining, and nobody can be trusted. Until, Winston meets a young woman named Julia. She, like Winston, has a carefree attitude towards the totalitarianism of The Party, and try to bring back the characteristics of what makes us human, by evading the thought police, and joining the underground opposition, ""The Brotherhood"", they realize that The Party is far more capable of containing someone physically, but it can drive every last distinguishable characteristic of what makes you able to call yourself human, every hope for self-questioning, and turning you into what everyone else under the control of The Party is: a mindless, faceless zombie, that will accept everything right in front of your eyes."

902,Hades,Disturbing and thought provoking!  An advisory narrative to enlighten society of the dangers of allowing governments to control aspects of our lives and the media to heighten their control.  As fresh today as it will be tommorow. 
903,Erin,"This book is my new favorite book. Eric Blair (or George Orwell as he chose to be called) is genius! The way he portrays the mindset in this whacked out society is fabulous. Even the main character, who has more of what we would consider a normal, logical way of viewing the world, has his moments that let us see just how absurd the society of the fiction 1984 is as view from today's society. That is the thing that makes this a timeless novel in 1949 Orwell worried the society he depicted would never come to fruition and today we can be thankful that it hasn't.Now for my opinion on the most important part of the book: the ending.I thought it was a perfect way to end the book. It is predictable yet unpredictable. This ending is exactly what the reader doesn't want yet exactly what it needs to be for George Orwell's point to stick."
904,Elbio,"Libro que haya estado prohibido. Da miedo las similitudes con la realidad en la que vivimos. La ilusión de la elección, la libertad, este libro rompe eso"
905,Neveen Helmi,"When admiration for a book goes beyond the limits of well-structured words, you are only left with one central idea, only one thing you gather yourself up to say. And in the case of 1984, the idea that haunted me while reading it for the second time is about cruelty. The roots of cruelty are embedded in the most devastating realization I came to reach by the end of the novel: that our saviors from this seeming invincible oppressive power that controls this world are our hearts not our minds, we prevail by impulsive sentiments not by rational thoughts, they can get to your mind by their sleazy, highly structured and organized tactics but they can't touch your heart. You came to realize that relieving conviction just to watch it destroyed, and it turns out they can do what you thought they are in capable of, they can get to you heart and then leave you all hollow…a shadow of a man. "
906,Erik,"This is the first time I read this in ages. I was familiar with its anti-authoritarianism, but I did not remember the more philosophical theme that emerges in Winston's talks with O'Brien. Basically, if truth is taken as relative and merely ""socially constructed"" without any referent to actual existence, then the man with the gun gets to determine ""what is truth"" for those without guns. Stray musings...1. If you think life under Ingsoc is terrible, those poor souls in Eastasia have to live under Death Worship, which sounds much worse.2. Could Oceania sustain itself? North Korea seems to have done it for 60+ years, but I have my doubts about whether a continental North Korea like Oceania could be viable, which ties in with...3. This is kind of weird to say in conjuction with the whole truth is relative theme, but it seems to be part of the horror of the novel that anything beyond Winston's immediate experience may be a lie. Are there three competing superpowers? Is the rest of the world really like Oceania? That is to say, how much of Goldstein's book, which tells Winston what he already knew, is true."
907,João,"Remarkable, astonishing, overwhelming, powerful! It really goes deep in how human minds can be manipulated through fear and pain, depicting a social and political system which is auto-manageable and above any personality. Even with more than 50 years, Orwell was able to predict in his utopian world, one of the most dangerous contributions of technology to our current days, the surveillance and loss of privacy. A must-read to everyone!"
908,Eric,"Imagine living in a world where everything you do from working to eating and even thinking is all controlled by the state. Where any hint of disobedience can be detected by the Thought police, your telescreen, and even your own children. Where a new language is implemented just to eliminate any words related to political rebellion. Where black is white, and 1+1=3 all is the state says so. Where the past is rewritten to strengthen the appearance of the state. Where the ""truth"" is what the state says it is.Imagine living in a world where WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTHThis is the reality of the main character, Winston Smith, a low-ranking party member of the ruling party in London. From the start, Winston has always disliked the party's ideals and has even illegally purchased a diary where he can express his criminal thoughts. As the story progresses, Winston starts to meet more characters who also share his same thoughts about the party.Overall, George Orwell does a spectacular job of creating a depressing horrific speculation of the future, one with such an engaging story line that pulls in the reader from the first page.I would highly recommend this book to whoever liked Animal Farm or anyone who particularly enjoys dystopias in general. "
909,Martin Kurniadi,"I know the book was good, but I never would have guessed wit would be this good.Starting from the first sentence, I immediately got hooked from the start, about the dystopian world Orwell created and made us believe, the political system and the higher power, which he explained in details. This felt like half-fiction, half-essay - you can always find arguments that Orwell wanted to prove, and along with those arguments, some look at the facts and examples. This book is more towards visionary attitude; Orwell speculated that in the future, to regain total control of human beings, the higher power has to do like this.Reading this towards the end, I begin to discern things - to gain a foothold, you lose a foothold. You can never have more than two beliefs. We as individuals are subconsciously turning, into power-driven or individualistic maniac looking for something to control. And where does that lead? What solution it needs?The answer: Stability and Order.That's where Big Brother came. Where what you say or do are known, watched behind the telescreens. The name registry, your job, your families - all will not know you are gone. The slogans have become fundamental belief of Big Brother:WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.Each has different meaning, and that's the core of INGSOC (English Society) in Orwell's world, the Big Brother who seemed to know everything. They use torture and fear to make them deny the reality and eventually, to see where they've been wrong. Fear is the central attention of control, and once they have it - they could alter the truth whatever they like.Highly recommended, especially if you wanted to know what could happen in the future, according to George Orwell. It was very interesting and the value it taught you are priceless."
910,Mariya,"Книга яка іноді розриває мозок від думок і дивування - як, ну як людина в середині 20 століття могла написати про те, що відбувається зараз???Книга, яку варто прочитати. І, думаю, не один раз. "
911,Helin,"Bu muhteşem distopyanın bir sosyalizm eleştirisinden çok, her anlamda bir uyarı ve endişe hikayesi olduğu bariz. Aslında çok daha başka amaçlarla yola çıkılan devrimlerin nasıl saptırıldığı, her defasında halkın -proleterlerin- kaybettiği ve iktidara sahip olan her kesimin bunu mutlaka kendi yararına kullandığını anlatan, eşsiz bir yapıt. Zamanının değil, her zamanın kitabı."
912,Stan,"Orwell is the closest thing to a prophet that I've ever read when it comes to fiction. His read of humanity, its probable course, and the likely consequences are not only stunning, but frightening. From spoofing communist Russia in ""Animal Farm"" to painting the chilling dystopia of 1984, Orwell has consistently impressed me with his wisdom and understanding.1984 didn't turn out the way Orwell's novel said it would, and yet, so many of the ideas posited in the novel have taken root in the society I live in--and that only 25 years after the book is set.Though they're not called ""Thought Police,"" the proponents of political correctness have done effectively the same thing. We see fulfillment of the scripture that speaks of people ""making a man an offender for a word,"" wherein I see demands for apologies and penance on far too regular a basis for my own liking, and often in response to slights that could readily be ignored by a more mature person. In one of his speeches at a college commencement, the late Charlton Heston spoke of a friend of his (I seem to recall it was a Congressman) who was forced to resigned because he used the word ""niggardly"" in his speech (which means ""shoddy"" or ""sloppy""), but because of ignorance on the part of the listeners, they automatically assumed he was making a deeply offensive racial slur, and when it was all over, he had lost his job.Telescreens aren't necessary in our modern-day version of ""1984"": we willingly plug ourselves into ""the tube"" to be fed a steady diet of marketing tripe, much of which we seem to buy without question, at least in my observations. Who needs to watch us all the time,without our consent, when we gladly tune in to what they want us to believe anyway? Heck, we'll even get our political views from comedians, these days (O'Brien, Colbert, etc.). Rewriting history isn't even necessary in our ""1984""--we don't even want to *know* it in the first place. Why waste the time trying to change it? Besides, even when you do bring forth historical evidences, I've seen it ignored or misinterpreted in many instances (I just read a 7th-Day Adventist column about opposing Prop 8, for instance, that used concubinage and past polygamous practices to try supporting the idea that marriage as historically a male-female relationship was specious and difficult to support without the bible).We have plenty of bureaucracy in place, just as Orwell's novel did. The division between the prols and the upper class isn't too different in 2009 than from what it was in ""1984"".The bottom line, I think, is this: Orwell seems to have known enough about our past to make a reasonably accurate prediction of our future. Let's face it, despite the technological advances since the dawn of the Industrial Age, humanity is still essentially the same as it was in the Stone Age, as far as behaviour goes. Isaac Asimov's Harry Seldon might have had what seemed a difficult job putting together the math for his predictions, but Orwell demonstrates that it doesn't take advanced math to know where the race, as a whole, will probably go. "
913,Alanood Burhaima," In this book, Orwell writes about Winston who lives in a world where the government brainwashes and manipulates the minds of their civilians. He later on falls in love with Julia and together, they hold to the belief that the party can never take away their love.[SPOILERS] In the end, when the party found out about Winston's relationship and his attempts against the government, they mentally/physically tortured him to an extent that he yelled to the party to do it for Julia instead, which proves how the govt is capable of controlling their minds [SPOILERS](Ok you can read now)This book has been challenged several times and it was actually banned in the ussr for its political themes and anti-communist ideas. It's kind of funny cuz whenever I read the word ""big brother"", I instantly think of Stalin bcs to me, they're very similar.Do I recommend this book?Yes, I recommend it though it could be depressing and you need to have a strong stomach to read it (I felt dizzy reading certain passages). Orwell purposely wrote this book to warn his readers about the dangers of a totalitarian regime and I personally think that it might happen but ANYWAYS....I highly encourage everyone to read it and if I remember correctly, it's available in the ZU library, so you can read the first few pages as a sample :)"
914,Anna Nelson,"Maybe I'm biased because this book setting takes place in April- my birthday month. Or it could be the description of Victory Mansions that give me the chills, in any case, 1994 by George Orwell is my all time favorite book. This book is so true to life that it's eerie. I wonder when Mr. Orwell wrote this book did he really predict by the year 2016 that BIG BROTHER would be watching us all, in reality. How could he forecast such a prediction?The Thought Police really did a number on my mind. I still have a problem having certain thoughts around people because I feel the wrong thought will be exposed. Not to mention, you can see ""The Ministry of Truth"" in this years 2016 elections for Presidency.. ""War is Peace"", ""Ignorance is Strength"" ""Freedom is Slavery"". If I didn't know any better I would assume that the Illuminati read this book and used it as their blue print for the New World Order.1984 will forever be the book that literally opened my eyes to a new realm"
915,Megan,"This book took me by surprise. I expected a dystopian society, but I didn't expect to feel personally invested in it. An shockingly imaginable and haunting reality. A few stunning lines: ""But the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him. The horror was that he might also be wrong."" ""Freedom is the freedom to say that 2 plus 2 equals 4. If that is granted, then all else follows."" ""The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you already know."" ""If you clung to the truth you were not mad.""""Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as understood."" ""What can you do against the lunatic more intelligent than yourself?"" Lessons to learn. "
916,Georgie Sinn,"I read the book at 14 and liked it. I was told beforehand that it's about a dystopian world, and it did deliver. I know the feeling of having to watch over your shoulders, or guarding your words carefully. But I was also into the love story between Winston and Julia. At the time, Sting's ""Fields of Gold"" was playing on in the background as I was reading, so I associate the two with each other. The book, like the song, was pretty sad. I personally always root for people like Julia, the kind of savvy girl who likes to make the world burn to burn away the bullsh*t."
917,Javier Sanjuan,"George Orwell realizó una disección descarnada de la historia política del hombre y de la opresión de los partidos totalitarios, desde una perspectiva tan lógica que me da escalofríos el pensar que tal posibilidad todavía es viable. Creo que, al final, si queremos evitar una situación cómo la expuesta en este libro debemos replantear nuestras indagaciones históricas y volver a buscar la respuesta a la pregunta: ¿Es posible un mundo en el que seamos iguales y en el que todos tengamos que comer sin tener que pagar por ello con nuestra dignidad? "
918,Moaz Mohamed,".. مسك الختام لعام 2014 
 كنت قد قررت قراءة هذه الرواية في أبريل الماضي .. إنشغلت بالروايات الأخرى حتى قرأت خبر القبض على شاب بسبب هذه الرواية وهو ما شجعني للبدء في قرائتها .. وكنت مخطئًا لإني تأخرت كل هذا الوقت
ربما لو كان جورج أورويل حاضرًا في عام 1984 أو حتى في هذا الوقت .. لما إستطاع صياغة رواية بهذه القوة حيث أنه كتبها عام 1949 أي قبل 35 عام من 1984 لكنه كان حاضرًا بعقله ليعلم ماذا سيحث مستقبلًا .. .. طوال الرواية لم أعرف شخصية الأخ الأكبر .. لكني قارنتها بحسني مبارك في مصر .. القذافي في ليبيا وآل الأسد في سوريا .. وحتى كيم جونغ أون رئيس كوريا الشمالية .. 
.. والذي طبق قواعد الأخ الأكبر وحزبه على شعبه .. لدرجة أنه أقنعهم بأن منتخبهم الوطني فاز بكأس العالم 2006 !! بعدما فرض رقابة على كل وسائل الإعلام .. أحداث الرواية مشوقة جدًا .. تلمس كل البلاد العربية بلا إستثناء .. ..يجب أن تعيش وأنت مؤمن أنك عبد للأخ الأكبر .. أن تعيش وأنت تدرك أنه سيد هذا العالم .. أن تعيش دون ماضي لأن الأخ الأكبر يتحكم في الماضي .. 
.. لدرجة أنك يجب أن تتحكم في إنفعالاتك وتعبيرات وجهك لئلا تلتقطها شاشة الرصد .. بإختصار الأخ الأكبر يراقبك

التاريخ يُعاش ويُحفظ ولا يُكتب .. فالمطابع يملكها المنتصرون.. في كل صفحة من هذه الرواية ستخرج بإقتباس على الأقل .. الرواية كلها جمل واقعية بدرجة سوداوية ..  1""إننا ندرك أنه ما من أحد يمسك بزمام السلطة وهو ينتوى التخلى عنها. إن السلطة ليست وسيلة بل غاية، فالمرء لا يقيم حكما استبداديا لحماية الثورة، وإنما يشعل الثورة لإقامة حكم استبدادى. إن الهدف من الاضطهاد هو الاضطهاد، والهدف من التعذيب هو التعذيب وغاية السلطة هى السلطة"" 2فقال ونستون وهو ينتحب: ""وماذا عساى أن أفعل؟ كيف يمكننى أن أتجنب رؤية ما هو أمام عينى؟ إن اثنين واثنين يساويان أربعة"".فقال أوبراين: ""أحيانا يساويان أربعة يا ونستون، وأحيانا أخرى يساويان خمسة وقد يساويان ثلاثة أيضا، وفى أحيان أخرى يساويان أربعة وخمسة وثلاثة فى آن معا. يجب أن تحاول بمزيد من الجدية والجهد، فليس من السهل أن تصبح سليم العقل""3 “وإذا استطاع المرء أن يشعر بأن بقاءه أنساناً هو أمر يستحق التضحية من أجله, حتى لو لم يُؤد ذلك إلى نتيجة, فإنه يكون قد ألحق بهم الهزيمة” .. لكن ما لم يتنبأ به جورج أورويل هو نجاح الثورات نسبيًا ووعي العامة لضرورة القيام بثورة لعزل الأخ الأكبر ؛ لأنه عندما يكون الظلم واقعًا .. تكون الثورات حقًا مشروعًا ..
.. للأسف .. هذه الرواية تنطبق على مصر بدرجة كبيرة جدًا 
.. الأخ الأكبر كان الملك فاروق وبوليسه .. وعبد الناصر ومراكز القوى ومن ثم السادات ومن بعده مبارك وجهاز أمن الدولة وماسبيرو .. لأنه في مصر يسجدالشعب لإلهين .. إله في السماء وإله على عرش مصر .. للأسف .. الإعلام المصري مدافعًا عن الأخ الأكبر 
.. إذا أردت إختصار الوقت وتوفير المال - وتضييع المتعة - بدلاً من قراءة الرواية .. ما عليك سوى السير في شوارع مصر الآن  هذه رواية صادمة فعلاً ؛ لأنها أخبرت عن حياة العديد من الشعوب والبلدان .. وشرحت بشكل وافٍ كيف يمكن أن تعيش الشعوب في ظل الديكتاتورية والبطش دون أن يفهموا ما يدور حولهم بل وربما نجدهم يؤيدون ويهللون لكل قرار يصدر من النظام الحاكم حتى ولو كان هذا القرار ضدهم .. عندما قرأتها فهمت لماذا تأخرت ثورات الربيع العربي وغيرها من الثورات على الصعيد العالمي .. الآن أدركت أن مؤيدي الأنظمة هم المادة الخام للغباء والعبودية على مر الزمان .. فلا تسأل الطغاة لماذا طغوا .. ولكن إسأل العبيد لماذا ركعوا تذكرت أثناء قراءة هذه الرواية أنني - وبعد أحداث 30\6\2013 - فوجئت بشخص يحتضنني .. إستغرق الأمر مني بضع لحظات حتى أدركت أنه شيخ مسجدنا .. قام بحلق لحيته خشية الإعتقال ولم أتعرف عليه خصوصًا أنه كان كث اللحية .. فإن إِعتُقِل الفرد في مصر سيجد آلافًا مؤلفة تهلل لمجرد القبض عليه .. أتمنى أن نخرج من هذه الرواية قريبًا .. رغم أن كل المعطيات تؤكد أننا سنمكث طويلاً في إنتظار الخروج من هذه الرواية التي نعيشها يوميًا .. "
919,Writer's Relief,"A terrifyingly delightful read! 1984 follows its main character, Winston Smith, as he trudges through the monotony of his life. 1984, published in 1948, is a foreshadowing of a future dystopian English society.Divided into three major powers—Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia—the earth is dominated by tyrannical dictatorships eternally at war with one another. Winston is a member of the political party of Oceania, living in England. A quick peek into his world paints a horrifying image of life under a totalitarian regime: Every move he makes is monitored by a large television screen in his flat, he works for the government as a rewriter of historical documents to suit the needs of the Party, and happiness is all but absent.The novel takes a turn when Winston meets Julia, a young woman whom he sexually desires. The two begin a relationship in secret that, if discovered, could mean certain death for the two lovers. Winston’s slow ascent to revolutionary continues as he keeps a journal, also in secret, to document all his feelings and desires. The tension rises later in the novel as Winston and Julia’s affair is eventually brought to light. It is there we see the true evil of the Party, as the lovers are tortured by their greatest fears. The sight of true horror is finally revealed at the novel’s conclusion: Even in the most passionate of souls, the mind can still be changed so thoroughly as to believe two plus two equals five."
920,Evey,"2015 Reading Challenge - A book with a number in the titleI had this book on my TBR pile for a long time and I finally picked it up and took my time to read it. It took over a month for me to complete this read for one reason: you can't read it in a rush.This book is thought provoking and it's impossible to avoid comparing our society to the one portrayed in 1984. It made me reflect, re-think, discuss and theorize about today's society and what will come. How far ar we from a government like the on portrayed in this book? Aren't we already controlled? Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and all the social media are making our private life public for all to see, and the industry is already taking advantage from it. How long will it take for the government to use it on its own benefit? Even, aren't they already doing so?All in all, George Orwell is a must read for those who are up to read about a critical view of past, present, and a yet to reveal future. Don't expect just another light dystopia. And remember...BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU."
921,Luke Burrage,Full review on my podcast. Check out SFBRP #113. I should have made this one episode #101. Oh well.I reviewed Halting State by Charles Stross in second person present tense. Should I try to review this entirely in new-speak? 
922,Vladislav,"Utterly and unrepentingly bleak, '1984' paints a dystopian landscape that, in all the everlasting power of its narrative, sits uncomfortably at the back of your head, whispering: 'To some degree, this is happening to you right now.' Under the looming shadow of its political message - at different stages of the story and across various chapters - '1984' explores a vast landscape of human emotion: disgust, rebellion, sexuality, despair. But above all, the unfathomable depths of human pain - from the lingering discomfort of a society gone wrong to the purest, helpless humiliation. A disturbing, provocative and gut-wrenching read."
923,Sophie,"WOW. Everyone needs to read this book. I understand how someone could think it's slightly intimidating, but this is one of the best thought provoking books I have ever read. I'm really disappointed that I put off reading it for so long, now I just need to read the rest of Orwell's books. "
924,Anthony," From Wikipedia: ""Thematically Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and Animal Farm (1945) share the betrayed revolution; the person's subordination to the collective; rigorously enforced class distinctions (Inner Party, Outer Party, Proles); the cult of personality; concentration camps; Thought Police; compulsory regimented daily exercise and youth leagues. Oceania resulted from the U.S. annexation of the British Empire to counter the Asian peril to Australia and New Zealand. It is a naval power whose militarism venerates the sailors of the floating fortresses, from which battle is given to recapturing India, the ""Jewel in the Crown"" of the British Empire. Much of Oceanic society is based upon the U.S.S.R. under Joseph Stalin—Big Brother; the televised Two Minutes' Hate is ritual demonisation of the enemies of the State, especially Emmanuel Goldstein (viz Leon Trotsky); altered photographs create unpersons deleted from the national historical record."" This should be read back to back with Solzhenitsyn's THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO. Also worth reading is Isaac Asimov's review of it in its entirety.Excerpts from Asimov's review of 1984:""That book described society as a vast world-wide extension of Stalinist Russia in the 1930s, pictured with the venom of a rival left-wing sectarian.Other forms of totalitarianism play a small role. There are one or twomentions of the Nazis and of the Inquisition. At the very start, there is a reference or two to Jews, almost as though they were going to prove the objects of persecution, but that vanishes almost at once, as though Orwell didn't want readers to mistake the villains for Nazis.The picture is of Stalinism, and Stalinism only.By the time the book came out in 1949, the Cold War was at its height.The book therefore proved popular."" ""It was most popular at first with people who leaned towards theconservative side of the political spectrum, for it was clearly ananti-Soviet polemic, and the picture of life it projected in the London of 1984 was very much as conservatives imagined life in the Moscow of 1949 to be."""" Orwell, however, had no time for either Mussolini or Hitler. His enemy was Stalin, and at the time that 1984 was published, Stalin had ruled the Soviet Union in a ribbreaking bear hug for twenty-five years, had survived a terrible war in which his nation suffered enormous losses and yet was now stronger than ever. To Orwell, it must have seemed that neither time nor fortune could budge Stalin, but that he would live on forever with ever increasing strength. - And that was how Orwell pictured Big Brother.Of course, that was not the way it really was. Orwell didn't live longenough to see it but Stalin died only three years after 1984 was published,and it was not long after that that his regime was denounced as a tyranny by - guess who - the Soviet leadership.""""Orwell imagines Great Britain to have gone through a revolution similarto the Russian Revolution and to have gone through all the stages thatSoviet development did. He can think of almost no variations on the theme.The Soviets had a series of purges in the 1930s, so the Ingsoc (EnglishSocialism) had a series of purges in the 1950s. The Soviets converted one of their revolutionaries, Leon Trotsky, into avillain, leaving his opponent, Joseph Stalin, as a hero. The Ingsoc,therefore, convert one of their revolutionaries, Emmanuel Goldstein, into avillain, leaving his opponent, with a moustache like Stalin, as a hero.There is no ability to make minor changes, even. Goldstein, like Trotsky,has 'a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and asmall goatee beard'. Orwell apparently does not want to confuse the issue bygiving Stalin a different name so he calls him merely 'Big Brother'.""Isaac Asimov's review of 1984:http://www.newworker.org/ncptrory/198...* Not having to do with any review of this book, but as an aside: Hilariously, most people I know DON'T REALIZE this book is largely based on Soviet Russia. I can't count how many times I've heard social liberals who count this book among their favorites exclaim in subdued conspiratorial whispers how much 1984 seems to be like a prophetic novel about George W. Bush's eight years in office. Meanwhile, Bush Jr.'s Keynesian economics (exactly the same as that which Obama advocates) and big government neo-conservatism (neo-conservatism is center-right and only slightly distinguishable from social liberalism) has very little to do with the USSR and communism. One social liberal who harbored a rabid hatred of Dubya I knew even listed Stalin as among people whom she admired yet after having read 1984, she exclaimed that 1984 was terrifyingly similar to Dubya's vision of America. It is difficult for me to take the idea of Bush Jr (or Obama for that matter) being totalitarian dictators seriously."

Winston, un trabajador cualquiera, se va dando cuenta poco a poco que el partido no es en realidad lo que le hace creer a la gente, y lo que en realidad busca es quitar todo pensamiento racional y acabar con el pensamiento liberal de los individuos. La rebelión al sistema no es una opción, puesto que el Gobierno tiene vigiladas la ciudad entera tele pantallas, asegurándose así que nadie se rebele al sistema absolutista que en realidad gobierna a Londres en 1984.

929,Eliu Preciado,"George Orwell's 1984 kept me in awe. This book was astounding. It left me speechless several times. The novel was well written and kept me wanting more. The cruel reality of their situation was well written. This book made me want more. One of the major themes in this story is power. The government has too much power and they’re using the power to oppress the citizens. They are ruled by a totalitarianism government. The citizens have no control over their lives therefore losing individuality. Individuality is what makes a person unique. If the government has too much power they are bound to abuse it.This story is written in third person limited omniscient. This point of view gives off the feel of what is going on and helps you further understand the situation. The experience wouldn’t be the same without this point of view. The characters are well written and would be believable as real people. The rebellious and the oppressors. “Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.” In this quote Winston explains that people who are not aware of there surroundings are blind. He is the man who refuses to cooperate with the Party. The story is set in the near future Oceania. The setting of this story is the government rules with totalitarianism. Unlike them we have freedom. They are forced to conform and lose their right to individuality. You can imagine the poor living condition and the constant war going on. They lose their sense of privacy and are forced to be watched. Just imagine a place where living conditions are poor, rations, being watched all the time, and losing everything that makes you unique.Winston Smith is a low ranked member of the Party. The Party keeps watch of all the citizens. The face of the party is known as Big Brother. They want everyone to follow what they say. So they decide to make them learn a thing called Newspeak. This prevents rebellious thoughts. If they were to have thoughts of rebellions they would be treated as criminals and punished. Winston refuses to follow the Party and decides to do what he wants. In this story you see his choices and the paths he chooses seeing the outcomes of his choices. I believe that this book does not have any connections with ones I have read so far. The only things that I might have read about is the government abusing power.This book was well written and I enjoyed the horrific reality of their situation. I would recommend this book to people who want a story they would never want to put down with a well written plot and well developed characters. "
930,Austin Catania,"	In George Orwell’s novel 1984, the life of a totalitarian nation called Oceania comes forth. The main Character Winston carries out his everyday life in the horrid traditions the nations holds dear. Overall I enjoyed the book because of its complex nature and detail, but was horrified by its eerie fictional society. Never the less it is a fantastic novel that opens your eyes and creates reason to question your government. It shows that maybe the everyday activities that you do isn’t necessarily justified or morally correct. Orwell warns against the dangers of authoritarianism. The story even goes to the extent to show that in this nation one cannot state or think anything negative of the ruling party. Orwell uses Winston who kind of a socialist to open the readers eyes. Throughout the novel Oceania is constantly fighting with the other two super states. This encapsulates the theme of war being necessary. Without war big brother would lose control over the people. They party and big brother also loves manipulation, for they use it to control not only the future, but also the past and present. Over all I Give the novel a 5/5, while horrific, it was thought provoking. Always remember “Big Brother is Watching You” (Orwell 2)."
931,Dante Paniccia,"1984 Book Review11 December 2014In the world of 1984 “If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.” While the year 1984 may be long behind us, the messages and themes in 1984 are still as relevant as ever, maybe even more so today. 1984 talks about a dystopian future. In this alternate future Great Britain is governed by a totalitarian government in which no one is allowed to have their own opinions, love anyone or even have close friends. The government is supposedly run by someone by the name of Big Brother. He watches everything the citizens do at all times, while on the street, while at work and even when they're in there own homes. The streets are littered with posters with the phrase “Big Brother is Watching You.” written on them. The London of 1984 is very dull and depressing: there are excessive amounts of poverty, missiles hit the city from time to time and everything is very old and dirty except for these large pyramid-shaped government structures that are placed in random parts around the city. The story centers around a man named Wilson who works for the government and lives a very depressing existence with no friends and no one to love. He hates how the government is run so he starts to write a diary to get out all of this built up rage and frustration even though writing a diary is illegal in Wilson’s world. Overall I thought the book was very entertaining and that the original premise was fantastic. I think that the problems faced in this book speak more to people today because we can see clear similarities between how our government spies on us and how the government in the book went about doing it. Although it takes awhile to get to a point in the book where things start to pick up, and the book does tend to drag on at times, I still think the overall story and the surprise ending completely makes up for it. I definitely would recommend this book, not only lovers of science fiction but also to anyone who loves a well-thought-out story that most can relate to. "
932,Carlos,"I must say I have read this book twice: first in Spanish and then in English. The first time I read it, I was around 16 years old, I had to read it when I was in high school. Then, I read it again 3-4 years ago, and I have to say that I really loved it! This book is definitely among my 5 favourite books ever! I loved the story (Despite it is sad), the plot is perfect and I admired Orwell when I ""met"" Winston Smith. That character is perfect, maybe he is like us: a normal guy, kind of silly, kind of intelligent sometimes... but it is just marvellous how he struggled against the Big Brother... And the end, holy cow... I LOVED THE END! I am pretty sure I cried when I was reading the last 2 pages of the book. What a story, what a climax, what a context, what a message!"

935,Smahdi Moosavi,یکی از بهترین رمانهایی که در ژانر سیاست خوانده ام.
936,Shubhi Agarwal,"There was a reason I was putting off writing a review for this book, simply because one just can't write about it with a half mind or without organizing the Tyndall-effect like agitation it creates in your mind. I had the same feeling after reading Animal Farm, but this book takes it few notches higher.This story set some 50 years in future (from the time Orwell wrote it), depicts a dystopian world, where the ruling party (depicted as an ever-watching, all-knowing Big Brother's eyes) has such tremendous control over the lives of the masses, that they have no freedom to do as they will, or even think as they please. The people are monitored at all times by the Telescreens put up by the ruling party, which serves as a TV to instruct people, and a camera to monitor their activities. Every form of expression, or any possible means of deriving pleasure is termed as prohibited. All the history, philosophy and literature is modified, in a way the party wants them to be.This novel depicts the heights of Totalitarianism, when the government controls and has the power to change people's thoughts and ideas, by all possible physical, mental or emotional means. So, when a certain Winston and Julia decide to rebel against the party, they go through unimaginable pains, and their extremes are tested. I will not reveal the end, in the fear of killing the book for you, but this story is so powerful, that it won't be surprising if you get nightmares while/after reading it. This book is like a social fiction, cautionary tale which makes you think, what if this comes true...A super strong recommendation to each who wants to read something worthwhile, and huge respect for George Orwell."
937,Tristan Knight,"Tristan Knight 6/5/151984 ReviewOften times, there’s nothing more invigorating than a good old-fashioned dystopian piece. Whether to gain insight into the flaws of humanity or to simply feel better about where we currently are as a society, there is a certain sensation that can only be provided by a dark, cynical story of the future. George Orwell's 1984 covers all the aspects of a quality dystopian novel, each with a unique twist that sets it apart from the innumerable works that crowd the genre: the individual with a tense inner conflict, the omniscient and omnipotent overpower, and a plot to undermine the grand authority. With his masterful writing, Orwell crafts a thought-invoking work of great impact in the literary realm.The most prevalent feature of 1984 is the conflict within the main character's mind. This novel is one all about sacrifice and concealing one's true intentions; where even thinking negatively is a capital crime, the slightest twitch of the finger can mean the difference between life or death. The protagonist surmises it very well in the following excerpt:Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your nervous system. At any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom. (Orwell)Such a predicament creates a whole new area of distress; besides knowing that he has already broken the law himself, there is the clear possibility that Smith can be arbitrarily killed without thinking anything. It resonates in the audience personal fears of being in similar positions, such as no longer having their own thoughts remain private, or being in a position where one cannot defend themselves from a potentially life-threatening allegation. Beyond this, the protagonist must dodge constant television surveillance, plainclothes spies, militarized children, and actual followers of the government. Smith's life is under constant scrutiny, and the reader's investment in his success faces off against the seemingly insurmountable odds against him even being able to express his dissatisfaction to another, nonetheless spur an entire revolution. Such a tense situation presented to the main character creates an interesting and suspenseful read sure to keep one on the edge of their seat.The second part that makes 1984 such a phenomenal piece is its unique oppressor in the Party. They go far beyond the normal dystopian ""big brother"" government (indeed, the term big brother is derived from this book itself), employing dastardly and inhuman tactics to keep its citizens in line. Most crimes are met with extensive physical and psychological torture, followed by an often delayed execution. The expectations the Party places upon its citizens are also ridiculous to the point of being on the edge of plausibility, yet just possible enough to allow the reader to fully grasp the extent of the madness at hand:""You are a slow learner, Winston.""""How can I help it? How can I help but see what is in front of my eyes? Two and two are four.""""Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once. You must try harder. It is not easy to become sane."" (Orwell)In this quote, the question is literal. The torturer truly desires Winston to believe that two plus two equals whatever his superior says it does. Such a scenario is fantastic enough to be clearly fiction while just plausible enough to seem like a potential future. Already, there are corporations issuing gag orders and groups like the Church of Scientology notorious for drawing its followers into a ridiculous lifestyle and beliefs.	Of course, there wouldn’t be much point in reading a story where the protagonist flatly accepts society the way it is. The plot against the system, although rather slow at the beginning, advances rapidly and forcefully as the piece approaches the middle. It is set apart from other pieces in the subtlety, secrecy, and fear behind it. With the strict adherence demanded by the Party, the audience is constantly reminded of the troubles faced by one who tries to face off against the higher powers. The futility felt by Winston is perhaps best depicted in the following excerpt from his journal:	“April the 4th, 1984. To the past, or to the future. To an age when thought is free. From the Age of Big Brother, from the Age of the Thought Police, from a dead man - greetings!” (Orwell)Although his conviction is clear - he readily assumes that there will be a future in which his writing is read, and that that future will be one of freedom - he is also convinced that he has been sentenced to death upon penning such a statement. This is not far from the truth; with the knowledge of the society that has arisen in this novel, such a simple act as writing one’s true thoughts in a book is one of the bravest things that can be done. There is not much that can be easily done in the way of groups of people; the all seeing government ascertains as much as that. But watching the protagonist make small personal victories against them becomes infinitely more riveting when the bar for execution is set at considering such a course of action. As Winston sets his eyes on higher goals, the plot becomes more and more tense, and the efficiency with which it builds suspense off of the most minor of accomplishments is truly something to be applauded.A good dystopian novel is often hard to come by. The genre is flooded with everything from angsty teen dramas to glorified Mary Sue fanfictions. With such a huge market and vast distribution in writing quality, it can take some time to find a good read. Luckily, the search must go no further. George Orwell's 1984 is an amazing piece that contains both a suspenseful conflict, a thought evoking Big Brother government organization, and a riveting plot that will carry the reader through any rainy day or bout of boredom. If a solid piece regarding human nature and societal flaws is what’s desired, 1984 should be the primary choice."
938,Gary Dolman,"The first book I ever read that made me weep, (other than nursery stories when I was little), was Animal Farm. 1984 had as profound an effect 40 years later. To my shame, I had never this classic until now.Of course it is a monumental work and I cannot add much to that already written, but what did strike me was how much of the Party's methods were used in modern British politics, and most particularly since 2010; the re-writing of history, the surveillance, the presentation of onerous changes as somehow wholesome.I now have the glorious Huxley classic Brave New World to read, and to compare and contrast."

É inevitável supor que daqui em diante sempre que ler uma distopia terei que a comparar com este livro, e que muito provavelmente irei achar que não chega aos calcanhares deste.

O livro é simultaneamente original, surpreendente, cativante e profundo, quatro adjectivos que não uso frequentemente para descrever um livro, muito menos todos eles em conjunto. ""Freedom is slavery"", a liberdade de sermos escravos da realidade que não existe senão dentro da mente de cada um, num presente que define em simultâneo o passado e o futuro. "
942,11,"Heads up!Let me be up-front admitting that this is one of those self-absorbed reviews that doesn't tell you much about the book itself, but rather my experience reading it. So much has been written about the contents and significance of 1984, I don't think I can add much there. I write about how it affected me because it did. A lot. And I remain grateful to George Orwell for writing it.-Thanks also to Ceridwen, for the Listopia link that got me thinking about rewriting this review today.1984 affected me profoundly. It's no exaggeration to say I think about it nearly every day. Yet that's all I wrote about it in my original review? Why is that? I'm not sure. It's one of the ""Big Books"" (capitalized, but without quotation marks in my mind) in my life. One of the top four or five which touched me in some way which transcends the conventional reading experience. I'm not a very fast reader, so I can count the number of books on one hand that I've completely read cover-to-cover in one sitting. 1984 is among them. I was fourteen years old on Christmas of 1983, and somebody (I forget who) decided that with 1984 just around the corner, Orwell's work would be a good Christmas present for me. A few days later, with the luxury of ample Christmas break free time on my hands, I started in on it. I was home alone all day, and devoured the book. Afterwards, I just lay on my bed staring at the ceiling for like twenty minutes, digesting its contents in my parents' silent home, my room bathed in the anemic light of late afternoon in winter, which somehow reinforced the power of Orwell's dark vision. The experience hadn't been like reading a book at all. It had been like opening a message in a bottle. A message Orwell had scrawled off thirty-five years earlier, and then cast into an ocean of media and ideas whose unpredictable currents had somehow ended with me. It wasn't a prophecy, as in ""These things will come to pass"". It was a receipt for Orwell's thoughts, which were now being whispered to me across time and from beyond the grave: ""Brian, I thought these things, and that means other people can think them too. I wrote this in 1948, when Hitler still seemed real. You live in a world where he doesn't seem real anymore, but he was real. He wasn't the only one with a horrible plan."" The mere existance of Orwell's dystopic story proved that it was important. Standing on the cusp of a paradigm shift for months, this little push was all I needed. There was a flutter in my stomach. There really is a monster in the attic. The call really is coming from inside the house.My interest and knowledge of history at that time was minimal. School had taught me the standard fare about the Pilgrims and Indians, Lincoln freeing the slaves, and World War I killing 16 million people because a virtually unknown archduke (is that like a prince?) was assassinated. Everything else I knew had been powerfully drummed into me by my party-line patriotic, Republican-leaning, economically abused blue collar family and hometown. The political narrative I received in childhood went something like: 
America are the good guys who always fight countries like the USSR and the Third Reich, who treat their citizens poorly. Well, we treat black people poorly, and probably other people too, but not as bad as Hitler treated Jews; plus, things are getting better now. (well, the worst parts of Buffalo do have a lot of black people living there, so it doesn't really look like things are getting better for them, but that's what everybody says) Anyhow, everything was fine until Jimmy Carter got into the White House and screwed things up so badly that my father got laid off and eventually lost his job at a company in Buffalo that made industrial presses. (another thing which had an enduring impact on me)
 There was probably a little more to my worldview then, but not much more, and those were the highlights. I don't really want to debate the merits of my perspectives at age fourteen; the point is only that I embraced a sort of sanitized, black-and-white, star-spangled American exceptionalism mixed with Hollywood happy endings which didn't quite ring true in the face of actual evidence from my own life. Before you fire up your keyboards to tell me ""Sorry about your Dad's job, but Jimmy Carter isn't Big Brother"", let me clarify that I didn't and do not think he is. 1984 didn't speak to me directly about my family's finances or Jimmy Carter, but merely crystallized the vague notion that had been swimming around in my head that maybe all the lauded institutions around me were not necessarily designed with my personal Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness in mind. Lest you think that 1984 made me suddenly think I had all the answers to history and social injustice, let me assure you I didn't. Orwell shocked me, but didn't turn me overnight into a... well, into anything. I started reading a lot more about history after that, and changed course in my thinking more times than I can remember. I guess 1984 made me more curious and engaged in current events, more critical in my thinking, and more skeptical of authority. That's all Orwell did for me, and I can't imagine an author doing more for a reader than that. ...It is twenty-seven years later, and Orwell is all around me, as ubiquitous as the air. His whispered warnings have become shouts, which remain (it seems) mostly unheeded. Whereas my initial response to 1984 was a vague unease and a drive to examine the mechanations of history and politics, my present-day response is a much more specific and literal recognition of the many ways Winston Smith's world mirrors my own. Analogies to 1984 pop up every single day, painful and uninvited, but irrefutable and obstinate. If you search the phrase ""police taser citizen"" on YouTube, you'll get enough results to occupy the next solid week watching them all. It's called ""pain compliance"" in law enforcement circles. (See? -it's not brutality!) Since the PATRIOT ACT was passed, America has collectively consented to waive its privacy, allowing our phones and computers to be warrantlessly surveilled at any time and without notice. The terrorists these laws were supposed to be for don't live here. These laws are for us. We talk about waterboarding and secret renditions as matter-of-factly as we would discuss gardening. We are in the ninth year of an apparently unending ""War on Terror"" against Islamic extremism. We've always been at war with Islamic extremists. (except when they were our friends against the Soviets in 1979)There really is a monster in the attic. The call really is coming from inside the house.Am I oversimplifying some of these things? I know some of you are just dying to tell me that I am. Go ahead. It won't change the fact that Orwell has never been more relevant than he is today, and there may never be a more important book in my life than 1984."
943,فاتن,فلسفة سياسية اجتماعية اقتصادية في قالب روائي، أحيانا أتمنى أن أقتبس منها عبارات أشعر أنها مسلّمات وقوانيين ثابتة وأطروحات وجيهة غير أني أدرك لاحقا أن كل مايمت للأدب بصلة لايتم تقييمه بالصواب والخطأ بل بالحسن والقبح، فهذا هو المعيار الذي تنقد فيه كل الأعمال الأدبية، وعلى هذا فالرواية حسنة جدا وإن كانت تحوي بين جنبيها نظريات خاطئة.
944,Will M.,"*You can also find my reviews here: https://killerscorpion.wordpress.comWriting a review of a famous and important novel is always tough. 1984 is considered one of the greatest novels out there, and I have to agree on that. This thought provoking novel exceeded my expectations. It delivered not only enjoyment, but also knowledge. 1984 is about Orwell's vision of the future. Some view this as a warning of what could happen to the world in the future if we don't make a stand. This dystopian novel is thrilling because Orwell is correct. All the symbolisms are spot on, and some of the terrifying ones are only about to come our way. I'm well aware of the controversies he tackled on, but this still helped become an eye opener. I have to admit that the writing is a bit outdated. 1984 was first published in 1949 and it's a forgivable trait. It's not even considered a flaw back then, and most people don't even consider it as such today.We have Winston Smith as our main character in this novel. He works for the Ministry of Truth as a clerk. He has a wife, but they don't live together. They don't even see each other anymore. In the monotonous world that he lives in, no one knows that he is against the power. In a world where everyone worships a higher power, there will always be a few who will rebel. Winston is one of those rebels, but he doesn't know how to fight the power. He is afraid, just like everyone else.The situation Winston is in could be compared to a lot of things in the modern world. The afterword of Erich Fromm in this 60th anniversary edition further widened my knowledge of the novel. It's true that Orwell didn't say that these things will surely happen, but this is a warning for the readers. I understand now why this is considered one of those banned books. It's because this novel seeks to inform the readers of the truth. The truth scares people, especially those who will get exposed. I was assigned to read this novel back in third year high school, I was 15 years old then, and I hated anything that was assigned in school. I read about two to three chapters of this and ended up closing this novel and read something else. My mind wasn't interested in the topics that Orwell discussed here, but now I'm regretting having done such atrocity. I can't believe it took me 5 years to realize my mistake. It took me that long to finally pick this up again and see what was all the fuss about. Being 15 isn't an excuse for my ignorance. I have a huge amount of important novels to read soon, and I'm glad that I can finally tick this one off my list. I will read this again though, because I enjoyed reading it. It didn't feel like a textbook, or an online article, but it was a novel. Simply a novel with an interesting plot, well-developed characters, and thought provoking ideas. I will admit that 1984 made me feel a lot intimidated before I read it. I was in such a condition because I feared that I wouldn't fully grasp the essence of the novel. I felt that I wouldn't understand the real purpose why the author wrote this. I decided not to chicken out and read it anyway. I'm glad that I saw what Orwell wanted to depict, or at least most critical explanations backed up the thoughts I had after reading this. I decided to think about what I really felt and learned about the novel before reading someone else's opinion of it.I didn't write much about the plot because this isn't a chapter by chapter analysis of the novel. This is a review of my journey into 1984. You can find hundreds on explanation online about the novel, and I suggest you check them out if you want to understand the novel more. I hate spoilers, and I won't be the guy who will spoil this novel for potential readers of this review who haven't read the novel. For high school students, please don't rely solely on sparknotes or whatever online analysis you can find, because it would rob you of the enjoyment that you would feel after reading this.I've had some warnings stating that this novel is depressing, and not enjoyable. I consider that as ignorance. You can't forever steer clear of these novels and divulge in happy ever after plots. You have to see the truth behind what happened, what's happening, and what could happen. I'm not criticizing people who don't read classics, but I'm annoyed at those who will recommend skipping such novels because they consider them depressing, profane, and Stalin-like. Just my two-cents, you don't have to take it if you're one of those people. Like I said, I'm just annoyed, I'm not trying to attack you.After reading this, I felt as if there is still hope for the human race. The terrible things hasn't happened yet, and although it could still happen in the near future, I believe mankind can still prevent that from happening. First thing we need to do is inform, and then act on it. We can't live in a world like Oceania, it will drive us insane.5/5 stars. Truly spectacular. I enjoyed every page of the novel, and I will surely read this again in the future. "

946,Ricardo Baptista,"A book about Eric Arthur Blair's fight with insanity, it could also be about social control and politics and god and being human and...everything. When you start to read the book and the protagonist's interrogation you start to see that maybe this is hitting a little to close to home, our own and the author's. A twisted mirror vision of society chillingly not very far from our own."

949,Teresa," This book made me think about all the different human excuses and reasons we give ourselves to live. But the point that winston the main character makes when being tortured to abandon his free-will and not think for himself was when asked How do you know you exist. He says I do exist i am here I am now and I know I exist because no two objects can occupy the same space at the same time. That part of the book was by far the part that made me think the most. Not that all the points made about free-will and the ability to avoid authority didn't equally make me think. But one of the most frequently asked questions of humanity is Who am I? and Why do I exist? And as much as we ask those questions it does not change the fact that we are here. We occupy the space we are in, and no matter what reasons we give ourselves it does not change the fact that we are here and we are the person we are. 1984 made me wonder when given the choice to be ignorant, or to have the ability to think for yourself which one would someone chose? As painful as knowing is, knowing is what makes us live... George Orwell may not have answered these questions, but in my opinion in a way he trully did capture the idea of existance..."

952,Rowena," “Everything faded into mist. The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth.”  - George Orwell, 1984It’s been over 5 years since I last read 1984 and I still find the storyline as horrific as ever. It's terrifying to think of a world in which your own children are spies for the government and can turn you in, where cameras are watching you 24/7, where one could be accused of committing a ""facecrime"" or having an ""ownlife"", a world in which we live nervously worrying about whether the sensitive machinery that is watching you will pick up an increase in heartbeat that may incriminate us.When I first read this book I imagined a similar dystopic world taking place in a Communist country or perhaps in a dictatorship like the one so many of my relatives were raised in. Now I realize it could just as well take place in a so-called democracy under several guises, and that’s the scary part. My mind did wander quite a bit while I was reading this book, thinking of the eerie possibilities, trying to find parallels between what I was reading and what I was observing in society. We are witnessing so much propaganda which may not be as obvious as some of the hilarious pro-Stalin and pro-Mao posters that I’ve seen online and in history books, but it’s there in an often subtler form.I think one of the scariest parts for me was seeing how language can be used to manipulate and control:  “All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory.’ Reality control’, they called it: in Newspeak, ‘doublethink.’ Language is definitely becoming more simplified and some of the words that are making it into the dictionary are just laughable.I kept thinking about the following Virginia Woolf quote while reading this book: “Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind.”  - Virginia Woolf, A Room of One’s OwnFreedom of mind is something I take for granted. We all want to believe we’re untouched by all this propaganda but are we really? Yes, this is definitely a cautionary tale. I wonder how many are listening."
953,Alejandro,"1984 is a dystopian novel that is set in the future… except there is no future because Big Brother, a political party that rules a huge power in Oceania, controls time so there is no past and there is no future, there is no memory and there is no ambition. Winston Smith works for Big Brother under the ministry of truth where he is carefully watched by Big Brother via cameras, and he starts to write in his journal about what he doesn't like about life (which is forbidden by Big Brother). He does what he can to revolt against Big Brother, and all odds are against him. I really loved how the book was written in 1949 and we can still see some of the books messages still prevalent in today’s world. The book is so applicable to our lives in many ways which I don’t think has happened to me on this scale while reading this book. 1984 really is a great book."

955,Vidi,"Saya tidak pernah meragukan keberadaan Tuhan. Bahkan saya pun tidak pernah meragukan kebesaranNya. Hanya satu yang masih meragukan bagi saya yaitu campur tangan Tuhan dalam kehidupan manusia. Ada hukum-hukum yang diciptakanNya yang bahkan diriNya sendiri pun tidak dapat melanggarnya. Selamanya 2 + 2 = 4. Saya tidak yakin Tuhan dapat merubah itu. Bahkan bila seluruh manusia berdoa untuk itu. Bagaimana bila ada dunia imajiner di masa depan yang diperintah oleh pemerintah totalitarian yang kekuasaannya sedemikian absolut sehingga 2 + 2 bisa menjadi 5 bila Pemerintah menghendakinya. Pemerintah menguasai semua sendi-sendi kehidupan, segalanya, bahkan sampai kehidupan sex dan asmara warganya. Buku ini menggambarkan tentang itu.Buku ini bisa saja menjadi sebuah teori kekuasaan yang sangat masuk akal bila saja tidak terlalu banyak penyederhanaan. Bak Machiaveli, Orwell menceritakan cara-cara Partai melanggengkan kekuasaan yang lucunya mirip dengan cara-cara yang digunakan pemerintah totalitarian di mana pun termasuk OrBa di Indonesia. Yang paling mencolok adalah sebuah usaha yang sistematis untuk mengubah sejarah demi kepentingan penguasa dan pengkultusan individu. Lebih jauh lagi, Penguasa bahkan berusaha mengubah bahasa sebagai kerangka berpikir. Bila berhasil, ini akan memutuskan secara total dari masa lalu.Buku ini ditulis di tahun 1940-an tentang keadaan dunia di tahun 1984 di mana dunia dibagi menjadi tiga negara besar (salah satu penyederhanaan berlebihan yang saya sebut di atas) yang selalu saling berperang. Oceania, Eurasia, Eastasia. Novel ini disebut-sebut sebagai salah satu novel terbaik sepanjang masa. Pertanyaan yang terlintas adalah apa menariknya membaca sebuah fiksi tentang masa depan yang sekarang sudah terlampaui dua puluh tahun. Dengan sedikit imajinasi agar tidak terjebak dengan kerangka waktu, novel ini - paling tidak menurut saya - masih pantas menyandang gelar sebagai salah satu novel terbaik sepanjang masa. Yang paling menarik, buat saya, adalah cara Orwell menyajikan klimaks cerita. Janganlah mengharapkan sebuah perang revolusi yang berdarah-darah. Klimaks yang disajikan Orwell jauh lebih memikat dari itu, sebuah konflik psikologis yang intens. A must read.."
956,Jenna (Jinkies Books),"I'm going to be honest, this book took me MONTHS to get through. It kept getting put on the backburner for a while because of other class books and because some parts made me wanna fall asleep. In fact, it took me four months. Despite that I loved it. This book was the perfect mix between a novel and an essay. It made me think about so many different things, the government, media all the different parts of the world controlling who everyone turns out to be.This is a story about a man named Winston, and in this dystopian society any thought against the government can be deadly. And Big Brother is always watching. Winston begins to try to escape the telescreens that are all over the city, these can transmit and receive anything that happens, and falls in love with Julia. Winston decides he hates the government and wants to join the rebels- however things don't really go according to plan.This book makes a statement about the world, not just how it is today but how it is in the past. In this book the past is alterable, if the government says they were at war with Eastasia then they destroy all evidence saying they hadn't. There was so much philosophy in the final part (of three) and this entire book made my head hurt- in a good way. The ending was exactly how I expected it to be, but not how I actually wanted it to end. It was the perfect ending for Orwell's message. Maybe some day I'll read Animal Farm."
957,Martyna,"Roman 1984, je smješten u budućnosti (jer je knjiga izašla 1948.) u Londonu. Svijet je podjeljen na tri velike sile, Euroaziju, Istaziju i Oceaniju koje međusobno ratuju. Sve prati Veliki brat koji sve vidi i sve čuje, društvo je podjeljeno na partije. Užu i i Širu (viši i niži stalež) i prole-koji ne pripadaju nikakvoj strani. Cilj partije je potpuno osvojiti čovjeka i onemogućiti mu privatni život. Svaki dom se putem telekrana pozorno motri, svaka aktivnost, svaki pokret i čovjekov izraz lica, a na pokornost pazi Ministarstvo ljubavi. Ljude se drže u velikom siromaštvu i smanjuje im se i najosnovnije resurse.Djecu se uči da budu vjerni članovi partije i stave je čak ispred obitelji, da budu dobri špijuni. Djeca su nasilna, vole partiju, napadaju svakoga sumnjivog i vesele se svačijem smaknuću. U školi se uče laži, iskrivljuje se povijest, pljuje se u udžbenicima po kapitalistima, a građani se potiču na mržnju prema vanjskom neprijatelju tijekom Dvije minute mržnje.U središtu radnje je Winston Smith koji radi u Ministarstvu istine, gdje je preoblikovao podatke koji bi odgovarali sadašnjosti. Winston tek počinje pobunu kad se zaljubi u mladu aktivisticu i radi nje prekrši svako pravilo, tajni razgovori i spolni odnosi.Winston je jedan monoton lik koji je otpočetka mrzio mlade žene jer je znao da nije u mogućnosti dobiti niti jednu. Monoton čovjek je kao mali bio svinja prema majci i novorođenoj sestri, uzevši im iz ruke zadnji komad čokolade. To je bio zadnji put da ih je vidio. Lik prema kome malo tko osjeti simpatiju završio je onako kako u najgorim noćnim morama nije ni zamišljao i poput ljudi koje je nekoć prezirao. Kraj je bio onakav kakvog nijedan čitatelj ne bi i nije želio, što pokazuje da nema izlaza iz takve situacije.Knjiga pokazuje svijet koji smo mogli stvoriti, pokazuje ljudsku mizeriju, želju za moći i čežnju za slobodom. George Orvell je stvorio svijet iz kojeg nema izlaza i politiku koju je nemoguće uništiti, pokazao je kako mala skupina ljudi može kontrolirati masom."
958,Bryan,"Orwell was only wrong on one count, the tyrannical dystopia was not completed in 1984, but it was significantly ramped up... In the 26 years since Apple's infamous ""1984"" Mac launch, and, the subsequent breakthroughs in the PC world which would eventually place us all in front of a screen, we've lost more privacy, freedoms and rights than ever before. We've also replaced them with nothing more than a shiny & new technocracy that promises the entire world, yet delivers only 0's and 1's.Here I am, writing a review which may very well be seen by my children, and my children's children. The thought of every generation to come knowing what we read (Goodreads,DailyLit), what articles/publications we researched or subscribed to (Bloglines,Digg,Delicious), what websites we visited (Google,Yahoo!), what images we looked at (Flickr,DeviantArt), what music we listened to (Last.fm,Pandora,iTunes), what Movies and TV shows we watched (IMDB,NetFlix,YouTube), what products we purchased (CraigsList,eBay,Amazon) what friends we kept (Facebook, MySpace), what food we ate (About,AllRecipes), and how we felt all hours of the day (Twitter,FriendFeed) may cause just about anyone to realize the technocracy and its Big Brother which Orwell warned about is very real, and we are indeed living in its growth stages today.The question is, will it be as dystopic and seemingly hopeless as Orwell forewarned when it reaches its maturity?One thing is for sure, we had better thank Orwell now and plan our escape, because it seems everywhere we look the control grid is in lock down phase... which side of history will you be on?

959,Tee Jay,"One of the biggest books of the 20th Century--heck, they even named a year after it. I don't think totalitarian regimes totally dig it though."
960,Hamzah Taha,"Without any doubt the best book i've read so far. Some parts of it are so brilliant and evil that it hurts! I was somehow disappointed with the ending..although i'm not sure if it's me or the book. I barely find any ending of a book satisfactory.Yet it deserves 5 starts, and every god damn minute of your time, my fellow reader."
961,Ana Campanha,"It wasn't until the third and last part of this book that I realized this story is some kind of horror. It's really disturbing when you think there is no way out... and worse, when the crude reality of this book hits you in the face. All the dogmas explained in the plot, every crowd control scheme, each idea spread throughout this book is/could be valid in a real world. An unbelievably inteligent and terrifying story. "

964,Sara Sbaraglia,"E' meglio essere amati o essere temuti? Può esistere qualcosa per cui non esistono parole per esprimerla? La realtà è oggettiva o è tale solo nella nostra mente?Gioca con la filosofia Orwell, ma lo fa in modo così brillante da riuscire a trascinare il lettore senza alcuno sforzo. La trama in sé non ha nulla di eccezionale, ma tutto il resto ha un fascino irresistibile. Il mondo creato non è soltanto un angoscioso regno del controllo assoluto del governo sui suoi cittadini, ma è un tentativo di completa distruzione della volontà umana non solo utilizzando il terrore, ma modificando la realtà.Un libro da inquadrare senza dubbio nel contesto storico che lo fece nascere, l'esplosione dei regimi totalitari in Europa, con tutte le loro atrocità morali e materiali, ma anche un romanzo immortale, potente, angosciante, attuale.Consigliatissimo e, aggiungerei, obbligatorio. Sicuramente una delle cose migliori che mi sia capitato di leggere."

966,Alicia,"I enjoyed this book an awful lot, I was amazed to find it so gripping, especially as it was written in a different period from now. I loved Orwell's style of writing and the way he pulled you into the story, the way he described the setting and what was going on. I really felt for Winston. The book had a lot of alternation which made it the total opposite to a dull read, which before I picked the book up and started reading, I was imagining it to be. no this was a fast paced story and I loved it. I'd recommend it to everyone, because even my sister Rowan, who NEVER reads, read this book and loved it! I'm now looking forward to reading more of Orwell's classics. "
967,Remo Ronconi,"1984 is a dystopian novel that takes place in 1984, a year once thought to be very futuristic and technologically advanced. 1984 follows the story of Winston, a man who lives begins to question Big Brother and the way they run society. Big Brother acts as the government in 1984, they are very controlling and oppressive. When Winston begins to rebel against Big Brother he starts writing in a journal, which is not allowed under any circumstances. as the book progresses on Winston meets other people who understand him and share the belief that Big Brother is up to no good. (or so he thinks) I thought 1984 was a pretty good book, but its pretty old and it was slightly hard for me to understand what was going on at some points, other than that the book was fantastic. I would not recommend this book to young children, because it gets pretty graphic for a while One thing that I really liked about 1984 was how we the ideas of Big Brother and how they treated their people can be seen in many governments today, and that's a pretty scary thought."
968,Rawail Naeem,Frustratingly brilliant! 
969,mohamed mostafa,"1- 1984 raises the question of whether honor, duty, and responsibility are possible in ourown day for the individual who finds himself under the control of the modern totalitarian state.In 1984, the individual counts for nothing. Whatever feelings of conscience an individual has can be destroyed by brainwashing.The state can replace feelings of conscience with whatever it wants.2- Information is not lacking, however; the people of Oceania are constantly flooded with news.Winston Smith is one of the small cogs that helps make the system work.Winston Smith’s job at the Ministry of Truth is to fabricate history, because one slogan of the Party is that ""he who controls the present controls the past and he who controls the past controls the future"".Those in power can rewrite history and, thereby, control the perceptions of future generations.3- In Oceania, people are told that ignorance is strength, war is peace, and slavery is freedom. The people must be willing to accept these paradoxes. To survive in the Oceania of 1984, one must practice and be convinced of doublethink, the ability to hold in one’s mind two completely contradictory ideas and believe them both sincerely.4- During a hate session, someone has whispered to Winston, “We will meet again in a place where there is no darkness.” That person sounded like O’Brien.Winston reads to Julia a disturbing book that O’Brien has given him. It indicates that the Party is really about control, describes how to get and maintain power, and shows that warfare is a way of creating constant poverty. Winston learns that the entire social fabric is a lie.5- when Winston and Julia thought that they have deceived party and O'brein is on their side they were taken to the Ministry of Love and shocked by knowing O'Brien is really an agent of the Thought Police.O’Brien interrogates and tortures Winston until he believes that 2 + 2 = 5 if the Party says it does. Winston realized that Power is the ability to inflict pain and humiliation on another and nothing is more awful than physical pain. pain that makes him cries out, ""do it to Julia!"".6- Winston, the man of honor and courage, understands what the individual can do in the face of such overwhelming power—nothing.7- after Winston is released, he met Julia. Winston felt nonchalant about her. They spoke of their mutual betrayal and how torture can change people. They agreed to meet again, though neither intended to carry that out.8- Winston, the man who wrote ""DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER"", now is listening to the telescreen spewing propaganda that he now truly accepts and looking up at the picture of Big Brother on the telescreen, and feels joy over his love for him and the great victory he has won over himself (as a traitor)."

971,Evan Leach,"It is annoying when people tell you that you ""must read"" a book. I am well aware (and sympathetic) of that fact. But in my opinion, if there is one book that every American should read, it is this one. The absolute gold-standard of dystopian fiction, 1984 is an uncomfortably prophetic vision of a disturbing future. An enormously important book, and a riveting story to boot. Do yourself a favor and read this before the clock strikes 13. 6 stars, highest possible recommendation!"
972,Rowan Hisham,"This book was mind blowing I just finished reading it and i'm speechless, it was in Newspeak ""Double Plus Good.""Quotes that I loved:“The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.” “He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.”“If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.”“If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—for ever.”“Until they became conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.” “The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind, happiness is better.” “Being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.” “For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable – what then?”"

974,Omkar Shukla,"WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.Oh my god, probably the most haunting book I've ever read. 1984 should also be included in the horror genre.1984 describes a Utopia in a way that makes V for Vendetta look like sissy. All the lives are controlled by the state. A mere hint of disobedience or dislike can be detected by state. They use the apparatus such as the Thought Police, Telescreen, or even worse your children. The language(Newspeak) is also modified in such a way that you cannot express what you want to, since individualism is non-existent.The past is rewritten into something that will strengthen the current ruler, again and again, over and over. Who controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present, controls the past. There is no real truth. “Everything faded into mist. The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth.”Overall, a visionary novel in which George Orwell creates a disturbing picture of the future. A must must read!"

976,Allison,"	1984 is about Winston Smith who is living in a world with a system that he doesn’t believe in. The Party control everything by altering the past through records. The way they see it, they can control reality by having control over the past, and people’s mind. Winston wants to rebel. He meets a girl named Julia, who feels the same way. The have an affair secretly, and try to get into the underground system of rebellion. The only questions are, who they can trust, and how long it will be before they get caught.	This book was written really well. It had a really good writing style. The book was explained just enough to make you think without being completely lost. It’s great that the author, George Orwell does an afterword where he really reflects on the themes in the book. It makes it seem realistic, and makes you be able to see it in your world now. 	I personally thought this book was great. The themes made you think and really relate to your world. I would definitely rate it a 5. I would recommend this to anyone who likes conspiracies as well. "
977,AmberBug *shelfnotes.com*,"I am more then halfway through the book and I felt compelled to write what I thought of it thus far. The book reminds me of Anthem in many ways. It's almost like a pre-Anthem society that tells a very similar tale. Controlled society, man rebels, man meets girl, girl adores man and also rebels, etc. This story is a bit more involved though, especially regarding the Brotherhood and how there is not just one man against many, but an entire group rebelling (underground). Anthem's message skimmed the surface but so far 1984 has broken it down and analyzed it more, which I am really enjoying. This also makes me feel more connected to the story.One of the thoughts that came to my head was: To fight against control, one must be controlled. The brotherhood controls the ones fighting against the Ministry (Big Brother), therefor using control to gain freedom from control. Dying for freedom is a scary thought but a big theme in the book which has awakened me to an understanding of survival of self vs. survival of the human race. So far the story is extremely entertaining, thought provoking and slightly scary. After finishing the book, one word describes how I felt: Hopeless(ness). I cried a bit at the end but not from a loss of a character or from any tragic event but from a feeling of absolute hopelessness. My friend had said how he hated the ending, and I disagreed... I loved it because it created the strongest emotions from the message the author was trying to convey. If the ending had been victorious the feeling wouldn't have been as strong and the tone would have been completely wrong (in my opinion). "
978,Mai ,"""He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother""As a writer, or a person who is willing to be an official one, writing isn't easy. It drains all the intellectual power you contain, and its perfection is a must. To imagine the combination of the perfected elements within this novel somehow indicated 1)either George Orwell is an absolute genius or 2) he is not human. Both presumptions are equally possible. The language is perfect, the imagery, the Dystopian world,the plot, the metaphors, the events, all are perfect. After finishing Part 1, I couldn't help but notice that this novel might be considered the father of Dystopian novels, and that many famous novels today have been inspired one way or another by this book. Examples are Veronica Roth's series, and Lauren Oliver's trilogy. Both writers have took a sub-idea and developed it into a series. Veronica worked on division of the ministries, Laurel on the prohibition of love/lust/desire and also created a society on that basis. While reading this novel Orwell's biography hasn't escaped me. I sensed its impact on this novel, as well as on his others, since they are all merely political. Here are some of the most interesting information I discovered which have a link with the novel:-""Because of his background—he famously described his family as “lower-upper-middle class”—he never quite fit in, and felt oppressed and outraged by the dictatorial control that the schools he attended exercised over their students’ lives. ""-""He hated his duties in Burma, where he was required to enforce the strict laws of a political regime he despised.""-""Orwell bought ragged clothes from a second-hand store and went to live among the very poor in London.""-""He later lived among destitute coal miners in northern England, an experience that caused him to give up on capitalism in favor of democratic socialism.""-""he rise to power of dictators such as Adolf Hitler in Germany and Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union inspired Orwell’s mounting hatred of totalitarianism and political authority.""-According to one biography, Orwell's first word was ""beastly.""Why am I mentioning this? I believe in the school of Traditional Criticism, where there is usually some information on the writer and his times, and a little illustration, but no close analysis of the individual work or its aims. Somehow some of the facts above might have inspired him when he wrote this novel.Varied themes have been carried throughout the novel, all which are as important as the others, starting from him alluding to the dangers of totalitarianism, going through the psychological manipulation, the physical control, the control of information and history - the first by inventing a new vocabulary under the label of NEWSPEAK, and limiting it to a small amount of words to prevent the party members and the proles from thinking, the second by instantly deleting every record of any past dangerous events which might in any way threaten their power-, and ending with technology, smart smart technology shaped into telescreens and microphones.The most prominent symbols which will stick through your brain all the way long are Big Brother; a non-existent figure according to our current scientific terms -or as Winston put it a person who accomodates a space, which has a mass-, an existent according to Ociena and a figure which will never die. The Telescreens also symbolize how totalitarian government abuses technology for its own ends instead of exploiting its knowledge to improve civilization. The Red-Armed Prole Woman whom Winston hears singing through the window represents Winston’s one legitimate hope for the long-term future: the possibility that the proles will eventually come to recognize their plight and rebel against the Party. The Place Where There Is No Darkness instead of being the future paradise he had imagined, it was merely a prison cell. Hopefully, none of our future has met Orwell's expectations, but the novels depicts people in power and the sacrifices they can make to permanently control it. It is also depicts our capability of turning inhumane once we take hold of this omnipotent power.Fantastic! Note;'The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism, by Emmanuel Goldstein.' is a genius thing that needs to be extracted from the novel. Maybe if everyone reads this they will begin to understand the danger of blindfoldly believe their governments and become aware of the tricks which are played on their behalf. "

983,Emily Santiago,"Dystopian novels are absolutely fascinating. And, when a novel written as skillfully as 1984, with a captivating story line came along, I found myself enveloped in every nook and cranny of this book. The story follows our dear friend Winston, a member of the extremely oppressive Oceania. With an ultimately overruling government, ""the Party"", and its supreme ruler, ""Big Brother"", Oceania has abolished all relationships, love, family, and marriages. All devotion and loyalty must pertain o the Party, as there are even thought police and telescreens to survey their every move. Winston becomes aware of his hate for the Party, falls in love with Julia, and is caught by the though police. After undergoing extreme brainwashing, he then falls victim to the Party and Big Brother.I really enjoyed how detailed the book was. Personally, I appreciated knowing every knowing every detail of Winston's life, as I was able to better understand his world. I also found Winston uncomfortably admirable. With a complete drive to rebel and an ultimate surrender. Overall, this is one of the best stories I have read and would definitely recommend it. "

987,Brent Jensen,"I never read this in high school, and I probably wouldn't have appreciated it if I had. But it's a classic for a reason: brilliant, prophetic, and more than just a little bit frightening.Full of so many gems that speak to tactics used by governments, religions, and even corporations. This is one that struck me as I read it, ""War prisoners apart, the average citizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or Eastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate.""It made me realize how common a control tactic it is for groups to use fear and the concept of 'other' to not only exercise control over their followers but also promote blind, dogmatic obedience and unquestioning deference to and worship of the authority of the leaders of the group as the only protection from the fabricated enemy. Today we have free access to languages and information so this should not be an issue, however data overload makes it so that we look to 'trusted' sources to help us digest, often with the result of our using those sources much like a drunk uses a lamp post: not for illumination, but for support. A cautionary tale for us all."

It tells the story of the oppressed people everywhere, the story of dictatorships worldwide. The story of Oceania applies to every country in the third world countries. It tells the story of my country, Syria. The big brother is there, the thought police is there, the Newspeak, the principles of the party, even the party is there. I imagined every single detail in this book as it is happening in front of me.

992,Miss Christoff,"Haunted is the final word to describe my feelings after reading Orwell's classic, ""1984"" for the first time as a 28 year old. While the current status of government, politics, humanity, and the world deeply overwhelm me, I have learned that it has been this way for a long time, and sadly, will continue on like this for a long time. The slogan "" WAR IS PEACE- FREEDOM IS SLAVERY- IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH"" sadly continues to ring true today. We are pacified by frankenfoods, falsified news stories, and the fear mongering media. My hope is that future generations will read this book under different conditions, but that can only happen if people awaken and discover their ability to enact change. Although this did not work out for Winston and Julia, I hope the conclusion is not predicative of reality. This book confirmed what I already struggle with. I am excited to move on to ""Brave New World"", next. Huxley, here I come!"
993,Kate Davis,"My second time through this book, and it made a lot more of an impression on me (I don't think the idea of ""sex as political act"" is entirely understandable for a 13 year old). What strikes me in reading this in the 21st century is how often we refer to it - for reasons it wasn't intended for. When we talk about 1984, we use it as a warning of technological advancement, of Big Brother watching us through telescreens and in reference to the Patriot Act. Really, that is simply a small tool used to show the destructive of something far larger - the obsession with power, especially from a Socialist standpoint (when read after Animal Farm, the emphasis on anti-Socialism becomes more obvious). More interesting to me was the direct correlation between Smith's emotional and physical states. When he's living under the Party, he has a multitude of health problems, pains, and drinks often. It's only when he's with Julia and experiencing the positive human emotions that we were created for that he feels healthy. Perhaps the easiest way to identify a violator of thought crime is to look for physical health. After he is under the Party's influence and has been broken in spirit and filled with hate, he loses the remaining teeth he has, balds, becomes gray, and drinks more than ever. Losing those positive capabilities was more detrimental than not having them in the first place. Overall, an interesting and perceptive account of what it means to be human, and a glimpse of what life could look like without the positive emotions that make us so."
994,J-train,Quite possibly my favourite novel of all time.
995,Vaibhav Sharma,"Haunting, entertaining, gripping, didactic and most of all, somewhat relevant in our world. This book has significantly changed the way I look at power and control. There is a line in the book, ""the best books are those that tell you things you already know"". This is one of those books. You can't help but notice the similarities between the ultimate infallible leader, 'Big Brother' and North Korea's supreme leader or how the fictional state of Oceania is virtually cut off from the rest of the world like North Korea (Ignorance is Strength?) or how there is complete and comprehensive surveillance via telescreens just like the recent NSA scandal where it was alleged that everyone is being spied upon. The fictional States in the book are in tacit ""peace"" with each other due to possession of atomic bombs, much like the major powers in our world today. (War is Peace or Peace is War?) Orwell's attack on totalitarianism in 1984 follows his attack on Stalianism in the Animal Farm. But 1984 takes it to another level. Inarguably, one of the best books I have ever read."
996,Gabriela,"This scared and shocked me more than I could ever have imaginedAt first I thought the main character to be annoyingly inhibited and found his thinking restrictive like, 'it's happening right in front of you, don't think in circles, just name it REPRESSION!', but he is a product of the world he is forced to live in. In that light, he is an exceptionally open-minded and rebellious thinker.I think George Orwell did an amazing job, showing the dangers of a society that wants to control not only what is known (history), but also what its citizens think (personality) or feel (humanity) and will do so to an extend where the human mind is but a farce of itself accepting everything that is offered to it by an 'infallible' authority out of fear or confusion.'1984' is a book a lot more adults should read espercially in this time of virtual surveillance and to make them think about what kind of future we want for ourselves(I know just about everyone is forced to read it in school but that's different from reading it and really getting the message)."
997,Rubén Barraza,"¡Si había alguna esperanza, radicaba en los proles!"
998,Kent,"Although George Orwell wrote this book a long time ago when 1984 was still way into the future; it is scary just how relevant his fictional characters fit into a contemporary setting in the 21st century. Through and including the ongoing and seemingly endless wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya. It is an uncanny coincidence to just how close we are to the world Orwell writes about. "
999,Chrissy♥Dev ,I had to read this book for class and i didn't know what to expect. My teacher had the class analyze the book in depth and how it connects to our government and society today. This book is great for essay and getting to learn how people think. Its very twisted and makes you think this is how some people think of the world and how to rule over a mass of people. It shows that in society there will always be a few rich and strong people ruling over the mass amounts of people and through the deception and brainwashing the have control and power of a society as a whole. It's amazing and i think you should definitely read this book. 
1000,Stephen,Few books have had more of an impact on my life. 
1001,De Sean Te,"George Orwell wrote this book to show how Josef Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, was controlling society. It also relates back when the United States, in 2002, when Edward Snowden ""whistle blowed,"" project PRISM, which NSA and CIA used to dig in metadata along with terrorist preventions. This book also shows a world where privacy is all lost. The story is mainly about the main character opposing to society's notion of privacy. Should the protagonist actually take this risk of opposing society? Please read to find out."

1006,Abdulrahman Aldeek," بينما كان عالم ما بعد الحرب العالمية الثانية أخدا في التشكل و استقطاب الدول بين المعسكرين الشيوعي و الرأسمالي على أشده،جاءت رواية جورج أورويل ""1984"" لتضع تصورا لما يمكن أن يكون عليه النظام الشمولي في أقصى حالاته و كأنها رسالة تحذير أطلقها أورويل ضد كل المستبدين و لا يزال صدى هذه الرسالة مسموعا في أرجاء العالم بعد اكثر من 60 سنة على كتابة هذه الرواية. و اعتقال طالب جامعي مصري قبل يومين لحيازته هذه الرواية و منعها في تايلند لدليل على أهمية الكتاب و حيوية محتواه و قدرته على ازعاج الانظمة الاستبدادية أينما كانت.في هذه الرواية يُعرف أورويل معنى الاستبداد في أقصى حالاته الذي يقوم على الغاء ""حالة الانسان"" كمخلوق فردي متميز في الاساس عن أقرانه و لديه القدرة على الاندماج في المجتمع ليصبح الناس كأنهم نسخ متشابهة خرجت من نفس الالة الطابعة بعد أن أُفرغت شخصياتهم تماما ليتم تشكيلها من جديد بأفكار عظمة الحزب و الاخ الاكبر الى اخره من الافكار المسمومة....فالانسان دون فكر و تجربة خاصة به يكون كالوعاء الفارغ الذي يقبل بأي أفكار من شأنها تعبئة هذا الفراغ. كما أنه يبرز فكرة التلاعب في الماضي التي لها أصول في التاريخ خصوصا في الاتحاد السوفيتي و ألمانيا النازية بشكل مخيف فبدون ماضي يفقد الانسان أي حس للمقارنة بين وضعه الحالي و ما كان عليه العالم في السابق و تضيع تضحيات الكثيرين هباء منثورا دون أن يتذكرها أحد و هذا يوضح بقوة معنى شعار الحزب ""من يتحكم في الماضي يتحكم في المستقبل. من يتحكم في الحاضر يتحكم في الماضي"".و تبقى فكرة ""أزدواجية التفكير"" التي تقوم على أن الانسان يجب أنه يفكر بشكل متضاد تماما و فهو يؤمن بالشيء رغم معرفته أن ايمانه خاطىء و هذا يدل على مدى سيطرة الدول الشمولية على عقول الناس لدرجة أنه لأجل الحزب يمكن أن تكون 2+2 تساوي اربعة و خمسة و ستة حسب الموقف. قام أورويل باقتدار بتصوير أقصى ما يمكن لإنسان أن يتخيله في نظام ظالم لا يرضى أن يطيعه الناس و يكرهوه من الداخل و إنما يقوم على تحطيم كل من تسول له نفسه المعارضة فكريا و هذه قمة الانتصار على أي إنسان مما يحدو هذا المعارض في نهاية المطاف أن يتقبل ""الاخ الاكبر"" كمخلص له و عن قناعة و أن يُطالب الحزب بإعدامه جزاء لما أقرف عقله من مخالفة للأخ الاكبر...لكم هذه مؤلمة أن يُنتصر على أفكارك التي هي رأس مال كل مثقف و صاحب رأي في الحياة و هذا أنكى من أي عذاب جسدي يمكن أن يلحق بإنسان.أعجبتني قدرة أورويل الرائعة على التحليل السياسي و التاريخي في قالب أدبي بليغ خصوصا في تحليله لأدبيات الحزب و أفكاره و تأثرت بمقدار الظلم الذي يمكن أن يوقعه الانسان بالانسان باسم السلطة المطلقة كما أني أحسست بعمق بأن الانسان بدون خصوصية و بدون قدرة حرة على التعبير عن أراءه و عواطفه ليس بأنسان و أنما الة لا أكثر ولا أقل.ستبقى هذه الرواية ببساطة محفورة في وجدان التاريخ الادبي العالمي لانها ستبقى صالحة لوصف الاستبداد و فضحه في أي مناسبة و على مر الزمن"

1010,Rich Quintyn,"Superb. Blew my mind and really provided an eye-opening take on the future.Orwell is able to craft a menacing dystopia that focuses attention on some of the growing problems of the present. The characters are developed only as necessary, but still able to portray feelings and emotions in a very stripped-down sense. The third part of book is a special achievement pulls me back to digest over and over again."
1011,Emma Kampschroeder," 2+2=5. No matter what you think - no matter what you know - when the government tells you that 2+2=5, they are correct. Disagree, and you will disappear. You will become an unperson. George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984 takes place in a totalitarian society where the government has control over every aspect of citizens’ private and public lives. It is the year 1984, and every move that is made, every facial expression shown, and everything that is done is monitored by telescreens. And, as always, “Big Brother is watching you"". The story follows Winston Smith, a man who can remember a time when the omnipotent Big Brother did not have control over everything. He slowly begins to rebel against the Party by committing thoughtcrime such as writing in a diary, avoiding telescreens, meeting up with his sweetheart, Julia, and eventually working secretly under Inner Party member, O’Brien.  Winston works at the Ministry of Truth, where documents are edited to make the Party look as good as possible and adhere to what they tell the public. Such as in the case of the province of Oceania, which is always at war with either Eurasia or Eastasia. Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia. But, it has always been at war with Eastasia. When the Party changes one thing, the entire history must be changed. And Winston is the one to edit it.  Winston is an Outer Party member unlike many of the others and is incapable of doublethink, which means “the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one’s mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them”. Other Oceania citizens are capable of doublethink, and this is why they accept that one day they have always been fighting Eurasia and the next day they have always been fighting Eastasia. His refusal to be manipulated by the government and the way he views society makes Winston a trustworthy and favorite character of mine. It is interesting to see how Winston views other characters, such as Julia. At first he fears “that the girl was an agent of the Thought Police” who had come to take him away for writing in his diary. However, Julia is actually a rebellious young woman who soon falls in love with Winston. Julia is a bit of an irksome character as she pays no attention to politics, and often when Winston is explaining something to her, she falls asleep. The two know their love can not last long as Big Brother is always watching, but they try to stay together and meet in secret as long as they can. O’Brien is a member of the Inner Party who holds a position high above Winston. Early on, Winston thinks that O’Brien might hold the same hatred for Big Brother as he does, which is proven true when he invites Winston to work secretly against the Party and Big Brother. However, the way Winston views O’Brien will change when they “shall meet in the place where there is no darkness"". I have always found O’Brien to be untrustworthy since he is a traitor to the Party, even though he claims he wants to return Oceania to what it once was. Although 1984 is told in third person, it is told from Winston’s point of view. While still referring to the character as “he”, Orwell grants us access into Winston’s thoughts and opinions by using third person limited point of view. Orwell tells the story in a sort of detached way, as though simply stating facts and not romanticizing anything, such as when Orwell writes, “As he put his hand on the doorknob Winston saw that he had left the diary open on the table”. What is happening is still being described, but not poetically as many authors do. Orwell’s style adds to the story because it is dystopian and bleak, so the disassociation compliments the genre and tone of the book.	Orwell also expands his version of a dystopian by introducing the language of Newspeak. “Newspeak was the official language of Oceania and had been devised to meet the ideological needs of Ingsoc, or English Socialism”. Newspeak eliminated unnecessary words that existed in Oldspeak (our current day English) such as replacing “bad"" with ungood and “excellent"" and “splendid” with plusgood, along with introducing new words such as thoughtcrime and doublethink. However, Newspeak was only enforced by the government and regular citizens did not commonly use it while speaking. Orwell’s word choice enhances the idea of a totalitarian society and makes this book more interesting.	Even though the story takes place in 1984, it still has many similarities to the dystopian books we read about that happen hundreds of years in the future. We live with the constant fear that our world will turn into this type of society, and most importantly, Orwell is warning us to avoid a totalitarian government at all costs. The events of this book are a real possibility of something that could happen in the near future if we allow the government to accumulate the power to control our whole lives and convince us that 2+2=5.	I would recommend 1984 to those who are intrigued by dystopian societies, but with more mature tastes than that of Divergent or The Hunger Games. 1984 contains the same type of rebellion against the government except with a more realistic society that focuses around adults instead of teenagers. Orwell tells the story bleakly and as it is, rather than romanticizing it for younger people. Despite my interest in young adult books, I found 1984 to be very well written and intriguing, and it really made me consider what it would be like to live in a totalitarian society."
1012,Reza Mardani,درباره خود کتاب و اتفاقاتی که توش میافته و کاری که با آدم میکنه هیچی نمیشه گفت. فقط باید خوندش. ولی پایان کتاب محشره، نه همه چی به خوبی و خوشی تموم میشه نه یه قهرمان متولد میشه. همه چی به نفع قدرت تموم میشه! همونطوری که در واقعیت می بینیم
1013,Louis,"Whilst the characters are uninteresting, and barely fleshed out this book is probably one of the best books I've read, if you could call it a book rather than an essay. At the beginning you feel as though you're reading about a remote existence, a hyperbole that would never happen, a society that would never function. But as the book goes on you begin to feel as though this is something possible, something that our own society, even if just a little bit, could touch upon one day. It highlights the beauty of humanity, with all our flaws and instincts intact, but also the beauty of our powerful intellect. At many points I feel as though George Orwell is pulling us between our ruthless energy to strive for better, bigger, faster and more POWER, and the instincts that make us human and have barely changed for thousands of years. I loved it, and would recommend it to anyone, not as a story but as a message, a peek into a society that could have been, or could be, and a voyage into the heart and mind of a man who feared the voracious, untamable increases in technology in the modern era."
1014,ShamanaeusX,"George Orwell's frightening classic of a despotic government gone mad is one of my favorite novels of all time. Every person - man, woman, or child - can relate to the protagonist, Winston Smith, who finds himself through the course of the book, an enemy of the State (known as IngSoc, or English Socialism, in the novel). Winston is one of the few people in the story who finally 'awakens' to the tyranny around him. It almost seems like the majority of the characters in this novel are like zombies...just going through the daily routines so they can finally get home and watch some football and drink some beer (the proles).This book, in my opinion, is a seer's prediction of the near future. It's a prediction of what's to come if the human race doesn't steer itself away from the current path of destruction that we're readily racing towards. It wouldn't surprise me at all if every government on the planet had a copy of this book, and were using it as a blueprint to carry out their evil deeds. If you want an intriguing story, full of political intrigue, romance, hardship, and philosophy, you need to read George Orwell's 1984...and soon, before you can no longer do so."

1022,Alexandra Jones,"I don't think there'll ever be a time I see this book on my shelf and think, I don't want to read that right now. I just keep picking it up. I'm a sucker for incredibly bleak dystopias, and for the everyman/everywoman who's life we are viewing. Winston is just like you or I - struggling to do his best in a world that is certainly not always on his terms. In fact, everyone is sort of normal and unremarkable... Just as most folk in any fascist dictatorship/oligarchy/monotheocracy etc are normal and unremarkable.As such, none of them, with perhaps the exception of O'Brien, are particularly note-worthy in and of themselves. They're boosted into interest through their situation. But that's okay. Like I say, I like an everyman!O'Brien, however, is terrifying. Terrifying in his very geniality. His absolute grasp of power and dogma and control is frightening because you cannot reason or bribe or convince a man like that. You are utterly at his disposal. There is no reprieve. There is nothing you can offer him that will turn him away.This book is a grim look into a possible future, and certainly not the only one or maybe even not the best in it's genre, but to me it lingers the longest in the memory. You are immersed in this greasy feeling throughout; the discomfort of every citizen, the grime, the cheapness, the rot, the smells, the poor quality of everything. You almost watch it in your head in muted tones. Its very visceral and conjures true feelings of down-and-out drear and constant dread.The part at the end where Winston admits that in the face of pain there are no heroes always gets me. It's incredibly true. We like to think of ourselves as noble, that we would do the right thing, hold onto ourselves and our secrets and protect those we love... but when it comes down to real physical pain we are all just cowering animals. All of us. I think this absolute truth is what keeps me coming back to it."
1023,Nano Villa,"Hace mucho que no leia una novela que me dejara pensando y me da gusto haberme decidido por esta, es una novela que si bien fue escrita en 1948 se puede muy bien sentir situada en epoca actual, no hablare en si del argumento de la historia mas bien me gustaria que tu como lector la descubrieras y formaras tu propia opinion, en lo personal no soy una persona muy empatica con todos los problemas politico/sociales mi entorno, pero esta novela me ha evocado muchos pensamientos precisamente sobre esto, mas sin embargo si he de decir que 1984 no es una novela que pretenda entretener, mas bien plantear ideas para que el lector las desarrolle segun su propio criterio, muy recomendable! "
1024,Brad Hodges,"I first read 1984 back in junior high school, and was incredibly grabbed by its dystopian view of society. This summer, it shot up the charts due to the NSA scandals, which suggests that the government may be more of a Big Brother than we even thought. I figured it was a good time to have another look at it.George Orwell wrote this book in 1949, and didn't intend it so much as a work of science fiction but a contemporary commentary. It has become an iconic book that not only gave us the terms Big Brother and the thought police, but a warning to any government that spreads its totalitarian wings.The book is set in England during the title year, but England is part of a larger nation, called Oceania. There are only three nations on Earth--Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia. One is always at war with another. Oceania's government has complete control over its citizens, particularly those in the party. There apartments have telescreens that work both ways, transmitting and spying on inhabitants. Children are taught to inform on their parents (the youth organization is called ""Spies""). Sex, while necessary to procreate, is encouraged only for that purpose, and there is an ""Anti-Sex League."" Citizens are encouraged to hate the enemy and the figurehead of the resistant movement, Emmanuel Goldstein, by periodic rages of hatred.Winston Smith, an average man who works in the Ministry of Truth, is troubled by it all. He rebels by finding a nook in his apartment that is unseen by the telescreen and starting a diary. For one thing, he has memories and knows things he is told is untrue: ""The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated.""Winston's job is to recreate history. Anytime a person becomes an unperson, or the war changes, or an official contradicts himself, he goes in and changes the record, which in Orwell's world only meant print. It's amusing and disturbing to think that now this is much easier to accomplish, as digitally changing something is a snap.Later Winston will meet a woman, Julia, who shares his views. She hands him a note that says simply, ""I love you,"" the three words that are most effective at changing anyone's outlook on life. They share an idyllic period of love and sex in the proletariat part of town, where people live in poverty but are not of interest to the party. But of course they are eventually found out. Then the book shows the full extent of the power of the government.The book is easily readable, even with a large section devoted to the book written by Goldstein, which lays out the problems of society--there are three classes: the upper, middle, and lower, and that the first is trying to maintain its status, while the second tries to join the first, and the third is hopelessly locked in the basement. Winston believes that only the ""proles"" can provide the revolution needed to overthrow Big Brother. But Orwell will not let him, or us, have our fantasy.This book is incredibly rich. Early on we hear a character called Syme discourse on ""newspeak,"" an eradication of English into a simplistic form: ""'It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well...Take 'good,' for instance. If you have a word like 'good,' what need is there for a word like 'bad?' 'Ungood' will do just as well...what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like 'excellent' and 'splendid' and all the rest of them? 'Plusgood' covers the meaning; or 'doubleplusgood' if you want something stronger still.""Also, the notion of saying exactly what is opposite, which is a large part of most governmental language, comes into play here. The slogan everyone is forced to read on a constant basis is ""War is Peace/Freedom Is Slavery/Ignorance Is Strength."" Winston works at the Ministry of Truth, which is concerned with lies. The Ministry of Peace is the war department. The Ministry of Plenty keeps the people in starvation mode. And then there's the Ministry of Love.The final act of the book is the torture Winston goes through after being caught. It is harrowing and eye-opening. His torturer reasons with him calmly, even while giving him incredible jolts of pain. He is beaten down over months, and when he believes he has at least kept something--he has not yet betrayed Julia--they take that away from him, in a scene right out of Poe (it involves rats). I remembered the words for almost forty years, and here they were, exactly as I remembered them: ""Do it to Julia!""Some other aspects of the book have become true: ""It was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts and lucky amulets.""1984 is not a happy read, but it does have its moments of weeds breaking through the concrete. Orwell's position is that the party will never be overthrown, as they are too consumed with power to ever let it happen. But just by Winston thinking the thoughts he does is rays of sunshine. ""Being in a minority, even a minority of one, did not make you made. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the world, you were not mad.""That's important to remember, especially when even in the freest of societies one realizes that the reality of 1984 is disturbingly too close for comfort."

1028,Jill Zhang,"In the book 1984 written by George Orwell, the Party of the Oceania had control over the media. There is no private media companies. Actually, nothing is private. The party owns everything, which means that the Party can revise and even fabricate the history and news arbitrarily. Winston Smith, who is the protagonist of the book, works at the Ministry of Truth, which hold the control over the news and entertainment. In the Ministry of Truth, Winston Smith gradually found out that actually the history and news they learned and heard were all fake. Nobody knows what happened in the front line and how much products the country produced exactly. All the things are nearly fabricated in the world of 1984. One will never know whatever he or she heard is a lie or not. Things and news are constantly being revised or totally changed to establish the fact that the party is always correct, and the Big Brother is never wrong. The name Ministry of Truth actually self-contradicts itself. It is a place full of lies."
1029,Kong,"Let me just say, this is among my top novels of this year. 1984 always has you on the edge of your seat, and I personally have never been so frustrated at a book.Winston is just an innocent man with, brace yourselves, a functioning brain! Yet, the Party has brainwashed everyone, even children, to be the complete opposite. Eventually, poor Winston and his secret woman are found, and he is brought to the Ministry of ""Love"" which is ironic, because this is actually torture. Room 113 is filled with whatever you fear most. The Party's main intention is to force their victims to believe in the Party before they die, and several times, Winston overcomes the Party's influence. But I became so frustrated in the end, when Winston gives in and loves Big Brother! This is a highly action filled read, with little to no extraneous detail, which makes it wonderful. Highly recommend!"

1031,Zohra Ouahabi,"رواية 1984 لجورج أورويل :استغرق أورويل كتابة هذه الرواية ثلاث سنوات بداية من 1945, ونشرت في عام 1949. و قد ترجمت هذه الرواية لـ 62 لغة والتي منعت في الكثير من الدول والكثير من المكتبات حين صدورها باعتبارها رواية خطرة سياسياً. جدير بالذكر أن مجلة “التايم” اختارت هذه الرواية كواحدة من أفضل 100 رواية كتبت بالإنجليزية من عام 1923 وحتى عام 2005.عبقرية أورويل كمفكر سياسي في هذه الرواية تجعلك تفهم بشكل واضح الأيدلوجية التي تتبناها الأنظمة الشمولية والتي تهدف أساسا إلى محو الذات الإنسانية وتحويلها إلى مجرد آلة تخدم مصالحها أولاً وأخيراً . إن الكاتب في روايته تنبأ بما سيحدث بعد أربعين سنة -بعد إنتهاء الحرب العالمية الثانية- و بعد تولي هذه الأنظمة سدة الحكم واستمرارها فيما هي عليه من بث كل أنواع الإستبداد في العالم.قسم أورويل في روايته العالم إلى ثلاث دول عظمى : الدولة الأولى هي “أوقيانيا”, وهي عبارة عن الأمريكيتين واستراليا والجزر البريطانية. والدولة الثانية هي “أوراسيا”, وأراضيها هي روسيا والباقي من أوروبا. والدولة الثالثة هي “إيستاسيا” وتتكون من الصين واليابان وكوريا وشمال الهند. أما بالنسبة للشرق الأوسط, وجنوب الهند, وأفريقيا, فهي عبارة عن ساحات حرب ومناطق متنازع عليها من قبل هذه الدول الثلاث. ولحسن حظ هذه الدول ، أنها لم تسير في ذلك المنحى الذي تصوره الكاتب، بينما واقع هذا التطرف الأستبدادي يظهر جلياً في الدول محل النزاع، مثال الدول العربية التي منها من تخلصت من تلك الأنظمة ومنها من هي في طور الإنسلاخ وأخرى مازالت تتلوى تحت وطأته .تلك الانظمة الشمولية المستبدة التي شعارها الوحيد هو الولاء للحاكم الواحد والذي سماه أورويل ""الأخ الكبير "" وللحزب الواحد،تسعى إلى ترسيخ لغة جديدة و تجريم الفكر وإلغاء التاريخ والماضي ، بل تطوعه حسب ما يحلو لها وحسب ما يمشي مع واقعها هي، بتزوير الحقائق ومحو الحجج والدلائل ،و إنشاء لغة جديدة ضيقة المفردات والمعاني ، حتى يضيق الفكر والتفكير -ويعم الجهل والغباء البشري وتعم التبعية المطلقة بلا وعي لما هو حاصل .ففي اللغة الجديدة ، قد تضم الكلمة معنيين متضادين ، تستعمل الكلمة حسب الموقف والمراد منها في ذلك الموقف وبل يجب التصديق بما تعنيه في ذلك الموقف ، رغم أنه يتنافى مع ما تعنيه حقيقة ، ونسيان تلك الحقيقة ونسيان أنك نسيت تلك الحقيقة ,حتى يجعلوك تصدق أن إثنان زائد إثنان هي خمسة أو ثلاثة و ليس أربعة، حسب ما يريدون, هو ما يسمى بأزدواجية التفكير. فالحرب هو السلام والحرية هي العبودية والجهل هو القوة .الماضي والحاضر والمستقبل ، كلها أرصدة تتكون من خلالها شخصية وفكرو ثقافة الأنسان ، الماضي هو التاريخ وهو الذاكرة، والذكريات ، الحاضر هو ما يعشه الأنسان والشعور بأنك حي والمستقبل هو الحلم الذي يعيش عليه ، من خلال محو كل هذه التواريخ وتبديلها وتزييفها بحيث لا تعرف من أي ماضي أنت وماذا تعيش الان ولماذا تعيش ، تدور تكتيكات الأنظمة الشموليية ، فتمنعك بذلك من الشعور بذاتك وانسانيتك وتتحكم في علاقتك وتصرفاتك وما يجب عليك ، تراقبك بدون كلل وملل هي معك أينما حللت في الماضي وفي الحاضر وفي المستقبل,بوسائل مختلفة ، شاشة الرصد ، شرطة الفكر ، الجواسيس والأطفال المجندة لذلك . .نهاية الرواية كانت محبطة لأن أورويل كتبها في فترة مليئة بالنزاعات والحروب، فكانت السوداوية طابعاً للرواية في كل أجزاءها وفصولها ، تخوفه مما سينتج عنها جعلها بذلك الشكل وحتى في العالم العربي و الذي يعاني إلى أبعد حد من هذه الأنظمة ، استطاع أن يرسم مسارا أخر في دول الربيع العربي غير الذي رأه في الرواية بأن إستسلم أخر رجل في أوروبا إلى حب الأخ الكبير وإلى الحزب بعدما بدأ يثور بفكره من جراء ما تعرض له من غسيل دماغ ممنهج.لقد أضاءت الثورات العربية أملا كان قد إنطفأ ، ذلك الأمل الذي ركز عليه أورويل كثيراً وهو العامة فهم """"لن يثوروا حتى يعوا و لن يعوا حتى يثوروا"" ، لقد وعت العامة أنا ذاتها الإنسانية تمحق وبالتالي فوجودها ملغي ولا دور لها فثارت ، ما يبقى هو الوعي بعد الثورة الذي هو مكمل للوعي الأول والذي به فقط سيحافظون على ثورتهم و ذاتهم المحررة .يجب أن تقرأ هذ الرواية وبشدة "
1032,Aljoharah Alobaikan,"رواية أكثرمن سوداوية , ولكن اذا عرفنا الفترة التي كتبت خلالها , والتي هي ظاهرة من العنوان الذي هو انعكاس للعام الذي كتب خلاله الكتاب , أي العام 1948 , أي أن الكتاب قد تم تأليفه فقط بعد ثلاث سنوات على الحرب العالمية الثانية , الحرب التي لم تبق ولم تذر , الحرب التي اطاحت بأحلام الإنسانية في العيش الهانئوفي اعتقادي أنه في ظل هذه الظروف الموجعة جاء كتاب اورويل كنتاج طبيعي للوضع انذاك.كتاب 1984 ليس عملا روائيا عاديا فالكتاب في نظري هو دعوة صريحة للمقاومة , للثورة , وللدفاع عن الحقوق التي انتزعت. في اسشرافه للمستقبل يصور لنا اورويل المجتمع الذي سنعيش فيه بعد سنوات المجتمع الذي نصبح فيه كلنا عبيدا بطريقة او باخرى , المجتمع الذي يوحدنا تحت راية الخوف الازلي , الخوف من زوجتك وابنك واخيك ورفيقك , الخوف من ان تفضحك فكرة عابرة تمر براسك , الخوف من أن ترمش عينك أو يدق قلبك لانه كان عليك بحكم العادة التي تحولت الى غريزة ان تفترض ان كل صوت يصدر عنك مسموع وان كل حركة مرصودة.النظام الحزبي في الرواية كان يسعى وقد نجح والذي نجح في الوصول اليه كان في احدى مراحل غسله للأدمغة يعمل على خلق شرطي داخل كل رأس لا بل انه قام بخلق جهاز مخابرات قمعي داخل كل رأس من رؤوس اشباه البشر الذين كانوا متواجدين فقد قاموا باجراءات لم تخطر من قبل على بال بشر سوى (اورويل) هدفها الوصول بالبشر الى النسيان التام , والفقدان الكامل للهوية الانسانية , وهذا الامر ليس خطيرا فقط , بل مرعب جدا , وقد تم لهم ذلك اخيرا . تم ذلك عن طريق وسائل من بينها انهم قاموا بالغاء الفروقات كل الفروقات بين البشرفصاروا متشابهين في كل شيء , ولهذا كان للحزب زي رسمي مثلا , للامعان في فصل اعضاء الحزب عن بقية الشعب , وكذلك لانهم ارادوا لاعضاء الحزب ان يكونوا متشابهين في كل شيء واذا اخذنا التشابه في المظهر الخارجي مع ما تتم زراعته يوميا من اكاذيب واوهام في العقول, مع ما يتم نزعه من النفس البشرية من مشاعر سنرى ان ما يخلقه الحزب هو مجموعة من العبيد , الذين ستكون مهمتهم في هذا العالم هي الطاعة العمياء اللانهائية لاوامر الحزب , وعدم الجرأة ولا القدرة على عصيان اوامر الاخ الاكبر في هذه الرواية يثبت جورج أورويل أنه ليس أديباً فذاً فقط, بل يثبت أنه مفكر سياسي حاذق, فهو لم يكتفي بتحليل الفكر الاستبدادي وتحليل طريقة عمله, بل تجاوز ذلك ليتنبأ لنا بنبؤة مستقبلية متكاملة مذهلة لما سوف يؤول إليه هذا الفكر إن استمر حاله على ما هو عليهمما لاشك فيه أن جورج أورويل استوحى الكثير من سمات “الأخ الأكبر” من القائد الثاني للاتحاد السوفيتي “جوزيف ستالين”, واستوحي الكثير من سمات مجتمع “أوشيانيا” من مجتمع “الاتحاد السوفيتي” حينذاك, حتى شخصية المنشق “إيمانويل غولدشتاين” مستوحاة من الثوري الماركسي “ليون تروتسكي” الذي طرد من الحزب الشيوعي وأبعد عن الاتحاد السوفيتي هذه الرواية هي الأولى من نوعها في تاريخ قراءاتي، أفادتني كثيرًا، وتركت لدي تصورًا ربما يكون صائبًا وربما يكون خاطئًا عن المستقبل.والله نسأل أن يصلح أحوال مجتمعاتنا.. وأن يجعل مستقبلها خيرًا من ماضيها وحاضرها فمجتمع لا مكان فيه للحب , هو مكان لا يصلح للعيش"

1034,Allen,"I hear that more and more people are talking about this book, probably due to the NSA scandal and suspicion or dislike of President Obama. Whatever the case, I decided to read this book because a couple of the news sources I use cite specific concepts from the book and apply them to current events. The two most repeated concepts I hear are: 1) Two Minutes Hate and 2) Ministry of Truth. In current events, these two concepts are applied, respectively, 1) to the treatment of those who do not conform to the worldview and opinions prescribed by mainstream culture or mainstream media and 2) to the mainstream media and political spokespersons.In the book, the Two Minutes Hate is by far the most disturbing event to me upon first reading it, and it happens early in the book. You are getting to know Winston, the main character, and all of a sudden, you are led into a room with him and are swept up in the frenzy. Later events in the book seem heinous to me, but I am not surprised by them (i.e. the social apparatus of coercion and compulsion (""Ministry of Love"") using force in unethical ways) as I was with the Two Minutes Hate.In addition to producing works of art and culture, the Ministry of Truth is primarily responsible for writing history. Previously recorded statements or forecasts that contradict a later statement made by a Party member or contradict outcomes are destroyed and rewritten to fit the new agenda or confirm the realistic outcome.These two concepts are just part of the totalitarian governance in Winston Smith's Oceania.The story is a tragedy and the main character is aware of the inevitability of being captured for his Thought Crime. The tragedy is not in his capture and torture, but in his betrayal of his lover and his principles. In the end, he loves Big Brother and is killed by Him for it."
1035,Monica Gabellini,"Un libro assolutamente da leggere.E' inquietante come Orwell abbia predetto il futuro, considerato l'anno in cui ha scritto questo romanzo. Ogni volta che affronta una questione come il fatto di essere spiati giorno e notte dalle nuove tecnologie, l'evoluzione della lingua o la sete di potere di chi sta al comando viene da pensare: ""come diavolo faceva a saperlo?"" Anche l'atmosfera triste che aleggia per tutta la durata del libro richiama l'apatia che contagia sempre di più le persone di questo millennio.Nonostante io sia totalmente a favore dei discorsi diretti che rendono tutto più veloce, qui i dialoghi sono pochi ma la storia è talmente interessante da prendere vita da sola. Interessante notare anche la quantità di libri e film che hanno preso spunto da 1984. "
1036,Cielo Castro,"1948: Cielo CastroIntro:	Throughout this time the book that I have been reading was 1984 by George Orwell. The book is a Dystopian fiction book. In my opinion I state that I did not like this book, because it had some confusing words like Polysyllabic, Labyrinthine, and Pneumatic. Those words bring to my mind the word ""WHAT."" Otherwise this book brings questions to my mind, because it’s a hard book to understand. The way it expresses it's self or is written makes it hard for someone to picture it in mind. Since that is what most people do when they are reading a book picture the setting of it. In how this book relates to with todays society and back then is that they would try and make people get mad at you and or make things up about you. Which now days they don't because they know who you are very well. Body: 	In the novel of 1984 the main character was Winston Smith, and there setting was Victory Mansion with large glass doors. Had a painting of a face of the hallway on the wall. Although one of the things that I really liked was this one quote they used which was ""Only because I prefer a positive to a negative. In this game that we're playing, we can't win. Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds, that's all."" The reason why I like that quote is because that's all I do in life prefer the positive comments than the negative. Especially when it involves a game type of thing. I would rather hear positive comments that we will win then the negative. Meanwhile, almost to the end the book gets good because it involves Winston Smith. Better for you to read then me telling a summery about it. In fact, the author George Orwell did not just write the book of 1984, but also the book that seems pretty interesting named ""The Road to Wigan Pier"" which was a novel written in those days that he was struggling in life. The biography of George Orwell was that he was an English novelist, journalist, and a critic. There is one of his quotes that also makes me think of what it is referring to the quote is ""Big Brother is watching you."" In my opinion what I think this quote is trying to say is that God is watching after us, and that he knows all that we do. 	Eventually, I consider y'all to not read the book 1984, because it will not make any sense to you. Going back to what the book genre is, it is a Dystopian Fiction book. The name of it is 1984, and it was written by George Orwell. Although I challenge you to read this book so that you can know if it is a good book or not. Trying to prove me wrong. Once you read the book ask yourself if it was a good book, and if not say to yourself she was write it wasn't a good book. Enjoy reading! "
1037,Usama,لما شفت مقطع الفيديو 2+2=5 لم أكن أعرف أنه مأخوذ من رواية 1984 لجورج أوريل والذي لم أكن قد سمعت به ولا بروايته من قبل ولكن وبمجردمعرفتي بأن هذا المقطع مستوحى من هذه الرواية قررت قراءتها وبالفعل بدأت قراءتها وباعتبار أن الرواية كتبت أواخر عقد الأربيعينيات من القرن العشرينجعلتني أفكر بعقل من عاشوا في تلك الفترة فوجدت الرواية بأنها خيالية جداً ولربما صنفتها ضمن صنوف الكوميديا السياسية ولكن سرعان ما عدت لحقيقةأني أعيش في القرن 21 وبالتحديد في عام 2014 بعد 30 سنة من السنة الافتراضية للرواية وقت كتابتها لأجد بأن هذه الرواية في كثير من مشاهدهاولقطاتها قد شكلت دستوراً هادياً ومنهج عمل للأنظمة الديكتاتورية الشمولية ومن هذه اللقطات والمشاهد التي لا يتسع المقال لذكرها ذلك التشابه الغريب بينمبنى وزارة الحقيقة ومبنى وزراة الداخلية السعودية وأيضاً قتل الفكر عبر نظام تعليمي وإعلامي موضوع بعناية فائقة لهذه الغاية وقيام الأخ الكبير بتصفيةكل من ساعدوه في الثورة وأساليب التحقيق والتعذيب وفكرة شاشة الرصد والتي لربما استوحت منها كورية الشمالية فكرة الراديو الذي لا يمكن إيقاف تشغليهوفقط يمكن التحكم بمستوى الصوت هذا الراديو المركب في منزل كل مواطن كوري شمالي والذي يقوم ببث برامج مدروسة بعناية لتعبئة الجماهير باتجاهمعين ومشاهد أخرى كثيرة من أساليب التعذيب والسجن والتهديد وجعل الناس جواسيس ومخبرين على بعضهم بل حتى على أنفسهم.ولكن اللافت للنظر كان نهاية الرواية والتي فيها يعلن ونستون حبه للأخ الكبير وتوبته مما أقدم عليه هذه النهاية التي يمكن أن تكون غريبة للبعض رأيتهامنطقية ومنسجة مع الفكرة التي وصلت لي شخصياً من الكاتب وهي التركيز على دور الجماعة في الوصول للمجتمع العادل وأن الامل يبقى معقود علىالعامة أي الشعب بأي تغيير منشود للأفضل ودون التحرك العام للشعب فإن أي محاولات فردية كمحاولة ونستون وجوليا للثورة والمطالبة بالحقوق والحرياتسيكون مصيرها الأرجح هو الفشل أو النجاح المؤدي لإعادة إنتاج الديكتاتورية التي تم الثورة عليها ولكن بقالب وصورة جديدة.
1038,Badr El Boudour,"1984... A book that can change you, shape you and reshape you. It doesn't only affect your vision of the world, but even your way of thinking, and the things you think no one could ever change your view or position about them. At the beginning of the book, you're certain that 2+2=4, that any other result is insanity and wrong, inconceivable even, as Winston said: ""How can I help seeing what is in front of my eyes? Two and two are four."" But as you turn the last pages, you realise that you're capable of accepting that 2+2 can be anything: ""Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once.""This book is an emotional and physical torture, playing with your mind and feelings with every new event: making you feel safe in one moment, happy even, then blow it all to dust. Making you think that you're ""the last man"", ""a minority of one"" that isn't lunatic or mad, then show you that your thoughts of superiority can be destroyed under the right treatment. A book that took me more than a month to finish it, although it's not a long novel, but it's a life changing book, and every change needs time.Nineteen eighty-four starts as one of the books ""that tell you what you know already"", then defies what you're certain of, and shows you that under the right circumstances, you can (and will) be reshaped.To conclude, “Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.” "
1039,Anurag,This is easily one of the best books in my library. Orwell's writing is magical. It is a heartbreaking story which is too close to realism and quite frightening in its implications.brilliant book.
1040,Grant,"I enjoyed 1984 when I first read it at school as part of my GCSE English course and even more when I re-read it a year ago. The way someone could write in 1948 about a future we would probably recognise as having become 50% true in the present day is quite remarkable. We see CCTV and state observation as almost run of the mill now and with the advent of interactive tv, holograms, 3D etc George Orwell may have been 60 years before its time but if it was written now it would seem almost unadventurous. It is far from that. "

1042,Patricia,"I enjoyed this book for the some of the same reasons as most who have read and enjoyed this book: we're always being watched even when we think we aren't. What rings so true about this book is the metaphor portrayed by Big Brother. Although some things in this book may mirror our reality, other aspects of the book I find to be especially interesting. Love, betrayal, fear, surveillance: these are all themes found in this book and that's what I most appreciate about this book. I highly recommend this book! "
1043,Obsessive Compulsive," For more reviews, please visit my blog Obsessive Compulsive Reader   To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men are different from one another and do not live alone - to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone:  From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of Big Brother, from the age of doublethink - greetings! Words escape me as I try to put down on paper my thoughts on this book. Animal Farm is a novel that stayed with me, even though it has been years since I studied it in year 9 English. And if I am blown away by that, what would I think of George Orwell's masterpiece?In short, it is amazing. To say that my eyes have been completely opened wide would be an understatement. Never have I had to think so hard whilst reading a novel. Orwell has crafted such an intricate and frighteningly real society in which Big Brother and the thought police are always watching you. This is a dystopian society at its finest. It's perfect. It's impenetrable. And there's nothing anyone can do about it.The characters are all extremely ordinary - in appearances, personality and careers. They hold no special abilities or secret plans to overthrow the government. Yet they are so believable and realistic that I couldn't help but grow attached to them.And the message within this book. At first they didn't make any sense. War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. These three short sentences sound almost like oxymoron. However, once I finished the book, they make so much sense that it's actually quite scary. The world created in 1984 is not impossible. And perhaps that's what's so haunting about this book.However, for fans of modern dystopian YA-fiction, this may not be what you are looking for. There is no action-packed plot or soul-consuming romance. !984 is a classic and you should approach it as such.This is definitely one of the best books I have read this year. I cannot stress how amazing this book is.  Obsessive Compulsive Reader  "

Ignorance is strength. So is the remarkable and horrifying world of 1984. One of the finest novels ever written. George Orwell was a genius. "

1052,Jonah," 1984 by George Orwell is a fantastic tale about a dystopian society under the rule of a tyrannical government called Big Brother. In this world, Big Brother has created the ultimate dictatorship. They recreate history to fit what Big Brother says is right, use brute force to forge every citizen into a mindless zombie, and outlaw all things that let a human prosper. In this story, a man name Winston starts to question the core beliefs of his society. He is eventually caught and tortured for months until he is broken and completely under the influence of Big Brother.  When George Orwell originally wrote this book in 1949, he used it to issue out a warning prophecy about the future. Orwell had experienced the Soviet Union first hand and predicted a future where a government had complete control, and used their power to insure that they would rule forever. Orwell's nightmarish prophecy has not come true yet, but their is definitely a chance for something like it to arise in the near future. We need to be careful so we all don't end up like poor old Winston, a mindless zombie.  For me, 1984 challenged how I view the world. I could relate a majority of the story to the world I live in today. Sometimes when I finished reading, I would get up and imagine that the Thought Police were coming after me! George Orwell was an extremely smart man and a little crazy too...you had to be to create a world like Oceania! Anyone looking for an exhilarating and challenging read, I highly recommend this book. This is a book that will keep you at the edge of your seat, and then make you fall right off! It's THAT good. I'll never forget this amazing read which has completely transformed how I view people, life, and government. Over and Out,Jonah "
1053,Tim Giauque,"Is there a novel written in the twentieth century with as much relevance, as much lasting impact, as 1984? Just think of all the terms and concepts from this book that have entered regular usage in our language – doublethink, Big Brother, thought crime, even the term Orwellian.This was my first time through this classic, and I really enjoyed it. I can only imagine the impact it had on audiences in the forties, when it was published, and even to modern readers it's unfortunately all too easy to find many modern parallels to the totalitarian Oceania government. Obviously big totalitarian governments like that of North Korea are obvious touch points, but I think one can also find 1984 analogies in Britain's surveillance state or Enron's web of lies. I really liked the details about the Newspeak language, and how the Oceania government was working to dismantle and render obsolete the “oldspeak” English language. What seemed initially to me like a pointless busywork task instead becomes a vital tool in the complete destruction and control of the thoughts and minds of the populace. It really is a scary concept. Many of the book's control methods were obviously insidious, but this one seemed a little more subtle to me.As shocking and terrifying as 1984 is, it's a book that should be read by everyone, everywhere, to arm the people with the knowledge to fight against encroaching tyranny by recognizing it whenever it appears."
1054,Danny Yang,"First of all, I have to apologize in advance as I am terribly inefficient with finding words adequate to describe my emotions for a novel that I read a while back and will definitely read again! That aside, that unforgettable ending was so powerful and awakening that I actually had to put down the novel, gaze through the foggy window, and ponder my existence. In all seriousness, I, as the typical reader who expects the usual happy ending in which the protagonist rides off into the sunset with his princess after vanquishing the bad guy, was very crest-fallen to see the proud and resilient Winston to eventually crack after rebelling for so long against the omniscient, oppressive authority of Big Brother and even dies LOVING Big Brother. This dystopian novel by Orwell accurately emphasizes just how easily the general public can be deceived with empty promises and, more importantly, how valuable free will and the ability to question the status quo really is. One of my favorite quotes within the novel sums it up best: ""Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.” "
1055,Khloud Khalid,"Review first published at: https://bookwormrambling.wordpress.com/When I started reading this book, I didn't expect it to end up on my favorites list. I had heard a lot about it, and had several people recommend it to me. But then again, I never end up liking popular books anyway. Still, I thought I’d give it a chance. George Orwell’s ‘1984’ is the most disturbing, depressing book I have ever read. Also, the most brilliant thing you could ever read. This one is truly worthy of being called a classic.In his book, Orwell managed to capture dictatorship in its darkest forms. He created this hauntingly realistic dystopia that forever scars you and changes your view of our current-day world. In George Orwell’s ‘fictional’ world, extreme totalitarianism is the way to go. Leaders have complete authority over individuals and control as many aspects of both their public and private lives as they could possibly manage. The state monitors and controls everything you do starting from your work right down to the most basic things like what you get to eat and drink, when and how long you get to sleep, how you talk, what you say and think, what you do in your pastime, your ambitions and desires, basically everything that you would call living. Your life is not allowed to deviate from a preset manual that is forced upon you by the state. The slogan of the Party, or the government if you will, is “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.”In the world of ‘1984’, the whole human population is divided under three superpowers. Oceania (where the novel is set), Eurasia, and Eastasia. The three states adopt pretty similar ideologies and possess equal amounts of power. And the three states aim to obliterate the other two and gain complete control of the world. But that would never be possible because they are all aware of their mutually assured destruction. And so, the three states are at constant war with each other, but never directly so, just enough fighting on the borders or on ‘inferior’ grounds to keep the alarming sense of war necessary to stay in control over their followers. “War is Peace”.In Orwell’s world, the state’s strongest oppressive tool is the ‘Thought Police’, armed with telescreens that are forced into every home to broadcast and brainwash the masses as well as constantly spy on their every breath, the Thought Police is practically invincible. You are never allowed to turn off the telescreens. You are never allowed the tiniest bit of privacy. You are never allowed to deviate from the glorious path of ‘Big Brother’. Human relations in their common form become an impossibility too. You can’t trust a single soul, and you’re not trusted either. Your own children would not hesitate to turn against you at the faintest hint of individuality or ‘abnormal’ behavior. Even language as we know it is not the same. It is heavily modified to serve the purposes of the totalitarian state, to kill any form of self expression or ‘thought crime’ as they call it. They control the past when they rewrite it to serve their current purposes. And by controlling both the past and the present, how can the future escape their iron grips? The ‘truth’ becomes obsolete, there is no real truth when it is always changing. The truth is what Big Brother says it is. And if moments later he declares it to be untrue, you take that declaration at face value and never even for an instant question it. In fact, you possess no memory whatsoever of him ever saying otherwise. If Big Brother says 2+2=5, that is what it is then, and that is what it has always been. The only way you can save yourself is by being a slave to the system and blend within the ‘Party’. “Freedom is Slavery”.The gap between social classes has never been bigger, and that would never change. The middle class wants to be part of the elite, empowered by the low class citizens, they will attempt to dethrone and replace the high class. Subsequently, a new middle is created while the low class remain as they are after serving their purpose as an elevating tool for the old middle. They remain purposefully ignorant and uneducated so that they never get smart enough to revolt and recognize the unfairness of the system. And if they do, well there’s always torture, violence, and all sorts of intimidation and brainwashing to solve that problem, executed by the Thought Police of course. “Ignorance is Strength”.George Orwell took everything that is wrong with the world, magnified it to the largest scales, and presented his readers with the most terrifying yet very compelling wake up call, an eye-opener that shocks your very core. You cannot help but think of the mess we created of our world while reading this book. It will force you to see things differently, to evaluate and re-evaluate your world views, and to marvel at the brilliance of its writer. I can never do it justice in just one post, but I do believe that this is a book every human alive should read at least once."
1056,Edward Wolfe,"I read this book when I was young and I think it left a deep mark on me. I've been into dystopian novels ever since.If you haven't read it, it's a must-read for everyone.If you're really young and haven't read it, it's a futuristic novel (because it was written in 1948) about an all-powerful central government that controls everything in the citizen's lives and it manipulates their emotions, watches their every move by way of big screen TVs in every house (pretty cool imagination for 1948, huh?) and one of the biggest projects the government is engaged in is trimming down the English language. The idea of that is, if there was no such word as ""rebellion"" for example, and you never heard of the word, then you'd be less likely to ever have rebellious thoughts.They also make people who are enemies of the state disappear, and then proceed to remove every record of that person's existence. I apologize for this not being a proper review, but I'm sure there are tons of others if you were needing one and were unfortunate enough to stumble on this one.Better yet, just skip reviews and read the book. You won't be disappointed."
1057,اية محمود Aya Mahmoud,"And finally finishedit will take me at least half year to recover enough to be able to read dystopian novels again.and now to George Orwell's master piece 1984let's just say that in the very end it reminded me of a small play called the river of madness and how the king in the end decided to be like everyone else and drink from the poisoned river and become a madmanexcept that in order for Winston and Julia to be as mad as the Big Brother and the Inner Party wanted them to be -which was the Party's definition of sanity- they did have to drink from a poisoned river, they had to go through a horrible and long process of physical, mental and emotional horror.and as the leader and the decision-makers around the world are getting as obsessive about power as Orwell foresaw they aren't getting as smart and I have no idea whether it was a good thing or a bad thing.وأخيرا خلصتهاوهاخد عالاقل ست شهور عشان اتعافى واقدر اقرا روايات نقيض اليوتوبيا تانيالرواية في جزءها الأخير فكرتني بمسرحية نهر الجنون لتوفيق الحكيم وازاي الملك في اخر المسرحية قرر انه يبقى زي الكل ويشرب من نهر الجنونالفرق ان عشان ونستن وجوليا يبقوا في درجة الجنون اللي الأخ الأكبر والحزب عاوزينهم يكونوا عليها -واللي تعتبر النوع الوحيد والدرجة الوحيدة من العقل من وجهة نظر الحزب- المسألة مش هاتقف عندهم على الشرب من نهر مسموم، لكن لازم يعيشوا تجربة شنيعة من الفزع والتعذيب الجسدي والعقلي والعاطفيوفي الوقت اللي القيادات وصناع القرار في العالم بيوصلوا فيها لدرجة الهوس بالسلطة اللي اورويل وصفها وتنبأ بيها نقدر نقول انهم ماوصلوش لنفس الدرجة الذكاء اللي هو وصفها في الرواية وبصراحة انا مش عارفة اذا كانت دي حاجة كويسة ولا وحشة."
1058,Teen & Young Adult Zone,"Teen ReviewGenre: Dystopian NovelSummary: Winston Smith is a man living in Oceania, a country controlled by the Party and Big Brother. He questions the Party and thinks against it, committing thoughtcrime. When he has a love affair with Julia, he is caught by the Party. He is brought before O'Brian, a Party member, and is cured of his internal rebellion. He comes to love Big Brother.Review:This book is a prime example of a dystopian novel. It makes you think about Man's lust for power, and what that may cause. It shows you how a government can go to great lengths to achieve ultimate power. Concepts like doublethink and thoughtcrime are creative ways of displaying how people can be controlled by government. Overall, the novel gets you thinking about government, and does this in a way that engages you and makes you not want to put the book down. People might like this book if they liked: The Hunger Games, Animal Far, Fahrenheit 451, Divergent, MatchedReviewed by Ben"
1059,Linah,"Might contain spoilers if you are picky, but if you aren't there are hardly any.This is a great book in the sense that it is thought-provoking. It really makes you think and compare and understand concepts such as power and freedom. There are different, for lack of a better word, elements to the book. There's the narrative of the protagonist, there's a detailed description of the ""Party"" (the name of the oligarchical regime in the book), and there's a thorough explanation of how systems work, the role of people, war, etc. There's a part of the book dedicated to language of Newspeak. The fictional language of Newspeak was made to restrict thoughts and control human minds. It's very interesting how the abolishment of certain words and the creation of simpler words can do that. There's an appendix on the language of Newspeak at the end of the book which explains it further.A lot of this book brings perspective about regimes and how authority and control can be utilized to the full capacity. It makes one compare current totalitarian regimes to the Party and Big Brother. Of course, the Party is an extreme but I cannot help but see in it a lot of the Saudi way of doing things (or governing, to be more exact). I really loved the plot and the transitions of the storylines. There's a lot of suspense and surprised which I loved. I also loved the ending because of how unexpected it was. The author just has a way of spinning the story and putting enough fact and fiction.I now understand why this novel is such a big deal. There have been a lot of terms based on the book. Orwellian now describes anything of social injustice, individual restrictions, control through propaganda, etc. Big Brother, the fictional leader of the Party, has also been used to describe anything from government control, surveillance, and censorship.It is not a light read and I wouldn't recommend this for everyone. If you are interested in politics, political systems, and wouldn't mind reading a thoroughly depressing novel - then this is for you."
1060,Nadya,"When people ask me which is my favourite book I immediately think of this one, not for any other reason but for the fact that when I finished it I felt sadness, fear and shame all in the same time. I then started crying and couldn't pull myself together for 20 minutes..."

1064,Rajjat Jain,"First Orwell I've read. As perfect as any writer can get. The prose is relatively straightforward but it reads like every word is placed exactly where it should be. Superb read, definitely recommended."
1065,Owaiz,"I have no idea what/how to rate this one. I've read several dystopian novels and always wished to live in those worlds: Hunger Games, Divergent, et al. But this, this truly is dystopia; this is a world I would never wish to live in.The writing is good though the prose is really boring sometimes; or that's my lack of interest in political theories. The pace is rather slow in the first two parts but picks up in the third. Definitely recommend reading to those who love dystopia. Five stars for a world that truly is dystopian. "
1066,John Bowen,"'It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.'Is there any better opening line to a novel? I don't care what Ishmael says I can call him. This is the one.You'll find Orwell's chilling vision of totalitarianism as fresh today as the day it was published. The milieu of Winston's concrete grey, war starved existence could be anywhere, anytime. Technology retarded by circumstance (viewed by contemporary standards) or state is employed to observe and intimidate the populace. Its 1984's questions as to the nature of truth that really electrify, though. What does truth mean when no record can be trusted, when no person is fearless enough to contradict even what their own memory recalls? Not content with controlling its peoples outward existence Big Brother wants to control the way they are even permitted to think. Their desires, their language...If you haven't read it, read it.Because we've always been at war with Oceania, right?- John Bowen is the author of 'Where the Dead Walk' and 'Vessel'. You can find him here on GoodReads, and his published work at Amazon."
1067,Ruth Govaerts,"Ik ben heel blij dat ik dit boek eindelijk gelezen heb (dat werd tijd!). Heel eigenaardig hoe een boek dat gepubliceerd werd in 1949, in kader van het stalinisme en nazisme, zo actueel kan zijn. Termen als ‘Big Brother’ en ‘Doublethink’ zijn de dag van vandaag niet weg te denken. Natuurlijk niet in de extreme vormen zoals beschreven in deze novel, thank God. Maar ze zijn hoe dan ook aanwezig in onze social media, sociale controle, de eenzijdige nieuwsmeldingen en het oorlog voeren in kader van de globalisering en het kapitalisme. Ik ben erg blij dat wij de dag van vandaag kunnen en mogen ‘denken’. Macht en rendement blijven naar mijn mening een té belangrijke rol spelen, maar we hebben gelukkig de mogelijkheid om kritisch in het leven te staan en zo nu en dan zelfs te genieten van een glaasje wijn, een romantische relatie en (jawel!) seks die niet in functie hoeft te staan van het krijgen van kinderen (hoera!). Die kritische kijk op de wereld kunnen we ontwikkelen door bijvoorbeeld dit soort boeken te lezen, dankjewel daarvoor Orwell! Ik zou je trakteren op een biertje (geen victory gin) als je nog zou leven. "

1069,Muhammad Moneib,"Orwell's Blueprint for Absolute TotalitarianismOrwell's fictitious totalitarian state and its mysterious, omnipotent and omniscient Big Brother has long been features of our pop culture and political discussions. They are the embodiment of our worst fears about a time in the future when we would lose our most basic rights amid the increase in the power and influence of governments. Some may reject such notion as too pessimistic or paranoid, yet with the current surveillance technologies, we are usually being watched without us even noticing. In that sense, Orwell's novel should be treated as a heads up -- a call for guards against any attempt to invade our privacy and deny our basic rights.In the years prior to the second world war, communism was still on the rise and the cold war was looming clearer than ever. The rise of super powers have led many to believe that the days of scattered countries were numbered in the face of imminent annihilation by the massive nations. Orwell was worried that, to cope with such changes, Britain might have to change, even if that would mean turning into a monster against its own people. He wrote 1984 with such nagging worries hovering around his head, envisioning a near future when everything would change so drastically into a state of inescapable totalitarian dystopia, a place where it is not even safe to keep one's thoughts inside his head.He called this place Oceania, a massive nation consisting of the Americas, Britain, southern parts of Africa, and Australia. Oceania is controlled by a powerful single party, with Big Brother as the head of state. The Party rose to power in the 1950s after the collapse of capitalism, and it holds its tenure as the manifestation of the principles of English socialism, or Ingsoc. While English is still the widely used language of the masses, it has faced a steady erosion into a rudimentary form known as Newspeak. The society is divided into three classes: the Inner Party, the Outer Party, and the Proles, while governance is achieved through four ministries: the Ministry of Plenty, the Ministry of Truth, the Ministry of Peace, and the Ministry of Love.Winston Smith lives in London, an Outer Party member, working in the Ministry of Truth as a clerk in the Records Department. He lost his family members in some mysterious circumstances and was brought up through governmental programs. His work involves editing historical documents to conform with the present propaganda. Such mutability of the past is an important theme in Orwell's novel, portrayed as the corner stone of the Ingsoc principles and the tool by which the Party remains vigilant at any thought and immune from any deviation. As Orwell puts it: “He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.” Just like any Outer Party member, Winston's life is under continuous surveillance, even when at home, through the telescreen -- a device which transmits and receives audio and video. Every part of Winston's apartment is within the scope of the telescreen except the tiny corner beside it, where Winston sits sometimes to practice the illegal act of thinking. Any slight change in expression in front of this device may hint for a pensive mood, giving the ""thought criminal"" into the hands of the Thought Police, guilty of a crime usually punished by death. Winston is reminded with this harsh truth through the poster of Big Brother's face on the wall, looking at him apparently in every direction, with the words ""Big Brother is watching you"" beneath it.Winston, struggling with the lack of freedom in his home and the deceptive nature of his job, begins to cast his doubts upon the system, resorting to the rather revolutionary act of writing a personal journal of his political thoughts while in his hidden corner, as well as going for walks into the Proles quarters where there is no telescreens, but with the risk of being caught by patrols. He searches for the truth everywhere: in the places, in the pictures, and in the eyes of his acquaintances, but everything seems fake or obscured. The only hope, he writes in his secret journal, is for the Proles to revolt, but even that is impossible as he acknowledges. His thoughts wander further to the possibility of a revolt from within the party, as he becomes convinced that O'Brien, an Inner Part member, is a conspirator. This is reinforced by the revelation to him by Julia, a colleague that seemed to be a staunch party supporter, that she is against the Party.Winston's and Julia's love affair takes place in shady places and at distant intervals. He finds her as a solace to his painful solitude after the estrangement of his previous wife, who was committed to the Party principles to the point that she practiced her relationship with her husband out of sense of duty, rather than affection. Julia was the total opposite. While she lived publicly as a member of the Anti-Sex League, her secret life was full of love affairs. Winston was amused by that love for sex, which during this times, was reduced to merely a ""political act."" However, his amusement of Julia's attitude didn't hold to her political convictions, as she wasn't interested in overhrowing the party or revolting against the status-quo, calling her as ""only a rebel from the waist downwards.""The story takes its way towards conclusion starting from them finding a secret room among the Proles to conduct their love. Through this room we learn about the past prior to the revolution and the hope for the future driven by the sounds of the neighboring Proles, and through the relationship we learn about the distinction between thoughts and feelings, and their roles in constituting what is freedom. Winston's and Julia's contrasting characters make us discover the variety underneath the Party's molded characters, yet it proves to us that no matter how different human beings are, they act the same under the urge of their basic necessities.Orwell makes no effort to conceal their fate. From the beginning of the story, Winston was convinced that no change could happen in his lifetime. ""We are the dead"" was his assurance to Julia. Yet the uncertainty lies in whether their efforts would reciprocate to future generations or fall short to surpassing their time. Could they survive long enough in Big Brother's blind spot? Can they join the alleged Brotherhood and conspire against the party?Contradiction, reduction and uncertainty are the main elements that constitute the logic of Nineteen Eighty-Four. The contradiction is evident in the names of the four ministries: Ministry of Peace is for war, Ministry of Abundance is for scarcity, Ministry of Truth is for propaganda, and Ministry of Love is for policing and torturing the citizens. What makes this contradictions believable in the minds of the citizens is the reduction of their brain activity, formulated brilliantly by Orwell through the reduced language of Newspeak, which is basically English without all the redundancies and varieties that allow different thinking, and with all political terminologies removed. Instead, a limited new vocabulary was introduced to emphasize the normality of contradictions, like the word ""doublespeak.""Practicing doublespeak involves a subconscious belief in the validity of the party's actions, and a usually conscious disregard of any fact that may put them in question. The ability to do so is the difference between a conformist and non-conformist citizen, and the ability to do so efficiently is the difference between living a blissful life or vaporizing into obscurity (""vaporization"" is Orwell's word of being erased from existence). Hence, the mutability of the past becomes possible, and with it reality becomes subjective. That's how uncertainty is brought into the equation, because there's no absolute truths except what the Party says, and even that is subject to change in the future.With these tenets, Big Brother controls the masses. Yet, Orwell takes them to the extreme by questioning the existence of Big Brother as a person, and the validity of the year 1984 as the year in which the story takes place. He uses other red herrings to cement such mood. This atmosphere of uncertainty, where, for example, not even the fiercest supporter of the regime can be certainly safe from prosecution, is a characteristic of every authoritarian regime, because it implies the power of the rulers to do whatever they like, and the inability of the ruled to even rest assured that they are in a secure position. The more insecure a citizen feels, the more he clings to the promise of providing security, even if those who promise are the ones who denied it in the first place.A few chapters of the novel are dedicated to the discussion of the political situation in 1984, including the three super nations, their politics, and their continuous wars. These chapters contain detailed explanation of Orwell's worst case scenario regarding world politics. Small nations are annihilated by three super nations, each with their own of absolute authoritarian conduct. Their continuous wars are nothing but a mean to get rid of any surplus, so as to keep the public engaged in constant fear, and avoid it becoming too comfortable and develop an ability to think beyond the status-quo. He describes how this state global dystopia arisen on the ruins of -- and in a way due to -- capitalism; they took the good ideals of socialism as their advertised principles just to take hold of power: “Power is not a means; it is an end,” he writes. Wars become irrelevant as each super nation is invincible; hence, ""War is Peace."" The only way to be free is to abide by the rules; hence, ""Freedom is Slavery."" And the more blissful you are, the more powerful is the Party; hence ""Ignorance is Strength."" The three sentences form the motto of Oceania, and define its inescapable, subjective reality. Orwell's writing may lack the exquisiteness of the great classics writers, yet his concepts are both mind-boggling and far-reaching. His well-crafted storytelling renders the efficiency of his imagined totalitarian regime; perhaps that's why many use the term ""Orwellian"" to describe similar states. His futurism embodies the sum of all our political fears and even those that we might not be aware off. His deep pessimism is well rooted in reality, and his conclusions are well accustomed with what's known about human psychology. Nineteen Eighty-Four, therefore, is a scary read that requires a determined reader to finish it and grasp it to the fullest. He would then realize that it is all the more scarier, not only because of its dystopian atmosphere with its gruesome details of injustice and the feelings of servitude, but because it is all but possible."

1072,Carolyn,"Just re-read this (as a lead-in to my read of 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami) and continue to be amazed at George Orwell's prescience, with many small details even more relevant today than in 1984. Still worthy of 5 stars even after all these years."
1073,Pial,"Masterfully written, deeply entertaining, and hauntingly eye opening. This is Orwell at his best. The beginning of the book was, as I remember it, a little slow. As the plot progresses though, the book is impossible to put down. The book is an interesting allegory on the world wars and their resulting futility. Orwell takes totalitarian to a whole new level. Though one can extract conspiracy theories or make radical speculations after reading the book, this, I'm sure, wasn't Orwell's purpose; rather, to criticize those governments that engage in the inanities of war and to uncover war for what it really is. That is to say, enlighten the mind of the reader to see things a bit differently; to question authority, and to formulate personal opinions (instead of being spoon fed them). Orwell's command of writing is especially shown when he incorporates the forbidden book into his progressing story. The change of syntax, tone, diction, etc., is amazing. If presented separately, one would find it impossible for them to be of the same author. Throughout most of the story, there lurks ambiguities. However, the end ties it all together perfectly. The ending was absolutely one of the best best I've read. It was like being punched in the face. Read it, you'll know what I mean. Orwell doesn't' believe in happy endings. All in all, one of my favorite books. Orwell is a genius of the highest caliber and his writings more than proves it."
1074,Claire Dauenhauer,"1984 is one of the best books I have ever read. To me, it is without a doubt the best book available in the dystopian society genre. 1984 offers new views on people and the government, none being particularly optimistic. This book is a great warning for people to be wary of the government and not to follow it blindly. It also shows us that people can be broken, and that, in the end, you will always put yourself above everyone else. In this book, George Orwell very clearly lays out his views on human nature. In his view, we are selfish, dumb, and blunt creatures. This book was very disturbing and creepy as well. The whole time I read it I couldn’t’t help but think of how the government could be watching us just as they did in the book. Especially with today's technology, how easy it is to imagine that the government could be listening to our every conversation and tracking our every move. This book is truly a timeless classic that I will never forget."

1076,Yang Ming Wen ,"To someone having personal experience with the ""Chinese Cultural Revolution"" (or at least someone with the second-hand experience from accounts of the older generation), this book was no political fiction, this book was political fact. China in the 60s and 70s of the last century, resembled Oceania in its domestic life to an astonishing degree: fanatic worship and blind loyalty to the ""Great Leader"", unfounded hatred to other countries with different ideologies, constant fear of all-out nuclear war with other major powers, fabrication of production numbers, denouncement of family members with suspected unorthodox thinking, destroy of all objects symbolizing the ""Old Culture"", simplification of the traditional Chinese characters, and many more.The ""Chinese Cultural Revolution"" was a closer resemblance to Oceania than the ""Russian Great Purge"" and the ""Pol Pot Genocide"", as the latter two focused more on eliminating political heretics, rather than stupefying the general population through brainwash.The first simplified Chinese edition of this book didn't come until 1985, and was positioned as anti-USSR book, and was classified as ""Internal Material"" only meant for certain group. It didn't popularize in China until early 21 century. "

1081,Jonathan Jordan,"George Orwell’s 1984 is a great read for patient readers who like to have a large understanding of the time leading up to the story. The book is hard to get into but the narrative that Orwell gives in the beginning serves to further the development of the plot later on in the story. One of strengths of this book is the understanding of how the events impact the characters later in the story. The second half of the book was enjoyable, but it was frustrating to get started due to the lack of dialogue in the beginning of the book. This book is especially interesting to people who like stories about overcoming struggles and hardships. I would recommend this book to patient readers who like to have a great understanding of the plot."

1084,Jeremy,"""Winston watched them disgustedly. And yet, just for a moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats! Why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered?” “It struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy but always against one’s own body.”“Only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone.”“‘It’s the one thing they can’t do. They can make you say anything – anything – but they can’t make you believe it. They can’t get inside you.’”“The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Even since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society.”“The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labor. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.” “There are therefore two great problems which the Party is concerned to solve. One is how to discover, against his will, what another human being is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand.”“The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already.”“But no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimeter nearer.”“For the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one’s own infallibility with the power to learn from past mistakes.”“It was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people under the sky were also very much the same – everywhere, all over the world, hundreds or thousands of millions of people just like this, people ignorant of one another’s existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly the same – people who had never learned to think but were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world.”“It was more natural to exist from moment to moment, accepting another ten minutes’ life even with the certainty that there was torture at the end of it.”“Perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen: that was the thought that defeated him.”“That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better.”“They pretended, perhaps even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end.” “If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face – forever.” “What knowledge have we of anything, save through our own minds? All happenings are in the mind. Whatever happens in all minds, truly happens.”"
1085,Cristina Coelho,"Há quem diga que as melhores histórias já foram todas escritas, um clássico é sempre um clássico, e há um motivo que faz de um livro um clássico: a história é eterna? Estará espetacularmente bem escrito? Foi um livro que revolucionou uma geração?Não sei, mas 60 anos depois de o livro ter sido escrito, continua super atual. Se há algo que me preocupa, é a chegada de um tirano ao poder.Sem falar na falta de liberdade e na política imposta, das coisas mais me impressionaram no livro é chegarmos um dia a um ponto em que algo que sempre tomámos como garantido na nossa alimentação deixar de existir: chocolate, café, manteiga, vinho, há que controlar tudo, mas como não podia deixar de ser há sempre um mercado negro. Aliado a isto como não é só necessário alterar o presente, há que alterar também o passado, por isso é necessário reescrever tudo quanto foi noticia, tudo quanto são histórias, para que as gerações futuras só conheçam a realidade.O lema ""War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strengh"" pode ser lido nas ruas de Londres, em 1984, o mundo deixou de ser o que era, Inglaterra deixou de ser o que conhecemos. A tirania chegou ao poder, o partido que governa vigia toda a gente ""the big brother is watching you"", all the freaking time.No meio disto tudo, a personagem principal, Winston, começa-se a revoltar contra o regime e não quer ser mais uma marioneta nas mãos do partido, quando conhece Júlia, sabe que não está sozinho e os dois juntam-se nessa luta.Só que para pessoas com ideias out of the box, o partido tem: o room 101.O'Brian é dos maiores vilões que já li em livros, a cena de tortura, foi lida às 2h da manhã em véspera de dia de trabalho, simplesmente não a conseguia deixar a meio.Literatura intensa, definitivamente para maiores de idade, e altamente recomendada para ser lida nos dias de hoje, dada a crise atual que atravessamos. Preparem-se para o fim, a mensagem que passa... não é fácil de digerir...Sem dúvida dos melhores livros que já li até hoje. Por algum motivo é ""o tal"" clássico."
1086,Sam Klemens,"One of my preferred books to re-read, this classic always fills me with joy. Just kidding. It fills me with whatever the opposite of joy is, only I still feel happy because the characters are so real, the setting so scarily applicable and the story so fascinating. I seem to remember reading this in high school which seems ironic. I would not think our government would want kids to be exposed to this given their current stance on the subject. Well it was seven years ago, maybe they've banned it by now. Probably they've banned it by now. I don't even know whether I'm joking or not. And that's why I think everyone should read this. One of my ten favorite books, maybe it even breaks five. Check it out. "
1087,Lars Guthrie,"Last read this as a tween, when it had a powerful effect, probably due in large part to what seemed like steamy sex at the time. What I think I missed back then was its rather direct parallels to Stalinist Russia (not unlike 'Animal Farm'). What was conjecture on Orwell's part in 1949--'doublethink,' rewriting history by erasing past incidents and people, children informing on their parents and an omnipresent secret police force--is now known to be true. Big Brother really was watching. I found this rereading powerful in a new way, not only because of Orwell's prescience, but also his crafsmanship and language. Here he is on the act of reading: 'Solitude and safety were physical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body, the softness of the chair, the touch of the faint breeze from the window that played upon his cheek. The book fascinated him, or more exactly it treasured him. In a sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was part of the attraction. It said what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. It was the product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously more powerful, more systematic, less fear-ridden. The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already.' Marvelous. The Everyman's Library edition also contains an excellent introduction (like all introductions best read afterward) by Julian Symons, a bibliography and a chronology of George Orwell's (Eric Blair's) life."
1088,•alessia•,"Questo è uno di quei bei libri che tutti dovrebbero leggere almeno una volta nella vita, non solo per il piacere di fare una buona lettura, ma anche per far vedere a quali limiti estremi di controllo fisico e mentale e di perversione può arrivare la mente umana. Prima di tutto, devo dire che sono rimasta veramente impressionata dalla sottigliezza di dettagli e di come ogni minima cosa si va ad intrecciare con l'altra fino a creare una trama perfetta. È incredibile il modo in cui l'autore riesca a farti cambiare opinione di un personaggio da una pagina all'altra, proprio come ha fatto con Julia e O' Brien. Anche se all'inizio non è facile concepire la situazione delle persone che vivono in questa società (modernizzata in un modo impressionate per essere stata scritta solamente nel '49) la storia mantiene un ritmo costante per tutta la vicenda, fino quasi alla fine, dove lì il ritmo e i colpi di scena diventano più incalzanti; l'ho trovato noiosetto solo quando riprende le pagine de ""Il libro"", ma non fondamentali e se uno vuole può anche saltarle. Il finale...beh il finale è una cosa a sé. Abituata a libri in cui il bene prevale sempre sul mare, sono rimasta molto sorpresa. Piacevolmente? Non lo so. Però è stata più realistica e più umana come fine di tanti bei libri che ho letto, i quali avevano un finale forse troppo finto."

1090,Eslammohammed,"رررررررررررائعة ومقبضة ونبوئية وملهمة ومؤلمة وكل شىء,سيقتضى من الامر راحة جسدية وفسحة تأملية,فضلا عن صفاء بال لكى اكتب عنها ريفيو لائق,اما الان فمجرد ملاحظات,تقاطعت فيها افكارى مع افكار اخونا فى الموقع والانسانية مايكل جروتشفيلد:)):It strikes me each time I read this book, particularly the opening chapter and certain of the more pivotal scenes, how well it is written for what is essentially a polemical tract. The point isn’t really whether Orwell’s vision is realized or realizable, the point is that, while you are in it, he sells it so well. It is also important to remember that 1984 is not a warning about a possible future, but an exploration of Orwell’s contemporary present, magnified to horrific proportions.1984 is a story about relationships. It is the story of Winston’s relationship with Julia, but also and even more importantly, his relationship with O’Brien. It is O’Brien that represents some kind of fantasy comrade-in-arms to him at the beginning (he even says that he is writing his diary to O’Brien), and it is O’Brien that brings him back into the fold by the end. Ultimately, of course, it is a story of the relationships that build up a conformist state. Simplistic political analyses will mistake the State (or “the System”) for a monolithic object, while slightly more critical perspectives will note that it is “made up of people.” A better analysis of oppression realizes that it is based in relationships, and discusses methods for altering relationships in order to reduce oppression. In Orwell’s bleak world, of course, it is impossible to do so, because the relationships are defined within a context which provides no opportunity for new relations to form – all relationships ultimately lead back to the State, in the culmination of the totalitarian dream. Again, this is probably more useful as a reminder of what is possible in a different context than as a warning of a realizable end to freedom.."

1093,Cwn_annwn_13,"I read this book the first time if I remember right in the late 80s. Its still as great, and scary, as I remember it being. More or less you can combine 1984, Huxleys Brave New World, and Camp of the Saints by Jean Raspail and you have a slightly exagerrated version of the world we live in now. Personally I believe that this book only partially came from Orwells imagination. He was involved in political movements to the point where he went to Spain and fought in the Spanish civil war, went to elitist Universities in England and wrote war time propaganda for the BBC so he had a view of the inside of elites and how they operate. Its such the cliche to say it but I believe this book was written as a warning."
1094,Suhasni Kaul,"In 1984, Winston is a main character in a world called Oceania. It is a type of Utopia where the citizens are constantly watched by the “Party”. The “Party” uses telescreens to watch every citizen and if anyone gives any indication of going against the Party rules then they will mysteriously disappear. The plot has a typical story of having no freedom and being controlled like in a dictatorship. George Orwell demonstrates Winston as a character who is against the Party, but does no physical action besides writing down his own free thoughts. Throughout the book, Winston grows and becomes more daring as he meets a girl named Julia who feels the same as him. Julia helps Winston become more confident about his thoughts against Oceania and soon does more than just write his thoughts down. This amazing novel is able to express the issue about choosing whether to take action based on your own beliefs even if the majority is against them. Winston is a perfect example of being sneaky and crafty about going against a government that gives no individual freedom, and the reader is always on the edge of their seat wondering whether he will succeed or not. Be prepared to go on a journey where a little guy is going against a whole army of big guys!"

Read this novel and understand the danger of being clever and able to connect facts and dates."
1098,Melanie,"I read this novel in Grade 9 as it was required reading, along with Diary of Anne Frank, Romeo and Juliet, The Stone Angel and A Handmaid's Tale. My children have now entered high school and their required reading still includes Romeo and Juliet and Anne Frank however 1984 has been replaced with The Hunger Games, The Giver and Divergent. I am not against any of the new additions. I just believe it would be so valuable to have 1984 and Fahrenheit 465 (I think, it's been 30 years forgive me) as initial backdrops to these new and Hollywood fuelled novels. What is there to say about 1984? A classic and a must read. I have to say...I happened to be in grade 9 in 1984 so....even more thrilling time to read the novel! "
1099,Harris,"1984George Orwell""Freedom is Slavery""The year is 1984. The world is dominated by three World Powers. Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. Winston Smith is from Oceania. Oceania is ruled by a unseen dictator dubbed 'Big Brother'. Big Brother rules the country with an iron grip. His Thought Police catch any rebels who are plotting against him. Winston is a typical Party member. He has a push button brain and is thought to hate by a push of a button. He meets another Party member, Julia and the two become friends. In the end Winston's rebel thoughts get him into a prison and forced into being the typical person.  I loved this book because because it has so much insight. This book relates to many things that are going on right now. There are constant wars on this planet and there is a constant war in 1984. George Orwell understands what is going on and puts it into a book that is interesting and has meaning. You could read a news article any day but you would only read what the government wants you to read. We. You read 1984 you know what's going on and nothing is hidden from you. Big Brother is much like the government we have today. There are many unknown officials who make plenty of choices for us. I personally think that every one should read 1984 so that nothing is hidden form view and the public can understand what is going on in the world outside of their house or thier office cubicle. People who are interested in dystopian science fiction. I know that many people do not like this because it is very slow. It has an older prose that I enjoy because it challenges me, there are not many books that challenge me. In 1984 it shows how people are forced into believing things that the ruler wants them to.Orwell uses such powerful language that I am drawn in. Even though that most people cannot connect to Winston but I can understand why he is rebelling. He wants to make his own choices and he wants to be free from the oppression of the party. He thinks the if he helps the black market he will overthrow the ruling party. Most people in history work with the underground to overthrow rulers."

1102,Lilys,"Finally, I got around to read this book and I wasn't disappointed though I had great expectations. That said it's more like an essay than a novel and the characters -it feels like - are merely there to make the description of the everyday life of an average person living in a dictatorship easier. There is something very terrifying about living in a state where there is no privacy and they have a say in every aspect of the life. The language gets less and less complex and the thoughts follow till everything spirals into emptiness...Orwell is a great talent, the style he uses made the dystopian circumstances seem natural and necessary for long-long pages then made the whole thing laughable, scary. "
1103,Maggie,"This book is one of my all time favorites. I read it (first) @ age 17. Pls note I did not have to. This is the first book I ever threw after finishing. & not out of hatred for the book but, from of the emotion it brought out. "

1107,Marc,"Pretty dense in parts, but a good overall read. Seems to fit in snugly with the other dystopias of that time period. (Some details, like leaving the journal out for another to see, is eerily close to Zamyatin's ""We""). I'm not so sure I agree with the premise that a certain group will seek to keep power but have no desire to keep it in their family. It seems to go against historical and biological experience and pressures. How a group could divorce itself from those tendencies remains unclear.Further, if the inner circle is so advanced in ways of the human condition, why would they consider brain washed (i.e. non-free will) citizens as an acceptable part of their society also remains unclear. If it's because of their lunacy (alluded to), then their society would inevitably fall apart due to that very same lunacy.Yet, it's still a poignant extrapolation of the control of the few over the masses who are too eager to give up their civic (and personal) freedoms for a measure of perceived security and prosperity."
1108,Maddy Mosher,"Let me begin by saying that I do not like Orwell’s books. They are very sad and make me extremely depressed. However, I recognize how powerful, well-written, and politically strong they are. 1984 tells the story of a society that has arisen after the downfall of the United States; it is a society in which the people’s very thoughts are controlled by the Thought Police. Winston lives and works in the society just like everyone else, until he meets Julia and they become lovers and rebels against the government-only to be caught and broken in the end. For me, reading 1984 was, in some ways, very psychological. In this strange society, there is a process called doublethink in which the thinker knows that something is true and then refuses to believe it; he believes instead what the government tells him to. After performing this act of self-deception, the thinker must then doublethink: he must forget that he ever knew the truth and that he deceived himself about it. That was nearly impossible for me to wrap my head around, and it also enraged me that anyone would trick themselves into believing a lie. No matter what the cost, I believe that one must always have their own beliefs-not the beliefs of others. While I did not enjoy reading 1984, I was greatly impressed by its originality. The concepts of Thought Police and doublethink alone, without the rest of the plot, were ingenious. This is an extraordinary book. "
1109,Elham Ghafarzadeh,مضمون اصلی این کتاب بدون شک نوعی آینده نگری برای تمام حکومت‌های توتالیته و دیکتاتوری است که زنگ خطری را برای جوامع آن‌ها به صدا درمی‌آورد. شاهکار ۱۹۸۴ همواره از لحاظ جامعه شناسانه مورد ستایش قرار می‌گیرد. زیرا که نویسنده با جزئیات دقیقی از جامعه، حکومت و مردم داستان را شرح داده است.اورول در این کتاب که شاهکاری‌ست تکرار نشدنی جامعه‌ای را توصیف می‌کند که زیر سلطه نظام توتالیته و تمامیت خواهی قرار دارد که همه جا حضور دارد و حتی در کوچک‌ترین مسائل زندگی مردم نظارت دارد؛ از شکلات و قهوه تا وجود تله اسکرین (صفحه سخنگو) در خانه‌ّها که حتی نمی‌شود آنرا خاموش کرد. حکومت به طور مداوم تاریخ را تحریف می‌کند تا مردم متوجه گذشته نشوند و بپذیرند که زندگی آنها رو به بهبودی است و بیگ برادر تنها امید و منجی آنهاست. حال آنکه در چنین فضای خفقانی اگر کسی دست به عصیان و انجام عملی خلاف مقررات بزند چه سرنوشتی خواهد داشت؟ اورول با آینده‌نگری نسبت به تاثیر حکومت‌های دیکتاتوری و کمونیستی آنچه بر سر جوامع خواهد آمد را استادانه در این کتاب به تصویر می‌کشد.

1112,Bani M,"A fascinating and horrifying roller coaster of a novel. Latter events in particular give the brain so much to mull over, great for breaking down writer's (or reader's!) block. Overall I was more impressed by Animal Farm's simplicity. 1984 is more raw with cutting detail- but still concise, which is a valuable accomplishment for a novel dealing with this subject matter."
1113,Councillor,"“Until they became conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.”""1984"" is a masterpiece of British literature and a strong, terrifying and stunning study of a tortured soul experiencing foredoomed romance, isolation from social affiliation and a hopeless struggle against totalitarianism and the invincibility of the state he lives in. Not only did I enjoy reading it, it also made me think a lot about the instruments of suppression and the numerous ways to manipulate mental activity. While Winston Smith, the main protagonist, will not be reminded as one of the most multifaceted characters (I mostly cared for his fate because of what has been done to him), Orwell's detailedness of introducing the reader to this dystopian world left me stunned and shocked by the possibilites of totalitarianism.Orwell completely ignores any existent ""show, don't tell"" principle, writing thousands of words from a nonfictional viewpoint as part of what is meant to be an eassy from a lexicon on the world's history. Although this chapter explained a lot of important details, it was exhausting to read and nothing I would like to find in a fictional work. In general, Orwell's writing style may be considered to be long-winded, but I consider it to be impressive. As much as ""1984"" is one of those works which I know I will return to at some point in future, George Orwell is - once again after having read ""Animal Farm"" some months ago - one of those authors I will never get tired to read of.4,5 stars, rounded up to 5 stars"
1114,Rawda Hegazy,"I finished this book a few hours ago. I don't think i'll be able to sleep tonight. George Orwell's final novel, 1984, was written amidst the anti-communist hysteria of the cold war. 1984 seems to talk about dictatorship and regimes claiming revolution, but truth is, you can't see any difference between these regime and any what-so-called democratic regime. This novel is filled with bleak cynicism and grim pessimism about the human race. It was a magnificent piece of work, that describes to us how any ideology based on one view can destroy human soul. ""Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else,"" says O’Brien. "" . In the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth."" "

1116,Barbara,F'd me up forever in a good way.
1117,Cassandre Lee,"The genius of 1984 lies in its cynical yet veridical observations about the potential manipulation of an uncritical national population. It's a cautionary fable that feels like it lies only a hairsbreadth from our reality, and Orwell coined such lastingly apt vocabulary to describe the deliberate fallacies needed to induce this fabular dystopia. That said, Orwell's clean prose describes a relentlessly horrifying, bleak, and miserable world, and--spoiler alert!--no one gets a happy ending. It's best appreciated in the style of ancient Greek tragedy, a long slide through the pathetic life of a man set in fundamental conflict with his implacable world."
1118,Zuhair said,يقولون إن الزمن يداوي كل الجراحيقولون إن المرء بوسعه أن ينسى دائمابيد أن اﻻبتسامات والدموع عبر السنينما تزال إلى اﻵن تقطع نياط قلبي
1119,Komal,"
Inequality is the unalterabe law of human life.The ingeniousness of George Orwell (which is a pen name, by the way, did you know? I didn't!) can never be overstated. 1984 is a classic of the dystopian variety and was written in 1948-1949. Orwell/Eric Arthur Blair--sounds weird calling my man that--died two years after his novel was published. That is, to me, a very tragic notion. Glories that are earned after one perishes aren't really glories... This novel is amazeballs. Orwell is a golden writer of the English world and I don't think anyone can top him. Actually, I'm pretty sure no one can top him, considering the amount of trash and garbage inflow in the dystopian genre these days. Contemporary writings, like contemporary humans, are seemingly decreasing in intellect with every passing year and the rate of decreasing intellect only appears to be spinning faster and faster. Humanity, you displease me.""Has it ever occurred to you that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now?""Well, Orwell my hero, I think you've pegged that right. I'm already starting to see the signs of the deliberate, or even unconscious, degeneration of the language you so lovingly caressed in your novel. The world of 1984 has come and gone, and I didn't live to see it, woefully, but your prophecy appears to become more and more valid than invalid as the 21st century slowly rolls over.Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the voice, at the most, an occasional whispered word.I'm not going to expand upon the plot line. That is for prospective readers to step on themselves. It's not dystopia that Orwell creates, it could be a more humanized version of hell, more accurately. The crude society presented in 1984 is beyond the tolerance of any of us. To the liberal West, which has come crashing out of the gates of what they thought was a prison, you most definitely will die out in this society. It's a true horroshow. 'Horroshow' reminds me: the novel bears semblance to A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess. Or, rather, the opposite holds true, since Burgess existed after the cessation of Orwell. Both able writers, both owning a mind with an insight to the worst nature of mankind. ""They can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect.""These sentences, they were written more than 67 years ago. Orwell was a modern writer in an aged age. He described exquisite phenomenons, presented convoluted ideologies and spoke of metaphysics (all of which can be safely said to require a comprehension skill beyond that of our developed world's youths) in the very simplest of manners. If this isn't genius, what is?So ugly, and yet, so civilized.You can't underestimate the emotional range depicted in this book. I myself had never before empathized with the despairs and the desires our character experiences. Almost as if Orwell innovated a whole new set of various sensuality. The very fiber that knits the world of 1984 is fraught with slavery and going against that slavery is a machete in the form of two lovers, Winston and Julia. You will be Winston. You will feel what Winston feels. You will suffer what Winston suffers. You will learn, and then re-learn, what Winston learns and then re-learns. It's not the deviation in practise that George Orwell pinpoints to, it's the deviation of the mind. Of the very psyche that embodies the human nature. It is, in the lowest form, in kinship with solipsism. Solipsism, a word I've seen often, but have conversed with only just now.""I enjoy talking to you. Your mind appeals to me. It resembles my own mind, except that you happen to be insane.""1984 made its dent in my mind. Orwell scratched the surface of my cerebrum.Shh.Big Brother is watching."
1120,Yoyo,"{I'M OFFICIALLY IN LOVE WITH GEORGE ORWELL}The genius of Orwell lies in envisioning the whole situation and creating the strategies of a government that can control its own citizens .The state wants to guarantee 1-blind loyalty and devotion to work by the outer party (middle class)2-poverty and ignorance of the proles (lower class) so they are too weak and ignorant to revolt against poverty,filth&everyday's raids that kills hundreds of them .Also,they have no chance to compare between how they are loving and how people in earlier ages used to live coz all history books are destroyed and rewritten.To put that into practice the state(inner party) takes intensive measures to control the thoughts of the the outer party members including:1-telescreens spread everywhere and every house that watches and hears everything and notices your emotions so you'd better appear happy in front of it .police patrols everywhere in the streets and helicopters also that hover above houses to notice any abnormal behaviour .2-putting their members' mentality in a state of war all the time(although there might not be war) but they want to keep the adrenaline rushin' through their workers to work very hard (for the outer party members)3-almost everything is prohibited from walking in the streets and owning a diary to falling in love..(for the outer party members)4-controlling their thoughts through decreasing the words in the dictionary and by time the consciousness of people will decrease and they won't find words to express their revolting thoughts coz there are no words in their language which mean any of the rebelling thoughts and feelings inside them.Also brainwashing them and everything the government says is true and must be believed(they believe it even if they don't believe it).5-marriage is allowed only(in the outer party's members) to bring children who will be an extension of the thought police and spy on their relatives and parents to see if they are thought criminals and have any opposing thoughts towards the government ..6-controlling the past,all real history books are destroyed and rewritten to make their citizens believe that they are living in the most luxurious era ever and people before were enslaved and tortured by the capitalists.and almost no one knows anything about the real past,old people who lived before the big brother had disappeared all of a sudden in order to never let anyone know about the past.-WHO CONTROLS THE PAST, CONTROLS THE FUTURE.-WHO CONTROLS THE PRESENT, CONTROLS THE PAST.#GOD BLESS GEORGE ORWELL.Don't forget: (BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU).."
1121,Lauren,"The writing is terrific. Its keen ability to engage, to make one contemplate how plausible it is that how an individual's rationality can succumb to the dominating few's absurdity. Is there some system that can effectively arrest the human instincts for friendship and love? In 1984, the superstate of Oceania thrives on this system. In this society, you turn against one another and you turn against your sanity. Children are schooled to be vigilantes for the regime, turning in family members suspected of disloyalty. All relationships are eradicated. Loyalty is only to Big Brother. Is love ever stronger than pain, specifically pain under torture? Orwell illustrates how the answer is a resounding NO. This is a dangerous and convenient understanding in the mind of a juggernaut on the quest for power. And power, not as means to an end, but as an end in itself. The speculative dystopian world of 1984 is not far removed from the world we live in. Rape, torture, executions, concentration camps, warfare--all measures for control and power. Of course there are innumerable other examples, but Big Brother immediately brought to mind North Korea's Dear Leader (because I saw the National Geographic documentary not long ago).* look at that—when paperbacks used to be 60 cents. "
1122,Lensa Mohammed,"I felt like the book was more of an essay and I only say that because the method of storytelling has changed a lot since the time classics were written. However, in the book I was really interested on how Orwell, examined every aspect of the dystopian world, it's bleakness and his use of language because it elicits emotional and intellectual responses as the reader.For example, when 1984 describes the future in a totalitarian state where where thoughts and actions were minutely monitored and controlled."
1123,Marijana Sitar,"“Being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.”P.S. I've never hated a character as much as I hated ONE in this book. I wanted to strangle him (multiple times). And stab him with a knife (multiple times). And that wouldn't be enough. I was pissed during the whole day after reading that particular chapter. Spreading hatred everywhere. :D"
1124,Ghita Benabbou,This is what I call a GREAT book.Here's my review : https://lostbetweenpagesbyghitabenabb... . 
1125,Robert Rohwer,"Oceania, the setting of ""1984,"" is one of the most detailed and realistic fictional settings I've ever read. I'd put it right up there with Tolkien's Middle Earth.There are also too many memorable lines and phrases to list. Being a huge David Bowie fan, I was delighted to read the origins of his song, ""We Are the Dead"" in this book. Some may chastise the book for being too philospophical, or meandering too far from the plot while explaining the culture and backstory of Oceania. I will agree with this sentiment to some degree, but I found those parts to be stimulating diversions that made me buy into Orwell's world even more. Yes, this book is very dark, and the ending is very bleak. But I still found it very enriching and thought-provoking. It is certainly not a balls-to-the-wall adventure, and the story does move slowly. For me, this book didn't need that. I was in suspense the whole time and never felt bored. As a pyschological and social portrait, 1984 is fascinating. I would recommend it to anyone in the mood for a feast for thought. "
1126,DeepThought42,"Wow ! This book absolutely blow me away ! The topic of the total surveillance is more actual then ever before.____I wrote a more detailed review in german:Im fiktiven Ozeanien herrscht die totale Überwachung, es gibt kaum einen Winkel, an dem man vor den „Teleschirmen“ sicher ist. Durch eine systematische Gehirnwäsche, wird die Bevölkerung dazu genötigt die einzige und einzig „wahre“ Partei, die des „großen Bruders“ als unfehlbare Instanz zu akzeptieren und deren Ansichten zu übernehmen. Eine eigene politische, gesellschaftliche Meinung die der Parteidoktrin nicht entspricht, wird nicht toleriert und brutal bestraft. Orwells Zukunftsvision, eines totalitären Staatssystems wurde zu einem zeitlosen Klassiker. Kein Wunder, den das Thema der ständigen Überwachung durch den Staat, sowie der fortschreitende Verlust der Privatsphäre welche wir auch heute, in der realen Welt erleben, hat nichts an seiner Brisanz verloren. "
1127,Sara Soso,"لا يجب ان تعبر روايه بل كانت نظرخ علي نظره علي المستقبل بعد 50 سنه واكثر لان تم كتابتها عام 1949 لتحكي نظره مستقبليه عن 1984 وهي لخصت الحاله العامه في جميع الدول العربيه ب1- في متاهات التفكير الازدواجي ان تعرف ولا تعرف ان تعي الحقيقه كامله ومع ذلك لا تفتا تقص الاكاذيب محكمه البناء ,ان تؤمن برائين في ان واحد وانت تعرف انهما لا يجتمعان ومع ذلك تصدق بهما, ان تجهض المنطق بالمنطق , ان ترفض الاتلزام بالاخلاق فيما انت واحد من الداعين الليها , ان تعتقد ان اليمقراطيه درب من المستحيل وان الحزب وصا عليها , ان تنسي كل ما يتعين عليك نسيانه ثم تستحضره في الذاكره حين تمس الحاجه اليه ثم تنساه مره ثانيه فورا وفوق كل ذلك ان تطبق الاسلوب نفسه علي الحالتين ...... ذلك هو الدهاء الكامل ان تفقد الوعي عن عمد ووعي ثم تصبح ثانيا غير واعي بعمليه التنويم الذاتي التي مارستها علي نفسك بل حتي ان فهم عباره التفكير الازدواجي تستدعي منك اللجوء للتفكير الازدواجي 2- لم يكن من المرغوب فيه ان يكون لدي عامه الشعب وعي سياسي قوي فكل ماهو مطلوب منهم وطنيه بدائيه يمكن اللجوء اليها حينما يستلزم الامر , اقناعهم بقبول ساعات عمل طويله , او حصص اقل السلع التموينيه , بل وحتي عندما كان ينتابهم الشعور بالسخط كما يحدث احيانا فان سخطهم لم يقض الي شئ كونهم يعيشون بلا مبادء عامه ولذلك يركزون غضبهم علي تضلمات خاصه وقليله الاهميه فالاخطار الكبري لا تسترعي اهتمامهم 3- ولكن مجتمعا مثل هذا المجتمع لا يكتب له ان ينعم باالاستقرار طويلا علي ارض الواقع ذالك انه اذا حضي جميع افراد المجتمع علي السواء بالامن , فان العدد الاكبير من البشر الذين يخدرهم الفقر سيغدوا مثقفين وسيتعلمون ان يفكروا لذواتهم وعندما يتم ذلك فانهم عاجلا ام اجلا سيفطنون الي انه لا فائده ترجي من الاقليه صاحبه الامتيازات وسيعملون علي ازاحتها عن سدره السلطه وبالتالي فان المجتمع الطبقي لا يمكن ان يستمر الا مع الفقر والجهل 4- لحزب لم يسعي الي السلطه الا ان الجماهير العامه مخلوقات ضعيفه هشه تتسم بالجبن ولا يمكنها احتمال مسؤليه الحريه او مواجهه الحقيقه ومن ثم يجب ان يتم تيسير شؤونها و خداعها بطريقه ممنهجه من قبل اخرين اعلي منهم قوه ولكن السؤال هنا لماذا تشبث بالحياه وهوليس لديه اي شئ لا مبادئ ولا قناعات ولا حتي جوليا ؟ وها هي اعظم مخاوفك التي تتحطم عنها كل شئ ؟ "
1128,Susanne,"I remember reading this when I was about 14 or so. I sat in my room and read it in one sitting. I remember the fascination and horror I felt about Newspeak, and the sneaking suspicion that the Norwegian lottery or any lottery for that matter, might be a sham too. I also remember the joy I felt towards the middle/end of the book, when I saw hope for some of the characters. After I finished the book I remember feeling depressed. That ending... one of the most heartbreaking endings ever. It did fuel the cynic in me definitely. I have re-read it, but the first impressions from this book overshadowed everything else. I know I have re-read it, but I can't remember any of my thoughts from that time, it's weird, it's like that only served make the memories from the first time stronger.It's one of those books you should read, if only because you might get where the term ""Big Brother"" comes from (I have had to explain this to people who thought it was coined by the people who made the reality-TV show) For me who was politically active on the far left at that time it was a useful critique of the ideology I subscribed to, but also a critique of any form of ideology or form of government or social structures that take away individual freedoms (or any sort of freedoms really). And a reminder that it's easy to become blind to that oppression if you are to complaisant.Also it's a good place to start if you want to argue with your friends about history and truth and what they mean and indeed if they mean anything, which can be quite fun."
1129,Alexandra Danilova,"finally read one of my favourite books in original and it is more than amazing- it's a brilliant, breathtaking masterpiece. with every page you get more and more absorbed in this dark apocalyptic word of terror and in the end you felt a devastation and shock.""Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows""."
1130,Israel,"For me to truly love a book I must desparately hate the questions that it forces me to ask and tempts me to answer. According to this criterion alone 1984 ranks as one of the best books I've read. I am haunted by so many questions when I recall this beautiful book. Most frightening is the thought of what my Room 101 might be and who I would be willing to sell if I ever went there. More subtle is the question of whether or not I already love Big Brother without being subjected to all of his horrors. Wow, just writing this review makes me want to read it again."
1131,Luigi Del Gesso,"Credo che 1984 debba essere letto assolutamente. Non so perché ho aspettato così tanto prima di leggerlo. Tutti devono metterlo via solo dopo averci ragionato parecchio sopra. L'idea di dittatura ipotizzata da Orwell è micidiale. Completamente diversa da quelle passate. Non più una dittatura fisica ma mentale. Dove non c'è più spazio per amore, felicità, amicizia, fratellanza. Dove addirittura la famiglia perde il suo reale valore. È veramente un romanzo inquietante. Che ti fa pensare che prima o poi una cosa del genere possa succedere veramente. "
1132,Chad Warner,"At the time the book was written, 1984 was the future. In this future, England has become part of the multinational Oceania. The Party rules over the proles (proletariet; working class) and keeps an all-seeing eye over Party members. They are constantly reminded of this surveillance by posters proclaiming that ""Big Brother is watching"". Not only does the Party watch people, but the Thought Police monitor facial expressions and other non-verbal communication to detect thoughtcrime; any thinking that isn't explicitly for the good of the Party. To survive, one must master doublethink: the ability to know and believe two contradictory things. Individual thoughts, actions, and sexuality are forbidden. The language, Newspeak, is composed of a limited vocabulary that limits thoughts and expressions.The book follows Winston Smith as he seeks out The Brotherhood, an underground society working to overthrow the Party's rule.The SparkNotes are very good: 1984.This book and Animal Farm are Orwell's most famous books. Both are dystopian tales of the dangers of a totalitarian government.Similarities between the books:The government knows best.The intelligentsia seize power.The naive proletariat are oppressed and kept ignorant.The government bends or breaks its own rules for its benefit.The government uses propaganda to keep the proletariat in check.The government rewrites history to prove that it's correct and that life is better with the government than it was before the government's rise to power.Both books have pessimistic endings."
1133,Avishek,"A dark, gritty tale which paints such a vivid and ghastly picture that it is at the same time terrifying, horrific and a certain kind of beautiful. Orwell is a genius and a man of detailed descriptions. The way he depicts the dystopian future it is really spine chilling. 1984 is the original dystopian novel which proved to be an inspiration to various novels, stories, and movies over the ages. So, even after all these decades the way it still manages to be relevant is really worthy of all the praise and accolades that is showered upon it. "
1134,Rathiyanka,This book is definitely not a page turner for the most part but the concept it brings home is something that will leave an everlasting impact on you and will linger around in your thoughts whether you like it or not!.And that i think is what a good book is all about.This is again a lovely classic that plays a trick with your mind and thoughts and enchants you with the ideas it put-forth. 
1135,Natalya,"""From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of Big Brother, from the age of doublethink — greetings!""I’ve finished with this novel yesterday evening and still cannot settle my mind. I felt as if my brain was chewed out! ""1984"" I started to read almost immediately after the ""Little Women"" of Louisa May Alcott and I knew nothing about it except that it’s a dystopia. But neither Collins, nor Huxley or Bradbury prepared me for this! After the pink and fluffy Alcott, this novel was like a falling down to earth, with a further dipping into the pit of my personall hell. Yes, hell, as there is nothing worse for me than a full control over the man's reason. And though, in our time the influence of mass media on the trivial minds is huge, and streams of disinformation usually distract - we still have right to the individual thinking. We still have a right to the physical outpouring of our emotions.But not here, not in 1984, not in the Orwell’s world. In this world «Big brother is watching you». In this world it is vital to «Never show dismay! Never show resentment! A single flicker of the eyes could give you away».But this is not enough too. Nobody could control the momentary expression of the eyes, involuntary movement of the head or the most unpredictable - their dreams. And even if it could be - it does not matter, because they know. They already know all your thoughts, they knew everything before you realize it by yourself. So now, there is a little left to do – only teach you to think differently. The learning process gave me the willies and made me hold the breath, I involuntarily cringed to the embryo’s position.In my memory it was the first time, when I pray for the death of lead character as a mercy. It can be agonizing, painful, anything, but not the ""final, necessary healing""! I prayed Orwell, O'Brien, Big Brother (by the end of the book he became almost real for me) for this grace. But no, «even in the instant of death they cannot permit any deviation""!This book has been associated for me with the song - «Mad world» group Tears For Fears:All around me are familiar facesWorn out places, worn out facesBright and early for the daily racesGoing nowhere, going nowhereTheir tears are filling up their glassesNo expression, no expressionHide my head I wanna drown my sorrowNo tomorrow, no tomorrowAnd I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sadThe dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had.I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to takeWhen people run in circles it's a very, veryMad world, mad world"

1141,Desislava,"George Orwell's 1984 is depressing. Very depressing. It is also a breathtakingly awesome work. Despite the heavy subject matter, it's suprisingly easy to read. It is one of the truly essential classics of modern literature.1984 is a timeless novel that makes you question everything from conformity to the government and the media. The first half of the book is a bit slow and stagnant, yet the end section is absolutely frightening and marvelous. This book is brilliant. How relevant is Orwell's message to today?! When you answer that question, you realize why this is novel, written in 1949, is a ""future"" novel.
“The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.” “Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.” “Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.”“War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.”“Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.”“If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.” “If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—for ever.”“The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind, happiness is better.” “Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system. At any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom.”“Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.” “Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull. ”

1142,ahmad  afridi,"what I just read !!! this was haunting and depressing as far as language is concerned just loved the terminologies of newspeak . at start I reread the first few pages because I wasn't getting much the new terms particularly with party slogan , classic example of double think . but these are explained very much in further pages as well as in the appendix about double think ...book was fast paced during the start pages. during the middle (his affair with Julia) book is more concerned with details of their affair and derailed from political description .the last portion of the book is the most brain teasing and depressive .few important things the book discussed history is alterable and alter it to suit you governance. alter that in every existing document and no one can say it is altered. they will say it was the same as described. this alteration is shown in many places through out the novel especially status of war with Eurasia and Eastasia . like they suddenly declared during hate weak that they are at war with eastasia which was contrary to their previous stance (war with Eurasia).they have changes all the records within a weak and""It was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentary evidence that the war with Eurasia had ever happened. ""  another instance of alteration of history was considering killed (book used the word vaporized) as ""unpersons"" (newspeak word) means they never existed or ceased to exist like when he talked of his colleague syme   ""syme has ceased to exist he never existed""  the sort of people party produced due to their continuous propaganda. they stopped using their brains and were just machines acting unconsciously. describing one of his colleague when he was talking to Winston he said 
""The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.""
or when his neighbor parson was caught due to uttering ""death to big brother "" in his dream. he said he will thank the inner party   ""thank you for saving me before it was too late""and just check the absurdity in wordings for description of a hanging "" It was a good hanging,” said Syme reminiscently. “I think it spoils it when they tie their feettogether. I like to see them kicking. And above all, at the end, the tongue sticking right out, andblue -- a quite bright blue. That’s the detail that appeals to me.” how people were deprived of basic need . how pathetic was their ration. the expressions on seeing everyday use items are worth noticing like .. ""I have seen oranges""  ""I can remember lemons they were quite common in fifties"" 
""vine like paperweight or Mr. Charrington’s half-remembered rhymes, itbelonged to the vanished, romantic past ""
 ""I am using the same razor blade for the past few months .I’ve tried all over the place. They don’t exist any longer."" it not like book only contain political talk only there is some romantic sentence also and the one below seems to me more poetic than just phrases .
""With what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside, What overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside. With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture, a whole system of thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and the Thought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm""
 or this sentence , description of the same at another place  ""and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated. ""(view spoiler)[I was disappointed in last by the behavior of Winston . I strongly believed in ""Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull."" was sure he wont let those few centimeters in someone else hands. he disappointed Julia too when she told him "" They can make you say anything -- anything -- but they can’t make you believe it. They can’t get inside you.” . at last they made him believe every thing even they make him love Big brother  (hide spoiler)]"
1143,Gintarė,"1984-ieji yra viena iš geriausių knygų, kurią aš esu skaičiusi ir aš beveik neabejoju, kad ji su manim pasiliks dar labai ilgą laiką. Iš tikrųjų, retai kada atrasi tokį kūrinį, kad atsivertęs bet kurį puslapį galėtum ten rasti kažką tokio stipraus, jog net užgniaužia kvapą. Nors žmonės vertina šią knygą įvairiai, aš nežinau, kaip galima jai skirti mažiau nei maksimumą žvaigdučių/taškų, etc.Mano manymu, vienas didžiausių šios knygos privalumų - tai jos aktualumas. Taip, ji buvo parašyta prieš daugiau nei 60 metų. Taip, laikas, apie kurį rašoma, jau seniai praėjęs. Ir, žinoma, satyra apie komunistinį/totalitarinį režimą galėtų būti pavadinta pasenusia. Bet tik labai paviršutiniškas skaitytojas nepamatys to, kas slypi tarp eilučių. Tik visiškai abejingas jį supančiai aplinkai žmogus nepamatys, kad visa šita satyra visiškai tiksliai apibūdina dabartinį mūsų gyvenimą. Būtent tai ir kelia didžiausią įspūdį ir netgi siaubą.Pabaigai pasakysiu tiek, kad kiekvienas, nors šiek tiek mąstantis žmogus, turėtų perskaityti 1984-uosius. Ne todėl, kad jūs sužinosit kažką naujo, bet tam, kad būtų patvirtinta, jog jūs nesate vienintelis, kuris taip galvoja..."
1144,Ozsu,"It’s a very strong dystopia because evilness does actually bring you power all the time. You wouldn’t expect people to obey you if you’re extremely kind and nice to them, instead you would expect them to take advantage of you. But if you’re evil everyone is scared of you and no one even attempts to disobey you because they realize that the consequences will be worse than their current situation if they rebel to change the it. Julia is one of 'The Whateverists' and I love her for that. Who cares how the Party works if she finds a way to not get affected by it? She's exactly how lots of people are nowadays. People have accepted the fact that lies rule the world and that not much can be done about it."
1145,Tofelle Jipos,"""To know and not to know... to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies...""That was the principal conflict in this frightening tale about a society where thoughts are collective, and reality is dispensable. Consistent from the start to finish, 1984 scarred my mind and revitalized it at the same time. The trumped up futuristic concept by George Orwell might have been debunked so far as one's concerned, but with his playful words, his deep introspection and his enigmatic yet dark writing style, you'll be able to materialize in front of you the vile and delirious world you wouldn't dare to lodge in. A world where everywhere you go, eyes are darted on you, nothing is an escape route except the darkness... Ironic to say, perhaps, that the inconsistencies among characters -- their eccentric attributes, their indecisiveness, their loathsome acts and their askew perspectives, did develop them all throughout the book until the concluding chapters. The villain, though reprehensible in a myriad of things, did actually come out as someone you 'might' possibly look up to. Winston Smith, the protagonist, who for interminable times rendered himself into the dangerous world of consciousness, had started to fend off his indifference. 1984 is a novel for those who are fascinated with bizarre contemplation and unreliable yet captivating narration. This is something that would keep you up every night... wondering as you gaze upon the stars:Who am I to start with? Who am I as my life ends? Who am I as I lie down my grave?"
1146,Jen (The Starry-Eyed Revue),"Read in high school and again as an adult and still love this story. I've probably read the book ten times, at least. This is the book that introduced me to the dystopian genre, and I can't be more thankful for that. Awesome premise, great writing. A true classic in my book."
1147,Lisa (Harmonybites),"This has one of the most striking first lines in English literature: It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. It's an apt first sentence at that--one that immediately warns us we're in a world off-kilter. By the time we get to the end of the second paragraph we're clued in that we're in a totalitarian setting--whether of the National Socialist or Soviet Socialist type--the enormous poster, a world absurd and ground down so nothing works--the run down building called ""Victory Mansions"" and a mention of ""Hate Week."" And then we learn the caption on that enormous poster: BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU. This is arguably the classic work of dystopia modeled on the real things in the twentieth century but set in a future in one of the iconic Democratic countries, Britain, to warn yes, it can happen here. (Or at least the future when the book was published in 1948. The year 1984 has come and gone, and many countries oppressed then, are free now, but there are still many a totalitarian country around today for 1984 to still resonate.) The book gives us a road map and warning sign and many a famous phrase--particularly ""Newspeak."" Orwell through the book warns that above all such regimes corrupt and oppress through the corruption of language. Euphemisms that are obscene in their linguistic twists that limit how you can imagine and articulate protest. resonates today in the very language we fight over: pro-life or pro-choice, affirmative action or racial preferences, enhanced interrogation or torture."

Perry Hall,"Oppression Persisting, Can't Fight this Brain Conditioning""How did we get in so much trouble?Getting out just seems impossible.Oppression is persisting,I can't fight this brain conditioning.""Revolt, Muse, 2009 (inspired by 1984).Newspeak, def., ambiguous euphemistic language used chiefly in political propaganda.Thoughtcrime, def., an instance of unorthodox or controversial thinking, considered as a criminal offense or as socially unacceptable.Doublethink, def., the acceptance of or mental capacity to accept contrary opinions or beliefs at the same time, especially as a result of political indoctrination.While I remembered, from reading this in high school, that 
Big Brother
 came from this novel, I was astounded to realize upon this re-reading that the terms above (and more, now in our lexicon) came out of the pages of this enduring classic, which Orwell obviously aimed at the barbarous, sinister totalitarian communist regimes in place when he wrote it in 1947, primarily the Soviet Union and Stalin. Of course, another word long in common usage is Orwellian, meaning, ""resembling the totalitarian political methods decried in the works of ... George Orwell, particularly in the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four; characterized by use of misleading terminology, propaganda, censorship, totalitarianism, surveillance and repression.""I'd add to this list, Torture -- in its most sadistic form: picture a room full of blinding lights, as a cage crowded with ravenous rats is about to be placed over the renegade's head. The story is gripping, and exceptionally eerie for its realism, in a post-apocalypse setting or not. All post-apocalyptic novels I've read and movies I've seen have borrowed from Orwell and this novel. George Orwell's 1984 was a 
game-changer
 -- among a mere handful."

1155,Cruiseportatlas.com JohnMorn,"Honestly I had avoided this book thinking it had long passages about torture and brainwashing. It does, but before that there is the plot about Winston's political and romantic awakening within a totalitarian state. Feeble as this awakening is, the longing for truth, beauty and love is wonderfully described. There is no romanticism in this book, but there is hope in my view.The book can be read as a prediction or as a cautionary tale. Taken as a prediction it is devastating. As a cautionary tale, it is an expose of man's potential for evil. Written just after World War II, Orwell was taking recent events to their logical extreme. His portrait of a world where personal liberties are snuffed out by a ravenous inner party seemed all to plausible at the moment. Within 1984 is a thorough description of the methods and mechanisms used to create the totalitarian society. Some aspects of this were obvious. Children spy on their parents. Television has no on/off switch and is a two way devise allowing watchers to be watched. Love is anathema because any loyalty other than to the state (Big Brother) is dangerous. War is constant, because there must be an enemy.Where Orwell departed from the obvious is where it gets interesting. The mottoes of the party - War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength - demonstrate how utterly the rulers want to alter reality. The invention of a new and simpler language - Newspeak - shows how this can be done. The book within the book written by Emmanuel Goldstein describes how war has no goal besides creating an outside enemy to distract the people from any other political strivings. And finally, control by the state will not stop at eliminating behaviors. The striving for freedom, love, knowledge and peace must also be destroyed.Ultimately this book is as depressing as I thought it would be.

1156,Meriem Bouraoui,"Having no idea of what this book is going to be about I picked it.And after turning few pages, I realised that I had a miracles in my hands, Orwell is genius, the way he imagined the world, the plot, the characters is just pure awsomeness !Well and so far he has been right about everything although he overstated some details, we're living in a world of slavery, where freedom is just an illusion, and all what's beyond we call forbiden.The best book in English I've ever read."

1158,Ahmad Badr Mesbah,"This is a novel that describes a future world that is fucked up. It is a dystopia or an anti-utopia. Although published in 1948 , I was shocked by how much I could relate many of the book’s event to how our countries in the middle east run nowadays.I didn’t particularly enjoy 1984 as a novel. I found many more novels more entertaining. However, it was a book where I would read a chapter, re-read it again, realize how similar the inner party operates to many modern day governments. Then I re-read again, and get blown away by the genius of George Orwell to analyze accurately how people function in this fiction. I would often sit for extended hours and link Big brother, the inner party, Winston smith, Julia, O’Brien, Goldstein, and the proles to people I know and watch every day on TVs and in the streetThe chapters of the book that had portions of goldstein’s book “The theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism” was the part I enjoyed the most. The way the words “War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is strength” are analyzed is genius. After a lot of speculation, I can probably with some modifications tailor versions of 1984 to what is happening in Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Libya. With one difference, our governments were smart enough to not publicly show ‘IngSoc’. We have our own modern version of IngSoc , and we can’t notice it.The book will blow away anyone who is a fan of philosophy. Is there really any facts in this world? Does anything exists outside of our minds or is reality only inside ourselves. Is 2+2=4 or can it mean 5 or 3. I think i suck at writing reviews, but I wrote this not for anyone, but to remind me of how marvelous this publication was. I will probably re-read the novel again, in Arabic this time. With complexity of this novel, I believe one reading isn’t enough to grasp all ideas of this book"
1159,Mark Lavin,"I just finished reading 1984 again, having read it many times before, but not in the last 10 years. I continue to be alert to the sorts of things Orwell warns us about as they occur, such as cameras in public places, phone taps, the government (particularly the US government, which I respect, but less and less over the years) presenting lies to support their actions (Vietnam, Patrick Tillman's death, etc.), using torture, etc., etc. It is amazing that these dangers could be foreseen in 1947. Perhaps I am naive, but Orwell is incredibly prescient.However, what truly struck me at this reading is the actual writing, and the major concepts that he presents. Another reviewer here mentions it. Orwell's descriptions of what is going on in the human mind (usually Winston's) are so dead on that with only a few words, I know EXACTLY what he is talking about. And with those descriptions, he has identified some basic ideas that are obvious in retrospect, though not necessarily completely valid: The purpose of those in power is power alone; pain makes cowards of us all; if you limit the available vocabulary, you limit the range of thought; there is something for everyone that cannot be tolerated; the only reality is in the mind; the concept of doublethink is valid. There are others. I have read critics indicating that the characters are thin and that the ending is weak or false. I think the story and characters are intended to provide a structure for these ideas, and no more was needed. "
1160,Tempo de Ler,"Que alternativas restam quando nem os poucos «centímetros cúbicos no interior do nosso crânio» nos pertencem? No livro 1984, George Orwell criou uma assustadora reflexão política que evidencia o perigo do totalitarismo, tendo por base o que o próprio testemunhou com os governos Russo e Espanhol.Experienciamos a vida em Oceânia através de Winston Smith, um trabalhador do Partido cuja mente resiste silenciosamente à exaustiva soberania do Partido, mantendo inédito sentido crítico e ânsia por respostas. Neste mundo, todo o tipo de liberdade foi abolida, seja de expressão, de imprensa, de reunião ou até mesmo de pensamento; consequentemente, todos os que forem apanhados a contrariar as diretivas do Partido simplesmente desaparecem, «vaporizam-se», ou são submetidos a uma disciplina intelectual que os obrigará não só a dizer o que o Partido estipula, mas também a acreditar em cada palavra.Além de constantemente vigiados através de «telecrãs» e de microfones espalhados por todo o lado, os cidadãos são submetidos a doses constantes de propaganda política que orienta a forma como devem viver as suas vidas, os incita a odiar todos os que se opõem ao Partido e a denunciar comportamentos que possam parecer suspeitos, incluindo as crianças em relação aos próprios pais. O poder do Partido é reforçado pelo controlo que este detém sobre o passado: alterando constantemente documentos e livros, rebatizando edifícios e até países, modificando datas, impedindo que os cidadãos mantenham documentos/registos/fotografias, o Partido consegue sabotar a memória coletiva e, desta forma, controlar o presente, justificando as suas ações e garantindo que «o Partido tem sempre razão», que as suas previsões são sempre correctas. A opressão do Partido vai ao ponto de criar uma nova língua, uma que não possua os termos que permitem sequer conceptualizar pensamentos revoltosos.Enquanto passeia pelas decrépitas ruas da cidade de Londres, Winston repara na miséria em que vivem os «proles», mas também em como são os únicos que vivem em relativa liberdade, passando a ver na classe mais baixa da sociedade a única força que poderá um dia subverter o Partido. Nestas ruas está também gravada a «incompetência» do Partido para governar ou apenas o espelho da sua ganância; o esforço e meios gastos para controlar o povo através de avançada tecnologia, não é concordante com a pobreza que se vê.Com Winston - com as consequências das suas ações «rebeldes» - entramos numa inevitabilidade assustadora. Reeducado à força, através de intimidação psicológica e tortura física, Winston vê-se sem escape e sem esperança; morrer a odiá-los, apesar de submissão total, parece ser a única liberdade possível.Esta é uma sátira escrita em forma de aviso, expondo possibilidades terríveis, mas não completamente originais, sobre a submissão intelectual do povo, a omnipresença do governo que oprime e controla sem medida, difundindo a sua mensagem através de exaustivas campanhas. 1984 alerta-nos para o perigo dos terríveis -ismos (do comunismo, do fascismo, do nazismo, …, enfim, do totalitarismo), demonstra a relevância da linguagem como concretizador de pensamentos e chama a atenção para a importância de mantermos a nossa identidade, a nossa memória sobre o passado e conhecimento sobre a História. "
1161,Jarezal,"2+2=5.Si toda la información que pudieras consultar estuviera manipulada, ¿cómo podrías saber lo que sucede realmente en el mundo? ¿Cómo puedes ser libre si todo lo que lees, todo lo que ves, todo lo que escuchas ha pasado por el filtro oficial para que se adapte a la ideología del partido? ¿Cómo puedes pensar algo que sea diferente a lo que quieren que pienses?En 1984 se nos presenta una sociedad totalitaria donde el Gobierno controla absolutamente todos los aspectos de la vida cotidiana. En ella, los ciudadanos son sometidos a vigilancia permanente mediante unos aparatos instalados en las casas y si alguien manifiesta una opinión diferente a la establecida por el Gobierno es detenido. Si no estás conmigo, estás contra mí.Además, se mantiene un estado de guerra permanente contra “el enemigo”. Otra sociedad igualmente totalitaria, que no se diferencian en casi nada la una de la otra pero que se presenta a los ciudadanos como el mal y la causa de todos los problemas. Y si alguien cuestiona alguna de las políticas es indudablemente un simpatizante del enemigo. Porque el Partido nunca se equivoca y es la única solución posible a todos los males.El protagonista del libro, Winston Smith, es uno de los burócratas de esta sociedad. Trabajando para el Ministerio de la Verdad se dedica a manipular la historia. Su objetivo es alterar libros, periódicos, fotografías… que muestren algo que vaya en contra de los postulados del Gobierno. Si ahora estamos en guerra contra Eurasia, siempre hemos estado en guerra contra ellos por lo que todos los documentos donde aparecieran como aliados deben ser modificados.De esta forma, la verdad es lo que el Gobierno dice que es la verdad. El miedo, la represión y la impotencia provocan que no se cuestione la versión oficial y parece que nadie nota las contradicciones entre lo que se dice hoy y lo que se dijo ayer.Debido a su trabajo, Winston empieza a darse cuenta de todas las falsedades que le rodean y tras conocer a una joven con sus mismas inquietudes reúne el valor necesario para dejar a un lado el conformismo y resistirse al control del Gobierno.Durante la resistencia de Winston se nos van descubriendo las diversas técnicas que usa el Gobierno para asegurarse el control de la sociedad. La manipulación del lenguaje, la restricción de información, la escasez, el enemigo al que achacar todos los males, la vigilancia de la sociedad por la propia sociedad. Y si todo esto falla, tortura y lavado de cerebro. 1984 lleva el control al extremo pero nos hace reflexionar sobre nuestra propia sociedad y la facilidad con la que nos dejamos manipular. Las lealtades ciegas al partido político de turno, la confianza que ponemos en lo que nos cuentan los medios de comunicación y cómo muchas veces aceptamos que dos más dos son cinco porque es lo que nos dice el Gran Hermano. Y recuerda, Big Brother is watching you!"

1163,Erensu,"This book is one of the famous and intense distopian of all kind of books. George Orwell is quite successful to describe the community which dominated by fear and oppression. The mottos of this book - War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength- compel us to think about the world we are living now.The topic is profound and a bit scary at first but then you start to think that, these things are highly reflects our societies in terms of fear and oppression. From the book's date of issue 1942, it influenced people all around the world and aroused interests of all humans. I think every person who read this book would find something in the book plausable and interesting. "
1164,Maz,"1984 is the most geniality horrifying book! that after reading it you'll keep your mind wide open and be more conscious, and you'll never be able to see the world as it was before. Orwell's a genius! "
1165,Pino,"I was so anxious getting to the end of 1984. It's not a book that you want to be finished and get over with.Maybe it's dark and written in despair but it's lively and vivid.About politics, or better power, control and authority and its relationship with the 3 classes low, medium and high: how they see it, remember it, live it and endure it as a group and also individually. A system of deceit and treachery,a police state with no laws or rights. Where thinking is a dangerous crime and obedience is not enough. A permanent war and fear and suffering.A system we're all familiar with if it happens you lived under a dictatorship once or you are aware of what's going on around the globe.Main character Winston Smith who believes the Party meant to be destroyed and things will change again but doesn't know how and when.Julia who accepts the Party ruling as something unalterable ""like the sky' you can't rebel against , you just evade it sometimes. ""The best books, are those that tell you what you know exactly.""You may also need to carry on with ""Brave new world"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"" if you didn't yet :)"
1166,آلاء الأسيوطي,رواية عظيمة جدا لكن صادمة جدا انا كنت مصدومة طول الوقت وانا بقرأ دول عندهم شرطة الفكر 
1167,Amna," 1984, a novel in which George Orwell predicts a rather horrifying future. A future of terror, where people are put under constant surveillance, where they abolish you for being a criminal of thought by carrying radical beliefs, where they control the media and alter the truth. The further I got in the book, the more horrifying it became, the more I realized how familiar 'they' seem to be. I realized that Orwell's novel almost hit the bulls eye in it's prediction, for many are already living in this state of terror, and worse yet, some don't even realize it. This was a disturbing book. This was a book that kept me up all night after the night of finishing it. This, to me, was more a masterpiece of a warning than it is of a book. "
1168,Jecko,"C'mon. This book is a classy classic!'Big Brother' has become a living and breathing expression used by politicians and laymen alike. Orwell's ideas have helped to clarify political relations for a couple of decades now, a rare feat for a book under the umbrella of fantasy/sci-fi. If its influence were not enough to deserve this book at least a well thought out consideration, its actual literary quality is rather decent as well. Orwell's strength lies not in a well constructed imagination, but in the force of plot and the intention prescribed to certain symbols and characters. Even if you don't agree exactly with Orwell's way of attacking government's notorious self-empowerment you still have to appreciate the divine literary exactness on display in Orwell's writing. Orwell, though a social critic, is firstly a writer. His intelligence is put on display well in his classic story."
1169,Timothy,"The novel 1984 By George Orwell is one that shall be read by young readers for centuries to come. With its third person view of the main character, Mr. Winston Smith, the book shadows him and his thoughts as he works day by day for the totalitarian government, the Party. Winston throughout the book seems indifferent to the party’s absurd ideas and dares to go beyond the horribly stern rule of his government. The main idea of “The party” is to induce fear into the human individual so they themselves are so paranoid as to take a wrong step. Rewriting history to its own benefit the Party attempts to eliminate all “flaws in the pattern.” By showing how the Party rewrites the history of the world from wars to the invention of the helicopter, George Orwell aims to show the results of a totalitarian government and all the problems that shall rise because of it. With a very dark and dim setting this book shows you the horridness of the Party from its posters of “Big Brother” the Party’s leader who is always watching you to the public hangings of the prisoners of war. This novel shows you how a totalitarian government changes the entire lifestyle of the people who live by these rules for the worse inducing fear, brainwash, and taking away any sense of freedom.Winston Smith always felt as if he “had been cheated of something he had a right to.” Meaning the Party took away all his desire, leaving him alone and depressed. Even his own wife left him being more loyal to the Party than her spouse. His depression always seemed to get the best of him until Julia steps into his life. Julia, a rebel without a cause, captures Winston’s heart. With her passion to rebel and her attitude, this only adds to this lucrative woman. Claiming to have had multiple affairs with Party members, she is the anti-party figure that Winston loves. One major point brought to light in the novel was how fear conquers all. There are various ways they induced fear in to the people of Oceania. One of these are the Telescreens, they are large television screens that the Party uses to monitor all citizens throughout the city. These screens monitor your movements, conversations, and worst of all your thoughts. Nothing is safe from the Party’s eyes as they delve into your mind and soul. This drives you to insanity, as your own thoughts become your worst enemy. Other ways they are able to put fear into the people includes public hangings of prisoners of war, and posters of the Party’s leader “Big Brother”. He is the face of the party and Winston himself wondered if this unknown leader even exists throughout the whole book. All these ways of ruling symbolize the totalitarian ideas of the government in this book and George Orwell uses them to show how powerless you truly are.When George Orwell began writing “1984” in 1946 post World War II, many of the political leaders during this time period influenced his writings. The allies and axis in World War II can be compared to Eurasia, Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasian. These were the 3 superpowers that took part in a never ending battle to conquer one another. During World War II he wrote for BBC’S Eastern Service supervising broadcasts in India to counter Nazi Germany’s propaganda. There he began to see all the horrid propaganda surrounding the war and the way Nazi Germany attempted to brainwash the mind of the people of India, just as “The Party” attempted to brainwash its own people throughout the book. During this time another totalitarian power was coming to rise, the Soviet Union. Gaining a lot of power post World War II many feared the rise of this superpower. Following the basic guidelines of “elaborate guiding ideology, a single mass party led by a dictator, system of terror, monopoly on weapons and communication, and central direction and control of the economy through state planning.” This scared many as the Soviets power only continued to grow during the Cold War. Orwell disagreeing with this way of politics took these ideologies created by the Soviets in writing his novel. “2+2=5. If you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from yourself.” These few lines explain the great power of the Party and how it affected everyone around them. Their lies are your truth, and your lies are their knowledge. Nothing not even your thoughts are safe from the Party. Orwell does a great job in depicting this throughout the book. Incorporating many different themes, symbols and character traits you get a grasp on how this government is able to keep itself afloat from day to day, successfully creating the allusion that you have absolutely no power over yourself. As the famous words of the Party are “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.”"
1170,Annisha Bell,"George Orwell's 1984 provides a chilling reminder that Big Brother is always watching you by taking this notion to the extreme. This novel follows the free thinker, Winston, as he attempts to break away from the totalitarian government's influence in small, yet blasphemous ways. As we progress through the novel, the notion of what's real and what is a lie becomes blurred over and over again until we are starting to ""double think"" ourselves. As Winston is subjected to Big Brother's coercive operations, we are reminded that standing out is a quick way to commit suicide. In order to survive, Winston must remove the very essence of his individualism and become a dutiful citizen that praises Big Brother with every breath. That proves more difficult, however, as the conditions he lives in each day take their toll. This book has made me ponder just how malleable the human psyche truly is, where even the surest certainties can be reversed or obliterated, leaving nothing but a true lie in its place. Orwell takes you on a journey through this brave new world, not sparing you the gritty details of its terrible inter-workings. All the while, we are hoping for an escape...but Big Brother is always watching. "
1171,Nishit Asnani,"1984 is one of those books that leave a huge impact on the reader. This is the first book of this kind that I have read. Our protagonist, Winston Smith, acts as the eyes for the reader. He is a ""lunatic"" in Oceania, one of the three fictional powers of this story, the other two being Eurasia and Eastasia. The way that the totalitarian government has been portrayed is exciting as well as intimidating. As someone pointed out in his/her review, this could very well be classified as a horror story. :PThe division of the story into three parts is apt. Almost all the elements, including the romantic angle, the handbook of Goldstein, Smith's fondness towards a time long forgotten and the characterization of O'Brien, fit very well and add a lot of value to the story. I think everyone should read 1984 once to realize the extent of the freedom that he/she enjoys in the current state, so that they can better utilize it. "
1172,Assala Lamaa mallak,"A masterpiece!!! its sad how this 1984 of george orwell remembers me of our 2014 and gives me ideas about how the 2084 will look alike... Its sad if at the end ""they"" can always fix us to be ""happy"" again and re run with the system..."
1173,Daniel,"This book is quite frankly just awesome. There are so many quotable moments and characters it's unbelievable, and on top of that it has very elaborate yet intriguing plot. I simply could not predict it (except them getting caught doing their little thang in the end. Oh, uh, spoiler alert by the way...), but it wasn't so far fetched that I totally didn't get it at all. Everything was easy to understand. Orwell is a masterful architect when it comes to writing in a way that is clearly intellectually higher than most while at the same time retaining a readability that I think is pretty much unsurpassed. The only other person I could compare the style to might be Ernest Hemingway, with the 'simple-yet-complex' configuration, but at the same time throwing in some pretty gnarly words that catch you off guard. But Orwell's phraseology is more than that: it's a work of art. One can tell that he put extreme thought into every word and every phrase, and crafted each moment with such a simply virtuosity that he got across exactly what he wanted to get across. From characters that are the roundest of round and dynamic nature, a setting that bleeds with discomfort and exposed privacy, a plot that will keep you guessing without being overly complicated, and an ending that will haunt you till the end of your days, Orwell's magnum opus is exactly that. His masterpiece. This is the stuff legends are made of."
1174,Kornnarong Pakdeepan,คงไม่ต้องพูดอะไรมากกับหนังสือเล่มนี้ที่คนกำลังหากันทั่วบ้านทั่วเมือง อ่านในที่สาธารณะอาจมีสิทธิโดนจับด้วย cool มั่กๆ ฮ่าาาา!!!!!
1175,Jonathan Gillespie,"Most of my past book reviews have been carefully groomed, edited works, which I go back through and re-edit for clarity purposes. But 1984 is a book that inspires raw emotions in a doublepluspoignant way, so a carefully constructed treatise just doesn't seem appropriate.Reading this book, I learned two things: 1) George Orwell is one of the few people I've ever encountered who saw the world as I do, even if we don't agree completely on the solutions to its problems, and 2) he produced what might be the finest book in the English language.Mankind is a creature of very dual drivers. We want freedom, and justice, but we're chained by Maslow's hierarchy of needs; all things being equal, a well-fed, warm, and entertained human usually won't make many waves in the political structure within which they live (see also: the Roman Empire). 1984's Oceania is an empire built around convincing the populace that the brutal regime they live under has given the very best state of existence ever known, and it has done this by controlling its residents' perspectives on both the past and the future. In such a way, it lowers the peak at the top of that pyramid of needs, while consciously and savagely attacking the concepts of familial love.The optimist in me knows such a state might endure for hundreds, or even thousands of years, in the same way that North Korea exists in such a fashion but will, inevitably, one day be torn apart by its own people. The cynic in me, however, knows that mankind is always capable of being driven into such a system in the first place.What we face in our own American empire is a turn-key Oceania in the making. Our vast surveillance state is unapologetic, imagining that it has an inherent right to the personal information of not just its own citizens, but foreign nationals. Our military-industrial complex is so vast that it has become a dangerously-interconnected aspect of our economy; in which talking heads such as Andy Dean now openly implore the need for its presence as a bulwark against economic calamity (lost, it seems, are Eisenhower's own warnings on this very same dynamic). We chase shadows of shadows in foreign entanglements our founders implored us to avoid; we see a threat in every fracturing nation within the Middle East; we imagine one such nation as ""our greatest ally"" (though, tellingly, none can quite qualify why), and defend it with--among other things--an ""Iron Dome"" defense system that shoots $50,000 missiles at $100 homemade incoming rockets.Against this canvas of misdirected economic and security resources, we saw an election in 2012 built on ""saving the middle class"", featuring two candidates sponsored by a financial sector that no longer believes in reasonable reserve requirements, but took billions of dollars from the taxpayers when said investments folded. We watched elements of both parties co-opt the populist revolts against the status quo, with the Democratic Party claiming Occupy and the Republican Party harnessing the Tea Party (what's next, the recruitment of Anonymous?).We perform our own works on the social engineering front, as well. We have attacked the father and denigrated the homemaking mother. The concept of ""child"" is being eroded as we begin to train ourselves to think of the unborn as parasites, dress our children in increasingly more adult clothing, and widely regard raising our descendants as some sort of unending ordeal taking us away from our free time. We are abdicating the responsibility of the care of friends, fellow man and family to the state. We are more connected than ever, but spend our time together mired separately in smart phones and internet devices. Pontificators and their ilk train us to think that God and Science cannot coexist; that if Red or Blue will simply win the country will be saved; that sufficient intelligence no longer demands humility; that ""they hate us because we're free""; that the internet's fount of pornography is somehow a healthy alternative to true human intimacy. We are a society at war with our own civilization.Our culture's fundamental value these days seems to be distraction; we are anchored to Facebook and enslaved to the meme. We don't have the time for Orwell's warnings, especially because we're the United States, and are thus somehow invulnerable to the same internal forces and ambitions that devastated so many past empires.It is a time for doublethink, and we are all increasingly proficient at our Two Minutes Hate."
1176,Hadrian,One of the most frightening and prophetic novels ever written. What else is there to be said? Read it.
1177,Jaeda York,"I loved this book. This book had a variety of levels that you uncover every chapter. 1984 explored topics from communism, fascism, and government control. Orwell shows government control and how it affects the mind and body. The book's government is ruled by an authoritarian dictatorship. A man named Winston has to help fight against the Party ruled by Big Brother. He meets the love of his life throughout the battle until Big Brother gets control.... "
1178,Anagha,The original dystopian. One of my all-time favorites!
1179,Ruth Harlow,"What can one write about 1984 that has not yet been written? It was popular in 1984, the year I graduated from high school and started U0. I did not read it then - my honors English class chose Dicken's Hard Times instead. We were reacting against 1984's popularity and establishing our intellectual freedom from GroupThink (today it would written like a computer program with the G and T capitalized).It is eerily relevant to the current world. The constant low level war, the proles - referred to as pleebs in Altwood's trilogy. Trailer trash, white trash, red necks by the current vernacular. the war against terror. the war against drugs. the wars in Crimea and Syria and Afganistan. Cameras on the streets and the NRS' constant collection of data. Big data, metadata. We accept it in return for freedom. DoubleThink.And yet the personalization of the brainwashing in 1984 is hard to imagine. Is Winston Smith worth the effort? Would each and every member of hte outer party require that level of intervention to accomplish the goals of the party? The conversations between Winston and O'brian are essential to telling the story and yet they challenge the premise of the book. If the power took constant and individual vigilance would BB and the party be so powerful?This is a book one should read every few years. And also the Feminine Mystique. They are essential touchstones to humanity."
1180,Emily H,"1984 by George Orwell is your classic apocolytic utopian novel, however is respectfully credited with the futuristic ideals the novel revolves around, such as “Big brother”, betrayl of government, and population control through electronic media. Throughout the novel Winston is awaiting the revolution-he realizes that the people are being lied to. However, the revolution never happens because Winston trusted the wrong people. This leads to a letdown at the end of the story, but stays as a prevalent significant and powerful reminded that if we don’t govern ourselves first, someone else will."
1181,Zach,"1984 is a fiction novel by George Orwell which is (at the time of its publication) based in the future. The book may be seen as a political statement or strictly entertainment depending on the reader, but the subject matter touches on political oppression, sexual repression, fear, paranoia, censorship, and power.Orwell constructed a world in which there are only three political states in control: Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia. The state in focus is called Oceania, and it is an environment in which its citizens are under constant surveillance by the Party and its figurehead, Big Brother. To simplify the book and avoid giving too much away, the citizens of Oceania are controlled completely by the government. Their words and actions are constantly being watched via technology called telescreens. People can be arrested for literally anything that would be seen as an act of rebellion or even disproval of the Party. There are spies and police called the Thought Police specially trained to catch civilians in the act of Thoughtcrime (literally thinking anything negative towards the Party). Big Brother is set up to be a god, and Oceania has to view him as the perfect force in the world. Anything and everything viewed as positive in the world has come from Big Brother. The citizens are forced to believe and follow this society by being brainwashed through destruction of language to the point of elimination of thought, forced sexual repression except when needed for procreation, and the fear that at any moment a person can and will be taken away and literally annihilated from the face of the earth. On top of all these atrocities against humanity, there is a department of the government which literally rewrites history every day, changing any printed information regarding Big Brother and the Party in order to fit it to their agenda. The story follow a citizen of Oceania named Winston Smith. Winston knows that everything is wrong in the state, but obviously lives in fear knowing what could happen to him if he says or does anything that would lead people to discover his feelings. He believes that the Party will one day fall because the citizens would rise up and overthrow it. At the same time, Winston is struggling with history (his own as well as the world’s) and wanting to find some connection with the truth. He does this by interviewing people who had lived before the Party took control and visiting an antique shop to find items from the previous world. Winston believes that there is an underground Brotherhood set up to destroy the totalitarian rule of Big Brother, though he cannot know for certain if it exists. The plot gives Winston’s journey to discover if there is indeed an objective truth in the world and also his attempt claiming his own identity and place in history.The book was honestly one of the most engrossing pieces of literature I have ever read. It is divided into three parts and builds up with an intensity that finally left me speechless at the close. The plot has so much detail and is put together so cohesively that I couldn’t help but feel as though I was reading about a true historical event.Overall, I was left with an understanding of why 1984 is considered a classic. It is a book that had gripped me from start to finish and made me feel the situations that occurred. When there was a moment of paranoia, I felt paranoia. When there was a moment of horror, I felt horror. The only con that I felt was the idea that the future world was set in a date that wasn’t much farther in the future than Orwell was living, however, after finishing the book I completely lost that criticism because it’s really not that important in the grand scheme of things. I recommend this novel to anybody; it is truly one of the best that I have ever read."
1182,Hast,"The third part of the book was dreadful to read. Not because it was badly written, but because of the things it describes. By the end I wanted to hug humanity. It reminded me of the way the people that were ""reeducated"" in Romania said they didn't want a revenge. When reading other reviews I was surprised to see how many people think that in the end he was shoot. Although it is a very plausible ending to his life, in fact Winston was just dreaming with his eyes opened. One thing that caught my attention was ""doublethink"". Because I often see politicians acting this way. One day they will say one thing and the other day they will deny it. For example, in Romania we have more than two parties. Sometimes a politician collaborates with another party or a person, but after a while he says it never happened. Or what about American republicans? On the one hand they do not what gun control laws, because that would imply a breach of personal information by the state. Yet simultaneously they defend the NSA collecting all sorts of information. Don't they see the contradictions in the way they think about certain things? Or do they do it on purpose? "
1183,Amit Sharma,"The novel, 1984 itself might need to be reviewed several times, in order to write a review on it, such is the breath-taking imagination and complexity of the future created by George Orwell in his yet another marvellous piece.Carrying on from where he left in Animal Farm (a satire on Russian Revolution), he presents a cold and chilling vision of a dystopian society where surely enough nobody wants to live in. A disturbing picture of the future is portrayed euphemistically in gory details.The future presented speaks of a world of fear and treachery and torment which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself. It’s not based on love and justice but on forgery where history is continuously rewritten, by the government, Big Brother, which is in ultimate control. George Orwell uses a perfect combination of irony and euphemism to highlight day-to-day falsification of the past, which were carried out by the Ministry of Truth and the work of repression and espionage carried out by the Ministry of Love.People lived in such a hostile society that nobody dared to speak above a whisper as they were under surveillance 24X7. And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one subject to another like the flame of a blowlamp. Winston Smith was one such fellow who had the fire in his belly and goes against Big Brother by having his own thoughts and a love affair, both of which were inevitable to hide.Winston bears not only the physical torture of Big Brother’s law force but also the battle within his own head, whether to stand his ground or give in. Just like Animal Farm, this astounding novel clings to the memory of every reader. It even goes one step ahead and forces them to think rather ‘doublethink’ in order to understand ‘WHY’ rather than ‘HOW’ something is happening in their vicinity."

1185,Joy Dutta,"Today it might seem to be a common idea, the Big Brother Show going on throughout the world, whether you want to participate in it or not. You have televisions (or tele-screens which are two ways, i.e. can transmit information as well as receive information. You cannot escape it. ""Big Brother is watching you."" Things get different when you realize it is a 1949 novel.Politicians or the Inner Party leader are power hungry and to retain it are ready to push the world to extreme levels of ignorance, without a capability to think, without a mind to think, ""a shell of a man"". It draws idea from the Nazis and the Russian communists which propagated the idea of distrust amongst its subjects. The best way to control a group, a future possibility of a mutiny is to set everyone against each other. Children are encouraged to spy on their parents, neighbours on theirs, no family, people mate to ""fulfil"" their duty towards the Party.A very strong idea which evolves with a personal touch of Winston and spark of optimism with the entry of Julia, but then has a realistic ending, no one can stand against""Big Brother"" a colossal, to which powers (Eastasia and Eurasia) collide and break. You are bound to love out of fear the embodiment of the Party, Big Brother."

1188,Sioned Raybould,"I don't want to break this novel into chunks as I normally do as I feel it would ruin the experience. However, I will give a few of my views. Gorge Orwell perfectly depicted the (quite frankly) evils of a totalitarian government. The world, split into three vast states: Oceania, Eastaisa and Euraisa who are constantly at war. Through the technique of exploring his own views in Goldstein's novel, Orwell more or less points out that a world constantly in a state of war is actually in a state of peace. War has been redefined - designed by the parties of each state to convince its people that the other states are evil, against them. Thus, as a result the same strategies are often used, few actually die or are injured and being at war is the same as not being at war. Without war the states have marked borders, they control their people through harsh methods and with war it is exactly the same. In this war we would never see the massacres like in WW1 or WW2. Thus, war = peace.Onto freedom = slavery. Orwell has quite intelligently pointed out that we are all slaves to death, that we are all slaves to our own minds. Big Brother and the Party, however, are eternal. Thus, if the people live, breathe, think and worship Big Brother and the Party they become part of the mass mind of the party, they too are immortal.Ignorance = strength. I think that this goes without saying. If you read the novel this one is pretty straight forward. If you remain ignorant (perhaps like the Proles or several party members who have been brainwashed since birth) you will be part of the Party's mind - the strongest force at all. We see Winston - an intelligent individual who goes against the party - suffering, corrupted and humiliated. His mind is twisted from reality to fiction - he grows weak, ignorant. Therefore, ignorance is strength in this case.So yeah, whilst I derived a lot more from the book those were the three main points that I think are emphasised in this novel over and over again. This novel is not only a wonderful story but it is also a lesson to all of us. Whether we believe in socialism or individualism Democracy is always best.'We are the fortunate ones who never faced oppressions gone.' -Linkin park.Wonderful read. Everybody should read this. 5*"

1193,Pedro Santos,"2 + 2 + 5?O que passa pela sua mente quando se pensa em uma sociedade totalitária? Toque de recolher, julgamentos sem o devido processo legal, guerras? George Orwell imaginou, em 1948, um mundo sufocante onde governos tipo Hitler e Stalin seriam coisa de criança quando comparados ao poder do Grande Irmão, o Big Brother.Clássico do que especialistas chamam de literatura política, 1984 traz um mundo aterrador, dividido em três superestados que estão em guerra permanente. O objetivo da guerra não é vencer o inimigo, mas manter no poder certo grupo dominante. As pessoas não têm liberdade de ir e vir e, muito menos, de pensar. Em grande parte das residências, um objeto chamado teletela “vê” o que todo mundo faz. O Estado detém a memória: todos os registros do que aconteceu antes da chegada do Grande Irmão ao poder foram modificados e sofrem alterações assim que uma notícia, artigo ou opinião entrem em conflito com as necessidades do momento. Nada havia além do Partido: “tudo se fundia e confundia num mundo de sombras no qual, por fim, a data do ano se tornara incerta”.A coesão interna é obtida não apenas pela opressão, mas também pela elaboração de um novo idioma - a Novilíngua - que impediria que qualquer opinião contrária ao Partido fosse expressa. Trata-se de uma coleção de vocabulários enxutos que condensa ou remove sentidos a fim de restringir o pensamento. Uma vez que as pessoas não pudessem se referir a algo, isso passaria a não existir. A palavra mais usada no livro, seguindo o novo idioma, é duplipensar. Seu significado corresponde ao fato de o indivíduo conviver simultaneamente com duas crenças opostas, aceitando ambas. “Saber e não saber, ter consciência de completa veracidade ao exprimir mentiras cuidadosamente arquitetadas, defender simultaneamente duas opiniões opostas, sabendo-as contraditórias e ainda assim acreditando em ambas; usar a lógica contra a lógica, repudiar a moralidade em nome da moralidade, crer na impossibilidade da Democracia e que o Partido era o guardião da Democracia; esquecer tudo quanto fosse necessário esquecer, trazê-lo à memória prontamente no momento preciso, e depois torná-lo a esquecer; e acima de tudo, aplicar o próprio processo ao processo. Essa era a sutileza derradeira: induzir conscientemente a inconsciência, e então, tornar-se inconsciente do ato de hipnose que se acabava de realizar. Até para compreender a palavra ""duplipensar"" era necessário usar o duplipensar."" O livro conta a história de um funcionário do Partido, Winston Smith (referência ao primeiro-ministro inglês durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, Winston Churchill, junto a um sobrenome comum no Reino Unido: Smith) que passa da indiferença na sociedade em que está inserido à revolta. Para ele algo estava errado. Faltava alguma coisa. Não sabia o que sentia e tentava extravasar sua angústia escrevendo em um diário – sempre em um espaço fora do alcance da teletela. Se fosse pego, provavelmente se submeteria à Polícia do Pensamento, que “sumia” com as pessoas, apagando qualquer vestígio de que elas teriam um dia existido. Tornaria-se uma “impessoa”.Com narrador em terceira pessoa, Orwell nos guia pelo caminho que Winston percorre na rebelião contra o sistema. Chega de ser mais uma engrenagem, mais uma peça da máquina do Grande Irmão. Naquele contexto, as coisas eram como o Partido quisesse que fossem. Em um desabafo, o protagonista escreve em suas anotações: “A liberdade é a liberdade de dizer que dois e dois são quatro. Admitindo-se isto, tudo o mais decorre”.O Grande Irmão pode controlar aquilo que temos de mais íntimo e particular: o pensamento. Para o autor, é o futuro. Um pesadelo. A metáfora do mundo que estávamos, em meados do século XX, quando o livro foi escrito: invasão de privacidade, avanços tecnológicos a favor do controle aos cidadãos, a manipulação da memória histórica, as guerras contínuas cujo objetivo não é conquistar territórios, mas manter intacta a estrutura da sociedade. Será que o planeta em que estamos vivendo vai se tornar um 1984? Ou já vivemos sob o olhar do Grande Irmão e ainda não nos demos conta?"

1195,Procyon Lotor,"Nuovo esperimento e nuove notizie. Preso in causa dal format televisivo, non ero certo di ricordare. A forza di sentirne e leggerne d�ogni per�, senza accorgermene ho accumulato cataste di riferimenti, cornucopie antologiche e pile babeliche di allusioni. Quando ha superato l�intensit� di unghie sulla lavagna miste a polistirolo sfregato, non ce l�ho fatta pi� e me lo sono dovuto rileggere. Non � datato, se possibile si � rafforzato dopo la scadenza fatidica. Rilascia un deposito d�orrore e disperazione che non � facile sopportare. 1984 � prima linea. Una societ� totalitaria. Senza un altrove. Tre regimi continentali, sempre in lotta, diversi solo per la forma. Se negli esempi reali sono rimaste sacche di indipendenza tollerata, qui � controllata pure la propria stanza. Orwell stesso specific� che era un romanzo antitotalitario tout court, mostr� � con la sistematica riscrittura del passato per la quale � istituito un apposito ente - che una nazione non doveva in alcun modo sentirsi al sicuro per la propria eredit� storica, modificabile. Scrive che il Socing stesso, il movimento politico totalitario di 1984, intende essere superamento dei totalitarismi passati. Si sviluppa in tre parti. Winston Smith, protagonista, riferendosi al suo lavoro, riscrivere sistematicamente la storia, evoca partecipando alla vita - rigorosa successione di momenti coatti - la situazione dell�Inghilterra nel momento. Non un singolo aspetto � lasciato al libero arbitrio. Prima di essere increduli, leggete e vedrete con quanta maestria Orwell diede vita a un orrore plausibile. Tutti gli aspetti pi� abituali di una vita decente sono controllati, ridotti al minimo o proibiti. Gli istinti pi� ovvi incasellati. E� degno di nota che perfino il cibo � reso volutamente scarso e di qualit� mediocre o pessima. E chi giudica non � un gourmet ma un inglese medio. Il sesso � scoraggiato � tranne che per le classi infime � dove la trasgressione � incentivata ma sempre nelle forme pi� degradate. Pure la musica e le canzoni sono ridotte a meccaniche ripetizioni di marce o di testi appositamente confezionati con macchine combinatorie. Il riposo, l�ozio creatore e gli incontri sono scoraggiati o proibiti. Nel mentre incontra Julia. I suoi pregiudizi, la sua situazione squallida e la generale proibizione di incontri affettivi fanno si che Winston la tema e pensi che lei sia una spia, come gi� i bambini erano allevati ad esserlo. Winston mostra pian piano un�insofferenza strisciante e una ancora incerta consapevolezza dell�inferno in cui vive. Winston si fa schifo. Poi Julia, a pagina 133, quando oramai siamo entrati totalmente nel mondo di 1984, con terrore iniziale di lui, fa avere a Winston un densissimo messaggio, il pi� eversivo rivoluzionario e sedizioso che in quella societ� si possa concepire e scrivere: due parole antiche, �ti amo�. La seconda parte � la loro storia d�amore, plausibile, seria, consequenziale e condivisibile. Quasi mai ricordata da chi cita 1984 se non con una nota di sciatta rapidit�. Invece, per quale motivo noi dovremmo odiare quella societ�? In base ad astratte nozioni di Libert�, �galit�, Fraternit�? Ci sono molte altre vittime del potere ma col quid pro quo. Julia e Winston non ci guadagnano nulla: si amano quindi si oppongono. Se loro non possono amarsi � una societ� di merda e decidono di combatterla. L�intero romanzo si regge, in realt�, su questo. Se il lettore trova la storia d�amore un po� misera si mandi affanculo. Non me lo dica o glielo mando io, pi� volte e gratis, se me lo dice in faccia lo picchio con la catena dell�antifurto. La terza parte � l�orrore. Scoperti vengono torturati fino ad abiurare se stessi e l�altro. Molti fessacchioni di scarsa memoria o lettura millantata, riportano che lui la tradisce. Errore. Ognuno dei due lo fa. Molti altri ricordano che non si incontrano pi�. Si incontrano invece e il reciproco tradimento li ha annichiliti fino a non pi� piacersi. Pochi notano che in realt� non si tradiscono. Che uno parli ed abbia forma umana, non dimostra che sia ancora un uomo o una donna. Quando si tradiscono non lo sono pi� da tempo. Pur di non sopportare orrori senza fine non gli viene concessa nemmeno una fine orrenda. Il Grande Fratello � in realt� una proiezione simbolica e un utile artifizio retorico. Il romanzo si reggerebbe anche senza. I fessacchioni lo citano come se ne fosse l'ossatura. Contrariamente a quanto sostengono infine ulteriori fessacchioni, il romanzo non termina con la morte fisica di Winston che rischia permanentemente ma la scena non c'�. La struttura della Neolingua � in appendice. Il regime utilizzer� come strumento principe di ideologizzazione una lingua priva dei concetti scomodi e delle strutture del pensiero libero. Un�assoluta novit� di Orwell, strutturata benissimo e che d� definitiva patente di originalit� al romanzo. Dei maggiori che ne parlarono ricordo fu citata estensivamente solo da U. Eco, non a caso. Eco per� � col suo spirito kelvinato - del�amore non parla, anche questo non a caso. Grande scrittore ma calore umano da da faccia oscura della luna, da idrogeno liquido, da spazi intergalattici.

1196,Namrata Jain,"I love the way he writes. He never assumes much about his reader and at the same time trusts them entirely to understand what he writes.Either ways, the book was a great read, whether you take it as fiction or a political satire. There are so many things about this book that will probably haunt me for the longest time. ""You are the dead"", Winston's turn at Room 101, the truth is what is collectively believed and not what you believe, despite of being right.. and O'Brian's(and the inner party members') utter, complete and failproof belief in his lunatic view of the world. Not sure if pure power can really sustain itself that long, but the rat race of making more and more money has made current times come to a similarity that's striking and hence, really scary. As a side note, it's interesting to realize how, despite of belonging to the same race, man has the power to inflict extreme pain and torture on it's own kind and at the same time also has the power to endure it."
1197,Justin Simpson,"Another classic I refused to read until way later than I should have. 1984 has every aspect required to become an all time favorite on my shelf that also includes Burgess' 'A Clockwork Orange'. Orwell's style of writing is beautiful, one of the few books I've read where I often paused to write down sentences and phrases I particularly enjoyed, such as ""It was not the man's brain that was speaking; it was his larynx. The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but it was not speech in the true sense: it was noise uttered in unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck."" While I was vaguely familiar with the story that is told in 1984, I was not ready for how utterly dark it is. The characters, their environment, and the overall atmosphere of Oceana and her inhabitants are described in great detail, painting a picture of despair that provides the reader a window for macabre voyeurism. My only con on this book - which isn't a con for me, at all, actually - is that the conspiracies mentioned throughout are all too real in our lives and in our society, often leaving the reader trying to apply the philosophies and ideas to their own lives. If you're a conspiracy nut, you have other issues to deal with, but for me, it was a great way to further understand and appreciate the thoughts of Mr. Winston Smith in his struggle. Every one of us is just like Winston. The question is, are we Winston in part I, or Winston in part III? "

1199,Yau Ming,"I first read this book in the late eighties. It is definitely worth a re-read!Counterintuitively, depending on one's own perspectives, this book is as relevant as ever, with the era of big data in the cloud and social networks. Big Brother (in all but name) is indeed watching us.There is also discussion on the empirical method of analysis which has been the basis for advancement for modern society, and its erosion by the Party. In recent times, the advent of spin over scientific analysis has manifested itself in movements such as creationism and climate change denial."
1200,Tristan May,"	1984 is a book set in a police state London where the rights of the people are nonexistent. ""War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength"" is the Party's motto which defines the very nature of the new government. The country is always in a constant state of war with the other two powers, Eurasia, and Eastasia. It's become illegal to even think, thought crime, as they call it. And all information is under government control. Patriotic stories are made up and history is constantly rewritten. A man named Winston, is one of those people who write these. Winston has a hatred of the party but always ends up falling back in line and conforming like everyone else. He has some fuzzy memories of what life was like before the party as a child. Something about nuclear warfare and the American take over of the British Empire. This is a dark world and a warning to what might happen if we allow it to. What I really like about this book is how it creates a whole world of a completely totalitarian government. It shows how the control of information, removing freethinking people, and how the endless propaganda keeps everyone in line. The people are trained to report on any suspicious activities. Even their own children can't be trusted as they are indoctrinated to loyally serve the party to the bitter end. It reminds me of how the nazis would put children into the Hitler Youth and were trained to uphold the principles of the nazis. That's another thing that I like about this book. Some of this stuff has already happened. From the Nazis to the Soviet Union this world has always existed. And as technology advances the easier it is to happen. I think it shows how just giving up your freedom for some protection leads to a dark world of oppression. We should heed George Orwell's message and ""don't let it happen""."
1201,Kathy,"Very interesting concept. Makes me wonder where society is headed. It is true that there are certain things that lead me to believe our government is trying to impose similar tactics. The Bush administration is always trying to cover up one thing or another. They want to be able to tap into people's phone lines if they ""sound suspicious"". It made me feel sad at the end, because I felt like there is no hope- that society as we know it is doomed. It made me sad that he wasn't able to maintain a little bit of reality and that he allowed himself to ""turn to the dark side"". I wasn't too disappointed that he betrayed Julia, but mostly because during the whole book I wished that he could find someone a little better. By that, I mean that she didn't really care about the whole spectrum of things, only what directly affected her life. I was a little sad when they met again. I wanted it to spark some feelings. I thought the whole concept of Newspeak was intriguing. It is true that with narrower language abilities, thought could be hindered. I had really hoped that he would join an underground society and it really threw me off that it didn't really exist. After reading the whole thing I can see how it would be almost impossible for a society like that to exist, what with the telescreens everywhere. Winston was right that the hope was with the proles. They were given a lot more freedom. The only chance of a revolution would be for a few intelligent proles to get together and form a secret society among themselves. After all the changes being implemented among the Party, the proles would end up more intelligent. They would actually be able to think and have their own ideas/opinions. Overall, I really enjoyed the book even though it made me sad. The U of U play was also good. They rearranged a little of the order anda dded the weird people in the cell with him. It was well acted and it was cool that they had the lady get naked."
1202,melydia,"I've wanted to read this for a long time, but was never forced to in school and just didn't get around to it until now. It's an important book. Not only does it detail the dangers of totalitarianism, but also raises some really good questions about the nature of the past. Basically, if something happened in the past, and then all documentation was changed so that it appears to have not happened, and then everybody says it never happened, how can you be so sure you really remember it at all?A brilliant book, if a bit slow in places. It's driven much more by description of the dystopian land of Oceania than by character or plot. If you're interested in the inner workings of the socio-political landscape, you'll enjoy it. If you just want a fun little sci-fi romp, this probably isn't for you.All the same, I think it's a book people should read. The world of 1984 may seem overdramatic, but it is one plausible outcome of the gradual sacrifice of privacy and property in favor of governmental protection or the nebulous ""common good."" It's something worth thinking about. Indeed, that is perhaps this book's strongest point: it left me with an unusually large number of things to think about. That, my friends, is truly high praise for a novel.[Note: Star Trek: The Next Generation totally ripped off this book in the episode ""Chain of Command"" with the five/four lights thing. But Picard was a whole lot more badass under pressure than Winston, so they get points for that.]"
1203,Saerom Kim,"Actually, I think I already read this on high school,but Everything was so different when I went through this all over again. The big brother watching over you is kind of cliché in this time for us, especially of us in Korea.While I was reading this with the book by popper, I wonder if Orwell started to build up the society of Oceania, by the exact situation which popper described as what Plato dreamed of(I am not sure if Plato's perfect state in Republic is really in this way or not cause I've never tried to read Plato). But maybe we could fetch more then that in the story. Totalitarian country controlling everything including the language and the inner thoughts of people is of course depicted in dreadful way, but I want to think and focus in the conflicting epistemology; which is, Winston smith's journey starts from where he tries to think, and write things down, which itself will not mean anything in reality, but the thinking, which he can logically find something out which is not conceived as real; that he can logically reach for rational facts; these are based on rationalism.

1204,GeorgeD,"Αντί κριτικής: σήμερα το απόγευμα στην Πατησίων κάποιοι μεσήλικοι (περίπου 50-60 ετών) πετούσαν φέιγ βολάν στον δρόμο. Ασχέτως του τι πιστεύω πολιτικά και πώς κρίνω τον κάθε αγώνα, τους ρώτησα τι καταφέρνουν πετώντας φέιγ βολάν στον δρόμο εν έτει 2016 εκτός του να βρωμίζουν το περιβάλλον. Υπονοούσα φυσικά ότι υπάρχουν τόσοι τρόποι να ενημερωθούμε (εμείς που δυνητικά ΘΕΛΟΥΜΕ να ενημερωθούμε) ώστε η εκτύπωση χαρτιών να μην προσφέρει τίποτα εντέλει. Αντί απάντησης, έπιασαν μια μεγάλη χούφτα ο καθένας (μεγαλύτερη από αυτές που πετούσαν πριν τους μιλήσω) και τις πέταξαν μπροστά μου. Ας έρθει κάποιος να με πείσει ότι αυτοί είναι σκεπτόμενοι άνθρωποι που πρέπει να τους υπολογίζουμε. Κατά τη γνώμη μου, αυτόν τον τύπο ανθρώπου σχολιάζει στο μεγαλειώδες αυτό βιβλίο που περιγράφει το παρόν μας, ο Orwell. Και αυτός ο τύπος ανθρώπου είναι το ζυμάρι στα χέρια των φασιστών. Η ευκολία με την οποία πετούν φέιγ βολάν με συνθήματα χωρίς να νιώθουν την ανάγκη να δουν πέρα από τη μύτη τους είναι ανατριχιαστική.

In other words, there are many details occurring similarly nowadays in many countries. Hopefully these countries would have a different end than the one the novel has.5 stars for George Orwell's fabulous narrating style :)"

1208,Sydney Antonoff-Wertheimer,"This story follows a man named Winston Smith, an ordinary member of the Party, the political group that is in power in the year 1984. The members of the Party are not allowed to deviate in any way from the Party's propaganda, even when they know it is a lie. Their very thoughts are policed to ensure the Party will remain in power. On the outside, Winston appears to be happy with the Party, but on the inside, he is most certainly not. However, because of the strict (and unspoken) rules, Winston can't rebel against the Party without being immediately killed. 1984 tells the story of Winston's growing anger at the Party, and how he expresses his discontent.The character development in this book was very strong. Winston goes from being just another mindless Party member to enduring physical and psychological torture in order to keep thinking freely. I found that the plot was not the most important part of the book. It was fairly basic. Most of the conflict occurred within Winston's own mind. The language was very good - not very surprising, seeing as the book was written in 1948, when educated people actually knew how to write well.I gave this book five stars. I thought the subject was incredibly interesting, especially when paralleled to society today. Having read quite a few classics, I usually expect them to be slow, and at times, boring, but 1984 really pulled me in. I recommend this book to everyone, specifically high-schoolers."
1209,Theo Aldrin,"	1984 is a novel by George Orwell. The novel is set in the year of 1984 in London where the Party watches everyone who lives there. The leader of the Party is only known as Big Brother. His face is everywhere on posters throughout the city. There are telescreens that monitor every move each person makes. The Party created a new language to try to prevent political rebellions. Not only is doing rebellious things a crime, just thinking about it is considered a very great crime. The Party prohibits free thought, sex and anything that represents you as an independent individual. The Party observes everyone, they alter history and create lies about what happened in the past. They even create fake people to win lotteries and to take the blame for things.	The main character is Winston Smith. He is a 39 year old man who lives in London. He is constantly monitored and watched every where he goes. Throughout the novel his hate for the Party increases. Winston illegally bought a diary where he would express his hatred towards the Party and write down his criminal thoughts. He meets O’Brian, who Winston believes is a member of the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood is a group that is believed to work to overthrow the Party and its members. Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where his job is to change history so it relates to what the Party say has happened. One day he sees a coworker stare at him. She is a beautiful dark-haired girl who he immediately believes is an informant for the Thought Police. 	Winston starts to question what the Party said about Oceania and Eastasia had been allied in the war against Eurasia. Winston believes that he could think of a time when they weren’t allies. He also starts questioning if Emmanual Goldstein is actually a real person. The Party said that Emmanual Goldstein is the Brotherhoods leader who is the most dangerous man alive.	One day he met the dark-haired girl again. She slipped a note into his hand which said “I love you”. They arrange a meeting and she tells him that her name is Julia. They begin to have a secret relationship. They meet up in hiding places far away from the city to keep away from the Party who spies on everyone. Eventually they rent an apartment in the store where Winston bought his diary. He believes that they will get caught sooner or later so he decides to just go for it. Julia is a lot more optimistic. She doesn’t think that they will get caught. While Winston is with Julia his hatred for the Party increases more and more. 	I believe that Orwell’s message is that the totalitarian government of such as the Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union is bad. He was afraid that the governments were going to take away people’s freedom and human rights. He wrote the book as a warning to try to show what might happen if the governments move to totalitarianism. 	In my opinion, this book is a great book that you can relate to for some countries. It takes a look at how the world might’ve become if the Nazi’s won World War II. The plot twists are great and I found myself not being able to stop reading. I would highly recommend this book to everyone. It has a bit of everything in it."
1210,Khaled,"“Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.” With this simple argument, Orwell centralizes his book. It is a book that warns humanity of an impending menace that mankind is hovering into. It is an extraordinary script that will grip you from the first few pages till its last page. This negative Utopia book alters many of the well known standpoints of civilization and the progress of humanity on earth. It is worth to mention that Orwell argues about dehumanization of man which will represent the big threat to our existence on earth. Orwell's warning view of the future world is not meant to take a pessimistic reaction, but to warn humanity that there might still have time to save the humanity from impending in calamities of dehumanization of man. 1984"

""Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been re-written, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right. I know, of course, that the past is falsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it, even when I did the falsification myself. After the thing is done, no evidence ever remains. The only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don't know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories.""
If I am to describe this book with one word only, it would be ""magnificent"". It can easily get under your skin and send shivers down your spine. The whole atmosphere of the world of 1984 is bone-chilling, it claws its way in your mind and invades all the corners of your thoughts. It stays constantly with you and that is not because it is breathtaking, but because it feels disturbingly real, as if we're already at the doorstep of making Oceania a reality but still wondering whether to enter or turn tail and run in the opposite direction.I admit I haven't read many books, however, up to this point I have never ever stopped reading just to look through the window to think: ""wow, that's amazing"". So that should speak enough by itself. It seems like this is the first book that has made me think about every single topic it touches. This is not your usual dystopian story, because there is no way out of this world. No matter how much you try to struggle, no matter how much you hate, how much you despise the government, there is no way out - even the supposedly existing revolutionaries do not exist. Or they do - in name only - their purpose being flushing out otherwise thinking individuals. The Thought Police and the torture inside MiniLuv do not create martyrs; they reshape the way a person thinks and even feels for himself; they destroy the person you are and rebuild you as a lifeless machine-like creature. They build people who do not live, but simply exist for the Party, for Ingsoc, for Big Brother.While reading I was definitely intrigued, but also baffled, disgusted, terrified. And I agree that everyone should read this book. Everyone.
WAR IS PEACE.FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.

1216,Rachel Sullivan,"1984 is a perfect representation of the 1950s anti-communist mindset. Orwell's description of Big Brother and the history-canceling, humanity-stifling world of Oceania mirrors Soviet Russia. With the possibility of a world like Orwell's Oceania looming, it is easy to see why citizens in the 50s - 80s worked so diligently to stamp out communism around the world. Even today, the Iron Curtain torn down over 20 years ago, 1984 draws the eye to North Korea and other such countries where the lives of ordinary people are still censored and hidden from public view. Though Huxley's Brave New World is undoubtedly more relevant to present-day America, 1984 is still both a valuable historical reference and a fantastic piece of dystopian literature. It is both startling and heartbreaking, almost too real for the human mind to comprehend. Its perfect portrait of humanity in a world gone mad calls up certain unanswerable questions: What if Oceania were a reality? Would any of us be able to break through the all-encompassing watchful eye of Big Brother? "

1218,Rebeca Pereira,"George Orwell's 1984 is an adult dystopian novel about the life of Winston Smith, a government official, who lives in a society controlled by Big Brother, a power Winston, who has been submissive to for most of his life along with a brain-washed society (example: 2+2=5), grows to hate.Review:I've never read a book like 1984. Now a days there a so many dystopian novels that are almost exactly the same: the main character is a rebel that joins a group to fight the norm, has an unconventional love story, suffers a loss that changes who they are and goes on to defeat the powers at be. That is Tris's divergent nature, Katniss's and Peeta's love etc. Not that these aren't good books, in fact, because they create a world so drastically different from ours, these books are able to give their readers a wonderful, imaginative experience. But 1984 is different. The characters are complex, dangerous and beautiful.The love is deep and forbidden.Spoiler: The ending is not a happily ever after ending. It is sincere. It is realistic. It is raw and until the very last moment, I was on the edge of my seat.George Orwell creates such an unimaginably complex and scary society. The concept of Big Brother is what scared me in the beginning but what he taught scared me even more. What stuck with me throughout the whole book and still fascinates me when I think about how people could actually believe it is that ""War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is Strength.""Overall, I LOVED this book and I would recommend it to everyone. Not just those who like dystopian novels or fiction but everyone because it truly is a great experience. "
1219,Julie Rylie,"This is one of the best books I've ever read and it is quite disturbing I must say. This is those kind of books that will steal something from you or they will add something on you, so per say. I even fell it’s quite hard to express what you get from it, but it’s like one of those many awakenings you get from time to time. Orwell could create such a viable society based on the extreme of fear and hate with even a new simplified language that wouldn’t drive you to think too much, and that was the main goal of this new society leaders, create a mass of non thinking persons, because they could even catch your thoughts and they would spy every single damn movement you made.This is our society taken to an extreme, this is the result of people´s apathy...Trying to explain this again, disturbs me one more time, all I can say it’s that is very understandable why this is a classic of literature and that once you start reading this it’s viral, you cannot really stop and you crave for more. I’m definitely gonna read more Orwell soon. "

1221,Mary,"I really enjoyed 1984. As someone who advocates for freedom, I feel that this book is extremely relevant. Although our government is not exactly like the one portrayed in 1984, there are some disturbing resemblances. The most obvious example would be the documents released by Edward Snowden. Whether it’s through a telescreen, a cell phone, or the Internet, technology plays a major role in how the government violates our privacy. Even the language of Newspeak resembles abbreviations used in texting. The Party’s slogan, “war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength” (page 7) and the idea of doublethink resemble the mindset of some people. People speak of war being used to end violence, but it almost always is an act of aggression in which no side is blameless. “Freedom is slavery” makes me think of people who argue that liberty causes inequity, as if equality requires a superior government to rule over people. The prevalence of the belief that “ignorance is strength” can be proven through a law of syllogism: if ignorance is bliss and bliss makes one appear emotionally strong in a perilous world, then ignorance must be strength. I have been told many times to ""accept the things [I] cannot change,"" but I don't want to accept that I or others are being oppressed. I'd rather change the things I cannot accept.It is also said in the book that “freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four (page 69).” This is another way that 1984 relates to our current time. The government lies, and if someone tells the truth, they are called a traitor (Edward Snowden, anyone?). Unquestioning obedience to authority seems to be of higher importance than doing what is right, and that worries me. If you are one of those corrupt leaders, remember those wise words you may have seen on the Internet: ""1984 was meant to be a warning, not an instruction manual.""My only complaints about this book are bases purely on emotions and personal preference. But it's definitely worth reading! That is, unless you think it's an instruction manual, in which case, stay as far away from it as you possibly can and stop trying to take away our rights!"

1223,Sully,"1984 is a favorite of mine. I read it at a young age, having plucked it out of my older brother's bookcase without any idea what it was about. I remember that it chilled me to the bone. I'd read mostly kids books to that point, and 1984 was the first ""grown up"" book that I read. I wasn't at all prepared for where it went. I've since re-read it several times and still find it disturbing.A few years ago I had a discussion with a number of people when the topic of forcing students to wear RFID tags came up. A school district was proposing it as a way of keeping attendance and monitoring the kids, requiring the children to wear the tags hanging from straps around their necks, so that they could track them throughout the school using radio frequency readers. I was appalled at the idea, but even more shocked that most of the people discussing it seemed quite unconcerned about tagging kids like livestock.The conversation eventually widened to include such things as national id cards and surveillance cameras mounted in public places, as is apparently common in parts of England. What concerned me more than the schemes in question was the attitude of many of the people participating in the discussion, which could perhaps be summed up as: since I'm not planning to commit a crime, I don't really care if government watches me all the time, reads my email or can search my home without a warrant, etc.The logical extension of such thinking is only criminals need rights because government by its nature is somehow altruistic, and an innocent person need fear nothing from surrendering his rights. I'm not sure that anyone with such a naive belief - - or with such a fundamental lack of historical knowledge as to the behavior of governments in the past - - would truly appreciate Orwell's cautionary tale. They'd probably point out that it was written to warn about the dangers of Socialism or Communism, but nowhere is it written that leftist governments have a monopoly on tyranny. With few exceptions, those in power will be tempted to increase their own power given the opportunity. Therefore, we should guard our rights jealously and view any attempt to encroach upon them with the deepest suspicion.I'm sorry if this isn't a proper review of the book, but that's what I learned from it."
1224,Meg,"We read this for my Contemporary British Literature class and I was just blown away. Dystopian novels are apparently a trend in YA recently, but this has set a high standard and it's amazing.Orwell has a really futuristic vision and I am amazed that he was able to produce a work like this in his time. The story is just realistically horrifying to me.One of the things that interested me the most is the ""Newspeak"" that Orwell has created for this world. I studied linguistics, so generally, I learned that languages always obtain new words, thus widening its vocabulary. But in 1984, it is the reverse. How powerful and imposing a body of authority must be to be able to implement that kind of unnatural phenomenon?I definitely recommend this to anyone, especially those who are into dystopian novels. I hope they enjoy this as much as I did."
1225,Conor,When I first read this book as a fourteen-year-old I was most struck by the terms ‘Doublethink’ and ‘Doublespeak.’ Orwell had articulated my teenage observation that adults would often say things they knew were disingenuous or untrue so as not to “lift the painted veil.” It is a sociological phenomenon that many humans will not voice – or even think – the contradictions and absurdities of everyday life for fear that they would disturb their carefully constructed existence. It was validating for me as a young man to have my observations about human interactions confirmed by an author who died a half-century before. I also had a vague understanding that the book was a repudiation of totalitarianism.Re-reading the book as an adult with a through understand of political systems I am reminded of how incredibly prophetic Orwell was. He saw with utter clarity the dangers inherent in political movements. Animal Farm skewered the Communist Revolution and 1984 displays an advanced totalitarian system resulting from a Communist or Fascist revolution.So much has been said about this book already that it is unlikely I can offer anything new. Orwell was both a political and sociological genius and his dire warnings about dehumanizing political systems are as relevant today as they were in 1948. I am grateful that he gave us metaphors with which we can expose government dysfunction and overreach.I will mention that this actually a rather poor novel – rather it is a magnificent political essay with a narrative thrown in.

1228,Maddie Cramer,"I read a lot of horror books and often think of myself as desensitized, but this book is by far the most terrifying thing I've ever read. At the start of the book, Oceania seemed like a horrifying world that I would never wish to be a part of, but by the last few words, it was more than that. It was a nightmare I never wished to have seen. It astounded me in every word of section three that this book was written in 1949. All of that being said, I am so glad that I read it, and am sure that it will stay with me for the rest of my life. I want to give this book to everyone I know and yet also shield everyone from it. There are so many thought-provoking lines that I would have adored it even if the plot had not been utterly horrifying. This was the most beautiful nightmare I have ever had the opportunity to read. I would even venture to say that I ""loved"" every word."
1229,(Angel Anas) Anas Shahrour,"Interesting book.... the story happens in a dark world, so dark it makes stories of alien invasion, demons taking over the world, and Armageddon like nice fairy tales... and yet, not very far-fetched. You could almost believe it will happen.Don't think it is something you read before sleep or in the bus.... it is loaded with political, economic, and philosophic ideas... plus a lot of new vocabularies since it's a bit old. So it needs a lot of focus."
1230,Jackie Gordon,"The classic book is a dystopian novel, a book where the main character is wanting to break away from the oppressive government which spies on all citizens. The main character Winston Smith is watchful person at first wanting to join a rebellion group known as the brotherhood. He becomes more and more reckless whenever he meets Julia, a person who he dearly loves. Unfortunately, the political party in place known as the party, forbids showing an improper emotion displayed on the face (known as facecrime), thoughtcrime, and constantly is watching its citizens through a telescreen. The party controls the past with people having jobs to edit all previous documents that provide evidence of the party's lies. Winston Smith and Julia are caught by the thought-police for conspiring against the party (trying to join the brotherhood). They are tortured and brainwashed into mindless drones that now love the party and all beliefs it stands for. This is an incredible dystopian novel, perfect for those who like dystopian themed books."
1231,Stuller,"Eric Arthur Blair (who used the pseudonym George Orwell) was a very influential writer in my opinion. I've read this book at a young age with another masterpiece of him which was the 'Animal Farm'.Both of them were published in the '40s, the 'Animal Farm' in 1944 and the '1984' in 1948.It seems that nowadays his writings are getting more and more actual. Sadly..He wrote the latter one in an extremely difficult situation. He was suffering from severe tuberculosis, and just had to face a new threat which was completely unacceptable for him. The Soviet Union.The new standard (at that time) for a totalitarian dictatorship.SO he wrote his novel in a very depressing period of his life.First of all let's state the genre of the book. I would not call it a science fiction because it does not really meet the requirements of the above-mentioned genre. Although it has some future tech related inventions such as the 'TeleScreen' or the 'Thought Police', I would rather call it a dystopian political novel.The whole story takes place in London, in an imagined and terrible era where people have no rights, thoughts, no freedom of speech. You can't even say you love somebody except if you mean 'The Party'.'The Party' controls everything. Literally. You have to attend their special meetings, show respect and willingness to their orders. Our protagonist Winston Smith is one of the many who works at the 'Ministry of Truth'. He is in charge for correcting newspaper articles, leaflets, book excerpts which contain information from the past. He has to rewrite these information according to the new doctrines, planned numbers which published by 'The Party'.He is just a small ant in the hill and in the beginning we can see that he is just like the others. Clapping, shouting like them at the public gatherings, smoking and drinking the same awful quality products, living in a weathered and dirty block of flats.We can see the happenings around him through his eyes which makes the whole story even more depressing and tensious, but on the other hand much better.As the story goes on we can see him slowly realising that something is really wrong deep inside the system and has to be changed.He starts meeting with a girl from another department. Her name is Julia and she is a rebel just like Winston. Soon their relationship starts to bond even stronger, although it is not really based on mutual love, but rather hatred towards the whole rotting totalitarian system.When they are captured by the 'Thought Police' we want to stand against the system's will just like our heroes.Their torture begins with the lead of O'Brien. He is the one who embodies the system. He shows no mercy at all, he enjoys the whole terrible procedure.At one time he orders his 'minions' to take out Winston's teeth, tortures his body, treats him like an animal not a human being.But soon we have to realise that it is impossible. Our volition is going to fall apar, our thoughts are manipulated and tortured just like theirs.We have to face the saddening truth that one or two people don't stand a chance against the gears of such an enormous machine like the whole built system.As a final chord we are forced to see that even their love is crushed like an old branch. When Winston says the sentence that he wants O'Brien to torture Julia instead of him we can clearly see that their fate has been decided, their souls are emptied.At the end we can see and understand how Winston feels. He sits in a cafe which he used to criticise in the beginning. He drinks the same awful vodka and plays chess just like the others who have been tortured already. It's like mere existince, agonizin, waiting for the end..This book is one of my all time favourite. Not because of it's cruelty, because it is not violent without a reason. It clearly shows that if we don't stand up and unite against totalitarism we can end up in a situation like theirs.Nowadays his book is even more actual, because we live in a society where the 'Big Brother' is watching every step of ours, where our messages, phone calls are recorded, where you unlock you password via your fingerprints. We decided to happily share every little piece of our private life on social networking sites.We make our money transfers, our job-related business deals electronically which can be easily surveyed by a third party.The mass media shows only terrible and violent acts throughout the globe, tells only half-truths, misleads people and generates a common enemy which can be the aim for our hatred..David Stuller"
1232,Hillary Steckler,"I listened to the Blackstone Audiobook, read by Simon Prebble, via Overdrive. It was a perfect reading, and I recommend this version of the audiobook. It made for great listening while I worked out and worked in the kitchen.I cannot believe that I waited so long to read this book! I never had it assigned in high school, and have filled my time with other books. In looking to catch up on some classics, I felt like I should check out 1984, and I am glad I did. It is a fantastic reflection on the power of government, and a staunch warning for us, as we continue to allow governments, schools, and other such institutions more power over our lives."
1233,Tys O'Shea,"Enhanced by Orwell's uncanny ability to create clarity and conciseness in his writing, the book was as much a sociopolitical exposé as a novel.Orwell's writing was able to impart knowledge of important and intricate concepts with its analytical style, but also to evoke feelings of real concern for the characters' safety, then disappointment in their decisions, and ultimately a harrowing sense of defeat.Orwell's propensity for long ideological ramblings could become arduous at times, often seeing the book depart on long-winded histories of some school of thought or the other, some childhood memory or the other... However, it was only upon reflection that I realised how much of the book was made up of non-narrative writing and how much I learned from the book, and thus could appreciate how difficult a task it must have been to keep the writing interesting. I applaud Orwell for his didacticism, and I wish that more people would familiarise themselves with this book."

1235,Matthew Williamson,"There isn't much that could surely be said about this that hasn't already, but I'll try! 1984 is near perfect in concept and has become hauntingly more poignant with each passing decade where what upon its release felt like an impossible fantasy now feels like impossible to imagine a world where none of it was reality. Whilst we don't quite live in this dystopia as it is, many of the problems and overt observation and attempt to control have become very blatant in today's society (Recent stories of people being arrested simply for a joke / opinion expressed on twitter & facebook reminiscent of Thought Police anyone?) But this book's strengths don't lie in just how much it's managed to successfully predict, but in the narrative on its own merits. Although not as fond of the writing structure as I once was, the slightly stagnant style lends the appropriate mindset for the situation; the writing feels suitably controlled and almost stilted in descriptives - it's not the details that are important, but that they are any details at all. Not light reading by any stretch of the imagination, in fact I wouldn't be surprised if you could go several years without reading it through again, but the actual content, strength of character and the messages within lend it a strenght that does earn a purchase. And I feel there is no greater evidence in this statement than the fact that I used to own an Orwell collection featuring this, Animal Farm and a couple of others, and when it got destroyed I found myself going out and purchasing my second copy of this particular novel just for the time I would want to read it through again. "
1236,Yuhui Li,"I read this book when I was ESL student. I heard that this is a horrible story. when I was reading that, I thought they were right. How can people live in that ocean country which control the body and thinking of citizens? No people could have their own thinking and emotion. They even can not have love, because people have to betray their lover by government's forcing. Under the sky of ocean country, people have no freedom, they just can follow, eulogize their government, big brother. I also felt stressed when I read that terrible dictatorship. But jumping out of the novel, I really like this story that describes a special background. The writhing style of author is amazing, how could he has such wonderful imagination. recommend this book!"
1237,ILHAM ALAM,"Words like ""Big Brother"" and ""Memory Hole"" have seeped into our vernacular, thanks to this depressing, scary, critical, satirical, dystopian, novel. This novel is talking about themes like government surveillance of your every move, oppression and repression, the politicizing of sex and sexual relations, the power of media and propaganda in aiding an authoritarian regime and government-sanctioned torture, which are very much relevant in our world. If you have not read this justly-famous novel, I would strongly recommend that you do so, as soon as possible. I have to warn you though, it is very bleak and depressing throughout, with an ending that feels both like an emotional escape and a trap for the main character. "
1238,Anuradha,it might be too depressing for some... but this is book not just depressing it is very enlightening in the sense that it forces us to rethink our actions not just as an individual but also as an group... how our action would affect not just us but others too and the consequences resulting from it... the image that the author is able to project in our mind is very vivid and frightening...a bleak future where we do not have a handle on our own actions.. the possibilty that even our right to choose could be taken from us. And its not just our right to choose but even the most intrinsic human activity such as the ability to think.... a future in which we can not even think as we wish is scary indeed!!!!
1239,Zainab Ali,"My thoughts while reading this book:- A society where people's emotions are controlled by what the media/ the government/ the church wants them to believe. Hmmm ... hasn't this always been the situation?- Orwell's favourite thing to describe is depressing, dirty, smelly places with disgusting food and ugly-looking, impoverished, frightening people.- Imagine a cool sci-fi version of this where the past is being constantly re-written and people are being erased from history... oh wait, the British have already done that in Doctor Who.- I can't believe how much of this was in Doctor Who.- The whole ""this is all happening. George Orwell was right"" blah blah blah...etc. - This is so frightening. I'm probably going to have nightmares this whole week.- The general state of depression I get in after every George Orwell book."
1240,Ketelen Cruz,"WOW. I am absolutely stunned by this. This is terrifying, appalling and so toxic, i couldnt put it down. I've wanted to read this for as long as i can remember, and i finally did. There are no words to express how much i loved it and how much the end only made it more sinister. All of the stars and definitely a life favorite. Full review on the blog soon. "
1241,Vishwanath Saragadam,"Throughout the book, all I could imagine was dim atmosphere, shabby apartments, controlled atmosphere everywhere and every person in factory clothes. Half way through, I was confident that the book will turn out to have a game changing plot, that INGSOC might be defeated, or perhaps the author had played my mind to make me believe so. But almost at the end, I had chills through my body. This is the second book of George Orwell I read and the ending has scrambled my mind like an egg. "
1242,Misal,"Pre-Hunger Games, I stayed as far away from the dystopian genre as I could. Frankly, it scared me. And it's difficult to put into words WHY, but I could never start and finish any book that fell into that category. 1984 was one of those books. It was only after reading a handful of YA dystopian novels that I was finally able to enjoy the genre and push my inexplicable discomfort with it aside. So naturally, I picked up 1984 as soon as I saw the chance. And it embodies everything that scared me about the genre to begin with.It is not the characters I love in this book, it is not an intricate plot, or a sense of mystery and the burning desire to know more. It's the world. Very few authors, across all genres I have read, are able to construct a world as vividly and as realistically as Orwell has here. The politics, the language, the day-to-day lives are frightening, the constant sense of surveillance, of 'Big Brother is Watching You' is claustrophobic. I wanted to put this book down, for once, I wanted to escape to MY world, to reality, and assure myself that society hadn't spiraled quite that far down yet. I read filler novels in between finishing this one because despite the manageable length of it, it wasn't an easy read. I found myself re-reading pages, trying to grasp the philosophy of Ingsoc and finding no matter how many times I re-read a paragraph, there was something horrific and new to come across every time.A book has never made me more thankful that I am not part of its world. I have never cherished the freedom of thought as much as I do after reading this. Haunting. Absolutely haunting. "
1243,Assia,pretty much the future of humanity!
1244,Leonardo,"Yeah, yeah... I'm late to the party.The book is fantastic. It's so nice when a book (or anything else, for that matter) not only meets the hype surrounding it, but surpasses it.One thing I found interesting is the fact that a lot of people take what the book is saying as a simply exaggeration (sometimes not even exaggeration) of some totalitarian regimes of our time but fail completely in seeing that a lot of it applies to our western civilization and culture.We practice doublethink everyday folks. The edition I read has an afterword by Erich Fromm where he puts it better than I could:""Books like Orwell's are powerful warnings, and it would be most unfortunate if the reader smugly interpreted 1984 as another description of Stalin barbarism, and if he does not see that it means us, too."""
1245,Stacey,"Plot Summary: *SPOILER*1984 is about a man named Winston Smith who is living in a world that is ultimately a Utopia, but not the type we would normally imagine. It isn't perfect filled with love and peace, but filled with hate and censorship, nevertheless a 'perfect' society. People listen to the government and love their leaders. However, there is a minority that exists and consists of people like Winston. People who realize that their society is warped. Winston goes about his life normally in the beginning, going to work, getting involved with the 'two minutes of hate', following the crowd in whatever they did. Until he stumbles upon a shop that contains antiques. He find a diary which becomes Winston's ""book of truth"". Winston writes his thoughts and true feelings in this diary. After getting his real beliefs on paper his thoughts start to change. He starts to realize that the Party in charge of Oceania is in fact ""evil"". Soon after this,his thoughts become actions. After going about thinking like this after a few months, he thinks that he is being followed by a spy for his 'thoughtcrimes'. However, this girl named Julia, is actually in love with him. They start to meet on various occasions to exchange conversation but it leads to more (sex). Julia thinks like Winston. They are both against the party; Julia believes that as long as she looks like she is 'pro-Big Brother' in front of other people, she can do whatever she wants in private. Her way of rebellion is by sleeping with Winston. In the midst of this sneaking around Julia and Winston do genuinely end up loving each other, even though it is expressed in secret and during their rendez-vous's. After being together for a while, they realize that there are others that think and believe like they do, which leads them to getting involved with the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood is a minority that is against the Party. They never meet together, people within the group do not know who else is in the group. The only thing that binds the members together, is 'the idea'. The idea of hate, distrust, and disbelief in the Party. Winston knows a man named O'Brien who is a part of the Brotherhood and gets both Winston and Julia involved with it. They both meet with O'brien and are sworn into the secret society. Soon after joining the Brotherhood, Winston receives a book which is a manifesto of the Brotherhood written by Goldstein, the founder. While Winston and Julia are reading the manifesto in their secret haven, the thoughtpolice find out about them and they are both sent to the Ministry of Love for their 're-education'.They are both tortured and imprisoned in the Ministry of love for months. O'Brien is in fact an interrogator of the Ministry and is not in fact their ally, he deceived them. Winston undergoes a long, painful, torture process that ultimately brainwashes him into loving, believing and trusting in Big Brother. Personal Response:I love 1984. The plot was very slow to start and the introduction of their society was a little tedious but as it progressed it became riveting. The ideas and philosophies that are brought up can revolutionize the way a person thinks. My favorite part in the entire book is when Winston is going through his stages of reintegration. That entire section was probably one of the most intriguing dialogues I have ever read. The way that O'Brien draws out the blueprint and foundations of their society is fascinating. The fact that the book is so different and mind-opening is radical. I can feel the angst and frustration of Orwell through O'Brien and the overall undertone of the story. There is one part of the book where Winston is reading Goldstein's Manifesto and I honestly think that the chapters within that manifesto is in fact Orwell's opinions on a totalitarian/dictatorship/fascist govenment/society. George Orwell was alive during a time where where many of the world's ideals were collapsing, I can only imagine what it would be like living through an age of evolutionary thinking. The sheer creativeness, raw thinking, and different ideology makes this book very enjoyable.(Small Tangent) While I was reading this book I could not help but be reminded about the movie 'V for Vendetta'. There are many similarties between the both of them. Quotes:""But after reading it he knew better than before that he was not mad. Being in a minority, even a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad."" (185)""Sanity is not Statistical."" (186)""We are the dead."" (188)""Who controls the past, controls the future: who controls the present, controls the past."" (213)""[asking about where the past exists:] In memory. Very Well. We, The Party, control all records and we control all memories. Then we control the past, do we not?"" (214)""It is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world, however secret and powerless it may be. Even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation.""

1246,Irving Alva R,Uno lee 1984 y...la policía del pensamiento me persigue.
1247,K Lynne  Duvall,"I guess if you throw a little romance in, I'm given to liking a story a lot better than normal, because normally I wouldn't read a book like 1984. The hero is part of a future society, where everything is controlled by Big Brother, a government who doesn't even like people to think nasty thoughts about them or they can be arrested. The hero manages to not only buy a diary in which to keep his thoughts, but find interest in a girl who secretly shares them, and have a sort of friendship with a high ranking official who claims to be working to take it down, but ends up as his torturer when he is discovered. I think this story does symbolically represent the way society is today in so many ways. With our internet, cell phones, credit cards, as well as so many other things our thoughts and behaviors are monitored day to day . When we exhibit behaviors that are outside of the recognized norm, they are subject to being judged. We can even be imprisoned for those thoughts and behaviors whether we did them or not. We are conditioned to hate those that seemingly don't do what we think they should in order to prove ourselves loyal to a government, religion, or whatever other institution that wants to control us. Ultimately what can we do about it though? Yes you can rebel but will it actually get you anywhere? That's what the hero learned at the end? I rated this story five stars because it made me think about the way things are, if only for a little bit."

1249,Natalia Lupușor,painfully beautiful book
1250,Christoph,"When it comes to dystopian fiction, no classic is bigger, no story more referenced, than this one. Orwell's Big Brother has not only inspired the name of the reality tv show that spawned a billion copies, it as also come closer to reality than even the author himself might have imagined.In the introduction to Animal Farm, Orwell calls himself a socialist. And yet, he was always (or at least once the disillusionment set in) extremely critical of the so-called socialist movements. He was strongly critical of the Soviet regime, even before it became popular to do so. And in this book, the ""evil empire"" that so often lies at the heart of dystopian worlds, is Ingsoc, short for English Socialism.It all comes down to an idea being hijacked by those that are only interested in their own benefit, of a democractical thought being turned into a totalitarian one. Animal Farm deals with this directly, while 1984, in a way, deals with the aftermath. Here, the regime is truly total, for it not only controls its subjects actions, but also their thoughts. This is a frightening prospect and one that, or so one hopes, despite the constant surveillance most ""free"" people find themselves under, will never truly come to pass.It is impossible to read this novel and not think about the ways in which Orwell seemingly predicted the future. This is the big reason for its timeless appeal. But there is more to it than that. The success of a totalitarian system in controlling the world (or at least a sizable chunk of it) seems much more unlikely today than it did in 1949, when this story was first published, despite the obvious parallels to our own developments the story shows. The threats that freedom, liberty, and all those other things we take for granted and lose constantly without even being aware of it, face have changed significantly. But the utter hopelessness of the situation the protagonist of this story finds himself in still feels familiar.Where other dystopian classics, such as Brave New World or Fahrenheit 451 (foremost in my mind for having recently re-read them), offer ways out of the situation, this book never does. They offer hope and solace to their heroes, fledling and meagre as it may be, but for Winston Smith there remains nothing but acceptance of the situation and a despair so deep, he can't even feel it anymore. This is what makes the world of 1984 so bleak, and why it continues to appeal to readers of every generation: there is no way out.What an incredibly hopeless message to send. What an incredibly true one."
1251,Mohamed Safwat,كُتبت عام 1949 لتتنبأ بوقائع ستحدث 1984 ولكنها وصفت ما يحدث حاليًا في عام 2013
1252,Blanche,"This goes where Ayn Rand, where Alan More, where Lois Lowry would not go: the final and ultimate apocalypse of the human spirit. This is true horror, as we watch four become five, breathing human beings become non-entities, and all things remotely human become perverted and twisted by the ever-watchful eyes of Big Brother. And when you think Orwell couldn't possible shove the knife in any further, he does. Absolutely incredible."
1253,Artur Aleksanyan,The author definitely has an exquisite style of writing. I have read the book quite quickly. Every single page is important and imformative. Not much have been changed since then. People who have a distinctive way of thinking are still under the pressure of masses. This situation is vividly outlined especially in post-soviet countries. They will try to penetrate into the place where you hide that inner You. They will decrypt the code of the lock and change You. Unfortunately this almist always happens irrevocably.
1254,Ragavendran Sn,"Even an ordinary book can hold your attention while you read it. It takes something special to stay with you long after you have finished reading it. By this logic, 1984 is one the greats. There is a roller coaster of emotions, especially in the third act which made me squirm while reading. Completely different from what I have read previously, made me question everything from my sanity to reality. I highly recommend it. Although it might leave you a bit depressed for a while after you finish reading it though."
1255,Jordan Morris,"Have you ever had a revelation that seems so obvious with hindsight that you’re not sure if it was something you once ‘knew’ but had long since forgotten?I was thinking today about George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four.Winston Smith lives in a world in which the larger-than-life Big Brother (who Winston sometimes doubts is a real person) is always watching.  BB is everywhere and can apparently even tell what one is thinking.  Winston and his lover Julia get naked in the scenic countryside where she gives him black market chocolate, the taste of which stirs thoughts that he was happier repressing.  They rent a room where they believe they’re free to talk without Big Brother and read aloud Goldstein’s book of banned knowledge - The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism.  Winston and Julia make love and wander around the flat naked and unselfconscious about it.  They eat jam and their neighbour sings what she remembers of the nursery rhyme about now-forbidden fruits ‘Oranges and Lemons’ and on the wall of the apartment is a massive engraving of the Church of St Clement.  It turns out that Big Brother has been listening all the time - there is a telescreen behind the image of the church.  They are made to stand uncomfortably naked before the BB and the Thought Police before being forcibly removed from their haven and punished.  Winston and Julia each blame and betray each other, but - in the end - at least they love Big Brother.Since I studied this twice as a student and have taught it at least twice as many times as a teacher, shouldn’t it have come up at some point that the book is a retelling of ‘Genesis’?  Because this afternoon, the idea struck me like a rat in the face.**********"
1256,Rebeca Pérez,"Uno de los mejores libros que he leído (de momento).Hacía tiempo que un libro no me emocionaba tanto. Ha sido, principalmente, angustioso y desesperante. Es casi inevitable meterse en la piel del protagonista. La impotencia que se siente, el destino escrito, esa perspectiva fatalista. Me ha dado tantísima rabia, que en parte lo he odiado. Ello ha hecho que me gustara más la novela, porque estoy convencida de que esa era la intención de Orwell, que sintiéramos exasperación, que nos enfadáramos. Obviamente, no solo genera frustración. También plantea múltiples cuestiones, todas relacionadas con la filosofía. ¿Cuán eficaz es la manipulación que los medios y los poderosos ejercen sobre las clases más bajas? ¿Y si los datos que constan como históricos son falsos? ¿Y si todos los acontecimientos actuales, políticos y sociales, son una farsa? ¿Qué tenemos que poner en duda de lo que nos cuentan? ¿Qué tenemos que creernos?Me encantaría encontrar personas con quienes poder debatir estos temas, pues me suscitan mucho interés. Gracias, señor Orwell, por cambiar totalmente mi punto de vista respecto a todo lo que hay y por haber en el mundo."
1257,Sharkslayer95,"This is my first time reading a book from George Orwell and I already like this author. He makes it easy for readers to feel for the main character in the novel, Winston Smith, who encounters a variety of treacherous and suspenseful moments in the totalitarian society of Big Brother. He provokes certain feelings from his readers by using universal references and analogies that apply to the multiple scenarios Smith experiences. Not many authors can write about a totalitarian government AND keep readers at the edge of their seat! I further recommend this book because the concept of Big Brother is not too far off from how governments used to run their country over the past century. In fact, two governments in the 1900s ran their country similar to how Big Brother ran Oceania. Adolf Hitler killed people who spoke out against him from 1933 to 1945 when he was dictator of Germany, and Joseph Stalin killed millions more of those who threatened his power than Hilter when he was the leader of the Soviet Union. All in all, Orwell gets you thinking what it would be like to live under a completely authoritarian government through the eyes of an average civilian. Who knows, there may be a time when we live with telescreens watching our every move. "
1258,Amy Layton,"This was just as wonderful to read the second time around. With my prior knowledge, I noticed even more little things that Orwell did throughout the book, and it really reinforces my belief of how wonderful an author he is."
1259,Evolots,"В тази книга преоткрих миналото, видях настоящето и прозрях бъдещето. Според мен, човек трябва да има поне малко знания от обща култура за идеологиите на фашизма и на комунизма, за да разбере книгата. Трябва да е подорителен към системата и да има око за теориите за конспирации в големи мащаби. Трябва да е циник и реалист, за да оцени реалната ‘цена’ на тази безценна книга. В интерес на истината, начинът на разказване и предаване на случващото се не ми допадна кой знае колко, но това което ме накара да продължа да чета бе не просто сюжета, а въпроса ‘Това ли е света в който сме живели, живеем и ще живеем?’ и откровеният и болезнен отговор, който бива излят върху теб, като кофа с вряла вода ‘Да!’. Макар и книгата да е фантастична, тя е отражение на гротесктният свят в който живеем. Свят в който всеки е подтискан да живее според правилата и нормите, които биват изкуствено създадени... В свят, в който интересите на големите са пред живота на малките. В свят в който властта е сила по-ценна от диамант; глупостта спасяваща, знанието и будният разум- равносилни на смърт. Книгата ще породи въпроси във вас. Какъв е смисълът да живееш в такъв свят...? Отговор няма да намерите в книгата; по-добре го търсете във себе си. Защо живеете сега...не е ли светът ни побъркан... Имаме достатъчно химични и биологични оръжия, за да унищожим планетата-нашият дом. Имаме достатъчно добре развита технология, с която властите могат да ни следят, подслушват, гледат във всяка една секунда, при това от космоса. И ако си мислите, че те не се възползват...грешите. Имаме достатъчно добре развита система, която ни държи в подчинение, разбирайте нормите на обществото и законите. Лесно биваме повлияни, могат да ни накарат да вярваме във всичко, което пожелаят, чрез манипулация, медиите, ефектът на 25тият кадър. Лесно можем да бъдем превърнати в машини за убиване, трябва само да отнемат отговорността от нашите плещи и да ни ‘ръководят’ квалифицирани и знаещи хора, факт - научно доказан. Не сме ли твърде наивни? Не се ли борим за живот и ценности, за които може би не е разумно или най-вече е безсмислено? Къде е реалността, коя е реалността; къде е истината, коя е истината? А всъщност имаме ли избор и власт достатъчна да се опълчим срещу фалшивите ценности и истини...?Покланям се пред автори като Оруел, защото знам, че за да прозреш толкова истини и за да успееш да ги разкажеш и пресъздадеш по един добър начин, не е лесна работа. Книгата е безценна и е такава заради съдържанието, което макар и достъпно за всеки, не би било разбрано в дълбочина от всички прочели я..."
1260,Anish,"George Orwell's 1984 is a very significant novel, even in the modern-day world. When it was published, way back in 1949, it must have been ground-breaking and genre-redefining. It's like an alternate reality that could have taken place, had certain post World War 2 events been different. A very possible and a deeply disturbing alternate reality. A world, where even free thinking is a serious offense, let alone free speech. A world, where the children are conditioned to admire and support a Fascist government, through clever propaganda. A world, where free thinking is punished by erasing a person's existence. Not just killing them, but erasing every trace of their entire lives, rewriting history. The most unnerving part is that much of what Orwell wrote in the book, was inspired by real history in certain countries. In the end, to merely label Nineteen Eighty Four a science fiction, is an insult to this timeless literary masterpiece. This should be taught in schools, so that mankind never has to face the grave and hopeless world portrayed in this book."

1264,Shannon Taylor,"Holy crap just wow, this made me think of so many things in detail. I would highly recommend it! There were a couple of sections that were hard and a little boring to read, but the book in its entirety was absolutely fantastic. "
1265,Captscurvy,"I was around in the 80s, and I don't remember 1984 being anything like this. In fact, it was much worse. Bad hair, bad fashion, cocaine, synth drums and keytars, neon everything, VHS, the list goes on and on. Maybe growing up in England was different. Either way, I think they got it pretty good. Much better than my 80s experience."
1266,Sammet,"Quite possibly the best book I have ever read. I practically devoured 1984, finding it hard to put down would some time re-read the same passage or couple of pages to really sink into Orwell's portrayal of a dystopian decade. I see other reviewers comments about Orwell not being that good of an author, but I beg to disagree. His language is different than that of other authors who published books in the 40's and 50's, I'll give you that, but considering his outstanding portrayal of the human mind and Winston's utter belief in humanity was, to me, breathtaking.1984 was written antecedent to its given year. In fact, what Orwell has served us is a futuristic dystopia which was written in 1948 (subsequently published in 1948). Parallels can very well be drawn from the previous world wars, the second one just about finishing as Orwell set down to write his novel. It is hardly just a work of fiction, read for ones immediate enjoyment. At the same time as it's a struggle for humanity in a world of censorship and control, it's a love story, it's a proclamation of justice and injustice, it's a political controversy, it's philosophical and pseudophilosophical theory, it's all of this and so much more.In 1984 Oceania is ruled by a totalitarian government acting under the political ideology of Ingsoc, where its Party members are under constant surveillance of telescreens displaying the face of Big Brother. Our story takes place in Airstrip One - it's a place of continuous raging war, changing between Eurasia and Eastasia (Oceania has always been at war with only one of them).(review unfinished//to be continued)"
1267,Zeynep Nur,"Hakkında o kadar çok şey söylemek istiyorum ki... Ama kurduğum bir cümle diğeriyle bütünlük sağlamıyor çünkü kitabın değindiği tek bir nokta yok. Oldukça yoğun, ağır bir kitap. Kısaca başyapıt deyip geçmek istemiyorum ama Orwell gibi bir yazarın 1984 gibi bir kitabını nasıl özetleyebilir ki insan? Bahsedilen düzen, tarih-iktidar ilişkisi, insanlardan koparılan insani duygular, sürekli savaş, sürekli nefret, büyük birader... Okurken dehşete düştüm ama asıl dehşet verici olan bütün bunların doğruluğu. Yazıldığı dönemin üstüne biraz ekleyerek yazarın öngörü yeteneğiyle bakacak olursak günümüzün de Okyanusya'dan çok farkı olduğunu iddia edemiyorum. Tele-ekranların bizleri yönlendirmesine hayır diyemiyoruz. Geçmişin değiştirilip değiştirilmediği büyük bir tartışma konusu. Aile kavramı büyüklerimizin anlattığı gibi değil, kabul etmek gerekirse kitapta bahsedildiği gibi de değil ama yakınlığı insanı korkutuyor. Orwell, bütün korkulardan yola çıkarak kapkaranlık ama güncel bir zaman dilimini bütün vahşeti ile gözler önüne seriyor ve ben okurken sadece, bütün bunların gerçekleşmemesi için daha doğrusu gerçek olmaması için yatıp kalkıp dua etmek istiyorum.Kitaptan:''Büyük birader diye biri var mı?''''Tabii ki var. Parti var. Büyük birader, partinin cisme bürünmüş halidir.''''Peki, ama benim var olduğum gibi mi var?''''Sen yoksun ki.''"
1268,Andrés,"Esta es una de las reseñas más difíciles que haré jamás. Primero porque 1984 es un clásico de calidad pura, segundo porque me gustó tanto que se me dificultará ser objetivo y tercero porque es tan complejo y completo en su historia que es difícil no soltar spoilers. Pero me aferraré (o intentaré) a mi política de “Cero spoilers” y seré firme.Todos sabemos de qué va 1984. Ese clásico que es referencia de toda distopia actual. Un libro que sabemos que tiene gran calidad sin ni siquiera haberlo leído, porque las masas lo dicen y reiteran mil veces. (Aunque el criterio de las masas últimamente viene de caída, y Divergente es un claro ejemplo. Entonces mejor no fiarse de ellas)Pero el mismo libro nos confirma eso desde sus primeras páginas. Cuando lo inicié tenía mucha expectativa, no quería salir decepcionado de un libro que prometía gustarme mucho. Pero a los 10 minutos de lectura ya estaba totalmente satisfecho con lo que leía.El libro es protagonizado (y a veces narrado) por Winston Smith. Un miembro del Partido Exterior que trabaja para el Ministerio de la Verdad. Hace años una semilla de rebeldía fue plantada en su mente, y es ahora donde parece que esta empieza a echar raíces. Ahí inicia nuestra historia, en conocer cómo es aquella superpotencia que manipula y vigila constantemente a las ciudadanos, llamada Oceanía.Tanto la historia como los personajes resultan sumamente complejos y completos. En ningún momento sentimos que los personajes son desechables o incongruentes. Orwell se encarga de mostrarnos aspectos tan correctos y completos de la psicología de cada uno, que logra construir unos personajes muy memorables que perdurarán en nuestra memoria durante una gran cantidad de tiempo. Lo mismo sucede con la historia. Tiene bases firmes y no tambalea en ningún momento. Explica absolutamente todo lo que necesitamos saber (y un poco más) para entender el mundo en el que viviremos mientras leemos. Al acabar el libro nos sentiremos satisfechos por la gran complejidad y minucioso cuidado con el que el autor desarrolla la trama, sin necesidad de dejar cabos sueltos que nos den la impresión de que el libro pudo dar más de sí.Además la misma da giros imprevistos, sin resultar inverosímiles, que alcanzan a sorprender mucho y nos hace querer seguir con la lectura hasta el fin. Junto al ritmo ágil que mantiene, gracias al estilo que tiene el autor, y una perfecta ambientación, 1984 nos sumerge de lleno en un mundo desolado de humanidad; realista, crudo y desmoralizador. Es increíble que un libro tan viejo resulte siendo tan innovador respecto a los libros actuales que tienen la misma temática. Sin aferrarse a esos clichés clásicos de la acción, nos logran dar momentos trepidantes donde el corazón se nos acelera a mil y nuestros sentidos literarios se ponen alerta a cualquier inconveniente que pueda perjudicar al protagonista. Con una historia rompe esperanzas, un ritmo endiablado, unos personajes sólidos y una profunda crítica política y social, 1984 se vuelve un libro imprescindible para todos aquellos que se consideren lectores asiduos o para las personas cansadas de la simpleza de las distopias actuales. Con plena certeza podemos asegurar que Orwell nos dio uno de los mejores libros de la historia, el cual sin duda marcará un antes y un después en la vida de quien lo lea.PD: Si tienen la oportunidad, lean el manga, que tampoco tiene desperdicio alguno."
1269,Jonfaith,"There I was, at the pub. No pints (points)for challenging the credulity, is there? Trust me, I was at the pub. Some nice enough gent was talking about the barbecue place he had opened up the street. I was half listening and half thinking, I NEED to try this man's brisket. That isn't code. He glanced down at the bar and saw 1984. He offered, oh, you're reading that again. Everyone at the public house assumes I've read everything. Jesus. I hadn't. I was a Winston Smith virgin, in fact reading it in tandem with my wife. While I never accessed the brisket, this encounter proved to be a corner of affairs. I doubt a week goes by when I don't think about this novel. I've read it twice since then. i think about Room 101 incessantly. Here's to victory gin and my favorite opening line ever: ""It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen."""
1270,Pradnya K.,"I read this book coz it was mentioned somewhere as one among the top 50 books of must read. And also because I loved Animal Farm. In nutshell, I opened it with lot of expectations. It turned out to be much more than My expectations.The story revolves around few vicissitudinous years of Winston Smiths life, in totalitarian world. Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, in London, in the nation called Oceania. Ministry of Truth alters the history of events and everything happened in the past which doesn't hold true today, or is not beneficial for the Party. The leader of Party, the omnipotent Big Brother is watching everyone, everywhere. People are being spied by their own children, monitored 24x7 by cameras and even the raise of heartbeats can be picked up which is enough to raise suspicions of conspiring against the Party, in alliance with the Emmanuel Goldstein, the leader of the rebellion against Big Brother. Every act of individual is perceived as threat. The routines of people are drawn such that they are left with no time to spend on themselves, on expression of being someone different, well, we call as freedom. Though the party members are governed this stringently, the common ones, called Proletarians, or Proles, are left without any control. They are the masses. Authors explanation to this lack of governance on Proles is that they are incapable of decisions and acts which can bring revolution enough to cause downfall of Party. Among lot of parallel facts between our civilisation and Orwell's dystopian world. Winston Smith, who is thoughtful and has left with enough brains to acknowledge individuality, is though timid, breaks as many rules as possible. He purchases diary and pen, has illegitimate relationship with Julia, rents a flat on old antiques shop. Julia, another party member, from his workplace is, in contrast to Winston, is bold, confident and sharp. She's the one who initiates the relationship between them. She seeks hideouts for their meetings, gathers black marketed stuff, hates Party and dares conspiracy with Winston and O'Brien. O'Brien is a party member who might have been a rebel once or maybe a spy who plays against rebels; one never knows. But he is the one who helps Winston to commit crime against Party. Crimes more than the thoughtcrime Winston already committed. He hates Party rules and Big Brother and when message arrives, meets O'Brien. O'Brien takes them both to his apartment and indoctrinate them to Brotherhood against Big Brother. But before than Winston read the manifesto of brotherhood he is betrayed to capture by thought police, in his rented flat. The owner of flat is a spy of Party. Comes in between the journey of Winston and his fears in the jail of Party. At last he is taken to the Ministry of love and then to the much dreaded Room 101 and meets O'Brien; in the room of light. He goes under severe physical and mental tortures but it's the mind hack of Winston what makes user cringe. In the end he betrays Julia by saying 'not to me, do it to Julia.' The love, loyalty is given up, the morals are broken, the hate is converted into love for Big Brother. There is reason why the book is banned in Russia. The totalitarian world imagined by Orwell did not come into existence in 1984. We are not yet sure how much control of human mind can be gained by tortuous procedures. I wish it's better if we never know. The control today's media has on masses is itself enough to tackle with. We lie in Proles section of Orwell's world. The twisting plot, the strong, well developed characters, sequences and the complete inexperience in such world keeps reader going on. At some times it becomes racing while others it's exploring a possibility of our scary future. One can't stop wondering can it happen? What will I do if I'd be Winston? That's mark of every successful story, of course. But we can relate easily is due to the fact that Winston is nothing but every one of us. We love freedom. We want freedom so what if to surrender to our believes. The analogy to current world is superb, the epitomes are wonderful and even the little facts are worked upon to apex. The example being Ministry of love where torture takes place, the truth hiding ministry of Truth etc, the repressive ways of freedom among many of them. Yes, it's must read for everyone who think of himself as an individual, who'd hate such totalitarian world. I mean everyone. I was not well when I read it and there came few incidents which weighed to much to tire me. The thoughts could be so draining, I never had imagined. The rat incident - I rushed through it, not able to bear. Not everyone will experience it same but the book enters your mind, that's for sure. That's for my five stars!"
1271,C.S. Hughes,"1984 is as devastating, as stimulating, as simple and complex, as thought provoking, as when I first read it as a teen. The final chapter, a small essay on Newspeak, which I undoubtedly skipped with the impatience of youth, has interesting implications. Rather than being written from George Orwell's perspective, in his present, it is written from an historical perspective, from a not too distant future in which the all-seeing, all-controlling all-powerful totalitarian Party, which seemed a psychopathic state so implacable and unstoppable to Winston Smith, has been defeated.I want to read that book, in which the Party and its seemingly unrelenting, psychopathic, true-believing functionaries like O'Brien, are defeated. I want to know how, I want to know why.The implications of a Newspeak that enriches, that expands vocabulary, rather than destroys it, that generates ideas, rather than limiting, also has intriguing possibilities.If there is one book that must be read, this is it. "
1272,Kate Heneghan,"Superb, thought-provoking, and worrisome. Overall much better than I imagined it would be!!!"
1273,Shaimaa Ali,"So it ended .. ""He loved Big Brother""!!=========================================This is my 2nd read to this Master Piece! (First in Arabic -10 years ago- and now in its native language)After reading it very slowly this time.. contemplating on every few phrases .. making mental comparisons of how the world is becoming so close to the nightmare that Orwell has imagined .. trying to feel all the type of horrors & tortures that Smith went through until he changed completely and loved the Big brother .. to care less about anything .. both Smith & Julia met but to express their hatred and betrayal .. that was deep, heart-aching and at the last few pages I wished it never ends!Describing Orwell as being a genius is not an exaggeration at all. He didn't manage only to illustrate his deepest fears of the future and how the world will look like, but he also managed to write it very early in time (written in 1948) and considered one of the early novels in Political Fiction literature genre and one among the best 100 of all time novels... I couldn't help but comparing it to ""Fahrenheit 451"" (Which needs another re-reading)- at least Ray Bradbury managed to give us HOPE .. his novel's characters survived, each one representing a complete work (i.e. The Bible, the Iliad ..etc ). But ofcourse the objectives of both novels were different as Bradbury wrote it in the McCarthy era where censorship was a sever weapon, while ""1984"" is a legend in its own.Are we going to live in 1984 world? or we are living it everyday without even realizing it?!! ------------------2+2 =5Freedom is Slavery""I betrayed you,"" she said baldly.""I betrayed you,"" he said.He loved Big Brother-------------------"
1274,Sabah,"In honour of tonight's performance of Star Wars!""So this is how democracy dies, with thunderous applause.""1984 is a chillingly dark, dystopian novel, terrifying in its edgy visionary portrayal of a warped and sadistic utopia. Given it's bleak and harrowing theme, I should have been depressed and disillusioned but instead I found this to be one of the most gripping and thought provoking dystopic novels I've read, yes even more so than Huxley's Brave New World, with Orwell's resounding message overcoming my initial reaction, to stir to life a gradual awakening. This novel, set in post WWII Europe, has three main states called Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia and although they have the same ideologies they remain perpetually at war with one another. The population of each of these states are constantly controlled, monitored, manipulated and where necessary eradicated. This novel superlatively demonstrates how psychological and physical manipulation is utilised perversely by these states to control the populace effectively. Within the novel the universal language of "" Newspeak "" has dramatically replaced English, with Big Brother restricting the amount of words permissible and therefore preventing the population from raising their voices in dissent. The significance of freedom of expression is emphasised by Orwell to outline that any modifications of language by governments can inevitably result in a loss of civil liberties. Control is the overriding theme which flows from beginning to end, through every chapter, and Orwell prompts us to ponder how we ourselves are gradually being dominated and controlled and in turn how we now implement those same ideologies on others. In this distorted utopia, every aspect of an individual's life is disciplined by the state: eating, drinking, speaking, marriage or even thinking. This to ensure infinite compliance so that all individualism is oppressed.It may be argued that in our democratic, modern, western and laudably civilised society, this dystopian ideology will never be able to gain a foothold, and therefore, 1984, is one man's paranoid vehicle of dissent. However, I would counter argue that the world depicted in this novel is already one which we inhabit today but the irony is, much like the people of Oceania, we have become gradually too brainwashed to liken the people within its pages to ourselves. The three main pivotal quotes from this novel : "" War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Stregnth, "" although contradictory statements, are nevertheless appropriately true when applied in context to the core of the state's dictates. The first quote ""War is Peace, "" is a cogent tool administered by Big Brother to steer the populations anger towards an unseen enemy rather than towards the state. The focus of the masses is then pinpointed away from the squalor of their reality, and their personal frustrations and anger are then redistributed and vented towards an unseen enemy.This similarity is prominent today in the manner in which our governments have deviated our attention towards the troubles abroad, rather than focusing on the internal problems of our own. Entire regions are now destabilised, with propaganda and fear galvanising us in to actions we may well have erred to implement. Conflicts against nations , who posed unreal threats previously to our national security, have now resulted in entire regions becoming hot beds of terrorist activity.The phrase the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few is personified in the quote ""Freedom is Slavery "" and signifies the need for the people of Oceania to relinquish their will for the greater good of the parties goals. In so doing,they are then part of a collective rather than individuals with the ability to question the states moral, social and lawful rights over them, which then permits it to command and subjugate one collective group rather than individuals with differing perspectives, therefore nullifying the possibility for change. This is relevant more so now than ever before, for when we have governments who are only willing to deal in absolutes and the world around us becomes an every permanent canvas of only black and white, I must question why I am not able to choose a wonderful, less threatening grey? Finally, in the quote "" Ignorance is Strength, "" lies Orwell's incredible genius in highlighting how the masses of Oceania genuinely believe their happiness and strength remains in being ignorant of Big Brother's activities, both internally and externally. They are happy to accept the lies and manipulations exercised against them, as this then ensures a lack of action required by them to challenge the status quo, thus ensuring the states overall complete autonomous control. Orwell magnificently opened my eyes to the dangerous nightmare that we, as a society, are sleepwalking into. We have permitted our governments to feed in to our emails, and our phone calls . We have CCTV cameras on every street corner in every town in every city and yet we remain mute because, much like Orwell's dystopian society, we are allowing for the erosion of our civil liberties to live under the cloak of a protection, which is a fallacy. I will further add that the elements of ""Newspeak"" present within this novel chill me, as I find great similarities between that twisted elimination of words to control the masses, is no different than the politically correct ideology we are forced to adopt today and how words are used artlessy to twist and manipulate us all. Another worrying facet is the perpetual war that is used to hold the people in fear and yet at the same instance elevate them to feelings of accomplishment, after all their greater sacrifices and poverty should be a burden they should welcome, shouldn't they? In their poverty lies their success and their devotion to a greater good, yet look around, isnt that what we have at present.How many of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fight a religious rivalry which has spanned over years, decades and a milenia. What is the end game? And why have we stopped questioning? I'll tell you why, because we are all plugged in. Willingly to our ipads, laptops, and just in case those failed in fixating our attention, we have our hand held mobiles, to stream us every useless, extraneous piece of drivel in case we awake and decide to pull the plug. Its lunacy but this book has become the byword by which we are being controlled globally, yet ironically, I sincerely doubt that was ever Orwell's intention!1984 is a cautionary tale and one that we should heed, as it forces us to consider the dangers of giving anyone total power and control over our lives - otherwise democracy shall die. "
1275,Kat Stark,"Hands-down, one of the best dystopian novels I have ever had the pleasure of reading.You won't understand this really unless you've read the book. There are tons of reviews already, so...high school reminiscence time!:To Myself,I just finished the last work of the day. It seems that there is always more and more coming now that Hate Week is on its way. The fiction department is a nice place to work at, but so hard to keep track of sometimes. I have to be the perfectionist and this is the only way to outsmart them. I have to continue being one of their little ""pure"" women. It feels like everything is spinning out of control and I have to maintain my balance with a letter or journal of some sort. I've managed to steal some paper and ink from my department, so I hope that maybe one day, someone will know my story.I have not been able to contact ""W"" in a while; it's been a week and I really need him. I need a release, because all of these activities are overwhelming. He's such a dear and I feel comfortable in our hiding spot. I still feel the need to change it seeing as how we go there so often, but he seems to adore the place. We treat it as a home rather than a hiding spot. I've been with other men before, but never one to be so against the party. I actually think that he believes in the Brotherhood, as if something like that could ever exist in this world. The only think they spread is lies. I bet there isn't even a war going on, just rocket bombs for the sake of frightening others.Sometimes he gets boring--""W"" I mean. He was chattering no and on about his mother one time and I tried not to fall asleep. I like him when he's not talking; less talk, more action. He may be a little on the older side and he may not be physically attractive, but he's good enough to make me feel good. I've exceeded pleasure before, but it's so hard lately to find a man that doesn't abide by the rules. They are such cowards and yet I know that they can't help their human nature. Some men can't go on living with the thought of just human sexual contact. I say that as long as you're safe and have many hiding places, then it's okay. The thing is not getting caught in the situation.I've always been good with planning and making sure that everything is done the right way. ""W"" leaves me to do all the work because of my dedication. He keeps talking about the future and such, but I don't really care much for it. Though, I'm starting to believe in what he says. I'm starting to believe that time is running out and it's quite frightening. I'm not sure if anyone will ever read this, but I felt that I should express my feelings slightly. Anyway, I won't mention much except for how I feel. I'll probably end up destroying this anyway.Sincerely,J"

1278,Haleth,"Sono passati parecchi anni dalla mia ultima lettura di questo libro, ma ricordo di averlo preferito assai a La fattoria degli animali, e nonostante il tempo trascorso la mia opinione non è cambiata.Lessi La fattoria degli animali per la scuola, e di quello non rammento assolutamente nulla, a parte l'idea netta della cancellazione di ogni speranza, che, ricordo debolmente, da un certo punto in avanti mi disgustò. Mi diede una sensazione orribile. Parlo di sensazioni fisiche: dopo averlo letto capii come si deve sentire un insetto inghiottito da una pianta carnivora.Anche 1984 cancella ogni speranza, intendiamoci, a meno che non si tenga conto di una mia piccola teoria che comunque è completamente esterna alle intenzioni dell'autore; ma questo l'ho letto due volte, e penso che prima o poi lo rileggerò una terza. Le ultime pagine sono spiazzanti, ma in 1984 trovo qualcosa che mi attira...Alla fine del libro, l'unico barlume di speranza mi veniva come dicevo da una teoria tutta mia e che quindi era un intervento del tutto esterno alla volontà dell'autore e non derivava da ciò che avevo letto: e cioè che tutto è possibile fino a che qualcuno sa cantare.Certo, anche la donna che stende i panni, che pur sembra libera, in realtà non fa altro che cantare le canzoni create dal partito.Però canta. Il che significa che prova il desiderio di cantare.Questo era il fulcro della mia teoria, non tanto che cosa cantasse. Lo so, è una teoria stramba.Ma è una teoria. Mi spiego: di teorie in La fattoria degli animali non sono riuscita a formularne. Il che significa che non sono riuscita a intervenire nel libro. E per me intervenire nel libro, anche solo come spettatrice che si muove per il paesaggio che si dipana nella narrazione, è essenziale. In La fattoria degli animali ero spettatrice, ma in ceppi; in 1984 scivolavo inesorabilmente lungo la corolla del fiore, ma in La fattoria degli animali ero intrappolata in una sostanza vischiosa che mi impediva di respirare e mi entrava in gola.Comunque sia.Tolte le estremizzazioni distopiche, 1984 non rispecchia poi così male la società odierna, almeno in potenza.Se si considera solo per un momento la cosa, non si può fare a meno di notare quanto sia semplice controllare chiunque di noi: telefonate, e-mail e conversazioni possono venire facilmente controllate; ciò che io sto facendo ora, mentre scrivo questa recensione, può essere controllato con una semplicità estrema.Qualunque cosa può venire facilmente controllata, in effetti, e si può ascoltare una conversazione singola in mezzo a una folla, ci sono punti o a volte strade intere dove le telecamere possono registrare ogni tuo singolo movimento (anche se il più delle volte non funzionano, soprattutto quando vengono commessi crimini proprio sotto il loro occhio elettronico), basta aprire Google Earth per vedere se il tizio che vive a due strade da te ha messo un'altalena in giardino.Pubblicato per la prima volta sessantaquattro anni fa, 1984 ha la terrificante proprietà di poter fungere ancora da monito, e credo che continuerà a farlo ancora per molto, molto tempo."
1279,Abdou Edge,"stopped reading this book for a while, but as soon as I got back at it, I couldn't stop reading, it is fascinating, an incredibly and scarily detailed dictatorship that can change the whole world, controlled masses, no freedoms, but again, what do we mean about that philosophically ? ... what is impressive, ( G.Orwell was a visionary) is this book was ahead of its time, maybe not, because maybe the world somehow always took a cyclic road, events that occur are similar, the changing is in the decor ( more or less ), it's crazy to see that a lot of paragraphs that I high lighted, I can apply them today on societies ( well, ""societies"" ) around the world today, including mine. I encourage anybody to read it. "
1280,Alexander Al Basosi,"After reading a classic such as this novel, I find it of the utmost importance not to make a mess of reviewing it. Not for any particular reason (since a total of one, maybe two people will probably even read this). It is for that reason that I've waited until the book has passed into my long term memory before beginning.The first thing I feel I must get out of the way, is that this book is not a happy book. It is a dull, dreary book, more akin to a nightmare than a fairy-tale. Beginning from the first page I was left with the impression that there was nothing good in the world in which Winston lived. But as the pages became chapters, I began to hope. (A dangerous emotion when it comes to this book, as all who have read this will surely know).Without giving any of the plot away, I will just say this: This was a delightfully devastating book. Upon finishing this book, I felt like someone had dipped his hands in molten steel, plunged it wrist-deep into my chest, and then ripped out my heart, arteries and all. And as far as the world George Orwell created goes, this book was next to divine. This was indeed one of the most masterfully constructed books that I've yet had the pleasure to read. This man (may he rest - hopefully far away from Oceania - in peace) has managed to make the world that he lived in blend seamlessly into this version of reality, of the superstates, of Oceania and Eurasia and Eastasia, who were in a perpetual state of warfare. If there ever was a book to be considered perfect (albeit perfectly depressing, might I add), this would come as close as a book could get. "
1281,Jeison Hernandez,"¿Te observan desde arriba o tú permites esa observación?  Una Pregunta conspiradora, una pregunta desvariada, molesta o simplemente maniática, para algunos. El regalar tu libertad publicando la vida en redes sociales o dejando que otros manejen tu vida financiera, dejar que el Estado tenga psicológicamente el régimen y el poder, permitir que tu vida sea controlada por sistemas masivos, o aceptar que el mundo necesita del oprimido ¿Una realidad distópica? O tal vez una inocultable.Observamos día a día como un primer capítulo, de una novela inventada por George Orwell en los años 40, es el equivalente a la sociedad engañosa que nos venden. Creemos que somos seres razonables por el simple hecho de firmar un tratado, en el que nos organizamos como sociedad, porque supuestamente en el fondo somos individuales por naturaleza. Clamamos por libertad, pero nos cuesta renunciar a nuestra vida social, a nuestros aparatos electrónicos, a los elementos que controlan nuestro pensamiento. Vivimos con la guerra en nuestras cabezas pero sabiendo que es algo que no nos pertenece, algo de lo que somos terceros. Observamos la injusticia y la comentamos por medios de los que no se tiene control ni se sabe la veracidad de ellos. Reducimos la moral y la lengua a su más simple expresión. Se pensaría en que la única manera cómo podemos empezar a invertir nuestra caída libre, es sacar el dogma de que el régimen, el poder o el Estado, es algo exclusivamente de políticos, más bien todos podemos ejercerlo, tenerlo y construirlo, renunciar a las instituciones financieras para que dejen de una buena vez de controlar nuestros ingresos, permitirse el gusto de conocerse y conocernos no exclusivamente por las redes sociales, hablar más y teclear menos, Aumentar nuestra capacidad de crítica y dudar de todo planteamiento (incluso de este), dejar de permitir la influencia de medios masivos de comunicación y derrocar todo aquel dirigente que no busque como fin único el bienestar común. Sería lo correcto y lo ideal, pero es desviado pensar en que si tengo a mis padres lejos utilice el servicio postal y no el teléfono o la red social que me deja hablarles instantáneamente, al no tener un contrato con el Estado que defienda mis leyes y mis derechos; robarían mis propiedades y tendría que buscar la protección de mis bienes por mis propios medios, al mismo tiempo se desatraían guerras interminables por el control de las propiedades, nuestras finanzas caerían enteras a nuestras manos permitiendo la abstención del pago de impuestos y de prestaciones sociales, que son fundamentales para mantenerse como sociedad, y para nuestro beneficio común, volveríamos a las cavernas al renunciar a nuestros aparatos electrónicos que tantas facilidades han proporcionado, hablaríamos y actuaríamos de manera tan perfecta que se juzgaría fuertemente cualquier pequeño error cometido.¿Y qué pensar?Cambiar desde nosotros y esperar como poco la sociedad se disuelve en pequeños individuos considerando así la pérdida total de nuestra libertad y la observación de un sistema al que le importan únicamente tres grandes premisas de la sociedad Orwelliana.La guerra es la pazLa libertad es la esclavitudLa ignorancia es la fuerza"
1282,Muhammad Ghonem,"قراءة فى أفكار رواية 19841-	 رواية الماضى للمستقبل، تصور هذه الرواية ديكاتاتورية جديدة ونظام شموليا اوسع من اى نظام شمولى سابق عرف او سيعرف بعد ذلك، ولذلك فإنها رواية ستظل تقرأ ثم تقرأ . صورت هذه الرواية سيطرة النظام الديكتاتورى الجديد الجماعى الذى يحكم باسم الأخ الكبير الذى اتى بعد الثورة وبعد حروب خارجية وحروب اهلية وكيف شرع فى السيطرة على الانسان من خلال سيطرته على الحالة الفكرية . كان النظام هو حزب وكان الحزب أقلية وهذه الأقلية كانت تحكم بأيدلوجية جديدة قائمة على نظرية (الإنجسوك) وهى الاشتراكية الانجليزية الجديدة وهذه الانجسوك كانت قد خرجت من عباءة الاشتراكية القديمة . كانت الانجسوك نظرية سياسية مكتملة النضوج لها لغتها واهدافها وعقيدتها .2-	 اعتبر الحزب الرغبة فى الجنس جريمة ولم يكن ذلك من اجل التعفف بل كانت العملية برمتها جريمة حتى احيانا ما كان بين الزوجين فلقد كان الهدف غير المعلن هو تجريد العملية الجنسية من كل لذة اذ ليس الحب هو العدو بقدر ماهى الشهوانية .. ولذا فكانت العملية الجنسية تعتبر جريمة اذا كان الحزب من وراء ذلك يمنع الرجال والنساء من تكوين ولاءات فيما بينهم . وحتى هذه العمليو كان يطلق عليها احيانا بين الزوجين ""صناعة طفل"" او ""الواجب تجاه الجزب"" اى الانجاب من أجل الحزب وللحزب الذى يامر بالانجاب حرية التصرف فى الاطفال وان كانت رؤية الحزب لهذه العملية فى المستقبل ستختلف كثيرا عما هى عليه الان فلن يكون هناك معاشرة فعليه فسيكون الانجاب عن طريق التلقيح الصناعى او غيره من وسائل حديثة . وكان ذلك من اجل وأد العلاقات الأسرية دون انحلال الرابطة وقتل المشاعر لأن أبشع ما قام به الحزب أنه كان يحاول اقناع الناس بأن مجرد الدوافع والمشاعر لم تكن بذات قيمة . وايضا لم يكتفى باحكام سيطرته على الفرد داخل الاسرة من خلال ذلك بل ايضا درب الاطفال وعلمهم الوشاية بأبائهم الذين يفكرون؛مجرد التفكير فى اى شى ضد الحزب او الاساءة الى الاخ الكبير او حتى مجرد التفكير المطلق . إلى جانب هذه الجريمة –الرغبة فى الجنس- كانت هناك جريمة اخرى لا تقل عنها فى العقوبة بل كانت هى الجريمة الافظع وكان عليها العقاب الانكى . وكانت هذه الجريمة؛ التفكير . نعم، التفكير. ولا فرق فى التفكير فى الاثم – الجنس او التفكير- او اقترافه .3-	 لغة الحزب : كان للحزب لغة جديدة ولم تكن مهمة العاملون على صياغة هذه اللغة ابتكار كلمات جديدة بل تدمير الكلمات ولذا فكان التدمير كثيرا ما يكون فى النعوت وكان التخلص من مترادفات واضداد الكلمة فمثلا لا حاجة لكلمة سىء او ممتاز ورائع اذا كانت كلمة جيدة موجودة فيستخدمون عوضا عن ذلك غير جيد لكلمة سىء وجيد جدا او جيد جدا جدا لممتاز ورائع وكانت الغاية من هذه اللغة الجديدة التضييق من أفاق الوقوع فى الجريمة من الناحية النظرية لانه لن توجد كلمات يمكن للمرء من خلالها ان يرتكب هذه الجريمة وكان القصد من وراء ذلك ايضا ان يتضاءل مدى الوعى والادراك شيئا فشيئا وحتى يعزز ذلك عدم امكانية اقتراف جريمة فكر . من ضمن مصطلحات هذه اللغة الجديدة الذى سعى الحزب على تاكيدها ونشرها على نطاق واسع نجد مصطلح التفكير الاذدواجى ويقع هذا المصطلح فى صميم مبادئ الاشتراكية الانجليزية باعتبار ان المنهج الرئيسى للحزب هو استخدام الخداع الواعى مع الاحتفاظ بثبات الغاية التى تظل محاطة بالصدق ولذا فان معنى التفكير الازدواجى هنا : الاستحواذ على الحقيقة ونوضح ذلك بالمثال الذى فرضه الحزب على الجميع . ان 2+2=5 لان الحزب هو من قال ذلك فعلى الايمان بذلك واذا راى الحزب غدا ان 2+2= 4 او حتى 3 فعلى الايمان بذلك ولان فاننى اعرض نفسى لخطر الموت؛ اقصد التعذيب حتى الموت .لان انكارى فى هذه الحالة هو بمثابة جريمة فكر وخروج عن طاعة الجزب والاخ الكبير . المصطلح الثانى فى هذه اللغة هو التفكير الصالح : ويعنى الولاء الحق الذى يكنه الشخص للحزب كما ان معنى حسن التفكير اى ان تكون مخلصا للحزب وغيرها من المصطلحات الاخرى . 4-	 العقيدة : كانت العقيدة الرئيسة للحزب هى تبديل الماضى ولذا فكان للحزب شعارا يتعلق بالتحكم فى الماضى وهو "" من ينحكم فى الماضى يتحكم فى المستقبل ون يتحكم فى الحاضر يتحكم فى الماضى"" وبما ان الحزب يتحكم فى الحاضر فقد نسف كل الماضى الذى لا يروقه حتى يمكنه الاستمرا فى المستقبل بل والتحكم فيه ومن اجل ذلك كان الماضى ماهو الا ما كان محفوظا فى السجلات او فى الذاكرة واما ما كان فى السجلات فقد تم تغييره تماما ولم يعد للماضى المعروف اى اثر فالماضى هو الماضى الذى يريده الحزب فالحزب هو من اخترع الطائرة واى شىء قد يخطر على البال بل وكل شىء ينسب الى الحزب واما الذاكرة التى تحمل الماضى فقد كان يتم تنقيتها من الشوائب هذه العالقة بها على طريقتهم حتى يرجع صاحب هذه الذاكرة ويعترف بان ليس له ذاكرة غير ذاكرة الحزب وما الماضى الا الماضى الذى يراه الحزب فعلى سبيل المثال كان الحزب الذى يحكم اوقيانيا فى حرب مع اوراسيا لبضع سنوات ثم ابرموا معاهدة صلح وعلى اثرها دخلت اوقيانيا فى حرب مع استاسيا بعدها ببضعة ايام كان على الشعب او بالاخص اعضاء الحزب ان يؤمنوا بان هذه الحرب الذتى كانت منذ سنوات انما كانت مع استاسيا.واذاكان الاخ الكبير قد قال شيئا اوتوقع شيئا وحدث العكس فان السجلات والكتب التى ذكرت هذا الخير تعدل فى ساعتها اذا خاب التوقع وعلى الناس ان يؤمنوا بان ما قاله الاخ الكبير هو ما حدث .5-	 بناءا على هذه المتناقضات فى الفكر الذى احدثة الحزب بعد اعتناق الناس لما امر من ازدواجية الفكر نجد ان هناك ايضا الاربع وزارات التى تحكم تبدى بعض من الصفاقة فيما تمارسه من قلب الحقائق فوزارة السلام معنية بالحرب ووزارة الحقيقة هى الوزارة التى كانت تقوم على التزوير فيما يخص السجلات والكتب ونقل المعلومات وغيرها ووزارة الحب هى الوزارة التى تسوم الناس العذاب فهى الوزارة التى يتعرض فيها مجرمى الفكر لاشد العذاب ووزارة الوفرة ما كانت تعنى بشىء غير تجويع الناس وهذه المتناقضات كما قلت من ممارسات ازدواجية الفكر . ولم يمكن للحزب الاحتفاظ بالسلطة الا عبر التوفيق بين المتناقضات فلكى تحتفظ الطبقة العليا-الحزب- بموقعها من السيطرة على السلطة فكان عليها السيطرة على الحالة الفكرية . وكان للجزب شعارات ثلاثة مكتوبة على وزارة الحقيقة وهى الحرية هى العبودية .. الحرب هى السلام .. والجهل هو القوة ونقف سريعا عن شعار الحرية هو العبودية لنعلم ان المقصود به هو ان حرية الفرد ووحدته تؤدى به الى القهر وتجعله المغلوب دائما ليكون مصيرة حريته عبودية وهذا ما يفسره ايضا معنى السلطة وكيفية التحكم فى السلطة من الحزب .6-	الفرق بين هذه السلطة-الحزب- وغيرها هو ان هذه السلطة لم تكن فردية فقد جرت العادة ان تحاول الطبقة الوسطى ان تتاجر بقيم مثل الحرية والمساواة من اجل زحزحة الطبقة العليا عن السلطة ولكن الامر لم يفلح مع هذه الحزب الذى كان يعلم ان الركيزة الوحيدة لبقاء سلطته هو الا تكون سلطته فردية بل فكرة الجماعية وفاذا اعتبرنا السلطة هذه ملكية فانها ليست كاى ملكية اخرى تقع فى ايدى عدد قليل ومتفرقون كالملكيات الخاصة المعروفة لكن فى هذه الحالة فالملكية موحدة الى جانب كونها ملكية من محموعة وليست عددا قليلا ولكن على الصعيد الفردى لا يمتلك اى من اعضاء الحزب شيئا واما بالنسة للصعيد الجماعى فان الحزب يملك كل شىء . وهكذا فالسلطة جماعية والسطة فى هذه الحالة هى السلطة على البشر على اجسامهم وعلى عقولهم قبل كل شىء كما انهم يسيطرون على المادة واذا اعتقد احدا بكذب هذه المقولة وهى سيطرتهم على المادة لكونهم سيعجزون على السيطرة على الطقس او قانون الجاذبية مثلا او المرض والالم والموت نجد انهم يمكنهم ذلك ما داموا يسيطرون على العقل والواقع فبامكانهم ان يقنعوا الناس باى شىء شاءوا ما داموا يسيطرون على عقولهم ولذا فان السلطة التى كانوا يقاتلون من اجلها ليل نهار ليست السلطة على الاشياء بل السلطة على الانسان وذلك ايضا عن طريق ايلامه لان هذا العالم طبقا لرايهم لا مكان فيه لعواطف غير الخوف والغضب باذلال الذات .7-	نظرة الحزب للعوام كانت نظرة دونية ولم يكن يأبه بتجنيدهم أو انضمامهم اليه إذ لم يكن من المرغوب فيه ان يكون لدى عامة الشعب وعى سياسى قوى بل كان المطلوب منهم ان يكونوا وطنيين فلابد من وجود وطنية بدائية يمكن اللجوء إليها حينما يستلزم الأمر إقناعم بقبول سلعات عمل أطول أو حصص أقل من السلع التموينيةز ولم يكن الحزب يأبه لهم وما يعتقدون به فلأمر عنده سيان أن يؤمنوا بالله او لا ان يتزوجوا أو لا 8-	انصح بمشاهدة هذا الفيلم القصير عند قراءة الرواية

1283,Odet Rahmawati,"Sempat berhenti selama dua bulan di halaman lima puluhlan kalau nggak salah, karena pusing saat menerima info-info dari buku ini. Namun setelah membaca ulang dari awal, ternyata bukunya bagus banget. Masih agak mengernyitkan dahi sih, tapi semua penggambaran dunia yang direka oleh Orwell ini berasa banget. Kota yang pengap, berdebu, gersang, bau apak, itu serasa menempel di sekitar saya selama membacanya.Ngeri. Ngeri. Ngeri. Kata itu tampaknya tepat untuk menggambarkan kehidupan di buku ini. Bagaimana sebuah kekuasaan Bung Besar mampu mengubah apa pun. Masa lalu dihapus, sejarah diubah sesuai kehendak/kepentingan Partai, sehingga orang-orang yang hidup di masa kini tidak tahu menahu soal sejarah atau masa lalu.Selain itu, di dunia ini, orang tidak boleh merasakan jatuh cinta selain kepada Bung Besar. Tidak boleh ada hasrat apa pun, tidak boleh ada perlawanan atau pemberontakan pada apa pun yang tidak mereka kehendaki. Jika tidak, maka bersiap-siaplah ditangkap oleh polisi pikiran dan diuapkan, dilenyapkan. Sebab tidak ada yang bebas di dunia ini. Setiap gerak-gerik, bahkan pikiran dalam kepala, diamati dengan cermat. Di mana-mana ada perekam suara dan teleskrin--semacam kamera pengintai yang bisa ngamuk-ngamuk kalau ada pelanggaran. "
1284,Guido,"Brillante análisis de un sociedad distópico gobernada por el totalitarismo, la censura y la opresión. Sólo espero que nunca llegemos a la situación que describe este libro-ensayo. Aunque no estamos muy lejos en algunos aspetos de eso. "

1286,Ebenezer McHumbug,"This book is a classic for a reason! It makes a very good argument and the scary thing is that one can compare some of the thing in this book to real life! The ending was bittersweet, but it is very appropriate. If anyone were to ask me about this book I would say, ""your library isn't complete without it"". "
1287,Yegana Abbaszade,"Anti- utopian novel. In my opinion the main purpose of the book is to show us that no matter what you do and where you live there is always be people who will always watch over you from the other side of the screen. And no matter how hard you try you will never be able to fight against them, as they read your mind and can control it. Sounds creepy huh? "
1288,Flynn Metcalfe,"This is the book 1984. It is about a normal man who thinks quite like all of us and has similar problems that we may have, except he has got it bad. This is the fictional dystopian story of Winston smith’s life. Winston Smith is a man who lives in a world where the government is severely corrupted and is an oligarchy on a mission for full power. A mission to control life and nature. Throughout the story Winston finds himself struggling to keep his thoughts of hating the government to himself for since he works within the party(the government) he is constantly watched and spied on by telescreens (TV ’s with hidden cameras in them) hidden mics. He believes that a coworker Brotherhood ( th alongside e resistance against the Party) him works for the and little He finds himself constantly hating th e Party because Winston knows that they have controlling the minds of millions. corrupt the world and are They literally can snap their fingers and change history like that.

Anyone who enjoys bit of controversy, conspiracy and rebellious behavior, or if you like stuff about the governm ent. I think anyone who has heard of how the government and can listen to you talk thr a g o ough your phone or your smart TV, od prediction of what is to come. This can look at you through your phone’s camera would like this because I think that this book is book is meant to be taken as a warning to us and The ability to see people through telescreens in the story quite frankly relates to the ability of our government now looking through people’s phone cameras. I think anyone who is interested in governmental issues would love this book.I loved this book. I will Give it a 5 star rating> I thought that the whole idea of a corrupt government on a mission for total control was really cool and sounded very interesting. And it was. The book was long and was definitely a hard read but it was a good read. There were parts in the book that I would have to reread to really grasp what it was trying to say. So yes there were some confusing parts and there were some parts in the boo that were very long and never I think you will too.k ending boringness. But in the end it is all worth it. It is a good book, I liked it and I think you will too."

1293,Salymar,"If you were frightened and terrified to the point of panicking; Panicking in the sense that your mind became alert with the inconceivable yet threatening situation of Katniss from The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, Beatrice (Tris) from Divergent series by Veronica Roth, Kathy H and her friends in Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go and many other characters from Dystopian Novels; Think Read again. I never felt the same way in George Orwell's 1984. This novel is much more frightening, threatening, thought-provoking and dreadfully powerful dystopian and satirical novel. You will unbelievably run from your sleeves because the visuals almost seem to seep into the pores of your skin, intoxicating you with dread and ache. This another novel that will stay with me forever, especially the words: WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. These words keep haunting my head since I read this book.1984 should not be read for fun, but with utmost curiosity and seriousness. The plot is amazing and (just like I always say from the moment I write this review) Frightening. If you learned Political Geography from your school then this would be easy for you.The world in 1984 is divided into three states, originated from the remains from World War II: Oceania (Western Hemisphere, the British Isles, Australasia and Southern Africa), Eurasia (Continental Europe and Russia, including Siberia), and Eastasia (China, Japan, Korea, and Indochina --also described as the rest of the world.) Imagine the scenario. The story began with the ""Atomic War boy"", Winston Smith, he grew up as a middle-aged man who endures a filthy existence in the totalitarian “superstate” of Oceania under the constant surveillance of the Guards they call, Thought Police. He became a low Political Party official in the Ministry of Propaganda. (If you think that sounds okay, think again). Despite of his Pro-Government position he still lives in a dirty and mini-room, and works in a small office cubicle. Their job is to rewrite history and ""erase"" anyone who has fallen afoul of the government in accordance with the dictates of the Party/State and its oh-so-supreme-figure-head, Big Brother (yes, he rules Oceania).Winston fate changes when he met an overt ""rebel from the waist downwards"" who publicly espouses Party doctrine as a member of the fanatical Junior Anti-Sex League, Julia. It turns out that they are both fed-up with the whole system of tyranny/the totalitarian system. I'm going to skip some scenes and give you the ending After Winston and Julia are separated and taken away to be detained, questioned and brutally rehabilitated because they were caught in the night of June 1984 with a small telescreen hidden behind a picture on the wall...And I will stop with their journey in that precise moment. Let the curiosity move you to read this novel.The slogan WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.War is peace because of the continuous warfare between the three states that exist in the world of 1984 who hold different and similar ideologies. They have to keep the society's order and peace. If you remember the slogan: If you wish for peace, prepare for war"" (usually interpreted as meaning peace through strength—a strong society being less likely to be attacked by enemies. That explains the first slogan.The second slogan, Freedom is slavery, simply means in order to gain freedom: freedom of speech and anything else, you must first allow yourself to be included in the Party, in other words, letting you to be part of the slaves, because that way, the oppressor doesn’t have the means to destruct you.Last but not the least, the slogan: Ignorance is strength, I think it is about the division of social classes (Big Brother atop, The Party in middle, the Proles at bottom, in 1984 or simply the  Proletariat, Middle Class and the Bourgeoisie). Ignoring it will be your strength because in 1984, those classes do not seem to change because the poor will still do as they are told in a very, very irrational way and the rich will keep on loading for more and they will still uphold the law. The state will maintain its structure by torture, exploitation, violence, and brainwashing."
1294,zeez,"""...In a sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was part of the attraction. It said what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. It was the product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously more powerful, more systemic, less fear-ridden. The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already.""Aside from the devastating end that I found was very exaggerated it was a Genius book that holds a great sense of reality between it's lines, the author had me experience what 'Doublethink' really is by the conversion of what Winston thought was true to a complete delusional scheme and finishing the book feeling overwhelmed with so many questions like what is the secret that is beyond our power and who really controls it? "
1295,Joseph,"1984 by George Orwell is a novel that is one of a kind. Whatever book you happen to be reading put it down and start reading this novel. 1984 tells narrates the story of a utopian government ruling over a certain part of the world. In this so called utopia the government calls itself The Party, and it is divided into three different classes. The first and richest being the inner party, the second and the one that is considered the middle class is called the outer party, the third and poorest call themselves the proles,a class that has no business or interference with the party. The proles live alone and do as they wish. The party members however live in houses appointed to them by the inner party. These houses contain tele screens that look over their each and every action all the time. In this community the party members worship big brother, a man who is the founder of the Party, but who is never seen even though he is said to be alive. The party has a crime called thought crime which was created to protect the party. Whoever the party believes to be guilty they take in and either torture or hang the so called criminal. The main character of the novel is Winston Smith, a man who secretly hates The Party but acts as if he loves everything about it including big brother. Winston meets a girl that he falls in love with and he starts meeting her at secret hideouts, in order to make love. One day a member of the inner party slips Winston an inconspicuous note with his address on it, that tells him to meet him at his house. He goes to the house with the girl he is in love with called Julia. There the member of the inner party called O'Brien makes him confess that he wants to conspire against The Party, then tells him that there is a secret organization that is fighting against The Party called the brotherhood. Two weeks later while Winston was in the hideout with Julia the inner party patrols got hold of them and took them away to an unknown place where they take all thought criminals. There Winston is kept for several years and tortured by O'Brien until he was convinced into thinking that everything the party says is correct and that all the lies they feed them are true and are not lies. Years later Winston leaves The Party's hostage into the real world a totally different man, he is now the Party's ""ideal"" citizen. This novel which was written in 1949 shows us a small glimpse of where technology may be leading us. George Orwell reveals the scary truth that may be awaiting us in the near future."
1296,Fyodor Kafka,"من الصعب جداً كتابة مراجعة لهذه التحفة الأدبية السياسية الاجتماعية العظيمة.. فهي من النوع الذي تخرج بعد قراءته محملاًُ بعبء هائل من الاقتباسات والأفكار والنقاشات والأسئلة المفتوحة.. إنها عصف ذهني بكل معنى الكلمة، وفي مراجعات القراء الموجودة هنا قدر كافٍ لا أستطيع الإضافة عليه. ومهما قيل عن هذه الرواية فالكلام عنها لن ينتهي.من روائع الأدب العالمي. أقرب إلى كونها كتاباً سياسياً عميقاً من كونها رواية بالمعنى الحرفي. كثيراً ما تقارن برواية سبقتها بعدة سنوات وهي رواية ""Brave New World"" لأولدس هكسلي التي أنصح كذلك بقراءتها. بالنسبة لنهاية الرواية فقد كانت واقعية جداً ومنطقية. وبرأيي أن هذه النهاية ليست محبطة ومدعاة لليأس كما قد يبدو للوهلة الأولى، بالعكس أرى أن هذه النهاية لها مفعول معاكس تماماً، فلو انتهت الرواية بسقوط الحزب الحاكم وانتصار الخير فقد يكون لذلك على القارئ أثر مخمد يضعف من حماسه للتغيير وستترسخ عنده قناعة بأن الخير لا بد أن ينتصر يوماً ما وقد لا يكون ذلك في زماننا، نفس الفكرة ترد في رواية أورويل الأخرى ""مزرعة الحيوان"" حيث كانت الحيوانات تتراخى في القيام بالثورة لأن العجوز ميجور طمأنهم بأنها لا بد أن تقوم يوماً ما سواء عملوا لذلك بأنفسهم أم لا. أما النهاية الواقعية السوداوية التي اختارها أورويل فهي تنسجم مع الهدف الحقيقي لرواية 1984: إن هذه الرواية ليست تنبؤية في الواقع بقدر ما هي تحذيرية وتعبر عن هاجس الكاتب وخوفه من شهوة السلطة المطلقة في الإنسان وماذا يمكن أن تفعل بنا لو أطلقنا لها العنان ووصلت لنموذجها المثالي المكتمل الذي تخيله أورويل. عندما تريد أن تخوف طفلك مثلاً من عواقب عدم الاهتمام بدراسته تقول له: عندما تصبح شاباً ستكون عاطلاً عن العمل ومشرداً لا تجد لقمة يومك، وتصور له كيف ستكون النتائج الكارثية المترتبة على إهماله لدراسته لتحذره من المستقبل، وهذا هو هدف رواية 1984 فأورويل يقول لنا: إن لم تستفيقوا وتعوا وتثوروا فهذا هو النظام الذي سيحكمنا في المستقبل. عندما يتخيل أحدنا نفسه مكان وينستون بطل الرواية فإن النهاية ستجعله يصرخ بتحدي ويقول: لا... لو كنت أنا مكان وينستون فلن أقبل أبداً بأن أحب الأخ الكبير ولن أستسلم ولن أرضخ وسأبقى إنساناً حتى الرمق الأخير، ولن أسمح أصلاً لهكذا حزب بأن يصل إلى قمة السلطة ويتحكم بأقدارنا بهذا الشكل. هذه صرخة التحدي التي يريدها منا أورويل بأن نصنع بيدينا مستقبلاً مشرقاً ولا نسمح لهذه الصورة السوداوية التي يحذرنا منها بأن تتحقق. من أعظم وأخطر أفكار الرواية هي أن السلطة المطلقة بنموذجها المثالي تتجسد في السيطرة على العقول بدلاً من الاهتمام بالسيطرة على الأجساد والعالم المادي، وهو ما يتلخص بفكرة غسيل الدماغ. إذا استطعت أن أزرع في أدمغة الناس أن الحليب أسود فلم أعد بحاجة إلى تحويل الحليب فعلاً إلى اللون الأسود وخرق قوانين الطبيعة لأنني بإقناعي الناس بأن الحليب أسود أكون قد وصلت لنفس النتيجة!! صحيح أننا لم نصل في زماننا لهذه الصورة المخيفة وهي غسيل الدماغ المباشر لكنها موجودة بشكل آخر من خلال أجهزة الإعلام المتلاعبة بالعقول (والتي سبق أن صورها أورويل ببراعة مذهلة من خلال شخصية الخنزير سكويلر في مزرعة الحيوان)، فإذا استطعت من خلال الإعلام أن أغرز في عقول الجمهور أن الدولة الفلانية مجرمة والجهة الفلانية انتصرت في المعركة الفلانية فلا يهمني إن كان الواقع على الأرض مغايراً لذلك.ملاحظة أخرى لفتت نظري تدلل على مدى عبقرية جورج أورويل ومصداقية ما يطرحه من أفكار.بعد أن تم تطويع وينستون في وزارة ""الحب""!! بحيث أصبح قادراً على الاقتناع بأن 2 +2 = 5 وبكل ما يقوله الحزب، كان لا بد من إخضاعه عاطفياً وذلك بقتل حبه لجوليا، وسبق لوينستون أن اعترف بأن خيانته الحقيقية لجوليا ليست بالاعترافات والكلام لكن ستتم لو نجحوا في جعله يخونها في قلبه ويتخلى عن حبها حقيقةً.وقد تمت هذه العملية في الغرفة 101 التي تحوي أسوأ ما في العالم، وهو الجرذان بالنسبة لحالة وينستون. وبمجرد أن أحس وينستون بخطر الجرذان التي قد تبدأ بنهش وجهه في أية لحظة سرعان ما فكر بطريقة يفتدي بها نفسه من هذا العذاب الأليم فإذا به يصرخ بكل ما أوتي من قوة: ""لا تفعلوا هذا بي ولكن افعلوه بجوليا""!! وهكذا يكون قد خان جوليا فعلاً وتخلى عن حبها لأنه لم يقل هذا الكلام فقط للتخلص من العذاب بل هذا كان شعوره الحقيقي في أعماق قلبه عندما تم إخضاعه لهذا العذاب الرهيب.عند هول هذا الموقف تخيلت نفسي مكان وينستون وطرحت على نفسي هذا السؤال: لو كنت مكانه هل كنت حقاُ سأخون أقرب أحبائي إلي وسأطلب أن يؤتى بهم ليتعرضوا لهذا العذاب بدلاً مني؟؟ لماذا اختار وينستون جوليا تحديداًُ من بين كل سكان الأرض ليفتدي بها نفسه؟وبعد تفكير طويل خطرت ببالي آية من القرآن الكريم تصور هذه الفكرة!! إن أشد ألوان العذاب هولاً ورعباً يمكن أن يواجهها الإنسان بكل تأكيد هو عذاب يوم القيامة ونار جهنم التي أعدها الله للكافرين المستكبرين عن عبادته في الدار الآخرة، ويقول الله تعالى في كتابه واصفاً فزع الكافر من هذا العذاب حين يعاينه ورغبته في افتداء نفسه: ((يود المجرم لو يفتدي من عذاب يومئذ ببنيه * وصاحبته وأخيه * وفصيلته التي تؤويه * ومن في الأرض جميعاً ثم ينجيه)) وكما يتضح من هذه الآية الكريمة فإن الكافر قد بدأ يفتدي نفسه قبل كل شيء ببنيه وهم أقرب الناس إليه ثم انتقل إلى الأبعد فالأبعد!! وهنا تأكد لي حقاً صدق ما افترضه جورج أورويل عن السياسة التي يستخدمها الحزب في السيطرة على مشاعر وعواطف الشعب وجعل المعتقل يخون أحب الناس إليه من أعماق قلبه.أبدع أورويل كذلك في صياغة تفاصيل النظام الحاكم في أوقيانيا ومبادئ الحزب الحاكم حتى تخيلت للحظة بأن هذه التفاصيل مستقاة من وثائق سرية لتأسيس دولة وحزب حقيقيين يطبقان هذه المبادئ فعلياً وأن أورويل كان مطلعاً على هذه الوثائق وصاغ منها روايته!! وربما يكون العكس هو الصحيح فأحياناً أشعر بأن زعيم كوريا الشمالية قد استوحى مبادئ دولته من هذه الرواية!! فكرة التفكير المزدوج منسجمة تماماً مع شعارات الحزب: الحرب هي السلام، الحرية هي العبودية، الجهل هو القوة، ومنسجمة كذلك مع أسماء الوزارات: وزارة الحقيقة ووزارة الوفرة ووزارة الحب!!! عندما مرت بي تسمية ""وزارة الحب"" أول مرة خلال قراءة الرواية تصورت أنها تسمية ساخرة، لكن مع التقدم في الرواية والغوص في أعماق المدعو أوبراين واكتشاف أساليب الحزب وإيديولوجيته العجيبة اكتشفت أن التسمية منسجمة تماماً مع مبادئ الحزب فهي فعلاً وزارة هدفها ليس تعذيب وإذلال المعتقل جسدياً (وإن كان هذا يتم فعلاً لكنه ليس الهدف الحقيقي المنشود) وإنما غسل دماغه والسيطرة لا على أفكاره فحسب بل أيضاً على مشاعره وجعله يحب الأخ الكبير! من إبداعات أورويل كذلك فكرة اللغة الجديدة newspeak وفلسفتها القائمة على تحريف وتشويه الفكر بل وإلغاء إمكانية التفكير نهائياً من خلال تشويه اللغة والمصطلحات!! كم أدهشني وصف سايم الدقيق لهذه اللغة والنتائج المترتبة عليها في المستقبل وكيف تنبأ وينستون بأن سايم سيتبخر في سجون وزارة الحب لأنه يفهم زيادة عن اللزوم! وهكذا حزب لا يريد عقولاً تفهم بل يريد أتباعاً ساذجين مغفلين. لقد أبدع أورويل في صياغة مبادئ وقواعد هذه اللغة الجديدة وكأنها فعلاً لغة حية حقيقية هناك من يتحدث بها ويستخدمها! باختصار كانت أوقيانيا التي تخيلها في الرواية رغم ديستوبيتها دولة حقيقية من لحم ودم!! ويشهد على عظمة الرواية نجاح أورويل في إدخال مصطلحات جديدة إلى اللغة الإنجليزية مستقاة ومقتبسة من روايته الخالدة!"

1298,Katherine Kelly,"This is such a classic, and so often referred to in other works, that I felt like I must have read it but couldn't remember the specifics of the plot so I decided to re-read it. It made a profound impact on me - I can't believe a book written so long ago could have such application for the world we live in now:- Newspeak: Reminds me of how we've started adjusting our language based on texting and tweeting...of course it's not backed by the political reasoning in the book but still an interesting parallel.- Big brother: We may not have big brother per se but through social media we as a society are almost starting to act together as a sort of big brother. Think about people getting fired for Facebook/Twitter update. Or the ""Flesh Search"" trend in China (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/mag...) where people use the internet to find, and punish, people for morality crimes that the community has deemed ""illegal""There are more of course but those two stand out to me. If you haven't read this book since high school I recommend picking it up again and reading it in the context of our daily news (for example, in the book they defend the ""war is peace"" line by explaining how beneficial war is to keeping society running...then consider our ongoing war with dubious beginnings and see how your perspective shifts) I think you'll get a lot of insight out of it."

Non si stabilisce una dittatura nell'intento di salvaguardare una rivoluzione; ma si fa una rivoluzione nell'intento di stabilire una dittatura. Il fine della persecuzione è la persecuzione.

1300,Puty P,"Bringing fear, sharp chill on the back of your neck and also desperation. Great classic that's still relevant and will always be relevant as it approaches politic and power through human nature: very basic and universal."
1301,Stuti Gurtoo,"The more you read, the more you are disappointed by the circulation of ideas and recurring themes represented through different genres and in different times. As it turns out, the book I read recently, and loved - V for Vendetta - is based loosely on the concepts in 1984. Both set in London, describe an oppressive regime that monitors people all the time.""Asleep or awake, working or eating, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed - no escape. Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimeters inside you skull."" - 1984""I shall die here. Every last inch of me shall perish. Except one. An inch. It's small and it's fragile and it's the only thing in the world worth having. We must never lose it, or sell it, or give it away. We must never let them take it from us."" - V for VendettaI've just started this book, but I hope there are portions of it that have not been taken and twisted and wrung and endlessly reused by other works (I've read) since its publication.""What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.""In 1984, the government spends a lot of effort in ""rectifying"" the past by deleting or adding to the vast amount of information but the protagonist finds a photographic evidence of a cover up - the wrongful conviction (and hanging) of some rebels. ""It was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself, as well as the event it recorded, was only memory.""Strangely, Milan Kundera's Book of Laughter and Forgetting begins with the same motif - a photograph taken of two prominent Czech leaders one of who was later erased by the prevailing government after he was accused of treason and hanged. After the Prague Spring, a lot of these doctored instances of the country's history under communism were uncovered. Communist leaders who had been purged, imprisoned, or executed were systematically erased from history. Sadly, this isn't a work of fiction that drew inspiration from 1984. On the contrary, it's likely that this ""erasing of history"" was a prevailing practice at the time and it inspired George Orwell."
1302,Νόρα,"Ένα βιβλίο το οποίο σε αφήνει άφωνο με το πόσο μέσα θα μπορούσε να πέσει κάποιος,για σήμερα,γράφωντας το 70 χρόνια πριν.Πόση γνώση(;).Αναμφίβολα το καλύτερο βιβλίο που έχω διαβάσει ποτέ και έχει επηρεάσει τον τρόπο σκέψης μου όσο κανένα άλλο...! "
1303,Rachel George,"I was not assigned to read this in high school. I had a few friends and even more class- and teammates that were, because they took the fancy smart advanced English class. I was, however, one of those nerdy kids that actually liked reading, and hoped that I would get that assignment...but I never did. For some reason, that kept me from reading the book all through high school and a year or two after. When I finally did get around to checking it out from the library, I found myself struggling to become immersed in the storyline. I finally did ""read"" it when I found a cd recording. I no longer had to find time between work and my small child--I could ""read"" while commuting! This worked beautifly, almost too well, because I'd get my headphones on and listen at work.[without further ado, the actual REVIEW]Like Brave New World, this dystopian novel has managed to take an accurate prediction of the future and scare all unassuming citizens who read it. At first, I thought, ""Well, that's ridiculous. That would never happen here!"" And then I realize. Are we at war with Oceana/East Asia? Or Iran/Iraq? The Patriot Act and Homeland Security can also be derivatives...what else did you find?"
1304,Camille,"So incredibly influential. This book scares me so much because as much as I like to think it is complete fiction that could never happen, every once in a while I see a news story and an Orwellian phrase will lurk into my mind...BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU. And when I watch C-Span (which I try to limit, really) I constantly think of Orwellian Doublethink (or Sorel's ""vital lie""). This changed the way I looked at any person or group that wants to control other people since I first read it in 7th grade, hence my crazy government paranoia."
1305,Gabriel L.,"In the beautifully crafted 1984, a novel by George Orwell, Winston Smith struggles in a lost battle with the controlling party that rules everything about his low-ranking life in the conquered city of London, Oceana. A society where mere thoughts which denounced the ruling party caused the punishment of death sets the gloomy, dark, and oppressive mood which comes with Winston’s dull life in his dim apartment. This sets up to reveal his job at the government ministries, where he is to re-write history in favor of the all-powerful leader; “Big Brother”. At work he meets an extremely attractive girl by the name of Julia who, despite its’ illegal nature, had sexual relations with. These acts are discovered by O’Brien, a high-ranking government official and he quickly reveals himself to be part of the “Brotherhood”, a union to rebel against the controlling government and inducts them as rebels. However, it’s revealed to the reader that O’Brien isn’t who we think he is; he is actually a government spy whose job was to catch Winston as a rebel. Eventually, he gives in to the pressure of the government and accepts his fate to be a slave to Big Brother.My favorite character in 1984 is the main character, Winston because he is a thorough thinker and his wisdom forgoes that of almost every other character that is controlled by the government in this dark time. He feels hopeless against the power of his leaders who will effectively re-write history in their own favor, “He who controls the past controls the future, and he who controls the present controls the past” (35). This really is an incredible bit of insight given as it tells us that we have the power to change the future, but we also have the power to change the past to what suits us, an act that Big Brother uses to bend his popularity and crush hopes of rebellion. Additionally, Winston is a character whom it’s extremely easy to sympathize with as he struggles so much internally with the fact that he will never be able to overthrow his leading power. He acknowledges that the damage Big Brother has done to his society is much too monumental to undo. “Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious,” (54) he writes into his journal to contain his increasingly disgusted attitude towards his leaders to whom he can’t directly defy. This is extremely significant because it shows that he knows rebellion is impossible, to rebel at this point is not even an option and he is to sit in this dull society for life. This can’t help but bring you to feel sympathy for such a sad and wizened character as Winston who will never again feel a free life since his vague memories as a small child.Overall, this book is masterfully crafted and it is clear that incredible bouts of thought were poured into its creation. Many books I’ve read use heavy details which describe the scene or characters, but it’s also very often that I am bored with the unnecessary details that it provides and 1984 almost never allows me to be bored with the details for one spectacular reason; all of the details provided give an incredible moral lesson and are important to story development. Each piece of unrelated dialogue adds a great deal of characterization to Winston and is incredibly clear and easily-interpreted. I personally was so inspired by the these lines within the book, that I jotted them down in order in order to make meaning of them and learn from Orwell’s obvious expertise on the topics which he writes about. Besides this, I have never in my lifetime taken any form of notes on a book that weren’t mandatory for an assignment. In all, 1984 is beautifully written and idea-filled book that everybody deserves an opportunity to read and learn from in their lifetime."
1306,Becca,"Oof. There is so much I missed on my first reading of this as a teenager. This book is often upheld as a sure bet for society's downfall. I realized that it is so much more sinister and familiar than that. Big Brother is not an evil dictator who can be overthrown; Big Brother is an ecosystem. Winston's knowledge of his fatefrom the first time he puts pen to paper is eery in its authenticity. The most familiar/eery part of the book rests in the concept of doublethink. We're all so confident in our versions of universal truth, even when faced with others who hold true to their own truth that is just as plausible. We love Big Brother.Sidenote: this edition has a forward by Thomas Pynchon. Highly recommended."
1307,Marina Safronova,"This is a very good book despite the fact that the moment I closed it I was so disappointed! During the first and second parts the author got my hopes high, but in the third part he crushed them with a war hammer (it certainly felt so))). Of course, this also happened because of a general idea of films and similar stories where the oppressed rise and rally towards freedom, and I expected such a turn. But, alas! ""He loved Big Brother"".I remembered Clarice Starling in the end of ""Hannibal Lecter"" - she got off lightly!When O'Brian asked Julia and Winston if they were ready to never see each other again for their cause, Julia said ""No!"", but Winston hesitated. I thought ""Ugh, men..."" But his loyalty and love for her lasted longer, and that says something. I need to correct my judgement)The Newspeak language is very interesting, I want to read the Russian version of the book to compare.Room 101 - significant number, because self-preservation is the first basic instinct of any living thing, and all moral and social factors aside - it is the human nature. We should not deceive ourselves.There are a lot of interesting thoughts. I certainly recommend to read this book."
1308,Sil.hamilton," Pretty good. Character development was not a very large part, but the connections between this hypothesized future, and today's world is mind-blowing.  Orwell managed to entirely predict North Korea, based on the books I've read from people who was born there, and some French animators. "
1309,Ginny,"This book killed any hope for humanity, but it was very well-written and accurate. You can see some of what he ""prophesied"" come true. Reading the book, you get a sense of despair about what he wants the world to be. He is no capitalist, but does not believe in communism. This book crushes any hope you have for the future. Humanity always suffers, always makes the same mistakes, cannot reach a happy medium, plans everything out diabolically, and festers in wisely concocted delusions. Thank you, pseudonym, for the warning, but now I fear you bred a spawn of conspiracy theorists."
1310,Monica,"I kept thinking about the way we write today. How we shorten words to mean what we say instead of typing them all out. This book reflects what's going on in our society, not just in terms of how language changes, but how we manipulate our history and how those in power choose to change what we view as true. "
1311,Víctor Sampayo,"La historia de Winston Smith es una alegoría en donde los arquetipos de los regímenes totalitarios desembocan en la más perfecta tiranía. Una en la cual se niega inclusive la existencia de los mártires, y por ende, la libertad del pensamiento desde sus propias raíces: el control del más insignificante ciudadano implica no sólo su supresión como persona, sino también, y acaso principalmente, el abandono total de las esperanzas y de las creencias individuales. El lenguaje, reducido hasta menos del hueso y depurado de ambigüedades, sólo puede acrecentar el poder del partido, y eso, a su vez, derivará en la perpetuidad de la tiranía. Un ejercicio infernal de cómo sería un mundo permanentemente controlado por una burocracia sin escrúpulos."
1312,Bayan,"every time I mention this book the word ""genius"" comes up in my mind.my mind cannot fully comprehend every single idea but I cannot ignore the fact that it absolutely changed the way I see the world.at the beginning I thought the author was exaggerating too much but then I realized he is describing real life with precise detail.I cannot begin to describe this book. Every time I try to write something it sounds stupid. So just go and read it. It's absolutely remarkable."
1313,Jeremi Doucet,"I think the book itself was great. The fact that it exploited the themes of totalitarianism and manipulation made for a very interesting and essential read. However, I think that although the message is great, the story line was lacking. The book served as a cautionary tale which he tried to integrate into the life of Winston and Julia. Through this simple plot, Orwell explains in explicit detail every aspect of the society in order for us to truly understand it. Nevertheless, the story of Winston wasn't necessarily interesting. What kept the reader going was the way in which every detail of the society was slowly revealed. The role of Winston was simply to give his opinions on society which we can relate to because like him we see it as completely extreme. Therefore, I gave the book 5 stars because I think this was the best way for Orwell to pass on his views of society and warn us of the dangers of totalitarianism."
1314,Wardegus,This book changed my life. I read it in high school and I've never trusted government since. 
1315,Knucklefish,"How much do I love this book? So much!Interestingly, I followed up this, the classic tale of a future dystopia, with Ender's Shadow, a more current prediction for the future. Not that they lacked parallels. Oh, but Orwell is such a master of the futuristic cautionary tale that this book defies the title of science fiction. I mean, ever heard of Big Brother? Orwell defined the concept!Okay, I'll try to be a bit more articulate. The first two parts of the book were pitch perfect. Orwell paints a vivid picture, then lets us watch as Winston and Julia get a taste of the freedom they are being denied. I understand why they had to be caught in part three. It puts the caution in cautionary tale. The only detail I would change is the very end when Winston is truly brainwashed. The Party conquers his thought, and he loves Big Brother. I would want to leave readers with the idea that their minds are the one thing they can always keep for themselves. Then again, the disturbing ending might be part of the book's power. Orwell, I bow to your genius."
1316,Avalon,"There is a shocking resemblance between George Orwell's 1984 and our society today. In 1984 we saw many instances where Big Brother was slowly dumbing down the knowledge, memory and language of the society. These instances are seen in reality with common core and the lack of vocabulary in the current generation. Also an eerie correlation between the present technology and the feeling of being watched as if Big Brother is slowly creeping into our lives without fanfare or protest. 1984 was a thoroughly captivating book. Definitely a great read."
1317,Jenifer Wehmeyer,"I can't believe I didn't read this earlier in my life. WOW! However, maybe my appreciate is only because I am older and more interested in the world and how it works. My deepest thoughts as a 16 year old was how to get the attention of a boy I liked or some other pedestrian, pubescent worry. As a teacher, I see that This book would be great to use in a study of oppressive governments. "

1319,Scott,"War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength.What is there to say about this famous book other than you have to read it? I feel like every year when I hear about this book mentioned, someone makes the comment that it is as relevant as ever. I'm not sure how that's the case, but it really is true, every year. Orwell's genius shines through as his vivid images of Oceania conjure up feelings inside your head that make you feel as if you're walking alongside Winston through the slums, into his hiding spots, and especially all through his movements in the last third of the book. Oceania's presence feels as real as anything else I can think of, and if it feels so real in the mind, is it not real after all? Orwell especially succeeds in creating a terrifying universe, while at the same time somehow being oddly comforting in the brutally honest description of the Party's intentions and heinous visions.I read an eBook edition with an introduction by Thomas Pynchon, author of Gravity's Rainbow, and appreciated his insight into the themes and context of Orwell's writing. I especially liked his theory that Winston is meant to represent Orwell's son, who had recently been born at the time of writing, with the idea that this was the world Orwell was afraid his son was going to be living in soon. Was he right in his predictions? Thankfully, not completely, I hope...Either way, Orwell is clearly a master of writing. If you haven't read this book and for some reason you're reading my review to find out if you should: you should. Even though it gets said again and again, I still feel obligated to say...the book is so relevant now more than ever. Not to mention that it's an extraordinary literary accomplishment. "
1320,Tony Calder,"It has been many years since I last read this, having read it in high school and then again in my twenties. It is still an excellent book, and one of the more chilling dystopian books, although the likelihood of it being a possible future seems much more remote than when I previously read it over 35 years ago.Many of the methods used by the Party will seem familiar to modern readers - media manipulation of the public, occasional outright denial of facts by political and business leaders - especially to those in Australia who have just lived through two years of a government that seemed determined to reshape the country in their image. However, while the book never really gives an explanation of exactly how Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia came to be (and it's not really that important), it seems unlikely these days that three totalitarian governments would be able to gain such power.Orwell was clearly in a dark place when he wrote this, with much of Europe having suffered nearly a decade of conflict between the Spanish Civil War and World War II, and the complete lack of hope throughout the book can be oppressive.Still, this is an excellent book, one that everyone should read at least once in their lives."
1321,Marzieh,جورج اورول توی این رمان جامعه ای رو توصیف میکنه که در اون مردم از دشمن به شدت متنفرن و رهبرشون رو مثل یک موجود نیمه خدایی میپرستن. توی این جامعه مردم به سه دسته ی قوی، متوسط و ضعیف تقسیم میشن؛ تمام قدرت و ثروت در دست دسته ی قویه و بقیه مردم انقدر برای امرار معاش تلاش میکنن که حتی وقت ندارن به این موضوع فکر کنن که مورد ظلم واقع شده ن. افکار و اعمال مردم تحت نظارت حزب قرار داره و کسی جرات نداره که به چیزی برخلاف خواسته های حزب حتی فکر کنه، چون با اینکه هیچ قانون کتبی در این مورد وجود نداره ولی هرکس که برخلاف حزب کاری انجام بده و یا قصد انجامشو داشته باشه به سادگی سر به نیست میشه. جایی که آزادی های فردی در اون پایمال میشه، مفهوم خانواده از بین رفته و خانواده فقط برای تولید مثل تشکیل میشه و روابط عاشقانه در اون جایی نداره.. جایی که در اون تاریخ، کتابها و اخبار رو تحریف میکنن و به دلخواه خودشون اونارو تغییر میدن. از اعتقادات مردم و مذهب سوء استفاده میکنن تا سرگرم بشن و نفهمن که بهشون ظلم میشه.جنگ ها پایانی ندارن و به پیروزی یا شکست ختم نمیشن، بلکه راهی هستن برای مصرف ثروت و تولید ملی؛ به این منظور که همواره قدرت رو در دست داشته باشن.موقع خوندن این کتاب حتی یک لحظه نمیشه از مقایسه شباهت های شرایط تخیلی کتاب و شرایط حال حاضر جهان دست برداشت. پیش بینی اورول واقعا شاهکاره!
1322,Anilla,"Orwell, una vez más, me da una probada de su genialidad a la hora de hablar, alegóricamente, sobre temas políticos.1984 explora la posibilidad y la facilidad en la que el poder puede exterminar el pensamiento y promover el manejo de masas.Excelente y altamente recomendado."
1323,Laila,"What did I think? What do I think.Well. I should have known that the story was going to take such a dark, cynical turn, after reading Animal Farm. But I'm a fluffy 'dreams are revolutions' kind of kid, so obviously I expected Julia and Winston to join the Brotherhood, and the reign of Big Brother would come to a dramatic end, with the People standing over the smoking ruins of the system like traditional conquerors, staring into the sunset...While no perfect new system would be in play, the future would be theirs...I should have known.It was such a powerful story, wasn't it? The two ideas that struck me the most were the concept of Newspeak, and the alteration of the past. Limiting ways to express yourself so that certain feelings and ideas couldn't exist anymore, and how nothing is really static and we take so much news for granted... The power of words and all that jazz... This book has left me terrified, paranoid, and haunted. Completely serious stuff.I take one star off for the 'romance' between Winston and Julia. I just... I know it's supposed to be more political than anything, but it's just so hard... to take in... a romance without schmaltziness... It's supposed to be warm and fuzzy!!!...DAMN. I can't take that star off. It makes sense. WHYYY, ORWELL, WHYYY? -_-'"
1324,Phil,"This book was, for me, extremely engaging. As I read about all the elements and implications of this time period, I was both horrified and fascinated at the same time by the aspects and ideas that are presented in this particular society. The setting as a whole is extremely engaging, and the messages that are portrayed are a great exercise of the mind. Winston Smith, Julia, and O'Brien really put me on a roller-coaster ride of emotions through their actions, decisions, and what they need to put up with throughout the book. In this sense, I quite like them as characters. I had very few gripes with reading it; ""the book"" that Winston reads was rather dull and I felt I was reading more of a political essay rather than a novel. I also found Winston to be particularly annoying around part three. In the end, I would absolutely recommend to anybody who is easing themselves into the classic novels, especially in the dystopian future category. The book really catches the readers attention especially with the structure of the environment and on the mechanics of this totalitarian government of 1984. "
1325,Alex,"Second addition to my bookshelf, because this is the best book I've read in years. Julie has been harping on me to read it, so I picked it up for the China trip... how very appropriate.So often lumped in with ""Brave New World"" as the pinnacle of early 20th century dystopian prophecy. In the spirit of Beatles-vs.-Elvis, I'll say that I much prefer ""1984.""I see no sense in trying to summarize or review the book, so I'll just share some of the more profound impressions that I felt while reading it.For starters, the disturbing amount of seemingly familiar motifs, phrases, and ideas in the book caught me off-guard. While reading ""1984,"" though possibly due in part to immediacy, I was hard-pressed to think of any work of fiction that has been so consistently aped, imitated, or unconciously evoked in subsequent film and literature. 1984 is everywhere... from Big Brother to ""Brazil""-ian bureaucracy to blind sloganeering (let's play Word-or-Not? with that one).I expected to find Orwell's writing a bit dry, anachronistic, and difficult to relate to. Could NOT have been more wrong. The prose is remarkably savvy and accessible. All of the stylistic hurdles that I typically find I must bridge when reading fiction from a different era were surprisingly absent. The book ""reads"" like it could have been written yesterday. And I mean that in a good way.Also, I'm not trying to break on older books... I'm just saying that the evolution of the English language can very often throw up communication barriers when reading novels from a bygone era. Not so with this book.In the case of 1984, ""prophetic"" would be an understatement. The accuracy of 1984's assumptions about modern and recently modern society evoke an inescapable gravity. For a book written about the future, it feels remarkably familiar and immediate... and, even though a fantasy, 1984's relevance borders on timeless and universal.I'll dispense with the hyperbole. You know this book, and you know you're supposed to have read it. But we're not talking about fucking ""Pride and Prejudice"" here, where you can acknowledge that everyone thinks it's a classic, while still avoiding it because you know it sucks. This book is far too frightening and far too relevant. If you haven't read this book, then please make it a future ""must-read."" Mark my words: it will blow you away."

1330,Marjola,"This is my favorite book. Amazing. When I started reading it,I didn't have a clue what it was about. It is frightening how something written in 1948 for a future 1984 became a reality for many Eastern Europian countries. And what makes it even more frightening is how you can see parts of it even in today's society.'Do not imagine that you will save yourself, Winston, however completely you surrender to us. No one who has once gone astray is ever spared. And even if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life, still you would never escape from us. What happens to you here is for ever. Understand that in advance. We shall crush you down to the point from which there is no coming back. Things will happen to you from which youcould not recover, if you lived a thousand years. Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you. Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.'"

1333,Nadia Nabillah,"Reading this book was like finding out all the crazy conspiracy theories you have ever heard of WAS true in a different life (IN THE FUTURE?). I love this book because its concept was larger than life, but still very in touch with reality."
1334,Judyta Szaciłło,"The book is well-written, evocative, and insightful. It shows vivid images, and it shares raw emotions. It demonstrates deep understanding of a number of human attitudes and existential issues. It's been a page-turner to me, but I do not share in the general feeling of fear expressed by many other readers, nor do I find the dystopian picture a convincing threat. Winston, the main character of a very sharp mind, at times fails to understand implications that seem obvious even from his perspective - like when he talks with 'the proles' about the old times, and, despite his usual wit, he fails to understand the information conveyed in their accounts. The whole concept of Newspeak disregards the inherent quality of every language to evolve spontaneously and beyond any control in any group of humans, whether they are family, neighbours, or co-workers. ""The proles"" are shown on one side as having been left to their own devices, and on the other as being successfully cleansed of all dangerous element, which is not plausible, especially in the population of 300 million. ""1984"" is a great and skillfully written story, but there's no prophetic quality to it, which I have come to expect after hearing so much about it. The vision of the world under the governance of the Party is interesting, but too detached from the reality to be scary."
1335,Florence Liu,"I added this book to my ""to-read"" shelf a long time ago and kept meaning to read it, without ever making the time to pick it up at the library. Finally after much persuasion from my dad (and various other parties) I decided to finally make a move - one that I probably won't ever regret. This book was amazing. I started off expecting to read a couple of chapters - no more than 50 pages at the most. Turns out I read 200 pages in my first sitting. This book looks intimidating but is not. Would recommend to anyone and everyone... this is something that you should read in an afternoon and remember for a lifetime. "
1336,Truongmai,"""WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH ""-George OrwellI got into Orwell's works after reading Animal Farm as part of a class assignment. Listening to my teacher's recommendation, I began reading 1984. Never would I have known that this would be my favorite novel. 1984 is a scarily grotesque yet realistic depiction of what the world would be like under totalitarian control. Set in a totalitarian superstate of Oceania, the audiences are introduced to the lives of its suffering citizens. Monitored at all time by telescreens, any acts of disobedience are recorded and punished. Rations of inedible food are passed around. The news changes according to the Party's belief. And the worst of all, Big Brother is always watching. "
1337,Missy Profesora,"1984 was, as other reviewers have said, heavy handed, but still excellent. I do not agree that the characters are bland or that we don't care about them; I cared very much!Animal Farm was a lot better though.And my Fav Orwell is Down and Out in Paris and London, which is an essay - and a very long essay...What causes me to view 1984 with unique fondness though, was that a bunch of science fiction writers got together and published, in 1984, 1984 Re-visited - each writer's ""take"" on 1984, the novel.So long as I breathe, I shall remember fondly the story which began "".... looked around his grey little room, with its grey little walls, grey little.... and the grey little blonde beside him. ""Come OFF IT Big Brother"" screamed the Headline. Winston knew that this was not the story the government hacks had handed out, but no disciplinary action could be taken, for the printers always blamed the shortage of typeface, claiming that they could only make words from the letters available"" I laughed until I cried. And y'know, I have lost count of how many times I've told that type-setting joke verbatim - and NOT ONE person I told it to ever got it. "

The same Chinese language is a kind of Newspeak: there is the word good but not bad because no-good is enough.Unfortunately, ignorance really is strength and nowadays there is a different kind of brain washing with overconsumption and a 24h Telescreen of stupidity.

1349,Ella,"This book changes you, and it changes your way of looking at things."
1350,Lazar Vaynshteyn," In 1984 by George Orwell, the storyline is complex. Basically, the year is 1984(Supposedly) and London is just a former shell of it’s old self. The world is divided into 3 major continents, Eurasia, Oceania, Eastasia. The protagonist of 1984 is Winston Smith, a forty-something year old man who works for the party, the governing dictators of London. All of London has to bow down to the famed leader of the party, “Big Brother”, who may or may not be even real, as the Party is infamous for censorship and altering history. Winston’s every action is watched by the party through the Telescreens all around his home and the city. The story begins with his affair with a woman named Julia. Winston’s frustration with the party leads him to commit “thoughtcrimes”, which were punishable by death. Through a series of plot twists Winston ends up a completely different person from the beginning of the novel. Through these plot events, the reader sees Orwell’s message of the dangers of totalitarianism in a country. We understand this theme through the entire novel with the actions of the party. An important quote that reinforces the theme of the dangers of totalitarianism is “He loved Big Brother”. This is significant in that the government had managed to change the way in which Winston acted and thought, which was one of the powers of a totalitarian government.	For me, this book was an eye opener into the style of government of past. I am thankful for the time and government I live with now, though it may be moving in the wrong direction. It is eerie how many things Orwell had predicted would exist in the future, like televisions and nuclear weapons. This proves that we humans have the foresight to see things like this happening in the future and that we have the power to prevent it from happening.		It is definitely worth reading 1984 as it is not only an extremely good story , but also the fact that it’s message is clear as day and how relevant in our society it is see bad things in our lives and work to change it for the better. "
1351,Courtney Whittamore- The Moral of our Stories,"I remember this being an assigned reading book in my junior year of high school. I was never one to like to be told what to do, so had I picked this book out on my own I probably would have really enjoyed it from the start as it falls in direct line with the style of writing that I enjoy, but making it required made it distasteful to me. However I read the book because I always completed my assignments whether I wanted to or not, but once I got through about two thirds of the way through with the book, I read three simple lines that made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. It's in the tenth chapter of the second part where Winston and Julia have just finished making love in their secret apartment. I did not find anything interesting in this scene because to me it was just like two teenagers sneaking around behind their parent's back. This is something that was the topic of conversation at every table in the cafeteria no matter the clique of kids the table happened to occupy. But then there were these words:""'We are the dead.' he said.'We are the dead,' echoed Julia dutifully.You are the dead.' said an iron voice behind them."" I vividly remember sitting back down on the edge of my bed and letting out a ""Whoa"" and suddenly becoming very interested in the book. I then chuckled at the next like that said ""Winston's entrails seemed to have turned to ice."" The combination of the hilarity of frozen entrails and the creepy iron voice telling them they were dead from behind a picture frame demanded of me to start the book over.While the beginning seemed to lag to me, and there is a lot of repetition about policy and the monotony of life, I was really jarred that this very well could be a depiction of the types of censorship we could experience in the future. And the just weeks ago it feels like Big Brother materialized from the pages of Orwell's book and into the mainstream media in the form of the new Facebook messenger. I am sure apps like this have existed since all of our technology has begun to advance, but this one has been chosen as the poster child. Maybe Big Brother has decided it is time to start watching us, or maybe still, just like with Winston and Julia, Big Brother has been watching all along, he was just always hiding underneath the other side of our screen. Pretty crazy that they chose to have the voice come out from behind a screen isn't it? Since it seems we all live our lives in front of or hid behind screens at all times these days. Just something to think about.This book changed the idea of forward creativity for me, and without it I don't think I would be as intrigued in the development of new creative frontiers as I am for having read this. 1984 very easily may have been what started it all for me, and I am so very grateful."
1352,Issam Benqassou,2+2=5اذا اردت معرفة كيف يكتب العباقرة فاقرا 1984ليست رواية عادية بل تحفة من التحف النادرة  في خضم الرواية ستجد في أغلب الأحيان أنك تعيش بشكل من الأشكال ما عاشه ونسطون في دولة مثل أوراسيا حيث يتمتع الحزب الحاكم بصلاحية الحكم المطلق ، إن اردت العيش تحت حكم دولة مماثلة فكن من القطيع ولا تستخدم عقلك ابدا فحتى الحرب ان كانت البارحة مع دولة اوقيانيا واستفقت الصباح لتجدها دولة صديقة ولم يكن لنا معها حرب ولا عداوة فذلك صحيح، ولا تسأل لماذا ولا تشكك في ذلك ، ان كان لون الحائط ابيضا وتراه الدولة اسودا فلا تفعل ما فعله وينستون برفضه لذلك، لا تحاول حتى في التفكير وتحليل ذلك في عقلك فحتى ملامحك ان كشف فيها شيئ من عدم الولاء والحب للاخ الاكبر ، فهذا الاخير يراقبك ، هي دولة بحكم مطلق ووجب على رعاعها الانصياع لحكم الاخ الاكبر بشكل مطلق من كل هذا كن بليدا لتعيش في اوراسيا فعملية حسابية ك 2+2=5 صحيحة منطقيا ورياضياتيا وبكل الاشكال إن كان الحزب يريدها كذلك،رواية غابت فيها جميع اشكل الاحاسيس فشخصياتها ليست لديها أحاسيس إلا الكراهية تجاه شيء يكرهه الحزب، كل إحساس جميل قد يولد في شخص ما يتم وأده قبل ولادته، الأحاسيس في الرواية تركها الكاتب للقراء، قد يسعد القارئ قليلا في العلاقة التي تمرد وينستون وجوليا لجعلها تحيا، لكنه سيغضب كثيرا ويصاب بازدواجية الفكر كثيرا ويشمئز في غالبية الثلث الأخير، لكن احساس الصدمة قد ترك للقارئ في الجملة الاخيرة من الرواية، فعلا حبست انفاسي آخر جملة .مؤلم جدا ما حدث لونستون بطل الرواية،،فذكاؤه وبحثه عن تغيير شيء في الدولة كان بعيدا عن متناوله بسنوات ضوئية ،قد لا أستطيع التوقف عن التكلم والتحليل في الرواية لذلك سأنهي مراجعتي لهابكل بساطة كما وجدت في ريڢيو Mohammed Arabey 1984 روايه تسابق الزمن كي تنهي عذابك معها..وتفكر في نفس الوقت متي ستقرأها مره ثانيه

1356,Thiago Costa,"1984 is the best 20th century book that I read until this moment.In 2013 I am experiencing in many ways all that Orwell write in 1984.Although of this amazing warning, the humankind continues regressing to a state that only have fear and obey to a State is the major law. It's not like the dictatorship, it's not a person that wants to rule the world, it's a State that wants to rule the people, with fear.The manipulated media is also a true that exists until today, to benefits the State and let the people blind to the real happens in our World."
1357,Mahmoud Tantawy,"shocked, and disappointed.disappointed not in the novel, nor the author, but it is that disappointment you have when you see your world in the novel and you hope that it ends well because that would give you hope for a better ending to your own world, but it doesn't end well, and that's the point.But, at the end of the day, i realize the disappointment is due to the view of the novel that there is no GOD, no after life, and that winning in life is the ultimate winning, which does NOT align with my beliefs, so it feels better after modifying the novel to match one's beliefs.Finally, i'll mention one of my favorite versus of Qur'an بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمنِ الرَّحِيمِ{وَلاَ تَيْأَسُواْ مِن رَّوْحِ اللّهِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يَيْأَسُ مِن رَّوْحِ اللّهِ إِلاَّ الْقَوْمُ الْكَافِرُونَ } صدق الله العظيميوسف87سورة يوسف "

Considering it was written in 1948 given how far technology has come if anything it makes 1984 more believable in how easily this could happen. I'd not read this for a number of years and like a lot of the books read during school and college years it was made a lot better by not having to pause to analyse every sentence and discuss Orwell's thought processes and meanings but be prepared for the book to make you stop and reflect."

1368,Carly,"This book, every time I read it, only gets better.I am captivated by Winston's choices (some of which are terrible and stupid). But I am, everytime, crushed by the end. Reading about Big Brother, censorship, undying loyalty to the Party sadly reminds me too much of our own society. Specifically, I think to post-9/11, when the government was able to lock up citizens and non citizens for as long as they wanted, without the right to a lawyer or judge, just locked up. I think of US citizens who were encouraged to report ""suspicious"" behavior and actions of their neighbors. I think of citizens and celebrities who, if they dared speak against the war, were astrocized and labeled unpatriotic. Reading this book makes me sad for our society. It makes me wish we were better than we are. SPOILER:Every time I read this, I am absolutely devastated that he is captured, that he is tortured and gives everything and everyone up. I am haunted by the last words in the book, ""I love Big Brother"".This is one of the first dystopia books I ever read, and unlike some, it ends with such a lack of hope that the reader is left feeling that the current situations of the people will never be altered. This sense of hopelessness is one that leaves the reader chilled--which is what I think was the desired purposed."

1370,Bonnie," Nineteen Eighty-Four is a book that completely destroys the reader’s perception of what a good book should be like. All other books previously deemed ‘good’ seem dull and cliché in comparison. Nineteen Eighty-Four is a dystopian novel set in, predictably, 1984 and written by George Orwell. Unlike recently popular dystopian novels The Hunger Games and Divergent, Nineteen Eighty-Four was not written with a younger audience in mind. Nevertheless, anyone can appreciate this brilliantly written masterpiece to the fullest extent for its relatable characters, wonderful plot, unusual writing style, and intriguing setting. 	Nineteen Eighty-Four begins with the protagonist, Winston Smith, going about his daily routine. The reader is introduced to a dystopian world of telescreens—a means of constant government surveillance—Thought Police, and the all-seeing eye of Big Brother, the leader of the Party. Winston lives in London, the “chief city of Airstrip One” (5). Airstrip One is a province of Oceania—one of the 3 superstates—the others being Eurasia and Eastasia. Winston, being a Party member, works at the Ministry of Truth, the other 3 Ministries being the Ministry of Peace, the Ministry of Love, and the Ministry of Plenty. Curiously enough, the Ministry of Truth spreads lies in its newspaper, the Ministry of Peace oversees the war with Eurasia, the Ministry of Love holds prisoners, and the Ministry of Plenty reduces the rations frequently. Winston himself spends every day changing newspaper articles to reflect reality—or whatever is claimed to be true. The reader is thus shown a dreary world of 3 totalitarian superstates engaged in a never-ending war, where freedom is a soon to be forgotten concept, and where even thoughts against the ruling Party is a crime punishable by death. Horrifyingly enough, most of the population follows Big Brother and the Party out of blind loyalty. Winston, however, secretly hates the Party and defies them numerous times. He visits the proletarian area (proles being the lower class and thus Party members are not allowed to associate with them) and also writes in an old diary denouncing Big Brother. He takes it further by starting an illegal relationship with Julia, as both love and attraction are strongly discouraged by the Party and celibacy encouraged. As their relationship progresses, Winston and Julia share their traitorous thoughts with each other. However, they know that it is pointless to resist until one day, they are approached by someone from the Brotherhood, a resistance movement against the Party. From there on, Winston and Julia pledge to help spread the Brotherhood’s message. However, their journey is full of obstacles. Will the Brotherhood succeed in their revolution, or were they doomed from the start?	The characters in Nineteen Eighty-Four are completely the opposite of what the reader expects, and that is exactly what makes them so realistic. Whom Winston believes to be a Party zealot and whom he believes to be a rebel switch places; he erroneously judges them. Even Winston himself, the protagonist, becomes disillusioned with his beliefs. This is completely realistic and quite common in real life. Not everyone, unlike the traditional hero, changes the world around them to cater to their beliefs. Realistically, many people do not have the will to go against the world, and Winston reflects the many people who accept the stronger will imposed on them, in the end.	The plot is quite realistic as well, but also absolutely captivating with a shocking plot twist. When people think of dystopian novels, The Hunger Games comes into mind—an oppressive regime, widespread hatred, people flocking to join revolutionary movements, and, finally, the overthrowing of the regime as the revolution reaches its peak—but Nineteen Eighty-Four is quite different from the popular dystopian novels today, and thus employs a much more unpredictable plot with less action. There weren't all that many subplots save for a few flashbacks to Winston’s childhood. Overall, the plot is actually relatively straightforward and simple, but still interesting even with a slight lack of action compared to typical dystopian novels.	The writing style in Nineteen Eighty-Four is markedly different from many novels, and definitely not what a reader would expect. Foreshadowing, a very common element in most novels, is almost conspicuously lacking in Nineteen Eighty-Four. This, however, does a very good job of lulling the reader into a deceptively calm mindset until the plot twist is unleashed upon the reader. Additionally, there are fewer action scenes than what the reader would expect, as previously noted. Instead, the author settles the conflict in subtler ways—mainly, explaining in detail how the conflicting beliefs of Wilson and the Party are resolved. As for diction, Nineteen Eighty-Four was written in 1948, where such language would have been commonplace and not considered ‘sophisticated’. In fact, Nineteen Eighty-Four can be quite blunt at times, but also gives off a queer sense of detachment. It is these aspects, of a lack of foreshadowing and physical action scenes, and of blunt language with hidden meanings, that make the writing style of Nineteen Eighty-Four wildly different from any in its category. 	The setting and notions stated in Nineteen Eighty-Four are arguably the highlights of the book, as they are incredibly interesting. The world created by George Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four is a work of creative genius. At first glance, many things seem to follow the work of previous, real-life dictators. However, as it is a fictional novel, it is the fictional aspects that are the most fascinating. For example, the fact that Big Brother may not be a real person is a most intriguing aspect, as is the fact that an overwhelming majority of population is blissfully unaware of the oppressive methods used by the Party. The concepts of doublethink and Newspeak, however, are the most riveting. That the author makes it seem like the power to control reality is plausible is a testament to the genius of the author. In other words, the creations of doublethink, Newspeak, thoughtcrime, crimestop, and many other ideas presented in Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell are what make the book amazingly awe-inspiring. 	Nineteen Eighty-Four is a book that will blow all other books away by the sheer brilliance of it. The characters are realistic, the plot full of twists, the writing style uncommon and the setting and themes endlessly fascinating. This book is the complete opposite of what the reader would expect a typical book to be like, and that makes it almost ironic, to the point of being darkly humorous. In this day and age where some people believe Twilight is wildly popular because of merit, Nineteen Eighty-Four deserves more than just 5 stars and a glowing recommendation. It deserves readership—even if it does take a government surveillance scandal to get it. "
1371,Kathryn,"This is almost a frightening story. Written in 1950, the prophetic, futuristic ideas are just so amazing. This is a class book you won't forget, and must read. "
1372,Catarina,"Magistral e abjectamente desolador do início ao fim. Mesmo os seus raros e curtos momentos de alguma felicidade,se lhe podemos chamar assim,estão intrinsecamente manchados pelo horror que lhes antecedeu e pelo horror que lhes seguirá. São como o pisa-papéis aí descrito,uma miragem de beleza numa redoma frágil e rara,que num sopro,é brutalmente estilhaçado. Mais do que uma viagem literária, 1984 é um pungente e atemorizante ensaio sobre a humanidade. Nele condensa a herança da evolução e do progresso,do trauma das duas Grandes Guerras, da ameaça e dos efeitos dos totalitarismos,da maldade e corrupção face ao poder. É um retrato trágico e extremo, mas em certa medida quase assustadoramente profético, e se não um desabafo,um aviso grave e convulsivo ao futuro. ""O Grande Irmão está a vigiar-vos."" , a verdade que assombra Winston Smith, é a engenhosa e perversa supremacia de controlo sob os seus cidadãos. Se tudo é visto e analisado,como se pode ser livre? Se nem a ideia nem o pensamento persistem num espaço privado do indivíduo,como pode este ser livre? Se os seus actos e ideias são copiosamente formatados em inconsciência e ortodoxia desde o berço, como se pode ser livre? A descrição do ""como"" é agonizante e temível,principalmente pela lassidão e subserviência da generalidade dos elementos do Partido Externo;a revelação do porquê,embora não totalmente surpreendente, é deveras miserável. Orwell é notável e contudente e imperdoável na construção desta distopia;não existe verdadeiramente esperança. A máquina do poder é omnipresente e omnipotente e o seu trunfo vasto: o contínuo reescrever do passado,a perpetualização da guerra,o obliterar do pensamento livre,da emoção do belo e do admirável, da convulsão do amor e do prazer,sucedem copiosamente no propósito de degradar a humanidade à servidão,à ignorância,ao conformismo, à adoração cega e inflamada da própria propaganda que os destruiu. Leiam 1984 e reflictam. Voltem a lê-lo e reflictam novamente. É o que eu irei fazer. Mesmo com aquele final insuportavelmente desolador. Haverá melhor manifesto que este para estar consciente,vigilante e informado? "" Liberdade é a liberdade de escrever que dois e dois são quatro."" (muitas outras me ficaram..mas penso que esta citação traduz de forma até curiosa parte da mensagem do livro)"
1373,Susan Choi,"I don't care about politics nor do matters regarding censorship, privacy, and the general deterioration of the American psyche interest me. Regardless, a good dystopian novel makes me happy. I also love offbeat, unexpected romance! The kind that makes you gasp and giggle in your chair amidst a sea of all the placidly impoverished and deprived people not reading what you are. Socio-political issues, although important (I guess), especially if rendered with a hefty thrust from a dusty pulpit, are not fun to read about. Try as I might, my taste in books remains largely shallow and exhibits a pattern that is markedly one dimensional. Yet luckily, on many occasions, my preferences for the undeniably ancillary aspects of books are eclipsed by the more stately tastes of wiser readers in pursuit of genuine literary/artistic fulfilment and I can pretend that I liked 1984 because I am truly concerned about our shrinking privacy rights and am disgusted by everyone's vapid acceptance of media spiel. Really though, the totally unanticipated ""I love you"" note slipped into Winston's hand, is what compelled me to like 1984. George Orwell's writing is often labeled mediocre and although I don't agree, I believe a good story can redeem anything and this novel boasts a great one. "
1374,Carlo,"Celebrity Deathmatch Review: 1984 vs. The Annotated AliceAlice was sitting next to her sister, who was absent-mindedly gazing to the ground. They were sitting on a huge rock, in a drab and gloomy place once known as Hyde Park.“What are you staring at?” asked Alice abruptly.“Staring? What is ‘staring’?” asked her sister without moving her gaze. “Staring means looking continuously at something without moving your eyes away, just like what you are doing now,” said Alice. “What is ‘means’? What is 'continuously'? Why are you talking ungood again?” said her sister reproachfully. “When last year father was talking like this, I told the thought police about him. They took him away for a long time and when he came back, he was talking doubleplusgood. Do you want me to tell them about you?”“No, no. I don’t want to go away. I was just asking what you were looking at” said Alice fearfully.Her sister didn't reply and seemed not paying attention to her. Once, when Alice was on her way home, she stumbled upon a very old blue book upon which was written ""Oxford Concise Dictionary"" in big letters. She took the book home and showed it to her father. The latter seemed very interested in it and kept it hidden inside one of the old unused pillows. He told her not to tell anyone about it, and when she asked him why, he told her a silly story which Alice can't even remember now. Only Alice and her father knew about it and she used to look up words every couple of days, which her father taught her to do.Sitting in the gloomy place, Alice felt very bored and started looking around. Some ten yards away she saw a huge brown rat, which was moving its mouth and seemed to be making some noise. When Alice came near it, she heard it saying: “I’m late. I must hurry!” These words were very familiar to Alice. When the rat began running and went behind a huge rock, Alice followed it and as she reached the place, she saw a dining table on which dozens of ugly rats were eating and drinking while chatting very loudly.“Long live Big Brother” said one of the rats suddenly, raising its glass of Victory gin. When the others heard this, they all raised their glasses and shouted at once: “long live Big Brother.”Alice scowled. She used to hear these words at school for several times each day. She hated them. Every time she had managed to start a conversation with a friend about toys, candies, or Imaginary places, the teacher used to shout “Long Live Big Brother,” and they had to repeat the words after her. One of the rats, who seemed to be taking interest in Alice, came near her. “Hello my child. What are you doing here?” said the rat with a familiar tone.“Hello. I followed the brown rat,"" said Alice. ""I once dreamed of a talking white rabbit, which I followed into a very beautiful and curious place. There, I used to grow and shrink in size, and saw talking animals which played games with me. There were even rats there, but not as ugly as you_” she regretted the last sentence, but the rat didn't seem to pay attention to it. “And?” said the rat.“And that’s it. It was a very nice place. Much more beautiful than here,"" said Alice with a frown.“Hmm. Now tell me about the way you speak my dear” said the rat, with a malicious grin.Alice suddenly realized that she was inadvertently using words from the dictionary, and the rat understood them. She remembered that every time she accidentally used words from it with a friend or a family member (her father told her not to do so), they didn't understand what she was saying.“Tell me my dear,"" repeated the rat, ""how do you know so many words?”She tried to think about an answer, when the rat suddenly took out its hand, which was holding the very dictionary, from its pocket.“Is this the reason?” said the rat pointing to the dictionary.Alice didn't understand what was happening and how the rat had the dictionary. She suddenly realized that dozens of rats were rushing towards her and began taking her away. She started crying and tried to free herself, asking them to be taken back to her sister, but no one paid attention to her. All the rats disappeared except the one with the dictionary and another fat and extremely ugly one. Both took off their disguise and turned out to be members of the thought police. “Good job comrade” said the fat man, who seemed to be the chief. “Let me know your name once more.”“Smith, Winston Smith” said the man, who was now burning the dictionary with the same malicious grin.Matchpoint: 1984"
1375,Jason Salas,"Dystopian future at it's finest/worst. I was surprised at the pessimism of this book. Yet, that pessimism is fitting. I'm used to the YA dystopian books of late -- where the hero is the hero. This book is so negative that one might argue that there is no hero and, in arguing that point, that a future so bleak is devoid of heroes. But again, that may be the point.There are parts of the book that seem way off in terms of prophesy and other parts that are spot on. I doubt it was written as a prophetic book but rather a cautionary tale to raise awareness of what might become of us if we do not pay attention."

1379,Gulnar Patel,"In 1984 George Orwell depicts a dystopia like no other. It's a world that is discomfortingly stifling, where people are constantly observed, judged, and controlled. It's a society where private loyalties between friends and family are destroyed,thought is interfered with, and our basest instincts for power reign supreme. I found 1984 terrifying! What is so scary about the Party in 1984 is not its physical control over people, but the way it interferes in the realm of thought. It tries to create its own truth. Orwell's words are bare and meaningful, and his main character's heroism and vulnerability are deeply moving. This book is a book for any society, any time, any person. Highly recommended! "
1380,Nicolas Nuckell,"1984 es una obra maestra del género distópico, así de plano, disfrutar ahora por gusto su lectura 15 años después de haberla leído por primera vez y de forma menos interrumpida fue una experiencia a ratos terrorífica, en particular la descripción inicial de la ""Airstrip One"" y luego con las torturas, las cuales leídas en una sola ""sentada"" las hacen tan envolventes, tan veraces que aterran, Orwell transmite las sensaciones de manera magnífica, haciendo que a ratos quieras renunciar a la lectura, el discurso de O'Brien te deprime, genera terror.Inicialmente basada en la URSS de Stalin, 1984 describe un mundo que en muchos aspectos simpatiza con el actual, cada día somos más vigilados, las noticias son manipuladas, existe una agenda de temas que hay que poner en la palestra para generar emociones en la población (educación, delincuencia, inminentes crisis, etc.), la forma de vida de las clases sociales, el partido disfrutando la vida de siempre, el partido externo contenido, estresado, pero miedoso y sumiso, incapaz de rebelarse, y por último los proles, rebeldes, iracundos, pero incapaces de organizarse y derrocar el régimen, fiel reflejo de nuestros días. En este mundo la prole constituye la única esperanza de cambiar el destino, pero nunca lo harán, y si lo hicieran sería para instaurar un régimen idéntico, pero con otro nombre. Como bien lee Winston en los principios de Goldstein, solo los medios (partido exterior) pueden derrocar a los altos para convertirse ellos mismos en altos y así sucesivamente.Impresiona también el concepto de neolengua, hoy día vemos como el lenguaje se simplifica cada vez más, sin embargo nadie lo impone, somos nosotros mismos quienes anquilosamos la lengua, quienes reducimos nuestra capacidad de pensar reduciendo todo a su mínima expresión, sin ir más allá ""huevon"" puede ser adjetivo, sustantivo o verbo y reemplazar a más de 1/3 de las palabras que usualmente se deberían utilizar.1984 da para un análisis larguísimo, e impresiona como casi 70 años después sigue siendo todo tan vigente, al final la gente lucha por el poder como un fin, y no como un medio, Orwell tenia clarísimo cómo se comporta la raza humana como masa, entendía que la parte animal jamás se someterá por completo a la racional. Como se suele decir, 1984 era una advertencia, pero se convirtió en una guía."
1381,Giedre Milinkeviciute,"One of the best books I've ever read. It will never lose it's importance and it has never been more relevant. It is not just the perils of socialism which are so brilliantly shown but, most importantly, the ignorance of a human being, unwillingness to see and choosing not to think and just accept what is being dished out. It is a battle between simple existence and the life as a free conscious individual with thoughts and decisions, which is so much harder. It is about how easy it is to forget, to ignore and just live, just follow. The danger of losing yourself."
1382,Joseph Essman,"1984 is a very unique book, and the so-to-say ""king"" of dystopian literature. We follow Winston Smith and his desperate, impossible struggle against the all-controlling government. This book deals with all aspects of life, really, focusing mostly on love and loneliness. Orwell defies what most modern dystopia's have, which is a happy ending. This book will leave the reader upset and unsatisfied, as it should; a happy ending wound't have the same effect. While Orwell's view of human nature is a bit excessively negative, 1984 still merits a five star rating."
1383,Lucia Mancuso,"Ok, devo ammettere che generalmente quando i libri mi prendono non vedo l'ora di finirli, ma mai avevo iniziato a piangere e urlare durante la lettura; mai avevo passato una nottata quasi insonne per la dannata voglia di finire un libro.Ecco, 1984 è questo. È uno di quei libri che inizialmente non riesci a concepire, ma poi ti cattura e anche tu entri a far parte di quel mondo, temi che intorno a te ci siano dei teleschermi e rimani sbalordito alla lettura di certe frasi. È costruito e curato nel minimo dettaglio. Tutto è spiegato e niente è lasciato al caso. Nonostante si parli tanto di politica, la vera base del romanzo è la filosofia, la capacità del Partito di aver strutturato un sistema invincibile capace di controllare le menti umane. Sono rimasta sconvolta dal modo in cui il libro va a finire. Solitamente è l'amore a vincere, invece qui no, qui anche l'amore viene distrutto. Winston non fa altro che ripetere ""noi siamo i morti"", personalmente avrei preferito che venisse ucciso con le sue idee in testa e continuando ad amare Julia, piuttosto che veder uccisi i suoi sentimenti e lui che, come un ebete, adora il Grande Fratello.Qualcuno che controlla la tua mente fino a distruggere l'amore. Questa cosa mi ha proprio distrutta. 5 stelle sono comunque meritate, il libro è scritto benissimo, in alcuni punti può leggermente annoiare, ma sinceramente ne ho trovati pochi pochi di questi punti."
1384,Sherry,"This is one of my favorite books ever written. It is an incredibly powerful look at what governments can become, made possible with the best intentions.This book is similar in its warning to Orwell's other book, Animal Farm. I prefer 1984, however. It's also worth noting that this book was written in the late forties, which is INCREDIBLE considering his amazing foresight.If you haven't read this book, do it!"
1385,Xdyj,"I read it several years ago. As someone from a (at least formerly) communist country I was really impressed by its interesting & rather accurate depiction of brainwashing. There's an interesting blog post on this & Brave New World: http://chiusse.wordpress.com/2013/01/... I think it's especially relevant to self-identified western leftists today as a reminder that progressive movements & causes can be, and often have been hijacked by chauvinism & authoritarianism."
1386,Robb,"""Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two makes four.""You are the dead. Oh God, I got so many chills whilst reading this book; especially towards the end. Probably the most frightening dystopia I'd ever read and it must really be an influential one back when it was published in 1948. It completely blew my mind away. And somehow it even managed to surpass my high expectations for this novel. It was that good. It was doubleplusgood in Newspeak, perse. I cannot formulate a proper review at the moment, my brain is fried. Up to now I can't stop thinking about it, so I apologize in advance if this review was kinda messy. 
Random Thoughts
:- This book has one of the most intricate and interesting concepts such as the dictatorship and totalitarianism of Big Brother, Newspeak (eradicating words to limit thought, concepts, ideas, feelings, etc. was fascinating yet frightening), the punishments from Room 101 (I've always wondered where the term came from), the love and lies from The Ministry of Truth and The Ministry of Love, Ingsoc, and more. I don't even know how Orwell comes up with this fantastic ideas. Genius. BUT FUCKING SCARY.- The slogan always gets me:WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH- Although I wasn't attached to any of the characters (I actually found them to be quite unlikeable); they still managed to be original and engaging. They're certainly not cardboard cutouts; they were grey and flawed characters which really compels me to them. That is a good sign.- Winston was a terrible character (this does not touch upon the characterization by Orwell). He was one of those cowardly bitches, if you know what I'm talking about. You know, although he is a rebel against Big Brother and the Party; he used and he wanted the poor people to risk their own lives to sacrifice for the Party yet he never did a sacrifice of his own. He would think he's fighting against Big Brother by (view spoiler)[having sex with Julie (hide spoiler)] but that wasn't much of help at all because it was all private. And the reason he fought towards the end was to impress Julie ((view spoiler)[but if you examine the events of Room 101, he was tortured enough to make him plead for them to do it to Julia, meaning he only cared about her looks and not about what's really in her. Oh that bastard. (hide spoiler)]). Oh and it also seems that he hates beautiful women for the sole reason that he couldn't have sex with them. Oh that misogynist. Oh that sexist.- Every time I placed 1984 down, I couldn't stop thinking about it even to this day when I'm reading other books. It was that thought provoking. It truly is a warning for us, just like what Orwell stated. Prophetic indeed. - It was so sad realizing that all the children were taught and brainwashed to love Big Brother and the Party. Since they rewrote, reconstructed and changed the history in the past, it wasn't hard to convince them, really. “He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.”- The worldbuilding in this novel is amazing. Orwell was able to construct this horrifying, dystopian world which all came as a prediction from his mind. And the world was realistic (a warning of our future), the concepts surrounding it were pretty great (as I had mentioned earlier), therefore creating this visionary nightmare.- To be honest, Parts 1 and 2 of this book were pretty slow. And that is not necessarily a negative thing for this novel because Orwell had to introduce us to his world (most of Part 1 consisted of worldbuilding), meaning there was a lot of description and monologue, a lot of showing not telling. So this book was world driven, you can put it. But after you get past that, Part 3 just blew it. It was amazing. It became extremely fast paced, it was more horrifying and frightening (Room 101), gripping, unpredictable, all those good adjectives. And that ending left me feeling awe struck and I just stared at my Kindle screen for a long amount of time, you can say (goes back to it being thought provoking). To put it simply, 1984 is a gripping and frightening read. It twisted my thoughts; it made me think about things that I wouldn't normally think in real life. Oh yes, it really pushed me and scared me to the core.""Do you realize that the past, starting from yesterday, has been actually abolished? If it survives anywhere, it's in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, like that lump of glass there. Already we know almost literally nothing about the Revolution and the years before the Revolution. Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.""Oh, and remember,BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU."
1387,Kumari,"I put this book on my ""horror"" bookshelf. I found as I was contemplating my own review and thought of what I learned from _1984_. How is it different from today or how could it be written about today, commenting on the status quo of today, while projecting it in the future?Well, the most popular Goodreads review of this book answered my questions, by putting it altogether - all the shit that we experience over time that makes you cringe, but then your attention is summarily moved onto the next ""catastrophe"" the ""news"" wants to distract you with, so you never have time to think it all the way through. Nor is it possible to pick a favorite cause to fight against because there are so many things that are just so plainly WRONG happening, the stuff that the people around you just let happen with nary a second thought, so much making you cringe (every fucking day) that it's overwhelming. Perhaps It's not the government holding us all back and in, but a huge part of it is the greed of the corporations who control the politicians. The worst is that its the people in our society and their insecurity and general sheepishness that makes it all stick. Social control comes from the people around you, who give the power to the government and give the money to the corporations, who in turn tell them what to do. The idiots do it with a smile on their faces because they wouldnt know what to do otherwise. Look at 1984, it was his neighbors who kept him most in line who he had the most to fear bc they had so completely bought into the system that they'd become eager spies, with a mission to keep everyone in line, lest it upset their own meager since of security."
1388,سَــارَّھْ  سَــالِمْ سَــعِدْ,وها نحن فى عام 2015 ،وها هى أحداث الرواية تقع بتفاصيلها مع فروق طفيفة . لربما تحمل بنفس الشعارات سواء ان كانت خفية أو مُعلنة .طيلة الرواية يسيطر عليك شعور بالرضا اذا رأيت نفسك مُجسدًا فى وينستون سميث، تثور على الحزب وتقدم له الولاء فى آن واحد، وتشفق عليه اذ يُعذب وتشعر بالألم فى داخلك .يعجبك هذا الدور لأنك فى الحقيقة أضعف من أن تؤديه .
1389,Calzean,Still a brilliant tale of the possible future where the world is divided into three superpower totalitarian empires who all appear to be in a permanent state of war and history is changed to reflect the current version of truth. North Korea shows the book is not far from the being wrong in how the masses are manipulated to believe whatever propaganda is served up by the Government.Poor Winston Smith is the main character who dreams of a better world but knows in the end that only through compliance will he survive.
1390,Hoda,"الان کتاب 1984 ارول رو تمام کردم. جز وحشتناک ترین کتاب هایی بود که خواندم. وحشتناک. وحشتناک. توصیف صریحش از تسلط بر افراد و...از هر قسمت اش که شروع کنم درد داشت. سه بار شروع کردم به خواندن این کتاب. دو بار اول همان اوایل بریدم. نتوانستم ادامه بدهم. این بار بلخره تمامش کردم.اوایل همه اش فکر میکردم چقدر وضعیت مشابهی بین محیط اطرافم و توصیفات این کتاب هست. جلوتر که رفتم دیدم به کل چیز دیگری هست و نیست. از زوایایی مشابه و متفاوت با انچه که در حال رخ دادن در لحظه ی این وضعیت کنونی محیطم است. به کل مقایسه درست نیست. جاهایی از کتاب داستان از حالت داستانیش خارج میشد و به توصیف عقاید و و روش ها می افتاد. یک جوری که انگار نخ های متصله داستانی و فلسفی اش از هم باز میشد. میشد این ارتباط بهتر باشد. با حفط حالت داستانی ماجرا میشد عقاید را را بیان کرد. ولی انقدر هم کتاب را دچار شکاف نکرد. چه که تمام مدت با اشتیاق هراسناک خواندمش!!توصیف من ازش "" خوب بود"" است. و یا حتی بیشتر. از عقایدمش پیرامون مسائل خوشم آمد!کسی یکبار میگفت گویی ارول داستان را از زمان پیرامون ما روایت میکند نه سالها پیش. در واقع انچه که نوشت توصیف و برداشتش از ذات بشری بود. ذاتی که که خشم و شهوت و قدرت طلبی اش طی هیچ دورانی در توده ی مردم دچار تغییر نشده. نوشتن از این هسته مرتبطش میکند به متعلق زمان نبودن. سخت نیشست شناخت ذات انسان ها در فرد و توده. ولی به رشته تحریر دراوردنش کار هر کسی نیست. همانطور که خیلی از ما حین خواندن این کتاب چیز خیلی جدیدی یاد نگرفتیم. بلکه تمام دانسته های پیشین ما بصورت جمع بندی تر شده، ششسته و رفته صریح بما عرضه شد.در واقع همانطور که در قسمتی از کتاب نویسنده از قول وینستون مینویسد: ""بهترین کتابها، کتابهایی هستند که آنچه را انسان میداند به او عرضه میکنند""کتاب خوبی بود. به بیش از یکبار خواندن می ارزد. شاید دو بار. "
1391,Pavankumarreddy,"The book gave goosebumps as I read through it. A well thought of scenario of a future frozen at a particular time in history where the government is so powerful, totalitarian would not do complete justice to describe it. Wonderful book!"
1392,Max,"“Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else.” George Orwell did not miss a beat. By thoroughly establishing a world of shackles, the occasional yet significant introduction of Newspeak, the doctrine, and, the principles of Ingsoc, it makes it difficult not to doublethink. On one hand, as O'Brien challenges our existing beliefs on certain concepts such as power, the power of the masses, etc., the understanding of the philosophy behind the Party's beliefs and methods deepens and even starts to make sense. Though in awe, one may catch oneself shaking one's head in disapproval or even in disgust to marvel at such a hopeless, dark world O'Brien has painted to Winston, and, ultimately, to the us, the readers. Two opposites co-existing in that specific moment. Our own doublethink moment.Orwell did not only succeed in ""cleansing"" our minds, quoting O'Brien, ""Intellectually there is very little wrong with you. It is only emotionally that you have failed to make progress"", Orwell definitely made sure that we have made progress emotionally too. Feelings of hatred, disappointment, shock, depression, and despair will surely seep through the pages and fill you up, eventually, leaving you with a feeling of worry, and, defeat, or, hope, if you are an optimistic one. As for the metaphysical discussions on politics and ideologies, I believe that is a separate discussion all in all. I now understand why this book is studied in literature or political science classes for a whole semester.In general, a guaranteed contemplative reading experience that will push you to care and to be critical with the world you are living in. Enjoy this freedom now and let us always carry the hope that thoughtcrime and the Thought Police will never exist. "
1393,Hannah (Spine Tingling Books)," “He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.” How is this so incredibly relevant today? How did George Orwell literally predict the future? This is unbelievably good political commentary and I LOVE IT a lot!Potentially my favourite part was early on, when some good news came on and Winston immediately thought something bad would be announced. Immediately afterwards, it was announced that the chocolate ration had been decreased.It's exactly how the current UK Government and Media work! Incredible. "

1396,Sarah Ramirez,"1984 is such an enticing book because the reality of The Party (the government) controlling and monitoring you at all times even to the point of your thought might have very much come true when the author, George Orwell, was writing the book in the late 1940s. Orwells interpretation of the totalian government that rules over “England” wants complete power over people not to use it for something, but just to know that they have such an eminence power of people. In the book its explained as believing 2+2=5, it represents the fear that everyone in that society hold due to the Party’s power. The book follows Winston and Julia's hatred for the Party and love for eachother that grows as they come closer to finding the rebellion."
1397,Mohamed Attia,رواية كألف .. في كل صفحة من صفحات هذه الروايه كان يساورني شك رهيب أن جورج أورويل حي يرزق .. فرواية كهذه لا يمكن أن تكون قد كتبت عام ١٩٤٨ ... تتحدث الرواية بأدق التفاصيل عن واقع النظام الشمولي الذي نعيشه الآن .. فئة تحكم تحت ستار الأخ الأكبر بسلطه قمعيه بإسم حماية الوطن والعامه والطبقه الكادحه و تقوم بتزييف الحقائق و التاريخ بما يتناسب و ما تريده السلطه و يوضح أورويل كيف يمكن للسلطه أن تقنع عامه الشعب بالشئ ونقيضه في نفس اللحظه بما يسمي بالتفكير الإزدواجي و كيف يتم تشويه المعارضه و جعل مشهد القتل والإعدام والتعذيب للمعارض شئ طبيعي بل يحتفل به العامه ويعتبرونه إنتصارا... و كيف يتم فرض سطوه الحكم تحت تأثير الحمايه من عدو يهدد الدوله دائما ..و كيف يتم إستخدام الإعلام في ذلك .. و كيف تقوم شرطه الفكر بمحاربه جريمه الفكر و محاسبه و تعذيب كل من يحاول أن يفكر حتي في كره الفئه الحاكمه والأخ الأكبر .. وكيف يقنع الإعلام العامه أن الأخ الأكبر يفهم أفضل من الجميع و أنه البطل الأعظم و كيف يتحول الفرد في ذلك المجتمع إلي مؤيد للإستعباد و مقتنع تماما أن مصلحته في ذلك و مصدقا لأي شئ يتلى عليه من الأخ الأكبر حتي لو نافى التاريخ والعقل والمنطق والواقع .. رغم النهايه الكئيبه التي أصابتني بإحباط إلا أن هذا الكتاب غايه في الأهميه .. فهو شرح تفصيلي لكيفيه بناء الديكتاتوريه و شرح تفصيلي لفهمها .. طبعا أورويل حينما كتب هذه الروايه كان في الفتره التي تلت تبشع وتوحش النظام السوفييتي بعد ٢٠ عاما فقط من الثوره البلشفيه .. أكاد أجزم أن روايه ك ( ١٩٨٤ ) كفيله بتنوير بصيره أي شخص .. ولو كان الأمر بيدي لقمت بتوزيع نسخه منها علي كل فرد مصري مؤيد للنظام الحالى ... أرجوكم أرجوكم .. إذا إتيحت لكم الفرصه أقرأوا هذه الروايه .. فأعتقد أن شخص كأورويل لن تنطبق عليه نظريات الأخونه أو العماله أو غيرها فهذا الكاتب البريطاني قد فارق الحياه عام ١٩٥٠ .. فلا مجال للشك و التشكيك في حياديه هذه الروايه .. أرجوكم إقرأوها

1401,Mohammed,"This novel is legend already in its title, i will have to try collect my thoughts to write a short decent review that tells what i thought about this novel. I was lucky i knew nothing about it except the title, the kind of future it was and the story, themes wasnt spoiled beforehand. Its an immsense, profound novel that deserve every bit acclaim, legend status it has. "
1402,Arthur,"	1984 is one of the best book I have EVER READ! George Orwell has done a great job integrating political and social fear into a meaningful and dystopian type novel.	The book starts with Winston Smith, a member of the Outer Party of Oceania (a fictional nation that annexed England and watches their citizens 24/7). But Winston is different than all other Oceania's citizens. His memory works and he can think. He works in the Ministry of Truth, where historical records are often changed so no citizen can learn from the past and no one can deny Big Brother's (a public figure who is advertised everywhere especially in posters saying: Big Brother is Watching You!) predictions of the future and explanations of the past.	Winston learns that he is not alone for he meets a women named Julia who shares his feelings and understand him. As the chapter go along Orwell incorporates romance, betrayal and fear into a great and fast paced read.	I would say that this book has withstood the test of time because it's a warning of how one can use our fears and emotion to create a society in which the government has to keep to keep the masses ignorant in order to stay in power."
1403,Kadir Izgi,Ilk Başlarda biraz okumakta zorlandım sanırım ramazanında etkisi oldu biraz ancak sonra toparladım.şüphesiz şimdiye kadar okuduğum en karanlık distopia idi kitap.hakkında söylenecek o kadar çok şey var ki aslında ama hala Kitabın etkisindesiniz ve doğru kelimeleri seçemiyorsunuz kesinlikle okunması gereken bir kitap mutlaka okunması gereken kitap okuyun ki şimdiki Cicili bicili distopia lardan kopup gerçek bir distopia okuyun
1404,Carolin,"WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH1984 - the world is divited into three parts - Estasia, Eurasia and Oceana, and Winston Smith seems to be the only one who despises the dictatorship of Big Brother. People are being watched, spied on and manipulated 24/7, and the Thought Police will have no mercy for you if you show any kind of emotions. However, there is no way to escape the madness. Even when Winston meets Julia, a young woman with no signs of fear and shares his opinion about Big Brother, he has to be extremely cautious because the government's moves are unpredictable...The reader fallows each step of Winston Smith, an employee for the Ministry of Truth in London. We learn about his fears but most importantly about his vision about a better future without pressure and force and get sucked into his hate toward Big Brother.There is also Julia, a young, even if under cover, rebellious woman, we get to know about half way into the story. O'Brien, a stranger that seems to think just like Winston is also part of the story and, of course the personalized character of the government, Big Brother, is omnipresent.The story is fast-paced and suspending, yet almost frightening and the writing style is timeless. I recommened this classic novel to anyone who is interested in dystopian world buildings but timeless morals of the human race.I really enjoyed the read."
1405,Qusai Dawaimeh,ليس كل ما توقعه جورج أورويل قد حدث ولكن تأثير الرواية بالقارئ كبير وبالنهاية شعرت بحقد كبير على الحكومات والحكام التي ترهب الناس بطرق مباشرة و غير مباشرة وتعتبر حتى التفكير جريمة أو كما أطلق عليها أورويل ( جريمة الفكر ).
1406,Tintin,"Brilliant. Mind-blowing. This novel gave me much more to think about than 'Inception' did. At first I wasn't sure I would like this novel since it was evident from the first page that it was literary political social science fiction (really, what could be a more boring topic to a pleasure reader like myself?). But Orwell proved me wrong. His clear and unaffected prose (no Nabokovian air in here, and it 1984 was written about 8 years earlier than 'Lolita') lured me in, and before I knew it, I was drawn in silent horror as the life of Winston Smith unfolded before my eyes, a kind of waking nightmare that is almost akin to death. It may be a literary work, full of ideas, but this does not detract from the enjoyment of reading. I was genuinely worried for the safety of Winston, surprised at the turn of his life and relationship with Julia, and even more flabbergasted when in the end things were not as they seemed, and everything was pulled inside-out."
1407,Spencer,"Spoiler...Ok, the end of this book is amazing. Not only is it great from a literary perspective, but Orwell also added something extra that was completely genius.As you're approaching the end, the action becomes more and more intense, and your heart is just aching for things to turn around. This whole time, however, you have hope. No matter how desperate things seem to get you can feel in your right hand, a whole stack of pages left unread. So you constantly have this feeling of hope, a feeling that roots itself in the physical and material aspect of the book itself. This can't be the end because you can physically feel more of the book that's left to be read.Wrong.The end of this book completely blindsights you, because as your hopes for Winston are dwindling, you still have that optimism, despite there being less and less pages to read. And then it happens. The book just ends. But what about the 20 or so pages left to be read? They're titled ""The Principles of Newspeak"". Brilliant. Orwell threw in that extra physical dimension into the book, and the end completely takes you by surprise. There's no time to prepare yourself for what happens. There's no margin of time for you to cope with the book's brutal reality. There's no indicator that things are going to happen that way, because the whole time you want to believe in something else, not reality. The reality that is created is just as real as those phony pages at the end of the book. Awesome. I don't know what end I like better this one or Candide's..."
1408,فـــــــدوى,أي كاتب يستطيع الكتابة عن الحاضر ..والكاتب المثقف يستطيع الكتابه عن التاريخ ...عن الماضي لكنهم قله هم الكتاب الذين يستشرفوا المستقبل ...حيث يدخل الكاتب في رهان مع الزمن لأثبات نظريته ...جورج أرويل أمتلك رؤيه كامله وضحها في هذه الروايه ...الكثير مما توقع نستطيع أن نلمسه اليوم في حياتنا ...قد يرعبنا أنعكاس صورنا في المرآه ...
1409,Sam Bivins,"1984 is a depressing tale set in grey world of Oceana. Meant by its author, George Orwell, to be a political message against the terrors of what he made feel like looming totalitarian regimens, it was a frightening story in many ways. As Winston, a rebel of a dystopian and discerning society in which a totalitarian regime named Big Brother watches his every move along with most all other citizens, makes his way through the limited world he must struggle with isolation, love, fear, and betrayal. One of my favorite books of all time here. Orwell was a glorious writer, and greatly concerned of a future without basic freedoms. It's quite amazing to tie in the book with what was happening in the real world during its writing and publication, which was the Soviets communist struggle against the Allies. Its amazing Orwell did not recieve more backlash for what would have been an amazingly controversial book at the time. But all and all, it reads slow and a I loved every word. Orwell is great at crafting a tale. I give a 10/10, would reread and reread and reread again. "
1410,Qais,كم هي مرعبة هذه الرواية!والمخيف حقاً فيها هو أن القارئ يعلم وهو يتنقل بين سطورها وصفحاتها أن جورج أورويل لا ينسج أحداثاً من خياله المحض، ولا يتحدث عن أمور يستحيل أن توجد على أرض الواقع، وإنما يصف وبتجرد شديد حقيقة الأنظمة الشمولية وبشاعة الحياة تحت وطأتها.لقد قدم أورويل قراءة مذهلة للأنظمة الدكتاتورية والشمولية، إن روايته هذه لهي اختزال لكل الأنظمة الدكتاتورية في التاريخ، وأنا أقرأها لم يخطر ببالي نظام دكتاتوري إلا وكانت الرواية تصفه وكأنه هو النظام الذي يقصده أورويل.إنه يضع مثالاً لأقصى نقطة يمكن أن تصل إليها الأنظمة الشمولية، ودون هذه النقطة ستجد أن كل نظام سبق وأن حكم حكماً شمولياً صفاته مذكورة دون أن تستطيع العين إنكارها.وقد يبدو أن الرواية هي هجاء للإنحراف الذي حدث للإشتراكية بعدما سيطر عليها الستاليون، وهذا غير صحيح -على الأقل برأيي، فصفات وأفعال الدكتاتوريات الدينية مذكورة في الرواية، وأيضاً ما ينتج عن الدكتاتوريات الرأسمالية وغيرها من الدكتاتوريات بمختلف أيديولوجياتها ومنطلقاتها، فأورويل حاول أن يجعل هذا النص هو نقد ووصف للجميع، وقد نجح في ذلك.إنها رواية مذهلة، وستبقى عالقة في ذهني إلى الأبد.
1411,Hussein Mahran,"It’s significantly hard to write a review on such a sophisticated novel, it’s simply mind-twisting, it’s the sort of novel that once you read you are never the same person anymore, it’s amazing and overwhelming how a novel written in the 1940s could have that great influence on generation after generation of writers and film makers worldwide, it’s not merely a political novel or a novel that’s against suppression and dictatorship, it’s much deeper, therefore I’m just going to quote some significant parts of the novel:“He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past”.“Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct”!“Orthodoxy means not thinking, not needing to think, Orthodoxy is unconsciousness”! (I really like this one).“Everything faded into mist. The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth”.“In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it .. and what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right!”“Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows”.“If you kept the small rules you could break the big ones”.“The terrible thing that the Party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, while at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world”.“They can’t get inside you. If you can feel that staying human is worth while, even when it can’t have any result whatever, you’ve beaten them”.“The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare”.“War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent”.“Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four” (that should actually be taught to school children).“The masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed”.“They could only become dangerous if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly” (does that sound familiar?)“Because the inquisition kills its enemies in the open, and killed them while they were still on repentant; in fact, it killed them because they were unrepentant. Men were dying because they would not abandon their true beliefs. Naturally all the glory along to the victim and all the shame to the inquisitor who burned him”.and eventually:“Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know what no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me”.“The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind, happiness is better” (I like this one too)."

1415,Ali Fawad,"+=====================+FREEDOM IS SLAVERY 2 + 2 = 5 Say anything enough,and it becomes true.SLAVERY IS FREEDOM +======================+I finished this book a few hours ago. I don't think i'll be able to sleep tonight. I finished it at 8pm, after that I have no idea what happened to me for the next hour. I found myself lying flat on my back, staring at the ceiling of my dorm room. I don't think anything has ever affected me the way this has. I couldn't get out of bed for even longer than that. I struggled my way out of bed and eventually somehow let my mind switch to auto-pilot to guide me to the dining hall so I could grab some dinner. I honestly don't even remember what I ate or how much it cost. It seemed that all I could think about for the next few hours was... nothing, my brain was fried, my world was shaken, my reality was being interrogated. “Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.”It took me a while to get through this because I wanted to read it very carefully and absorb everything this had to say. I'm sure i'll even need a re-read to properly understand all that happened in this to get a proper feel for the subtle undertones Orwell threw in this. This book is hands down a spiritual experience. People told me I would get depressed after reading this, to which I would say that that's exactly the kind of feeling which tells me that I enjoyed a piece of dystopian fiction. This transcended depression, this overthrew any feeling I had ever felt before. I didn't know how to register what I had just experienced. Everyone I met after reading this thought I had smoked something or was under the influence of something (which I most certainly was... THIS!). I don't know if anything else is ever going to make me feel like this again. “If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—for ever.”The content of this book is fairly simple to understand, the theme starts off like any other totalitarian dystopian novel. The interesting bits are in the little details Orwell changed to make this truly into one of the greatest pieces of literature ever written. The sheer scope of Orwell's thought process gives sends shivers down my spine. How he so coherently formed the arguments of Big Brother and the Party and the way the party practiced absolute domination of thought, action, feeling and emotion was not only brilliant, but mind-numbingly terrifying to even fathom. Newspeak: “Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.” Doublethink: “The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation. These contradictions are not accidental , nor do they result from from ordinary hypocrisy: they are deliberate exercises in doublethink”The concept of Newspeak, Doublethink, Thought-Crime, Thought-Police, telescreens, all of it was so drastically different than what I ever imagined at first. The scary part was when I realized that all of that happened in there... wasn't really anything out of fiction. All of it... ALL OF IT, has happened, been happening or will happen in the not so distant future. I don't know how society is going to turn out to be, but I don't think if i'm part of something like this, i'll even know if I hate it. How does one dislike something when the concept of liking and disliking has been eliminated from existence? The last few pages of this book were by far the most disturbing ones. All throughout the novel, the protagonist keeps convincing himself that his thoughts were his own, that no one, not even big brother could infiltrate them and that was according to him the party's greatest flaw. We all know how that turned out to be. I feel so much hate for the party to what they did to Winston, I feel all this rage because they even took that away from him. The hubris of the party was clear when they told Winston that they would not tolerate any form of insubordination, even in death. Even in death, Winston could not have his own thoughts. I think that was what brought all of what had happened in the novel home. That ending sentence, which in my opinion has to be the greatest conclusive statement i've ever read: (view spoiler)[""I loved Big Brother.""
(hide spoiler)]“To die hating them, that was freedom.”The thing that terrified me the most was how the party controlled even the most logical of facts and could easily condition anyone to believe that the most basic of axioms were false. They conditioned Winston to believe that 2+2 was actually 5. Not make him say it, made him believe it! When O'Brien held up 3 fingers, Winston saw 5. Just writing that gave me severe goosebumps... I'd rather kill myself than live in a world where even my thoughts aren't private.“It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words.”There is so much in this book that I need to think about. It will probably keep me up for many days trying just to understand all of the things that happened in this, but I know one thing for sure... there will never be anything like this ever again. I salute you George Orwell for melting my brain from the grave. "

1424,Tom,"This is one of my favourite books that we read at school, and it is one of my favourite books overall."
1425,Madeline L,"George Orwell created 1984 as a futuristic dystopia where the government, or the Party, has control over everything. Citizens have completely lost their right to privacy. There are telescreens in almost every room, where the government can hear and see you. The Thought Police are almost everywhere, so you cannot talk about the Party, else there will be horrific consequences. Even something such as love is taken away from you. The government makes sure that no one has a passionate relationship with anyone, relationships are strictly allowed so the couple has kids. The government even has control over the language, where every so often words get wiped out of the dictionary, trying to make language simpler. All of the literature and news articles are re-worded and re-written, making it highly impossible to learn anything about the past. The protagonist Winston Smith starts to understand and realize the harsh rules of Big Brother, the speaker of the Party that no one has actually ever seen, and starts to revolt. The fist way he revolts is by buying a diary and writing things such as “Down with Big Brother”, and all of his feelings towards the Party. At his job, where he edits newspapers, he runs into this girl named Julia, who takes him to a secret hideout where they talk badly about the Party. Everything they do together is strictly against the Party’s rules. Winston Smith has an underlying desire to be in a group of other like him looking towards overthrowing the Party, that he thinks still exists. The day Winston and Julia both get caught is when you learn how the Party really works, and the plans for the future. You get an inside look at how it runs things, and how it changes people.George Orwell did an excellent job at creating a simply terrifying futuristic book. I believe everyone should read this because it is just a completely new idea that I’m sure most people haven’t thought about before. This book made me realize how great it is to have privacy and many, many more things. Even things as small as loving a pet, that would be completely out of the question in this book. Some of the Party’s rules are just so unfathomable that it makes this book exciting to read and learn about how things are done in George Orwell’s version of 1984.I rate this a 5 out of 5. It was an extraordinary read and I found that once I picked it up I couldn’t put it back down. I ended up reading the whole book in one day. It captivates you and makes you want to know what happens next. I think absolutely anyone would enjoy this book and find it extremely interesting."
1426,lucke1984,"Words fail. Not because of the genius contained within this books pages, though it is there but because this book has meant almost everything to me. More in the life I have built around what it has done to me... what it has made of me, than what it contained. I hardly remember the begining... I do not think it was memorable; but the rest lives in every thought I have had since. All these years later and I still love big brother... "
1427,Aidan Moss," 1984 is a book about a anti-Utopian world in which the government watches everything you do, and u can be arrested and tortured for something just as simple as thinking the government is a fraud. The book follow Winston Smith who dislikes this government and feels it is not as saintly as it tries to portray itself. This gets him into some trouble when he meets a girl who hes loves, love in itself in a thought crime not even counting the actions they commit. Both him and the girl by the name of Julie both are wannabe revolutionaries. At one point in the story Winston meets this man by the name of O'Brally who he believes is a member of a group of revolutions know as the brotherhood. O'Brain invites Winston over to his house and gives him a book by the leader of the brotherhood known as Goldstein. This turns out to be a trap though and the thought police catch and imprison Winston, for months they torture him, until finally using his phobia of rats they break him.This book is a book that really makes u think,""why should i trust my government,Why would they do that what are they gaining what are they losing"". It really makes you think about your spot in the world and how you can change and affect it.5"
1428,Daniela Hernandez,"This book was so good! I loved it from beginning to end. The story is basically about a dystopian society. The book was written before 1984 and it the author wanted to 'predict' what the world would be like in 1984. The world is nothing like it is today. The names of countrys are changed, everything is so different that I took me a while to figure out where the story took place. The story takes place in London and revolves around a man named Winston Smith. He knows that there is something wrong with the government but doesn't know what to do. The government watches you all the time and they control what you think, who you talk to, and every little aspect of your life. Winston seeks out people to help him figure out what to do with the government and eventually finds a girl. I can't say much without spoiling the book. One reason why I liked it was because it wasn't rushed. The book played out somethings and elaborated on thoughts so it wasn't very fast paced. I liked how it had details about everything basically because there was hardly and dialogue. Another reason why I liked it was because it let you see how things can be. It was a different world than what were used to and it was interesting reading how the world would work if it were like this. I really enjoy reading dystopian books so thats also why I enjoyed the book. I would most definitely recommend this to a friend. "
1429,Abanoub George,“The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.” 
1430,Kevin W Deveno,"This was one of my favorite books in high school. The intensity of it kept my attention from start to finish, a feat not easily done by a classic. As I read through this as an adult, I realized how prophetic Orwell truly was. Today, I read this book and found it anxiety producing because of how accurate Orwell's vision truly was. If you haven't read this and always wondered about it, read it now. It will impress upon you how valuable you freedom is. It will also illustrate why constant war states are destructive to the liberty and freedom of the world. Orwell knew the value of privacy, which is wholly under represented in today's political discourse. 1984 is as important today as it was when it was written in 1948. "
1431,Guan van Zoggel,"Much has been written, said and discussed about George Orwell's novel 1984 and I highly doubt I will be able to contribute to the existing heap of reviews, opinions and analyses. But - to sum up some random thoughts that occur to me at present - I feel that 1984 masterfully extends beyond the boundaries of the diegesis and grasps the reader like few other books (I have read) have managed to do. Whilst I would not want to go as far as arguing that it delivers fear, I do feel that 1984 evokes a genuine anxiety. It makes its readers aware of the fragility of the human, in both body and spirit. This fragility is not exclusive to Winston; in fact, many of us - including myself - are weaker than him. We carry around smartphones, each linked to at least one social network and keeping our profiles up-to-date - and by doing so, voluntarily accumulating a database of personal information and handing it over to, for example, Google and Facebook. However, their, among others, intents probably (we assume) differ from 1984's Inner Party (whatever they were in reality). For more on this, see Andrew Keen's Digital Vertigo.The reason why I gave 1984 five out of five stars is because it is a timeless essay, arguably more relevant to the present than it was in 1949; thought-provoking, especially in part two and three; and it provides a well-written critique on totalitarianism. That's it - for now. "
1432,Andd Becker," To understand a news commentator's reference to ""Orwellian"" politics, read this expunged facts/rewrite- of-history classic."
1433,Linguana,"Full review at sff book review.By far one of the scariest and most important books I have ever read. Thinking about it still chills me to the bone. Not only does it offer a great and thrilling story, vivid characters, and fantastic writing, but it is also as relevant today as it must have been for Orwell when he wrote it in 1948. This is not a happy read, it will not make you feel good, it will not leave you much hope, but it will make you think and question our society. And that may just be the most important thing."
1434,Keegan King,It all comes together at the very end with the last sentence. Creepiest line ever.

Winston Smith is the main character of this novel and works for the government Party which is ruling over Oceania - one of the three nations that include the entire globe. Oceania is led by a totalitarian government which disallows all acts of individuality or any thoughts of individuality as well. The Party's leader is known as Big Brother whom we never see in the actual novel except for on posters and videos. The ""Party"", as it is referred to, is in control of absolutely everything. They control the past, present, and future. Winston himself works in the Ministry of Truth whose priority is to alter history in order to agree with the Party's present actions. All measures are taken as to eliminate opportunities for low ranking workers to have rebellious thoughts such as literally deleting words from the vocabulary that which allow them to do this. The Party is always watching everyone's actions on what they call ""telescreens"" so it's extremely difficult to get away with any crime. Winston fantasizes of joining a group named the Brotherhood whose objective is to ultimately overthrow the Party. An opportunity comes to him when he meets a man known as O'Brien who pretends to be a member of the Brotherhood so he can set a trap for Winston. Also, in the midst of all this Winston has fallen in love with a women he used to despise named Julia. Julia also has the same ambitions for overthrowing the Party and meets with O'Brien together with Winston. Finally, soldiers take Winston and Julia to the Ministry of Love because they have committed open acts of rebellion against the Party. O'Brien reveals himself here as being a faithful spy of the Inner Party and from then on spends months torturing and brainwashing Winston until he finally submits himself to the Party. Winston's greatest fear is rats. O'Brien sends him to ""Room 101"" to face his dreaded fear where he finally gives in to what O'Brien wanted all along; Winston begs them to torture Julia and not himself. The Party has successfully cracked Winston and cleansed him of all rebellious thoughts against the Party so they release him into society once again where he has learned to love Big Brother.
Personal Response to Book
It was very interesting to read a book which concerned the future which is already in the past. 1984 was written in 1949 about the future taking place in the year 1984. However, of course, it is now 2010 and 1984 has gone and passed. The story line itself was very easy to follow, but there were many parts that were hard to digest because of the complex theories that Orwell wrote about. I think that this story was written as a warning or a prediction of what the world could be in the future - the entire Earth ruled by totalitarian governments. I learned from the story that Orwell meant to say that no matter how hard we tried we would not be able to overpower the government that was in power. He was saying that everyone is getting brainwashed into following the governments rule without any individuality or freedom. First, Orwell presents a glimmer of hope when Winston thinks that if hope is here, it must lie with the ""proles"" who have the most freedom out of everyone. This hope is crushed when Orwell brings in O'Brien who brainwashes Winston and brings everything back to ""peace"". This is obvious when Winston tries to rebel against the Party, but his attempts fail because O'Brien was secretly a spy all along. 1984 was very enjoyable and it completely opened my eyes to government politics. Orwell's style of writing was difficult to read at times, but it was necessary to get his point across by using elaborate words and phrases to express himself. Orwell's lectures on politics and the totalitarian government were not boring at all; however, they were quite fascinating. At one point of the story I felt the same way as Winston because of the way that our life is governed by School during the School year. Five days a week for nine months I have the exact same routine. The only difference is that his is much more drastic. The main characters made for a very exciting story. Winston and Julia were the humans who managed to rack up enough courage and stand up for what little freedom they managed to salvage, but in the end failed. I feel that Orwell is saying that totalitarian governments were going to take over and everyone would obey them completely without chance of regaining their freedom. O'Brien played a great role of capturing and deceiving which is how much of the world works today. Overall, it was an amazing book I highly recommend it to everyone.
Favourite Quotes
1. Here Winston is talking about an incident in the past when he had an opportunity to push his mother of a cliff if he'd been the same person that he is now. ""Only because I prefer a positive to a negative. In this game that we're playing, we can't win. Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds, that's all (142)."" He further explains that it would not have mattered whether or not he killed her because she was insignificant. Either way it was a failure, just if he had killed her it could've been a better failure. I think lots of people can connect to this because if you're in a situation where you're going to lose or fail you should still give it your all as to go out with pride.2. These is the primary slogan of the Party as it frequently repeated in the novel. ""War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength (6)."" It took a while for this slogan to grow on me, but eventually it became one of my favourites because of the controversy in each of the three concepts. After learning what ""doublethink"" was I finally understood this slogan. The Party is able to force all citizens to believe whatever they wish with enough power.3. Next, these aren't really quotes, but they're titles given to departments in the government and are related to the official party slogan. This was really cool how Orwell showed that the Party could force doublethink on all the citizens; The Ministry of Peace being in charge of War related issues, The Ministry of Love in charge of torturing people like Winston for committing crime, and the Ministry of Truth in charge of alter historic events in order to agree with what the government is saying currently.4. This quote is from when O'Brien explains what power truly is to Winston. ""Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing (279)."" I completely agree with what O'Brien is saying here because I think that no one has true power over us until they are able to change what we believe and think. We can be forced to say things that we don't truly mean, but it's hard to make someone mean it.5. Winston writes this in his diary; ""Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious (74)."" This is a very nihilistic comment and I think was a very key thought that Winston had in his mind at the time. He was writing this in reference to those who did not have the presence of mind to rebel and stand for freedom. Winston realizes that until the citizens snap out of this mind control they will never rebel, but they cannot snap out of it until they have rebelled. Basically, he's saying that there's no hope."
1436,Erssie,"I loved this book when I read it as a teenager.Now the thing that annoys me when I read reviews about this book, is that a lot of readers assume that it is a science fiction novel and was Orwell's actual prediction of a future set in that particular year. That is missing the point. This is one of those dystopian novels that is set in the future so that the author can use ideas to reflect our own attitudes to politics of contemporary times. Having been involved in more than one war (including the Spanish civil war), Orwell's book was only named and set in 1984 because those numbers were a rearrangement of 1948, the year which Orwell wrote this. Orwell fully expected the novel to reflect the ideas and times he had experienced, and to explore the attitudes towards the individual's place in society after the past 35-40 yrs or more had seen Europe torn apart with wars based on some extreme ideologies (Nazism & the Holocaust, fascism, commnunism etc etc). For me, it was not the ''Big Brother is watching you'' thing that I thought was the most chilling about this novel, what I felt very strongly was that when it came down to it, an individual's love for another individual and their spirit is often dwarfed under the daily grind of the rest of the World that you live in. Love seems like a superflouos luxury, an ideal that can never really be attained. For the individual ideals can be betrayed in a heartbeat to save oneself and in order to gain happiness conforming to every other area of society as a whole.As a teenager, when I read this, obviously exploring adult relationships including romance were of interest to me. I had high ideals, I felt I would die for my friends or a noble cause if I had to. But 1984 showed me that human beings are ultimately frail, and will and can betray...it is just a fact that even love is selfish. And it is often the nameless machine of 'society' that presses down on any individuals who cannot or do not want to conform. Rather than being held up as heros for their individuality, people who are 'different' are often chipped away at for years, until eventually, they would be capable of self preservation and the sort of betrayal seen in 1984....I still believe there are those out there with exceptional ideals. However, age has taught me, that the majority of humans will drop any action or cause in order to improve things for themselves. When they have a family, I think doing things for little beings is no less selfish, kids are really just extensions of our own bodies. People always opt for self preservation, and you see it time and again that folk are doing things because they ''want a better life for their family''. How often do we see individuals who truly sacrifice themselves for another's benefit? Rarely. People give money to charity...but they would not do so if it meant they really went without....I am not saying I am any better, but just that for me, 1984 was a wake up call to the utter selfishness of human behaviour and the pointlessness of trying to stick out from the crowd."
1437,Matteo Di Maggio,"Avete presente i metdi oppressivi e tirannici del nazismo e del comunismo? Ecco dimenticateli! Con ""1984"" vi immergerete in un mondo ""annullato"": l'umanità che conosce l'Uomo come singolo, come persona unica e fisica, non esiste più... Ora l'intera umanità è il Partito, il Partito è il Grande Fratello. Tu, singolo, non esisti, esiste il Grande Fratello. Ma cos'è il GF? Il GF è un'entità fittizia, un unico concetto di vita, che spia e tiene sotto controllo (per l'eternità), gli uomini. L'oligarchia del GF è resa forte da paura, rabbia e odio. Questa è la filosofia del Partito e del GF.La libertà è schiavitù, La guerra è pace, L'ignoranza è forza. Ha detta di tutti questi tre principi, sarebbero stupidi, ""da ignoranti"" e folli: vi sbagliate! Ci sono dei buoni motivi per il quale il GF ne ha fatto il suo slogan:1) Se invertiamo le parole e quindi La schiavitù è libertà vi accorgerete che è accettabile in un mondo come questo, descritto da Orwell! Se non esiste l'uomo come singolo, che ve ne fate della libertà? Sarete liberi per fare cosa poi? Morire di profonda solitudine!2) L'ignoranza è forza, perché se sarete liberi dalla scienza controllerete la realtà. Controllando la realtà potrete manipolare il presente e il passato. Il Partito, per esistere, vi vuole ""annullati"", privi di qualsiasi arte o impulso creativo. Se ci fosse il progresso allora si farebbe un'altra Rivoluzione, che romperebbe l'equilibrio raggiunto. Quindi sarebbe solo inutile.3) La guerra è pace: il mondo è stato scisso in tre grandi nazioni (Oceania, Eurasia, Estasia) e ha stabilito una guerra eterna che tiene in equilibrio lo stesso mondo. La guerra, in fondo, è come la pace, queste tre grandi nazioni potrebbero accordarsi e riappacificarsi per l'eternità. Ma allora perché scegliere proprio la guerra? Per distruggere il consumismo, distruggere tutto ciò di cui l'uomo ha abusato in termini economici. Sia chiaro questa guerra non è una guerra ""normale"", ma solo d'élite!Un vero capolavoro, distopistico, che stravolge la realtà, in cui vediamo come protagonista Winston Smith, l'ultimo ""essere umano""."

1439,Nada AM,"Read this when you're up to read something that is powerful, deep, genius and enlightening.Although I at times failed to comprehend what the writer implicated I still could sense the author's farsightedness. Reading it was not always ""fun"", it takes times. Probably due to its intricate language. So read it when you have a clear mind that's striving for something that would trigger it.""Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious"""
1440,Ashlie,"First read in 2005If you haven't read this book, then you shouldn't be wasting time with this review. I know many people have to read it for school, but I didn't happen upon it until one long summer. This book is so powerful...it changes you. It will grab hold of you and never let go.Updated ReviewI always tell people that 1984 is my favorite book (at least that's what I tell people that I can't tell the title of my actual favorite book to, ""Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff Christ's Childhood Pal."" If I'm honest, I'd put 1984 at number two overall, number one in literary classics) so I figured I should reread it again for the third (fourth?) time to have a firm appreciation of it.It never fails to blow my mind. The fact that Orwell could have such insight into the modern age when he wrote this in 1949 amazes me. His predictions for technology were very insightful, as well as how monitored we are in these modern times. I'm not talking about government monitoring though, I'm referring to the choices we make when we live our lives on social media.This book was meant as a wake up call, and I just don't think we really have ever heard it. If you haven't read it, do so."
1441,Valentinab,"Attuale, tremendamente attuale. Con la sua durezza e la sua forza questo libro ci invita a riflettere su temi molto caldi anche nella società moderna. Avevo letto e commentato alcuni estratti già alle superiori, ma la lettura integrale di 1984 sicuramente non può fare a meno di scioccare e turbare il lettore mettendolo davanti a una realtà cruda, malata ma soprattuto reale o verosimile per quanto riguarda certi aspetti della società descritta. Orwell ci ha fatto dono di uno strumento importantissimo per criticare la nostra società e il nostro rapporto con essa. Lo consiglio veramente a tutti, invitando ciascuno a prendere il tempo necessario per leggero con attenzione sebbene lo stile dell'autore lo renda anche molto avvincente e dinamico."
1442,Erica,"This is my 2nd favorite book of all time. (My first is Catch-22.) I chose to re-read it since I'm going through Wil Wheaton's Goodreads list and because it had been over a decade since I last read it. I felt a sort of reminiscent angst while re-reading this novel. I remembered how I felt the first time I read the novel as a teenager, angry at the injustices of the world and feeling powerless to stop it, except with the tiny acts of rebellion I could commit inside my mind and through peaceful demonstration. My main weapon was knowledge and I tried to educate myself in the problem that mattered the most to me, the preservation of basic human rights. Mostly I read novels, followed the news, and involved myself in organizations like Amnesty International (Thank you, Mr. Coraggio!) In the end, I felt like I had deceived myself. The more I learned, the more I tried, the more helpless I felt against the unending onslaught of apathy I noticed from the general public. People were so content with handing everything over to God or politicians that they failed to take action themselves because SOMEONE ELSE WOULD DO IT. When I joined the Army, I felt a lot like Winston. I clung to my idealism and my beliefs, intent on not succumbing to the brainwashing and Stockholm syndrome I knew that was coming. Like Winston fending off the party with his rebellious thoughts while following the crowd, I harbored my counter-culture thoughts with a righteousness that afforded me the opportunity to sustain myself when all I wanted to do was scream THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE at every other soldier I saw. Winston believed that hope lay in the proles, the Army showed me that hope lay in the average citizen. What I was doing before I joined, it didn't feel like enough. But it was enough. It's a start, it's a spark, and sparks turn to ideas and ideas turn to action and action can turn into change. Winston began to slowly believe the propaganda that O'Brien was forcing on him. The only thing that kept him from fully embracing everything as truth were his feelings toward Julia. He fought until they eventually got to him. In the end he gave in and he loved Big Brother. I never gave in that much when I was in the Army. But some things definitely stick. I can't stand to see a flag folded incorrectly or improperly stored. Uniform violations irk me. I still use ""male"" and ""female"" as opposed to ""man"" and ""woman."" And yet, I still consider the source whenever I read information. When listening to others' opinions I try to decipher how they're influenced and remind myself that opinion is a basic right as well, even if there's a nagging in the back of my mind that tells me some have earned it more than others. It's like doublethink leaked into my head."
1443,Si,"本篇都是在剧透。1984是一部久负盛名的带有政治讽刺意味的小说，基本上任何与近代文学相关的书单上都能找到它的身影。但这本书立在我的书架上，从崭新到泛黄，我一直都没有看，政治，社会主义，这些名词都让我望而却步。在近些时候往返上海和往返香港的航班上，陆陆续续看完了这本书，中间拖的时间很久，下了飞机便不再拿起。但令人惊奇地，每次翻开到夹着书签的页面，都不会觉得陌生或者不知所云，仿佛中间从来没有放下过。其实看了开头就明白这一定是一部有意思的小说，小说开头设置在改名为Airstrip One的英国（数字命名的习惯是多么的有社会主义特色），属于一个叫Oceania的国家，为世界上三个国家之一。三足鼎立，互相之间永远在打仗，参照三国。Oceania有四大部门：Ministry of Plenty负责管理物资，保证大家饿肚子；Ministry of Peace负责打仗；Ministry of Love是一堆Thought Police负责洗脑和让人消失；Ministry of Truth负责随意篡改历史，为国民生产包括Porn在内的各种娱乐资料。更妙的是他们的简称都是Mini前缀，如Minitrue，看起来更像是Minimum Truth。我们的主人公Winston Smith就在Minitrue工作，每天都有人消失，他要负责把过去涉及到这些人的出版物修改，抹掉他们存在的任何证据。Oceania由党领导，党员有两种，Inner Party和Outer Party，Winston就是Outer Party，属于中产阶级，核心党员自然是上流阶层，有咖啡和葡萄酒喝，其中的老大就是斯大林形象的Big Brother。非党员就是无产阶级，在小说中称为Proles，他们如动物一般凭本能活着，如果当中出了一些了不起的人，会被thought police消失掉。党员不是世袭，每个人在青年时候有一次考试机会，可以入党。所有党员都要24小时被监视，工作的地方和家里都有一块电子屏幕，永远播放着和党有关的节目，同时还可以监视屏幕前面的党员的一举一动。每天都有集会，在集会中他们表达对正在和他们打仗的国家的愤怒和痛恨，当然这个敌对国总是在变，但每个人都坚信祖国永远在和这个国家打仗。在这样一个疯狂的世界中，总会有正常人的存在，Winston就是一个理智尚存的人，他自我意识慢慢变强，开始怀疑党的很多行为，包括篡改历史和食品配额等等，他在黑市上买了个日记本，开始记日记，记下自己的怀疑和思考，同时开始担惊受怕，因为从买下那个日记本的时候或者更早开始，他就已经注定被消失了。以上就是小说的第一部分。奥威尔塑造的这个1984年的世界在如今看来荒谬而现实，因为在过去的世纪里，故事中的设定都以某种程度成为了实实在在的历史。在Winston胆战心惊的生活中，闯入了一个叫Julia的年轻姑娘，她向Winston表白，带他到荒郊野外约会，Winston也逐渐被这种年轻美好吸引，在Proles居住的街区里租下一个房间，两个人下班后会到那里做爱，煮咖啡，度过一个个缱绻而安落的傍晚。有时候Winston醒来，听到洗衣大妈的歌声，都觉得那个画面有一种难以名状的美。他想反抗党，听说有那么一股暗流是党的对立面，而他又鬼使神差地觉得他的一个核心党员同事O'Brien是这股地下势力的一部分。O'Brien邀请他们到自己的住处，让他们得以成为这股势力的一份子，并且辗转递交给Winston一本书，也就是这个地下党的红宝书。奥威尔花了大量的笔墨写下了这本书的内容，更加详细地介绍了1984年这个世界的来源和本质，社会阶级的组成，资金的走向等等，总的来说更像是一篇批判社会主义的论文。Winston看得津津有味，Julia却听着听着就睡着了。这是小说的第二部分，在第一部分塑造的这种黑暗恐怖气氛中仿佛出现一道曙光，世界变得美好轻快起来，不再忙碌地表达忠诚和愤怒，而是欣赏起周围的世界，古老的画，鸟儿的歌声等等。然后他们被Thought Police抓了起来分别送进了Miniluv。Winston首先遭到了长时间的毒打，以至于培养起不再反抗的充满恐惧的条件反射，然后O'Brien出现了，他其实也是Thought Police的一份子，通过电击这样的心理疗程不断搅乱Winston的意识，奥威尔的写法非常夸张，他没有用什么复杂的命题，就是2+2=5，O'Brien让Winston从心里相信2+2=5。Winston了解到，每个人都会在这里被洗脑，然后放回到社会中变成一个健康的党员，然后在充满对Big Brother的热爱中被枪杀处决，党从来不制造一个殉道者。他慢慢接受了O'Brien的改造，只留下一个，他爱Julia，他恨Big Brother，在心中计划临死前的那一刻便要保留如此的爱，忆起所有党禁止的事实，但那时党已经无能为力了，他便能靠这种办法来完成对党的反抗。但党是不允许爱情的，如果人只能有一种情感，那就是恨，Winston被放到了Room 101，在那里每个人内心中最害怕的事物会出现，在老鼠即将咬到Winston的时候他终于大喊“Do it to Julia”。于是一切都结束了，Winston被放回了社会，他还曾经和Julia重逢，“And after that, you don't feel the same toward the other person any longer.”在一个咖啡馆中，麻木而空洞的Winston在电子屏幕中等待Oceania胜利的消息，他在内心真实地感受到喜悦，那一刻，子弹穿过了他的身体，但他已经完全接受了党。“He loved Big Brother.”毫无疑问，小说的第三部分非常让人抑郁，我感觉应该会有一个不太好的结局，但也没有看到如此黑暗绝望的结局的心理准备。奥威尔的写作功力很强，Winston在Miniluv里的种种遭遇荒谬至极，但也让人感同身受。因为荒谬，所以读者也会觉得非常绝望，不知道自己在那种处境中还能说什么做什么。O'Brien毫不避讳地说出党对集权的欲望，不加以任何高尚的粉饰，但却强势地自圆其说，让人不禁觉得毛骨悚然。你只能劝说一个有良知的人向善，你不能跟一个Sociopath理论，因为他们很清楚自己的罪恶和目标，并且问心无愧。而最后的最后，奥威尔也没有给人任何一点希望的影子，Winston最终完全被同化，党赢得了这场胜利，及这场胜利代表的千千万万的胜利。我仿佛看到在1984的世界中站着密密麻麻的流水线上产出的人，没有思想没有感情，然后我觉得异常恶心。"

1445,Richard Stuart,Probably one of the scariest books ever written.
1446,Adel,"Nineteen Eighty-Four, Orwell's dystopian masterpiece. I had high hopes for this book, and boy I'm impressed. This is a blend of philosophy, psychology, and sociology in one essay. If one can imagine the ultimate totalitarian regiment that can possibly come to existence then it's The Party. I like the noir tone (darkest shit I'eve ever read), the pale and colorless atmosphere, the unstable and at the same time stable psychological state of the Outer Party members. I noted some friction, a fight between Idealism (everything in the mind) vs. Realism (reality outside the mind), Orwell really struck some good arguments for Idealism, even now we can't be sure 100% that reality exists, but realism is favored for its practicality and appeal. I didn't expect a romantic tone, but its tragic end satisfied my hunger :
“Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal.”
It was midnight, and I couldn't scrap the smile out of my face upon reading this passage : 
“You're only a rebel from the waist downwards,' he told her.”
To rebel, is to channel the fury against The Party not against an imaginary fiend that the Party created :
“I hate purity, I hate goodness! I don't want virtue to exist anywhere. I want everyone to be corrupt to the bones.”
In a couple of words, to control the masses you need to induce ignorance, brainwashing, censorship and surveillance, and after all, control by fear and terror. That's all it takes, and this book is a grand picture of that. What struck me most is how the Party conceals the truth, it's by making everyone believe the same lie, by falsifying everything and deleting any evidence, anything that disprove that lie and approve the truth, and when everyone believe without questioning what they are told, the high chance of conformity will prevail over the questioning nature of the conscious mind, by using this :
“Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.”

“He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.”

“Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. At one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the Earth goes round the Sun; today, to believe the past is unalterable. He might be alone in holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him; the horror was that he might also be wrong.”

“War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.”
Oh and the necessity to restrain language or invent one to limit thought, this was a brilliant point :
“But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.”
Until now, this is the darkest dystopian novel I've ever read, the chance of beating the hopeless setting of this false utopia is really hard. Orwell is really a smart guy, he incorporated some decent arguments, and implemented some catchy philosophical maxims about existence, the mind, reality, and the meaning of freedom. The complete analysis of this work should make another book, if not a volume. -------------------------------------------------------“April the 4th, 1984. To the past, or to the future. To an age when thought is free. From the Age of Big Brother, from the Age of the Thought Police, from a dead man - greetings!”― George Orwell, 1984"

1448,Oran,"The novel 1984 is a dystopian/science-fiction classic written by George Orwell in 1948 and published in 1949. The story revolves around the life of Winston Smith, a commoner who is a member of the outer party, living under the authoritarian and totalitarian rule of the Inner Party in London. In this dull and bleak society individuality and independent thinking (thoughtcrimes) is persecuted, history is falsely rewritten, propaganda is slavishly believed and privacy is nonexistent with the party leader Big Brother supposedly watching your every move.Consequently, Winston begins questioning the society and starts to intellectually rebel, furtively writing in a diary to express himself but to also warn future generations. He also starts an illicit love affair with Julia, another party member. If you want to find out what happens to Winston, you’ll have to read the novel. This novel was particularly thought-provoking as it deals with existential issues in society today, where authoritarian rule can be likened to North Korea’s regimes and lack of privacy to online surveillance e.g. the tracking of credit cards, GPS mobile phones and internet records. Thus I would recommend 1984 and it should definitely be put on your must-read list."
1449,Sheila,"A grim but thought-provoking read. I really enjoyed it - perhaps because I read it a second time for a bookclub discussion. Sometimes reading and discussing it with others adds another dimension to the book.One of the things we discussed was rather Winston was a hero or not. He does not seem heroic - he is thin, not very robust, aging, kind of an ordinary guy. But, despite his weaknesses, he is rejecting the prevailing attitudes/conventions – seeking answers to the slivers of memories he has. I certainly sympathized with him.Could he be considered a hero because of his acts of revolution (the diary, his affair with Julia, etc)? He is aware of the danger (the almost certitude) that accompanies these actions but he proceeds nonetheless.This line from the book (last part, chapter 3) gave me pause. O’Brien said:“If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever.Winston did have an amazing job! One thing from the novel that I keep coming back to was how everyone was watched everywhere. Even in their homes they had to be in view of the camera at certain times. Like Winston, I would have hated that.The Ministry of Love was such a misleading name. You would think they were arranging marriages or love between people but they were just enforcing love and loyalty to Big Brother by fear, torture and brainwashing of people. And the Ministry of Truth was responsible for rewriting history and changing facts to fit party doctrine."
1450,Esteban del Mal,This upset me so much when I read it in high school that I vowed to never read it again. I have honored that promise thus far.
1451,Cansu,"Ahh... I don't know! At the end of this review I will give 1 star or 5 stars to this book, I will try to figure out my feelings by the end of my review.(view spoiler)[To be honest I am quite disappointed. All my life I heard how amazing this book is, what kind of an utopia it is talking about, how it is similar to our own conditions as different countries around the world. I thought this is the solution then, we can end all of it as we want. I was expecting a book of rebellion, vicious victory, a way-out of all the troubles of the world. Turns out it was not. I just- don't really know what to say. First you feel so fired up, like our man 'Winston' will do something about it- maybe build an army etc. I don't know.- But he doesn't! Turns out there is no way out of it at all- they have figured out how to deal with everything. And the way is brutal- and TOO perfect. Like there is not any choice he can take, it is all already set. No way out.For me, it was really devastating to read all of this. I needed some more ""spirit"" in this book- more then Winston did. It was so disappointing to read how everybody accepted their situation already, and were fanatics about it. Maybe I was looking for a way out from what our world is going through right now, and in case it all gets worse. Now all I can say is I hope none of 'this' goes that far. (hide spoiler)]All in all I want to say I just HATE this book. But, I can not stop thinking about it, and it has been a while since a book made me feel this way. It gives you a lot to think about. I hate how great it is, how much of an intelligence lies underneath. I don't usually write reviews about the books I read, the fact that I am writing this is enough to say how great this book is. Okay 1984, take my 5 stars.I hate you."
1452,Robert Albrecht,"Never in my life have I read a novel which inspired such absolute hopelessness and inspiration simultaneously. I of course do not subscribe to the all too common rhetoric that we have already entered into an era of Orwellian magnitude, but the way in which he paints a picture of a world where the people are convinced to abandon freedom in exchange for ""happiness"", to acknowledge that it is possible for two conflicting truths to exist concurrently is beautifully tragic. I am slightly ashamed to admit that I have not read this book until now, but I am certainly glad for having done so. I appreciated it more as insight into the psychology of a man broken than a political work (as odd as that may sound), and the grim future of Oceania simply served as its background.Anyone even remotely interested in linguistics will undoubtedly enjoy the development of Newspeak and the intentionally degradation of language. The idea of not simply reducing morality to strict black and white, but removing the concept of black so as to eliminate the possibility for gray to be reborn into public consciousness is not only terrifying, but brilliant (i.e. from good vs. evil to good vs. ungood)A must read for students of politics, psychology, literature, and truth."
1453,Brett Hetherington,"[This article was first published in Catalonia Today magazine, March 2015.]It's not easy for me to be objective about this masterpiece of a book. Whenever I write any non-fiction, I always have one man (figuratively) looking over my shoulder and that man is George Orwell - he is nothing less than a literary hero to me. Despite this, I will try to be even-handed, though I intend to ignore some of the main themes of ""1984"" because a thousand reviewers before me have written in detail about the wider issues behind the Orwellian world that he so skillfully sets out.Of course, if we look at this book as a predictor of the future Orwell was certainly mistaken about some things. The state, for example, is shrivelling rather than being the all-powerful monster machine that Orwell foresaw. Faceless international capitalism, rather than big government has instead become the central force of our time. I think where Orwell strikes closest to the bone is when he captures the touching details of humanity and then contrasts this with the cold indifference of an all-encompassing system that is at every opportunity trying to wipe out the possibility of even a single rebellious individual. In the general society of ""1984"" the subtle points of daily existence are just as repressing as the strong arms of the state. Apartments smell like boiled cabbage and the food is barely edible, the furniture is uncomfortable, rooms are damp and under heated, the cigarettes are cheap and even the ""Victory"" gin tastes foul. For everyone, except those in the privileged realm of the Inner Party, there are no pleasures left except cruel ones like the collective 'groupthink' of the vicious 'Two Minute Hate' sessions. Even the act of sex is in the process of being wiped out.With this as a part of the background, some of the other brilliance of the novel comes from the author's understanding of how the mechanics of totalitarian regimes work. Government propaganda runs through every facet of life. History is continually being rewritten, the official language is being shrunk and manipulated so that expression and thought are also shrunk and the working class population is subdued as well as physically isolated. Fear of invasion is also constant because Oceania, their great power is perpetually at war. Or at least that is what the populace is led to believe.  On top of these perversions, ""child hero"" spies denounce their parents, who often live in fear of the little brutes. Overall, Orwell deftly balances his political content with a love story and often returns to the motif of the human face, in all it's emotive quality. He has a warm fascination for objects and the history within them - how they have the ability to escape the censorship and destruction of so much else that tells of the past.This book has the kind of mental atmosphere that was so poignantly developed in films such as The Lives of Others, a dramatisation of struggles in creative circles pitted against the 'Stasi' secret police in Communist East Berlin. Tragically, Orwell was in his late forties and was slowly dying of tuberculosis when we wrote ""1984."" It is a fitting testament to a lifetime of physical and intellectual bravery and sometimes painful but always enlightening honesty. http://www.bretthetherington.net/defa..."
1454,Ana',"I have been meaning to read this novel for quite some time. I am saddened to say this is the only novel, so far, I have read of George Orwell. My niece was assigned this book over the summer for school and I thought it would be great to read it along. I read it with [immersion reading] and the narration of Simon Prebble was excellent. I can’t recommend enough the audio. I am convinced that without the audio companion it would have taken me over a week to finish it.It is a masterpiece of a novel but it is complex. I really felt this novel challenged my intelligence. I was constantly wondering if I was understanding the underlying message of this novel. The storyline is a plethora of meaning, so many layers. This is a novel to be read more than once to grasp its full meaning. I am in my 30s and I really wondered if teenagers could grasp the complexity of this novel. It has a lot of symbolism. This novel is a denouncement plea against certain types of Socialism, at first, but later on we realized it’s also against our society with the infiltration of extreme ideology and criminal acts committed against humanity. Author gave life to this theoretical extremist socialist society, Oceania, by boxing in a world disconnected from everything and amplifying the new value system. This micro world becomes universal. Every element of Oceania is extrapolated one by one in front of our eyes until we are completely submerged in it. The belief system layout is very detailed and covers most of the book.Oceania is a distortion of our current established core values systems, accentuating the grave consequences of such endeavors. The dystopia setting makes us understand what could be the daily reality in an extreme socialist environment depriving humans of their humanity, eradicating our social structure thus creating a “powerful machine” of government controlling everything we do even what we think. There are no battle of social groups within the hierarchy but total submission. There is only one ruling class. There is no freedom whatsoever, no family relationship or any relationship. Love is simply not possible in that setting. The government become the new God. We are driven into the inner working of such mechanism through Winston’s life, through his observation. Winston represent us, in a way, with his yearning to live a normal life and determination to live as a free man.""His friendships, his relaxations, his behaviour towards his wife and children, the expression of his face when he is alone, the words he mutters in sleep, even the characteristic movements of his body, are all jealously scrutinised. Not only any actual misdemeanour, but any eccentricity, however small, any change of habits, any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptom of an inner struggle , is certain to be detected. He has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever.""Orwell, George (1983-10-17). 1984 (p. 455). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition. I struggled at first because it takes a while for you to understand that world. I was lost in meaning because whatever we know today, in this world everything is reversed, eliminated. Nothing makes sens, no real purpose, no real agenda. However, I could pinpoint this ongoing dialogue that we have nowadays whether we are giving too much power to the government (Heath Care program versus Private sector; the salvage of the stock market crash in 2008). There are many truths about that world which applied to us in reference to war, for example. War is a vehicle of distraction for the population to forget their struggle, their miserable existence and reality.""The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects , and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact. The very word ‘war’, therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist.""Orwell, George (1983-10-17). 1984 (pp. 430-431). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition. Many other themes are explored such as:. The power of thoughts, indoctrination. Debate of the totalitarian mind which O’Brien impersonates during Winston’s imprisonment.. Definition of Power and dictatorship and it’s madness which alludes to Genocide committed in the world.. Philosophical questions on human nature, laws of nature, dignity, moralityThe party slogan are:1. “war is peace”Winston’s life is the perfect example of such belief.2. “Ignorance is strength”Despite this world being estranged from ours, Winston’s criticism echoes to our time as well.If I have a complaint it would be about the underground revolutionary group, “Brotherhood”, which tactics of operation were not loyal. It seemed fake, like a false hope to confuse the people. Therefore, it is a fatalistic world: there is no escape whatsoever, no hope to hold on to. Everything that is good in life can’t survive in that system. There is no belief of Heaven. It’s impossible to enjoy the simple pleasures of life, no memory, no past, no History, no words. History is constantly manipulated by the alteration of events and a new dictionary is created with the sole purpose of eliminating meaning.""Cut off from contact with the outer world, and with the past, the citizen of Oceania is like a man in interstellar space, who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down. The rulers of such a state are absolute, as the Pharaohs or the Caesars could not be.""Orwell, George (1983-10-17). 1984 (p. 429). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition. This is a harsh, unimaginable world that you couldn’t possibly fathom and that’s where you become so hooked, so tense and fearful for Winston. You hope that Winston will collapse this outrageous system. This is a masterpiece of a novel because despite being a paradoxical world to ours, Winston’ criticisms apply to our current issues. This novel encompasses many aspects of human’s purpose in society. The end was fatalistic leaving us wondering if the author’s message could be how society and human dignity could come to an end under such extreme beliefs systems. "
1455,Tiffany,"Old thinkers unbelly feel Ingsoc. is Mr. Orwell's Newspeak for ""Those people whose ideas were formed before the revolution can not have a full emotional understanding of the principle of English Socialism."" I've always been impressed with writers who are linguistically capable on top of being able to tell a story. To make up non existent languages (as Mr. Orwell's contemporary, J.R.R. Tolkein, did) or to recognize how social pressures will alter, shave and retexturize language the way Anthony Burgess did in Clockwork Orange, is a noble, remarkable talent. In fact, I'm still shaking at how amazing this book is. Everything has been said about it; I have nothing new to bring to the plate, except to express amazement at how well Mr. Orwell synthesized the horrors of World War II, air raids, images of Concentration Camp survivors, illness, prolonged deprivation, rationing, Fascism, Socialism, Communism, in fact all ""isms"" that were being explored by the New World Order. Apparently, he wrote most of this book in a rush after the death of his beloved wife, in a cheerless, dank set of rooms on the Isle of Skye during particularly drear Winter. Despite the war being over, rations were still in effect at that time. He was dying of tuberculosis. His publisher kept at him to finish the book and his manuscripts were messy, illegible and sometimes hallucinatory. The end product was a book almost entirely devoid of hope. Would it have been different if his physical, emotional and climactic environment were different? Or was he driven to finish the book because he had experienced premonitory visions of the future? My copy of the book contained a lengthy appendix, fascinating with complex notes and examples from Newspeak, including the ultimate goal of Newspeak, which was by reducing the stretch of language to euphonic monosyllables, one subsequently strips a person of the ability to form complex ideas. Correlatively, if you pressure a child into suppressing her linguistic span you suppress her desire to reach for ideas. Point in fact: in the Merrimac valley mill town where I grew up (see Townie) my peers used to deride me (and periodically beat me up) for using words like ""plummet"" instead of ""fall."" So, I was a socially awkward kid who read too much. I read science, and once memorably made the unforgiveable mistake of sharing what I was thinking about, because I announced: ""Scientists are amazed that bumble bees can fly given that their wings are not aerodynamically capable of supporting their body weight."" For the rest of my time junior high they called me ""Bees can't fly, girl."" My lovely, complex statement describing a dynamic mystery became a humiliating epithet. This town was filled with kids who didn't read, who got high, or who played catch with their parents, ate Rice-aroni, watched the boob tube, beat each other up ... who knew what they did--but they didn't read, and they distrusted words. The foundation of their language was based on a four word declaritive statement, usually the third of which was scatological in nature. My junior high peers said, ""that is wicked awesome."" Later it became, ""that is fuckin' awesome."" I know this is the correct rhythm because I recall hearing, ""that hurts fuckin' alot,"" a lot. Any reader or able-bodied thinker would assume that's five words, because it is really ""a lot"" but nope, ""alot"" here is a simple modifying adverb, and thus it's four words. (For a wicked good insight into the ""alot"" please visit Allie Brosh's website: http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com... )My point is that because our language was restricted, our ability to express complex thoughts, feelings, emotions were similarly restricted. This is why we read--to expand our abilities to see, understand and describe the human experience. This is why for every time I see on hulu.com a ""top"" commentator write: ""I love there theme song,"" I console myself with the fact that iPad's new commercial is a visual paean to creativity, over which a narrator recites Walt Whitman's: 
the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.
For me, the most frightening image of the whole book was not the rat mask, but the thought that Shakespeare would be converted into Newspeak and then the original destroyed. That is a world I could not inhabit. Join with me, ô fellow lovers of language, let us preserve words at any cost! "
1456,Zell,"It surprises me that a book written in the 1940's which made a fictional prediction of the 1980's have its essence almost coming into shape in this era of the 21st century, specifically, the year 2014 (2 days left to 2015 when this review is written).One of the sub themes of this book is about mind control. So, how does one control minds? By using psychic powers? No. It's simple, really. As an educator, what's evident to me is that mind control is being done through education. Education plays a role in determining the future of the country and where the future of the country is concerned, there will be people behind it that will do anything to get the most out of it so that it goes according to their vision and demands, even if it means to alter historical facts in text books. The phrase 'those who control the present, control the past' which was being mentioned repeatedly in this book finally made me realize how it's being done. One of the ways for it to be done is by altering historical facts. In the book, it is done by the ruling government so as to make the current ruling government look desirable in the eyes of its citizens. Any facts that were deemed undesirable & 'irrelevant' by the ruling government are to be exterminated and replaced with 'new' facts that go according to the government's desires, ideology, visions, demands, etc, you name it. So, when the younger generation has absorbed and subconsciously accepted the 'new facts' as being the ultimate truth (because the Big Brother says so), there is no denying that they will pass these 'facts' down to the future generation. When this succeeds, Big Brother will have a big smile carved on his face.Speaking of younger generation, the children of the Parson family represent this particular group in the book. Even at an age as young as theirs, their minds have already been controlled and they have already subconsciously siding with Big Brother. I can relate well to this situation stated in the book because it's slowly unfolding and taking place. Other than issues relating education, there are others that I noticed such as economic issues and such. I cannot say that I'm lucky to be able to experience what Orwell had mentioned in the book (because I find this book so fascinating that it never ceases to make me feel ascertain) but I guess I can say that through reading this book I'm more aware of how the social, political, economical settings are being allegorized and how truly enough that they coincide with the real world that we are currently living in. If you are into politics and it's underlying issues, then this book is definitely for you! (I'm not really into politics but this book definitely gave me a sense of awareness and a glimpse of information of the such. It's never good to be too ignorant, no?)p/s: I hope for a newer movie adaptation of this book. "
1457,Mont'ster,"George Orwell did an amazing job of predicting people's choice of comfort over freedom. Some of the specific things mentioned in the book have not yet been made reality simply because of their mention in the book. ""Orwellian"" has come to mean an undesirable dark future. Take away some of the trappings and open your eyes and here we are. Both London and Washington D.C. are literally covered by surveillance cameras. ""Big Brother is Your Friend"" is more than just a catchy phrase. A timeless work that is possibly more relevant today than when it was written in 1948. READ IT."

1461,Besho Ebrahim,"كُنت على وشك ترك الرواية بعد أول 100 صفحة بعد الإحساس بالملل وعدم فهم المغزى من كُل تلك الحوارات والأفكار التى يطرحها الكاتب، إلى أن بدأت تدريجياً اشعر بأننى أقتحم ذلك العالم الخيالى رُغماً عنِّى.بدأت ذلك حينما إنتبهت أن الكتاب أكثر من مجرد رواية، إنها رواية ذو طابع فلسفى تاريخى إجتماعى تجعلك تشعر أنها كتاب علمى وليست رواية!أجمل الأجزاء التى جاءت فى الرواية هو ""كتاب جولدشتاين""، يشرح ببساطة مفهوم الديكتاتورية وكيفية صناعة عالم إستبدادى قائم على إمتصاص نُخاع البلوريتاريا وتسخيرهم لخدمة مصالح السُلطة، وتقسييم الطبقات الإجتماعية عامة.الجزء الخاص بتعذيب وينستون هو الأروع على الإطلاق، هذا الجزء يحمل فلسفة عالية للغاية تُثبت مدى ذكاء السُلطات الإستبدادية مما ينعكس على طول مدة حُكمها، والذى يمكن أن يصل إلى الأبدية إذا كانت ذكية كفاية لمحو تفاصيل الإنسانية من البروليتاريا وتجريدهم من كل المُكتسبات الإنسانية وإعادة برمجتهم مثل الألات ليصنعوا منهم مُجرد حيوانات تصغى وتنفذ ما يقوله الحزب فقط.من أروع ما قرأت، النصف الثانى من الكتاب يجعلك تلهث وراء الأحداث مما زاد من تشويق الكتاب عن النصف الأول."
1462,Phantom,"This is one of the most influential (probably the most philosophically influential alongside Catch-22) book that I have ever had the honor of reading.While I was reading this, I immersed myself into it: I laughed, I teared, I felt like a crazy man and I even punched a pillow (because the wall would be too hard) just because the ideas in here are so outlandish, yet so terrifyingly within the realm of possibility, that I could actually felt them as something of a reality (during my time of reading). Anyways, enough about me, lets talk about the book.1984 deals with a tremendous amount of concepts. Many of those concepts deals with the human and society dynamic, how the former affects the other and vice versa.One of the most interesting concepts is the language of Newspeak. Newspeak is a vessel at which the government the government uses to destory resistance. Most exemplified by the Newspeak dictionary(which destroys words instead of adding new ones), the government here tries to wipe out people's capacity to protest and revolt by limiting the words that they can use. This further highlights the importance of words - how they are our vessel of communication. With them we can express the ideas and emotions that we feel, albeit to an imperfect degree. Without them, we are left with nothing, nothing at all. After all, how does one express or much less recognizes discontent without words....Read this book. That's really the only advice I could give anyone. I've read quite a few books, and this is one of the three that have most heavily influenced my perception of the world. "

1469,Nora,"“1984” by George Orwell is a story about a world that controls every aspect of an entire society’s life. George Orwell is a writer best known as having a passion for language and democratic socialism. “1984” reveals that the main idea of the book was to warn people in the present to not allow the future turn into what it is in “1984”. Orwell’s “1984” is a dystopian novel that addresses a society’s totalitarian Government. To me “1984”is a novel that addresses several issues that are happening in our society and possibly in societies in the future, such as censorship. “1984” is a story that follows Winston Smith as he struggles to fit in to Oceania. Winston is aware that his government, Big Brother and the Inner Party control every part of his live as well as every Oceania citizen’s life. However, Winston finds comfort in Julia, a woman who works in the Ministry of Truth along Winston. Winston feels as if he can relate to Julia because she also despises Big Brother and everything they believe in. Winston and Julia revolt against the Inner Party by continuing think scandals, but little did they know that they were being watched the entire time by the Though Police. Julia and Winston are tortured until they betray each other and spill the truth about their relationship, proving that there love was not strong enough. Ultimately Winston becomes brain washed into loving Big Brother. Censorship was a reoccurring theme in “1984” Winston was controlled by Big Brother and the Inner Party along with other Oceania’s citizens. “The thought police would get him just the same. He had committed- would still have committed, even if he never set paper to pen- the essential crime that contained all others in itself, thought crime they called it”(19). After reading this quote, I was left in shock. How is it possible that the citizens of Oceania are not even allowed to think their own thoughts or better yet right those thoughts down? I know that I enjoy having my 1st Amendment. Freedom of speech is a write that every citizen should have. It can lead to great things such as Social Movements that could help improve lives of citizens. In no way should it be taken away from the citizens of Oceania, although it does bother me that they do not speak up about it and defend themselves. Winston does a good job about predicting the future and trying to warn people about the future, while it might not all everything is possible. That is the message that Orwell it trying to get across. Proles make up 85% of Oceania’s citizens while the Inner Party only has 2%. It would with no doubt likely that if the proles where to fight against the Inner Party they could gain control over them. Unfortunately Orwell does not make it possible for Proles to revolt, since they are so unintelligent. The writer started off the book with such outrages unfairness to get the reader hooked. I know that as soon as I became more familiar with the unthinkable conditions these people were living in, I could not possibly put down the novel. I was always reading to see what the writer could surprise me with next. The suspense of what other unthinkable conditions the author would introduce next made it impossible to not read. Winston is the main character in “1984” that I saw go through a tremendous change in the book. Winston’s character changed the most after his relationship with Julia was introduced. “At the sight of the words I love you the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid”(pg.87). I noticed that as soon as Julia handed Winston this note that his attitude changed. He finally had a reason to live. I also feel as if all those times he said he hated women was because he did not have one. All Winston wanted since his wife Kathleen left him was love and affection. I think that when he realized that Julia was the person that could give him that he finally had a reason for life. What made things even better for Winston was that Julia was the opposite of innocent. Since part of the reason that Winston wanted her was that she went against everything the party believed in just like him. He did not want the relationship he previously had with Kathleen, which was sex only to please the party. He wanted someone who could enjoy sex and take part in it not because they had to but because they desired it. Julia instilled hope and youthfulness in Winston, which is what Kathleen would take away. I believe that the writer incorporated Julia as a love interest for Winston because it made him a more relatable character. I know I was able to connect to Winston and Julia’s character on a more personal level because of the love that they shared for each other. The writer not only made both characters stand out from anything that a reader had been exposed to before, but he also brought down them down to a level where they were incredibly relatable. Overall “1984” was a dystopian novel that followed Winston Smith as he embarked on his revolution against Big Brother, and through his love affair with Julia. “1984” is a very strongly written novel because of George Orwell’s remarkable writing skills. His writing style adds to the excitement and suspense of the novel. The way that his novel is written makes the reader not want to put down the book. Furthermore, I really enjoyed reading “1984” because of the strongly written story line and Orwell’s writing style. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys George Orwell’s writing style, and to anyone who enjoys reading dystopian novels because they can be related to each other. "
1470,Matías Kornacher,"The big brother is watching YOU! The best about this book is that if you think a litle about our society, it's true. An eye-opener."
1471,Jonnathan,"Este libro es GRANDE, en el sentido literario de la palabra.Una obra tan vasta es difícil abordarla en un reseña, pero he aquí mi intento de cualquier manera.Es una distopía, una de las distopías originarias de hechos y desde un punto de vista práctico era una suerte de crítica a la Unión Soviética, pero el desglose tan detallado y profundo de la condición humana, el poder, el control y el gobierno, que el contenido trascendió por mucho su época e intenciones iniciales.Orwell crea un mundo post-moderno, repartido entre tres super-potencias en un nuevo orden mundial. Cada super-potencia domina su territorio de manera extremadamente férrea, controlando cada aspecto de las personas, pensamientos y sentimientos incluidos.Es increíble el detalle de esta sociedad creada por Orwell, los intricado elaborado de la filosofía del partido de gobierno y de los métodos de control. Fabuloso...y escalofriante, porque muchos de esos elementos se pueden extrapolar al mundo actual, a pesar de que ha transcurrido tanto tiempo y de hecho Orwell explica por qué.La narrativa es sencilla y el libro corto, pero el contenido es extenso y denso. Donde la moraleja puede ser muy desesperanzadora y el gran aprendizaje (para mi) es que lo que no sabes que no sabes es mayor a lo que sabes y lo que sabes que no sabes juntos. Ó:A = Lo que sabesB = Lo que sabes que no sabesC = Lo que no sabes que no sabes(A + B) < CUna obra magnifica, maravillosa, de mis libros favoritos de todos los tiempo, que siempre perdura. "
1472,Ben Clark,This book is truly amazing in every way. It contained surprising plot twists and had an astounding plot. The plot was entertaining as it showed the horrors of a totalitarian government and its restrictions and rules of conformity. I rated this book five out of five stars because it is truly one of the best books I have read and everyone should be able to experience this astounding work of literature.

1476,Bindiya,"I read this as a Teenager, and stayed up all night. This book is fascinating in it's plausibility!"
1477,Preeti,"Although I have not read much of dystopian literature, I strongly believe that 1984 is one of the finest masterpieces of this genre, essentially because it is timeless, being as relevant and insightful in 2015, as it was back in 1950.The story acts itself out in a world divided between three superpowers - Eastasia, Eurasia and Oceania - with the protagonist, Winston Smith, gradually reclaiming his residual human instincts and thinking capabilities. A major part of the story revolves around Winston's attempts to rediscover and recreate his past based on vague memories and wild speculations. But it turns ugly when the reality catches up with him. Big Brother and his Party try their best to take down another dissenter by breaking through the inner-most mental barriers and distorting the individual's mental core beyond recognition.A great companion to Orwell's '1984' would be Huxley's 'Brave New World' which, I have heard, is quite closer to the world of 2015.(https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg...)Also, Orwell's writing style makes it very easy for him to pen down some very harsh revelations and truths into painfully simple sentences. For me, that's the beauty of his prose. It's a good book, if not a great one. In either case, it is strongly recommended."

1479,Isaac M,Most depressing book I have ever read. 
1480,Bulletproof,"Sometimes we oversee the classics in favor of more contemporary books, of more ‘now’ stories, hoping to discover that one obscure gem that we can proudly present to our friends. But in doing so we miss out on masterpieces like 1984, that rightfully so have been declared classics. Everyone knows the premise of 1984 and thinking back to the time it was written we all understand where Orwell’s fears come from. 70 years later and the nightmare he is describing is still possible. Mankind hasn’t learned from its mistakes and the book never stopped being relevant. A sad statement to make I know and I am pretty sure Orwell would have hoped to never be named a prophet (as he is called from many). A difficult read, if you are a person with a thinking brain that is. Difficult, not because of grammar or vocabulary, but because the society and human interactions he is exploring is hard to ‘watch’. The universe he is describing is extreme but at times feels closer to the bone that we would want to admit. You can’t help but feel for the protagonist as you follow him throughout his journey. As you approach the end there is no resolution and you are left with more questions than answers. A book to debate on and discuss with others. 1984 is the one to make you say: Can we talk about this? Food for thought for many days to come. "

1483,Haydar Almaateeq,إن أكثر ما رادوني في تعليقات وتحليلات بعض الأخوة على هذه الرواية هو تحدثهم عنها بصورة (رسم عالم خيالي) أو مستقبل أسود ، أو ما شابه ذلك.إلا أنني تعاطيت مع الرواية على أنها واقع حال بعيداً عن أن اتصورها كرواية خيالية.فهو يراهن على المفاهيم البديهية في الحياة الإجتماعية.بصيغة أخرى .إن أي مجتمع في العالم يعيش وفي عقله الجمعي معاني بديهة أو مثل ما يحب أن يسموها علماء الأصول والكلام والفلسفة (الحسن والقبح) ، وهل هذه ثابتة من جيل إلى جيل ومن مصر إلى مصر آخر، أم حالها حال كل الأمور التي أصبحت متشابهة واختلفت فيها وجهات النظر. وما مدى شدة هذه البداهة التي يمكن لسلطة أن يغيرها.هذا التركيز والتلاحم بينها وبين السياسة والسيطرة ، والتي تقوم أيضاً على أساس الإقتصاد (والتاريخ وهو الأهم) ولو كان مزيفا! ولا ننسى بالتأكيد (العاطفة) التي هي انعكاس للتعاطي ومفاهيم الحياة من حول الإنسان .كلها بحبكة (مرعبة!) وبصياغة مثيرة للجدل خاصةً في فصولها الأخيرة التي يصبح فيها المغالطة المنطقية هي الحقيقة والتفكير السليم سقيم .باختصار:هذه ليست رواية! هذا واقع !!!فمن يمكنه أن يجزم أن ما يعيشه في ظل كل ما حوله ( من سلطة السياسة والاقتصاد والتلاعب بالتاريخ) لا يختلف عن ما يعيشه بطل هذه الرواية!غاية الأمر أن رقم 1984 يختلف !
1484,Kavita Ramesh,"It gave me nightmares for days afterwards (not an exaggeration). It truly creeped the pants off of me. I still remember that last line, and it sickens me no less now, than it did then. And for that, I love it. It's a true masterpiece and one of the best books ever written. I got more out of it the second time I read it--another sign of a good book. You can keep returning to it, and each time it will show you another layer to explore and enjoy.I thought it was so unique (unbelievable, even), only to learn that a lot of what's in this book is what actually happens in present-day North Korea. Ugh! =X"
1485,Bcvs,"As walls of ceramic are closing around meI'm hearing the gunman approach from behindI don't try to run and just whisper so softlyRelease me, my brother, of my humankind"
1486,Duffy Pratt,"I first read this before the year 1984, back when the date was terrifying. Turns out that perhaps the most terrifying thing about 1984 was Wake Me Up Before You Go Go, and the emergence of Wham! as an international pop success.This is a great book but not a very good novel. Thus, while it had a huge impact on me when I first read it, and while Orwell's ideas have stuck with me through the years, I didn't find myself liking it all that much on reread. The characters for the most part are cut outs. Charitably, you could call them symbols. Almost nothing actually happens. And Orwell interrupts the middle of the book, right before the climactic moment, with a forty page essay on political philosophy. All of that is ungood.On the other hand, the atmosphere - the overwhelming feeling of tension and dread, is plusgood. And, with some modifications, the warnings are just as relevant today as they were when this was a diatribe against Stalinism. Newspeak and doublethink have pretty much become the norm in political discourse, where the way to win the issue is to shape the vocabulary around the issue. And it has led our Department of Defense (which used to be the Department of War) to wage a perpetual, unending war against ""Terror,"" which is nothing more than a tactic. While at the same time, we have a president conducting this war on terror, who refuses to call the enemy ""terrorists"" or acknowledge that their own beliefs have anything to do with the terrorism. That's a lot of newspeak and doublethink going on. Or, for more doublethink, consider the One China policy. We recognize only one China. There was only one China, as a matter of official U.S. policy. But we dealt with two different governments - Beijing and Taiwan.The idea of newspeak is also extremely well done, but I wonder that he didn't take it as far as he could. One of the main ideas behind newspeak is to limit the vocabulary and thereby limit the scope of thought. As he explains, there's no need for the word ""bad"" when ""ungood"" does the job. He then adds the use of plusgood, and for even more doubleplusgood. But ""double""? Why would newspeak have such a redundant word. This strikes me as unhood, even twoplusungood. There's no need for a complicated word like double when two can do the same work.The thing I liked best on this reading was a scene early in the book where Winston interviews an older prole to try to find out whether things used to be better or worse. What's great about this scene is that it shows how much Winston's mind has already been shaped by the Party. He is incapable of generalizing from details and sees the details that the guy tells him as being totally useless. He wants a formulated answer without the mess of life making things hard to understand. As a result, he has already lost a great deal of his humanity. Orwell makes this point subtly, for a change. I wish there had been more of this. I wish he had included more of this sort of thing, but like Big Brother, I get the sense that Orwell was more interested in ideas than in people."
1487,Jerome Peterson,"1984 has left an impression in my mind that I will never forget. The theme is haunting and sticks with you long after you finish the read. For some very weird reason any kind of institutional building, such as a nursing home, vividly reminds me of this read. The characters and plot were real to me and I was rooting for the main character, Winston, who was the underdog. A must read and one that should be reread and reread. "
1488,Jess Watson,"This is the first time a book has succeeded in making me respond so strongly to its words. Towards the end, I felt physically sick. It was a struggle to finish because it was such an uncomfortable, disturbing read. A roller coaster of 'what ifs', many which did not happen (though this didn't matter, because the possibility that they could was terrifying enough) and then the ones (the unexpected ones) that did unfold when unprepared. I don't think I'll experience anything like that again. This book both destroys and advocates the core of humanity, using psychology and intellect to construct such an intrinsic paradox that I still don't fully understand."
1489,Keo84,"Çok beğendiğim ""Herkes eşittir ama bazıları daha eşittir"" sözünün sahibinden bir çarpıcı kitap daha okudum. Bu kitapta iktidarın araç değil bir amaç olduğunu öğreneceksiniz. Güya insanlığın menfaatine çalıştığını, sessiz yığınların sesi olacağını iddia eden grupların iktidarı ele geçirince nasıl bir diktatörlük kurabileceğine şahit olacaksınız. 1940 larda yazılmış bir kitap olmasına rağmen, özgür düşüncenin suç olduğu, bireyselliğin sapkınlık olarak nitelendirildiği günümüz toplumunun nasılda güzel bir şekilde tasvir edildiğini görünce şaşıracaksınız. Mutlaka okuyun, okutturun."
1490,Don,"It just took three simple words on a small scrap of paper to make me fall in love with this book. Probably the best love story I've ever read. To take an excerpt from another book I like that describes how I felt reading this. ""If you're going to read this. Don't bother. After a couple of pages, you won't want to be here. So forget it. Go away. Get out while you're still in one piece."" - Choke (Chuck Palahniuk)I can't put into words how truly great this book is. The tidal wave of emotions you feel for the characters simply grows and grows. I'm not one for the ""and they lived happily ever after"" type of endings and believe me this one won't disappoint if you feel the same as me. It's scary to think that a world such as the one in 1984 could be thought up let alone imagining it actually happening. This book brings out alot of fear in people. Fear of the government gaining too much control over our lives. Fear that big brother might one day take over while the world is asleep to it happening. Everyone should at least read this book once in their lifetime."
1491,G Hao,"George Orwell's literary masterpiece 1984 describes a totalitarian utopia in which the citizens are psychologically manipulated and brainwashed. It is a political novel written during the beginning of the Cold War to warn readers of the dangers of an autocratic government. Orwell uses the Party, led by Big Brother, to share his disapproval of the widespread inhumanity he saw in communist countries, and his worries about the development of new technologies that allow governments to monitor their citizens. The Party represents what Orwell believed to be communism taken to its most extreme extent; a society that promises equal rights and freedoms on the surface, only to instead enslave all citizens as if they were mere puppets. In this novel, foreshadowing and irony are used to further strengthen the theme: the dangers of totalitarianism.Throughout the entire novel, Orwell repeatedly foreshadows Winston's submission to Big Brother. In the first chapter, we are introduced to Winston's beliefs against the Party as he sheepishly defies the rules by committing thoughtcrime. Even though he seeks freedom and wants to start a rebellion, Winston himself foresees his own demise because ""the fact of impending death seemed"" so near (151). The Party is able to gain the faith of the citizens by instilling fear and paranoia in them. Posters are placed throughout the nation with the mantra: ""Big Brother is watching you"", demonstrating the authority the Party has over the people (2). This foreshadows Winston and Julia's arrest, because they are not able to find a secure hideout capable of hiding under Big Brother's radar.The use of irony in 1984 also exhibits the injustice of a totalitarian government. The novel begins stating that ""the clocks were striking thirteen"" (1). However, clocks do not ordinarily strike thirteen which shows that the Party's influence is so strong that it is even able to manipulate time. The official slogan of the party, ""war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength"", introduces us to the idea of Doublethink (26). Although it is absolutely contradictory, the Party is able to force the citizens to believe it by impairing their sense of independence and individualism. The Party is able to psychologically manipulate its subjects, announcing that ""two and two made five, and you would have to believe it"" (80). "
1492,Artemis,"'Nineteen Eighty-Four' - one of the best works of fiction ever written. And one of the most important pieces of writing ever published.Really, I can't say much more than that. This masterpiece was George Orwell's last novel, and the first I've read of his.Historically, politically, and intellectually well thought-out and stimulating. Usually this sort of thing should have bored me to tears, but it didn't. Sure, anyone can write a morality and cautionary tale, but not everyone can write interesting and human characters in a world made real by how he or she has created it. Not everyone can weave a story together with these things to keep in mind. Orwell achieves all story functions spectacularly, with the ultimate moral/caution looming over the writing like an omen. Winston Smith, Julie, and others have realistic personalities, jobs, backgrounds and even habits in a society that forbids individuality. To date, 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' is the most realistic and terrifying dystopian story I've ever read or seen. It is a nightmare that sticks with you long after you've finished experiencing it. It is a book where even the title is possibly misleading, as no one in the story is sure what year it is - as the past is being rewritten and it keeps changing. No one is sure of anything anymore, and yet they don't think that anything is wrong. The process of doublethink can make susceptible human beings believe anything at all. There is a reason why the two countries that Oceania is ""at war"" with - Eurasia and Eastasia - sound the same: leaders who want unlimited power keep changing who's at war with who and why. And no civilian will question it. It keeps the news and therefore the days going. Change what is written about the past, you effect the present - and you have a degree of control over people.Truths are lies, lies are truths,WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTHAnd no one is safe from Big Brother and the Thought Police. Thinking differently can get you killed, or tortured; which, as demonstrated in the story's tragic end, is worse still.Even sexual thoughts - or any passions - are deemed bad. Big Brother is watching you. He sees you when you sleep, he sees you when you dream - dream of rebellion, and the Thought Police will come knocking at your door. Thinking differently from a universal ""truth"" is a crime. A Thoughtcrime. Risks of rebellion are destroyed immediately. You are insane if you are not a happy and mindless slave to the leaders like everyone else is.Will it ever be possible to beat the regime with so much against you? Will such a thought even be dreamed of anymore in Orwell's view of the future?'Nineteen-Eighty-Four' is a relevant and human cautionary tale. Fresh and evocative in levels I didn't believe a novel could reach. It teaches us to think; to think for ourselves. Don't let ""progressive"" technology or higher-ups dictate your life - your mind - for you. Keep dreaming. Keep being an individual. Keep trying to seek out real truths.Before it is too late.Final Score: 5/5Other reviews:'The book of the twentieth century... haunts us with an ever-darker relevance' - Independent'His final masterpiece... enthralling and indispensable for understanding modern history' - Timothy Garton Ash, New York Review of BooksPage quotes:'I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY' - Page 91'Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two makes four.

1493,Hobbes,"Bon, déjà c'est une relecture mais j'avais oublié pas mal de trucs et ça marche très bien. C'est oppressant et angoissant, Orwell ne laisse aucun espoir. J'ai été troublé par la distinction qui est faite entre le Parti et le prolétariat, masse laborieuse dont finalement on se fout un peu : ils sont assez libres, le Parti s'assure juste qu'ils sont assez abrutis par des films/journaux/chansons créés spécialement pour eux. Le contrôle permanent auquel sont soumis les membres du Parti leur est épargné, mais on suppose qu'ils passeront comme les autres à la novlangue, la fameuse langue dont le vocabulaire est tellement appauvri qu'il empêche d'exprimer (et donc de concevoir ?) des pensées hétérodoxes.Au-delà de l'histoire, quatre idées marquantes à retenir :- est-ce que les événements du passé ont une existence autonome ? i.e. si le Parti contrôle l'Histoire telle qu'elle est rapportée et la mémoire des gens, qui peut dire que le passé ne s'est pas déroulé comme le Parti l'affirme ?- la doublepensée, terme novlangue qui désigne le fait de penser/dire/croire quelque chose, par exemple que 2 + 2 = 5, en sachant que ce n'est pas vrai, et en même temps de se persuader que c'est vrai tout en oubliant qu'on sait le contraire : je pense que China Miéville a lu Orwell, et j'y vois là une réminiscence de l'""unseeing"" des habitants de Beszel et Ul Qoma dans ""the city and the city""- la novlangue : au-delà de la recherche d'un vocabulaire appauvri qui évite les nuances et les subtilités, l'idée que dans la mesure où la pensée s'appuie sur des mots, simplifier la langue en faisant disparaître des notions hétérodoxes ou dangereuses empêchera in fine de développer de telles pensées, et donc empêche la rebellion- la guerre permanente, qui permet de maintenir la population en état de mobilisation permanente et surtout qui consomme l'excédent de production industrielle, ce qui limite voire empêche le progrès social des masses prolétaires et maintient ainsi le statu quo social, le dernier élément qui assure le maintien du Parti au pouvoir. Car, et c'est dit ici clairement, le but unique du Parti est le pouvoir pour le pouvoir, et c'est ce cynisme qui le rend à la fois dangereux et indestructible."
1494,Daniël Gerards,"Relatively short review, because short reviews are my kinda thing.Even though I sometimes cringe a bit at how Orwell chooses to let his characters speak on the situations going on, I really do like the emotional side of this book. It's a very diverse book in theory. I mean, it's a politically tinted, real life events-inspired fiction to me. It's Orwell's political stances immersed in a dystopian world, through the eyes of the main character Winston.Especially the last few chapters really struck me emotionally, as those feature some of the strongest moments in the whole book. The last few pages, for those who know what I'm talking about, are some of the most heartwrenching pages I have read through in my life. (Not kidding at all)The cringing I mentioned early on mostly has to do with the whole ""Big Brother is watching you"" thing and the whole Newspeak language... I guess those things each play their own part in the book to try and underline what the government stands for, I just find them a bit unneeded in the end, as the actions by the government are strong enough to depict them as absolutely ruthless anyway. Especially later on.All in all I love what Orwell was trying to do, trying to keep people conscious of the fact that governments can be quite dangerous and that you have to fight for your own personal rights. The parts where Winston reads The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism written by the character Goldstein (which is not the case at all in the end), really shows Orwell's point of view quite well and feels very much like an essay weaved into the story.The dystopian world itself is depicted quite well, just some of the inventions and catchphrases (War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength, for example) don't convince me of being worth the time, they feel a bit forced. Excellent characters, political depth and mood though. Worthy of the title classic."
1495,Aki,"I avoided reading this book for a long time because when I was a kid, someone completely spoiled the entire thing for me. Not just the overall idea behind the book, but specifics about its characters, plot, and even its ending. After hearing spoilers like that, reading a book tends to not have the same impact that it would if you're going into it without any previous knowledge. This is actually one of the reasons why I tend not to leave detailed reviews (or any reviews) of books that I have read. I would hate to inadvertently ruin for someone else the emotional effect that certain novels can have. However, despite already knowing what happens in 1984, the book is so well written that it still managed to have a huge impact on me when I finally did sit down to read it. And I absolutely loved it.Never have I been so simultaneously infuriated by and completely fascinated with a fictional society. The reasoning behind its function was amazingly well thought out, and the explanations for its existence were almost frighteningly plausible. Despite the unbelievable hypocrisy and completely illogical workings of the government, after reading the book-within-the-book and listening to the interrogator's philosophy, one can almost believe how it might work.Amazing. New favorite book."
1496,Lisa,"This is my third reading of 1984. The first was in the mid-1970s when I was 10 years old (for a school assignment), and the next was in 1984 when I was 20. Now in my late 40s, I knew the book would have a different meaning to me, yet I underestimated the degree. Without giving away anything, I can see the parallels between certain aspects of my life and the robot-like existence of those in Orwell's masterpiece. In the Party's definition of power, I recognized several people with whom my path has crossed over the years. While I'm not saying that this was any sort of premonition on the part of the author, it did help me identify with the main characters in the novel.As a writer, I was also intrigued by the development of language described in the book. Certainly, the English language has not evolved to the same degree, yet I am now old enough to have observed changes in acceptable usage. On that note, I recommend highly that the reader start with the appendix that, in my copy, was called ""The Principles of Newspeak."" Doing so enhanced my understanding of 1984 as I read it, without necessitating interruption."
1497,Linda Jenkinson,"What can anyone say about this book except that Orwell was wrong. Well, at least he was wrong about the date. However, look at the daily deluge of corporate commercials targeted to brainwash consumers with their claims and consider the world-wide corruption in government. The best thing Orwell did with his book was open our eyes as to what can happen if we do nothing to stop it from happening."
1498,Joseph Marvin Reyes,"Great BOOK!It's mindfuckingly awesome!!! And by that, I mean, there are moments when the author, the late George Orwell, gets so confusing, that I lost track of whatever's happening inside the book. Then I find myself thinking and re-reading parts, just to have a clear view of whatever the hell is happening, and get back on track with the story.This is what separates great writers, from bad to good-enough ones. Bad to Good-enough writers gives a clear view of a story, and it ends there. Great authors, somehow, and purposefully, makes you think you know what's happening, but then, you find out that you're wrong. Just when you thought you had it all figured out, they somehow hit you with a twist and all of a sudden your assumptions are wrong.A GREAT BOOK indeed! An eye-opener for the things to come, if we're not careful and mindful of the things happening around us, and of our own thoughts and actions.DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER!Well, well, well, George Orwell, you are what we 21st Century people call LEGEN... *wait for it...* DARY!!! LEGENDARY!!!"
1499,Tony DiTerlizzi,2 stars + 2 stars = 5 stars. This dystopian classic is doubleplusgood.
1500,fenrir,"Alzò lo sguardo verso quel volto enorme. Ci aveva messo quarant'anni per capire il sorriso che si celava dietro quei baffi neri. Che crudele, vana inettitudine! Quale volontario e ostinato esilio da quel petto amoroso! Due lacrime maleodoranti di gin gli sgocciolarono ai lati del naso. Ma tutto era a posto adesso, tutto era a posto, la lotta era finita. Era riuscito a trionfare su se stesso.Ora amava il Grande Fratello."
1501,Liz Cass,"This is one of my favorite books. If you haven’t been “forced” to read it in high school or college, I really History suggest you download at least a sample of it on Kindle or something. I guarantee you will end up buying it and reading the whole thing. It was written in 1949, so maybe George Orwell thought it was possible for us to end up in a dystopian fascist society by 1984, which really didn’t happen. Still some of the things in his book, to a smaller degree are really accurate. Maybe he was more astute then we thought. His timing was just off. Winston Smith lives in a dystopian society where people not only don’t have freedom of speech, but not even freedom of thought. You thought living behind the Iron Curtain would be bad, at least Stalin didn’t have tele screens put into everyone’s home. It’s a device that constantly projects pro-state propaganda. It also has a camera on it that keeps an on you, so it’s a two way screen and it can’t be turned off. This way the government can watch everything you do to see if you are committing thought crime. The idea is that your feelings will eventually come out in your behavior and if you hate “Big Brother” (the government) then your behavior will betray your feelings and you will be labeled a thought criminal or a follower of Goldstein, the leader of the up-rising. Big Brother wants you brainwashed. If they say 2 plus 2 equals 5, they want you to agree on it and mean it, not just pretend to agree, but really agree. You think, how anyone can really believe that 2 plus 2 is five. That just goes against math. Well, they torture and execute people, a lot. People literally get scared into loving Big Brother. Not only a political commentary, it is also and maybe essentially a love story. Winston meats Julie and they start an affair and fall in love, which is big no no. Love is frowned upon. Secret rendezvous are frowned upon. If they get caught, they will be tortured and probably executed. It actually is a cold war novel, if you think about it. It has nothing to do with the Russians, but some of it is very similar to what happened under Stalin’s rule. History is not an exact science, so any projection of the future is bound to have many variables."
1502,Abby Ault,"	The book, “1984” by George Orwell, is about a dystopian future in which “one man” (Big Brother) sees and says all. Winston Smith was an unimportant worker at the Ministry of Truth. His life was seemingly normal. But, he gets dreams and thoughts about his childhood. A memory which should have been burned. Instead of pushing it away, he tries to figure out the truth behind Big Brother and the past of London. He wants to know if everything that they have been spoon feed is fact or fiction. Will he be caught by the Thought Police? Or will he survive to find what was once real?  I would recommend “1984” to absolutely everyone and anyone. It is a thrilling tale about a prediction for the future, published in 1949, that could still become our reality. “1984” has amazing word choice, and is worded amazingly. It has amazing detail, each sentence is packed with action and powerful words. The plot is original, unique, and stunning. “It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him”. Already, the first sentence is full of details. The book will make you think and look differently at everything in life. "
1503,Lacaparouja,"Chiedo scusa (?) per la lentezza con cui ho letto questo libro. Probabilmente la vacanza impegnativa ha contribuito. Ciò comunque non mi ha impedito di apprezzarlo in tutta la sua grandezza. Mi sento piccola piccola a recensirlo, anche solo brevemente. Troppi sono i significati, immensa è la profondità del padre dei distopici. L'uomo annullato, schiavo, fisicamente e psicologicamente, una società non-società, stravolta in ogni suo aspetto. Angoscia, realismo, devastazione. Orwell un po' veggente - anche se in senso eccessivamente pessimistico - un po' psicologo, ha delineato i tratti di un mondo per lui futuro ridotto al non-essere ed anche al non-esistere, con una sapienza contemporanea ed apprezzabile anche oggi. "
1504,Becca-Rawr,"1984 was one of those novels that say on my mental shelf of books needing to be read at some point in my literary life. I had honestly very little insight as to what it was, but was under the impression that it had become a classic, and therefore, had to be read in accordance to my morals. Thankfully, my dear friend and sister, was there to assist my in reading this book. In other words, she forced me to read it, all in good faith.There is absolutely nothing wrong with being forced to read a classic because, as we see in this George Orwell novel, you are hardly ever disappointed.1984 is the novel that introduces the most frightening world one could ever imagine. And yes, no matter what you may believe, I know that this is entirely possible. This dystopia is not a fictitious idea we can avoid, and if you look with just an ounce of effort you can see a example of it in today's society. A world where there is power, you are loyal to the government, you do not freely think, and you are not an individual. You are a part of a machine that works the way the government says it must work. Think against the government and you vanish.The book is written well on all fronts, but it's the plot that really caught me. It was terrifying, it instilled hope, but then betrayed me. I finished the book feeling extremely glad to have read it, thinking it an excellent book, but also frozen with its depressive reality and absoluteness."
1505,Rasheed Namly,"رواية عظيمة وعبقرية بالفعل !تتحدث الرواية عن الأنظمة الشمولية الاستبدادية التي تحكم باسم الاشتراكية والبروليتاريا وتسبر أعماق منهجها والأساليب التي تتبعها لتدعيم سلطتها.تتوقف كثيرًا في الرواية وتسقط ما تقرأه على الواقع والأنظمة الموجودة اليوم فترى نفس الأساليب ما زالت تستخدم حتى اليوم في جوهرها مع الفارق في التطور التقني الذي حصل.النهاية محزنة سوداوية تعبر عن تشاؤم الكاتب الكبير - رغم وصفه للحل إلا أنه لم يتبناه في النهاية، وبصراحة لست أكثر تفاؤلًا منه لكني كنت أمني النفس بانتصار ساحق على أحد هذه الأنظمة ولو بالروايات. ولهذا السبب كنت أرغب في منحها ثلاثة فقط أو أربعة (لأنها كسرتلي خاطري) ولكن بعد نظرة عامة من جديد تجد بصيصًا من أمل يلوح ضمن أسطر الرواية، وهو تعبير صادق عن مشقة المهمة وصعوبتها.وكما قيل على الغلاف الخلفي للرواية: ""رواية تقرأ .. ثم تقرأ من جديد""."
1506,Sean,"I just recently read this book again for the third time and I could not put it down as much now is the first two times I read. It almost seems that each time I read this book, Orwell's negative Utopia seems closer to a possible reality. I get cold sweats thinking about big government and the ever watchful eye of Big Obama....uh I mean Brother (relax just kidding)Many readers will not like this book however. The devastating torture and perversion of human nature is too difficult for most readers to accept. It goes beyond readers who look for a ""happy ending"" there are many who believe that human nature is inherit, instinctual, and inevitably indestructible. The purpose of Orwell's book is not convince the reader that human nature is or isn't destructible but simply to presuppose what if it could be. At the beginning of the book you can easily relate to Winston. Everyone has experienced a varying degree of desire of rebellion and a feeling of oppression. The reader almost shares his paranoia in being exposed by the watchful eye of the telescreens. In th middle the reader is fascinated by Orwell's description of the politics, the thorough details on how this might come to pass. The reader is pushed forward by the drama of a possible rebellion, though all along reminded by Winston's experience that revolution is impossible and by Julia's youth that it is pointless. But it is in the third section of the book that many readers have problems. As the reader pushes on through the torture and brainwashing one is convinced that Winston can hold out. That in the end human nature will prevail, that it must. Orwell simply asks, what if it doesn't? The Party drags out the brainwashing eventually setting him free to allow Winston to finally give in to Party heart and soul before shooting him in the back of the head. One asks what is the point? Why not simply kill him and keep the herd moving. That there must be some evil enjoyment in torturing him like this. But it is in the end that Orwell reveals the true motive is not the enjoyment of power, but simply power for power's sake. To have power without emotion. To give power to an organization and not to people means that no one can enjoy the power and therefore cannot abuse it. Finally giving an end to absolute power corrupting absolutely and is thereby creates a new type of power that is eternal and pure.In reality the idea of Orwell's negative utopia is no more attainable than Moore's utopia. The constant ebb and flow of power will most likely continue through the cycle of oppression, revolution, and overindulgence as long as humans exist. But the interesting point to me is Orwell's question of human nature. Can simply perverting the perception of reality actually pervert reality. If one believes it to be true does it in fact become true. Religious men would think so, many political leaders would lead you to believe so. But this question will remain unanswered as long as we retain the freewill to ask it. "
1507,Cyndia,"THIS REVIEW IS ALL OVER THE PLACE & CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!!!!I am absolutely mindblowned by this book! This is definitely not the typical books I read, butI was recommend this book from one of my dearest teachers. Everything was great! The only part I didn't like as much was when Winston was reading from Goldstein's book. That part was too long, so I read someone's summary. I don't even know where to begin with this review... I'm amazed by Winston's evolution as a character, and basically the fact that George Orwell basically predicted the future/ present. I like the smarty things he would say, ex: *about them having sex* he was saying how it was a political act blabla. That was cool. Also, I love how this book was soo real! It wasn't the typical fairytale love triangle B.S!The main characters were basic people struggling to fit in. I love how I one point Winston was like yeaah Julia's not actually pretty, and also the fact that Winston was like 38 years old. I've honestly never read a book where the main character was an older man! Anyways, I think we all knew from the start the fate of the novel, but I did not except Mr.Charrington to be the snaky spy! And, I was really surprised by O'Brien's craziness. He's such a mad character and has no pity, it hurt to see him act so indifferent while torturing Winston. He truely believe's in the Party's madness is scary!And can I also mention the part when Winston was in O'B house and he said he would throw acid in children's faced, kill a bunch of people and all those things. That was very shocking, it should you to what extent he was ready to join the Brotherhood, and DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER! Also, I found Julia and Winston's 'love' story so abrupt and unexpected. I wish it wasn't only founded on sex. And like come on Julia you 'love' the guy but don't even know him. I feel like they didn't really love each other, it was only an act of desperation and loneliness.I don't know, I feel like the novel leaves me with lots of questions, but I like that. I'll never find out if Winston dies, if Big Brother truly exists, if the Brotherhood exists, and if the Party eventually falls apart. (I hope it does)Okaay so let's finishing by recommending this book to EVERYONE!This book is definitely worthwhile and it really makes you think in what kind of society you live in."
1508,Sarah Reynolds,"In high school, my 12th grade English teacher had us read an excerpt from 1984. I thought that the excerpt was very interesting, and it intrigued me to want to read the rest of the novel. However, we never got the chance to read the rest of the novel, and I was too busy reading other books to set aside time to read 1984. Thus, it has always been one of those books that I wanted to read, but I tend to forget about it. This year, in the class that I am student teaching in, the teacher chose to read 1984. Reminded of my curiosity in high school, I decided that I too wanted to read the book and plan a lesson for it. I also realized that this book is YA and it would fulfill this assignment. After reading 1984, I wish that my teacher would have had us read the full novel in high school. This book shows an interesting perspective of a totalitarian society. 1984 is about a dystopian society. The world has been seperated into three countries, Euroasia, Eastasian, and Oceana. In Oceana, the Party is in charge. At the center of the Party is Big Brother, the ruler. Winston, the protagonist, is in the Outer Party. This is basically middle class. The story tells the journey of his rebellion against the Party. The first chapter of the novel gives a lot of background information to the society, Oceana. I found this background information to be interesting, but I can see where it could turn some people off from the book. As the story progresses, the reader gets sucked in. Winston's transformation throughout the book is interesting to say the least. At first Winston keeps his opinions about the Party and Big Brother to himself, but by the middle of the story is actively rebelling against them. By the end of the story, Winston must make a decision about standing up for what he truly believes is right or abiding by the Party to stay alive. One aspect of the novel that I really liked was its terminology. The Party is trying to diminish the amount of thoughts that the public has by eliminating certain words from language. Because of this, the terms that they do use are very unique. To teach this, it would definitely be beneficial to go over the terms with the class, as well as the Party’s rules, to make sure that everyone understands what is happening.1984 is definitely a great book to teach in an ELA classroom. As a class, we can look at the book from many different perspectives. We can use Social Class, Deconstructionist, and the Feminist theories to analyze the novel. We can also identify the contradictions in a dystopian society. Foreshadowing is very prevalent in the story. Thus, at the end of specific chapters, I would ask the students to make predictions about what they think will happen next. As well as compare the dystopian society to our society now and the media’s role in our society. This would make the learning for the students meaningful. We can explore the themes of the novel, and have deep discussions about the novel. There are some aspects of the novel that could be controversial. The novel does not use strong language. It does not contain much sexual content. However, it does refer to sex quite a bit because it discusses how the Party is against sex as a pleasurable experience. Also, Winston has sex with a prostitute, but the description is not very explicit. There is quite a bit of violence in the book. Also, there is a lot of talk about the government being flawed."
1509,Sama," Mindfuck. 1984 has to be one of the best -if not *the* best- book ever written. And easily one of the most depressing, crushing, overwhelmingly tormenting books ever written. It's so sad that it's scary. Worse than most horror movies out there. And what makes it so is how real it is. Orwell's perhaps brightest gift is his vivid description of events and, more importantly, thoughts. He described dead in a lively way, cold warmly, bleakness brightly. With every letter, you were sinking deeper & deeper, sinking in his world & sinking in your grief. Reading it, one's inflicted with 2 opposing but not contradictory emotions: You get the feeling that Orwell's universe is so bad, so wrong & twisted that it would never materialise in our world, would never come to happen. At the same time, there's that haunting fear that it will happen. At some point. That humanity is well going down that road & Orwell was only off by 50 years, a century, 50 centuries; it's just a matter of time. Hell, sometimes it seems so close to reality that you worry if it *is* happening. In any case, be it properly picked symbolism or accurate prediction, the fear is there. And worse than fear is hopelessness. Helplessness. The nagging notion to give up on life & wail in a corner, or simply finish yourself off. Some say that 1984 is not a novel as much as it is an article: true. Throughout the book, I failed to feel any sort of interest or genuine compassion towards Winston as a person. He was just an object, a sample that Orwell chose to illustrate the practices of the Party and their effects on. Same for Julia. The only character that drew my interest was O'Brien. When he talked, it was like listening to (or rather reading) Hitler talk. His engrossment & almost religious faith in every word he uttered, no matter how dogmatic or purely nonsensical it was, is fascinating. However, this does not in any way possible lessen its grandeur. On the contrary, it can be argued that this detachment from characters adds to the atmosphere of mishap & portrays a more faithful image of this dehumanized society. What strikes me most about 1984 isn't its politics, complex & mind-boggling as it is, but its psychology. Orwell depicts human-beings as evil & selfish at the core, not merely by the doings of the Party. He leaves you wondering, ""Would I do the same were I ever put in such a situation?"" As to the politics.. It has been a topic of discussion for decades now. Yet, one can never say ""All has been said & done."" with 1984. It can always be viewed in different light, analysed, re-analysed, & analysed all over again. All I can say is that I am absolutely completely totally mindfucked right now to form any coherent thoughts, and the minute one question is answered, a 1000 new ones pop in my head. That is the beauty of it. Overall, 1984 was an exhaustive, compelling, tantalizing read. Never have I been so deeply affected, in heart & mind, by a book. On a side note: 1984 is arguably the most inspiring work for the music industry. I fail to think of a great musician who was not influenced by it at some point of their career. And I also fail not to appreciate Radiohead's lyrical genius in capturing the essence of the book in song throughout their albums, specifically Hail To The Thief & OK Computer. "
1510,Nikki,"Depressing, and worrying. I read this first what feels like an awful long time ago -- if I was in my teens when I first read it, I'd be surprised. It's amazing how influential it is, how much our culture references it. And how little people actually know about it, if quizzed."
1511,Hussain Radhi,"١٩٨٤ هي أشهر ما كتب جورج أورويل بجانب روايته ""مزرعة الحيوان"" والتي تندرج ضمن روايات الدستوبيا او الخيال السياسي. تم نشر الرواية عام ١٩٤٩م لتتنبأ بما ستؤول عليه الأوضاع السياسية والاجتماعية والاقتصادية في عام ١٩٨٤م. هي رواية تكهنية وقد تكون تحذيرية مما سيجره الحكم الشمولي ، الذي ينقسم إلى الحزب الداخلي وهم النخبة وأصحاب السلطة، ثم الحزب الخارجي، ثم البقية المسحوقة. وتكون كل صغيرة وكبيرة مراقبة بشكل دقيق حتى يكاد النظام يعرف ما يدور في خلد المواطن أيضا.تدور أحداث الرواية حول ونستون، البطل، الذي يعمل في الحزب الخارجي ضمن وزارة الحقيقة كعالمٍ في اللغة الحديثة ووظيفته طمس وتزييف الأخبار والمقالات التي سبق نشرها وتم ثبوت عدم صحتها، لتتوافق مع ما يتماشى مع ""حزب الأخ الكبير"". يعيش البطل تناقضا كبيرا فهو يعمل للحزب لكنه يكن له عداء شديدا. يقع ونستون في حب جوليا، الأخرى المعادية للحزب لتتغير حياته بعدها.النصف الأول من الرواية ممل بعض الشيء، لكن الرواية تتغير بشكل كبير في النصف الثاني، وتصبح مرعبة خصوصا في الحوارات التي دارت بين وينستون وأوبراين حول ماهية الحقيقة، وكيف يستمد الحزب قوته من جمع المتضادات، وإلغاء المبادئ والقيم وحرفها عن معناها مع ما يتناسب مع الحزب.رواية غاية في العبقرية والإبداع تُقرأ بدقة شديدة، وذلك ليس بغريب على جورج أوريل. "
1512,Diogo Zambujo,"With this book George Orwell provides us a view over both communism and nazism. Hipotheticaly, it shoes the reader, how life would be if England were to fall into a regime jus as the ones pointed above. Winston Smith a worker of the ministery of truth is the main character who lives constantly hating and repulsing the big brother, the head of governament(in secret though, for anyone against the governament misteriously disappears or is vaporized).The book is allways enticing and most of the times will make you think of some choices and even on the reality of human nature. With a closing that let me at least, flabbergasted, 1984 is undeniably a must read."
1513,Teodora Ştefan,"How is it possible that a person who doesn't give a damn to write correctly could have complex political views? And that happens in a society where you are not allowed to think on your own. What is it that makes Winston worth to write about?Except of Winston's incomprehensible intelligence, this book was awesome. I couldn't avoid to think about it through the form communism took in my own country. I've only known capitalism and that was a way to form an idea of what totalitarianism really was (not a great idea, as this book is a dystopia).The lack of food, the lack of information, the absolute truth and the total absence of freedom were things people in Romania had to struggle with. The worst thing about it is that it was not a dystopia, it was reality. Fortunately, people did revolt, things did change..."

1515,Tomas,"Presumably influenced by social and political doctrines in the real world of his own time, Orwell chooses Ingsoc, otherwise known as English Socialism, as the main ideological basis for the Party which is responsible for the dystopia represented in this novel.While it sometimes lacks decent pacing and seems to over-emphasize some ideas and dystopian descriptions and explanations, it captures the reader with brutal narrative, which actually begins at the time when tragedy has already happened, rendering all the present and future happenings just a matter-of-course, a predestined and already known path, though one only finds that out later in the story. And yet, the hope of an alternate ending doesn't seem to leave one's mind, no matter how much weight is being stacked on those who try to oppose."

1517,Lizzie,"Okay, um... wow. Was not expecting that to pack the punch it did.Or rather, I was really hoping it would, and I was not let down. Having read so many YA dystopian books - some good, some not so good - it was refreshing to go back to the roots of the genre. Rather than a Girl Who Is Different From Other Girls who is able to Overthrow The Repressive Government Using Her Super Skills Of Being A Good And Moral Person, we met Joe Bloggs - who, in this instance, is called Winston Smith. He's your average, dull person, and that's what makes this book so chilling. Unlike all those YA books, its purpose is not to empower you and make you feel like You Could Be Katniss Too. We can all identify at least something with Winston, and we feel everything he does.As well as being essentially an essay on politics and sociology, it's an essay on human nature. The things we will and will not do, the things we're afraid of, the things we're willing to fight for, and how far (in this case, there being a limit) we're willing to go for them. How easily we believe things, forget things, persuade ourselves that something is true or not true. And honestly, that is the most terrifying thing about this book."
1518,Stefan,"1984 is defiantly one of the most frightening and depressive novels in the scifi/alternate history genre I was reading to this point. George Orwell creates and throws the reader in a totalitarian state system that is unbearable in its inhumanity, horror filled in its strangeness but somehow instinctively understood and familiar… total surveillance, no privacy in public but at home alike, everyone may be a spy even your own kids are bound to betray you to the party if you deviate from the norm in the lithest and the socalled Thought-police even controls what you are thinking and does many more awful things to manipulate and control the masses but even they are a thiny fraction of the might-apparatus that seems to control and manipulate everything, even such natural things as love, sex and emotion are banned without permission of the party and in persecuted and but to trail… its awesomely written as awe-inspiring and makes you think twice of the fictional world of 1984 and what we have now in present 2012; such things ATCA and the PATRIOT ACT comes to mind… I defiantly recommend this novel but in my opinion the reader should be educated and probably not frightened lightly it’s a really gruesome picture George Orwell is printing on the easel of his book. "
1519,Kimi," Many of you guys had to read 1984 in school at some point, but I hadn’t so I decided to make myself read something useful for once.Hands down one of the best dystopian novels I’ve ever read. “It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.”Nineteen eighty four is about totalitarianism. It basically means that you’ll find a story about a government in which the ruler is an absolute dictator. In this case, the government even tries to control what people think and therefore came the concept of “thought crime.” Big Brother:Big Brother represents the face of the party. The citizens are told that Big Brother is the leader of the party but our main character Winston can never determine whether or not he actually exists. He symbolizes reassurance for most people but in fact the face of big brother is an open threat “one cannot escape his gaze.” Are you a thought criminal? The psychological manipulation is taken to a whole new level in this book. People seem to be brainwashed. They believe whatever the government tells them even if it’s something as stupid as 2+2=5. To commit a thought crime means that you start having some rebellious thoughts against the party and it is severely punished. You’d think that no one can have access to your thoughts, but the truth is that anyone can report you to the thought police even your own children. There’s also the telescreens that watch each and every one of your movements and gestures, and if you as much as breath in a suspicious way, they will catch you. “If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.” Room 101:The room where you’ll meet your worst fears. Room 101 is the proof that any human being can be completely and utterly broken to the point where he would be willing to agree with anything you tell him. 1984 was kind of a creepy read for me because it has a realistic vibe to it. I would highly recommend it to everyone. "
1520,Marietta,"Este libro tiene de todo.Es muchas cosas.Yo soy de Venezuela. Y ya varias personas han dicho que es como si George Orwell hubiera vivido aquí actualmente, y regresado a su época y escrito el libro.Hay mucha relación, y la verdad da algo de miedo, no sé, te perturba. Y es desalentador el final.Algo que yo vi es que el titulo del libro, no es sólo el año en que el protagonista del libro está. Para mí, es como para ocultar el libro, darle menos importancia no sé. De todo lo que es, de la realidad que lo pueden hacer, a mí me pareció que es para ocultarlo (por así decirlo).Hay partes que tuve que releer, es un poco pesado, casi nada, pero hay que darle mucha atención.Cinco estrellas.Qué más puedo decir, no puedo expresarlo bien."

1523,Marmor Owais," It's brainstorming !! ِA novel that we experience in Arab societies. '1984' was written 1948, so it's a kind of prophecy which is applicable till the time being .. I couldn't write anything about it, but it's so deeply and alarmingly true ! ""Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know what no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me.""""How do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works?

1524,Corina Anna,"Reading this book was like being held captive in a world where you experience both the fear of an hostile and depressing environment and the desire to stay and see what happens next. However, the latter is more prominent. The totalitarian society in 1984 functions a bit like the super-ego, that is the seat of conscience. The ID resides completely at the unconscious level of an individ, satisfying its inborn biological instincts. This appetite is considered to be all that is wrong with individuals, thus the need of overpowering it with the super-ego is necessary. The Party manipulates the individ`s super-ego, telling him what is right and what is not. The Thought Police catches all that the super-ego cannot conceal : “The smallest thing could give you away. An unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself—anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide"""
1525,Moira,"""Nechápeš, jaká krása je v ničení slov. Víš, že newspeak je jediný jazyk na světě, jehož slovní zásoba se každým rokem zmenšuje?"" - Tento úryvek mě fascinuje. Nevystihuje sice knihu a příliš ani nenaznačuje, o čem se jedná, přesto mě neuvěřitelně fascinuje. A ke knize:Nemám slov. Já prostě nemám slov.Ten konec byl... dechberoucí. Emotivní. Smutný. Kniha mě dokázala vtáhnout do děje, dokázala ve mně probudit opravdové silné emoce, a já nejenom sledovala děj, ale opravdu živě příběh prožívala. Bylo i pár situací při kterých, navzdory tomu, že jsem věděla, co se stane, ve mně hrklo a já se vyděsila, nechtěla, aby to tak bylo, cítila, jak mi srdce poplašeně buší v hrudi a... 1984 je opravdu dobrý, propracovaný román, ve kterém autor vytvořil svůj vlastní svět - ne svět, ale budoucnost! - a promyslel jej do všech detailů, věnoval se každé maličkosti a vytvořil jej tak uvěřitelně, až se mi ježily vlasy na hlavě. Je to děsivý svět, zkažený a zvrácený. A já se bojím, opravdu bojím, aby naše společnost jednou nedopadla stejně. Vymývání mozků, slepá poslušnost, děsivé chování dětí, nekonečná, zbytečná válka... a další slova v podobném duchu, kterými bych knihu charakterizovala.Co mě na knize fascinuje je neuvěřitelná realističnost, s kterou autor popisuje situace, šokující scény, které se mě doopravdy dotýkají a které děsí. Fascinuje mě i každý nepříliš významný detail, který autor přidává a který dodává příběhu na opravdovosti. I vystihnutí postav zvládl Orwell velmi dobře. Nedokázala jsem se do hlavní postavy úplně vžít, jelikož byla o hodně starší než já a k tomu ještě opačného pohlaví, ale dokázala jsem ji pochopit a chtěla pro něj jen to nejlepší. Jako pro dobrého přítele. Mimo hlavní postavu se důležitěji vyskytují jen dvě další, které byly stejně dobře popsané, a pak ikona Velkého bratra, tváře Strany, která svět ovládá. Byl všude. A stejně je pro mě tak záhadou.Orwell ve své knize uvažuje nad budoucností. Ne tou popsanou v knize, ale tou, jaká by mohla být. A já před ním smekám, jelikož budoucnost taková opravdu je. Není dokonalá, ale v mnoha ohledech se doopravdy shoduje s Orwellovým odhadem. Stejně tak mě ohromily filozofické myšlenky, které Orwell v knize rozpitval.Můžu knihu jenom doporučit. Orwell umí psát a jeho styl se mi zdá poutavý a dobrý, kniha je na povinnou četbu opravdu skvělá. Současným trendem je dystopie, že? Myslím, že tímto románem mám svůj deficit splněný. K ostatnímu - mé hodnocení mluví samo za sebe. Pět hvězd dávám jen knihám, které si to doopravdy zaslouží. A tato kniha mezi ně bezesporu patří. :))"
1526,Michael,"It strikes me each time I read this book, particularly the opening chapter and certain of the more pivotal scenes, how well it is written for what is essentially a polemical tract. The point isn’t really whether Orwell’s vision is realized or realizable, the point is that, while you are in it, he sells it so well. It is also important to remember that 1984 is not a warning about a possible future, but an exploration of Orwell’s contemporary present, magnified to horrific proportions.1984 is a story about relationships. It is the story of Winston’s relationship with Julia, but also and even more importantly, his relationship with O’Brien. It is O’Brien that represents some kind of fantasy comrade-in-arms to him at the beginning (he even says that he is writing his diary to O’Brien), and it is O’Brien that brings him back into the fold by the end. Ultimately, of course, it is a story of the relationships that build up a conformist state. Simplistic political analyses will mistake the State (or “the System”) for a monolithic object, while slightly more critical perspectives will note that it is “made up of people.” A better analysis of oppression realizes that it is based in relationships, and discusses methods for altering relationships in order to reduce oppression. In Orwell’s bleak world, of course, it is impossible to do so, because the relationships are defined within a context which provides no opportunity for new relations to form – all relationships ultimately lead back to the State, in the culmination of the totalitarian dream. Again, this is probably more useful as a reminder of what is possible in a different context than as a warning of a realizable end to freedom."
1527,Chrissa V.,"I just finished reading 1984 and it is now officially one of my favourite books. Orwell’s writing style is modern, minimal and easy to follow; as a result, it never gives you the impression that you are actually reading a book that was written in 1948, 66 years ago.One of the most popular dystopian future novels that were ever written, 1984 presents the reader with a world in which everybody is a slave to the leading party, even the members of the party themselves. People have been turned into beings with no feelings or original thoughts, have been stripped down from all of their rights and are just used as a means to an end. In Jo Brand’s words, 1984 is ""more relevant to today than almost any other book that you can think of"". However, even though some of the techniques described by Orwell have been/are currently being used by political parties all over the world, making 1984 look somehow prophetic, I really disagree with the overall message of the book. I am actually a strong believer of the fact that you can control people’s bodies and you can try control their minds, but you can never smite neither their feelings or their never-ending strive for freedom. 1984 is the first dystopian future novel that I have ever read and even though I’m not a huge fan of fiction, I really, truly loved it. This book is bound to make you think, debate and discuss and that’s good enough reason for everyone to read it!"
1528,Collin Morgan,"This book resonates even today, and Orwell's fictional world warns of the totalitarianism that is pervasive in regimes across the globe. A timeless and unforgiving look at the subjugation that can occur when an apathetic populace grows complacent in its duty to protect freedom."
1529,Vickram E. Diwan,An extraordinary novel that immortalized its author. Stalin's Russia in England. One of my all time favorites it tells the story of the struggle on one man against an oppressive system. It is also a powerful metaphor of the struggle of freedom and sanity over dictatorship and insanity. The Golden country referred in the book is a never land that is accessible to every author in his/her dreams even if he/she does not knows it.
1530,Vivienne,"1984 is a grim portrayal of social control in totalitarian societies - from widespread surveillance to the control of language. It's a powerful, terrifying account of one man's attempt to resist by maintaining his freedom of thought... And his ultimate failure to do so.Newspeak - the official language of the dictatorship - has crept into our own language in the years since publication. I read the book to understand the ideas of doublethink, crimestop, doubleplusungood, crimethink and duckspeak. The book itself is as relevant today as its ever been. Totalitarians are always with us, even as totalitarianism itself mutates into new forms. If you haven't read this book already, do so!"
1531,Dominic,"I heard that 26% of people who claimed to have read 1984 had not, I resolved not to be one of these people. The book is so woven into the cultural and literary consciousness that it was impossible to know, even upon completing it, whether I'd read it before or not. Regardless, I got a great deal out of reading it (or re-reading it). The book is a terrifying master-work, made more terrifying by the obvious parallels to reality. Reading 1984 acutely demonstrates the fact that we are marching headlong and willingly towards the kind of surveillance state that Orwell warns us about. That at every opportunity we gleefully trade our actual freedom for illusory security. That we allow ourselves to succumb to demagoguery. And that we support and fight in wars which we have no hope of winning. But, through the process of double-think, it is easy to be both aware and unaware of these facts, to suppress them from one's consciousness as soon as as that twinge of worry about the current state of politics arises. And that is why reading 1984 again was worthwhile. It forces us, even if for only a moment, to see the state of the world sharply, as the horrifying place that it truly is."
1532,Jeeds Reads,"1984 is a dystopian novel which basically trumps all over any and every other dystopian novel I've read. The world that George Orwell created seems to familar and too real. It is something that could be happening right now and if not I could definitely see happening. This chilling novel depicts society and sticks with you long after reading it.Plot (contains spoilers): In the nutshell this book follows Winston Smith who works in the Ministry of Truth which just basically changes any past articles which may have been wrong or contradicts the current political situation. He does not agree with the system and see's the flaws of that society but one can't just rebel the system and be seen as a martyr. The Thought Police would have caught him because they have screens everywhere and even the wrong facial expression would get them killed. Winston meets Julia, a beautiful young girl who also does not agree with the system and they fall in love and carry out a sordid love affair. Winston assumed that a co worker of his called O'Brien was also a rebel and O'Brien confirmed this as well as confirming the existence of a rebel group and handed Winston a book about the details of the society and how it works. Winston then gets caught by the Thought Police and it turns of that O'Brien works for them. Winston then gets tortured and broken down and continues to say that he will always hate Big Brother ect however the most chilling part was right at the end and Winston's last thought before he got shot was that he loved Big Brother. That showed me how there is enough power to break you down until you believe what they want you to believe which is just haunting. That was a very large nutshell sorryMy book review does not give it justice, but i deeply recommend this book"
1533,Gyda1992_,"""الحرب هي السّلمالحرية هي العبودية الجهل هو القوة ""أخذني وقت طويل لأفهم هذه الجملة لأوريل ، رواية ١٩٨٤ من وجهة نظري أعظم عمل لأوريل و للأدب الحديث بشكل عام ومن فاتته قراءتها فإنه يفوت على نفسه فرصة اقتناء أثمن عمل فكري و أدبي لهذا العصر . هذه الرواية أنصح كل من يهتم بالقراءة أن يقتنيها هي أستقراء لمستقبل غامض وكأنه يتنأ بحالنا اليوم و بمستقبلنا في الغد أو أنه حاول أن يطلعنا بين تلك السطور الغامضة على معاني مجازية مهمة لما يدور خلف ستار هذه المنظمات السياسية . الرواية ستفتح عقلك لآفاق أوسع من ما تتخيل أنك تراها و تفقهها في هذا العالم الصغير. ولا تنسى ""الأخ الكبير يراقبك"" ؛)"
1534,Tasha Bibby,"This is one of my mums favourite books. It wasn't until a friend of mine pointed out that the Muse album ""Resistence"" was written about this book that I decided to give it ago. I wasn't sure what to expect and at this point I hadn't read very many books at all so had little to compare it with but I was blown away. I think the connection with Muse added another level to it for me which heightened my enjoyment of reading it but I was genuinely impressed. Its very advanced for its time and very accurately predicted the society we arguably now live in even if some of the more extreme aspects aren't yet present reality, much of it is. I was throughly impressed and this is now a firm favourite on the shelf."
1535,Rac,"I really enjoyed reading 1984. I had some idea what the book was about but not the details. The first part of the book is mostly about Winston Smith living life in a monitored world where he feels completely alone in knowing that everything is a lie. The 2nd part is about him defying the government for love/sex and joining a underground organization that was dedicated to taking the government down. The third part is the most impressive, it's revealed he was set up and monitored more closely than he thought, he is brainwashed into loving the government only to be killed once his brain is ""pure"" he thinks he can hold onto his sanity and have the final laugh but he doesn't. I felt part of the book was predictable, the secret organization was a set up by the government, what I didn't expect was for him to be brainwashed into loving big brother the ending was the most shocking and different from what I expected because I did think he was going to manage to do his last minute laughs at big brother and corrupt, but he didn't and I loved it. "
1536,Rohit Pahari,"I do not have the audacity to 'review' what is, in my opinion, one of the most important books of the 20th century. Even beyond the nihilism and political commentary, the story itself has exceeded my expectations by far. Doubleplusgood/doubleplusdire."

1540,Leana,I was astonished and scared at the same time. It's really good book about cruel world. I really hope something like this won't happen.
1541,Eliot Hanrio,"It might be the best book I've ever read. It is so powerful, it takes you to the guts, and won't let you indifferent. I would definitely recommend it to anybody who seeks reflexion on society and human nature."
1542,Cooper123,"War is Peace, freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength. This is the slogan for the Party that runs Oceania and the horrible future that it is in. George Orwell’s masterpiece showed what will happen if the people of Earth don't stop fighting and trying to destroy each other. This novel effectively displayed a foreseeable future in which the world is ran by three major powers constantly in a struggle for power. Although that was major point in the book, Orwell was also effectively showing how fragile the human society is and how easily the people as a whole can be changed, without them even knowing. He uses Winston to show how people can have different views than the government, but when they are shared they are quickly squashed and never heard of again. He also uses Winston to show how easy it is to have your mind altered, like when he was made to love Big Brother when in his heart he knew he hated it. This can be seen throughout history, like in Communist Russia and Nazi Germany. Overall I would give this novel 5 stars, for the challenge that it was to read and that it had hidden meaning for the readers to uncover as they went through the book."

1544,Belle Manuel,"This book was so amazing when we read it my freshman year in AP English. It was chilling how Alphas and Betas were a dictation of how to breed, no longer love and relationships developing. It was chilling also as that was when gene selection as getting popular (2008) in modern culture, so we saw how Wells predicted this. Thankfully, child bearing is still (usually) about love. This book gave insight into a totally different society, that isn't too far from what ours could become - DECADES before it was even a thought to doctors. Great read! "
1545,Alice Cardoso,"I started to study the 20th century totalitarien regimes at the same time I started to read 1984. You could say that what happens in the book is completely fake and we could never have such a regime like the one in the book, but what it seems to me is that this is book is a loyal representation of those regimes. They say on the story that their current regime is better than the previous but it is exactly the same.Nineteen Eighty-Four is the perfect insight of how nazism, stalinism or fascism happen and worked.Highly reccomended for people that love history."
1546,Donald Tate,"I found 1984 to be quite a revealing read in regards to what can happen to a society that is too controlled and oppressed-to the point of not even being allowed to fall in love! In this regard, the book is quite depressing at times, but at the same time, it makes me so glad that I don't actually live like this (and hope I never have to!)"
1547,Vishnu," In the future, the three super nations fight for control of the control of the earth... These three nations are Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia. I the midst of all this, Winston Smith works for the English Socialist, or Ingsoc in the government's new language New-speak. Winston hates Ingsoc, so he and his new lover Julia plan to rebel... The book dwells completely on the understanding of politics after World War Two. This is the core of modern politics as we know it. Orwell cautions the earth that sometime in the future, the nations will be obsessed with orthodoxy,as Syme describes ""orthodoxy will be defined by one word, unconsciousness."" The world will be too obsessed with being perfect, realizing the brutal foresight of the Orwellian dystopia."
1548,Brenna Smith,"When reading books in a grade 12 English class you tend to hear a lot of different opinions...most biased due to a dislike in reading. The one thing I noticed a lot was a very basic love vs hate opinion on the book.""You're reading 1984?! I loved that book!""or the more common: ""I hated that book!""Personally, I loved it but I can see why people who don't care for reading would hate it. It's not exactly an easy read, though not overly difficult either. There are a lot of paragraphs in which it seems like the author is trying to add his personal opinions on life and matters about society. Though in this book it works, provoking thought. A lot of people in my class obviously dislike thought provoking books and so dislike this book.I think many people are missing out due to their biased: ""I don't like reading."" You probably don't like reading because you've yet to find the right book. "

1551,Mohamed Magdy zinhom,". رواية صادمة تتحدث عن الديستوبيا او أدب المدينة الفاسدة  رواية كألف .. في كل صفحة من صفحات هذه الرواية كان يساورني شك رهيب أن جورج أورويل حي يرزق .. فرواية كهذه لا يمكن أن تكون قد كتبت عام ١٩٤٨ ... تتحدث الرواية بأدق التفاصيل عن واقع النظام الشمولي الذي نعيشه الآن"".الرواية تصور مجتمع خيالى فاسد و مخيف و غير مرغوب فيه بالمرة حيث يسود الظلم و الاستبداد و القهر و الفساد والسياسى و الكساد الاقتصادى و التلوث البيئى و عدم المساواة الاجتماعية و قمع الحريات بوحشية عن طريق مراقبة الافكار و الايماءات و الهمسات و حتى النظرات من خلال مؤسسة ترمز للفساد و هى الحزب حيث يستخدم جورج اورويل كلمة الحزب ليرمز للحكومة المستبدة فى الرواية .الرواية حافلة بالرمز فبداية من اسم الرواية الذى يحمل فى طياته عبقرية من جورج اورويل حيث اختار عام قريب لعام نشر الرواية الاصلى ليطلق اسمه على عمله الفذ يدل على ان السيناريو الموجود فى روايته غير بعيد و قد يكون سيناريو قريب التحق جدا ان لم يكن تحقق اغلبه فى اغلب الانظمة الحاكمة فى العالم .الرواية التي صورت بطريقة تنبؤية مجتمعا شموليا يخضع لدكتاتورية فئة ، تحكم باسم ""الأخ الكبير"" الذي يمثل الحزب الحاكم ، ويبنى سلطته على القمع والتعذيب وتزوير الوقائع والتاريخ ، باسم الدفاع عن الوطن والبروليتاريا. حزب يحصي على الناس أنفاسهم ويحوّل العلاقات الأنسانية والحب والزواج والعمل والأسرة إلى علاقات مراقبة تجرد الناس من أي تفرد وتخضعهم جميعا لنظام واحد ، لا ينطبق على مسؤولي الحزب.إنها رواية تُقرأ ثم تُقرأ من جديد ..المجتمع الشمولى المرسوم فى الرواية هو عالم يضاهى اسوء الكوابيس التى واجهت البشرية بل هو اشد روعة لان السلطة الحاكمة فى هذا المجتمع سيطرت على الفكر و العقيدة و الاخلاقيات و السلوك و التعليم و الفن و العلاقات الانسانية و حتى اللغة و الكلمات و الحب و الكره و الحقائق .من اهم ما قيل فى الرواية "" إن السلطة ليست وسيلة بل غاية ، فالمرء لا يقيم حكما استبداديا لحماية الثورة، وإنما يشعل الثورة لإقامة حكم استبدادي .. كلما ازداد الحزب قوة قلت درجة تسامحه ، وكلما ضعف معارضو السلطة اشتدت قبضة الاستبداد والطغيان .. من المستحيل ان تؤسس حضارة على الخوف والكراهية والقسوة "" حيث يصور سيطرة النظام الاستبدادى على ثورة لضعف معارضي السلطة بصورة عبقرية مكثفة جدا . إنّ ما يقدّمه جورج أورويل في روايته “1984” هو التصور المحتمل للعالم في اللحظة التي يكون فيها النسيان فعّالًا. هذا النسيان الذي يكرّسه النظام القمعيّ المستبد تجاه الإنسان كهالات فكريّة وذاكرةٍ تاريخيّة وتجريد العقل الذي يناط به الخلقُ والإبداع إلى قوالب آليّةٍ تستمد وقودها من أيديولوجية الحزب الأوحد وحتميّة حب الأخ الكبير.ففي مجتمع يستشري فيه الخوف المستديم من طرف المواطنين لخطرٍ محتمل الوقوع، مجتمع تُصادر فيه الحقوق وتُنتهك الحريّات وتكبت فيه كل محاولة للتفكير. مجتمع الشموليّة والطبقيّة والاستبداد، مجتمع شرطة الفكر والترصد والرقابة والمتناقضات. مجتمعٌ ينتهي به الماضي بالأمس ويجهض فيه الغد. مجتمع مواطنوه بلا ظلٍ ولا أبعاد. تغدو فيه الحياة على نحو رتيب خالٍ من المعنى، مفرغٍ من الحياة. فذي وزاراته الأربع، وزارة الحقيقة التي تزوّر الحقائق وتبتدع الأكاذيب، ووزارة الحب التي تسوم النّاس العذاب وتناهض العلاقة الجنسيّة بالمطلق، وكذا وزارة السلام المختصّة بشؤون الحرب والأسلحة، ووزارة الوفرة التي تعني بتجويع النّاس. وذا “الأخ الكبير” الشخصيّة الغامضة والزعيم الأوّل الذي يأتي في قمّة هرم الحزب يليه أعضاء الحزب الداخليّ فالخارجيّ وأخيرًا عامّة الشعب من الكادحين. أمّا شعارات الحزب فممثلة فيما يلي:“الأخ الكبير يراقبك”“الحرب هي السلام..الحريّة هي العبودية..الجهل هو القّوة”“من يسيطر على الماضي يسيطر على المستقبل، ومن يسيطر على الحاضر يسيطر على الماضي“فى هذا المجتمع الذى يضج بالاستبداد والقمع تظهر رسائل سميث تظهر الجدلية السياسية حول سياسة الحزب لانتهاك الحقوق و الخصوصيات متمثلة فى :شاشات الرصد:يتعلّق الأمر بانتهاك الخصوصيّة وفرض الرقابة بإحصاء أنفاس المواطنين وحركاتهم ومصائرهم وتتبّع منحى تفكيرهم برصد كل ما من شأنه أن يغيّر بوصلة الولاء للأخ الكبير. باستخدام ما استحدث من تقنيات وتكنولوجيات، وبالتالي فنظام الحياة في المجتمع الأوقيانيّ مرهون بجعل الإنسان يعيش تحت هاجس المراقبة الدائمة. تحت شعار: “الأخ الكبير يراقبك”.وهكذا يقول وندستون في مذكراته: “كان عليك أن تعيش بحكم العادة التي تحوّلت إلى غريزة مفترضًا أن كل صوتٍ يصدر عنك مسموع وأن كلّ حركة مرصودة، فالأخ الكبير يراقبك. عيناه تلاحقانك. على العملة، على الطوابع، على أغلفة الكتب على الأعلام، على علب السكاكر، في كل مكان ودائمًا عيناه تراقبانك و صوته يحيط بك وسواء كنت مستيقظًا أو نائمًا، داخل منزلك أو خارجه، في الحمام أو في الفراش، لا فرق.. لا مهرب لك. أنت لا تملك سوى تلك السنتيمترات المكعبة داخل جمجمتك“.التفكير الازدواجي:وهذا النوع من التفكير لا تنطبق عليه خصائص التفكير المنهجيّ الذي يسلّم بالمنطق كمقياس يخضع له الفكر البشري للصواب والخطأ، والذي يحتوي البديهيات كنقاط انطلاق لتكوين خواص جديدة، إلّا أن التفكير الازدواجي يقر بأن “2+2=4″ في حين يقر ثانية أن “2+2=5″ إذا ما ألزم الحزب بذلك، وذلك دون أن تقع الأحكام الصادرة في أيّ تناقض.وبالتالي فازدواجية التفكير هي: “أن تعرف ولا تعرف، أن تعي الحقيقة كاملة ومع ذلك لا تفتأ تقص الأكاذيب محكمة البناء. أن تؤمن برأيين متناقضين وأنت تعرف أنّهما لا يجتمعان، ومع ذلك تصدق بهما، أن تجهض المنطق بالمنطق، أن ترفض الالتزام بالأخلاق فيما أنت واحدٌ من الداعين إليها. أن تعتقد أن الديمقراطية ضربٌ من المستحيل في حين أن الحزب وصيّ عليها. أن تنسى كل ما يتعين عليك نسيانه ثم تستحضره في الذاكرة حينما تمس الحاجة إليه. ثم تنساه مرة ثانية فورًا. فالمفكر الحزبي يعرف الوجهة التي تأخذها ذكرياته عند تغييرها. ويعرف بناءا على ذلك أنه يتلاعب بالحقيقة ولكنّه بممارسة ازدواجية التفكير يقنع نفسه بأنه لم يدنّس الحقيقة، ذلك هو الدهاء الكامل أن تفقد الوعي عن عمد ووعي. وعليه، ففلسفة الحزب لا تنكر صلاحية التجربة فحسب وإنما تنكر أيضًا وبكياسة وجود الحقيقة الظاهرة.”.إجهاض العقل وقتل التفكير:إن المناخ الفكري في عصر الأخ الكبير، في “عالم 1984″ يكون منعدما فيأخذ الصفر كقيمةٍ حديّة عظمى له. في حين يُسيطر الولاء الذي يعني انعدام التفكير، بل انعدام الحاجة إلى التفكير. الولاء هو عدم الوعي. وهذا ما يقزّم دور العقل ويهمّش أهميّته في التجديد ورفض كلّ أشكال التعنّت والطغيان.اللغة والفكر:وفي “عالم 1984″ يتضح مدى البعد السياسيّ في تدمير اللّغة إذ يأتي على لسان أحد شخوص الرواية (سايم) ما يلي:“إننا نقوم بتدمير الكلمات –عشرات بل مئات الكلمات- كل يوم يجري تدميرها، إننا نسلخ اللغة حتى العظام، ألا ترى أن الغاية النهائية للغة الجديدة هي التضييق من آفاق التفكير؟ بحيث تصبح جريمة الفكر في نهاية المطاف جرما مستحيل الوقوع من الناحية النظرية، وذلك لأنه لا توجد كلمات يمكن للمرء من خلالها أن يرتكب هذه الجريمة. فكل مفهوم يحتاج إليه الناس سيتم التعبير عنه بكلمة واحدة محددة المعنى وغير قابلة للتأويل. أما معانيها الفرعية فسيتم طمسها حتى تصبح طي النسيان.فكلّما تناقص عدد الكلمات عامًا بعد عام كلّا يتضاءل مدى الوعي والإدراك شيئا فشيئا. فالثورة تيلغ أوجها حينما تكتمل اللغة ويتم إتقانها.”.وبهذا تتضح أبعاد شعارات الحزب فيما سبق.الرواية التي صورت بطريقة تنبؤية مجتمعا شموليا يخضع لدكتاتورية فئة ، تحكم باسم ""الأخ الكبير"" الذي يمثل الحزب الحاكم ، ويبنى سلطته على القمع والتعذيب وتزوير الوقائع والتاريخ ، باسم الدفاع عن الوطن والبروليتاريا. حزب

1552,Bruce Snell,"Winston Smith works for the Ministry of Truth; his job is changing books and newspapers such that the reporting of events found in places agree with the present. The irony of falsifying history in the name of truth is ignored due to the attitude known as Doublespeak in the official government language of Oceananna. This is a dystopian story of what life is like in a totalitarian future in which the government controls every aspect of the people's lives - especially their thought.I first read 1984 in high school sometime in the 1960s, and it stuck with me forever, giving me a fear of big government that has colored all my political decisions since that time. I read it again in 1984 to mark the year, and noted that although the year had arrived, the oppression was, thankfully, holding off. So, now I have read it again. The year is 2013, and although it has been almost 30 years since 1984, we are closer in spirit today than we were 30 years ago. We have the NSA spying on everyone in the country, we have the IRS stifling free speech, we have a (seemingly) endless war half a world away, and we have a president who seems determined to obliterate freedom and impose socialism - technology has only made the possibility of a government like we see in the book even more possible, and more intrusive.Unlike other dystopian stories, this one ends without a shred of hope; there is no revolution, and Winston is waiting for his execution knowing that Big Brother is right, and loving him for being right. This book does not offer any reason to think things will get better."
1553,Alp Turgut,"""Animal Farm / Hayvan Çiftliği""ndeki akıcı ama sade dilini geliştiren George Orwell'in yine aynı akıcılıkta ama bu sefer usta bir dille okuyucuya sunduğu eseri ""1984"", ""Hayvan Çiftliği""ndeki politik düşünceyi en üst seviyeye taşıyan mükemmel bir politika dersi niteliğinde. Üzerinde fazlasıyla düşünülmüş derin ve felsefi hikayesiyle günümüzde bile hala geçerliliğini koruyan -ve korumaya devam edecek- eserin yarattığı karşı-ütopya dehşet verici olmakla beraber kendine hayran eden metaforik bir gerçekçilik taşıyor. Politikanın güçten ibaret olduğunun ve gücü elinde tutanın ise sadece iktidarı düşündüğünün altını çizen Orwell'in sunduğu hiçbir şeyin 1 veya 0, evet ya da hayır olmadığına dair olan felsefi yaklaşımını bu kitapta da görüyoruz. Yakın tarihte bu yaklaşıma eserlerinde en çok rastladığımız sanatçının ise Christopher Nolan olduğunu söylemekte fayda var. Okudukça kendinizi alamadığınız kitabın ikinci bölümden itibaren başlayan politika dersi niteliğindeki söylemi bile ""1984""ün neden başyapıt olduğunu özetler nitelikte. Tek kelimeyle inanılmaz bir modern klasik!16.01.2015İstanbul, TürkiyeAlp Turgut"
1554,Ömer  TAŞDEMİR,I think this book effected perception of humaninty.
1555,Travis Roberson,"I write this after my second read through. The first time I read 1984, I was either 13 or 14, and I didn't gather everything I should have from it. At that age, I really only understood that ""life sucks for these people because their government watches everything they do and censors everything.""Essentially, that is the main theme of the book. But it's saying something much, much more than just that. This book is such an amazing example of how easily power can be twisted by a governing body until it holds full control upon its citizens. It's often labeled as science fiction, and sure, some of the content featured in the book is a little out-of-this-world, but it leaves you realizing just how deadly power can be and how easily the circumstances in Oceania could become reality in the world, and how they already are.Orwell had something important to say with this. I encourage everyone who hasn't to read this more than once. There is a lot to gather from this book, a lot that you more than likely will not absorb from one read."
1556,Evelin,"This book might start out a little bit slow/dry, and might seem uninteresting. But a couple of chapters in and you will get hooked! This book will make you question everything you ever believed and thought of your government, it will send chills down your spine. And towards the end, YOU WILL FEEL GOOSEBUMPS FROM THE TWIST OF EVENTS!... Scary stuff... The book (When basically stated) shows a totalitarian government at its worst. It teaches many lessons both philosophical and moral. It illustrates how the basic function of cognition or in other words, thinking, could be manipulated and distorted. The government uses wordings/ naming of things in a way to alter the perceptions of its citizens; for ex. 'Victory gin', 'Big Brother', 'Ministry of Love/ Peace/etc.' all these words bring a quasi feeling of prosperity, progress and superiority. Other methods used to control its citizens include: 1.Imaginary war or imaginary enemy (The Party bombs the proles and says its Eurasia = Proles look at the party as a protector, and remember 'desperate times call for desperate measures' is what the party uses as an excuse. )2. Erasing anything historical and killing the elderly, so the people won't have anything to compare their current society/ living standard to, thus not realizing they are living like shit..3. the government uses war as an excuse to make people work hard (Keep them busy= produce more) and instead of distributing the products made, using the military and war needing supply excuse the party manages to keep the inner party members living in luxury and everyone else.. not.. 4. The party takes away the pleasures of the citizens. ex. Sex is made into a disgusting thing= ppl don't have sex (unless want to have loveless brainwashed children who will snitch on their own parents) . and throughout the book you could see how men are always twitching which is b/c the are so suppressed etc. = have so much energy -> The party uses that energy to put the citizens (Not the proles) at work. 5. The party destroys language since language forms thought... the party wants to control people's thoughts.. Other methods are used such as constant surveillance and whatnot.. But what really gave me the chills were the convincing distortions of rational thought and how different perspectives (Don't want to spoil) although clearly are false, could be believable (if you were living in oceania.. if you were brainwashed by the party..).. The book has too many twists in it and deep thoughts, that I can't even start listing.. Reading this you will start questioning your own morals,""Is it okay to do bad for the greater good?"" ""Is it okay to do good for bad?"" ""confession is not betrayal?"" ""Would you kill to save a life?"" ""Would you demoralize to revive humanity?"" ...OKAY I'M GONNA STOP HERE.. JUST READ THE BOOK, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON MANY THINGS... "
1557,Pedro António,"I stared at the blinking cursor for a the longest time, trying to come up with a way to sum up my thoughts on 1984 and I honestly don't think I can put into words what it made me feel.Throughout the whole book my beliefs kept being challenged, my feelings played with. As things get progressively darker you keep hoping from the bottom of your heart that they improve, though it never gets to the point where you're just hopeless, because the book is written in a way where you feel like you live in this dystopian society and you can't just stay put and accept it as it is.I generally don't care much about politics, but I think it'd be impossible not to feel involved with the politics present in 1984. Very few books made me feel as angry, as sad and as hopeful as 1984 did at various points. Some of the exposition is a bit long, but it never felt like it was slowing the pace down or like filler.One of the hardest things to wrap my head around was the fact that the book was written over 60 years ago, yet the vast majority of it remains remarkably up to date. Sure, a bit of the technology feels a bit silly, but pretty much everything else is spot on.If you want a book that'll leave you thinking for hours on end after finishing it, I honestly can't recommend 1984 enough. Whether you're into politics or not, I think everyone owes it to themselves to read 1984. I couldn't possibly hope to do it justice, but it's definitely one of the best books I've ever read and it's almost embarassing it took me this long to actually read it!"
1558,mai ahmd,من أجمل الروايات السياسية التي قرأتها في حياتي كتابة ساخرة عن النظم الديكتاتورية وطريقتها لتغييب عقول البشر 
1559,Sheany,"I still can't wrap my head around the fact that the protagonist didn't prevail. What is survival under oppression?Furthermore, what is obedience in oppression - the worst, I'd say. Of course I didn't expect the story to make this sort of turn. It's absolutely unpredictable - especially in the modern literature sense, where you get this array of dystopian novels where the characters more or less survive after a series of hardships. It gives you a different edge to the whole theme of a dystopian world, and makes you wonder why or how George Orwell was initially moved/inspired to write in the first place. I'd definitely have to do some research, as I almost always do right after a good book. On a completely personal note - have I grown old and emotionless that I didn't really feel 'anything' after this book? Which also happened with 'A Visit from the Goon Squad' by the way. I'm trying to be positive and conclude that it's only because I just enjoy happy endings. Back to topic, though. It is terrifying to read about a character such as O'Brien, and that from Winston's perspective. It leaves me with an eerie feeling of being deranged. The beliefs of the Party, or philosophies if you will, were just bizarre - and more so because I do not think it is impossible in the realistic world at all. Twisting someone's mind isn't entirely that difficult, I've seen it being done all the time - and how do we keep the integrity of one's character, mind and soul? It seems impossible in a world of cruelty and thirst for power. Honestly, aren't we all partly brainwashed already at this point? All these aspects are what makes 1984 worthy of five stars. It isn't just that Orwell is a wonderful writer, it is how he form his thoughts and deliver his story that makes this read one of the most unique experience I've had. I wouldn't say it's the best, but I didn't feel like I was robbed off of anything (like what happens with most 'less than good' books). I definitely recommend this one if you like a brain-teaser! "
1560,Samuel,"La guerre c'est la paixla liberté c'est l'esclavagel'ignorance c'est la forceAprès quelques années à me dire qu'il faudrait bien que je lise ce classique, j'ai fini par le lire (j'ai souvenir de l'avoir commencé il y a plusieurs années et de ne point l'avoir lu plus loin que le premier chapitre). Ce livre est magistral par sa capacité à être toujours d'actualité et ce, plus de 50 ans après son écriture. Il requestionne les questions de pouvoir, de guerre, de liberté, etc. Il est un puissant outil de réflexion sur notre système politique actuel et sur la façon dont la société est organisée. Un livre à lire et à relire (car les sens cachés sont multiples!)"
1561,Nelle,Definitely a must read. 
1562,Jeffrey Dill,My favorite book.
1563,Tessmo,"Brilliant, visionary, work of a genus humanist and philosopher, that is my first opinion.All my previous 5 stars rating give me no room for this one! Should I change all my previous?The feeling of inadequacy of my writing is overwhelming me once again. I wish I have the ability to voice my opinion of this …Great, wonderful, horrible, eye-opening, self-examining…(Insert the appropriate word, because my vocabulary is too poor) Book.It felt so real that it is frightening.The 'telescreens' (the book is from 1948!)- I remember affair when pupils at school received free computers to learn lately, that had spied on them transmitting video to principals of the school'The Physical Jerks' (forced exercise - nothing to do with todays obesity problems) ‘Come on comrades; put a bit of life into it!’... Winston... 'succeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the first time in sevaral years.'From real life:Corporations – increase of 50 % of work load didn’t so far cause a strike of working class (bad economy excuse) I do not want to believe it is self-fulfilled prophecy for human kind, but….It is very very scary even now."
1564,Chase Von,"Unlike a lot of people who were told to read this in High School, I didn't learn of it until a few brief years ago. I'd heard of it, but didn't really ""get"" why so many people were blown away by it. Then I read it and have since made it a point to get my hands on everything this man had ever written! George Orwell was no doubt a genius, visionary, prophet and a definite priceless gift to all of humanity. 1984 written in the late 1940's, (I see 1949 in my book, but I don't want to nail down a date as there have been reprints), someone else here has stated 1948 which if so, is still incredibly beyond remarkable because what he describes is something that sounds so much like the world we currently live in today, and the potential for it to be this world which he describes? Well, unfortunately the means are in fact all present now. We can be observed pretty much around the clock from when we leave our homes until we arrive. With what can be done with cell phones, GPS etc but I won't go into what should already be quite obvious to all. The fact of the matter is he foretold with pin point accuracy just how things could be and the frightening thing is many of these things are in my opinion in affect. New Speak, Thought Police, War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength, Big Brother and countless other things he writes about ring with such an eery realness one has to wonder if he time traveled into our present day and perhaps slightly beyond and then returned to his time to write about it to truly warn us what was at stake. I won't tell the story, as George does that exceptionally well to the point where you feel as if you are seeing this ""World"" he paints through the eyes of the main character ""Winston"". So much so that even though it was written years ago, it reads as if in many cases it could have been written today, or yesterday. Like Gene Rodenbury's Star Trek, George Orwell's 1984 is definitely light years ahead of its time. I don't think this book can be recommended highly enough to those who have not yet read it. Nor do five stars even remotely come close to giving this Master Piece it's due credit. Your Chance to Hear The Last Panther Speak "

1567,Sara J 240511,"This book is phenomenal, and it really opened my eyes to some extend. His conjecture about the future was flabbergasting. And was really runs in my thoughts were the notion and the collaborations of this book. Can it ever come to reality? And if it does, who could possibly imagine how it is going to be like. This dystopia has two mingled factors,totalitarian government along with history. As I quote "" Big Brother"", this concept is already building up in out current society. Furthermore, the book was aggrieving, yet utterly intellectual. "
1568,Owain Jones," 1984 is at once an incredible tale of the past, present & future. It takes moments of the now, makes them the yesteryear, and turns the now into the future. To control the past is to control the now. You do not need to work to control tomorrow because you already control yesterday. The past is fluid. The past changes. There is no physical time. Love is subjective, and there is no such thing as bad. Hate is love. War is peace. Slavery is freedom. __________________If you haven't read this book and don't want to be utterly confused; don't read it. But if you want to read something that will make you think every minute of every page; read it now - because tomorrow it may be a different book entirely. "
1569,Samantha Lozano,"I recently read the book 1984 by George Orwell a wonderfully interesting book displaying a possible future from a 1949 perspective. The main character Winston, is deeply troubled by the current society and government, which is ruled by a single party and controlled by the ominous Big Brother, that hides the truth from its citizens, redefines reality, and imposes rules that prohibit independent thought. When Winston is betrayed by someone he formerly thought of as an ally and brutally tortured, he resigns himself to believing the lies of the singular party and begins to find comfort in the totalitarian figure of Big Brother. One of the reasons why I loved 1984 unconventional plot line. Most dystopian novels begin with a general dislike of the government that then morphs into a deep seeded hatred for it and ends with a successful large scale rebellion. 1984 did no such thing. Winston's attitude at the beginning of the book began as a hate for the party and their policy. Now while there's no doubt that his feelings become more complex and nuanced throughout the course of the story, the ending is very much the opposite of a successful rebellion and rather a broken acceptance of defeat. Another reason why I loved 1984, was how relevant it was to modern day society. We antagonize many of the major elements of the world in the book, like the lack of privacy, which is an issue we face today in our society. This made it incredibly interesting to read and to later discuss as the problems of the fictional world aligned with those of the real world.Overall, I loved 1984 because of its uniqueness and relevance."
1570,Kenneth Shu,"1984 is the dystopian classic about a parallel universe in which despotic autocracy has seized absolute control over society, the personification of what would have happened if another party joined WWI against the Triple Entente and the Central powers, resulting in a quandary stalemate that would last for decades. The book guides the audience in the perspective of Winston Smith, a forlorn bourgeoisie serving the totalitarian Oceanic government as he slowly dissipates into obscurity and duress. There, one would witness him as slowly begins to unravel the truth behind life, adapting and challenging the very poison that reduced the world to the callous state of deceit and corruption, of war and suffering.Personally I would recommend this book for fanatics of Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury because its cunning and intriguing, and it brings perspective in a unique way. Yet I wouldn’t recommend this book for those who crave for action and war, for this book details the quaint yet miserable life of common middle class savant as he strives for survival in an inhospitable world of stark despair and death. I adore this book because of the suspense and paranoia it instills amongst its readers. Every moment, every paragraph of every chapter, there would be aspects of enigma and curiosity, of moments where the reader questions the ‘what’. It is this impalpable understanding of the ‘next’ and the spontaneity of the narrative that truly makes this a must read novel for all."
1571,Mete Rodoper,"George Orwell describes the year 1984 in his novel written in 1948. The future he describes is based on a totalitarian regime and ruled by the Big Brother and the party. Simply, individualism is suppressed and the party is in charge of every aspect of people's lives. All media, education is controlled and even more people are being watched through telescreens constantly to make sure they are behaving as expecteed. Beyond these, social engineering is in place and people's thought are redesigned. Individual thinking and questioning are banned. There is no certain past but only present and and written history. Our main character tries to question his system and goes over all the kind of issues.George Orwell makes an amazing piece of writing and imagines a period in human life which might hold through in its some aspects some time in the future. His analysis of his current time and projection into future and his complete storytelling makes this book a must-read, mind-blowing experience. Towards to the end of the book, you cannot know how the main character will end up being and his terrifying experience connects you to this book. At the end of this novel, you will definitely add to yourself and you will definitely have many phrases, propaganda lines, scenes stick to your mind forever. Magnificent classical work. "
1572,Jim Adolphson,"“BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU”. These words got under my skin as I read 1984 by George Orwell. In this book, the author goes in depth about a totalitarian society, where information that is transmitted in any way to the public is intercepted through governmental strategies and forces. The governmental party or “big brother” as it has been continually referred to throughout the story, is “always watching” the society it govern’s to make sure that they are not breaking any of the laws that are set in place. The main character Winston Smith develops a strong hatred towards this system as the story unfolds, leading him into a state of defiance and law breaking. In the book, Winston has a forbidden love affair with his girlfriend, Julia. The affair is forbidden, because the government forbids two people to be in love. There are leagues of men called the thought police, who are able to read the thoughts of the citizens in the city where the book takes place, Oceania. This disturbing tale of the extreme invasion of privacy, goes places that most book’s I have read to not tend to go for the simple reason that at times, it feels like real life. Overall, the story is about the fight against the sending and receiving of information, and the interceptions that may occur to deter one from hearing the whole truth and nothing but the truth. It seems that primary, secondary, and tertiary sources do not consistently exist for the main character’s to gain new knowledge. Every time Winston seems to grasp a new concept of how things are and how he can get around it, he is intercepted by the government to ensure that he doesn’t know too much. Orwell really goes in depth about the accessing of information and the way that people can perceive things, while also letting us take an even closer look at the way that interception of important information can occur to individuals all over the world. There is a sense of an anti-governmental stance. It seems that Orwell had a personal issue with the way his country was ran when this was written, and he just simply will not let it go. I found this plot to be extremely tightly constructed, with no holes to be poked in its plot at all. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who feel’s like they have at one time or another been betrayed by something or someone that they put their trust into for the simple reason of, “thats just the way it is”. 1984 made me take a closer look at the things I deal with each day of my life, and the information I am given. I feel like Orwell’s main objective in this book was to make the people of the world to examine everything a lot closer than they previously had been in the 30’s and 20’s. Truly a first look at radicalism towards government and gaining facts on our own through our own experiences."

1574,Kalyn,"Unlike many other people, I did not have the pleasure of reading this novel in high school. I did have the opportunity in the middle of my post-secondary career to pick it up, but I was much too busy to be reading novels then. Finally, as a full-time working member of society, I decided to pick it up and read it, graciously loaned to me by a colleague. I am ashamed to admit that it has taken me so long to read it, but after picking it up I could hardly put it down! Granted, the Penguin Books version is rather small in terms of dimension, but the flow was astounding!The book tests what we know about modern life through Newspeak and the basis of government. As a reader, you have to decide whether it is a utopian or dystopian society. That is one of the best questions to ask yourself as you are reading it. "
1575,Denis Berman,"What a fantastic book! Every high school should pursue this great writing in its classrooms. But the question is would they? This is an eye-opener! It reveals the controlling world that we live in and schools are just another institution. According to Aldous Huxley, schools are institutions that are in fact prisons. Indeed, Huxley and Orwell meet at many crossroads when the way of thought considered. But, this is not a Huxley book. This is the best of George Orwell. From 'newspeak' to mind control, Uncle Sam will break you down until you have no personality left. I think a large amount of people would agree with that statement. In this book, Orwell predicts life in the year 1984. It is about us becoming zombies, robots, clones, etc for the powers of B. These powers you will never really get to know. They will torture you, torment you, and brainwash you until you become what they want you to be. Genius isn't it? This book is a must read for anybody who wishes to liberate their mind from mental slavery. What a great start! Open your eyes and see what is happening in the world and you will be seeing '1984' each and every day. Can pleasure exist without pain? To the powers that we will never get to personally know, the answer is: no. Although pleasure is just an agreeable sensation, the other guy insists the introduction of pain. We must resist and that is what the main protagonist (Winston Smith) of this novel did. How did he do it? Well you must read the book to find out or else you would have known if you have read it. However, it is one of those books that need to be read a few times to be fully understood. Certainly, there are many doors of perception hidden in this story. Rereading this book will open some more of them and enlighten you about the path humanity is following. Which is the ultimate self-destruction we have ever seen and that is losing our character as human beings to what? We exactly will never know but thankfully, Orwell is here to open our eyes and help us understand that we are falling apart to a grand master, a small group of people that can do whatever they want and control us like sheep. 5 star book, guaranteed pleasure for the begging right to the very end."
1576,John Goodell,"A haunting, timeless novel that offers us a very real warning about where society could be heading. I finally got around to reading this classic after having read several other dystopic novels by authors such as Zamyatin and Burgess. Of all the books I've ever read though, this may be the most truly harrowing, and not in the classic suspense/horror sense of the word, but rather because of the truth behind what Orwell writes and its relevance to our own society.I found myself thinking about totalitarian regimes that have existed in the time since this book was published. The Khmer Rouge employed some of the most extreme methods of thought control by effectively eradicating the intricate Khmer culture Cambodians had improved upon for centuries. Pol Pot and his cronies veiled their crimes and efforts for a solid four years while the outside world looked on completely unaware to what was happening inside Cambodia. Sweden even sent their own delegates on diplomatic visits to the Cambodia during this time, where they were greeted with open arms and treated with the utmost honor by the regime, who of course never showed them the killing fields or prison camps rampant throughout the country. Obviously, Mao's cultural revolution was also similar in many ways, and can be paralleled extensively with the super bloc powers of 1984. At the risk of examining deeper some of these other repressive regimes I do not know enough about, I will just finish by saying that it does not take much effort to uncover such referenced regimes in parts of the world both western and not. Take for instance, some of the rhetoric being used today in the 2016 presidential race and relate it to Orwell's forebodings in 1984. Frightening indeed..."
1577,El,"This book was the first in the long time to have me shouting for the main character, Winston. It is truly -the- classic dystopian novel with a deeply fleshed out world and complicated but accessible political system. There was no distance between myself and the events of the book - when the protagonists were in trouble, I was feeling pure fear for them. Even in the very beginning where Winston begins his inevitable downfall (by his own realisation), I felt an overwhelming joy for this particularly ordinary fellow who decided to begin recording his blasphemous thoughts in a diary. A plain act built up successfully by Orwell to be utterly revolutionary. The only criticism I can make of this book is where, in the middle, things slow down quite a bit during the romance portion of the novel. Otherwise, the penultimate chapters more than make up for this slightly dull section of the novel and contain such wildly exciting yet terrifying ideas that I sometimes pick up 1984 again just to hear the chilling voice of O'Brien in my head. It is a shame that Orwell died so young, but fortunate that he lived long enough to give us 1984 and Animal Farm."
1578,Gary Hoggatt,"1984 is, quite simply, one of my favorite books. I first read it when selecting a book for a high school English class project, and have re-read it every few years ever since. George Orwell's 1949 novel never fails to move me, scare me, worry me, or draw me in. This reading, I listened to it on audiobook for the first time, an experience I highly recommend.As most know, 1984 is a dystopian novel - the English language dystopian novel to many (one of these days, I've got to read Russian author Yevgeny Zamyatin's We, which preceded 1984). Set in the oppressive future of 1984 in London, the major city of Airstrip One (formerly England), the novel chronicles the efforts of everyman Winston Smith to defy the omnipotent ruling Party of Oceania, the principles of Ingsoc (English Socialism), and - most especially - the ever-present, omniscient gaze of Big Brother, the symbol and embodiment of the system itself.Smith begins to rebel in various ways, in particular with his lover Julia. Merely loving anyone but Big Brother is itself a crime. Winston and Julia carry on their relationship, both out of feelings for each other and to break the rules they despise. Eventually, of course, they are arrested by the Thought Police, since - after all - Big Brother Is Watching. Taken to the Ministry of Love for re-education, Winston learns what the Party is really after.Many of the elements of the novel have become concerns for modern times, especially with technological innovations that have made Orwell's science fiction science reality. Surveillance, censorship, perpetual war, manufactured patriotism, control of the language, exploitation of the middle classes. Orwell drew much of his inspiration from the Soviet Union, but it's easy to find examples of all these concerns in the front page of your local newspaper on a daily basis.As much as the technology is terrifying, the truly disturbing part of 1984 is in the mind of our hero, Winston. His struggle to remain himself while being both figuratively and literally, mentally and physically, beaten down by the apparatus of the party is gut-wrenching, as is the final result of the struggle. The last line of the book is one of - perhaps the most - powerful I've ever read.As I stated above, this was the first time I've listened to 1984 as an audiobook. I listened to Blackstone Audio's 2007 production, narrated by Simon Prebble. Prebble is a favorite of mine, and he's at his best here. There's a certain gravity to Prebble's voice that invests his work with a power that, while enjoyable in other books, is vital here to reflect the spirit of the novel. Winston's struggles, hopes, sufferings, all are brought to vivid, grim life by Prebble's strong narration. I highly recommend Prebble's reading to anyone looking to listen to 1984. The production runs approximately 11.5 hours.1984 is a classic. I cannot recommend Orwell's masterpiece enough. Though 1984 has come and gone, Orwell's powerful warning remains timeless."

1580,Boston,"This is the kind of novel that you don't really want to read when your teacher tells you it's required work. You read 20 pages and decide you hate it but persevere because you know you'll eventually have to write an essay on it. But then it really shakes you to the core when you finally get into it. It is brilliant, it is frightening, it is unbelievably relatable and the events are actually coming true. 1984 is one of the books that I can honestly say changed me forever. Sure, Winston, the main character is a little flat, but that's the whole point. He has been rubbed raw by the insane society that Orwell created. This book is not character driven, so character lovers, beware: this book is not for you. It is completely society and plot driven and I loved every minute of it.Brief idea of what this novel is about: Winston Smith is a regular guy living in the totalitarian society of Oceania - a place of consistent war, omnipresent government surveillance (Big Brother is watching...) and public mind control. You can be punished for even thinking the wrong thing (thoughtcrime); the public lives in an eternal state of fear and blandness. Winston works for the Ministry of Truth (MiniTru) and is responsible for re-writing old newspaper articles in order to make them fit with the Party (the government's) current views. He is a perfect citizen until he meets Julia, an undercover rebel with an agenda. Does any of that sound familiar? Because it's startilingly similar to what our current society is turning into.Did I convince you? I hope so. Please don't think that just because it is a classic it's dull - it really isn't. And I wouldn't lie (even if Big Brother was watching). "
1581,Veni Johanna,"George Orwell wrote about his dystopian vision - an autocratic world where privacy and independence do not exist - with great detail and deep thoughts. This is a world where there is no free will and no real relationship, where past is manipulated, sexual needs are repressed, and people are brainwashed... Scary look of a (possible) future, as it borrows a lot from Hitler's regime in Germany. Simply a masterpiece."
1582,Ebru,"Man sagt dieses Buch sei nicht ""eine"" Dystopie, sondern ""DIE"" Dystopie. Dementsprechend traurig ist es, dass man sich bei manchen Forderungen einiger politischer Vertreter zunehmend die Frage stellen muss, ob das Buch wirklich so utopisch ist. Wenn wir nämlich nicht aufpassen und uns nicht ab und an vor Augen halten, wie unser Alltag im schlimmsten Falle aussehen könnte, kann es schnell dazu kommen, dass wir leichtsinnig große Teile unserer Freiheit abgeben.Meiner Meinung nach eines der wenigen Bücher, die man gelesen haben muss. Spannend von der ersten Seite an. Ein Buch, welches man zwar weglegen, aber nicht aus dem Gedächtnis löschen kann. Auch heute noch habe ich Gänsehaut, wenn ich daran denke."

1586,Will Hillier,"George Orwell's dystopian vision of a totalitarian socialist regime makes for a terrifying read. The fact that I hadn't read it until I was well into my adult life is largely due to its reputation as an enthusiasm-killing tickbox on the national curriculum. While I can't lie - it was hard going - it is still undoubtedly a must for any bookshelf, and I would challenge even the most apolitical individual not to reassess their interest in politics after reading it. 1984 is at times confusing, frightening, boring and paranoia-inducing. However, even though it seems like an unlikely possibility, it is worryingly easy to imagine our current society progressing towards this sort of terrifying future if we become complacent about politics. This is particularly with the dawn of the Internet, which feels very in keeping with the book's message that the written history is the accepted one, even though it can be altered over and over again. Despite having to put it down and pick it up over the course of several months, it would not be exaggerating to say that this book changed my life."
1587,Palash Bansal,"One often comes across the argument that it is in the interest of the power-holders to keep their subjects ignorant and busy in their limited cocoons. For if they become literate, intelligent and develops an understanding of the world, the power-holders will no longer be required and would be pushed out of existence.This book has dealt precisely with this argument. It is spell bounding to read how limited the sphere of independent thought had been reduced to. The people were transformed into machines with no escape to anything humane. It was horrific to picturize the character of Smith who inspite of having a rebellious intellect was finally made to succumb to the pressure of the party. His notion that 'sanity is not statistical' was shattered by the physical and mental torture he was subjected to. The author made it look so convenient to keep the public busy with smaller issues while keeping them indifferent towards the bigger picture. Thus was done by not providing them with a reference to compare with. Restricting their vision, capturing their ideological freedom, treating thoughts equal to deeds, entering their very psyche. An analogy provided was so apt - ants were only able to see the smaller objects and ignored the bigger ones. A perfect book which would force a person to think whether he/she is actually able to sense the flow of the wind or is just carried away unknowingly by its force."
1588,Hugh,"This book is a classic, and a must read. Some of it may appear dated now, almost 100 years from its inception, but other parts of it are still prophetic today."
1589,Spider the Doof Warrior,"It is odd that the Big Brother is Watching you aspect of this story bothers me less than the concept of this entire society being based on human misery. On turning pleasurable things like sex, being connected to family and friends, language, anything that is good and makes like worth living into horror and hell. That drives me crazy. What is the point of making life so miserable for so many people? What does this party even have to gain from turning people into complacent sheep that allow this to happen and do nothing to stop it, nothing to rebel against it?It's deeply depressing."
1590,Miquixote,"Big Brother is still watching us, but in a much more efficient manner, and we still don't get that Orwell wasn't talking about the future, he was talking about the present. My only complaint with this book is that it was too metaphorical. His introductory essay explained it all, but it wasn't allowed into print. People think it is only about Stalin-type dictatorships. Orwell didn't intend that understanding but that is what he got. I am sure if people knew what he really meant, they wouldn't like it as much. I would like it even more if people could somehow get the correct message from it. Still one of the best classic novels, and can be used as a stepping stone to trying to truly understand dictatorial processes.I heard somewhere that some schools are trying to take it off the curriculum. Should never happen, this book is fundamental to western culture. Superior to Animal Farm, partly because it is prophetic about Western types of mass-surveillance and historical deletion. It is however seriously depressing. In case you doubt about mass surveillance and historical deletion occuring today and how it applies to Western culture, read 'Killing Hope' by William Blum (a history of the CIA since World War II). "
1591,Keisha,"In a world administered by totalitarianism government, a man with the courage to break into his own suffers for freedom to live and love. Winston Smith, a feeble, observant man carries on with life being forced to abide by Big Brothers strict supremacy. In 1984, the world was divided into three: Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia with each continent war torn and weary against one another in the fight for total power over the whole world. Eastasia, AIRSTRIP 1 in England is the setting of the book where a single political figure that may or may not exist holds the entire country in fear to be anything other than brain washed zombies living in an ignorant bliss. In this world every face, sound, and move made is being monitored and recorded by the thought police The pressing thing is, any one wrong move can get you killed .Winston lives among the millions of compliant civilians in AIRSTRIP 1. He goes to work as a party member in the Ministry of Truth altering historical records to match the parties version of history. At work, or for that matter, anywhere that is directly related to the ministries there are monitors called telescreens that are used to convey messages to employees. They are also used for spying on ministry workers, waiting for them to display thought crime so they can be stolen or murdered during the night. Winston knows how he lives, he remembers from his childhood how things were before Big Brother was ever a forced life style. Before loving and laughing could get you killed and before the war had even started. His memory is worn from the repetitive life that he leads and he may be missing spaces of time but you can never truly forget the feeling of happiness.Winston leads a repetitive life so when something out of the ordinary happens such as a fellow co-worker named O’Brien giving him a certain indescribable countenance, he notices. Day after day Winston and O'Brien pass each other at work and exchange the same quick meaningless glances. If observed by the telesceen close enough, they would be guilty of committing organized conspiracy against the party. Are the glances really meaningless though? Years pass of the same behavior and Winston finally recognizes a furtive understanding being hinted towards him. It seems so ridiculous to try for years to convince another that your tendency to stare was something much deeper than what he could have imagined. Besides O’Brien, there is also another character that has shaken Winston. Julia, an aggressive, enthusiastic Anti-Sex league representative seems to always be around advocating the strict no sex policy.He hated her with a passion. He hated her so tremendously that whenever she came around, the varicose ulcer on his left ankle would become inflamed and he would scratch it raw. The way she flaunted the fact that she was chastised and encouraged others to be lonely, detached people made him sick. He wasn’t opposed to chastity, he was opposed to what the party had made the definition of marriage into. How they changed relationships into a business. They dont want you to love, they want you to make babies and train them to worship Big Brother. Winston felt that she was taunting him with her beauty, teasing the fact that she would never imagine to be with some one like him. He hated it all, everything about her. As time passed, he became intently interested in her and the unimaginable happened...."
1592,Kayl Karadjian,"Wow, where to begin? This novel was special in so many ways, and it is one of those books that you can never just read it once. Some things you miss and catch on your second, third, and fourth reads.This novel speaks to many because of what we are seeing around us and what we have seen at certain points in history. Big brother is a scary thought, and an authoritarian government is a fear that people are always worried about. Some would say we've already hit that point. Who knows.Orwell captivates the reader by showing a character who finds himself trying to fight back against the regime. Little does he know his efforts are completely in vain, and the truly horrifying part of the book is the process in which he is essentially tortured and turned into exactly what the government wants him to be. In the end, he was a part of the machine all along."
1593,Bharat,"I think therefore I am...Thinking is central to the idea of man - the ability to discern and question is what sets us apart....this book is a dystopia, a peek into 'Oceania' a totalitarian regime premised on total mental dictatorship of it's people - to the extent of reducing men to robots on an assembly line....where a man is deprived of the most important of his abilities...the power to think ! The power to doubt, question and express. How the power to think is crushed and unremitting loyality by a dictator is brought about by skillful manipulation of history (Control of the past - to control the future) and re-coding of language to muzzle dissent. The chilling portrait of the insidious STATE would send shivers down ones spine and and make one value a democratic state more than ever. It's sheer arrogance to go about life having not read this book...."
1594,Leila Hashemi,"وقتی شروع به خوندن کردم صفحه های اول کتاب شدید منو یاد کتاب ""میرا""انداخت ولی این کتاب موضوع واقعی تر و مفصل تر و خیلی قوی تری داره.کتاب 3 بخش داره که در مورد سخصیتی به اسم وینتسون هست تو کشوری زندگی میکنه که تمام مردم شهر با تله اسکرین کنترل میشن و شخصی به اسم ناظر کبیر تمام رفتار و حرکت اونها رو زیر نظر داره .کل داستان تم سیاسی داره .برای من که خیلی جذاب بود مخصوصا بخش آخر اتاق 101و...با اینکه به ظاهر پایان تلخی داشت ولی بنظرم هیچ کس نمیتونه فکر عقیده و نظری که آدما تو ذهنشون دارن تغییر بده حتی وینستون.این کار را نمیتوانند بکنند.تنها چیزی هست که نمیتوانند بکنند.میتوانند آدم را وادار به گفتن هر چیزی بکنند،اما نمیتوانند وادارش کنند که باورش کند.نمیتوانند به درون او وارد شوندوینتسون اندکی امیدوارانه گفت:نه نه کاملا درست است نمیتوانند به درون آدم وارد شوند.اگر بتوانی احساس کنی انسان ماندن ارزش دارد،حتی اگر نتیجه ای هم از پی نداشته باشد،آنها را شکست داده ای.ه"
1595,Saba,"I had to read this for school in twelfth grade, and probably wouldn't have touched it otherwise, but I was surprised by how accessible I found it (or maybe that's just me not looking closely enough). Definitely one of the most powerful books I've ever read. I still think the moment when Winston and Julia get discovered is one of the most haunting/freaky/plain awesome (for lack of a more expressive way to phrase it) moments in literature, though I'm definitely not a qualified judge on that front. I don't know if Orwell meant it as a realistic prediction of where he thought the world would be towards the end of the twentieth century, or just a cautionary account of what could happen in the vague future if political conditions were allowed to escalate to such an extreme, but if it's the former, I think it's a testament to how wrapped up in the horrible present people can get when things seem bleak, so much so that all that they can imagine is more of the same and worse, kind of like a depressed person. It's encouraging to realize that the future almost always surprises us, sometimes pleasantly. Which is not to say that the world today is all rainbows and unicorns, but I think the we're at least in a better place than Orwell had predicted in 1948."
1596,Christina Wilder,
1597,Ryan Sweeney,"1984 by George Orwell, takes place in a dystopian future in which society is now ruled by a tyrannical government called 'The Party' and their omnipotent figurehead 'Big Brother'. The world as we know it has been has been separated into three separate Superpowers: Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia. These three superpowers are in a perpetual state of war with each other, resulting in a society based on hatred and fear which is again divided into three separate social standings: 'The Inner Party', 'The Outer Party' and 'The Proles' - In current terms, these three can be looked upon as Upper, Middle and Lower class (with Proles being the latter). Winston Smith is employed as a productive member of the Outer Party. As is common, his parents and younger sister vanished at a young age, and it's assumed they were killed due to crimes against the party. The party controls all aspects of modern life, any attempts to act out against them is almost certainly punished by death. All communication and thought is monitored using two way telescreens which act simultaneously as both a monitoring and information system. Anything which isn't picked up by the telescreens is monitored by the mysterious 'thought police' who are hidden as members of the public and charged with monitoring rebellious thought.Winston becomes increasingly disillusioned with society and longs for freedom, he secretly begins writing his opinion of the Party in a diary away from view of the telescreens. Eventually he meets a girl called Julia with similar opinions and together they begin an illegal love affair, trying to keep it hidden from The Party and Big Brother.This book is fantastic. It's dark, gripping, descriptive and tense. I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked it up, all I knew about it was of the notorious 'Big Brother' which has now become a pop culture icon, representing a perceived loss of privacy. Considering 1984 was written way back in 1949, it has really stood the test of time and could quite easily have been written yesterday. The themes running throughout are a somewhat disturbing reflection of our current society in which technology has advanced to the point where, with the push of a button, it's not difficult to keep tabs on members of the public. Often these fictional futuristic societies in literature seem unrealistic or far fetched, but the Orwell classic does an amazing job of describing a time in the future (now the past) which seems almost grounded, believable, and now even 28 years later seems entirely possible. In a time when most computers and TV's have built-in cameras, big corporations can hack phones and intercept messages, the government can pinpoint your current location from a satellite in space and the average member of the public (using the GPS built into their phones) willingly 'checks themselves in' on Facebook two or three times a day... it's not a far stretch to say that we might one day lose our privacy altogether. It's a scary thought and it's really no wonder this book has achieved it's status as a cultural iconic classic.I'd highly recommend it to anyway."
1598,Maria Gonçalves,"I loved 1984 by George Orwell. Is not an easy book to read I have to be honest and you need to be in the mood to read it otherwise, it will be in your bedside for a long time. I loved the story from the beginning but sometimes I wanted something easy for the brain because I was too tired and in those cases, this book is not a good option.I completely lost myself in it. It is marvellously written and the story is fascinating. Orwell knows how to give descriptions without boring the shit out of you. Every detail is relevant and adds meaning to the story. (As you can see I can’t explain it very well but is an amazing book). It does not end well though. On the other hand, it makes so much sense, that you don’t get upset about it, you were half expecting it. It really is a classic, a magnificent one. This is, a must read before you die, no doubt."

1601,Craig a.k.a Meatstack,"If you think you know this book, because of all the cultural references to it, do yourself the favor and read it first hand. It's not what you think it is.The book is broken down into three sections, and I felt myself drawn to these three sections differently. The first section is setting up the characters and the world. I didn't want to stop reading this, for Mr. Orwell has painted a fascinating, if not disturbing world to ""play"" in.The second section is the most happiest of the three. But, just as the characters themselves knew, it couldn't last. I found myself not wanting to continue reading because I didn't want the book to become the third section...Ah, the third section...the most horrifying and grotesque of the three. Here's where Orwell shines in his accounts on how an individual can be broken down, and re-educated. I found myself rushing through this section to see how it turns out in the end. The entire time I thought ""there has to be an out. When is the salvation?"" it never comes...and the world moves on as it always has. An amazing piece of fiction. Chilling and dark, this really should be on everyone's reading list. "
1602,Cosma,"I can sincerely say that this is one of the best books I have ever read. Being a daughter that escaped the communist regime in Romania, as I was born a few years after it fell I can say, from our country's historical point of view that every word that is written in this book could have been a reality in other circumstances. The book is amazing. It portraits a society of slaves, slaves of hatred, of ignorance and lies. Here, the state is devided in 4 ministries: ""The ministry of love"" (in the business of murdering party traitors); ""The ministry of truth"" (covering lies); ""The ministry of peace"" (coverig war, of course, as you may have already deduced) and last but not least ""The ministry of abundance"" which did not make any money for the prosperity of the state, all of them under the loved/feared face of one man ""The big brother"".The last 150 pages of the book keep you on the edge. I could not leave the book from my hands not even to go to the bathroom :P. The action takes place in the horrifying basements of ""The ministry of love"", where, our hero ends up.I will not spoil it anymore though. The hero's name is Winston Smith. An ordinary man who works in the exterior department of ""The ministry of truth"" and for the first few pages of the books appears (I emphasised on appears) to have been the only human in that entire society that realises what kind of world they are living in.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did! "
1603,David Areyzaga,"This will certainly be a depressing reading since it tells you what you already know, but it has the guts to actually put it on paper. I can't speak about the plot, because the novel speaks for itself. I read it only knowing that it was about Big Brother and 2+2=5, expecting something similar to Animal Farm. Once I finished it, it became one of my favorite novels ever. Orwell's prose is brilliant and polished. The result will be a cynical view about society, but hopeful if the reader is able to see the glass half full rather than half empty."
1604,Brent Mckay,"I love this book so much it seems like a found text, or one handed to me in stealth, like Goldstein's book was to Winston. In my fourth (?) reading now, I see small flaws I never noticed in my adolescence: why the hell did he take Julia with him to see O'Brien for the first time? why did he spill his guts so quickly to O'Brien, in that same first meeting? some of the love-y dialogue needs a rewrite. does the Goldstein book section need to be so long, and so redundant? (interestingly, the superb Michael Radford film adaptation improves many of Orwell's dubious decisions). but if Orwell made 10,000 decisions, he nails 9,990 of them. And I noticed some fascinating sub-plots that I didn't fully appreciate on previous readings: namely, the degree to which Winston, while rebelling against the system, was a violent by-product himself. His fantasies of killing Julia, early in the novel, of celebrating the killing and maiming of the enemies of Oceania (including mothers and their small children, in propaganda films), show the degree to which he, among the most sensitive subjects of the state, has also been desensitized and ruined. He is ruined several times over in this book. The wallop of this book, the grit, the imagination, the dream and warning of the collective dehumanization make it unforgettable, arresting, and oddly beautiful."
1605,Daniel Pereira,"Depois de passar quase um mês após a leitura deste livro, senti que devia alterar a classificação para 5 estrelas. Este foi um livro que realmente me marcou. Dei 4 estrelas no início devido a estar um pouco cansado de partes enormes como os manifestos de algo (que não vou mencionar para não ""spoilar"" ninguém) que estavam escritos numa letra minúscula e difícil de ler.Mas agora, ao olhar para trás, vejo que este livro é, realmente, digno de 5 estrelas e um dos meus all-time favorites. Sempre que passo numa livraria penso que o deveria comprar, porque é um livro que vale a pena ter (eu requisitei numa biblioteca quando o li). O mais interessante deste livro é que acontece-me bastantes vezes estar numa situação quotidiana e recordar cenas do livro que me marcaram. Aguardo ansiosamente o lançamento do novo filme baseado na obra e espero vir um dia a reler o livro. "
1606,Cecelia Thai,"This is brilliant. Go read it. I'm going to go as far as to say it's a work of genius. Terrifying, but brilliant.I've read this book twice and it truly is mind blowing and is probably better the second time. Orwell is a fantastic writer, his prose is clean and his atmosphere is incredible. Small qualm: When Winston reads from 'The Book' -- It can give the impression that Orwell wanted to write 1984 just so that he could insert this little (more like unnecessarily long) rant. I see why he wanted to do it, but it probably does get in the way because it's so long and so boring and so unrelenting. Orwell most likely got a little carried away. But it's ok. Just bear with it, take a break when read this part of the book, I don't advise you attempt it in one sitting. You could fall asleep. But everything else is flawless. Orwell teaches you that books, and even novels can be powerful weapons, they can be though provoking, haunting and terrifying.The world is so well conceived and utterly disturbing. His stance on anti-authoritarianism is perfectly transposed into fiction and is honestly one of the best books I have ever read, objectively and subjectively."
1607,Vance Merrill,"WEEKLY PROGRESS: I read 49 pages (up to part two) and i've extended my reading places to passenger seats in cars, and on grass under trees on sunny days (litteraly). GOAL SETTING: Well, i've solved my issue of it being super boring to read by downloading the audiobook. My new goal is to make sure my group stays on top of their reading... though I have no idea how. I'm only worried about one member, and I have shared my audiobook with this member as hope of allowing this member an easier time of staying on top of the reading. That sentence sucked. MEDACOGNATIVE JOURNAL: The reading has definitely become easier over this last week, and because i had a race for crew, this was the only thing i brought with me to do, and it started to get done whenever i had free time. this fact was quite surprising to me seeming as how i NEVER get work done at races, this was the first time i actually did. I'm good at clichés. Anyway, 1984 is really taking too long to get exciting. i'm almost certain that it wont get exciting. Its kind of funny, because i read through the part where Winston tries to pull out past information from an old man in a pub, in determination of finding out whether life was better before or after the revolution of Big Brother, and Winston became very impatient with the old man's incapability of answering his question after shaving down all of the unnecessary details of his question and eventually asking as bluntly as he could, while the old man understood it as whether or not he likes life as an old or young person. Its funny because this is how i feel about the book at this point. There are all these airy details overflowing every page, tons and tons of unnecessary information when you are only able to find one or two things within the mess of water that actually get you somewhere within the book. A lot of the things talked about are like, Winston walking.... OOOOO... A DIFFERENT WAY HOME, and he reminds the reader at every chance that doing anything out of the ordinary will disturb the thought police and you will certainly be given a definite date by which you will die, but before so you will be tortured into confessing the things you've done. Every time Winston does something he reminds you of these things and this was only in the last part of Part One that I read... The same thing happens with everything, and i just want him to get on with the story."
1608,Peter Bjarke Juul,"not a pageturner as such, but a scary portrait of power nonetheless. the world has changed wildly since I first read it in the 80s. the structures of power classes are unchanged, although the ultrarich has taken over from the party people."
1609,Jailan El-Rafie,"A fierce, breathtaking, relentless eye-opener to some of the harshest of truths about human nature, politics, the past, the future, and, largely, the fragility of the man-made system that we live in. This book was published in 1949 and is striking in how futuristic it is and how accurately it depicts lots of ideas and situations that exist today.It is fair to say that very few people on Earth could righteously judge this book, and I am not one of them. This book surpasses the standard of most literary works that I am familiar with. Everything from the ideas to the technicalities of writing was overwhelming."
1610,Aya Ihab,"As a novel I would have rated it as a 1 star, because part one was a bit boring and the plot itself is not that intricate nor interesting.yet I rate it as five after I've recognised it as a description of a miserable dystopia perfectly mingled with a series of professionally written long essays that lay bare the ugly truth behind the DIVINE communism/socialism ideologies.I can't still believe that George Orwell anticipated that dark future, which is unfortunately the reality in some contries now,in 1948!!"
1611,Munif,"جورج أوريل والتوقع لما سيحصل بعد أربعين سنة من تاريخ كتابته لهذه الرواية، لم يخمن أو يطرح الواقع المرير هكذا، بل بما كان عليه العالم وقتها من نهاية الحرب العالمية الثانية وغيرها من الاستبداد الحاصل في تلك الحقبة.بطل الرواية ""وينستون سميت"" رجل كغيره يبحث عن الحرية، ولكن لم تكن تلك الحرية موجودة، بل ""عامة الناس"" لا يعرفون معنى كلمة حرية بسبب القاموس الجديد الذي أنشئه الحزب. العالم مقسم إلى ثلاث دول، أوقيانا التي يعيش فيها وينستون بقيادة ""الأخ الكبير"" وشعار تلك الحزب او الدول هو ""الأخ الكبير يراقبك"". أنت دائما مراقب أينما تذهب، في بيتك وعملك والشوارع وفي كل شيء، يعرفون عنك كل شيء. عندما تحاول أن تثور على الحزب فحكم الاعدام يواجهك بل لن تصل الى الثورة أبداً، عندما فقط تفكر بأسقاط النظام أو ""ليسقط الأخ الكبير"" في هذا الحال تعتبر مجرم فكر وفي هذه الحال لا تعدم فور القبض عليك بل يّخلو عقلك من الأفكار الفاسدة ويجّردوا أنسانيتك ثم إما يعدمونك أو يطلقوا سراحك وهذا الاقتباس يلخص فكرة مجرم الفكر""ان جريمة الفكر لاتفضى الى الموت انها الموت نفسه"". الكلام كبير حول هذه الرواية وكل ما أستطيع توضيحه موجود في هذا الحوار من الرواية:“اوبراين: ""كيف يؤكد إنسان سلطته على إنسان آخر يا وينستون؟""قال وينستون بعد تفكير: ""يجعله يقاسي الألم""رد أوبراين: ""أصبت فيما تقول. بتعريضه للألم، فالطاعة وحدها ليست كافية، وما لم يعانِ الإنسان الألم كيف يمكنك أن تتحقق من انه ينصاع لإرادتك لا لإرادته هو؟إن السلطة هي إذلاله و إنزال الألم به , وهي أيضا تمزيق العقول البشرية إلى أشلاء ثم جمعها ثانية وصياغتها في قوالب جديدة من اختيارنا.هل بدأت تفهم أي نوع من العالم نقوم بخلقه الآن ؟ إنه النقيض التام ليوتوبيا المدينة الفاضلة التي تصورها المصلحون الأقدمون, إنه عالم الخوف و الغدر والتعذيب, عالم يدوس الناس فيه بعضهم بعضا.عالم يزداد قسوة كلما أزداد نقاء , إذ التقدم في عالمنا هو التقدم باتجاه المزيد من الألم.لقد زعمت الحضارات الغابرة أنها قامت على الحب والعدالة أما حضارتنا فهي قائمة على الكراهية, ففي عالمنا لا مكان لعواطف غير الخوف و الغضب والإنتشاء بالنصر وإذلال الذات, واي شيء خلاف ذلك سندمره تدميراً..” "
1612,Chaohua,"Born and raised in socialist China(pre-2000s), I identified with the society depicted by the book more than I wanted to. All the propaganda mechanisms described in the book looked way too familiar that I couldn't help but wonder if party members of Mao's era actually studied the book themselves and implemented what the book had to offer. Although communism frenzy from 1949-1976 has ebbed, certain mindsets still exist today in my father's and my grandfather's generations. I'd be elated if people from the Department of Education would add this book to Chinese high school kids' mandatory reading list. We don't want this part of the history to repeat itself."
1613,Stone Pan,"Normally books/movies about future strike me as mere special imagination with intriguing factors, with overly developed machinery, extremely harmful or helpful technology, brand-new form of living; human body are like chemical experimental lab, enhanced or transformed in every possible way. Kind of exaggerating, eye-catching, ridiculous, unilateral, but fun. 1984 warns readers of a tendency, describes a scary future of deformed society/political system with extreme ways of mind control in order to fortify its regime. It's about totalitarianism and brainwash, about torture and being mind blind. The government amends the history and the language. Forcible infusion of political concept and intake of fake information. Citizens (or proles) are living out of privacy and capacity to reason, leading a life of which everything is lie and falsification, but at the same time feeling proud and at peace about their life. Social hierarchy stays inconceivably strong and stable. The suppressed remains suppressed, the superior remains superior. Peace it is. Each basic need is satisfied. Quite weirdly ideal in a way, but also undoubtedly pointless and infuriating to lead such life when it's put like that; however, the scariest part about 1984 is not even that.. It's the fact that there is no obvious way that such controlling wouldn't work, especially under a circumstance same as the one described in the book. Feels like when given a chance/condition, when there is no resource scarcity, no interdependence among countries, no law, no more pursue of advanced technology, even no human instinct demand (they are working on it), when all that is left for humanity to worry is gone, when stability is the only thing the government or the society is after, when power and regime comes first, when people's heretic mind is the only factor that would endanger such situation, ""1984"" would be a very possible option.PS: The book contains lots of classical and insightful sentences, perspectives and conclusions. So true that even after decades of different happenings, the world still accords with most part of them.. "

1615,Anum ,"Freedom is freedom to say that two plus two makes four. If that is granted, everything else follows.Winston Smith lives in post-World War II era, where there are three super powers in the world, Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, and most of the land of the world belongs to them. Winston belongs to The Party, which rules Oceania but only as a member of the outer body and works in the Ministry of Truth, writing, rewriting and re-rewriting history as demanded by The Party. To be the member of The Party implies three things for him: 1.	Big Brother is always watching you. 2.	You have no power, thought, purpose or will as an individual. 3.	But if you consider yourself to be really a part of The Party so much so that you think you ARE The Party, you own everything in Oceania and you are as good as indestructible. Unfortunately for Winston, he does not consider himself to be really a part of The Party. Instead, he considers himself to be an enemy of The Party. Consequently, he regularly takes part in all sorts of “thought crimes” including remembering the past as it was and not as The Party says it was, falling in love with a woman, Julia, and pursuing the possibility of courting her, planning to join a rebel underground group bent on destroying The Party and believing that indeed The Party can be destroyed. However, there is only one outcome of such crimes in Oceania: a trip to the Ministry of Love. 1984 is by far the worst book I have ever read! Don’t get me wrong, this is still a 5-star review. What makes 1984 the worst book in the history of all my book reading is not that the book is terribly written. Instead, it is the exact opposite. George Orwell writes dystopia as it is meant to be written: haunting, disturbing and downright nightmarish. Reading Part III was especially difficult for me. I could not read more than a few pages at a time, because I was just so disturbed. The torture inflicted in the Ministry of Love does not make you cry out tears for Winston and it does not make you sad or distraught. Actually, you end up feeling nothing for Winston, but horrified at the possibility of such things happening to you. It the mother of all nightmares coming to life, where you are safe nowhere, not even inside your own head, because The Party, for its own safekeeping, will get inside it if need be. The Party will make you love who it wills and hate who it wills, it will make 2 + 2 = 5, even if you know in your head that there is no way that it can be anything other than 4. It will change the past because it owns the past. The Party doesn’t only have the power to change the past in the records, but it even has the power to change it in your memories, because it controls everything- the records and your memory. Oceania is not just the epitome of totalitarianism, but it is a step ahead of it! By mastering doublethink, a process by which you can hold two contradictory things true in your mind, it has not only taken control of the land, the people and the resources but also has taken control of the course of history and the memories and emotions of the inhabitants of Oceania. The Party from time to time changes its allies from Eurasia to Eastasia and then back to Eurasia leaving the third its enemy in war. However, in the records of Oceania and in the minds of the people of Oceania The Party has only ever been at war with one of them. Whenever The Party changes its alliance from one to the other, it simply changes all the records to match the new enemy. Winston remembers that Oceania had been at war with Eurasia only about four years ago and had been in alliance with Eastasia, however, all “sane” party members know, remember and believe that, “No, Oceania is at war with Eastasia. It has always been at war with Eastasia.” If only yesterday, The Party again betrays Eurasia and declares war on Eurasia, all “sane” party members will remember that, “Oceania is at war with Eurasia. It has always been at war with Eurasia.” Only Winston’s “insanity” believes in a reality that is physically separated from the mind of The Party and that needs to “cured.”One of the most intriguing parts of the novel is the three slogans that arise from The Party’s ideology, “Ingsoc.” 1.	WAR IS PEACE: The relevance of this slogan may be felt from the beginning of time to perhaps the end of time for the human race. War has been the only constant throughout history. Conflict has remained ingrained in societies no matter how much they try to curb it. As Plato once said quite wisely, “Only the dead have seen the end of war.” Mr. Orwell takes advantage of his dystopian world and looks deeper into the meaning of constant war. He insinuates that war is necessary to maintain peace. War is essential to ensure that all surplus production of a powerful country is not used to eradicate class structure in the world. War is essential to dump that surplus in the form of destruction and devastation. War is essential for constant power, whether it is for a class of people, a mindset, an organization or even an ideology. WAR IS PEACE. As Orwell says, ""A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war."" Orwell understands that peace within a community can only remain when its people remain completely loyal to the ruling authority. To ensure that, there needs to be an enormous threat on the outside from whom the ruling authority is constantly protecting them through a never-ending war. Only in such a state of affairs will the people be focused too well on the external threat that they will not dream to rise up to become an internal one. 2.	FREEDOM IS SLAVERY: Nothing could explain this slogan better than O’Brien who says that the truth is that “Slavery is freedom. Alone – free – the human being is always defeated.” The individual can never be more than a body travelling towards its death. The individual is “doomed to die,” and O’Brien dubs that as “the greatest of all failures.” Orwell is bringing out the truth in human need for submission, whether it is to a promise beyond the grave, their work before the grave, an ideology, a hobby or even another human being. Alone, a human being is nothing more than a forgettable entity that as good as ceases to exist the moment it drops dead. However, “if he can make complete, utter submission, if he can escape from his identity,” he can become something more. Nevertheless, as everything has a price, this is priced at the individual’s freedom. O’Brien reiterates the meaning of being a party member by saying that “if he (an individual) can merge himself in the Party so that he is the Party, then he is all-powerful and immortal.” The Party believes its ideology to be eternal and everlasting. Any member of that ideology will consequently be eternal. However, they shall also be eternally enslaved. 3.	IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH: The simplest of the three, is perhaps also the most deep rooted of all the slogans of The Party. “The Book”, apparently written by Goldstein, begins with the ever-known fact that “Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle and the Low.” Goldstein gives insight into the true nature of the three classes. He shows us that the High always want to remain where they are, the Middle want to overthrow the High and take their places and the Low, whenever they are not so caught up in trying to survive, being at the very bottom of the Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, wish for equality. However, the Low are also the only ones who are “never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims.” They always end up being used by the Middle attracted to their so called slogans of “freedom, justice and fraternity,” only to be “thrust” back down “into their old position of servitude” after the Middle have achieved their aims. This internal struggle ultimately leads to instability of power within a land and a never-ending cycle of power switching results. In order to counter this The Party realizes that it needs to freeze the classes. The Party does this by learning from the position of the Low. The Low never have enough resources, time, will or energy to think anything through. They are always caught up in the acts of survival. The Party induces a state of ignorance in all the three classes in Oceania by thrusting them to the basest level of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. There is never enough of anything in the market, what is available is terrible to eat and almost always artificial, shelter has been transformed into a place of constant surveillance, sex has been made undesirable and forbidden, family lives have been poisoned with the children betraying their parents and parents afraid of their own little ones and security is a concept unknown to all. In such state of affairs, who would dream of thinking of equality, liberty, justice or anything apart from survival? Only a few. The Party ensures that those few are also taken care of. In order for anyone to rise against their current condition of existence, they usually need something to compare it to. If the comparison is the Past, The Party controls it to no end, with its ideology of doublethink and constant “fixing” of “misquoted” facts. The Past does not exist in Oceania but as a confirmation of the Present. Therefore, there is no comparison in the past. If it is a matter of comparison with another community then The Party ensures that the people of Oceania never lay eyes on any part or any person of either Eurasia or Eastasia. Lastly, if the comparison is in their heads, in their whims and their wishes, then The Party “cures” them in the Ministry of Love before annihilating their very existence! Ignorance is strength, because it ensures that no one knows any better than what is, because what is was always what was and what was is nothing more than what is. Everything in Oceania is diseased but Winston still realized in the midst of all the disease a profound truth. “There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.” But with The Party you were not even safe inside of your own head. To get you to accept their untruth they would go to the lengths of ensuring you were mad. The Party would make you believe that their lies were truth. It would make you unknow what you know and know what you wish to unknow. The Party’s disease plagues everything, not only the goodness of truth but also the sanctity of love. Winston tells Julia that betrayal would not be to confess, because everyone ends up confessing in the end to what they have done and more. He says that real betrayal would be that if The Party could somehow make him stop loving her. However, Julia naively states that they could not do that, “They can make you say anything - anything - but they can’t make you believe it. They can’t get inside you.” If only someone told her that not only could they do that, but they would do that. And so they both betray one another in the Ministry of Love and as that thought bleeds into Winston’s mind at the end of his story, a voice sings in his head,“Under the spreading chestnut treeI sold you and you sold me-“ One might wonder the purpose of such extreme measures and they are simply this, “One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes a revolution in order to establish a dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.” It is true that 1984 is one of the worst things that I have ever read but, in the true spirit of doublethink, that does not prevent it from being one of the best as well. If it were possible I would have given it 6 out of 5 stars! ;) "
1616,Hans Hirschi,"I read this book the first time back in the year 1984, and saw the movie the same year. We laughed, we didn't, just couldn't, believe that any of this could happen in reality.Thirty years later, this book is more relevant than it has ever before. There are more security cameras in a place like London than Orwell could've imagined. The Snowden files have demonstrated just how far beyond 1984 we've actually come.This is really why I keep coming back to this book, over and over again. It's the darkest thing we have in literature, yet not even Orwell could foresee that we'd be even worse off!Have you ever read this book? If you haven't, read it! It's one of those books every human being who can read must read."
1617,Andy Topham,"I absolutely love 1984, the life of Winston Smith in a dictatorial regime is exceptionally scary and to me shows the dangers of the state and control over people’s thoughts, actions, speech and even the history they read. Orwell wrote a book that had far more effect than he could ever imagine and has changed the history of the world as the story explains the dangers of living in a world where you are continually watched and your life is controlled. I love the ideas in the story Big Brother, Room 101, junior spies practicing on their parents to see if you betray Big Brother, Hate Week, the Ministry of Truth, Ministry of Love and the Ministry of Plenty. Overall the chilling thing about the book is that so much in terms of surveillance and control has come true. Political correctness we can even see as Newspeak, using language to control our thoughts. As well as the government reading emails, CCTV cameras and even the power of the media over our thoughts.George Orwell, changed the world for the better when he wrote 1984, as he made us aware of control."

1619,Betzacosta Fiction,"Este libro me hizo sentir tantas cosas que fue maravilloso.Primero, por la posición en donde me encuentro en mi país vi tantas similitudes que la sensación de desolación y miedo me llenó en toda la primera parte del libro.Lo más triste es lo posible de este mundo, o la existencia de este régimen. Desde el principio de los tiempos el poder ha corrompido, y el poder absoluto corrompe absolutamente.La forma de crear un régimen tan perfecto y escalofriante está a un paso de distancia, ya que solo hace falta la oportunidad, la unión y que la gente buena no haga absolutamente nada.Es un libro que desde el principio sabes que no hay esperanza, pero igual quieres sentirla en algún momento, solo que en verdad nunca llega. Wilson es alguien común, alguien que incluso veo a mi alrededor y en mí misma, una persona normal, sin ningún tipo de poder y que puede adecuarse a lo que sea que obtiene, como son los humanos. Quien siente que es rebelde solo por sus pensamientos, pero del pensar al hacer hay tanto que nunca llega a la realidad. Aunque él hizo su propia rebelión, con Julia y con OBrien, el resultado, como el mismo sabía, era el mismo.Julia, es como es la sociedad misma, con poder o sin poder, en general somos ignorantes, en general solamente nos importa nuestro propio placer o lo que únicamente nos afecta, pero de resto no forzamos un sistema, porque sirve en la medida en que nos permite hacer lo que deseamos hacer, así no le permita hacer a los demás absolutamente nada.La visión que el libro presenta sobre el poder, sobre el sistema, sobre el análisis del pasado y de los distintos posiciones políticas tiene mucha profundidad y es como el propio Winston dice ""los mejores libros son los que escribe las cosas que ya uno sabía"".Ciertamente este libro no tendría nada que nosotros no supiéramos, sobre el sistema totalitario, sobre la intensión de los demás intentos de gobiernos totalitarios,sobre el uso de los medios de propaganda para beneficio de una facción, y sobre la idea de que al controlar el presente controlamos el pasado, también tendría que ver al controlar el pasado controlan el presente, ya que si bien ellos lo eliminaron por completo para el ser común, ellos tienen recopilado todo el verdadero pasado, porque como muy bien se sabe, el hombre que no conoce su pasado está destinado a repetirlo.Lo asombroso de todo es la forma en como la verdadera premisa de Orwell es introducirnos un mundo donde el sistema reinante no solo conoce el pasado, sino que posee las armas para que nadie más lo conozca, y que a su vez APRENDIÓ SU PASADO Y PERFECCIONÓ PARA NO COMETER LOS MISMOS ERRORES.Casi me hace agradecer a esta sociedad ignorante, incluyéndome, que vemos como una y otra vez la historia se repite en cada país, con las modificaciones particulares del caso, y no se dan cuenta en realidad de que cometemos una y otra vez los mismos errores.Otro punto maravilloso y agridulce del libro es la falta completa de justificativos. EL poder es lo más importante. Todos sabemos que eso es verdad, todos absolutamente, en el fondo de nuestro corazón, comprendemos que cuando una persona dirige un estado, un movimiento, una revolución, una contrarevolución, el fin de eso es tener el poder. Puede ser escondido con falacias, con fantasias, con sueños de libertad, mejoría social, igualdad. Incluso la misma persona puede creer conscientemente que esos son los únicos motivos que los mueve. Pero en el fondo es el poder lo que los llama.Es refrescante y aterrorizador ver como en Oceania, y sus colindantes se quitaron la careta y aceptaron que efectivamente ese era su objetivo, aclarando que es por ello que principalmente se diferencian de los demás. Ciertamente, la mayoría de los procesos totalitarios que se basan o se justifican con esos fines altruista terminan siendo derrocados porque los mismos sujetos quieren eso, sea uno que otro renagado del mismo partido o la sociedad.Es un mundo gris, es un mundo desesperanzador, pero sobre todo, es un sistema que como el mismo Winston, Julia y OBrien bien dijeron, absoluto e infalible, lo cual es lo más desgarrador. Nada es absoluto, nada es eterno, pero como bien dijo Smith, la prole tiene las llaves para acabarlo, pero dentro de mucho, mucho tiempo.Muy buen libro."
1620,Dawn Anderson,"AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ . Mirrors current political crisis and implies the final destination of consequence . At times utterly disturbing to me , it is the reality of the present picture , torture and all . Dare to look at the truth !"
1621,Arun Divakar," When I opened my eyes, I was tied to a pole. My clothes were in tatters and I could feel a wind as sharp as razor blades grating against my skin. What made me open my eyes was the heat and a glare in front of my closed eyelids. The sands stretched everywhere I could see and the heat wrapped me in its coils like a python. I tested the strength of my bonds but they gave no sign of being even a bit loose. I was so absorbed in that act that I never heard the man approach.Even in the heat, he seemed the least bit unruffled and carried an iron rod in his hands which he kept rolling on his palms. The answer to my plea for help was a knee crushing blow and then it was a long drawn out ballet of pain... This describes to a small extent what Orwell's book made me feel. I have not in recent times been so disturbed or unsettled by a book. The climate in my hometown right now is of suffocating heat. The kind of heat that sits on your chest and beats the living daylights out of you and this combined with the stark portrayal of a totalitarian society in this book was enough to make me a great deal uncomfortable.1984 is a grime coated lens through which we look into an alternate world that horrifyingly reflects our own. A world that is divided into three super powers who perennially play war games with the world as their chess board. The most ugly of the fictional horrors are not the monsters or the psychotic killers but such an oppressive society. A society that destroys and alters beyond imagination history,art,literature,sex, theology and even human memory. It is a void that swallows a mass of humanity and spits out a race of zombies. In a way, the theory that Ursula Le Guin proposed in  The left hand of darkness  is turned about on its head in this book. A society of people whose every sexual urge is repressed and brutally eliminated will spend all that energy hating and growing to be increasingly violent and war-like.Do not let any one lull you into the complacence of believing that this is a political novel or a commentatory. This is a horror novel and is extremely effective at it too. It hammers into your head, the fact that a soul that is broken could perhaps be termed the most ugly facet of mankind. What is more repugnant is the fact that another fellow human being can break the soul with much more finality than the celestial beings who are believed to live upstairs in the heavens. This book will remain relevant for generations to come and in my belief it will only go out of existence if we cease to be a war mongering tribe or if we exorcise the unblinking,unwavering attachment to politics. The character of O'Brien is someone whom I have seen and heard in the guise of many other names through news papers and TV Channels. He is an embodiment of what fanatical political belief can do to a human being. The article titled  The theory and practice of Oligarchichal Collectivism  is a master stroke and I do not think anyone but Orwell could have written such a beautiful piece of political dissection in his own style. I must read this book again but not any time soon lest it reduce me to a gibbering mess ! "
1622,Erwing Ruiz,"Más que una novela, es una advertencia, de la deformación de los ideales revolucionarios de igualdad. Como dice Orwell, al final siempre existen tres clases sociales: los bajos, los medios y los altos. Y cuando se da una revolución, los medios utilizan a los bajos para posicionarse como los altos, y al final, nada cambia, para la prole nada cambia. Esto ocurrió en Oceanía, el país ficticio donde vive Winston Smith, sólo que esta vez encontraron la forma de perennizarse en el poder, mediante el control del pasado, los hechos y la mente humana. Incluso de los sentimientos. Winston Smith es un hombre cualquiera, en el sentido de que no es relevante para la sociedad, un simple operador en el Ministerio de la Verdad. Sin embargo, Winston tiene ideas en contra del Partido. Ideas que, como él sabe, significan su muerte tarde o temprano, porque el Partido no se permite una mente descarrilada, no puede haber una mancha en la mente colectiva. Y precisamente por eso, aunque se condene a muerte a los crimentales, antes se les regresa al redil. Porque la victoria no está en vencer, sino en convencer. El morir hereje significa una victoria en contra del Partido. Y eso no es posible, porque el Partido es inmortal.Una gran reflexión de Orwell, quien se revela como un analista socio-político de gran calibre, un crítico de la condición humana, y un pesimista lamentablemente. "
1623,Swapnil Gore,"unsettling.deeply disturbing and extremely melancholic.Full of agony and despair.Yet it is an masterpiece.The climax is an antithesis to ""and they lived happily ever after"".Big brother ensures that even the devout are compelled to sacrilege to save themselves,and this is what rips your soul.I was in a daze after reading the book. I never felt you could ever feel that way after reading a book.Its more than a year,but I still remember the intensity of the emotions it elicited.It is a must read for anyone for the sheer reason that it just extends the realm of emotions you would have ever experienced while reading a book.If ever I wanted to know to the depths to which humanity can stoop I will start reading it again."

1629,Nandini Goel,"1984 by George Orwell is a fine satirical work where Orwell speaks about how in future everything would be governed by hate and tyranny. He speaks about future where people will be callous and the only feeling permitted / sustain would be love for the Big Brother(or the tyrant). Children would be devoid of love from their parents from the time of their birth. Although, the year 1984 didn't turn out to be what Orwell described but slowly some of the events he had described seems to coming true into our society. The thing I could relate the best was ""Newspeak"", which Orwell describes as the only language whose dictionary gets smaller each year. This kind of influence can very well be seen in the present day world, where people instead of saying ""Happy Birthday"" are writing HBD or other kind of abbreviations. Introduction of such abbreviations in our society is narrowing our thought process and our vision. We don't have telescreens today but surely our world is governed by cameras. Everywhere we have CCTV Cameras and personal privacy has reduced to minimum (Although, today we are using cameras for security purposes.) In the near future, our computers will keep a watchful eye on us 24x7 and as for the microphones we will have our mobile phones.Now, to protect our world from becoming a world as described by George Orwell some prophylactic measure need to be taken and the most important of all is to eliminate all sorts of rancor and discords from our society.It is time that we promulgate peace for as long as abhorrence prevails our world shall only deteriorate.Best RegardsNandini Goel"
1630,Joanna b,"1984 / big brother has become a catch all term for cctv surveillance, but its really about so much more than that. The lies they tell Winston Smith and the lies that he tells his readers are the still same lies told to us everyday. Long live Anon."
1631,عبد الإله,A novel with which I had much suffering. Hope is the first to perish at the final page of it. 
1632,Oliver,"The novel 1984 by George Orwell is the story of Winston Smith, a member of the revision section of the Ministry of Truth. It is Winston’s job to rewrite the truth, in order to keep up the government's good reputation. Although his whole life is devoted to the government, Winston has a deep hatred for Big Brother, the icon that watches over civilization and invades the people's privacy. When Winston and his co-worker Julia are recruited by and join the Brotherhood, a secret anti-big brother agency, they find themselves in a lot of trouble. O’Brien from the thought police is on their trail! Although quite different from a traditional science fiction book, it fits into this category because of Orwell’s portrayal of a futuristic society where government controls everything and individuals have no independence. The story takes place in Oceania, one of three superstates. In Oceania, people live in high-rise apartments in the central district or in surrounding suburbs where the government’s monitoring efforts are lower. The themes of this book are serious and Orwell’s writing style is complex, making it a very difficult read. Despite this, it is fascinating to think about what life would be like without freedom or privacy. It is well written and detailed. For these reasons, I loved the book. I'm warning you: do not be surprised when your brain explodes! If you are under 14, I would recommend waiting to read this book so that you can completely understand and fully appreciate the meaning of the book. If you're over 14, however, and looking for something totally different and original, this is the book for you! I rate it 5 stars!"

1637,Rajani,"This is not the type of books that I would have read 5 years ago. Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of it's seemingly simple yet bone-chilling story line. This is a story which shows how in a dystopian future, everything which is taken so much for granted is challenged and people who dare to follow it are out rightly persecuted.The story flows perfectly to give you hope for a bright beautiful future and snatch it away just as cruelly. "
1638,Roshio,"This has been on my to-read list for as long as I can remember (as with most classics really), what a pleasure it was. I can't say I was immediately sucked in, but once I did step into the story properly I was blown away. The world Orwell describes is terrifying and yet so believable when you really look around us today. You only have to look at David Cameron's current attempts to monitor all online activity to realise this. And I think for me its the mixture of science fiction and potential realism that really made this an absolutely brilliant book especially given the time it was written. I just love Orwell. "

1642,Aja,This is one of the most terrifying books I've ever read. Not for any reason other than we are moving closer to this reality every single day. How Orwell had this foresight boggles me. But certain ideas in this book will give me nightmares for years to come. 
1643,TheLeninist,"Its probably unnecessary to explain the plot for this one but here it goes. Winston Smith is a man living in a future totalitarian society in a country called Oceania. Oceania is constantly at war with its two enemies East-Asia and Eurasia which are also at war with each other. These 3 countries include the entirety of earth and they are all equal in strength so that the war will never end. None will ever make a winning blow. The people in Oceania are constantly being monitored by hidden microphones and telescreens. Its forbidden to defy the party(INGSOC) or even think about defying the party, hence the term ""thought crime"". Winston works at the Ministry of truth which controls the media and also makes constant changes to history. The book goes to great detail in explaining this strange world. How the people think and act, talk and what about. They have a new developing language called Newspeak which is supposed to be as efficient as possible and also lacks all the words that could harm the party. Its fascinating. The book is also a famous critique of totalitarianism and socialism but I think its more anti USSR then anti Socialism. Oceania is a gross bastardization of Communism and as such the book is more of a criticism of such bastardizations, like what the USSR became rather than Communism itself. At least thats how I see it. If it is indeed just a critique of Communism its just a huge ad-hom. Totally excellent book in many respects. The drama is great, the story is great and its an amazing Sci-fi with a good message. 5/5*"
1644,Daniel Bastian,"1984 is probably the best-written book I've pulled from the shelf to date. That there's an absorbing and urgent narrative here as well is icing on the Orwellian cake. The lessons of Oceania transcend era and have lasting value for those working to organize and uplift society. It's as if Orwell has reached into the future and touched the mood of the present. One can connect with ease Orwell’s cautionary dystopia to the depredations of American privacy that have surfaced in just the last few years. Much of 1984’s quirky “Newspeak”—terms like thoughtcrime, doublethink and Big Brother—have been absorbed into the modern idiom. Among the rarefied collective of the greatest writers the English language has ever known, George Orwell painstakingly crafted a penetrating, prophetic tale, a world within a world, a spiraling ideascape whose tendrils integrate seamlessly with the realities of modern life.Here's a small sampling of the winged brilliance flanking the reader at every turn:“He was a fattish but active man of paralyzing stupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms – one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than on the Thought Police, the stability of the Party depended.” (p. 22)""She had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it."" (p. 66)""Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious."" (p. 70)""But there was still that memory moving round the edges of his consciousness, something strongly felt but not reducible to definite shape, like an object seen out of the corner of one's eye."" (p. 122)""To hang on from day to day and from week to week, spinning out a present that had no future, seemed an unconquerable instinct, just as one's lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available."" (p. 152)""What opinions the masses hold, or do not hold, is looked on as a matter of indifference. They can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect.""

1645,Alexandra,"I had previously marked this book as ""read"" but I don't think I ever really read 1984. I believe I was confusing it with a Brave New World by Aldous Huxley- both great dystopian books, but nevertheless different within themselves. Anyways, I am so glad I can say that I have officially read 1984. This was largely perpetuated by the book club that was formed at my workplace! The beginning of 1984 can seem a bit slow to get into but trust me, it definitely picks up! Chapter 9 was pretty rough in terms of the jargon and density of what Winston, the main protagonist, was reading, but if you take your time and really decipher everything the concepts that are repeatedly brought up will come together. This book was handsdown written before its time. George Orwell (ahem Eric Blair) was revolutionary in his thinking. The words he brought to life, not only through 1984, but his other books, are extraordinary. MIND OFFICIALLY BLOWN. If you've been meaning to jump into a good old classic or are in the mood for some ORIGINAL dystopian storytelling then look no further- this is the book to turn to. "
1646,Nik," The world is divided into three- Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia who are engaged in a never ending battle. In this war driven existence, Oceania is ruled by Big Brother by ideals drawn through heavy influence of the Nazi and Russian totalitarian regimes and have succeeded in pulling out all stops that had stopped the a fore mentioned to gain complete control over the lives of the citizens. Thus, the Oceania citizens, or rather comrades as they are to call each other now, live a life under constant scrutiny of the party. Their life, their mind is theirs no more. The man lives alone, he has no relations, preferably no emotions other than national fervor and no interactions other than ones that are absolutely required. In this forlorn kingdom, 1984 is the story of a revolution built not through group revolting, flag waving or slogan chanting but a mere thought in the mind of a hopeful soul.  I've recently been scouring my mother's classic collection. And as is the ritual before starting every book, I logged onto goodreads and checked the reviews! And  Voila!  the journey begins...BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU reads out the page in bold capital letters and my mind slowly draws the connection of the book to the popular reality show and a quick google search proves me right. As I commence reading, the book has a mysterious, ancient and intriguing feel to it. ( probably due to the dusty condition of my copy). I gear myself up but fail to quite prepare for what awaits me."" Freedom is the right to say two plus two makes four. If that is granted all else follows. ""I could feel the chills and shivers running through my body as I read every line. Winston appealed to me. He was me. And his world was the world I feared. A world where nothing is private, nothing is unique. He spoke to the part of me that had nightmares of living as a drone. Basically a part which resides in all of us somewhere. (view spoiler)[ The whole concept, Winston's diary, his job which loosely involves rewriting history, the paralles drawn about the functioning of the human mind, his diary, Julia and Winston's relationship, the proles, the purpose of Newspeak, Thoughtcrime and the chilling relevance even decades after it was published  (hide spoiler)]So pick up the book NOW!! If you're still not convinced, here's a little something to get you over the edge,  ""For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable – what then?”“But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.” “Of pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop. Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain. In the face of pain there are no heroes.” ""Confession is not betrayal. What you say or do doesn't matter; only feelings matter. If they could make me stop loving you-that would be the real betrayal.” ― George Orwell, 1984 "
1647,Ryan Tauber,"Quite possibly my favorite novel ever! A brilliant work of science fiction with a political/philosophical message. In high school, I was too young to really appreciate this novel. Having read it again as an adult, I have to say that this is truly one of the best novels ever written!"
1648,Hannah,"1984 is a fascinating distopian novel about a world where every aspect of life is completely controlled by the government, or ""Big Brother."" (The date 1984 would have implied a futuristic novel when the book was written). The main character, Winston Smith, attempts to rebel against the constraints of Big Brother--starting out with the very small step of daring to own a personal diary. Interesting themes of the book involve language and history--what happens when people's ability to express themselves is taken away? (In the novel, the characters speak ""Newspeak,"" and the words for specific emotions and concepts like ""liberty"" are removed from the language). And what happens when media is so manipulated by the government that there is no way to know what is true and what isn't, and no way for the individual to feel him or herself part of a larger world community? 1984 is a gripping read and provides social and political commentary that is just as valuable in our time as when George Orwell first wrote it."

1651,Mo Riah,"As of right now, this book is my absolute favorite. The themes just get you thinking, and I love the style that it's written in. It's a great page turner and has many really interesting ideas. I loved it"
1652,Kim,Still relevant. Scarily so.
1653,Adam19,"I am happy that I waited to read this book until I had ready the Everyman's book of Orwell essays. It contextualized some of the concepts that were present in 1984. I am also happy that I didn't read this book in high school. I think that I appreciate it more than I would if I was younger and didn't understand some of the complexities that exist. It is probably easy to equivocate socialism to totalitarianism or communism to Stalinism if one doesn't have some sort of historical, philosophical, or political context.As far as the narrative goes, I found the writing itself and the philosophical themes much stronger than the plot of characterization. The plot isn't what drives the story as much as the description of the world and the philosophical underpinnings of the society. The one thing that I did find myself trying to predict was who would betray Winston in the end. It seemed like a forgone conclusion that Winston would be captured, it was a matter of who would capture him. With the length of the book, more space was devoted to the exposition of the world that the characters existed in rather than their pasts. I would have liked to have known more about O'Brien's past and what led him to become what he was.The philosophical and political elements follow what had happened in Orwell's life to an extreme. Such a society does not exist on the scale of Oceania in contemporary times. That isn't to say that the themes explored in the book do not stand the test of time. I feel like the technological aspects in particular were prescient. Imagine a television or computer instead of a telescreen. Imagine drones instead of microphones hidden in fields. We have even improved upon the technology of surveillance (I remember Winston mentioning that one could be unobserved in the dark).All in all, this book was a thought-provoking and enjoyable read. I would recommend it to anyone and would encourage prospective readers to read some of Orwell's nonfiction before starting the book."

1656,Leanza,"I read this to complete the challenge ""read a book that scares you,"" and by golly was it fitting. I was worried that I might be underwhelmed because I had such high expectations for this, but no, George Orwell kept shocking and impressing me page after page.There are many frightening themes and concepts in this book: Big Brother, telescreens, newspeak, thoughtcrime and the Thought Police... but the one that boggles my mind the most is doublethink, which is pure mindf***; thinking about it literally hurt my brain at one point. It makes me question the validity of evidence, of facts, of my own memory. It makes me question what is the past and what is reality. For ""if both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself controllable - what then?"" What then??? My goodness. I truly think I'll go crazy if I actually try to perform doublethink.This book will definitely stick with me; there's so much to think about it. I have never been interested in political things at all, but reading George Orwell is really starting to change that. I don't think there's much more I can say about 1984 that hasn't been said already, but I do want to repeat this: it is truly a terrifying and haunting book.---In comparison to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World: (which I ended up spending more time with than the actual review hahaha)Probably the biggest and most obvious difference between the two books is that the government in 1984 uses threats, lies and torture to control people, while the one in Brave New World uses happiness and pleasure; 1984 is hell whereas Brave New World is heaven; 1984 is a dystopia while Brave New World is a utopia - but both of them ultimately end with the loss of humanity and freedom; and it's scary how convincing they both are about how they're ""right"".Personally, I found Brave New World to be more unsettling (which is a plus for me) because it's told in a rather casual tone that implies that everything happening in the book is perfectly normal. Whereas in 1984, we have a main character, Winston, who from the beginning sees, or at least detects, the horror of the society that he lives in. We immediately have someone to empathize with in 1984, but not in Brave New World. Of course there's Bernard and the Savage, but they come in later, and are ultimately shunned. In addition, we see other people's perspectives in BNW that contrast their views (it would have been interesting if we had something similar in 1984). I thought it was very effective for Huxley's part. But that is not to say that the world of 1984 isn't unsettling, because it is.In terms of which is more relevant, I honestly think that today's world is a lot closer to Huxley's prophecy than Orwell's. And if ever (though hopefully not) we do end up like one of those worlds, I believe mankind would be more willing to embrace the society of Brave New World as opposed to 1984, simply because humans prefer pleasure than... well, pain. And as Winston said: ""It is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty ... It would have no vitality.""Reading the last two paragraphs, it would seem as if I prefer Brave New World over 1984, but that isn't completely true. I do think that 1984 is more haunting, more complex, and more thought-provoking; and I think a lot of that has to do with the incredible writing. I love how brutal and straightforward Orwell is and I could not stop quoting his brilliance throughout the entire novel. A frightening, nightmarish plot, combined with great writing, makes for a truly unforgettable and impactful novel. I can definitely understand why many people consider this to be the one of the most influential books of all time.Overall, I think that Huxley's prophecy is more fascinating and, disturbingly, believable, while Orwell's vision is more terrifying and mind-boggling. Ultimately, though, they are both amazing books."
1657,Ala'a  Muhammad ,"People wrote some really good reviews here. So, I'll be content with writing my feels. The strange thing about this book is that it reminds me of somewhere familiar, some people whom I know, part of them control people's behavior in the name of the religion, claiming that they're doing the best for them. And the some other people like what Winston's said are okay with it! A second or a third reading for this book is a must. I loved the whole book but I can't quote it all lol So, one of my favorite parts is how this,""I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wish to. I do not wish to, because the Party does not wish it. You must get rid of those nineteenthcentury ideas about the laws of Nature. We make the laws of Nature.’’But you do not! You are not even masters of this planet. What aboutEurasia and Eastasia? You have not conquered them yet.’’Unimportant. We shall conquer them when it suits us. And if we did not, what difference would it make? We can shut them out of existence. Oceania is the world.’’But the world itself is only a speck of dust. And man is tiny helpless! Howlong has he been in existence? For millions of years the earth was uninhabited.’’Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. How could it be older?Nothing exists except through human consciousness.’’But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals — mammoths andmastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was ever heard of.’Transformed into this,""The law of gravity was nonsense. ’If I wished,’ O’Brien had said, ’I could float off this floor like a soap bubble.’ Winston worked it out. ’If he thinks he floats off the floor, and if I simultaneously think I see him do it, then the thing happens.’""P.s. I don't believe that BB symbolizes God."
1658,Lucinda,"The curious ambiguity of Orwell’s disturbingly distorted mindset, surreptitiously lingers underneath a darkly magnetic nuance.“If no one cares for you at all, do you really exist?”The visual elements which exude redolent representation, juxtapose profoundly the key contrapuntal themes of idealistic Utopias and dramatic dystopias. Orwell’s visionary work of illuminative conceptual truism, is a forceful enunciation of both personal and historically societal realities of the times. As a literary satire of political propaganda, it certainly professes a markedly discernible stylistic expressiveness and clarity. The ‘logic’ within the narrative cleverly breaks through the banality of a reader’s humanistic expectations for free-thinking. [I.e. when the conclusion shockingly flips, thus revealing the veracity of ‘Dystopia’ as a genre]. When we consider Thomas More, Utopia (1516) or the similarly naive idealistic ideas of visionary Utopias, such as; Garden of Eden, Tolkien’s Grey Havens, Atlantis, Heaven etc. it’s as though a dangerously subjective preconception emerges of stretched possibilities. The themes of nationalism, futurology, censorship, surveillance etc. all encompass our future world that’s manufactured on the principles of ‘perfection’. The tug-of-war between our innate human spirit, (freedom) versus oppression (‘caged’ restrictions), similarly to text 
Yellow Wallpaper, Charlotte P Stetson
 is omnipresent. 
Contemporary Dystopian fiction (i.e. The Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins) or films such as The Matrix, The Adjustment Bureau etc. whilst quintessentially show how advancements in technology and consumerism growth lead to tyrannical revolution, they fail to remain faithful to the acute harshness of dystopia’s bittersweet upshot [or intent]. It is as though Orwell’s literary masterwork is a justification to no one; as it doesn’t intend to pleasure the reader by yielding to hopeful, illusive (or fantastical) notions! This less generic, singular work wherein the reader subconsciously falls prey to the credulous entrapment, conveys so much depth of morality. 
It is our sympathetic empathy and our compassion that’s ultimately our own weakness! A synergism founded on love, hope and relation with another [sexual] that generates free-thinking, to expand limitations of thought, questioning and ultimately liberalism (uprising, or revolutionary reform). Just look at the Young Adult novel Divergent for instance, or leaders such as Adolf Hitler, political figures and Suffragettes – everything is interlinked as we defy linguistic suppression : narrowing thoughts/ individualism.  “Sow Utopian seeds to reap realities!”  -- my own personal Quote!! I simply love the Quote, ‘Vagueness and useless shades of meaning…’ for it is so reminiscent and indicative of how when FEAR can CONTROL, or denote all meaning within life itself. For when the narrative alters, skews and warps a perspective through deep focalisation the reader is acutely targeted as bait. Metaphorical embodiment of a certain character (i.e the main protagonist), subconsciously gives rise to empathetic awareness of the tone of a work. 
Henceforward, with the additional use of ‘cognitive salience’ Orwell discernibly draws his reader in, tugging at the strings of human sentimentalities and contiguously mocking our inhibitions! He is uncannily clever to cause disharmonious impaction through the use of autobiographical tones, as he (similarly to other writers) places himself/ his experiences and convictions in the work. Never before have I encountered a literary wonder of such scope, depth and impacting implication of profundity as to shake me to the core! For it questions controversial authoritarianism, unveils the intrinsic link between seeming and being by defying integral norms with adroitness.*Research ‘The Saphir-Whorf hypothesis’ a mould theory of language and linguistic relativity* Everything denotes parallelism with Marxist theorems, such as for instance J Berger’s ways of seeing and the power of language, visual representation and linguistics.  ‘War is peace. Freedom is slavery.Ignorance is strength. "
1659,Jonathan Sarrow,"""Who controls the present, controls the past. Who controls the past controls the future."" This is the fundamental assertion put forth in 1984, that the past is only a combination of our memories and what we are told it is. The challenge for the Party of course is the fact that it is much more difficult to erase memories than it is to build the past with new generations that can't remember it. As such 1984 is primarily a documentation of the struggle between the Winston and the Party for control of Winston's mind and his memories. Winston sees this as an epic battle and ultimately loses it in the end; It is left for us to decide whether the Party can ever be defeated. There are tantalizing clues - is O'Brien really part of the Brotherhood and is there hope in just managing to stay in opposition until the Party gets you? The answer on its surface seems to be no, but it's clear that Winston has been permitted to remain in mental defiance of the Party for seven years and that O'Brien has overseen those seven years before he orchestrates Winston's arrest and conversion. None of this is actually answered and instead the reader has to content him/herself with an understanding of the mechanics of how the Party exerts control (primarily through a combination of manipulation of the past and an undercurrent of raw, overwhelming terror that is impossible to avoid) and compare it to the world we live in today. For me the book continues to show relevance as the trend of 1) facts in public discourse becoming less apparent and 2) the ambiguity surrounding what the government can do in a time of ""perpetual war"" to individuals and citizens (renditions, lack of public trials against enemies of the state, etc.) each bear an uncomfortable resemblance to the Party."
1660,Ioana Silvia,"At this moment, I think ""1984"" is the book that made the biggest impression on me. At some points I almost felt brainwashed. It is at the same time an homage brought to all the humans ever persecuted and tortured and it can truly make you feel what they felt and think what they thought. It is a book that, in my opinion, every person should read. Tip: You need a little patience till you reach the second half, since it is a ""hard to digest"" book. The atmosphere is grey and dull, and the beginning is not very exciting. I didn't read the book all at once. "

1662,Admir,"Considering I am a great fan of dystopian literature, 1984 is one of my favourite books of all time!It tells the story of Winston Smith and his life in a totalitarian country called Oceania (Smith lives in what we would today call London). We follow him in a horrifing story of how a mans life and freedom doesn't mean anything (the word free doesn't even have it's original meaning anymore), and the love for the Party and it's front figure Big Brother is all that matters.A must read for everyone, considering that many of the things described in the book have actually really happened and are happening today, but we are often to blind to see it..."
1663,Tomás Pinho,"The full and exhaustive description of a perfect despotic government led by a party only controlled by a few, but whose face is a semi-unknown figure makes this book a must read for political science students. As an engineer, the amount of machines described in this book used to maintain the position occupied by the party in question shows the work conducted by the author to make this alternate reality as believable as possible."

Da svegli o mentre si dormiva, mentre si mangiava o beveva, dentro casa o fuori, nel bagno, a letto... non c'era modo di sfuggirle. Nulla si possedeva di proprio se non pochi centimetri cubi dentro il cranio.La Storia era un palinsesto grattato fino a non recare nessuna traccia della scrittura antica e quindi riscritto di nuovo tante volte quante si sarebbe reso necessario.Avevo pensato di scrivere il mio commento in Neolingua, ma purtroppo mi vengono in mente troppi aggettivi, troppe sfumature di significato che mi fanno capire che ancora riesco ad esprimermi solo in Archelingua (Italiana, per giunta, neanche Inglese)… L'undicesima edizione del Dizionario non sono riuscita a trovarla da nessuna parte, per fortuna..."
1665,Giuseppe,"LA GUERRA è PACE...LA LIBERTA è SCHIAVITU...L'IGNORANZA è FORZA.lasciando stare la trama, che, anche se non scontata e banale, è un pò prevedibile, è tutto il resto che mi lascia perplesso.è impressionante pensare che questo libro è stato scritto nel 1948.la sua attualita lascia a bocca aperta.sono sconcertanti le descrizioni della manipolazione del Passato per consentire al Partito il controllo sul Presente e quindi sul Futuro.leggendolo non riesco a non fare paragoni con la nostra classe dirigente e i nostri media (giusto per guardare a livello locale e non mondiale).Il Partito riempie la testa della gente con le cose piu assurde, indirizzando l'odio della gente sul bersaglio che fa piu comodo in quel momento al fine, comunque, di mantenere lo stato sociale gia esistente.senza parlare poi del concetto di Bipensiero.e cosa è il Bipensiero?citando: ""il Bipensiero implica la capacità di accogliere simultaneamente nella propria mente due opinioni tra loro contrastanti accettandole entrambe.""""raccontare deliberatamente menzogne e nello stesso tempo crederci davvero, dimenticare ogni atto che nel frattempo sia divenuto sconveniente e poi, una volta che ciò si renda di nuovo necessario, richiamarlo in vita dall'oblio per tutto il tempo che serva, negare l'esistenza di una realtà oggettiva e al tempo stesso prendere atto di quella stessa realtà che si nega, tutto cio è assolutamente indispensabile.""voi non dite che oggi sta succedendo tutto questo?io si."
1666,Christopher Pufall,"As this book has been around for decades, I'll not redundantly review its content, as others have already contributed quite well to that goal, not to mention that the book's notions have been seared into the collective consciousness of society. What I will say is that this is one of the best books I have read from the standoint of the writing itself - sentence, paragraph, and word construction. I think I salivated on my copy every other page, just reading and appreciating the ingenuity of Orwell's Newspeak that saturated the novel.For anyone who is a lover of words, in and of themselves, if you haven't read this, then you probably should. I also found the 1984 film version with Richard Burton and John Hurt to be a particularly effective and uncanny rendition of the material. "
1667,Harrison Farrugia,"As I come near the end of this famous novel, I can easily say that it is one of the best books I have read in recent months or even years. 1984 depicts a world in which a socialist government has erased all memories of the capitalist past and controls the everyday lives of citizens through constant surveillance. The law is enforced by the Thought Police, who will secretly vaporize anyone who they believe to be against Big Brother, the worshiped leader of Oceania (the story's setting, which is actually Great Britain). The plot focuses on the character Winston Smith, who has a constant feeling that the world he lives in is not the perfect world it is made out to be. He knows that there must have been something in the past that was better than it. George Orwell, who wrote during a time of fear of communism and countries that supported it such as the Soviet Union, writes a story that truly makes the reader wonder if even in a society such as ours all that is said to be true really is true. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good story, especially those who are interested in history or politics. "
1668,Perry Vayo,"Wow. I decided to revisit this old classic. Given the current state of things, I thought it would be interesting.I guess the best thing to say is; to condemn this book is to praise it! The book got me depressed and creeped out. The book gave me bad dreams. The book seemed all too familiar. But, this is all high praise for 1984, since what it means is that the predictive nature of the story has borne itself out far too accurately. Perhaps the timeline is off by a few years, but the ever more obvious presence of ""Big Brother"" in our lives is unmistakeable. Read the book...and be very afraid.After reading the book I watches an old BBC interview with George Orwell, and the interviewers last question was, what can we do to prevent this world of yours from taking over our lives? His response was simple: ""Don't let it happen."" Great book! "
1669,Lidiya,"This is by far the most disturbing book I've read. It really makes me think about our individual intellect and the potential it can contribute to society as well as what happens if our ability to think for ourselves are taken away from us. All the while reading ""1984"", I feel like I'm reading an essay more than a novel. There is a sense that Orwell is pushing a particular message to the reader through every portrayal of a scene or the protagonist's thoughts. I remember feeling like I didn't know what to expect from this book at all when I started reading the first few chapters. I felt like a traveler lost and Orwell my only guide so I didn't spend any time on predicting how it would all end. It's funny because after the climax there is more of a hint of how everything will end. There are moments that sucks me in so deeply inside the characters that I know only what they know and can see just as far as they can regarding their own end. This book is a struggle. It is a story about the characters' struggles. Orwell, when he wants to, makes you feel like you're going through these characters' struggle with them. Or at the very least, makes you worry if you're living in a world that is trying to constantly kill your individualism. Needless to say, I find that after putting this book down, I have a new perspective on the way I look at the world...and maybe how it looks back at me. "

1671,Khalil James,"I am not sure if a more brutal form of totalitarianism can be imagined, or has been imagined since. Orwell even took into account the effects of linguistic elements on the nature of thought, much less the nature of thought itself. It is evident that the general thought of most people after taking in this book is that its concept is still extremely relevant today, and should provide a valuable lesson against the encroachment on liberty by capitalism, media, intelligence agencies, the state, and the like. I couldn't agree more. However, I take a a more cynical approach by claiming that a greater attribution of the genius behind 1984 might go to the battle of super powers that was happening at the time this book was written. The Soviet Union's global presence must have made some impression on Orwell, as it did to most of (what we call) the West. Poor George, what a horrible world to conceive. There is reason to be optimistic, however; shown by the great effort that must be made to break a human being down into believing that 2 + 2 = 5. I value this book as highly as any other, and I am certainly happy that I finally decided to read such an influential piece of work."
1672,Daisy Mejia," In George Orwell's ""1984 "" , it is filled and led up the suggestion that power is key to a strong society. In this case specifically, it is referring a dystopian society. The story is based off of a middle-aged man named Winston. Winston lives by himself, is apart of the outer party, and has found himself to be a thought-criminal. He over time, thinks and is always found with the thought of a different world. A world without the system of the party. This which leads to different discoveries and experiences all with a slight twist.  This text overall, is a mere interpretation of a dystopian society. A society that harms its people and continues to do so without stopping. In this case, it reveals what power does to a government, and people in general. It becomes addictive, once used, it is wanted and craved more and more. As said before, it is really a true interpretation of the negative effects obtained from an overload of power that may be set forth or achieved in a society. How it reveals this message is many times in the story the words "" WAR IS PEACE, SLAVERY IS FREEDOM, INSOLENCE IS STRENGTH,"". The Party lives by these words and does not stray from them. Another example from the text is "" You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves."" Revealing what the Party does to people to enforce and maintain its power. This book has been a mind-changing experience, and I recommend it to anyone willing to open their eyes to new possibilities and ideas involving a different world. "
1673,Noor Sabah,"It must be not invented word yet which can fairly describes such literary work . Writing a review about Orwell is totally a daunting task . I will just say ""Your big brother is watching you"" is something or maybe somebody tracking me nowadays ."
1674,Jonny,"This book ""1984"" was a book written by George Orwell and is about his prediction about the future. His vision of the future is a very chilling thought, because he feels that the whole world is going to turn into a communist place. He meets this girl at work named Juila. Winston becomes curious about Juila and thinks that she is the thought police, but finds out that she is not when she slips him a note with the words "" I love you."" They then begin a love affair. When they fall deeper in love his thoughts are changing about their government. Winston makes contact with O'Brien who he thought is not a member oft he thought police but actually is. He arrenges for Winston to get a copy of the book, unfortunately Winstin was captured by the thought police and was eventually tortured. O'Brien is the one that is in charge of how much and when Winston gets tortured. After all that ya s happened to the couple Winston is sent to room 101, where they give him the ultimate torture, Rats. Rats were the worst torture because they basically ate your body while your alive. Winston gives up and says do it to Julia, which was exactly what O'Brien was looking for. It showed that he wasn't in love with her as much as he thought because if he was he would have take the punishment instead of making them do it to his girlfriend. It think that the eight and freshman's should be the level of this book. I believe that because people are starting to think more and more about their future as they are going into high school. "
1675,Amina ,No words for this amazing book by George Orwell. The amount of times that chills ran down my back whilst reading it is amazing. The things he predicted in 1949 is scary - so many things have come true and we don't even realise it. A definite suggestion if you're into all the dystopian future type stuff. Especially if you want to be freaked out as you realise how... we've been intellectually reduced to slaves by the authorities without even knowing it.2+2=5http://aminaahmedsblog.wordpress.com/...
1676,Jason Koivu,"Pre-Review review:While everyone under the sun seems to have read this when they were in high school, I just finally got around to it now. Sure, I've started it before and didn't finish, and I've seen the movie, but come on...I'm almost 40! I think part of me was reluctant, (view spoiler)[knowing that it didn't end well  (hide spoiler)] and knowing the basic gist of it besides.A proper review is coming...RATING: 4.5 (Slight deduction from the full 5 stars for tediousness in the midsection when Orwell stayed on his soap for too long a stretch.)Review IntroductionSince just about everyone has already read this or seen the movie or at least has heard of it enough to know the general story, I feel there's little point in giving my two cents on the book itself. What else could be said? Therefore I'll give you an encapsulation of the feelings I took away from it. Review""Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean they're not after you.""The world is 1984 all over again. It has always been and may always be. We humans can and could do anything we want, ANYTHING, so what do we do? We enslave one another. If there's one universal truth among all homo sapiens, it's that we all want happiness. Instead of working towards that goal, we beat it out of one another. I will no doubt go to my grave having lived under this irrational, tyrannical self-rule, still wondering why. Through the fruits of my own labor and personal struggle, I hope I'm able to squeeze enough sweetness from my time here to lie down the final time with a smile on my face. "
1677,Emily Cullen,"Every so often I'm reading books from the Rory Gilmore Reading Challenge and 1984 was one of them. I read this book in high school and, no real surprise, I ""got it"" better than I did back then. We're way past 1984 and some of the things that George Orwell predicted in 1949 have come true and some have not. Reading this the second time around I would say it's a ""can't put down type of novel"" and is definitely worth a reread or worth picking up for a first time."
1678,Mostafa Alkady,"""إنتبه، الأخ الكبير يراقبك"".إنهم يتتبعونك أينما كُنت، يعرفون ما يجول بخاطرك، لاتستطيع أن تحيد عن الطريق المرسوم لك، إنهم آلهتك الذين لا تستطيع حتى أن تكفُر بهم، ولا إمهال أو صبر لهم على ما تقترفه من جرائم فكرية حائدة عن نظامهم، لا مانع لك منهم إلا الموت ولا شئ غيره، ما يراه الحزب فهو الحقيقة وما تراه أنت هو الوهم والجهل، إنهم ولاة أمورك وهم عين الحقيقة ذاتها التي لا تخطأ ولا تذل، لا خيار لك سوى الطاعة وإلا أسلمت نفسك إلى الجحيم الأرضي، فإن من يمتلك السُلطة هو الإله.سينعدم كل ولاء ليس للحزب، 2+2=5 وقد تكون 3 أو 6 بحسب ما يتوافق مع رؤية الحزب، وليس لك أن تُجادل في صحة ذلك إذ ليس هناك منطق بالأساس يمكنك الإستناد عليه، إن خالفت القواعد فقد يُمحى وجودك بأكمله، بل يُمحى ماضيك وكأنك لم تكُن. إن السُلطة عندهم هي تمزيق العقول البشرية إلى أشلاء ثم جمعها ثانيةً وصياغتها في قوالب جديدة من إختيارهم. ليس هناك ما تُكافأ به على تقديم فروض الطاعة والولاء والإنقياد الأعمى إذ أن هذا هو واجبك الذي تُقدمه رغماً عنك.إنه عالم الخوف والغدر والتعذيب، عالم يدوس الناس فيه بعضهم بعضاً، عالم يزداد قسوة كلما ازداد نقاءً، حضارة بأكملها قائمة على الكراهية، لا مكان للعواطف غير الخوف والغضب وإذلال الذات. لا وجود للماضي إلا في السجلات، ومن المؤكد أنك لن تجد هذه السجلات فإن تزييف التاريخ والحقائق قائم على قدم وساق. تجتمع المتناقضات وعليك الإيمان بها معاً، إنه ""ازدواجية التفكير"" الذي هو من أهم مبادئ الحزب.هذا ما توقّع جورج أورويل أن الحياة ستؤول إليه في 1984، حيث تتركز السُلطة ومجريات الأمور على كافة الأصعدة في يد أقلية تُنصّب نفسها إلهاً على العامة، عن طريق خلق مُجتمع dystopia وهو النقيض التام لمفهوم المدينة الفاضلة ""اليوتوبيا"" لدى المصلحين القُدماء، دعائمه البغض والكراهية وتحويل الإنسان من كيان مُفكر إلى مُجرد آلة مصمتة خالية من المشاعر والعواطف.لا شك أن مفهوم الدولة الشمولية قد تحقق -وإن كان بصورة أقل مما نراه في الرواية- في ألمانيا النازية والشيوعية بقيادة ستالين وماركس وغيرهم، مما يجعل سيناريو كهذا مطروحاً وبقوة لأن يحدُث في أي وقت.كيف استطاع جورج أورويل أن يصف مجتمعاً شمولياً بكل جوانبه في نُقطة مستقبلية بهذا الإبداع؟ لا شك أنه مُفكر عبقري ومُحلل سياسي بارع. الرواية مؤلمة وصادمة للكثيرين، تنزف سطورها دماً وتقطع بك كُل أملٍ في مُجتمع أفلاطوني، لكنها بلاشك أفضل رواية قرأتها على الإطلاق، إنها رواية تُقرأ، ثم تُقرأ من جديد."
1679,Esma Tezgi,"Tartışmasız çok iyiydi. Kurgu çok iyiydi her şey düşünülmüş ve sağlam bir zemine oturtulmuştu. Geçmişin yok edilmesi, Partinin geçmişi istediği gibi şekle sokması ürperticiydi. İnsanı geçmişi, doğru geçmişi öğrenmeye yönlendiriyor. Mutlaka okunması gereken bir kitap."
1680,Basma Aal,"It was hard to get into at first. But then, man, what a journey this book was. A great book filled with warnings and screams toward the future. "
1681,Celeste Corrêa,"O livro 1984 de George Orwell é uma alegoria que descreve um estado totalitário onde a individualidade é sistematicamente perseguida e oprimida. Londres, 1984. Uma revolução em marcha: o reinado do Grande Irmão, ditador e líder do partido único, que tudo prevê, programa, impede o pensamento e o direito à liberdade e individualidade.A originalidade da obra de Orwell reside na aplicação de um instrumento de poder para o domínio de um povo: a Novilíngua.""Syme era filólogo, especialista em Novilíngua...fazia parte da enorme equipe de peritos empenhada na compilação da IIª edição do dicionário da Novilíngua.""""É lindo destruir palavras. Naturalmente a maior parte é nos verbos e nos adjectivos, mas há centenas de substantivos que podem perfeitamente ser eliminados. Não apenas os sinónimos; os antónimos também. Se temos a palavra bom para que precisamos de mau?""A finalidade de criar essa nova língua seria impedir que no futuro não fosse possível pensar de forma diferente do partido, pois não haveria como expressá-lo. Uma abolição de palavras, mas também uma evolução semântica das existentes, como se pode comprovar no lema do partido:“GUERRA É PAZLIBERDADE É ESCRAVIDÃOIGNORÂNCIA É FORÇA”É certo que no interior de uma língua, todas as palavras que exprimem ideia vizinhas se limitam reciprocamente: sinónimos como recear , temer, ter medo têm valor próprio apenas pela sua oposição; se recear não existisse, todo o seu conteúdo passaria para os seus rivais.A língua é uma instituição social, um código (que evolui naturalmente) e a fala é a realização individual da língua, mas Orwell concebeu um código de comunicação restrito, imutável e completamente hermético. 1984 (1949) mantém uma enorme actualidade. De modo profético, George Orwell abordou temas relevantes como a quebra da privacidade. O final não é esperançoso:“Já não corria nem dava vivas. Estava de volta ao Ministério do Amor, tudo perdoado, a alma branca de neve. Estava na tribuna dos réus, confessando tudo, implicando todos. Ia pelo corredor de ladrilhos brancos com a impressão de andar ao sol, acompanhado por um guarda armado. Por fim penetrava-lhe o crânio a bala tão esperada. Levantou a vista para o rosto enorme. Levou quarenta anos para aprender que espécie de sorriso se ocultava sob o bigode negro. Oh mal-entendido cruel e desnecessário! Oh,teimoso e voluntário exílio do peito amantíssimo! Duas lágrimas cheirando a gin escorreram de cada lado do nariz. Mas agora estava tudo em paz, tudo ótimo, acabada a luta. Finalmente vencida a batalha contra si mesmo. Amava o Grande Irmão.”"
1682,Steven C Hawkins,"Read, wait a few years then repeat.1984 is one of the saddest most depressing stories I have ever read. With that said let me tell you why it is a book everyone must read. It is the benchmark for dystopian novels and one of the greatest English-language novels of all time. It is the story of a totalitarian socialist society (“Oligarchical Collectivism”) where the party is superior to any individual or group. I read it in High School and again in college then again as a middle aged adult. Now, I have read it again as a senior adult. Each time I read it I can see our society becoming closer to the reality of 1984. For instance, the Snowden revelations have come to pass since the last time I read the book. (Can you say Big Brother is watching?) While Orwell may have missed the mark in the prediction of time he was dead on target with the policies of the progressive movement. Consider the following passage: “That it sought power because men in the mass were frail, cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth, and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves. That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better.” That sounds a lot like the current ruling elite from both parties. Orwell’s creations such as, “Doublethink”, “Newspeak”, “Thoughtcrimes” are all examples of the modern political propaganda scene. Re-education camps where they “cure” people of their “insanity” are probably not far away. If you read this book and do not see the parallels with the direction of modern government , then you are probably a “prole” or a staunch “inner party” member."
1683,Engineerrooo,مش قادر اقول اللى جوايا عن الرواية دي بصراحةغير أني اشعر ان المكان حولي اصبح اقل صخبا من زي قبل
1684,Asma,"There are books that one must read them many times so as to unfold the hidden meanings every time. 1984 is one of those novels.  it’s a wonderful novel. It really and truly depicts the terrifying life under the umbrella of Dictatorial system. And for the sake the leader controls everything in the country and prevent any attempt for uprising or acts of sabotage against him, one can expect the leader to use any means to restrain his people. Some of these vicious ways for example: recruiting one’s children to denounce their parents if they say anything bad against the BB, screens surveillance everywhere, in the offices, houses, and streets!Everything is under the control of the BB of the country, the tyrant, their minds, lives and even the minute details of pple’s lives. It’s a painful novel, you feel like you are repressed and live a very big lie in your life by keeping glorifying the leader of the country and in your heart you hate him wish him the worst but you cannot express it. "
1685,Alan,"“… sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator.” - George Orwell, 1984.In the post-Snowden world there is very little to George Orwell’s “1984"" that seems unlikely now, but every time I re-read it I am also struck by some of the non-political aspects of his future visions made in 1949. This time it was about pop music being composed by automated means. Unfortunately that is what a lot of modern music sounds like to me, but maybe I am just dating myself ;) Anyway, this audiobook performance by Simon Prebble was outstanding and his narration suited all the voices very well."
1686,Rogers Hartmann,Re-read it. Still so poignant and clever. Did not realize that Orwell died so young. 
1687,JK,"This book terrifies me, and always has done.Orwell gives light to a totalitarian regime in a dystopian world that makes the likes of Hitler and Stalin look like pussies. Everything is controlled by the government - working, eating, talking - and even the most minor unorthodox thought can be detected through a variety of different technologies or groups.What scared me most about this novel is the idea that the past does not exist. All evidence we have of the past exists in only written records and memories. What if these are false? What if both of these can be controlled?Although 1984 has now been and gone (I wasn't even a figment of imagination at this time), it is hard to believe that this novel was first published in 1949 as a projection of the future. Although there are clear nods to Stalinist Russia, anyone reading the book now could quite easily find stark parallels to life as we know it today, and I believe even ten, or twenty years on, this may still be the case. It's essentially about propaganda, how this affects society, and how powerful it can be when put to use by government.The ending was quite surreal, although I feel this was intended due to our protagonist's experiences.It's absolutely timeless, and will no doubt remain a classic for an incredibly long time. It's so influential, not to mention important, and I feel as technology rapidly progresses it's a novel that will become more real year after year. I'd encourage people to read this, or even to re-read it. I read it when I was in school and after reading it again I've gained a much different perspective than I did years ago. It's quite the cultural point of reference, and along with Animal Farm, is a good place to begin your Orwellian experience."
1688,Aurelio,"Una de obra de impacto, directa a la lógica; miedo, esperanza, erudición, clímax y horror, ese ha sido el camino por el que me ha llevado el genio de Eric Arthur Blair.Comienza a plasmarte un futuro lógico con un personaje capaz, aparentemente, de tener una visión parcialmente distinta, con anhelos. El protagonista pasa del odio al amor y de la creencia lejana de rebelión a la consciencia de la existencia de un plan, de un modo de rebeldía.Todo con un trasfondo de precisión terrorífica.El clímax de la novela nos viene precedido por la escena mas bella de la obra, con los protagonistas viendo la esperanza de su mundo en los proles, justo después comienza a desvelarse la triste realidad.Los protagonistas se reencuentran después del proceso, han instaurado en ellos los fundamentos de pensamiento del partido, son capaces de odiar y de amar al mismo tiempo y todo lo que se dijeron, las palabras de esperanza en lo mas recóndito de su ser se despedazan a nuestros ojos, pero lo peor, lo mas espeluznante, es que lo entendemos perfectamente.En la última parte, Principios de nuevalengua, el narrador nos educa, de forma erudita, en los fundamentos lingüísticos del cambio, quizás haciéndonos ver, por los tiempos usados, que después de la historia, de algún modo, todo volvió a su cauce.Es tiempo, siempre lo ha sido, de pensar en nuestros días, qué estamos viviendo, de qué manera tan implacable nos están controlando, cómo vemos los pasos certeros hacia la centralización y la sencillez con la que ya pueden controlar qué pensamos y en gran media los medios por los que llegamos a pensarlo."

1690,Leen,"Wow. Just, wow.I’ve spend a very long time thinking how I can explain what this book made me feel. I wasn’t expecting a lot when I started reading, definitely because I read a very old edition with a lot of spelling mistakes, but once I got a few chapters into the book and was able to look further than the old grammar, it really got to me. It made me feel terrified and fascinated at the same time. It was a scary book, but not in the usual way. It really made me think about things. What if something like this actually happened? I can’t imagine what it must be like to not be allowed to have your own opinion. Not only the entire concept of the book, but also the way everything was described made me feel very scared. I didn’t like the characters in particular. To be honest, I disliked quite a lot of the characters. For example Julia. I thought she was very arrogant, and maybe even a bit narrow-minded, despite her hate against the Party. She hated them, but she didn’t seem to care for other things besides her own pleasure. I didn’t really dislike Winston, but I just didn’t really like him that much. I did feel quite sorry for him. At first I liked O’Brien, but for obvious reasons that didn’t last very long.The most terrifying part of the book was the ending. There’s a part in the book where Winston says that to be able to die while hating the party would be freedom. That’s why the last sentence in particular really scared me, because he didn’t die in freedom after all. Throughout the entire book, he had been able to keep his hate for the party alive, sometimes he hated them more, sometimes less, but it was always there. He was able to stick to his own opinion, despite everything they had done to him, he kept on being himself. But at the end, even he, Winston Smith, who had always hated the Party so deeply, wasn’t able to die in freedom. He died as a part of the Party, not as himself. This scared me, because it showed that the Party can even brainwash the most self-determined people.I really loved this book. It was terrifying, but it was also so well written and clever that it’s almost impossible not to love it. It’s the kind of book that keeps you thinking, much more than just an enjoyable read."

1694,Alice Yu,"1984 warns us against the psychological manipulation by totalitarianism control. The book reminds me most of North Korea, as we were studying totalitarianism countries recently, and this book is definitely one of my top-used references. The oppressive force enabled the use of technology to control their citizens, as they altered history and manipulated minds. The most extreme, but imaginable society of the modern world from this book reflected the potential threat a communism nation could propose. This book really reminds me of the communism country we live in right now (a.k.a China). Apparently the government is now struggling in a series of 'INNER FIGHTING', and Xi Jin Ping had control over the nation similar to how Hitler controlled Germany during WW2. I don't know if the people have noticed it yet (apparently they are too much 'occupied') but anyways I really enjoyed this book so yeah :D.Dang so deep and depressing though. Even though the ending was so predictable. Someone died. But still. "

1696,Jo,"I honestly can’t believe it took me so long to get onto Orwell. It seems that everyone in Britain seems to have studied either Animal Farm or 1984 in their GCSE English classes.Except me.So I know it’s not an excuse. But it’s the one I’m using. To be honest, I’m quite glad that I didn’t read it within class. I think this is the kind of book that would have been ruined by studying it in classes. Although, Orwell has a pretty nifty page on Spark Notes. (view spoiler)[ A website that I completely didn’t rely on through my GCSE exams. (hide spoiler)]Even though I had never read anything of his, (my first Orwell experience was my final year at uni when we read Coming Up for Air for my British Writer’s in the 1930s module and I absolutely adored it) I knew the basic gist of what he was about. After god-knows how many series of the reality TV show Big Brother (though, I hear it’s the last series soon, yes? YES!), the comedy show Room 101 and staring blankly at my lecturer when they described a book as ‘Orwellian’ (a quick visit to Google sorted me out)... it has been impossible to avoid the effect of Orwell on our culture.Jo Brand stated that 1984 was “More relevant to today than almost any other book that you can think of”. Looking at the situation that Britain is at the moment, it is eerie how much of this Orwell actually predicted and I can't help agree with Ms Brand.The 24/7 surveillance, the greedy men in power who rely on dirty tricks to remain where they are, the shocking class division and the pointless constant wars that no one understands/ remembers why they were started in the first place. Like Brand says, 1984 remains relevant as all these factors are plaguing the Britain we live now.I found that 1984 read more like an essay because if you think about it; in the first part of the novel... nothing happens. At all. And I don’t mean that as a bad thing as Orwell’s writing is mesmerizing and his descriptions of the inner workings of the dystopic Oceania are nothing short of genius. He relies on realistic descriptions of things that could feasibly happen like the telescreens that have been installed into every citizens house. With all these CCTV cameras and traffic camera are we, in 2010, really that far away from having cameras placed in our home?1984 is such an important novel, especially when you consider that it was written 40 years before it was set. Orwell died the year after 1984 was published and so never really got to see the effect this novel had on British culture. I would like to know what he would think of the government now, especially in regards to the state of the politics of Britain at the moment.I would also like to know what he would think about Davina McCall. Or what he'd put into Room 101.. I'm going to take a guess and say Spark Notes..... and Channel 4."
1697,Luis Fernando Franco,"Es una de las novelas más tristes que he leído, sin duda.Me llama la atención cómo la gente se queda unicamente con la visión de que la vigilancia continua de los ciudadanos por parte del gobierno es lo más importante de la novela. Quizás se deba a que solo repiten lo que han escuchado en medios de comunicación ad infinitum.A mi me pareció muchísimo más interesante lo que El Partido pretendía hacer con el lenguaje, y cómo modificando el lenguaje, se puede modificar el pensamiento, en el largo plazo. Esto además, tiene bases científicas sólidas, recuerdo que leí un artículo sobre cómo algunos pueblos eslavos (creo) podían percibir más colores que los que vemos los occidentales, por el simple hecho de tener más palabras para describir los colores.Lo siguiente que más me gustó, es el estado de paranoía que genera el no saber nunca qué es verdad y qué es mentira, por el control de los medios y la verdad única; o peor aún saber que no se sabe qué es verdad y qué es mentira.El final es terrible por toda la implicación de la destrucción de (view spoiler)[Winston, y francamente pensé que terminaría de otra forma, pensé que la invasión que estaba presenciando en la telepantalla sería real, derrotarían a Oceanía, surgiría un nuevo poder, pero sería igual. Sin embargo, es más consistente con la historia pensar que lo que estaba ocurriendo quizás ni siquiera estaba ocurriendo y no era más que otra manipulación de El Partido, por lo que el final termina siendo desgarrador (hide spoiler)]Otra cosa que generalmente obvian nuestros medios de comunicación es la durísima crítica que se hace al sistema socialista/comunista y es un reflejo de las fantasías con las que -se dice- vivían en la Unión Soviética.Con todo lo anterior, creo que 1984 se coloca entre mis novelas favoritas."
1698,Thomas Strömquist,"For some reason, I've always been partial to Brave New World in the very defined genre (also containing We, This Perfect Day and Kallocain in my opinion - more suggestions welcome!)But Orwell is undoubtedly a masterful author and very ahead of his time, in more ways than actually shows in this novel. And, no, I'm not going to say a word of what's it about. If you haven't read it already - congratulations, you have a great experience ahead of you!"

1700,hissi,"This has got to be the best book I read this year. It has just the right number of pages, words and ink. Precisely to get the plot with all it's messages to the reader without any excess baggage of empty words or shallow conversations. The story is saturated with complexed ideas. So keep an open mind and delve in its realm. Even if you get depressed (that's what happened to me) in spite of the melancholy world, I was so immersed. I savored every word to its fullest. to the point where I didn't want to read it all at once. I kept reading and re-reading parts that I loved (like: their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the party, it was a political act)! I couldn't help but wonder how smart the author must've been. He keeps creating worlds parallel to our world in his novels. Imaginary. Futuristic world that was so set backed. He was foreseeing the future of communism and other similar political parties. He Never failed to get his message through even after sugar coating the whole truth. You'd bite into it and taste what the author wanted you to taste and feel what he wanted you to feel. But most importantly. To make you see and understand what he thoughts and understood. His own truth. A piece of himself has been embedded within these pages. "
1701,Michelle,"George Orwell’s 1984 captivated me with its powerful and astounding novel. I found 1984 to be a classic book on the shelves of political issues. “WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.” Can you imagine seeing those bold words everywhere you go? Having a government with complete control on every aspect of your life and even thoughts? Whatever you are doing whether it be sleeping, eating, writing, talking and even thinking, you are being watched by the leader and dictator, Big brother, may I add, more harsh than Hitler. Individuality is not a choice for Big Brother.The main theme of the book is to warn the people of what can happen when the government is given too much power. Power can sometimes be too much that it can be abused. The book is set in the ruling Party in London, in the nation of Oceania in 1984. The main character is Winston Smith a frustrated thirty nine year old man. Winston’s frustration is clearly shown throughout the novel, as he secretly goes against society and purchases a diary in which he writes all his criminal thoughts in. Winston secretly hates Big Brother which is the face of the party. Winston too craves love so much that he meets Julia at his work and begins a hidden affair that causes them too always have to lookout for Big Brother’s monitoring. As you read, you will get to know a lot about what goes on in Winston’s head and feelings even though it is outlawed to express yourself and of how it is the worst human society imaginable.As I had just previously mentioned, this is an astounding novel about demonstrating the most extreme realization of a totalitarian society. So, I clearly gave this book five stars because the author has a very unique way of giving his characters life and leaving you constantly on the edge of your chair, just craving what was going to happen next to Winston’s rebellion against society and his feelings that are monitored by Big Brother. Just how Big Brother had the power of controlling personal rights, the author too has a way of “controlling” you to keep on reading. This book is great for those who are into the political authority."
1702,Kritarth Jha,"If you're the kind who reads one book a year, read this one. If you read 2, read it again.The Sheer evil portrayed in this book in the dystopic future shown to you by Orwell will Shake you to the bone like ""The Exorcist"" never could! Power, corruption, surveillance, trust both found and broken, survival; this book has it all .Once you're done with this book,Your life will never be the same again. "
1703,Hanno Willers,"Still brilliant on a second read-through. I had partly forgotten some of the finer elements in the art of tyranny, but the completeness of the process when compared to real-world examples is what sets it apart. When the ideal is absolute power, then power will be utilised absolutely. I still find myself thinking of (and agreeing with) a picture I saw with a CCTV camera and a caption that said ""1984 was supposed to be a warning, not a guide"". Oh so true."
1704,Crystal,"This book is a frightening portrayal of a society in which people give up their individual freedoms to the government. It is also a perfect example of why we must not become complacent and content with mediocrity, and of why individual thoughts, feelings and ideas are all equally valuable. "
1705,Deven Navani,"WAR IS PEACE.FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.Those words keep sounding in my head since I started this book. George Orwell's style of writing is impressive and unique in its own way. 1984 describes a utopia. Working, eating, drinking, sleeping, talking, thinking, procreating...all are controlled by the state. Any hint of obedience or dislike can be detected by various state apparatus such as the Thought Police, the telescreen, or even your children, who will not hesitate to betray you to the authorities. The past is controlled, rewritten into something that will strengthen the incumbent ruler. Who controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present, controls the past. There is no real truth. The ""truth"" is what the state says it is. Black is white. 1+2=4 if the state says it does. There is no arguing. The world in 1984 is divided into three states, Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia. Continuous warfare between those three is required to keep the society's order and peace. The second slogan, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, means the only way to be free is by letting you lose yourself and to be integrated within the Party. That way, you'll be indestructible and immortal.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH, means the division on high, middle, low classes in society will never be changed. The middle wants to be the high and they'll act ""on behalf of the low"" to dethrone the high. Afterwards, a new middle class arises, all will change except the low. The high and middle make and uphold the law, the low (proletarian) is just too stupid to revolt. The state maintains its structure by torture, intimidation, violence, and brainwashing.Orwell's Animal Farm might be depressing, but 1984 gives ""depression"" a WHOLE new meaning. I'm currently on Chapter 2 of this book, which is about 1/3 of the way in. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a captivating and somewhat ""horrific"" read. "
1706,Clarissa,A work of fiction that is frighteningly like non-fiction. Orwell's negative utopia compels you from the first page all the way to the last. 
1707,Sven Mysterioso,"Doublethink. Cognitive dissonance as an actual, perceived and understood thing.We have always been at war with Oceania.What can I possibly say about this story, about this writer, about the style and delivery that can do it justice. I would need to channel whatever genius Orwell himself tapped into. This is a timeless story about the evils of control and ownership in society.You can compare and contrast this against any governmental body anywhere at anytime. It is majestic in its scope and flawless in its delivery. Doubleplusgood, newspeak, and doublethink are real things that have been named and defined here in this tome. The very concept of limiting free thought by dissolving language itself is unbelievable. It is true evil. And done so well here.I haven't even mentioned Big Brother, the most ubiquitous and reused concept coined in this piece. Nor did we bring up the societal references, from the definitive Apple commercial to the reality CCTV show.This dystopian nightmare is a fundamental political and sociological tome that is important. Simply it is one of the MOST important books on the subject and genres that has ever been written in the modern day. I am very thankful they force average high schoolers to dive into it, and again (and again) in the underclassmen years. It is vital to the education of an awake and aware society.Orwell teaches us what happens if you fail to watch the watchmen."
1708,Riccardo,"A 'one of a kind' book. Extremely well thought, it initially rather reminded me of Dominion by C.J. Sansom (which was of course written after 1984!); but about 2/3 in, it took a completely different turn. A more realistic one, I dare say. This book questions reality at its very roots and its thought provoking ideals will make a mark on you. Mostly as it is not very far from the truth in some countries. The way the population can be suppressed and constrained, without them even knowing, is truly mind blowing and, honestly, frightening.A book everyone ought to read to sharpen their minds and open their eyes."
1709,Parveen Harnam,"This book is a modern masterpiece. I probably do not have to mention that, it's a given with a book like this. I appreciate it so much more because it took me almost 2 years to actually find it in a bookstore! Recently 500 teachers have rated it No. 1 on the must-read book list. It is that and much more. I doubt I can say something about it that hasn't already been said, but I would like to believe that each person appreciates this book differently. The values it preaches, the frustrations Winston expresses is all so palpable. I became so involved in this bleak idea of a civilisation, so obsessed with the whole thing, I was having vivid dreams about thoughtcrime and life in Oceania. I guess that speaks more for George Orwell more than it does me. There is a lot to this book that would probably take me some time to truly understand and take in. It is without a doubt one of my favourite books now, possibly the best book I have ever read. Winston is not a particularly heroic or special character, he doesn't even have any real emotion for anyone, I think that makes the character all the more realistic. His one and only true passion and feeling is his heretic views, which made me love this character fervently. He is different from almost everyone else, he is able to see his world for what it really is and that made this book a winner in my eyes. My two favourite moments in this book would be the time he read ""Goldstein's book"". He felt almost felt ""happiness"" then. I also liked the lady, a prole, who sings and dries clothes , in Winston's hiding place. These two moments in the book are almost anomalies when compared with the tone of the rest of the book. The ending is not something I liked very much, but I am trying to come to grips with it. I felt as though he lost his very identity, which I think is the purpose of the world of Oceania. Maybe in years to come I will understand that aspect of the book. As a whole, this is a great read and is ever relevant and will never lose meaning. It is the embodiment of our worst fears. 1984 will live on, for hundreds of years to come. "

1712,Seanf,"For those readers who like to read about possible futures of politcs. Granted this book was written in 1948, the insights that occur in it were definitely ahead of its time.  Based in an extreme socialist society(Oceana), the protagonist has to find his individuality in a society that frowns upon such thoughts. Along the way he finds a youthful women to aid in his journey. Everything seems to be going well, until the couple is caught for breaking one of the worst laws in this society-thoughtcrime. This only leads to further problems and a twist ending that is obvious, but only if one pays attention to the foreshadowing. Orwell does an excellent job in engaging the reader with his language and style of writing. One aspect that helps is the language that is invented specifically for his fictional society. He develops a plethora of simple words that are 'made-up' by the Big Brother in the book. The idea of this language, within the story line, is to make it so that the citizens of the society are not able to formulate their own interpretations of different words. Some of the words that are made include: thoughtcrime-thinking of ideas that aren't given to you by Big Brother; doublespeak-the name of the language that is developer, and thoughtpolice- the most feared people in this society. Overall, this book is tastefully written, and keeps the reader invovled and feeling symapathetic for the protagonists. On the downside, when one peruses this book, if not totally involved it is very easy to become perplexed by what is occuring. I definitely recommend it to any interested in any type of politcal fiction."
1713,J.,"This is again one fo those books one can never forget. Original and terrifying plot, with twist where you don't expect them, and an even more shocking and tragic ending."
1714,Marion,This review and rating comes from my high school mind because I did my research paper on this book and loved it!
1715,Mieczyslaw Kasprzyk,"Another masterpiece of SF. Dystopian tales are meant to disturb us and make us look at our society with new, more critical eyes. Here, Orwell shows his disillusion with the dictatorial systems that have ruled and (at the time of writing) do rule large parts of Europe. I feel that this book has to be read at the same time as ""Brave New World"" so that we can appreciate how the world we live in is a sort of synthesis of the two. It is interesting how disfunctional Orwell's world is (and how that reflects the disfunctionality of the old totalitarian regimes of Eastern Europe). Such a world can only exist under very tight controls, with no outside forces pressing against it. There will always be Winston Smiths who start to lose their faith in the Party and the system, especially when, like him, they are part of the machinery that creates it."
1716,Sadowski,"1984 is a book that can be called a classic unchallenged. Many of my classmates who read the book complained of it being dry and uninteresting however after finishing the book I felt like that was farthest from fact. The book had a certain fluidity to the characters and plot that are only paralleled in very few books. The story took awhile to fully set up due to the intricacies of George Orwell's Oceania yet he skillfully captured the monotony on life in a way that made Winston¨s reality seem feasible.The book follows Winston, a government worker who is highly disillusioned with the government. He struggles to choose to rebel against the government who constantly watches it citizens or remain quiet and never be killed. However, he finds his voice when he begins to have a relationship with another government worker. Doing that alone is a crime there. I liked how the book did not contain a plot on the surface level but it was carried through on the scenery and imagery that Orwell produced. I also thought it was brilliant to have the enemy of the state had the possibly of being fabricated by the government the enemy opposes. After reading this book I and hooked on George Orwell's books. It is a 5/5 book."

Tiene muchas lecturas y enfoques, desde el cuestionamiento casi filosófico sobre lo que es la realidad, el pasado y el tiempo, hasta el obvio reflejo de la sociedad actual con su control de medios y la vigilancia del gobierno. Una de las cosas que más me sorprendió cuando lo leí por primera vez es el final, tan cargado de cruda realidad, y que toda esperanza de una posible rebelión contra el Partido no era más que otra forma de control (¿a alguien le suena ""Matrix""?). Si bien no pierde vigencia lo relacionado al ""Hermano Mayor"" (mal traducido Gran Hermano en muchas versiones) y a la política, también se destacan las preguntas relacionadas con el pensamiento individual, la independencia de los sentimientos y la verdadera (¿falsa?) capacidad de independencia del ser humano."

1731,Travis Bughi,"So I missed the 2013 revitalization of this novel when everyone and their mother was picking this old classic up under the wake of the NSA leaks, but I put it on my to-read list determined to get around to it at some point.And damn am I glad I did.1984 follows a middle-aged man named Winston through a dystopian world of extreme totalitarianism. The government controls absolutely everything and monitors its people to prevent any of them from revolting against the Party in control. And by control everything, I do mean everything. They even re-write the past to suit their efforts.Before I get to the lessons in this book, which surely everyone is mostly interested in, I want to address the novel's storytelling, world building, and pacing. I just want to state that all three were fantastic, with the world building being especially deep and detailed. Orwell did a fantastic job of paying attention to all the finer points of living in such a society he imagined that I had no troubles at all immersing myself in this man-made hell. Really excellent stuff and it helped me to get into the story and see the messages he was trying to send.Mostly, 1984 is a warning about power, particularly the power of thought. The government in 1984 is aware of how dangerous it is for people to think independently and so actively tries to control thoughts and actions, going so far as to dumb down speech so that people will one day be incapable of expressing revolution. It's truly ingeniously wicked stuff, though, as the Soviet Union proved, doomed to fail in a real world application. Despite this, many parallels in our own society can be drawn and lessons can be learned. In particular, I saw a lot of examples with organized religion. Thought police sound a lot like the religious police of the Middle East these days, and of course the NSA seems less like a tool to stop terrorism and more like a weapon to silence those who disagree with the government.SPOILERS: I want to take a moment to address the fact that 1984 doesn't offer a point of view we haven't heard before. There's the movie Enemy of the State and V for Vendetta for example, but 1984 is particularly interesting because the protagonists lose. The government is not overthrown, the people are successfully controlled, and although the novel doesn't mention it, one day the sun expands and swallows earth whole and all of humanity perishes because of the pursuit of power over itself.But do I think any of this will happen? No. Not so long as the internet remains a free and open platform for speech, 1984 will always remain a work of fiction. Knowledge and communication are the great unifiers or our time, allowing anyone to instantly connect and talked with people all over and learn things they might never have known. The internet is the ultimate free speech platform and should remain that way. Thanks to the internet, humanity has become aware of how ignorant it is and is slowly working to change that. Some governments, in response, have attempted to control the internet such as Russia's recent banning and then un-banning of wikipedia and reddit so long as the two websites agree to censor their data. Terrible stuff, and I fear we have a great battle ahead of us that I only hope we can reign over.But I'm totally getting off subject here. Damn 1984 book, making me think! Anwyay, yeah, read this book if you haven't yet. It's some intoxicating stuff!"

1733,Isra' Arafat,"رواية ما أن تبدأ بقراءتها حتى تشعر بزلزال يضربُ جذور وعيك ويُتبعه بهزات ارتدادية تأتي على شكل مجموعة إسقاطات ومقارنات مع واقعك ومحيطك ومجتمعك.."" انتبه : الأخ الكبير يراقبك!""هذه العبارة التي لخّص بها أورويل جوهر النظام الشمولي –نظام الحزب الواحد أو الفرد الواحد- بما يتضمنه من حصار للأفكار، وكبت للغرائز، واستلاب للحريات، يُرافق ذلك آليات صناعة الخوف وتزوير الحقائق وطمس الماضي واحتكار الحاضر..يروي أورويل في هذه الرواية فلسفة السلطة المطلقة التي تُطلب لذاتها حيثُ يقول على لسان أحد أعضاء الحزب: ""إنّ الحزب يسعى إلى بلوغ السلطة لذاتها وإنّ مصالح الآخرين لا تعنينا في شيء، فكلّ همنا محصور في السلطة. نحن لا نسعى وراء الثروة ولا الرفاهية ولا العمر المديد ولا السعادة وإنما نسعى وراء السلطة والسلطة المطلقة فقط"".يروي أورويل أيضاً الكيفية التي يتم بها إعادة تشكيل الوعي الجمعي بالواقع باستخدام أساليب التضليل والخداع والتفكير المزدوج، وذلك بهدف تدمير ذاتية الإنسان ووعيه الفردي ليتشكل بعدها بالطريقة التي تخدم أهداف الحزب ومصالحه: "" إنّ الواقع ليس له وجود خارجي، إنّ الواقع موجود في العقل البشري ولا يوجد في مكان سواه، إنه ليس موجوداً في العقل الفردي الذي هوَ عرضة للوقوع بالأخطاء، كما أنّه يفنى بفناء صاحبه، إنّه لا يوجد إلا في عقل الحزب الذي يتسم بأنّه جماعي وخالد. وما يعتبره الحزب حقيقة فهو الحقيقة التي لا مراء فيها، ومن المستحيل أن ترى الحقيقة إلا بالنظر من خلال عيني الحزب"".ذكرتني هذه الرواية بعبارة كتبتها مع بداية اندلاع الثورات العربية وهيَ تمثّل نموذجاً حياً لديكتاتوريات الأخ الكبير بإصدارها العربي: """"تونس بن علي""، ""مصر مبارك""، ""ليبيا القذافي""، ""يَمنُ صالح""، سوريا الأسد""فلتخلعوا عنكم ديباجة الديكتاتوريات المتوارثة، فهذي الأوطان تجاوزت أسماءَ جلاديها واحتفظت بحقّ النسبِ إلى أحضانِ أبناءها الأحرار.""واستحضرتُ من خلال سرد أورويل حالة الثورات المضادة والدوافع التي تشكلت من خلالها: ""المرء لا يُقيم حكماً استبدادياً لحماية الثورة، وإنما يشعل الثورة لإقامة حكم استبدادي"".هيَ باختصار رواية تُحاكي طبيعة الأنظمة الشمولية في كلّ الأزمة تقرأ ثمّ تُقرأ من جديد.مما أعجبني بين طيات الرواية:-""الحرية هيَ حرية القول إن انثنين واثنين يساويان أربعة، فإذا سُلم بذلك سار كلّ شيء آخر في مساره السليم.""-وفكّرت جوليا في كلامه ثمّ قالت بشكل قاطع: لا يُمكنهم أن يبلغوا ذلك، فذلك هو الشيء الوحيد الذي لا يستطيعونه، إذ بوسعهم أن يُكرهوك على قول أيّ شيء يريدونه، ولكنهم لا يستطيعون إكراهك على أن تؤمن بما تقول، فليس لهم سلطة ينفذون بها إلى كيانك.فقال وقد لمع على وجهه شعاع من الأمل: لا، ليسَ لديهم. صحيح تماماً. إنهم لا يستطيعون النفاذ إلى قلبك. وإذا استطاع المرء أن يشعر بأنّ بقاءه إنساناً هو أمر يستحق التضحية من أجله، حتى لو لم يؤد ذلك إلى نتيجة، فإنه يكون قد ألحق بهم الهزيمة."""
1734,خُزامَى,رواية كهذه تستحق أن تعيش مابقي من عمرك لساعات قليلة لقراءتها، حتى و إن كانت أمنيتك اﻷخيرة قبل موتك.ﻷنك عندما تقرأها و تتخيل لو كنت ونستون ستعلم أنك محظوظ أنك لست هو.و كم أنك كنت غارق في نعمة أن تحيا و أنت لست ونستون.و لم تسمع يوما بما يسمى اﻷخ الكبير، و أن تجبر على القول و التصديق بأن 2+2=5.و أن الحرية هي العبودية، و الحرب هي السلام.و أن يقدر أحدهم على التغلغل في باطن عقلك و يخبرك أنه يفكر عنك و يحب عنك و يكره عنك.أنت جسد فقط بلا روح و فكر، أنت كالدمية يحركك أينما أراد.و أنا أقرأ يأست و بردت و جعت و كرهت و اشمئزت نفسي مع ونستون...و حتى أنني رأيت أوبراين خلاصي و نجاتي رغم أنه معذبي.هنا عندما تقترب من النهاية تختنق ضيقا و تحتقن بكاء و ما تلبث حتى تصير لا تبالي و تشعر بجفاف روحك قبل فمك، لا يهمك إن مت بعد ثوان أو بعد عام، ﻷنك لست موجود. (هل نحن هكذا ...أيعيش بيننا المئات و ربما الملايين من الهاتفين زورا بولائهم ، الجبناء يخافون إظهار غضبهم و يقمعون حريتهم و حقوقهم الإنسانية؟أيعقل أن معنا من سيصدق إن قال له واليه أو سلطته أن 2+2=5.!)أوريل شفقت عليك عندما كتبتها، كم من المرات شعرت بالوحدة و الظلام و قشعريرة خوف و ضعف يغتالك.و كما قلت في بدء اﻷمر هي رواية تجعلك تتسائل :لماذا لم أقرأها من قبل ؟
1735,Luigui Valdivia,"“If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—for ever.” Hay tantas frases y extractos de 1984 que es imposible poder elegir una sobre otra y probablemente esta sea una de las más poderosas, al ser directa, realista y certera. Por otro lado, releer una de mis novelas favoritas, ocho años después, significa siempre sumergirse nuevamente en toda abrasividad, el nihilismo y la desesperanza que se sienten en cada una de las páginas de esta obra maestra del siglo XX. Es encontrar nuevos significados, interpretaciones más coherentes, actitudes en los personajes con los que el lector logra empatizar e identificarse, y llenándose de total impotencia ante el inveitable destino de estos, e incluso con los devaneos filosóficos y por momentos metafísicos de O'Brien, una de las piezas clave de todo el engranaje orwelliano. Demás está decir que la tercera parte siempre es la más angustiosa, reflexiva y poderosa de toda la novela, y, a mi opinión, uno de los puntos álgidos de toda la literatura universal. "
1736,Katy Noyes,"The father, or dare I say it, 'big brother' of all contemporary dystopian novelsI read this at 17 when studying A-Levels, and seeing it recently adapted at the theatre I had a hankering to revisit it, half my life later. It only grows more impressive with age, it really does. It's a classic for a reason, it's shattering, powerful and absolutely unforgettable.This audiobook, narrated by the excellent Samuel West, gives us the voice of not only Orwell, but the lowly yet rebellious Winston Smith and those of his oppressors - the Party. A very effective way of accessing the book.In what may be the dystopian fiction that all others since either build on, imitate or pay homage to, Winston Smith works and lives in the dreary and oppressive world dominated by the Party, who control rations, leisure time, and watch each citizen constantly through state-sanctioned TV screens. Trying out his own small acts of rebellion, WInston is our eyes and ears on this horrendous world, one only a few steps away from our own. The whole creation of Winston's society in Oceania, forever at war with one of the other two great powers, is exquisite. We even gain access to inner-Party literature that explains how the officials have organised their systems to oppress and maintain control. And of course, Orwell is a modern Shakespeare in adding cultural reference points to the language that everybody will know but knot necessarily know the source of - Big Brother, Room 101, thought crime. One of the most important books you'll ever read, and be thankful it's 'just' a fiction..."

1739,Mariam Hamad,تمت كتابة هذه الرواية خلال أربعينيات القرن العشرين، لذلك كان أثر الحرب العالمية الثانية التي وضعت أوزارها والنازية التي استولت على مشاعر الناس في ذلك الوقت والقوة السوفييتية المتصاعدة لهم أكبر تأثير على خيال الكاتب فيما لو تحكمت قوة دكتاتورية بدولة حرة مثل بريطانيا. يتناول الكاتب بخيال مُبْهر وسابق لعصره الوسائل التي يمكن أن تلجأ لها الحكومة المستبدة لمراقبة مواطنيها وإحصاء أفكارهم وأنفاسهم تقريبا. وكيف يُزيف الوعي والتاريخ والمشاعر لضمان استمرارية وأمن هذه الحكومة. ومن ثم بأسلوب يسبر النفس البشرية كيف يُمكن إعادة برمجة أي ثائر عليهم ليكون موالياً وبحب كذلك! الفصول التي أوردت من كتاب جولدشتاين تحوي فلسفة الحزب الحاكم؛ استمرارية الحرب لضمان استمرارية السلطة. لا أتخيل عالماً تُطبق فيه هذه النظريات بحذافيرها، لن يكون عالماً بل مقبرة على قيد الحياة. رغم ذلك أجد الكثيرين يُبجلون هذه الرواية ويتخيلون أن كل حكومة هم غير راضين عنها هي نسخة ما من حكومة الأخ الأكبر، أعتقد أنها أصبحت شماعة الساخطين على حكوماتهم، ودائما من السهل اكتشاف إسقاطات من الواقع على الرواية. جاهدت نفسي كثيرا لأصل إلى منتصف الكتاب ومن بعد ذلك بدأت الأحداث تتوالى وتصبح مشوقة (قرأت النصف الأول في أكثر من أسبوع والنصف الثاني في أقل من يوم!) 
1740,Jason,"This is one of those books that truly changed how I see the world. Unfortunately, not really in a good way. The most frightening book I've ever read."
1741,Anthony North,"Orwell's 1984 is about as perfect as a novel can be - dystopian science fiction(?), political thriller, romance, psychological thriller and the horrors of man more frightening than any typical horror novel.Of course, we're told it's a warning, not a prophecy - yeah! right - but with Big Brother, Room 101, Doublethink, Newspeak and that infamous slogan - 'War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength' - we must not forget how subtle and prophetic the final element is. For after brainwashing, Smith finally submits to the 'system' himself - a form of acceptance.Related to today - how so much seems to have come true - I must conclude that if we give the sheeple enough comfort and incentive, we become Big Brother, and Sister, ourselves, which makes 1984 prophetic, indeed.And hark! A clock strikes 13."

1744,Michael Rozek,"One of the best books that I read in high school. It's shockingly horrifying how Orwell's and Ray Bradbury's books are prophetic and coming to fruition . . . an unfortunate, rotten fruition. This is one of the indispensable books every person needs to read in their literature classes . . . right next to Fahrenheit 451. "
1745,Phara Sotya Satria,"Dalam novel ini, menulis buku harian dan berhubungan seks bebas dapat mengundang para polisi rahasia mendobrak pintu kamarmu. Mereka akan menyeretmu ke bilik-bilik penyiksaan, menghancurkan penampilanmu, membuatmu berguling-guling tidak tahu malu berkubang kotoranmu sendiri, hingga kau menyesali kesalahanmu kepada Bung Besar, dan percaya bahwa dua kali dua sama dengan lima. Jika ada angin perubahan bagi negara yang setiap gerak warga dipelajari, setiap kata disadap, dan setiap pemikiran dikendalikan, tentu itu dihembuskan oleh kaum kelas bawah. Sayang, mereka terlalu disibukkan dengan minuman-minuman murah, cerita-cerita kuno, dan rumus menghitung nomor buntut. 1984 merupakan salah satu karya George Orwell yang penting, yang mana membacanya membuat tidur saya tidak lagi nyenyak. Menawan."
1746,Ashita Thakur,"I read this book around a month ago and did not think myself to be in possession of a mental state which might enable me to say something about this. I can still remember my reaction when I finished this and the way that my roommates were worried for my sanity because I was so upset over a book. BUT what a book.A totalitarian government where people are taught to be feelingless, heartless, devoid of the right to use their own brains has been a subject of many books now. The Giver (mention because I Just finished reading it) spoke about this and many other contemporary novels have adopted the idea, but none...i believe NO ONE of them spooked the bejeezus out of me like this one did. I grew to care about this character, I was almost happy about the way his life was panning out. But his defeat against the system depressed me to bits, as did the fact that (view spoiler)[ the one person he had trusted, broke him. And the one person he had loved betrayed him as he betrayed her. Not to mention the intense torture he went through.  (hide spoiler)] This one  made me pull out my hair  upset me. Yes 1984 has long been gone, yes we have 'precautionary' institutions that shall not let this become a reality, but the possibility of such a world ever existing is something that might give this girl a heart attack.Of course, any one who reads a bit does perchance come to read this book and this review will just be lost in a sea of thousands, but I felt a dire need to say something about this and so I did. Also, stranger who is reading this: i'd relish any and all book suggestions."
1747,Ypres,Limitarse a considerar que este libro es una sátira de la Rusia estalinista es no haber comprendido la novela.
1748,Avidreader86,"George Orwell's 1984 is a telling story about how the power of the state overcomes the inner power each individual holds. Individuality is crushed by The Party and the haunting image of Big Brother by taking away individual freedoms through hatred, terror, fear, and the destruction of love, peace, knowledge, and the natural connections that human beings have for one another. Any meaningful connection one human being has with another is never realized due to the scrutiny and harsh laws of The Party. A thought provoking read, this novel unveils how those in power exercise authority to the detriment of individualistic people. Those few who do not conform are broken into believing everything The Party wants them to believe. The minds of strong people such as Winston Smith and Julia are broken into dust, only to follow what The Party directs. The novel shows how people in power will manipulate others, destroy their beliefs, their knowledge, and ultimately the freedom to think for oneself. This is a brilliant story of how those who want to gain or remain in power try to brainwash those who defy their authority. P. 269: ""We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves."" A must read for anyone to understand the deceptive, manipulative, and scrutinizing ways of those with authority. No one can tell you what you should think, otherwise they are trying to implement what they merely want you to think which enhances their control over your mind. The constant fear Winston has for the Thought Police, and his ultimate downfall makes this novel suspenseful and interesting until the very end."
1749,Todd,"Having not really heard much about this book before buying it, I wasn't really sure what to expect...I had no idea that such a small book could have such a huge impact on me and that I would still think about it long after having read it. It's hard for me to describe the book without giving too much of it away, but suffice to say that it is very well written and hard to put down. Even though it's set in a dystopian world, it didn't make me feel bad, just a little depressed. Make sure you read the appendices, they will set the story in a new light.One small annoyance, as I was close to finishing it I was watching some breakfast show and one of the presenters used 1984 as an example of something, spoiling the end for me. I was quite annoyed at the time but it was still a shock when I got to the end!"
1750,Priscilla,"Well, that was frightening.Initial thoughts1. Seriously. It was scary. IngSoc, Big Brother, newspeak, the Ministry of Love, the Minsitry of Truth, room 101. EVERYTHING. SCARY. AHHH.2. Thought provoking. Even though I was extremely disturbed by this dystopian world, I thought it was a powerful, insightful observation and commentary on our soceity.3. Didn't like or was particularly attached to the characters. However, I did empathize with Winston A LOT towards the end of the book.You can check out my video review here!"

1752,Célia,"1984 é um dos livros mais conhecidos do inglês George Orwell (pseudónimo de Eric Arthur Blair), a par de Animal Farm (""O Triunfo dos Porcos"" ou ""A Quinta dos Animais"", título de uma reedição recente da Antígona).O livro apresenta-nos um mundo dividido em 3 super-potências: Oceânia, Eurásia e Lestásia. O seu protagonista, Winston Smith, vive em Londres, que se encontra sob domínio da Oceânia. A sociedade caracteriza-se pela omnipresença do Estado, personalizada na figura do Grande Irmão (Big Brother), que controla a vida dos elementos do Partido ao mínimo detalhe, através dos telecrãs colocados por toda a parte. Winston Smith trabalha no Ministério da Verdade e a sua função é alterar os arquivos históricos para que o Partido tenha sempre razão. Para além da constante reformulação do passado, somos também confrontados com o surgimento da Novilíngua, que reformula ou elimina todas as palavras que impliquem o pensamento livre: a ideia era que se as palavras não existissem, o que elas representavam também desaparecia.O livro encontra-se dividido em 3 partes: na primeira, somos confrontados com a descrição da sociedade perfeitamente controlada pelo Partido e com o aparecimento das sementes da revolta em Winston; na segunda parte, somos confrontados com o fruto dessa rebeldia; na terceira e última parte, as consequências da mesma.A primeira palavra que me ocorre para descrever este livro é: assustador. Trata-se de uma espécie de metáfora para os regimes totalitários que dominavam o mundo em meados do século XX (em especial o estalinismo), mas leva a premissa muito mais além. O que pode à partida parecer uma sociedade inverosímil, transforma-se, pela pena de George Orwell, numa coisa absolutamente real. Apesar de termos consciência que estamos perante uma sociedade imaginada, a extrema habilidade do autor leva-nos, a cada momento, a temer a ideia aterradora que ela algum dia possa vir a existir. O livro pinta um retrato muito negativo da natureza humana, mas também revela a espaços a importância da liberdade e da opção de escolha. O seu final, apesar de inesperado (pelo menos para mim), está completamente de acordo com a visão do escritor e é, por isso, o final perfeito.O livro é extremamente bem escrito, numa linguagem clara, e nem as partes mais descritivas alguma vez se tornam maçadoras. O enredo e toda a imaginação necessária para o criar são exímios. Resumindo numa palavra: genial."
1753,Eidah,"well this novel is a extraordinary one Orwell comes very close to the red lines with his philosophy ,without touching any thing just he got his knife and cut off your heart I really got hurt by this one I like it and I guess I will read it more and more ...."

1755,881,"This book might start out a little bit slow/dry, and might seem uninteresting. But a couple of chapters in and you will get hooked! This book will make you question everything you ever believed and thought of your government, it will send chills down your spine. And towards the end, YOU WILL FEEL GOOSEBUMPS FROM THE TWIST OF EVENTS!... Scary stuff...The book (When basically stated) shows a totalitarian government at its worst. It teaches many lessons both philosophical and moral. It illustrates how the basic function of cognition or in other words, thinking, could be manipulated and distorted. The government uses wordings/ naming of things in a way to alter the perceptions of its citizens; for ex. 'Victory gin', 'Big Brother', 'Ministry of Love/ Peace/etc.' all these words bring a quasi feeling of prosperity, progress and superiority.Other methods used to control its citizens include: 1.Imaginary war or imaginary enemy (The Party bombs the proles and says its Eurasia = Proles look at the party as a protector, and remember 'desperate times call for desperate measures' is what the party uses as an excuse. )2. Erasing anything historical and killing the elderly, so the people won't have anything to compare their current society/ living standard to, thus not realizing they are living like shit..3. the government uses war as an excuse to make people work hard (Keep them busy= produce more) and instead of distributing the products made, using the military and war needing supply excuse the party manages to keep the inner party members living in luxury and everyone else.. not.. 4. The party takes away the pleasures of the citizens. ex. Sex is made into a disgusting thing= ppl don't have sex (unless want to have loveless brainwashed children who will snitch on their own parents) . and throughout the book you could see how men are always twitching which is b/c the are so suppressed etc. = have so much energy -> The party uses that energy to put the citizens (Not the proles) at work. 5. The party destroys language since language forms thought... the party wants to control people's thoughts.. Other methods are used such as constant surveillance and whatnot.. But what really gave me the chills were the convincing distortions of rational thought and how different perspectives (Don't want to spoil) although clearly are false, could be believable (if you were living in oceania.. if you were brainwashed by the party..).. The book has too many twists in it and deep thoughts, that I can't even start listing.. Reading this you will start questioning your own morals,""Is it okay to do bad for the greater good?"" ""Is it okay to do good for bad?"" ""confession is not betrayal?"" ""Would you kill to save a life?"" ""Would you demoralize to revive humanity?"" ...OKAY I'M GONNA STOP HERE.. JUST READ THE BOOK, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON MANY THINGS..."
1756,Michael Young,"Who Teaches You What You Mean? I am a poet and therefore obsess about language. How language is constructed and what those constructs mean and imply occupy a lot of my thinking. Because of this obsession, the novel 1984 strikes me as the greatest book written about the abuse of language. True, it is a novel about political power and oppression and is a warning of a kind to those of us who take a free society for granted. But the way that political power asserts itself is primarily through the power of language. The abuse of language in the novel comments inevitably on the right use of language and ultimately has something to say to the role of the poet in our world.1984 shows through a claustrophobic world of political oppression how the ability to articulate is controlled by the scope of our language, how we are always subject to the limitations of the language at our disposal. The whole point of Newspeak, the official language of the Party, is to reduce the available range of meaning and comprehension, to make it impossible for people to think something that is not approved by the doctrine of the Party. This language coupled with an endless rewriting of public records means both that it is impossible to know the truth about the past and that the individual is incapable of articulating the meaning of his individuality. Inevitably, the Party defines who and even what an individual is. In only the most limited sense does any individual exist in 1984 . To contradict the impulsive thought that this is merely science fiction, something futuristic and beyond reality, one only has to look at a poem by George Oppen in which he shows us that it is something we battle every day. In “Of Being Numerous,” a figure. . . wants to sayHis life is real,No one can say whyIt is not easy to speakA ferocious mumbling, in publicOf rootless speechOppen here distills the competition between language used as a means of the most profound existential realization and language used as a means for commercial manipulation. When we acquire our language, our expressions, our definitions from corporations and the commercials they make, then the language we have for expressing our deepest feelings or insights, our ideas about who we are or want to be, is shaped by them, at least to the extent that they – excuse the word – repurpose language to manipulate us for quite specific ends and in so doing, distance us from other associations. One of the primary ways the Party in 1984 controlled language was to diminish the number of associations related to any given word. This was attained by various methods. But this same diminishment is, in Oppen’s poem, what causes the man to be unable to find the words to express his inner being, the reality of his life. As I said in a previous essay about Oppen’s poem, “The man trying to speak the meaning of his life has no language to speak it. It is unreal because politics and public life have appropriated it for ends other than an existential dialogue.” This is precisely what the Party in 1984 does.Another of the methods for controlling thought through language is to reduce the number of words. The Party eliminated the word “bad.” They used, instead, “ungood.” This sounds farfetched but even today it isn’t uncommon to find an attitude of relying on a limited vocabulary for expression or assuming the superfluity of the abundant synonyms in English. However, in reality subtle denotative shades and deep connotations make words like “evil,” “miscreant” and “villainous,” though synonyms, all different from each other. Additionally, meaning is not merely semantic or intellectual, but is also emotional. The many associations and feelings a word or series of words evokes make even the closest synonyms still different from each other. Then consider there are many words in foreign languages that signify feelings and thoughts for which there are no English equivalents. What do we do with those thoughts and feelings? To assume they will be expressed in some way in the existing language is to make a dangerous assumption. In fact, I would guess that most of those feelings and thoughts go unarticulated, because it takes more than an act of will to find the right words to give them shape, it takes knowledge and the willingness to take risks, to sound foolish or even crazy. But if, as Jefferson said, “the price of freedom is eternal vigilance,” this holds true also for safeguarding language and ensuring that its growth and change is for the expansion of articulation, thought and meaning.Newspeak also attempts to reduce ambiguity. Here especially I see the playground of the poet because it is precisely at the edge of linguistic clarity that poets live and breathe. We have all had feelings we couldn’t put into words or thoughts that we just couldn't express. That’s because the range of human imagination and experience is greater than the range of our existing language and this is likely always to be so. That’s why there will always be poets and other artists trying to give shape and articulation to those very feelings and thoughts, those human experiences that haven’t come into the range of our history because we haven’t been able to document them in any way. That’s why poets are always toying with the obscure, not to be evasive or sound smart, but to get at something that’s just out of reach, to extend the light of articulation just a little farther into the darkness. This is the worthiest use of language and one that opposes other uses such as TV and magazine ads, billboards, the news media, and all other forms of mass production or corporate manipulation. It is not a self-righteous call to arms; it is simply the natural consequence of two opposing uses of language vying for control of a singular consciousness. "
1757,Malia Savella," The book 1984 follows a man by the name of Winston Smith in the particular year of (you guessed it) 1984. As the book was written before the year 1984, it is a dystopian novel from the standpoint of someone who could imagine a totalitarianism future. And that's what exactly what Winston lives: every action, word, and thought is more or less recorded by the government, with the reminder that BIG BROTHER(the heavily-worshiped leader of Oceania) IS WATCHING YOU. Winston is completely against the society he lives in. He fills his life with forbidden things, like an intimate partner named Julia, a private room over an antique shop, and a diary. He and Julia join a rebellion against the Party, only to find that they had been tricked and are then arrested. They then are individually tortured, psychologically and physically, into devotion to the Party (eg. consciously doublethinking, loving Big Brother, not loving one another). In the end, they die loyal to the Party, which was exactly what was wanted all along.This is a game- changing book. I have never read a story with the perspective that Orwell gave. It's commonly accepted to end a book with some sort of neutral or good moral, and it should be apparent now that that is not present here. It's almost backwards how the book is written: the way Winston under-develops as a human being is like a reverse character arc. What I find the most interesting is that this story is not about itself. This isn't a book about Winston's last year alive. Winston is merely a plot device used to magnify the world George Orwell had imagined. One could even claim that it is not a story, but rather a recollection of a moment, and the real story is what can be uncovered from the bits of information given. Orwell paints a fantastic setting (which I believe is the real story, if that couldn't already be assumed) that many books since have tried to mimic. Maybe the scariest part is the audience involvement, in the sense that the reader is able to see how aspects of the book are in our daily lives (NSA, anyone?). It is a perfect portrayal of different methods and sorts of power. I didn't realize how little I knew of the themes presented in this book until I had read it.If you are someone who enjoys dystopias about revolution, this is a really good contrast in terms of realism (as 1984 is pretty much the opposite of revolution). I'd say that anyone over the age of 12 would be able to grasp the concepts this book presents, and I really advise adults who are immersed in the ""real world"" to use this book to really shine a light on the one we live in now. This is a fantastic book that requires a lot of speculation, so be warned! It's worth it in the end. "
1758,Nirmal Patel,"A gem from George Orwell:I bought the book from my friend once i started it. From very beginning i know this going to be exciting. The book keeps you engaged or more than engaged through his various plots and characters and maintain it magnificently throughout . Winston smith , the protagonist is in search of the past tries to fight with his present in the fear of future. The dystopia created by George Orwell has created is haunting view of the world . WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY and IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH keep the whole story intact and nobody can escape from the eyes of Big Brother.This one should not be missed !!"

1761,Mariana,"""If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever"" George Orwell, 1984.1984 is a shattering and incredibly captivating novel.George Orwell personally speaks to my soul, his writing deeply resonates with me and I could not get enough of 1984. The writing is beautifully simplistic yet subtly embellished.The plot is rich and although the book is not as fast paced as modern dystopian novels, it did not fail to grab my attention. I absolutely love Orwell's writing, I found myself nodding in agreement while reading certain passages. I love the descriptions; the foreshadowing and symbolism is so cleverly done, the shattering of the paperweight is forever ingrained in my memory. I love the complexity of the concept of this book, and how it truly reflects Orwell's beliefs and thoughts about politics, I feel like I took away a lot of knowledge from reading this novel alongside some essays Orwell wrote that I am obsessed with. The characters were complex and vibrant, I felt that O'Brien was such a powerful and intense character. I also love the novel's narrative, while I was reading I felt that the omnipresent narrator was Orwell himself.This exceeded my expectations and I am so thrilled to read his other work.1984 is one of my favourite books of all time, (including Animal Farm by George Orwell too.), quotes and phrases are constantly reverberating in my ears. 1984 is a very powerful novel and I feel privileged to have read yet another brilliant work of art by Orwell, I most definitely recommend this book!"
1762,Christopher Matthewson,"""Freedom is Slavery. Two and Two make Five. God Is Power."" -still ringing in my ears...Well I can see what all the fuss was about. As much as I enjoyed it, I was taken aback at just how bleak it actually was; certainly much more so than I had anticipated.With three parts to the novel, all of which paced differently; come together in a way that is cohesive, and conducive to any plot as misanthropic as this. Although it's my first time reading a Dystopian novel, I can say with relative certainty that this is the standard by which all others are judged, There's a number of existentialist ideas, and philosophies to be be recognised from reading this most notably Solipsism and Marxism in Part 3, not to mention the imagery in Orwells pros that pretty effortlessly translates his purportedly innate sensibility to semiotics. It's no wonder Nietzsche caught on the way he did!Fantastic book. a must read in my opinion!"

1764,Ajay,"4.5 stars. Like an intricately crafted ticking clock, the cogs of this novel drew delightfully working order in disorder, edged beautifully to accommodate a supremely intellectually challenging, thought- provoking read. 1984, where Winston begins to question his place in the grand scheme of the world he knows, or to his knowledge he has been taught to know, he is controlled by pure, dictatorial, raw power. This future dystopia is something that is scary because it could be so real. A vision of world peace, love and utopia? Or the reality of a society based on farming the masses towards emotionless, mentally weak, blindingly- loyal abiding citizens of higher power authoritarian states discerning what you do, how you think and any actions you partake in; based on refraining you from any grasp on rebellion, impurity or ownership of any sort; which if even dreamt of, will result in indisputable death of your entire being through means of mental, physical and soul crushing torture in prisons, until guaranteed acknowledgement of your absolute inexistence, lack of free will of thinking and inexplicable ineptitude in governing any gram of control over anything in what little remains in your ultimately pitiful life, at all? Coincidentally, this book builds on thoughts I've had already, only displays it in a much more darker, cruel, distastefully wicked future. A truly mind- sculpting read. (Apologies if this made no sense, my brain is thinking too crazily at the minute.)"

1766,Ahmad Gamal,"Is it coincidental that I should be writing this review after the events of acquitting Mubarak and his associates of all charges? It probably is. 1984 is definitely a masterpiece, a book that every single person should or rather must read. It is a political encyclopedia for when it comes to how to establish a dictatorship, with even the most vivid details. What strikes and scares me most about this book is that the future Orwell has written about is already here; bit by bit it is turning into a reality. And As long as the people are unaware, as long as ignorance and illiteracy prevail, there will be no change.What I thought was most implemented in the real world was the symbolism of Big Brother. He is the face of the party, the face of the leadership. He might not even exist; it is the idea itself that is more powerful. The faces may change but what the face symbolizes and whatever ideology behind that face will never change. But there are other concepts and elements already implemented and manifested in many different countries of the world.I fully agree with Orwell that the world of 1984 might really begin to manifest some time in the near future but I really hope that at some point it will all change; I really hope that the ""proles"" will rise up against leadership. “If there is hope, it lies in the proles.” “The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently.""""Power is not a means; it is an end.""“One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship.”You have been warned."
1767,Mack,"If I were to meet George Orwell, I would probably give him a big, fat, wet, sloppy smooch on the cheek (and that's coming from a straight man!). Seriously though, 1984 was absolutely amazing! I have never read such a fascinating and authentic novel.1984 deals with a man named Winston who lives on Airstrip One of the continent of Oceania. Oceania encompasses the United Kingdom, North and South America, and all of the Atlantic Ocean (given its name). Oceania is at war with Eurasia. Eurasia is Europe, the Middle East, India, and part of Africa. Oceania’s ally is Eastasia. Eastasia is China, Russia, Eastern Asia, and the other part of Africa. Oceania is a dystopian society with a totalitarian government. Citizen’s every movements are heavily scrutinized by telesrceens, cameras and microphones. Their movements are not their own. The Party is what governs Oceania, with Big Brother at the head. Winston is a member of the Outer Party and works in the Ministry of Truth (or Minitru in Newspeak). Winston’s life is no different than any other citizen in Oceania, despite the fact that his memory is still intact. He can remember what is was like before the Party came to power. However, he comes to a shocking realization when a girl named Julia hands him a slip of paper that reads “I love you.” In addition, he comes into contact with a powerful member of the Inner Party named O’Brien who tells him “We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.” Winston comes to learn the true power of fear and ultimate betrayal in this gripping dystopian story.Are you ready for this? No, really, ARE YOU?? Get ready, because this book is practically dripping with symbolism, connotations and other literary nuggets.First off, 1984 was written in 1948. When Orwell was thinking up a title for this book, he simply switched the last two numbers of the current year. This novel was actually Orwell’s hypothesis of what the world would look like 40 years down the road. Although Orwell’s Oceania seems like a far-stretch from 2012 America, there are actually more similarities than you think. According to the novel, the Inner Party consists of 2% of Oceania’s population. The Outer Party consists of about 10%. The proles: 88%. According to recent statistics, the American elite consists of about 2% of the population, the middle-class occupying a rough 12%, and the lower-class filling in the remaining 86%. Dangerously close, eh? No, scary close is more like it!Now we move to the monitoring of Oceania’s citizens. How would you like to be under constant scrutinization and have your every move, thought, and sound recorded at every waking moment? It would be enough to drive you insane, wouldn’t it? The Party does this in order to keep a watch on each individual at all times and looks for undesirable actions. Thus appeared the immensely popular tagline: BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU. Having someone watching you at all times would cause paranoia and insanity. In effect, it would strip you of your humanity and reduce you to nothing more than a hollow shell doing what the government orders you to. In a sense, your life and movements would not be your own. Rather, you belong to the Party. This reminds me of the widespread Fascism that started in Nazi Germany in 1939. Fascism is strong devotion to one’s country and placing everything (including family, business, and education) second. Germany embraced Fascism and proclaimed, “You were born to die for Germany!” That is pretty much what the Party has instilled. You are not a person, you are the Party. You may think to yourself, “How crazy! Our government would never monitor me without my permission!” Big Brother is indeed watching you. Many companies and organizations have special branches of security that monitor employees’ e-mail, internet usage and phone conversations. Plus, many of today’s cell phones are embedded with a chip that is monitored by satellite and can be pinpointed. How would you like to know that someone could hack into your iPhone and be able to see through your front-facing camera without you knowing it?Almost always, those who set out to create a utopia usually end up creating a dystopia. Oceania is a dystopia. There is no society, there is only the Party. The Party has attempted to destroy individuality and humanity by erasing all traces of the past and controlling the future. The party plays on the present, claiming that there is no past. The Ministry of Truth, where Winston works, is dedicated to finding imperfections in newspapers, magazines, books, and other written materials and correcting them. This is the Party’s attempt to be perfect and prophetic in the citizens’ eyes. Such an appearance allows for the masses to trust them and embrace them, so that they may ultimately control them. Also, there is the new language known as Newspeak. Newspeak is meant to replace Oldspeak (or modern English). Newspeak’s aim is dramatically cut down word usage, effectively limiting our range of language and eliminates personality. For example, Newspeak dictates that since the word good exists, there is no need for the word bad. To resolve this issue, they simply place the prefix un- in front of good, resulting in ungood. Newspeak brought forth the cornerstone of Oceanian society: doublethink. Doublethink allows a person to forgo logic and is able to understand paradoxes. The three slogans of the Party are: WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, and IGNORANCE IS POWER. Let’s look at these for a moment.WAR IS PEACE: Clearly a paradox. However, you don’t need doublethink to understand the Party’s reasoning behind such a statement. Under what circumstance do a people truly become united? When they face a common enemy. By Oceania going to war, the citizens become caught up in wartime frenzy. According to Goldstein’s book, there is an underlying curriculum: consumption of goods. During war, certain numbers of supplies must be shipped to the warfront. By engaging in war, the Party is able to eliminate any surplus of goods. Without a surplus amount of goods, the Party is able to create three distinct classes: the High, the Middle, and the Low. This class distinction helps keep the status quo. Think about it; whenever there is a surplus of goods, more goods become available to everyone. When everyone has access to the same thing, in a sense, everyone becomes equal. When everyone is equal, senses of individuality become apparent. This is fatal to the Party, so they must “go to war” to eliminate that possibility and keep the “peace.”FREEDOM IS SLAVERY: Another paradox. When you are free, you are able to choose for yourself and do whatever you want. Of course, such freedom enables you to pursue good ends, or bad ends. With freedom, there is no one to tell you not to job off that bridge or not to eat those poisonous foods. The Party uses this view to “enslave” the citizens of Oceania, playing that they will act as a “Big Brother” to the people and protect them from any harm. Only be becoming a slave can you ensure your safety.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH: I love this paradox. I don’t think it’s good, but its good brain food. When I see this, I think of the Middle East or Communist Russia. Both governments attempt to stupefy the masses keeping them illiterate and uneducated. The goal: make the people so ignorant and passive that they won’t realize right from wrong. With the people ignorant of the government’s transgressions, they are free to gain all the power they want and commit every abomination they want. This is evident in the Middle East. Many countries there are forced to live under strict dictatorships because they aren’t smart enough to think for themselves. They simply adapt to their surroundings and conform to survive. Such is the Party’s cornerstone to power.This novel is one of those novels that just keeps you thinking. My copy is full of notes and connotations that its value has most certainly decline. Throughout the whole novel, I kept seeing visions of Communist Russia, the Middle East, and even America. Big Brother’s mustachioed face brings images of Joseph Stalin! The limiting of humanity and elimination of history are both equally horrifying and interesting. Although Orwell’s vision of 1984 is vastly different then the real 1984, it could simply be a late vision of the near future. If you have kept up with recent records and events, our society is certainly headed down a road toward a place that could very well resemble Oceania. In a way, 1984 serves as a warning that if we don’t get ourselves into shape, we might just fall under the Party’s spell and fall in love with “Big Brother.”"
1768,Diablo,"1984 has some very interesting depth and width to its pages. There were many chapters to which I had to read and reread to comprehend the politics, concepts and philosophy of the book. Yes, we can say this is yet another book on English Socialism run by an oligarchical dictatorship, but in this case it causes me to wonder to what point man gives up his freedoms, his will to the “greater good” of the State or Society. And as the Fox to the Crow – at what point do we finally realize that we no longer can fly because we have given our primary feathers to the Fox?1984 is an extreme version of Socialism, but gives me pause to evaluate our own society and those of other countries and compare and make judgment over the wealth-happiness-growth and well-being of the individual/State. There cannot be any right answer as each culture and individual is different in every way – yet arguably power is held among the select few in each country and how it is administered, whether by force or by the voice of the people.The questions that each individual needs to ask oneself is this, “Where is the balance of my freedom and happiness given to the laws of those that govern me?” and “How much of that power ought I give to my rulers?” No matter what civilization, the governed do have a choice of being ruled or governed simply by the masses of election or by revolution. Failure to do one or the other is simply an acceptance of that government.1984 is a great book to ponder on where one stands on his own freedoms and values."

1770,Marjorie Viola,"this is brilliant and im speechless!i wasnt imagining to like 1984 better than animal farm but WOW this book is absolutely amazing! the society's description he does fits so so well back in 1949, when the book was first released, and now in 2k15 and that fact alone shocks me.and even with his ups and downs, i liked Winston in general.but the genius work comes with g. orwell's criticism of totalitarianism governments and how they control us. i thought the new language he created was the perfect way to demonstrate that control.the thing that actually surprised me the most is that his writting style on this book is so easy to read and understand that you can forget about anything else while reading.im thinking about doing a proper review on this because i simply cannot express my feelings without spoilers loli ultra super highly recommend 1984 for everyone that loves history, and political stuff and for those who doesn't at all because this book is just every good thing you can imagine in the world."

1773,renee g,"I don't recall exactly when I first read 1984, but i was very young, and now that I've reread it, i realize that the impact it made on me then is nothing to now. Our brains work differently when we age, and we interpret things differently. As a young person, it was a dystopian fantasy, something that made me aware of how a future like this could become real, but not really. The totalitarian ignorance was inconceivable. Now, with a better understanding of human behaviour and motives, it's chilling how very easily our society could actually allow itself to be run this way. It doesn't happen overnight, its the little steps we take every year that remove our freedom, our responsibility, and our drive to be better. I'm now in the mood to reread Ayn Rand....."
1774,N,"Many people will say that it's an anti comunist novel. In fact, Orwell was an anti comunist. But I think that 1984, besides the clear reference to socialism, takes concern about the human being loosing his humanity. It's not even far to ""democracies"", like USA. By the way, USA government totally looks like Big Brother, and that's not a brand new criticism. I should recommend 1984 for everyone who have an open mind to absorb the socialism references and make your own judgment about humanity in the book and nowadays; great book for great minds. Otherwise, if you just like to hunt comunists, if you are that stupid people who claims against all social politics or say that capitalism is the best ever choice, well... Just look another rage book, because 1984 is more than a comunism hunt. It's a shame for literature that this kind of people use 1984 to be your political argument."
1775,Priyanshu Mani,"This book made me pay attention to the intricacies of language. With a new tongue- Newspeak, the whole thought process could have been affected. As a reflection of the society, this book is very realistic. It is of course a depressing world (the imaginary world of 1984) and I was enjoying it when Winston was breaking the rules. The new kind of Politics in India, with every party having its propaganda machinery (photoshopping images and tweeting), the media sometimes twisting, sometimes blowing things out of proportion, makes this book strangely relevant. They all seem to be a part of the Ministry of Truth. It is a mercy that we have so many groups and parties in India that they balance each other out (more or less), but this book nevertheless makes one cautious as a citizen.I would recommend this to anyone who is passionate about our democracy, to politicians and smart citizens alike."
1776,Tanni,"I don't know if this is considered a ""classic"" or not, but it's definitely one of those ""books teachers make you read in school."" Because of that, I went into this somewhat reluctantly. It's a book I've always wanted to read, mostly because I just felt obligated to read, but I didn't think I'd really enjoy it. I was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable it actually was. Maybe ""enjoyable"" is the wrong word. I mean, let's be honest: this is a pretty depressing, almost horrifying book. If you want something uplifting, don't read 1984, because you're probably going to walk away from it feeling pretty awful. But it was much easier to read and get absorbed in than I had expected. The characters are a bit bland, but I thought that actually fit very well considering the setting. The plot had little twists and turns that kept things interesting, but I think what really drew me in was just how thought-provoking this book is. The world George Orwell has created definitely resonates with some of the things we see in our world today, and even though the year 1984 has come and gone, I think this is a book that will remain relevant for decades to come."
1777,Hassan,"Being a student of liberal arts, I had heard a lot about this novel and how it unmasks the workings of a totalitarian state. During the last few decades or so, we have seen the rise and demise of totalitarian and security states such as that of Soviet Union and then those totalitarian policies being implemented in the form of Patriot act and NSA in the United States of America after 9/11. So for me, a novel that was based on a dystopia found real relevance in the world that we are living in.There were many point of contentions ii this novel, all of which were brilliantly portrayed. The one that attracted me the most was the whole idea of 'double speak' ; believing in two contradictions at the same time. As the manifesto of The Party went in the novel, 'War is Peace Freedom is Slavery Ignorance is Strength'The novel revolved around those aphorisms and after a point, finding the relevance of those aphorisms in our daily lives as a global citizen became sort of scary. So from the perspective of a totalitarian state, why war was peace? If we keep in mind the fact that George Orwell was a well known Marxist, then the explanation of that idea by the author makes a lot of sense. The surplus that is produced in any economy can be used to uplift the life standards of the proletarians or proles, as it is conveniently used by the author. But doing so would raise their intellectual ability and they would no longer accept the dictatorship of 'The Party' or the nobility who are very few. They'll bring about a revolution which will bring chaos in a system that is so carefully and mercilessly being ordained by the party. So it is important to keep them busy and the best way to keep them busy is in war. War includes no construction so the surplus is not produced, rather destroyed. The same surplus that can be used to better the lives of those proles that make up 85 percent of the population. But that would of course, undermine the strength and power of the state. We find a chilling resemblance of that narrative with that of the military industrial complex of the United States of America which has spent trillions of dollars in the war against terror, half of half of which could have been sufficient to eradicate poverty from the entire world. So the utopia of a state fueled by the war as portrayed by George Orwell is materialized in today's world as the United States of America. The next notion, 'Freedom is slavery' indicates the idea that you can only be free if you are a slave to the state. Your state can use surveillance on each and every action of yours, restrict your movement and censor whatever it deems fit so that you can be free. The protagonist rebels against this notion by finding places where he can't be seen such as the room above the antique shop and the clearing in the forest. He rebels against this idea of lack of privacy. There is a certain kinship that exists between that protagonist and the people who denounced NSA when they found out about their illegal surveillance over the lives of other people. And of course, with Edward Snowden. The last tenet of the party manifested in multiple ways. The whole idea of double think, of believing in contradictions is the whole basis of the strength of that state. The ministries of love, peace and plenty were in fact the edifices of torture, war and scarcity. But a citizen had to believe in them or what the state told about them. If not, there always was a thought police that rounded up those heretics who denounced those institutions, even in their sub-conscious and they were then brain-washed before they were killed or released in the society. Another ignorance that the state used to propagate its influence over the minds of the people, especially children was its monopoly and the ability to change the past in text books. Children were taught to adore the big brother and the party and denounce the enemy with complete hatred. The same was accomplished by hate week. In my view, this was a brilliant critic on how nation states use jingoism and denouncing their enemies to create a negative identity. An identity that is based on who we are against and then the force of that identity is used to justify heavy military budget and bills such as patriot act. Another idea that I absolutely loved in this novel was the importance of knowing the authentic past. We all need to know the historical context in which our lives exist. We need to know the past in order to know the present. Unfortunately, the modern states mold the past, with the underlying idea that 'He who controls the present, controls the past' and then that narrative is taught in public institutions. We have to see life in a continuum of thousands of years, before and after, in order to play a part in its authentic evolution. As Goethe said, 'He who cannot draw on three thousand yearsIs living from hand to mouth'"
1778,Catherine Alice,"If you enjoyed reading this book, I would not recommend watching the film! It does not do the darkness of Orwell's creation justice at all.I felt tense, worried and fearful throughout this book. I thought it was absolutely brilliant.Winston is a strong, but down-trodden character whose spark is reignited through Julia. The society in which these characters live in is so oppressive and terrifyingly realistic, and the human emotion 'love' attempts to challenge this. This story leaves you with questions long after you have finished reading it. Orwell is so clever, in his creation of such an extreme society he leaves nothing out.It is exceptionally difficult to review 1984 as I still find it disturbing months on. However I would recommend it to anyone, just so that I can talk about!"
1779,Ola,"This past summer I fell in love with two men: Bob Dylan and George Orwell. This is why I fell in love with the latter.It's been awhile, so I can't give a sufficient review on 1984. Maybe I will when I reread it...but just know that 1984 is beyond amazing, and you might have the incredible urge to dig up Orwell's grave and hug him after you finish it.Or is it just me?"
1780,Harrison Freed,"George Orwell applied the past to the present in Animal Farm, and then four years later he applied it to the future in the subject of this review, 1984. Both were heavily inspired by the Bolshevik revolution, but they differ in a few ways: Animal Farm is a “fairy story;” it uses talking animals. It, truth be told, is not a very interesting read when considered independently from said revolution. Here’s plot summary of it, without stopping to consider the revolution: “Animals don’t like their owner so they talk about him and then they overthrow him and then they are corrupted and it was just 200 pages of animals doing oddly specific things.” The point I am making is that the book most easily compared with 1984 hardly stands as a book. Without researching, Animal Farm could just an odd experience. Its plot is too directly a mirror of the soviets. 1984 explores more themes, completes the allegory just as well, and most importantly, stands as a book.I read this book after reading Animal Farm and Fahrenheit 451, and read it because of purported similarities (as well recommendations), and I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the plot; I enjoyed the characters; I enjoyed the intricate language; I enjoyed them because they were fantastic. Somehow, though, they aren’t what’s most important in this book. I could write an essay simply on the thoughts raised by this book without mentioning the main character, Winston Smith, or any of the other characters; I could write about this book without mentioning that the language is beautiful (a citizen who succumbed to the propaganda of the government praises his country, to which Winston decides that “It was not the man’s brain that was speaking; it was his larynx.” pg. 54); I could explain it without delving into the plot; I could skim over so much and still have so much to say, because Orwell leaves so much to think about.If you don’t know the gist of the book, (then where have you been?) it can be explained rather simply: a man named Winston lives in dystopian 1984 on an island called Airstrip One (renamed Great Britain) in a country called Oceania that produces endless propaganda, war, and famine. 2% of the population are higher-ups in the government, 13% are lower down (Winston), and 85% are just about nowhere, starving and considered animals. Winston works for the Ministry of Truth, which deals in lies. When the government makes up a person to die a war hero in the interest of gaining loyalty, it Winston’s job to go through records and creates evidence of them having existed. When two fake stories disagree with each other, Winston changes lies to reality so that the English Socialist or Ingsoc system doesn’t appear flawed.Winston knows what he’s doing is wrong. Some of his co-workers who do the same job believe that they’re writing the truth and righting the wrongs, but he isn't fooled. He only does as he’s told. If he is told 2+2=5, no matter how blatant a lie that is, he must either preach it or be called a thoughtcriminal. He hates the government, as do a few others, though they've never shared that info with each other: disliking the government, if it is suspected of someone, means death, so confiding in anyone that he dislikes Ingsoc is practically asking for it. Big Brother (the icon supposed to be the leader of Ingsoc) is Stalin, he’s Napoleon the pig, he’s a concept, he may be real, he may be fiction.So much goes on in 1984. I love it as a book; I love it as a warning. I recommend this book because of a fantastic story, fantastic writing style, fantastic supporting characters, and because of how relevant it is today. People describe the NSA as “Orwellian.” Read 1984 to find out why. I leave you with a quote:
""Comrade Ogilvy, who had never existed in the present, now existed in the past, and when once the act of forgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon the same evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar."" pg. 50
"
1781,Yvette Thomas-mccune,"After reference after reference to this book I finally broke down and read it. It was exactly what I expected. Not much in the way of character development, but that was not what this book was about. Everything you've heard is true. It's more a prophesy/warning than the great American Novel. So stop buying smart televisions and for the love of Christ, turn off the news, especially Fox. "
1782,Dina,تحياتي الى جورج أورويل فكم هو رائع في وصفه للثورة والسلطة الحاكمة وكم تتشابه العصور على مر الزمان ومن أحسن ما عرض في الرواية الحوار الذي كان بين أوبراين و ونستون عندما قال ( إن السلطة ليست وسيلة بل غاية، فالمرء لا يقيم حكماً استبدادياً لحماية الثورة، إنما يشعل الثورة لإقامة حكم استبدادي ) عندما تقرأ هذه الرواية تدرك المعنى الحقيقي ( لعملية غسيل المخ )
1783,Engi Amin,Deep. Intense. Daunting. Part 3 is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. I caught myself panting at some point and had to pause to take in the shocking intensity of the dialogue. I have officially lost faith in humanity.
1784,Winston,"1984 takes the idea of an arbitrarily repressive government to its ultimate form, and has the most uncompromising, bleak, depressing view of a possible future ever written. 1984 boils down the principles of totalitarianism to information control. ""Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.""The Ministry of Truth has rewritten history and restricted even the English language, working to eliminate each word which could allow the expression of thoughts of rebellion or freedom. Even those in power have mastered the use of double-think to allow the simultaneous cynical manipulation of others, and unquestioning belief in the principles of EngSoc.The physical methods of control are not subtle. All members of the party are subjected to constant surveillance, and those who commit even small thought crimes are physically and mentally tortured until they love big brother in the Ministry of Love and are put to death. Perpetual, contrived war with the other two empires keeps the population in a whipped up frenzy of hate and patriotism, and excuses the persistent and arbitrary rationing and poverty.Orwell has an incredible grasp of history and the methods used to repress and control populations. The positive influence of this book on the perception and practice of politics in the 20th Century can probably not be overstated, and even though the 20th Century dodged that bullet, this future is still possible, especially with the kinds of technology available today for surveillance and oppression."
1785,Fernando Delfim,"""Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past"""
1786,Dini,"You need to be in the right mind to read this book. When I first tried to read it my head started swirling and I had to switch to a lighter book, but I came back to it later and was rewarded for my perseverance. 1984 deserves the legendary status it has. My favorite part is excerpts from Emmanuel Goldstein's book, which, although only describes the world of the story more systematically and in more detail, is awesome nonetheless. What is more awesome is the concept of 'doublethink', which means altering your mind to believe in something that is not true, while at the same time believing that the thing is true all along and has never been altered. But when deemed necessary, you can summon the altered memory and revert it to its natural state or alter it again to suit the desired purpose. Three words from me: WTF?"
1787,Ahmed Salama,من الاخر روايات جورج اوريل من الحاجات اللي لازم تقراها زي ما بتقري كتب المدرسة الاساسية لو مقرتهاش يببقي فاتك كتير جدا رواية عميقة .. شيقة .. فيها مجهود فكري غير عادي دور عليها و اشتريها بس كدة :D 
1788,E. Chainey (Bookowski),"SİSTEM...Bir sistem vardır hani bazen dışına çıktığınızı zannedersiniz düşüncelerinizle, duygularınızla, soyut varlığınızla. İşte bu bir sanrıdır aslında. Siz onun dışına çıkamazsınız. Baskıcı bir toplumda birileri sürekli sizi izlerken bile bile lades der, sonra da onların istediği kıvama mecburen getirilirsiniz. İşte bu kitapta da bu var. Ürperten bir distopya, size çok yakın ama bir o kadar uzak sandığınız bir sistem, yukarıdakiler (bir insanlar topluluğu değil yıkılmaz bir ideoloji) -aşağıdakiler (proleterler, aptallar, bir şey yapamayacak olan insancıklar) ayrışması, korku imparatorluğu. Çok uzatıp da büyüsünü bozmak istemiyorum kitabın. Kitabı sindirerek, ağır ağır birkaç kere okumak gerek, hatta gerektiğinde notlar almak. Bu benim ilkimdi. Daha nice kereler okumak üzere belleğimin en nadide yerlerinden birine alındı..."
1789,TheBigGSN5,"One of my favorite things about the book is that the interesting plot, setting and characters are all a kind of excuse to get people to read The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism, in which Orwell lays out the sad truth that humans have it within their power to use science and technology to give everyone a decent life, but largely fail to do so. He also throws in a clear explanation of the endless social class cycle, just as a nice bonus.I think Orwell may have been somewhat irritated, had he lived, at how much attention has been payed to the aspects of the fictional totalitarian regime instead of his analysis of the ongoing reality of waste and evil. Or perhaps not, as he foresaw the reaction to his words:'The programme it sets forth is nonsense. The secretaccumulation of knowledge--a gradual spread of enlightenment--ultimatelya proletarian rebellion--the overthrow of the Party. You foresaw yourselfthat that was what it would say. It is all nonsense. The proletarians willnever revolt, not in a thousand years or a million. They cannot. I donot have to tell you the reason: you know it already. If you have evercherished any dreams of violent insurrection, you must abandon them. Thereis no way in which the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party isforever. Make that the starting-point of your thoughts.' "
1790,Shaden Abu Al-Haijaa,A must read!
1791,Shannon,Cannot believe it took me so long to pick up this book.Totally enthralling from start to finish.
1792,Cynthia,Mind blown. It was great to ready this immediately after having read Animal Farm. The two books compliment each other and made my experience very enjoyable. Incredibly relevant to my views on present society and government. Timeless piece of literature. 
1793,Irs,"No solo le dejo la máxima puntuación, sino que además lo consideraré a partir de ahora uno de mis favoritos. No tengo nada que criticarle, lo único: debería especificarse con claridad que también pertenece al género de terror, además de ciencia ficción, porque eso es lo que logra transmitir en cada pasaje de un modo brillante y sorprendentemente real."
1794,Brian Leach,"I decided to re-read this book after first reading it in high school forever ago. I'm glad it did. I see so many parallels between this book and modern society that it's scary. Rule through fear, ostracize the nonconformist...sound familiar?"
1795,Tim,"Orwell's 1984 is an important novel not so much because it is a brilliant and terrifying story, but because in visualising that dystopian future so vividly, Orwell gave us a language to deny it. Neologisms like ""big brother"", ""thoughtcrime"" and ""doublethink"" have entered our vocabulary, and allow us to properly describe government and popular actions that threaten to take us down the road to 1984. It's proof that when an idea is given a human narrative, it gains an immense power to transform."
1796,Tanya,"Este, cu siguranță, una dintre cele mai bune cărți citite de mine. Deși are o singură linie de subiect, cartea mi s-a părut complexă, tocmai de asta ar fi indicat să o recitesc. Îmi plac cărțile care mă scot din lumea mea și-mi cer o atenție maximă ca să le înțeleg. Or, asta mi s-a întâmplat cu 1984. Dublugândit, bungânditor, crimăstop. Iubirea, ura, munca...toate sunt venite dintr-un efort supraomenesc, într-o lume infernală. Cartea asta e despre multe: despre libertate care e sclavie, despre războiul care e pace, despre ignoranța care e putere și despre iubirea care e ură. Ați citit-o? Dacă nu, ar fi bine să vă apucați imediat de ea, pentru că, știți voi, Fratele cel Mare e cu ochii pe voi."

1798,Abhigyan Siddhant,"This one is a personal favourite. The dystopian society portrayed in this book has more significance than just being a story. This is, while being a political in nature, the greatest horror story ever written, due to the simple fact that elements of the fictional society described in the books are reflected in real life. Throughout history, there have been examples that have illuminated the sheer brilliance of the book; be it the USSR under Stalin, or the current North Korean regime: they all show the quintessential characteristics of dystopia that Orwell foresaw in his writing. Nineteen Eighty-Four is a modern classic literature, whose impact on the life and politics has arguably been the greatest. With introduction of many concepts into real life, such as doublespeak and thoughtcrime, the novel has defined the modern political thinking, creating what is called an Orwellian viewpoint. This is truly one of the books that can alter ones viewpoint on world and world politics. "
1799,Henry Manampiring,"the ending of the book still sends shivers to me, when even the absolute truth can be distorted with enough torture and oppression. We may not have experienced '1984' in 1984, but it does not mean it may not happen in the future.Freedom of thought must be continuously defended!"
1800,Miguelitor,"Grande, como un sistema totalitario nos vigila, nos obliga, nos hace sus esclavos, nos tiene calladitos….cuanto vale el poder????, Grande Orwell 1984 sitúa su acción en un Estado totalitario. Como explica O'Brien, el astuto y misterioso miembro de la dirección del partido dominante, el poder es el valor absoluto y único: para conquistarlo no hay nada en el mundo que no deba ser sacrificado y, una vez alcanzado, nada queda de importante en la vida a no ser la voluntad de conservarlo a cualquier precio. La vigilancia despiadada de este Superestado ha llegado a apoderarse de la vida y la conciencia de sus súbditos, interviniendo incluso y sobre todo en las esferas más íntimas de los sentimientos humanos. Todo está controlado por la sombría y omnipresente figura del Gran Hermano, el jefe que todo lo ve, todo lo escucha y todo lo dispone. Winston Smith, el protagonista, aparece inicialmente como símbolo de la rebelión contra este poder monstruoso, pero conforme el relato avanza queda cada vez más atrapado por este engranaje, omnipresente y cruel. Un magnífico análisis del poder. Una de las novelas más inquietantes y atractivas del siglo XX"
1801,eliana,???????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1802,Chris Thompson,"These days the popular dystopias are written for teenagers. With the exception of Cormac McCarthy's The Road, the dystopias getting the most attention (and movie deals) are the likes of The Hunger Games and Divergent. These teen stories tend to focus much more on romance issues than they do on the larger social issues. Not that romance is irrelevant in a dystopia, but what should make it compelling is how such a romance is affected, or made dangerous by, the oppressive society the people live in. The Hunger Games only takes a shallow look at this, with poor Katniss moping over whether she should show more affection to Gale or Peeta. Despite being over 60 years old, George Orwell's 1984 manages to top the teen dystopias both in terms of social criticism and romance. It offers plenty of lessons not only for modern authors jumping into the genre, but also to modern society, as technology has advanced to the point of making Orwell's warnings come true.Where Suzanne Collins chooses her heroine, Katniss Everdeen, to have extraordinary athletic ability and Legolas-like skills with a bow and arrow, George Orwell provides his hero, Winston Smith, with varicose ulcers in his ankle. Winston has spent his adult life as a member of the Outer Party in London, in the nation of Oceania, which consists of the Americas and Britain. Under the watching eyes of Big Brother, Winston, like the rest of the party members, lives under constant fear that he will be accused of harboring thoughts against Big Brother. Telescreens keep an eye on citizens even in the comfort of their own homes. Thought Police detect rebellious thoughts by reading facial expressions. People often disappear without warning. Those who remain are left in terror.Language itself has even undergone serious changes. This language is called Newspeak. Its purpose is to make speech more efficient by cutting out unnecessary words. Why have ten ways to say something is good when one will suffice? If you think your food is excellent, you would say it is plusgood or doubleplusgood. The purpose is to prevent thoughtcrime by eradicating the vocabulary required to think against the party. As one of the party mottoes goes, ""Ignorance is Strength:"" it is better that citizens are stupid in order that Big Brother stay in power. And as our government continues to make cuts to education spending, one must wonder whether some of our politicians haven't adopted this motto for themselvesWinston, as is required of heroes in the genre, despises the oppressive system he lives under. Nonetheless, he sees no choice but to continue to act as a tool of Big Brother in order to stay alive. He works in the Ministry of Truth, where, instead of truth, lies are told. And, ironically, Winston enjoys his work. He rewrites history to always make Big Brother look good. If Big Brother had made a prediction that turned out to be inaccurate, it's Winston's job to rewrite old articles so Big Brother was actually right. The ability to control history is a powerful one. One can turn the tide of opinion for or against a person by erasing a mistake or creating a narrative of horror. History, really, is only what is written and what is passed down, not what really happened. Nobody can go back and prove what really happened because the past no longer exists. It can easily be changed if everyone is convinced of an alternate version. Even in our internet era of surplus information, truth and fiction can easily become mixed up.The novel's first third sets up much of the background on the society. It establishes characters, none of whom Winston is very close to. It's dangerous to be close friends with somebody because that person could just as easily turn you in. However, the novel turns to romance after the initial introductions, exciting romance because it is dangerous. It is also an adult romance. Winston and his love interest are physically attracted to one another, and they do more than just make out. Sex for pleasure is an act of rebellion in a world where scientists are working to abolish the orgasm. The portrayals of attraction in The Hunger Games are less realistic because they remove the element of sex. In its PG-13 world, the kiss is the major payoff. Humans have a biological need to act out on sexual urges, and in times of oppression that urge can become stronger because it is repressed.While 1984 is certainly more for adults than The Hunger Games, it is, nonetheless, still widely taught in high schools. Part of me wonders whether its inclusion in the curriculum is due to a continuing influence of anti-communist thought from the Cold War era. It has some important ideas to consider, to be sure, and is very imaginative and frightening, but at the same time it's not particularly great writing. Orwell spends large chunks of time wading through dull ideology, much of it anti-communist, particularly as we read the sections from the book of Emanuel Goldstein, the leader of the rebellion against Big Brother. If Orwell had reduced or removed a lot of these passages, the book would be vastly improved. I'm also concerned by the way the book is taught in schools. It seems less importance is placed on the ideas in the book and more on minute details. When a test question asks how old Winston and Julia are, our literature education is sadly missing the mark.1984 truly stands out in its feeling of hopelessness. In this world created by atomic destruction, power was taken by those who most wanted to hold onto it, at any cost. There's a sense that this lone man, Winston, can do nothing against such a power as Big Brother and the Thought Police. The reader has hope, to be sure, that he can. There's a belief that he can. Our culture perceives that the hero always wins. In movies, in books, in video games, the good guy wins the day, no matter how grim the situation. That's why 1984 is so terrifying. The best hero it can come up with is a man with varicose ulcers in his vein. As it begins to hurtle towards its conclusion the terror grows greater. While I do have some misgivings about the book in some ways, I can't help but admire the way Orwell mercilessly crushes our hopes. If society does go the way of 1984 (a big ""if,"" admittedly), there's no guarantee somebody will be able rise up and do the right thing. That's what's frightening. The heroism of the individual is merely a myth. "
1803,Dina Abdallah,1984 رواية فيها إبداع في تخيل حالة استبداد وديكتاتورية ولا إنسانية لأقصى الحدود لم أتوقع أن العقل البشري يمكن أن يوصل لتخيله لطرق للإستعمار والتحكم بحياة الناس لهذه الدرجة رواية كئيبة أعتقد أن الدولة التي افترضها جوروج أورويل تتصف ببعض ملامح دولتنا العزيزة وهو ما زاد الرواية كآبة وحزن نهايتها أثرت فيا بشكل كبير إزاي ممكن تحويل الشخص وأفكاره للدرجة دي إزاي يمكن سحب روحه للدرجة دي إزاي ممكن الحكر على المشاعر والأفكار بالطريقة الوحشية دي وأنا مستمرة في قرأتها جت في دماغي أفكار مشابهة لأفكاره بس تجاه مصر غالبها أفكار عدوانية جدا للبلد اللي بتسير بخطى ثابتة وواثقة للمصير ده يارب 
1804,Thurston,"Am I reading a newspaper or novel from the 40's???Wow - I was blown away, exhausted, depressed after reading this.I have heard of many orwellian topics from the book but have never read it. Did not know what to expect and I was surprised with the ending.I noted 80 percent of the pages i could draw direct parallelism to what is happening today.Stage 1 complete...Lack of critical thought in place.Edit(anyone regardless of political affiliation thinks free thought is not be censored in america, needs to watch the totalitarian expose by Jon Stossel that just aired tonight )http://watchdog.org/242019/john-doe-f...I suppose if there is one fault, it could have been longer.https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/phot..."
1805,Eva Johnson,"Chilling and, strangely, still very relavent."
1806,James Volland,"1984 is the most terrifying book that I have ever read, and perhaps the best and most thought provoking novel I will read in my life.I didn’t know what to expect, and I certainly did not know how to approach the book. Should I set my mind as if I was reading the book in 1949 looking into the future, or should I set my mind in the present day looking back to a man writing a book in 1949 about the future. To a certain existent I needn’t have bothered, as it was clear that despite the title “1984” it was not important what year it was, as this was a nightmare not a year; a nightmare which succeeded in its function to terrify me.In 1949 World War 2 had just left its ugly mark on the world, and the cold war had two nuclear superpowers on edge. This undoubtedly led George Orwell to his nightmarish vision of the future, less so a foreseeing more a warning. The scenario is so well thought out by Orwell, that you are in this nightmare together with the main character ‘Winston Smith’, and it’s hard not to actually put yourself in the actual shoes of Winston. It is that that makes the story a nightmare, especially the ending. You want Winston to succeed, you want the story to progress with the ultimate downfall of big brother but…… no spoilers; I hate reviews with spoilers.I both love and hate this book, which is hard to explain as I rate this book 10/10 and would recommend it to all; doublethink indeed.10/10JV"
1807,Habjouqa,"Well what I am about to write is not really a review, I don't know what can it be called.I am just disappointed by how the book ended, maybe it is realistic or maybe not.I imagined that Winston would eventually show any sign that he is still sane (2+2=4), I thought that the book would end by Winston solving the chess challenge with the black rocks winning and thus challenging the authority and control of the party.I refuse to believe that an individual will throw away his sanity, I strongly believe that any individual is willing to pay the highest price whatever it was in order to defend his freedom, sanity and principals....If I were is Winston's place, I have two options;1) Insist on 2+2=4, even if it kills me, I will allow the rats to eat me alive, I will keep on arguing. Life is worthless, life is not worth losing your sanity or losing your freedom.2) Act stupid, behave stupid, obey, and then break free and try to conspire against the party all over again.I am not currently being tortured and accordingly I am not sure if those two options are realistic in Winston's case.I feel like I am William Wallace, but this is genuinely how I feel."
1808,Faith,Utterly mind numbing. I will reference this book for the rest of my life
1809,Davejohncole,Amazing. Just amazing. This book has stuck with me since the day I first picked it up. 
1810,Chelsea,"Amazing that this was written almost 70 years ago! Definitely the forefather of nearly ALL the dystopian fiction out there today. Orwell really had incredible foresight about how the world would become--even now in the news we are fed only what ""Big Brother"" wants us to believe. "
1811,Jocelyn,"This was a book that I have been meaning to read for years, but somehow just missed. 1984 was scary from the first to last sentence. I found it amazing that George Orwell was able to create a believable society - culture, politics, ideology and even language! The characters were hard to sympathize with and feel empathy for - I didn't feel they had much depth, which could have been how Orwell intended them - but even so, I felt afraid for both Winston and Julia when the telescreen repeats ""you are dead."" ""War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength."" ""2 + 2 = 5"" "
1812,Abhranil Dutta," WAR IS PEACE.  FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. These words are immensely powerful(*one have to read the book to know why!) and will remember it for rest of my life...!! Much better than 'Congress ka haath, Apke saath' :P This book is so intense that one would feel an instant hate and fear against the all communist parties ever existed on the face of the earth..!! (*atleast i felt so*) Though his predictions didn't come true , but one cld see glimpses of such terror in countries such as North Korea ..!! ""It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth. in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not remain stable"" - George OrwellI wonder what the communist parties have to say abt dis ..?!?!? Anywayzz overall a good book and everyone must read dis atleast once ..!!"
1813,Yc9gg,"George Orwell’s 1984 is a literary political fiction and dystopian science-fiction in which such things as full dictatorship, mass surveillance of the population, never ending war take place. It's nearly unbelievable how the work itself is almost like a foreseeing of some of our present’s events such as the constant war between countries and the fact that governments gather more and more information about the population of Earth to fight against terrorism. The total control of the flow of information, the demagogy and the oppression of the people is clearly visible in the slogans of the Ministry of Truth or “Minitrue”: “War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength”. This is the place where Winston Smith works, which is one of the four governmental ministries in Oceania. They change the historical records here to become the same with what the Big Brother says. The novel inspired many writers and works and in 1984, Orwell invented dozens of terms, which we use in our everyday life such as 2+2=5, Big Brother, doublethink, thoughtcrime, etc. We also use the word “Orwellian” if a current situation or an act of a company reminds me of what we can read in this book. What Winston would like to achieve and feel in 1984 is perfectly told in one of his sentences: “Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two makes four. If that is granted, all else follows.”1984 will definitely make you think for days if not weeks about the similarities between the events of the book and real life and the brilliance of Orwell's predictions about what the world can become."
1814,Jenny,"Äntligen har jag läst denna klassiker och så obehaglig den var sedan. Det kändes verkligen som om Storebror såg en medan man läste 1984. Det gick aldrig att riktigt släppa.Jag fångades direkt av handlingen och huvudkaraktären Winston. Orwell har verkligen lyckats med att skapa den rätta känslan av att det är en dystopisk utopi. För karaktärerna är samhället en utopi, det perfekta samhället, men för läsaren är det den hemskaste dystopin. Vi ser hur hjärntvättade alla är men kan inte göra något åt det. Det är så här som dystopier ska vara, tycker jag. Det är sådana här romaner som sätter sig på hjärnan och sådant som man sent kommer att glömma.Trots att Winston inte är särskilt trevlig är det lätt att gilla honom. Jag tror i alla fall att det är meningen att man ska gilla honom. Det är genom honom vi uppfattar handlingen och det är också han som står för vår individualitet och vår rätt till att välja själv. Han är en intelligent karaktär och klarar av att diskutera och analysera Storebrors handlingar genom romanen. Han är däremot rejält paranoid och impulsiv vilket försätter honom i flera jobbiga situationer i romanen.Romanen håller oss på tårna och tar flera dramatiska vändningar. Som läsare kan man aldrig vara riktigt lugn för då det är alltid då man slappnar av som det sker något livsavgörande för någon av karaktärerna. Det skedde en rejäl plot twist på slutet som jag vet att jag borde ha väntat mig men som ändå kom som en överraskning.Det var en klassiker värd namnet som jag verkligen kan rekommendera! Det är en roman som alla borde kunna gilla!"
1815,Ruthie Jones,"Terrifying! It's amazing and horrifying how malleable the human mind can be. The society outlined in this book has happened, is happening, and will always happen as long as there are people on this earth who are obsessed with power and control over the masses. In fact, our minds are easily washed just by our own media and even the people we interact with. Thought provoking, isn't it? Despite the book's negative ending, I firmly believe that love will always prevail - even though the cost is high."
1816,Moni,"This is just about my all time favorite book, for many very odd reasons, one - I read it when I was nine. Okay, that's exaggerating, I was probably at least eleven, but in any case I was very young and just absolutely devoured this concept of controlling the past and living in an endless present. Sex as an uncontrollable instinct that could be twisted and diverted was also an image that stuck with me - I'm a recovering Catholic, it was bound to happen. I think at that age though the idea that really stuck with me was Newspeak. At first it was fascinating to embrace the concept as a math problem - how many words could you really eliminate by using suffixes and prefixes... then it occurred to me how utterly fascinating that was, to control people's ability to think and imagine by literally destroying the words necessary to do so. I grew up a very prudish convservative child, and this brilliant book about totalitarianism broke my brain and made me the wonderfully liberal freak that I am today."
1817,CHris.T.o.S,I feel that i have no right to judge this book.....But the only thing i can say is that besides the greatness its influences are everywhere...Remarkable!
1818,Samar,كتاب يوضع في رف مختلف عن بقية الكتب،كتاب يجعلك تدرك أن حياتك وهم كبير،كتاب يجعلك تفهم أكثر عن الأشخاص الذين يتحكمون بحياتك وانت لاتعلم ويجعلك تفهم أنك مخدوع حتى الآن ولن تعرف ذلك إلا بعد قراءة هذا الكتاب.لتنام بسلام جورج أورويل.
1819,justme,"Εντελώς ψυχοπλακωτικό και καθηλωτικό, ειδικά από τη μέση και μετά... :/"
1820,Krystin,"I have nothing to say but to acknowledge the sheer brilliance of this classic. This is my first book (definitely, not my last) by George Orwell, and I find that his writing is just amazing.The dystopian world that he created was incredibly intricate especially its language, Newspeak. I found it clever and how much sense it made to build a society who thinks the way you want them to by inventing a new language system. Like, how can you think of something if you have no way of describing or defining it?The world in 1984 was also scary and terrifying if you actually think about it. When you try to draw comparisons with the world we are living in today, the similiarities are definitely there, although very subtle. Although one of the things I felt to be a little extreme was the constant alteration of history. It a little crazy and hard to swallow, then again the whole Big Brother was crazy and that was what made it so interesting.The ending was justified, in my opinion. In the end, we really are just pawns to the higher ups no matter how much we try to rebel. I am glad I read this as it had opened my mind and made me think."
1821,Jairus Reddy,The book is just pure genious in my opinion.
1822,Dina Eissa,"رواية لا تملك معها إلا الانبهار من عبقرية هذا الذي يستقرئ واقعنا اليوم في روايته المكتوبة منذ 65 عاما .. مع صفحات الكتاب يتبادر إلى ذهنك تلقائيا مواقف و أحداث عاصرتها في واقعك و تجد هنا تفسيرها .. لأول مرة أسمع عن مبدأ ازدواجية التفكير و أفزعني كم هو يسيطر على عقول كثيرين نراهم و نسمعهم .. و ما أكثر الأوقيانيين في مجتمعاتنا !!ذلك الحزب الحاكم الذي ينصب نفسه إله على العامة المهمشين بلا وزن هدفه السلطة و السلطة فقط و إلى الأبد ..يصنع الخوف و الكراهية و يقمع الحريات و الأفكار و يزيف الحقائق و يتحكم في الإنسان و العقول و التاريخ و الذاكرة العامة ..كم هو متعدد و لكن بأسماء مختلفة في بلدان مختلفة !!بقدر ما كان الجزء الثاني فيه بعض الملل بسبب انتقال الإسلوب من الرواية إلى المقال السياسي و لفترة طويلة و بقدر ما أردت أن أنقص التقييم نصف نجمة لهذا السبب .. بقدر ما حرصت على قراءة كل كلمة و استيعابها و تلقائيا تتابعت الاسقاطات على الحاضر.هناك بعض التعبيرات تستحق التوقف و التأمل فيها(الولاء يعني عدم التفكير، بل هو عدم الحاجة للتفكير. الولاء يعني عدم الوعي)(إن كان هناك من أمل فهو في العامة)(لكي يثوروا يجب أن يعوا، ولكي يعوا يجب أن يثورووا)(هم يريدون أن يلغوا إنسانيّتك .. ولذلك فأن تحافظ على إنسانيّتك حتى موتك هو ما يعني انتصارك عليهم , حتى لو لم يؤدّ ذلك إلى أيّ نتائج !)(لماذا نعذّب لماذا نسرق لماذا نستبدّ لماذا نقتل لماذا نحكم طيلة حياتنا ثمّ نورّث الجمهوريّة لأبنائنا ؟!: إننا ندرك أنه ما من احد يمسك بزمام السلطة و هو ينتوي التخلّي عنها , إن السلطة ليست وسيلة بل غاية , فالمرء لا يقيم حكما استبداديا لحماية الثورة , و إنما يشعل الثورة لإقامة حكم استبدادي , إن الهدف من الاضطهاد هو الاضطهاد , و الهدف من التعذيب هو التعذيب , و غاية السلطة هي السلطة ... هل بدأت تفهم ما أقول الآن ؟!! )باختصار .. رواية عبقرية يجب أن تقرأها بفكرك قبل عينيك"
1823,Suzanne Tanaka,Sorry society didn't heed the warnings George. Noone can say that you didn't TRY.
1824,Cami,"This book, through all of its politics and frustrating elements of the future, was a great read. Although I was forced to read it through curriculum I would have enjoyed reading it on my own. Published in the 50's, George Orwell creates a futuristic version of a place where the people are controlled fully by the government. Winston Smith is just another person in the world, working on a less than fair wage, eating food that can only fulfill one for a short time, drinking bad liquor and hoping to survive. Here, you cannot have absurd thoughts because Big Brother is always watching. War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. "

1826,Loránd Szakács,"“Being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.”I don't think that anything captures the spirit of the book better than the above quote. Orwell manages to convey the depressing atmosphere of the infamous totalitarian regime perfectly. In this world, even the most menial day to day experience becomes a tragic struggle. "
1827,Kara,"1984 is a shocking description of what life would be like under the complete control of the government. Its audacious amount of gritty detail proves Orwell's strength in his beliefs as he pleads with society to see the cons of large government. Though I wouldn't say I enjoyed the novel, I am happy that I've read it. Orwell clearly states his message, and the first read is all it really takes for an audience to understand. I would not read it again, but I would suggest that others read it at least once."
1828,مهنا,عندما بدأت في هذه الرواية ، شعرتُ أنني سأنتهي منها كسنخة أخرى من تشي جيفارا ، و أوقظ الكائن الثوري الذي بداخلي . لكن بعد إنهائي لها ، شعرتُ أنني شاركتُ ونستون ذلك العذاب الذي تعرض له في وزارة الحب - خاصة عذاب الغرفة ١٠١- و كنت في كل مرحلة من عذاباته أضع نفسي مكانه بتلقائية ، و أسأل نفسي عمّا ستكون عليه ردة فعلي ؟ و في نهاية الرواية ، ساورني شعور مخزي و مؤلم - إلا أنه مريح بعض الشيء ، لا أدري كيف - وهو أنني سأنتهي لما انتهى إليه . هذه الرواية مرعبة . ليس لما تحتويه على مشاهد العذاب أو الوجع ، بل لما تحركه في نفسك من تساؤلات رهيبة ، تجعلك تواجه نفسك العظيمة و الوضيعة في الوقت نفسه . لا زلت أشعر إلى الآن بخدر خفيف في ركبتيّ ، ولا زلت أشعر باتساع هذا العمل الروائي في جوفي ، إنه مخيف ! 
1829,Jack Walker,"1984 was one of the first 'Classics' I ever read. It really changed my outlook on life because it creates a schism between ""Beliefs"" and ""Truths"" and explains to readers that just because you believe something to be true, that doesn't necessarily make it so. It changed my ideas of knowledge and challenged me to constantly ask myself what I actually know. The answer is very little. Some may debate whether this is a good or bad thing; but the ability to question everything, to research all, to revise your beliefs, to study and research and confirm what you think you know, is the entire point of this book. This book also raises valid and interesting points on media control, police state, surveillance, autocratic governments and class division. Overall, a thought provoking, culturally important piece, albeit confusing at times. "
1830,Cemre,"Ne desem ne yazsam pek bilemedim. Şöyle özetleyebilirim belki: ""Savaş barıştır. Özgürlük köleliktir. Cahillik güçtür.""Gerçekten korkunç bir sistem tasvir ediliyor kitapta. Yapılan her davranış ""Büyük Birader"" tarafından izleniyor. Yemek yemenizden tutun cinsel hayatınıza kadar her şey Büyük Birader'in, Parti'nin kontrolü altında. Sadece yaşayışınız değil hisleriniz, arzularınız ve de geçmişiniz de. Kültür yok, sanat yok, bilim yok, merak yok, arzu yok, mutluluk yok, cinsel istek yok, insani duygular yok. Hiçbir şey yok. Sadece Parti'nin istediği gibi yetişen ve yaşayan insanlar (?) var. Düşünmeniz yasak. Size ne söyleniyorsa onu benimsemek zorundasınız, benimsemezseniz inanın bana çok başarılı (!) şekilde benimsetiyorlar. Siz ne kadar Büyük Birader'in ve de Parti'nin ateşli savunucusu olursanız olun zekasını kullanabilen herkes ciddi tehlike arz ediyor ve yok ediliyor. Geçmiş kontrol ediliyor. Yok ediliyor, Parti'nin lehine olarak düzenleniyor. Muhalifleri direkt öldürme diye bir şey yok; onları kendilerine benzetme var, kendilerini kabul ettirme var.Her ne kadar Stalin döneminin eleştirisi dense de bence şu an da dahil olmak üzere her zamana ait bir roman Bin Dokuz Yüz Seksen Dört; çünkü iktidar hırsı, iktidarı elde tutma hırsı insanlığın başından beri var olan bir şey. ""İktidar bir araç değil, bir amaçtır. Kimse devrimi korumak için diktatörlük kurmaz; diktatörlük kurmak için devrim yapar. Zulmün amacı zulümdür. İşkencenin amacı işkencedir. İktidarın amacı iktidardır.""Unutmadan, çeviri de oldukça başarılıydı, Celâl Üster'i tebrik etmek gerek. Mutlaka okunmalı."
1831,Osama Yousry,This novel consumed me. I couldn't stop reading it. yup.
1832,Nga Dao Quynh,"It is unmistakably a spectacularly outstanding masterpiece from Orwell! I attempted in vain several time when trying to get one in Vietnam, just to grab it nearly a year later when stumbling on a cramped corner of secondhand books in Harvard Bookstore. The version was quite old and tore and rather yellowish (but I like old books slightly more than those new : D), which I then gave up to one of my closest friends as a gift from US. Some months later, finally I got the firm hold by some book vouchers in Kinokunya, Singapore :) (Okay I am such a miserably poor undergrad) Now I can tell you 1984 gave me that first kinda-funny-journey to officially call it mine =DYet apparently my reading progress was sluggish like it may take forever. The whole part One appeared boring to me (which made me put the book down many times and pick it up again some weeks later) maybe it's because I had faintly known what to expect from the Ingsoc society, or because the author was indeed trying to paint a grey and dull picture (and he succeeded very much). But starting from Julia's appearance and then official position of O'Brien, I can't stop devouring. The society's scenario with countlessly mysterious ways citizens are helplessly, unknowingly manipulated and suffocated stirs up inside the fear that one day technology together with cold blood of politicians and power will take us to that end. The nauseating, malignant indifference between people and people was portrayed blatantly and so convincingly that I tempted to think it had to happen somewhere, or it is just about to happen. And the last man of ""Winston's kind"", as O'Brien put it, who was twisted, tortured, even brain-washed was after all a skeleton hopelessly clinging in the verge of extinction. The ending still remains hauntingly unchanged. Even up until the bloody interrogation of O'Brien, I had the inexplicable hope that O'Brien was still in the side of the right, of 2+2=4, of Goldstein. At least he was co-author of The Book. The hope was yet, fading. Another stunning point (maybe I am reinstating) is that the whole story stayed strikingly real and vivid. In each O'Brien's conclusion, persuasion, threat, admonishment, I just can foolishly and feebly defend. Maybe I am too frivolous to take them all in, but I am telling you the truth. There was one sentence, roughly - What do men can really perceive from outside, saving through his own mind? (sorry I'm not able to find the quote now). And the meaning is still now hovering over my head. Anyway, I humbly admit I don't have much knowledge to interpret this whole story, and I believe that there is much much much more behind every words and details I overlooked. I am still thinking what the ""greatest secret"" is when Winston just put The Book down.. As I am not lucky enough to be taught this novel when I was in school, hope I can find sometimes to see other reviews to learn more, and furnish this review very soon : ) Religion and politics are always appealing.Last note, I may not get this whole things up my mind if I kept delaying my reading. Sometimes you will be (positively) amazed by what was waiting in the end. Keep going. "
1833,Nimra Khan,"This review is going to be extremely inadequate, no matter what. The fictional depiction of life in a dystopian society in this book is terrifyingly amazing. Lose yourself in this world created by George Orwell but not too much, it will give you the chills. Apart from the horror factor, this book should prove to be your Achille's heel if you love conspiracy theories. Human brain and nature have been stretched to their limit in Oceanic Society. It definitely nudges the reader to think about the world he lives in and that our lives are not simply for ourselves to live but also for co-existing with other human beings.In short, the 5 stars rarely awarded by me should speak louder than my review."
1834,Hanneke,"Een bijzondere leeservaring om 1984 na meer dan dertig jaar te herlezen. Ik was vergeten hoe beklemmend dit boek is. Of misschien vind ik het nu veel meer beangstigend omdat ik steeds aan het huidige Noord-Korea, maar vooral aan Cambodja onder Pol Pot moest denken. Het streven van Big Brother en de partij top om het individu tot in het diepst van zijn gedachten en gevoelens af te breken, is wel degelijk uitgeprobeerd in een nog niet zo lang vervlogen verleden. Pol Pot was dat in grote mate gelukt. Hij was een waarachtige Big Brother, die miljoenen mensen de dood in dreef door marteling en uithongering in zijn poging om de geest en levensomstandigheden van de bevolking van Cambodja naar zijn ideaalbeeld om te vormen. 1984 is in heldere en duidelijke taal geschreven. Zo knap hoe Orwell de macht van Big Brother kan illustreren door te beschrijven hoe woorden, die abstracties als liefde, verzet, vreugde uitdrukken, uit de taal worden verwijderd, zodat men in de toekomst ook niet meer weet wat die begrippen inhouden. Dat is absolute macht! Ik hoop op een tijd dat 1984 een curiositeit uit het verleden is geworden. Helaas kunnen we dat nu nog niet zeggen. "
1835,Porsche,I think you have to be a certain age . . . or least have a certain amount of life experiences to really feel this book. I for one didn't get it at all when we were going over in school. But the post college struggle to start a career and make enough to live off of really put in the right frame of mind to relate the to the main character. This is another one of those books that changes the way you see everything in the world. 
1836,Leixiao,hopelessness....
1837,Carlos Alves,"Este é um dos meus livros preferidos. Vemos o mundo através dos olhos de Winston Smith, enquanto o autor nos descreve o partido totalitário que governa 1/3 do mundo e a maneira como a personagem principal se vai apercebendo de todas as técnicas de controlo usadas pelo Partido. Separado em 3 partes, 1984 é uma mistura entre um romance e um ensaio, sendo a primeira parte introdutória, a segunda e a terceira com mais teorias e mais densas. O fim do livro não é bonito, sendo dos mais tristes que já li. Mas finais bonitos não era o que o autor queria, aliás, a história parece que está em segundo plano, em relação à parte ensaio do livro, e é essa parte que assusta, pois após se ler este livro, ninguém fica o mesmo, olhamos para o nosso mundo de maneira diferente e pessoalmente, fiquei com medo que algum dia o que está escrito no livro possa vir a acontecer, que algum Big Brother possa estar ou vir a estar a olhar para mim.""WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH"""
1838,Eva Mejicano,"Para leer la reseña completa visita mi blog Perspecteva1984 es un libro que debería ser de obligatoria lectura. En él se describe una sociedad sujeta al control absoluto de un partido político socialista, que ha tergiversado su aparente propósito inicial de mejorar la vida de los pobladores hasta convertirlo en una dictadura férrea donde la realidad se dibuja y se vive en función de lo que cree el Partido.«En cierto sentido, la visión del mundo que tenía el Partido se imponía con éxito a gente incapaz de entenderla.»Orwell ha descrito un mundo distópico en el que existen tres superestados: Esteasia, Eurasia y Oceanía, formados por la agrupación de varios países (sin consideraciones continentales), y que se mantienen aislados entre sí. A pesar de ello, funcionan de la misma manera: tienen sistemas políticos totalitarios, controlan la vida y los pensamientos de los ciudadanos, y se enfrentan a una guerra constante entre sí. El ambiente bélico, la escasez de recursos, el aislamiento y el poco valor que tiene la vida hacen que los pobladores de los superestados dependan sin miramientos de sus gobernantes, considerándoles sus salvadores.La historia se desarrolla en un Londres muy distinto al que conocemos hoy día. El protagonista, Winston, trabaja para el Departamento de Archivos del Ministerio de la Verdad adecuando documentos, registros, publicaciones, y cualquier cosa escrita en el pasado a lo que dice actualmente el Partido; la intención es que la realidad actual que describe el Partido sea la única verdad existente. «Quien controla el pasado –decía el Partido– controla el futuro. Quien controla el presente controla el pasado»Sin embargo, desde la primera página se descubre que Winston está en conflicto. Cada vez más le asaltan los recuerdos de una infancia junto a su familia en mundo funcional, libre y sustancialmente diferente al que conoce hoy. No está seguro si se trata de recuerdos o imaginaciones suyas, e intenta por distintos medios corroborar lo que su mente sabe. Pero no se detiene allí, su creciente frustración y convencimiento de que el Partido es el culpable de la vida miserable que tienen le hacen acometer pequeñas y peligrosas acciones ""rebeldes"", que de ser descubiertas podrían costarle la vida. Así, comienza a escribir un diario en el que registra sus dudas, pensamientos y sentimientos en contra del Partido, mantiene una relación clandestina con Julia y entra en contacto con O'Brien, un miembro del Partido Interior (grupo social más alto, privilegiado y con poder de decisión; el más cercado al Hermano Mayor y al Partido) que Winston cree que pertenece a la Hermandad, movimiento social que se opone al Partido y que es perseguido, condenado y repudiado por la mayoría de la población.Como era de esperarse, en un mundo donde se controlan hasta los pensamientos de las personas, estas acciones no podían pasar desapercibidas por el gobierno. Winston fue, progresivamente, cayendo en la telaraña montada por el Partido para conocer sus verdaderos sentimientos hacia ellos, y de esta manera tener argumentos con los cuales quebrarle psicológicamente cuando le atrapasen. Hacia el final del libro nos encontramos a un protagonista que ha pasado de ser un ser humano con criterio, aspiraciones y deseo de superación, que cuestiona el status quo y desea cambiar su realidad, a una persona que ha perdido la chispa, parecido a un espectro, cuya existencia se debe a la naturaleza de supervivencia que todos tenemos, por lo que sigue respirando, comiendo y desplazándose. Winston termina convencido de su error, y con la certeza de que el Partido siempre gana, y que siempre ha debido y debe ser así. "
1839,Anshu Malee,"A tight schedule, although I managed to finish this book within a week( here week ends in sunday smile emoticon )You dont need any adjectives/compliments for classics like this! Being too good is their inherent feature!Form what I could perceive, 1984 is a more comprehensive, more elaborative and more philosophical (but less satirical version) of his other one 'Animal Farm'. Unlike animal characters and farm here he builds a fiction of future(1984) where world is divided into 3 superstates and are in continuous war with each other!""War is peaceFreedom is slaveryIgnorance is strength""George Orwell imagines a world where people are ruled by a single party for whom they work and get feed instead! A restricted world where people get thoughts and ideas implemented on them by party and any alternative thought is 'thoughtcrime'! Every word party speaks is a fact and rest is false! Anybody against this belief is vapourised!Story revolves around a character in this scenario!1984 is basically alternative-ideologial, negative utopiasm type essay-fiction where writer repeatedly focus on theory (opposite to communism or socialism) to say creating a world without class or hierarchy is literally impossible!It is a good horror novel with writers 'doubleplusgood' skill to express political ideology by a way of excellent fiction!A must read for people who have interest in sociology and political ideology!"
1840,Geil Schock,"1984, by George Orwell is an incredible novel illustrating the effects that unchecked power can have on a world. When an authority controls all aspects of life by degrading basic human values (family, relationships, learning from the past) it can influence anybody no matter how resistant. Orwell uses the character of Winston to explain this predicament by making the reader understand his emotions. He lived a dull sorrow without a family (after his mother and sister disappeared) or love, yet only now does he realize the lies he has been fed. His path towards realization and rebellion slowly reveals the immense power that ‘Big Brother’ and the ‘Inner-Party’ hold over Oceania. This ties back to the idea that “Who controls the past controls the future”. No matter how sure an individual may be that his government is lying and abusing power, he cannot prove them wrong when they control all sources of information. Winston’s hopelessness in the ‘Ministry of Love’ is a key factor in illustrating how doomed humanity is if we allow such a government to prosper. Orwell’s story serves as not only a warning but an insight into our own humanity. If what makes us human (on a philosophical level) is our values that we hold ever-so-close, then their elimination would leave just the shell of what once was — a programmable puppet that is unable to comprehend anything that defies the will of authority (Big Brother).Everything on Earth in 1984 is a ploy to keep nations in a constant state of fear and vulnerability without an end in sight. The novel claims that even if 2/3 nations ally themselves against the third, the lone nation could still not be beaten. This is similar to Goldstein’s book and the ‘Brotherhood’ because their existence only serves to weed out the traitors and anger the patriotic citizens. The novel in such a deeply thought out universe that it does not seem completely unreasonable to believe that a similar situation could occur in the future, and for that reason 1984 by George Orwell deserves 5 stars."
1841,Non Nomen,"With no doubt, George Orwell's 1984 is one my greatest influences as a writer. In my humble opinion, this is Orwell's masterpiece and a true landmark in world literature."
1842,Celine -Are You My Mummy? Doctor Who Fan-,"A good book, but not a happy one. It's very thought provoking and makes you analyze everything in society now. "
1843,Samantha,"What I like the best about 1984 was how realistic it is. In modern distopian books, the protagonist has either some unordinary super-power or manages to save the world of the government's exploitations. But in 1984, the main charcter is just an ordinary man. He is middle aged, (somewhat) overwight, and has a vericose veins. He isn't an obvious threat or even an obvous main character. It's not so much that he is a relatable level (I cannot relate to him very much), but that his flaws automatically set him up for failure. It's inevitable; which is real. Failure is imminent. Which leads to the plot twist at the end. The realness of the human spirit also made this book so wonderful. He finds love in a fellow rebel. Love isn't evem allowed-making them rebellious in every sense. The fact that the romance isn't dramatized or romanticized is a whole concept foreign to modern distopians. While Winston and Julia relish in each other's company, they do not truely love each other. In the end, the human drive to live takes over. They chose to surivive than die for each other-something that would never happen in a modern distopian. The ending of 1984 is what separates it completely from the other's of it's genre. Orwell ends the book with the protagonist falling into the graps of Big Brother. He does not win, he is no longer an individual. He is a product of society-he dies loving Big Brother. He has fallen victim to the thing that he strived to detroy. What cause he was once willing to die for, he died in spite of."
1844,Robfussell,The eighties were effed-up
1845,Heba El-Khouly,"not only reading it ,, i'm studying it from A to Z :)so excited :)"
1846,erjan k.,"very strong book, very dramatic, i believed the main hero will finally crush the system, let people free. but he failed and became part of the system.i would recommend it to anyone, it is not like an american movie where good fellas kill bad fellas. it is a dystopia.in the end the party and system make Winston betray his lover Julia, both physically and mentally. when they meet again - they have no feelings, they hate each other.the system not only crushes your body, it crushes your soul. this is the hardest realization, it also has lots of philosophical claims on politics and nature of power.5/5 now i know why this read is recommended."
1847,Christopher,Nothing has scared me more in literature than part 3 of 1984. Absolutely creepy!!!!
1848,Sheesha70,"انتهيت من قراءة رواية جورج أورويل 1984 و التي ستناقش اليوم في لقاء نادي الكتاب تأتي هذه القراءة الثانية باللغة العربية و يفصلها ما لا يقل عن ١٥ سنة من القراءة الاولى باللغة الانجليزية .. بالتأكيد القراءة الثانية كان لها بعد و استيعاب اكبر في ظل نمو الوعي الثقافي و الفكري و في ظل الاحداث المتلاحقة في عالمنا .استوقفتني الكثير من الاقتباسات و التي تشكل الأساس الفكري للرواية سأذكر البعض منها فقط: ""المرء لا يقيم حكما استبداديا لحماية الثورة و انما يشعل الثورة لاقامة حكم اسبدادي""""اننا نقوم بتدمير الكلمات اننا نسلخ اللغة حتى العظام""""بامكان من يسيطر على الماضي ان يمتلك المستقبل و من يتحكم بالحاضر ان يسيطر على الماضي""“الحرب هي السلام..الحريّة هي العبودية..الجهل هو القّوة”""لمن أكتب هذه المذكرات؟ أأكتبها للمستقبل؟ أم للأجيال القادمة؟""ارويل كتب هذه الرواية مع نهاية الحرب العالمية الثانية ربما تكون رؤيته للمستقبل صحيحة لما يحدث الآن .رواية على الأقل ستدفعك الى اسقاط بعض افكار ارويل على الواقع المعاصر فمهما اختلفت المسميات و اختلفت الفئات و الهيئات و الجغرافيات فالهدف يبقى دائما أبدا واحد....السلطة من اجل السلطة فقط تناولت الرواية الأساسيات التي تستند عليها الأنظمة الاستبدادية الشمولية ذات الحزب الواحد :١-انتهاك الخصوصيّة وفرض الرقابة و نظام شاشات الرصد٢- ازدواجية التفكير هي: “أن تعرف ولا تعرف، أن تعي الحقيقة كاملة ومع ذلك لا تفتأ تقص الأكاذيب محكمة البناء. أن تؤمن برأيين متناقضين وأنت تعرف أنّهما لا يجتمعان، ومع ذلك تصدق بهما، أن تجهض المنطق بالمنطق، أن ترفض الالتزام بالأخلاق فيما أنت واحدٌ من الداعين إليها. أن تعتقد أن الديمقراطية ضربٌ من المستحيل في حين أن الحزب وصيّ عليها. أن تنسى كل ما يتعين عليك نسيانه ثم تستحضره في الذاكرة حينما تمس الحاجة إليه. ثم تنساه مرة ثانية فورًا. فالمفكر الحزبي يعرف الوجهة التي تأخذها ذكرياته عند تغييرها. ويعرف بناءا على ذلك أنه يتلاعب بالحقيقة ولكنّه بممارسة ازدواجية التفكير يقنع نفسه بأنه لم يدنّس الحقيقة، ذلك هو الدهاء الكامل أن تفقد الوعي عن عمد ووعي. وعليه، ففلسفة الحزب لا تنكر صلاحية التجربة فحسب وإنما تنكر أيضًا وبكياسة وجود الحقيقة الظاهرة.”.ومن هنا يمكن الاستنتاج أنّ: كلما ازداد المرء فهما اتسعت هوة الوهم. وكلما اتقد ذكاؤه كان أقل حكمة. والمثال الأوضح على ذلك هو حقيقة أن هستيريا الحرب تتأجج كلما ارتقى المرء في السلم الاجتماعي إذ لا يقف من الحرب موقفا عقلانيا إلا رعايا الأراضي المتنازع عليها.٣-إجهاض العقل وقتل التفكير: الولاء هو عدم الوعي. وهذا ما يقزّم دور العقل ويهمّش أهميّته في التجديد ورفض كلّ أشكال التعنّت والطغيان.٤-النظرة الماديّة:بمقتضى عبارة “إننا نسيطر على المادة بسيطرتنا على العقل. والواقع يكمن في جمجمة الإنسان”.٥-الضعف و القهر الإنسانيّ.٦-شعبٌ بلا تاريخ، شعب بلا ذاكرة، شعبٌ بلا مستقبل:ولمّا كان الاستبداد لوي عنق التاريخ وسُيطر على الماضي فضاعت ذاكرة المجتمع وبالتالي مستقبله. وهو ما يفسّر شعار الحزب الذي يجسّد النظرية السياسية: من يسيطر على الماضي يسيطر على المستقبل، ومن يسيطر على الحاضر يسيطر على الماضيونقرأ في صفحات الرواية: “وبهذا يصبح التأريخ عبارة عن لوح ممسوح، يعاد نقشه كلما كان ذلك ضرورياً..كل شيء قد تلاشى, في عالم مضلل, أصبح فيه حتى تأريخ السنة, عرضةً للشك”٧-اللغة والفكر:وفي “عالم 1984″ يتضح مدى البعد السياسيّ في تدمير اللّغة و هي أن الغاية النهائية للغة الجديدة هي التضييق من آفاق التفكير؟ بحيث تصبح جريمة الفكر في نهاية المطاف جرما مستحيل الوقوع من الناحية النظرية.الفكرة الكلية : هي السيطرة المطلقة على عقول الناس المسالة مسألة سيطرة و بالإمكان إحباط الكائن البشري تماماً حتى يؤمن بأي شيء تريد منه أن يؤمن به و هناك رسالة إيجابية :و هي ان من الصعوبة بمكان ان تنفذ الى راس احدهم و تسبر غوره فعلى الحكومة ان تقوم بأشياء مروعة مستمرة حتى تستطيع ان تغسل دماغ أفرادها من أفكارها بنجاح.

1849,Marina,"Se non l'avete letto, non avete letto niente."
1850,Jonathan Fry,"When my English teacher, the brilliant Dr Brigley, found out I was reading 1984 she made a comment that 'Orwell always was a bit of a pessimist'.Though this seems quite a stark description it is really quite accurate. It was written in the 1940s when 1984 seemed like the distant future so reading it in the 21st century runs the risk of completely destroying any suspension of disbelief, but, fortunately, this isn't the case. Though knowing any chance of the constant world wide war mentioned has no chance of happening anymore is re-assuring, but Orwell creates a dystopian world quite different from our own. Though it is set in the, for want of a better term, future, it is not futuristic in the way of other sci-fi's flying cars and space travel, it is more that society as we know it has been torn apart. It is written from the view of Winston Smith who works in the Ministry of Truth (which ironically writes propaganda and changes past records to suit them) in London, on Airstrip One in Oceania. Oceania is at war with 'Eurasia' but Winston thinks that they were once at war with 'Eastasia' and at peace with Eurasia, it is hard to say much more without giving things away, but in short Winston doubts his whole society and life.It is indisputable that Orwell has had a massive impact on our modern lives, this is widely regarded to be one of his greatest works, written only years before his death and coining several terms, for example the enigmatic 'Big Brother' and terrifying 'Room 101'.So to sum up, 1984 is one of those books that everyone should read (it was made 13th in the list of 100 best British works by the Modern Library in 1998) even if it can almost completely destroy all your faith in civilization."
1851,Jack Wilkin,"Since it is a prized classic of literature, the moment I saw it in HMV for £2.99, I had to get it. What is quite terrifying, despite being written in 1948, is that some of the issues in Winston Smith's world are happening now.The year is 1984, Winston Smith works in the record department, a branch of the Ministry of Truth. In this world, everything you do is observed and controlled by Big Brother. Telescreens listen to your conversations, love is an emotion that is being stomped out and the very idea of the past being set in stone is a lie.Like I said, this is happening now, which is shocking and really brings this book to heart. You have need to read this book! "
1852,Doaa Amin,"1984.... رواية مرعبة منذ ان انتهيت من قرائتها وأنا أشعر بالضيق ..أفكر كيف بالأحلام أن تنتهي بالكوابيس وكيف بالثورات التي تقوم كانتفاضات بشرية باحثة عن حق الانسان في الحرية والعدل والعيش الكريم تتحول الي ديكتاتوريات تسلب من الانسان انسانيته وتجعل من البشر قطيع في خدمة الفرد الحاكم ... تتحدث هذه الرواية عن الأنظمة الشمولية حيث دولة الحزب الواحد حيث كل شيء ينبع ويصب في بوتقة هذا الحزب,,حيث أنت مراقب طيلة الوقت (الاخ الكبير يراقبك) وتُحصي أنفاسك وتُنتهك خصوصيتك ,,حيث كل جرم يغتفر الا أن تفكر فهنالك شرطة الفكر التي لا تكتفي بأن تتفوه بكلمات وافكار معادية بل بوسعها أن تخترق عقلك لتري الافكار المخبأة داخله ثم تسام علي أثرها بأشد العذاب ,,فهنا ليس التعذيب جسدي وحسب بل هناك غسل الدماغ حيث يفرغونه من كل شيء ويعبئوه بما أرادوا حتي انك تصدق ان 2+2=5 ان أراد الحزب ذلك بل لا يكتفي بأن تصدق بل عليك ان تؤمن بذلك ابمانا لا يساوره اي شك .كتب جورج اورويل هذه الرواية عام 1949 يتصور فيه ما سيئول اليه العالم في العام 1984 ونحن الان في العام 2014 وبالاسقاط علي مجتمعاتنا وأنظمتنا الحاكمة الحالية فقد حالف اورويل كل التوفيق ,فنحن الان نعاني من هذه الانظمة التي كل غايتها السلطة ...والسلطة للسلطة فقط حيث انها غاية وليست وسيلة لاصلاح حال العباد .تمنيت ان تنتهي الرواية بأي بصيص من الأمل ولكنها جائت سوداوية تماما,,منيت نفسي طوال قرائتها بان البطل -ونستون_ سيظل قابضا غلي كراهيته للحزب وهذا الوهم المسمي بالاخ الكبير مخبئا اياها في أغوار نفسه كي يظل هناك امل بان هذا النظام المستبد سينتهي ذات يوم..ولكن الكاتب أبي الا ان يثبت بان هذا الاستبداد لم يكن فكري وعقلي وحسب بل وروحي ايضا...حيث أحب ونستون الاخ الكبير...وهنا اسقاط علي متلازمة ستوكهولم التي أصابت الكثير من شعبنا بان أحبوا جلادهم وخضعوا له خضوعا تاما."
1853,Nicholas Angeletakis,"1984 is truly one of the greatest books of all time. The story is particularly intriguing and the characters are three-dimensional each with their own problems and own thoughts. The world feels like it is real and not written in a literature book. Winston Smith is the protagonist who is against the corrupt government along with his lover,Julia. After meeting a man who is supposedly a member of a rebellion they become a part of it. What they do not know is that everything is set up. George Orwell makes you believe in the second part of the book that there is going to be a rebellion but it is all merely an illusion. Everything is great but the ending is simply breathtaking, perfectly written and chilling one of the greatest endings of all time. No other ending would be deserving of 1984, one of the best books ever written."
1854,Jessica Smith,"Still remains one of my favorite pieces of literature. I love it more and more the more I teach it, and I am always finding examples of Orwell's predictions in today's society. If this book was ever relevant, today is the day."
1855,Margaret Lesh,"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.That is the opening line of 1984, and it immediately gives the reader the sense that things are off kilter. It's a great first sentence. I first read 1984 in high school. My son is now in high school, currently reading it in his English class, so I decided to revisit this classic. There are so many things to say about it, I don't know where to begin. Besides being the most bleak dystopian view of a future in which the world's governments are oligarchies with a few individuals on the inside ruling through domination, and fear, I felt sadness at the plight of protagonist Winston Smith--Party member and simple cog in the bureaucratic wheel. He knows things aren't right in this world of cold, gray, bleakness where every thought and action is spied upon, known, and repercussions are certain. Winston gradually awakens to the notion that things might be better; that the world wasn't always dark and humans bereft of simple emotions. He begins to question the system of Big Brother's misinformation and the constant, as in daily, alteration of history. His awakening is hopeful in a sense where you feel yourself rooting for his hoped for revolution to move society forward, but on the other hand, there's the sense that poor Winston's got one foot in the grave.Orwell has created this fantastic tension. I was riveted, turning pages, even already knowing the outcome. The book within the book--a supposed text created by the underground opposition--while maybe a little on the dry side, was still a fascinating study in human nature and society.1984 has had a profound effect on modern culture with many of its words and phrases becoming part of our vocabulary such as doublespeak, Big Brother, Ministry of Truth, Thought Police, among others.Though quite depressing, this is a must-read. The ending will stay with me a while."
1856,Andrea Choi,"2+2=5In the world of 1984, there is no truth. Whatever the party says will be the truth. There is no way to verfiy the Party's claims, because no exteral evidence exists at all. Each person is strictly monitored and any expression of emotion other than loyalty towards the Party may make you seem suspicous. ""Comrades"" who have committed ""thoughtcrimes"" (having thoughts that doubt the Party and the Party's principles"" will be tortued in the most brutal manners, until your mind becomes a blank sheet again and that you are ready to accept the Party and its doctrines fully and whole heartedly. George Orwell has spent nearly half of his book explaining the functioning of this dystopia and the typical routine of a comrade's life. As an impatient reader, I was surprised to find that I actually liked this kind of structuring, because the immense details had help me to get fully absorbed into this very believable world. Just when I thought I was having an idea of where the storyline would go, there would always be a twist that sent chills down my spine. Interestingly, since this is such a complex story, it was the afterword written by Erich Fromm that helped me find a way to understand this story systematically. Rather than telling us that there is no such thing as human nature, the author in fact had assumed that humans do long for freedom, love and justice. The question is, ""can human nature be changed in such a way that man will forget his longing for freedom, for dignity, for integrity, for love -- that is to say, can man forget that he is human?""One other aspect that facsinated me most was how Orwell had questioned whether the past was alterable. What is reality? Is there reality? I don't have an answer for that, but I think it is a good start to have these questions in mind."
1857,Christine Vranas,"I have to agree with a lot of reviews. This book is as relevant today as the day it was written. I don't think we ""animals"" are capable of learning from history. We start out idealistic and never seem to understand that those ""revolutionary"" forces are most often the disguises put on by those who currently crave power to replace those who have it with themselves. No matter who ends up on top there seems to be total exploitation of those who work below them . Nine million people are now added to the list of individuals who have health insurance.(Good!) Health insurance premiums are constantly rising and the ones making all the money are not the physicians but the CEO's of hospitals and the insurance companies. The news is filled with stories that many covered by the ACA are soon losing it because it is not actually affordable. Meanwhile the red tape and regulations for physicians are increasing exponentially and physicians are filled with despair. There was some great quote by Orwell about the need to increase the number of technocrats to oversee the workers in order to justify their existence... etc etc. So this problem does not just apply to various governments but to the very policies that they create. Who is running the hospitals? Businessmen. Once upon a time in a land far far away called residency about twenty five years ago we were told by our program director that BIG BUSINESS looked around and saw that health care was the last frontier to be conquered in America. What is happening now to medical practices? They are being bought up by huge corporations. "" Come to us,"" they say. ""The government is coming to chew you all up and we will protect your lovely salaries and life style.""Read Animal House my friends. Read it and be aware. It is about the history of the Soviet Revolution and about current events of today."
1858,Mark Wallace,"The perfect dystopian book - often imitated, never bettered.Winston Smith's struggles with the totalitarian rulers of Airstrip One, with the all-pervasive technological snooping of the world he lives in and most of all with his own indoctrination and disillusionment are a story that hit the reader smack between the eyes.Orwell follows his own rules of writing clear English as laid out in the essay ""Politics and the English Language"", and the result is a stark narrative which delivers its meaning directly and without any mercy. The novel is sufficiently short and compelling that it can and should be read in one sitting. If you haven't read 1984, set aside a lazy Sunday and take in one of the greatest political lessons of the 20th century.It's also worth re-reading 1984 after reading Orwell's memoir of the Spanish Civil War, ""A Homage to Catalonia"", which reveals the impact of his experiences as a relatively starry-eyed socialist volunteer at the hands of the Stalinists who were supposed to be his allies. Like all the best science fiction, this is not escapism or fantasy, it is a biting criticism of the things the author saw in real life."
1859,John Merriweather,"George Orwell’s 1984John Merriweather George Orwell explores what would happen if a government were to control its people in a dominating fashion. He uses this intricate dystopian universe to show readers how easily government controls the people.  In 1984, Orwell demonstrates this dystopian society’s power using communism as a mold for their government. This civilization, in Oceania, presumably ruled by a single person known as Big Brother, lives in a state of ignorance so that the government can have total control. There are a few characters that aren’t completely absorbed into it all, including the protagonist, Winston. Orwell effectively uses Winston, an inner party member, to show his perspective on communism by giving him this trait, and having him question himself about the questionable aspects of society. When Winston realizes the corrupt government’s effect on everything, he rebels and searches for ways to destroy it. He ventures to the neighborhoods of the proletarians because he believes they are the only ones who might be able to change the ways of the government. There he finds an antique store, where he conducts several illegal acts in hopes to find the secret Brotherhood, but ultimately ends up being caught and transformed into one of the mindless and insane inhabitants of Oceania.  All suggested criteria are found in Orwell’s 1984. For example, propaganda. The figurehead Big Brother, another thing dystopian novels have, is seen on posters on buildings, walls, and everywhere you can fit one. Winston describes it as “never being able to escape the face of Big Brother.” Another example of needed criteria is the use of surveillance of some sort. Orwell meets this condition by adding telescreens. These are basically televisions that the government can use to constantly look upon their citizens and also give them commands. Yet another example would be the lack of individual freedom. This is shown by the constant surveillance by the telescreens and by one of three sayings seen on a building known as The Ministry of Love. “Freedom is slavery.” An ironic statement used also to illustrate the total power of the government.  George Orwell convincingly shows how detrimental a communist government is with this novel. He prompts readers to raise questions about the concept of a government as a whole when he introduces “The Book,” a novel containing the reasoning behind the government in 1984 and solutions to destroying it. When I read this it made me personally question several aspects of the government's power and made me realize things that I usually just looked over. He does this all with a powerful and well-written book, 1984."
1860,Brant O.,"Crazy and scary. A great story about the security state, society, inequality and becomes even more relevant as time passes. An outstanding book, and must read for students and fans of politics!"
1861,Bradley,"What's there to say? It's a fantastic book. Well-written. Well-thought out. George Orwell had this unique vision that, strangely, seems to be popping up all around us--especially now, since the government is sticking their domes into everything we're doing nowadays. In any event, this book is dark, depressing and terrifying. One of the better horror stories I've come across in quite some time. Lots more to say, but I won't bore you to tears. Just read it. And if you already did, congrats!"
1862,David Pimenta,"Decidi começar a ler o 1984 depois da minha professora de Teorias de Comunicação comentá-lo, persuadir-me a ler pela grande qualidade e já há algum tempo que tinha curiosidade em começar a lê-lo – pormenor que para esta crítica não têm muita relevância. Publicado em 1949, o enredo acontece na Oceânia, uma das super potências a dominar o planeta em conjunto com a Lestásia e a Eurásia. É dado a conhecer ao leitor a história de Winston Smith, um funcionário do Ministério da Verdade na Oceânia, terra que se encontra em guerra constante com um dos outros dois países e mantém o outro como aliado. Basicamente, a guerra contada no livro assemelha-se a um triângulo: a Ocêania contém um aliado e juntos fazem a “base do triângulo” contra o outro país. O governo retratado é completamente totalitário e controlador da mente dos cidadãos, de forma a controlar a vida de cada um através de “telecrãs”, presentes nas casas de todos. A tirania deste governo é retratada através do chamado Grande Irmão, o “Big Brother”, grande presidente do chamado Partido Interno, controlador da Oceânia. Grande Irmão nunca antes visto a não ser em cartazes espalhados pela cidade, em fotografias, em retratos. O trabalho de Smith é retificar artigos que faziam parte dos arquivos históricos do país, alterar um pormenor ou outro de vez em quando dos jornais que seriam colocados a circular no dia seguinte pela Oceânia. Mas apesar de ser um trabalhador exemplar de início, o leitor vai acompanhar a sua revolta interna contra o Partido e contra o Grande Irmão.Não posso contar mais da história, foi uma delícia se querem que seja sincero. Orwell imaginou uma sátira brilhante de uma sociedade no futuro completamente totalitária. Se não fosse tão boa não teria servido para criar, depois dos anos 90, os programas nos diversos países inspirados no conceito do Big Brother, “o olho que tudo vê”. Vemos a História da Humanidade ser alterada, os nossos conceitos básicos sobre a nossa vivência atual a ser questionada: como viver com observadores a todos os minutos? Com tantas restrições como: não ser permitido apaixonar-se por alguém, a não ser pelo Partido, não se pode questionar qualquer informação dada. 2+2 são 4? Ou são 5? Adorei a história como a forma é contada. A ilusão que nos é transmitida ao longo das páginas de uma suposta revolta, o amor como uma forma de rebelião. Achei fascinante e diria mesmo que com as tecnologias de hoje será que não estamos sempre a ser observados ou no nosso caso, escolhemos ser observados? Gostava mesmo de contar muito mais mas deviam ler vocês! É tão bom este livro, já são dois ótimos que leio este ano. Recomendadíssimo!5/5"

1864,Bones,"“La libertad consiste en poder decir que dos y dos son cuatro. Admitido eso, se deduce todo lo demás”“Cada año habrá menos palabras y el rango de conciencia será cada vez menor”Da miedo como las cosas relatadas en este libro son un buen ejemplo de lo que fue la dictadura militar en diferentes partes, o bastante parecido a lo que sigue ocurriendo en Korea del Norte.Nuestro personaje principal, Winston Smith es un miembro del Partido, y el se encarga de “arreglar” la historia ya escrita para que coincida con lo que dice el Hermano Mayor (ente que si sabemos si existe). Básicamente, escriben las cosas para que los números estén a favor de ellos y desacreditando a los oponentes. Ya desde el principio ves que Winston tiene sus con respecto al HM y a toda la sociedad. No comprende como la gente puede pensar determinadas cosas y ser engañadas tan rápido.Bueno… Yo sabía que su fe ciega lo iba a llevar a tomar decisiones tontas. Resulta que tenia razón.En as primeras 2 partes del libro Winston intenta comprender que es lo que gana la sociedad haciendo determinadas cosa, como fomentar el odio y eso.La tercera parte creo que fue la que mas me gusto, porque intentan jugar con tu cabeza para que piensen sientas cosas que son contrarias a las que vos sabesCon respecto al final, crudo. Bastante crudo. Pero… si te pones a pensarlo te das cuenta que sabias que iba a terminar así. Se lee muy rápido, lo único que me hizo para un poco fue cuando leí los capítulos de “El Libro” muchos de los términos e información me mareaban un poco. Aun así, es un libro muy bueno que sin duda releeré en algún momento. No hay muchos personajes secundarios, pero los que hay son bastante interesantes. Creo que hay detalles que me perdí leyéndolo la primera vez. "
1865,Pantalaimon,"Distopia in OceaniaLetto in inglese spontaneamente all'età di 18 anni, ne rimasi così positivamente colpito da decidere di far ruotare l'intera tesina della maturità attorno al tema della propaganda, solo per poter includere questo fantastico libro, che rimane ancora il mio libro preferito IN ASSOLUTO. (""Alice nel paese delle meraviglie"" e ""Il giovane Holden"" sono giusto dietro l'angolo, ma il primo posto è ancora prepotentemente occupato!). Di un'attualità sconvolgente per qualunque momento in cui si decida di leggerlo e a dir poco profetico per l'anno in cui è stato pubblicato, il romanzo più famoso di Orwell cattura dall'inizio e trascina fino all'ultima riga dell'ultima pagina. Considerato il romanzo distopico per eccellenza, è forse l'unico romanzo finora che mi abbia spaventato e causato ribrezzo dal tanto che mi sono immedesimato e dalla maestria con la quale siano state scritte poche righe. Mi riferisco in particolare alla scena in cui Winston viene a contatto con il proprio incubo. ""La fattoria degli animali"""" diventa una lettura obbligata per continuare l’opera di Orwell."
1866,Carlos Martins,"Ótimo livro! Trouxe uma ótima reflexão sobre sociedade, política, poder e liberdade. PS.: eu seria um prole, fácil."
1867,Javi,"La calidad de este libro es directamente proporcional al sufrimiento que te hace sentir a partir de, más o menos, el 70% del libro. Aunque más o menos esperas el final, e imaginas cómo será, yo no me esperaba en absoluto lo que sentí. Simpaticé tanto con el personaje que llegué a odiar a quienes le ponían las cosas difíciles.Sobre el libro no tengo mucho más que decir. Un libro que haga sentir un sentimiento de empatía y odio tan profundo debe ser, y es, considerado como una obra maestra de lectura obligatoria.Chapó."
1868,أحمد الشربيني,المعنى الحقيقة للدكتاتورية .. قمع، تعذيب ، ازدواج فكرى ، طمس الحقائق ، تزوير التاريخ ، انتزاع العاطفة ايه كمية الشر اللى موجودة فى الرواية دى .. هى رواية تقرأ ثم تقرأ من جديد :) عرفتنى على اشكال كتير ونظام فى الدولة القمعية والديكتاتورية وليه النظام مش عايز الشعب يتعلم وبيبقى همه ان الشعب يفضل فقير وجاهل انها السلطة كغاية وليست كوسيلة .. السلطة المطلقة 
1869,Josune,"George Orwell resultó para mí una luz, esos autores que consiguen maravillarte, a pesar de la dureza de la crítica que hace en 1984. Desde que leí ese libro no he vuelto a creer en los porcentajes que muestran en los telediarios ni en la tele ni en los periódicos, y soy periodista hihi. Es sin duda uno de los grandes autores, con una convicciones que hoy en día me cuesta ver en la literatura. "
1870,Winter Sophia Rose,"Emotionally Powerful,Gripping Read! A Classic!"
1871,Andy,"As I was reading 1984, I constantly was amazed it was written in 1948. I could have been convinced this was written in the '80s. The Big Brother nation that is presented in this book has real parallels to today, with the internet being the only technology not associated in the book (I half expected it to come up as I was reading the book because of how modern it seems). If Google were to align itself with the government, they would know what we are doing at all times. This book makes me want to get rid of my smartphone and not be on the internet so much (but I probably won't change). My goal in reading a book is usually to be forced to think about a particular topic or to get lost in a parallel universe. This one definitely gave me the former and unfortunately gave me the latter as well. I feared for my own life as I was nearing the end of the book. I loved this book (though there was a horrid stretch where a book was being read inside the book explaining what was already known). I definitely recommend this to everyone who is under the age of 40 (no offense if you are older, but I see the amount of technology in the hands of adults and children today as a way for all of us to be watched by the big technology companies). It opens your eyes as to what is possible in the future if civilization was to take a turn for the worst."
1872,Refah,"I know 1984 will rank as one of my favorite book since the first time I had heard it. I know this. But I keep postponing my intent to read it, since I feel like due to my age I will not be able to understand properly, and because I want to work on my English so that I can read it without much difficulty. But one day I was at my local bookstore, window-shopping, and I happened upon a translated copy of 1984 in one of the shelves. I didn't expect it at all and I was so shocked and happy at the same time that I paced around the shelves for some time to calm myself. I was seized by the sudden impulse to grab it and stuff it into my shopping bag, before I saw the publisher. I've read several books by this publisher, and most of them have shoddy translations; I even have to buy a copy of one of them in its original language to even remotely understand anything because the translation is that bad.But the book haunts me even as I got home. I agonized about it for days. Should I or should I not buy the book? Am I ready yet? Well, I decided finally, if I'm old enough to go to college I'm old enough to read the book. So I placed an order in one of those online bookshops and wait. When it arrived a week ago, I promptly read it.You must be wondering why it took me almost a week if I liked it so much? Well, because a book like this is like fine wine; you can't read it all at one but rather savor it slowly. And because this book is depressing as fuck, that's why. There were many times when I have to put the book down, draw a long sigh, then took a rest browsing for cute puppies and kittens pictures. The book gets to you. Its worldbuilding is so good that you can't help but get sucked into its world and feel the helplessness of the character. I was there, with Winston in London, trying to survive under constant censorship and squalor, despite the fact that we are separated by the pages of the book.Orwell has a vivid writing style. He can make his character and his world come to life with mundane words. Every author who thinks that the only way they can write well is by using the most superfluous words needs to read Orwell. Sure, sometimes his paragraph is long and confusing, but like I said, you need to savor it slowly like fine wine. You can't speed-read an Orwell. I usually felt bored upon encountering a wall of text in a novel, but with Orwell, the wall of text makes me feel excited. It doesn't bore me, not at all.Wow. I really don't have anything to add anymore. What can I say? Everything that needs to be said has been said in this book. You need to read it. That's all I'm going to say.(Adapted from my blog: paquetdevie.blogspot.com)"
1873,Shikhar Nigam,"Doubtless this book is a classic in that most of its 'predictions' as it were are coming true. There's doublespeak that exists, and ubiquitous surveillance a la Big Brother. Conformity is encouraged. Freethinking is admonished and in extreme cases met with vitriolic hate, sometimes leading even to murder. We are bombarded from all sides, especially screaming 'news' anchors about what 'enemy' to hate today and for what. And it changes every couple of days. We still haven't reached the levels of insanity as shown in 1984, but to my cynical mind, we are getting there.Yet, it is not for its prophetic nature that I adore this book. Rather, I like this book because in its relatively short length it makes me care for Winston. A lot. To the point that upon finishing the book, I actually just sat there for about five minutes mentally mumbling ""No, no, no, no"" to myself and being completely heartbroken at the soul-crushing and mind-numbing defeat that Winston faces. It really moved me and is my second favourite book ever. And I can guarantee that it will move you. Memorable QuotesThe essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance but the persistence of a certain world-view and a certain way of life imposed by the dead upon the living."
1874,Rana Deraz,"1984 should be read and reread over countless cups of coffee, until you've grasped the sheer genius of it. Orwell's prose is as elegant as it is descriptive, for he sets the atmosphere so eloquently that the dread is almost tangible. And the fact that it's a timeless prophecy gives the dread a realistic edge that it's almost frightening. This is the kind of book that haunts you long after you've finished reading it. I highly recommend it."
1875,Sammy Jenkis,"Scared, cold, lonely and an urge for wanting more. This book is clearly a page turner. Though George Orwell makes the world cruel and have you see only in blue with its ""Thought Police"", you start to see a ray of light with his vision of love and how it really is ""two against the world."" His view on a world that doesnt tolerate family, love, friendship, kindness, or race for that matter. Everyone is the same, and everyone is being watched. forever. I doubt anyone could say that they've had fun while having an anxiety attack. Reading this, you won't only have an anxiety attack, you'll have one while turning page after page smiling, frowning and sometimes just being angry...enjoying every minute of it.Before I read 1984, I was reading MYSTIC RIVER. At the time, someone very close to me had passed and I was going through alot. I remember putting MYSTIC RIVER back on the shelf and thinking that I had wanted something new. No mystery. No thriller. Certainly no how-to books either. I wanted to escape and George Orwell helped me do just that. "
1876,Amy Wallin,I went into 1984 with an incredible bias. I was in a bad mood – against classics and particularly the shove-it-in-your-face moral style of George Orwell. This is only the second Orwell novel I have ever read. I thought maybe Animal Farm was just written for children and that’s why the morals and metaphors were so… In your face. I read the first few pages of 1984 already pissed off. I could see where he was going. Don’t trust the government. They’re spying on you. Telling you what to think with media manipulation.Then I accidentally loved it. In another review I said that no one ever fan-girled George Orwell. I was so wrong. http://itsonlythree.wordpress.com/201...
1877,Jono,Finishing most books gives me a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment. I feel empty and hopeless. Maybe that's the point. 
1878,Brett,"Amazing book, a huge emotional impact is now scarred into my brain after finishing it. Everyone should read this."
1879,Jowayria Rahal," 1984 is one of the unfairly underrated books that everyone , at least once , should read !  This novel is simply not like any other . I don't think it fits well in the literary genre . No , it is way more bigger than that . It should be considered an exceptional case of literature marrying sociology to end up giving birth to a masterpiece on politics .  If there is hope it lies in the proles  Imagine individualism being a crime in a world where working , eating , drinking , reading , sleeping , talking .. In short, living is controlled -in every sense of the word - by the state . Imagine living under someone's eyes within a system that makes Hitler , Stalin and all of history's most notorious villains look like cowards ! Imagine being lured into believing that black is white and that 2+2 makes five . Don't imagine much because the world Orwell portrayed in his fictional novel is much relevant to ours today . This book will always be relevant because governments will always seek to control their populations through fear . It doesn't have to be terrorism or something of the sort , but anything that keeps  the proles  afraid and concerned about their well being so that they put their trust into a governing body . The less you reason, the more they govern !  You.Are.The.Dead  This book is frightening , dark ,horrendous and I just can't describe the chills it gave me . "
1880,Jenny Lee,"Definitely the best of the dystopian books I've read so far in terms of how much it challenged and engaged me intellectually. As an avid reader and lover of words, I also really like the appendix in which Orwell spells out the mechanics, and more importantly, the philosophy behind Newspeak. I definitely see the relevance of this section given how more and more people are forgoing reading in favor of tiny snippets of text found in Facebook comments and Buzzfeed ""articles"". As language loses its richness and diversity, there is a parallel impoverishment of the mind-- It would have been interesting to read Orwell's reaction to texting in the present day, in which language is reduced beyond what he imagined with Newspeak to mere strings of letters, like B4N. The constant fabrication and ""correction"" of news was also fascinating, since it already takes place in the present day---I'm reminded of the movie ""Wag the Dog"" and the ridiculous antics of our government and the media for various political campaigns such as the ""War on Terror"" and ""Shock and Awe."" A definite must-read for those who appreciate the enormous, and often misused, power of media, language, education and thought control. "
1881,Nisham,"The kind of information I have been searching for. Strong phrases. I can relate everything to the current situation of the world. Helped me see the society in another perspective, especially the political atmosphere. "
1882,Elham,کتابی فوق العاده که میشه گفت به سبک کافکا موضوعی باور ناپذیر رو پیش روی ما قرار میده و همونطور تو ناباوری ما ادامه ش میده.این کتاب گویی دنیا و فرهنگ و حتی زبانی نو رو بهمون آموزش میده که دنیایی رو توصیف میکنه که در اون عشق ممنوع است. دنیایی که حق دیدن حقیقت رو نداری و جورج اورول با شگفتی خاصی و تخیل بی نظیر عناصری چون پلیس فکر رو برامون گذاشته که حتی مسلط به آنچه در ذهن افراد در این دنیا میگذرد باشند..فصل آخر این کتاب مثل جاده ای پر دست انداز ساخته شه برای شوکه کردن شما در حدی که دوست دارید کتاب رو ببندید و دیگه ادامه ندیده از شدت شوکی که بهتون وارد شده...هرچه بیشتر به این دنیا فکر میکنید گویی اتفاقات اون رو در سطحی دیگه ولی کاملا آشنا در زندگی خودمون میبینیم.عالیه وسعت دید فوق العاده ای به خواننده میده و راه رو برای فکر کردن باز میکنه!
1883,Priscila,"Me gustó y me gustó muchísimo, pero es de esos libros que no se asimilan hasta unos días después.Tengo que procesar esto, porque extrañamente es uno de los libros que he leído que más miedo me da."
1884,Farnoosh Farahbakht,"در کتاب 1984 جهان بین سه ابر قدرت اقیانوسیه، اروسیه و شرقاسیه تقسیم شده که به مدت طولانی با هم در حال جنگ هستند. داستان در اقیانوسیه روایت می شود.و بخش اول کتاب به توصیف فضای حاکم می پردازد جایی که بزرگترین جرم ""اندیشه"" است و ""ناظر کبیر"" همیشه شما را می پاید. حریم خصوصی وجود ندارد و عشق و عواطف انسانی مرده است.با توصیفات بخش اول گاهی از خفقان موجود احساس نفس تنگی می کردم. در بخش دوم کتاب کور سویی امید به وجود آمد که با شروع فصل سوم جای خود را به اضطراب و وحشت از ""اتاق 101"" داد. 1984 توصیف دقیقی است از حکومت های تمامیت خواه (توتالیتر) که با خواندنش احساس می کنید بعضی صحنه ها و اتفاقات چقدر برایتان آشناست ! "
1885,Sowmya's book world,"WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. No matter how much we argue , this book was a glimpse of a real world. I really thank all my friends who recommended me to read this book. though i have taken really long time to finish this book, taking gap and re-reading it again after 2 month :) it was worth invest of time. "
1886,Jesse Houle,"One of those books I've always felt like I kinda knew even though I've never actually read it. Reading it was certainly worth it. Every time I read some of it I'd get in this funky mood. It definitely won't help me getting away from being super-skeptical and cynical about things. I'm still absorbing the book but I will say it is worth it and you should read it if you haven't- for sure, and soon!Couple of side notes:The book is very well written but for a period in the book he keeps using the word 'vaguely' to describe people's actions or how they say something. I know it's trivial, but it really annoyed me that he always chose to describe people's actions that way and never used any synonyms. I literally jumped up and cheered when he used 'indifferently' in lieu of 'vaguely' after getting about 120 pages in.Also Part 3 was far more brutal than I anticipated. It got pretty graphic and disturbing which was a pleasant (not sure if that's a good word here) surprise.Lastly, I don't what's going on down here in Georgia but I can't believe how many people here haven't even heard of this book nevermind read it. I like a lot about this place, but even the supposedly more progressive part of GA has an immense amount of people who unfortunately don't seem to know what a book is unless it's got praise for Jesus and/or contains voyeur snapshots of celebrities.Now that I think of it, someone needs to combine scuzzy celeb mags with the Bible. It's be the ultimate compilation of what makes this country so great. And I bet they'd make a killing."

1888,Raunak Ramakrishnan,"Great read. The plot, the social model, the amount of control the Party exerts on information flow and how by controlling vocabulary the state limits free thought - the adjective ""Orwellian"" now makes a lot more sense to me . The Newspeak appendix at the end is also quite interesting."
1889,Ana Mardoll,"1984 / 0-679-41739-7Painful, frightening, horrific. What do you do in a world where your every movement, every gesture is watched carefully by the government? How do you live in a world where even the slightest departure from complete conformity will result in torture, dismemberment, death? What hope can you have in a world where there is no escape - there is no free travel, and nowhere to flee to since all governments are the same? You cannot even take the step of ending your own life, as the government which cannot supply the country with enough food, shoes, or clothes also fails to supply its citizenry with razor blades.""1984"" paints a picture bleak and terrifying, of a government that terrorizes its populace into quiescence, and of a populace that is too fearful, too hungry, and too uneducated to attempt the mass uprising that might save them. In a world where children are taught to spy on their parents and turn them into the police for the most minor (or imagined) of crimes, there can be no love, no one worth fighting for or protecting. How does it all end? Orwell doesn't believe that it can end - ""1984"" is a reminder for eternal vigilance against an impossible enemy: ourselves. ~ Ana Mardoll"
1890,Kristin,"I just re-read this book and was horrified by how directly applicable it is to things happening in the US in 2012, particularly the GOP's War on Women as a tactic to repress sexuality on the whole. Orwell is a genius. This book is undeniably great. I support its reputation as a modern classic, and encourage everyone to read it, and read it soon! It will widen your perspective, expand your thoughts, and alter the way you look at the world, our governments, and our own human nature. A splash of metaphysics, centering around the question of ""what is reality?"" is probably the toughest concept included. And don't skip the appendix! I adored the concept and structure of Newspeak as a language and as an instrument of mind control. The only thing I was slightly disappointed with was [SPOILER] how Julia, such a fireball to begin with, settled into complacency once she & Wilson achieved their initial act of disobedience. If she's done this ""hundreds of times... well, dozens at least,"" why is she so content to stay in one place with him?"
1891,forough,به نظرم این کتاب اوج بلوغ فکری یک نویسنده رو میرسونه... 
1892,いんたねっと,"1. I decided to read this book because the teacher of my before-school english class instructed the class to as part of our dystopian literature topic. I had only read one other book by Orwell, ""Animal Farm"", and enjoyed it greatly and so decided to give this one a try.2. This book completes the ""Classics written before 1950"" category, as it was written in 1949. This category interests me because these books have been accessible and loved by generations, and are still well known today. A book that has survived for 64 years is undoubtably an excellent read.3. An idea in this book that I found very powerful was the idea of a society controlled by the government, to the point of loss of any sense of autonomy and free will. In this book the protagonist, Winston Smith, is forced to suffer through intense government surveillance and control. Society is built on a wealth of lies and systematic destruction of anything that might incite suspicion of the government, including humans. He then rebels, acting in secret to preserve his humanity and love for Julia, and is resultantly brainwashed through a combination of physical and psychological torture. I found this book, and especially the second half, immensely emotionally powerful and chilling, and was left in a state of shocked catatonia by the end of the last page.4. A quote I found particularly moving was the quote ""HE WHO CONTROLS THE PAST, CONTROLS THE PRESENT"". This was one of the slogans of a group called the Party, and refers to their means of altering records of past events in order to maintain their dignity and upstanding among the community. But in a way, its true. Altering the records of the Parties actions to convey them in a better light, does actually make them seem bigger and more important, and that's why very few people (as it seems to be, only truly Winston and Julia), find it in themselves to question the system they live under. And even they, too, get brainwashed in the end. 5. Something I learned from this book is conformity is often destruction. Falling into the lines of what society expects of you, regardless of your own wishes, is the ultimate barbaric way of power and control over the masses. Although this is an exaggerated example, governments can influence people in ways we don't realise, and we need to have the sense to rebel when necessary and do our best to understand the reasoning. We all must work to provide a society not run on social expectations and oppression, but on our own free will and humanity."
1893,Vickie ,"Oddly enough, this book was boring when i was a kid, but a bit scary now that I'm an adult."
1894,Bill,"George Orwell is indisputably the greatest didactic writer in the English language since Samuel Johnson. As an essayist, he is a nonpareil, and his insights — which he modestly characterized as ""a power of facing unpleasant facts"" — are remarkable, original, and biting. The scintillating force of his pen shines most brightly in his essays and his memoirs.The very power of his personal prose that gives such force to his essays and memoirs, however, leaves his fiction curiously flat. For all his insight, he seems to lack the ability to free his characters to lead independent fictional lives. A person reading Orwell's novels for their characterization would shoot himself.Such is the force, clarity, and originality of Orwell's ideas, however, and the freshness of his candor, that it is easy to forgive the flat characterization and intrusive narration of the novels. And while each generation seems to find some pundit who dismisses Orwell's dark vision in 1984 as passe, fresh revelations of the octopus-like stranglehold of the National Security Agency over the daily minutiae of the the lives of 300 million Americans gives proof daily of how prescient Orwell was. Big Brother is indeed watching."
1895,Lena,"Я думаю, об этом романе (и по этому роману) в принципе очень много сказано, написано, спето и пр.. Писать мне что-либо – полная глупость и трата моего времени и надежд на то, что я-таки напишу что-нибудь поистине Потрясающее о ней. Но именно Потрясающий отзыв о ней и хочется написать. Эта книга здорово изменила и дополнила мое мировоззрение. Она заставила меня больше думать по жизни. Она показала мне, как можно влиять на меня и как я могу защититься от влияния на меня. И я очень переосмыслила многие факты истории, которые знала… В общем, книга потрясающая. Я ее читала на английском и на русском, перечитывала частями и была всякий раз поражена… Но. Если вы очень впечатлительный человек, подумайте, прежде чем читать. Этот шедевр расширяет границы мышления, если его анализировать и сравнивать с нашей обычной жизнью, но первое время после прочтения периодические острые приступы паранойи обеспечены. Но не бойтесь, это проходит! Потом приступы будут реже и не такие острые… ;)Словом, рекомендую."
1896,Antonio,"Para mi, redactar una reseña de ésta obra es muy difícil, debido a la complejidad del libro. los temas que se manejan son bastante complejos, Orwell definitivamente realiza una critica a los distintos sistemas de gobierno que perduran en el mundo, mostrándonos que cualquier tipo de gobierno tiene un toque de Oceanía. La frase que mejor describe el tema del libro es la misma que Orwell menciona al inicio y en la mayoría de la novela.La guerra es la pazLa libertad es la esclavitud La ignorancia es la fuerza "
1897,Wael Hamza,ربما كان من نافلة القول ان اكرر عظمة هذه الرواية، وربما كان أيضا من المكرر ان اشير الى وجه التشابه التام فيما يفعله الاخ الاكبر في الرواية و ما يقدم عليه الطغاه،ولن اقدم على ان امدح و اشرح و احلل الرواية ولكن هناك موقف بسيط جدا في الرواية استرعى انتباهي هو موقف ونستون و الجرذان ، حينما. توسل اليهم ان يفعلوا ذلك بجوليا و ليس به ، حينما مر بي هذا المشهد قفز الى ذاكرتي مشهد اخر مشابه في الظروف مختلف في النتيجة يوضح الفرق بين من يرجو لقاء الله و من لا يرجو لقاءه انه مشهد استعداد الصحابي خبيب بن عدي الانصاري للقتل حينما خاطبه المشركون قائلين  أفتحب أن محمدًا في مكانك وأنت جالس في بيتك؟ قال: لا والله، ما أحب أن يُشاك محمد بشوكة وأنا جالس في بيتي **********انه المشهد الذي لا يكسر النفس انها النتيجة التي تسمو على باقي النتائج ، انها صدق العزم ، صدق الرجاء ، و صدق المحبة *********فهذا الصدق هو ما سيكسر الطغيان 
1898,Antonis,"Orwell's longstanding monument of English Literature in the 20th century is an impossibility. It is didactic, albeit through negative example. It is moralistic. It is a novel of ideas rather than characters. It never once abandons an idea, never second-guesses itself, never once makes concessions to some other side of an argument. It is out to make a very pointed point, and that point is a period ending a straightforward and intelligible sentence, the kind Orwell enjoys and employs:Be free and speak the truth.And yet! Somehow this marvel of an essay-turned-novel is lauded even now by the intelligentsia of the post-post-modern world. The kind that despise wisdom or truth. The kind that spit on ideas if they, not characters, become the focus of a work. The kind that love to contort and twist the English language in such a way as to make every point a not-point, an unpoint if you will, so that no ideas can be spoken without trepidation or fear of the subjectivist thought police.How in the nine hells did this novel survive in our time. Perhaps the academics never actually read it. Perhaps they thought the little snippets they had read – about reality being a conjuring of the mind, the dissolution of reality into solipsistic playfulness – were not mantras of the Party in creating Doublethink! That is one explanation, though doubtless it is more complex than that.I want to talk about a few things here that are not concerned with any of this, however. I want to talk about the Three Superpowers. I want to talk about Oceania. In a weird way, I want to talk about Plato's Republic and how it may have anticipated Orwell. I want to talk about why 1984 is terrifying. And to do so, we have to tackle what essential elements this dystopia is made of. Namely:Statism/SocialismThought controlThese are the elements that define Oceania in the year of [is it?] 1984.STATISM/SOCIALISM“Wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly. The so-called ‘abolition of private property’ which took place in the middle years of the century meant, in effect, the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before: but with this difference, that the new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals.”So details Emmanuel Goldstein, if he ever existed, in his tract-within-a-novel, “The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism” which functions as the foil of the Party. The point is clear as crystal. The means of wealth creation, and the end of wealth itself, have become fully socialized in 1984. Necessarily they were used not to the betterment of individuals, but to the continued existence of the State, which I will get to shortly. This is an unavoidable mainstay of Socialism, and the central tenant of Communism, that “no member of the Party owns anything except petty personal belongings.” This is the stated end toward which Socialism moves, to shift production toward central distribution and to let its people fuss over baubles.It should be noted that the society of 1984 is achieved through a Party, not a Business, nor a Corporation, nor a Market, free or otherwise. In fact, free markets are alluded to quite positively in the book as remnants of a bygone age before the Revolution. This is a crucial distinction. Only through a political artifice could such a hell ascend. Orwell was no slouch – he meant to elucidate through word choice, and no word could be more apt for a totalitarian monstrosity than Party. By this, members are made obsolete. By this, the individual is unimportant. By this, any manner of evil can be performed because no single one performs it. The onus lies on the Party, and the Party is supreme.But wait, wasn't Orwell a Socialist? Indeed he was. But he was also a great thinker and a man wholly committed to being consistent and truthful; by no means could he abide a Maoist or Stalinist state, no matter how faithful or unfaithful they were to the stated aims of the Bolsheviks. So if he is a Socialist, he is one with no teeth. Because by no means can a commune propagate except by the freedoms inherent to a freed market, by which people can freely associate and pool resources. By then, it is no longer Socialism, but a voluntary agora. If you want true abolition of private property everywhere equally, you must do so by the barrel of a gun, or more aptly the heel of a boot stomping in a face – forever. So in a sense I too am a socialist like Orwell; I desire equality of the classes, I want to uplift the poor, I want to dismantle the rich, I want to give charitably and love others. But those can just as easily come about through a Capitalist mode, and I would argue can only come about fairly, justly, and realistically through that same mode.THOUGHT CONTROLThere is something interesting going on in 1984 concerning time and memory. I'm still not sure exactly what that is, though. The control of the future through the past, and the past through the present, is inextricably tied up to the memories of Outer Party members and the time in which their memories are set. Do we even know what time 1984 is set in? Not even our lens character, Winston, is able to recall if 1984 is the correct year. This is the novel's brilliance; even its title is an act of Doublethink.Really, I've gone on long enough for a little review on Goodreads, but I will resume this line of thought at a later time."
1899,Khaalidah Muhammad-Ali,"I read this a long time ago and when I am bookless I often load it to my iPod and listen to it. I love this book and get ""something"" different each time I read it. Its smart and daring and frightening and the messages carry through the decades."
1900,Tereza,Stunned. How smart that guy (I mean Orwell) must have been...
1901,Zulma Rios,"Cuando estaba leyendo este libro no podía dejar de pensar que la sociedad actual esta caminando, hacia un futuro muy parecido al que narra este libro.Personas vigiladas las 24 horas del día, como siempre no quiero hacer spoilers para que ustedes mismos descubran lo emocionante de este libro. Pero en el se encuentra mucha similitud con lo que vivimos actualmente.La frase por la que el libro puede ser conocida es “El Gran Hermano te Vigila”. La historia del libro gira en torno de una sociedad controlada en la que se intenta eliminar los sentimientos excepto el “odio” este se promueve se provoca se debe odiar a todo aquello que va en contra del partido, así también se promueve el amor hacia el partido. existe el crimen de pensamiento conocido como “crimental” en el que te castigan por haber pensado en contra de la sociedad y en el que cualquiera te delataría incluso tus propios hijos.Reseña ampliada en: http://historiasdepaginas.blogspot.mx..."
1902,Taylor,"It's clear why this is such a monumental work of literature and on every sci fi list out there as a must read. I would recommend not watching Citizen Four in conjuncture with this; just because you're paranoid doesn't mean some one is not out to get you. It can't be helped but to look at this story with an eye that has been raised on the the influence of the book, even though the actual content of the book was unknown to me. But it's unbelievably spine-chilling the similarities between the dogma of EngSoc (English Socialism) and today's American bi-partisan party system with a heavy influence of capitalism. Actually, the capitalism portion of 1984 was really the only part where Orwell seemed to miss the mark. EngSoc doesn't run on Capitalism. In fact, the idea is villainized. Industry continues, but it's based more on a need for monotonous production rather than an economic need. The citizens of Oceania still go hungry, wear uniforms for everyday life, and nearly half the population is without shoes, yet reports of surpassed production keep being published. Perhaps it's because the United States has no memory of war time ravaging our daily lives that I find this oversight so erogenous, but whatever. Perhaps Capitalism really didn't look like it would survive and flourish during the early 1940's when this book was written. The constant presence of Big Brother and the forced propaganda feels relatable now more than ever. With the ever threat of terrorism (war is peace) and the willingness of citizens to forfeit their freedom of privacy to ensure their safety (freedom is slavery), it's upsetting to see so many comparisons between this book and reality. But that's not what a review is about. A review is to critique the work as a piece, and this is certainly a piece of work. Orwell is a master at folding his desired message he wants to broadcast into an engaging tale. Much like Animal Farm, 1984 allows the characters and events tell the story rather than the protagonist. Perhaps save for 'The Book', however it seems The Book's purpose is to clarify the subtle points the reader might have missed, which isn't really a problem with today's audience, as the pure essence of 1984 has been woven into so much of our existing media. All in all, this book is a must read. I would have blown through it if I had been actually reading the text. As it was, this was an audiobook, and for the life of me I could not stay awake when the narrator was reading. Seriously; middle of the afternoon and the next thing I know I fell asleep and missed a huge chunk of it and had to keep skipping back to find the last remembered spot. This is a must read, and I imagine I'll pick it up again in good time. "
1903,Ron,"Ultimately, I remember a book for how it makes me feel. 1984 brought out so much emotion. I cannot forget it.At times terrifying. At times heartbreaking. 1984 is an amazing book. Terrifying because of the world that Winston loves in, a time in the future where Big Brother may be watching or listening to your every move. It is a place where life is fear. There is no outside world, no history, and a child may turn you in as a traitor. Heartbreaking because Winston is so alone in this world. Even surrounded by other people, I feel that he is alone, different. When he does make a connection with another like himself (I will abstain details here to avoid a spoiler), there is the impending feeling that it cannot last long. They will be found out in this place where there is no freedom, and it will be smashed to pieces.I see 1984 as a precursor to so many of the dystopian, apocalyptic style novels that have followed in its footsteps, even to this day. It may not have been the first, but I find it to be the best of them. One blogger I read said that 1984 was not the best written of the classic dystopian novels. I disagree. It may not have the poetic verse of Fahrenheit 451, but it has intense prose. It’s a book I will come back to reread because I found parts of it to be deep and complicated, especially the last half. So much so that I was often backtracking as I read.1984’s dystopian future felt more real to me on a personal level, than today’s books of plagues, zombies and survival games. The book may be partial satire, but it was set in a reality of sorts. George Orwell experienced the World Wars, Nazism, Communism, Socialism and poverty. All of that comes through while at the same time giving us a main character we connect to, and a world we want to fight against. In short, the book has a point to make. It has a reason.The last quarter of the book crushed me with emotion. I applauded Winston for trying to hold on, and then I wanted to reach in and save him of his fate. Simply one of the best books I’ve ever read."

1905,Jade,"“We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.” Definitely one of my favourite books of all time. A novel that needs to be read by everyone, whether you end up liking it, loving it or hating it. Experience it. "
1906,Sarah Hoang,"This book was intensely brilliant. I admit that in the beginning it starts out a little sluggish, but that's only because the author was ""setting the stage"". Things started to happen more in part 2, which was slightly disappointing. There wasn't much action, it was more like reading an essay in fact. There's one thing that I wanted more of, and that was dialogue. I agree that this book is very intriguing mostly from start to finish. The author shows every aspect of this dystopian society. I believe his use of language creates a more powerful effect with emotional appeal. I love that this book does make you question our aspects of life. It's a real eye opener. This book is absolutely my top favorites. Endings like this are hard to forget. "
1907,Alessandra Santamaria,"*re-read in 2016*in a way, it was even better the second time. it was much easier to understand, and less depressing. i love it just as much as i see things more clearly now.*2014*I dont think i have proper words to describe the book. It kind of reminds me a little bit of ""clockwork orange"", because even though it is not a pretty book, it makes you think, judge society and people around you, question the things you think are true. You want to be different, you want to BE the difference.This book is just amazing. That's the only way i can put it. So interesting, revealing, scary and realistic all at the same time. It's like it's said in the book ""the best books are the ones that tell us the things we already know"", but we simply dont have the intelligence or concentration, or creativity tu put in words. George Orwell acomplished something that i never though could happen, He made me see politics in a interesting and passionate way. Every single phrase of this novel has so much meaning and sense, it makes me mad.Besides being a political book, i also see a lot of physicology and horror in it. Not what i am used to, but i find it an amazing combination.Probably not a book for everyone, but if you have the level of maturity necessary and you CARE about LIFE, SOCIETY AND JUSTICE enough, you HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK"

1909,Nicola Dorrington,"Admittedly I've read 1984 before, many times in fact. But seeing as I've just given it another read, I figure I might as well add it on GoodReads.I don't really need to say much about this book. After having read a lot of supposedly dystopian books over the last few years, George Orwell reminds me what a true dystopian should be. Hopeless. Because that's the ultimate feeling of this book. Forget a rebellion led by a beautiful, passionate young adult who frees everyone from tyranny over the course of three books, this is true dystopian where at the end you, and the main character, realise that there is no hope. It is impossible to overthrow a government that controls everything. That is willing to go to any means to hold onto power.But that said, I will say that 1984 isn't really a novel in many ways. It's an essay about the dangers of big, powerful government, on either side of the political spectrum. What's often fascinates me about this book is that despite when it was written, so much of it still rings true even today. "
1910,Yogi Saputro,"(Resensi berasal dari blog saya: Resensi 1984)Penantian saya untuk membaca buku ini akhirnya kesampaian juga. Sudah dua tahun lebih saya mencari buku ini (karena selalu ada di puncak listopia Goodreads). Awalnya saya kira cuma ada versi Bahasa Inggris. Kemudian ketika keluar cetakan baru dari Penerbit Bentang, saya langsung berburu dan akhirnya dapat.Rada basa-basi nih, tapi saya merasa harus berterima kasih disertai rasa kagum terhadap Landung Simatupang sang penerjemah novel ini. 1984 sama sekali bukan karya dengan bahasa gampangan. Bahkan di dalamnya terdapat kosakata baru sebagai bagian dari cerita. Namun beliau mampu menuliskannya ke dalam bahasa Indonesia tanpa mengurangi makna utuhnya. Sungguh hebat saya rasa. Walaupun beberapa kata menjadi lucu juga karena diterjemahkan. Misalnya Ministry of Plenty menjadi Kementrian Tumpah Ruah.Mengenai isi novel ini saya pun angkat topi. Poster bertuliskan BUNG BESAR MENGAWASI ANDA itu terasa menjadi pembuka tabir atas latar dunia di novel ini. Kondisi distopia dimana Partai manguasai negeri secara penuh. Rakyat diawasi dan dikontrol hingga sedetail-detailnya. Hukuman untuk pembangkang adalah diuapkan. Untuk melanggengkan kekuasaannya, Partai memberikan tiga prinsip:Perang ialah DamaiKebebasan ialah PerbudakanKebodohan ialah KekuatanDi dalam sistem yang ketat itu muncul seorang bernama Winston. Dia anggota Partai yang merasakan ketidakpuasan atas kekejian dan kepalsuan yang terjadi. Pemuja sekaligus pembenci Partai. Orang yang berpotensi menggulingkan kekuasaan totaliter Partai. Dia menjalin kisah cinta (yang tentunya ilegal menurut Partai) dengan gadis bernama Julia. Bersama mereka memupuk kebencian terhadap Partai secara sembunyi-sembunyi. Sampai suatu ketika sesuatu dahsyat terjadi...Saya hampir tidak percaya buku ini ditulis pada tahun 1949. Seolah-olah novel ini pada masa itu merupakan ramalan dunia masa depan pasca Perang Dunia II. Deskripsinya begitu nyata, merasuk ke dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Perasaan terawasi oleh teleskrin, sulitnya suplai pisau cukur sementara berita mengatakan surplus, ketakutan dilaporkan menyimpang oleh anak sendiri, tuntutan pekerjaan pemalsuan di Partai, makan siang di kantin berkarat, dan sebagainya. Penceritaannya begitu mengagumkan sampai-sampai beberapa orang khawatir kalau itu sungguh terjadi pada masa mendatang. Yah, walaupun akhirnya kita tahu kondisi sekarang tidak sampai sedemikian.Sedikit spoiler, dalam novel ini Winston akan membaca sebuah ""kitab"" berisi dasar ideologi dunia distopia dalam novel ini. Bagian ini yang menurut saya penyambung paling kuat. Peletak teori politik baru yang cemerlang dari Orwell. Rasanya kalau iman tidak kuat, paham yang tertanam bisa menyimpang. Saya hampir yakin buku ini dibredel di zaman Soeharto. Alasannya dapat dimengerti kalau Anda sudah selesai baca buku ini. Pada akhirnya novel ini pun merupakan satir yang memotret kekerasan dalam pemerintahan dan perang yang terjadi pada dekade 40-an.Secara keseluruhan, novel ini memang layak disebut sebagai bacaan legendaris. Tulisan yang visioner, kritik sosial yang keras, alur cerita yang kuat, fitur-fitur unik dunia distopia, semua memadu menjadi buku yang layak dibaca sepanjang zaman. Bahkan ketika sudah lewat tahun 1984 sekalipun."

1912,Nick Adamson,"You could say that 1984 is essentially about the concept of freedom being the truth of what makes us human, and that coercive power is a denial of that truth of humanity. This supports Orwell's identification as an anarchist,but unfortunately so few people know enough about anarchism today to connect the dots. Like Newspeak appropriating the meaning of words, most people do not even know what Orwell was referring to when he claimed to be an anarchist. I've heard it said that people blow this novel out of proportion, comparing a parking ticket to Big Brother. The thing that's sad about the parking ticket analogy is not that these people react negatively to a small instance of coercive power, it's that their privilege, and the political language of capitalism blind them to the larger coercive power being thrust on them and the rest of the world daily. ""Freedom isn't free"" is not all that different from ""war is peace, freedom is slavery""."
1913,Katie,"In 1984, you have no privacy. Your life, thoughts, hobbies, and love are monitored by the government, Big Brother is always watching you. For most people living in this dystopian society it’s normal, they’re used to it, they even like it, but many others, like Winston, our main character, are against Big Brother and would gladly stop him at all costs. But rebellion is a dangerous thing, and the price of getting caught is your life… Classics are usually a hit or a miss with me. Generally, I like them, but there are some that I hate the moment I read the first chapter. Luckily, 1984 was not one of those books. It had a deep emotional writing style that conveyed more emotion than I was expecting. Usually the downfall for classics is that the plot is good, but the characters seem extremely static because they don’t really have any feelings or emotions. This was no problem in 1984, hatred, love, sorrow, and pain were all emotions that I felt clearly while reading. There were few pages that weren’t bursting with words that affected me deeply. The characters in this book changed, as well as Winston’s opinion of the characters. You could clearly tell what he thought of all of them before he even said anything. They were perfect, well-rounded, dynamic people who developed and changed throughout the novel. I could stay here and write about them each individually for hours, but I think I would end up spoiling the book.The plot was another thing that I loved about it. Given that it’s a classic, I thought that it would have some generic plot that I could easily predict because it’s been recreated a gazillion times. That was not the case.The plot had many twists and turns, every time I was positive that something would happen, Orwell proved me wrong. When I finally got to the point where I was reading it like it had just been written, not expecting anything unoriginal to happen, The biggest plot twist in the novel happened. It was something that I probably should have realized was going to happen, but I didn’t. I was shocked and just in utter disbelief that something like that would happen. Just read this book, honestly, it’s unlike any classic that I’ve ever read. I’ll definitely be reading more of George Orwell’s work after this. I was hooked by the first page and I couldn’t put it down. I should blame Orwell every time I get a bad grade on a test.“Well, you see, if George Orwell wasn’t such an amazing author, I wouldn’t have read 1984 instead of studying. So… it’s not my fault that I got this grade, right?”If only that was how it worked. Anyway, this book was impossible to put down. Especially when I got to part two. It moved fast but in a way that was easy to see and understand. I moved through all of part 2 on one day, and all of part three the next. It just went so fast and the novel was so carefully thought out that if just one thing had changed, the entire book would be different.Please read this book. I don’t care if you turn into a paranoid hobbit living alone, it is amazing and this book is totally worth it."
1914,Simon,The book that's had the profoundest effect on me in recent memory. Quite simply mindblowing.
1915,Bakhtiyar,A great mirror of our society.
1916,Peregrine 12,"The most disturbing thing I've ever read. I had nightmares after reading this book. I woke up terrified of losing everything I thought I loved - family, girlfriend, home, all of it. I know that sounds a little fake in today's 'everyone's tough/everybody's a badass' world, but it's true."
1917,Stacy Park,"A wonderful read made even more magnificent if you analyze the ending as the beginning. That is, perhaps Winston's capture and subsequent release back into society at the end of the novel has, in actuality, already occurred countless times before. In this way, the novel itself becomes an unending and systematic cycle of rebellion, capture, torture, release, and repeat. There are so many instances that allude to this analysis - a ""nostalgic"" adjective dropped here and there, a ""familiarity"" of a particular scene, etc. Winston's inability to escape this cycle and the grip of immortal Big Brother truly makes the work itself a brilliant manifestation of a complete and totalized form of power."
1918,Andreea,"Anumite aspecte ale acestui roman se gasesc si in Ferma Animalelor, insa intr-o forma mai simpla, 1984 fiind vadit mai complex si mai impresionant din punct de vedere conceptual.1984 este deci tot un roman distopic, cu acceptie politica, scris in 1948 si publicat in 1949. Este destul greu de descris si de explicat, de aceea recomand sa il cititi integral. De preferat ar fi sa aveti si cateva cunostinte despre socialism si totalitarism pentru a-l putea intelege pe deplin.Ca o scurta prezentare a continutului, pot sa spun ca actiunea se petrece, teoretic, in anul 1984. Teoretic deoarece, datorita opresiunii, nici locuitorii Londrei din aceasta perioada nu pot spune cu exactitate anul in care se afla.Romanul are cateva concepte dominante, cum ar fi Fratele cel Mare, dublu ganditul, Politia Gandului, Soceng.Dupa o presupusa revolutie din anii '50, lumea era acum impartita in 3 superputeri aflate in razboi: Oceania, Eurasia si Estasia. Taberele erau mereu schimbatoare, dupa cum era mai bine pentru Partid. Lucru care te face sa pui la indoiala chiar si existenta acestui razboi. Ambientul este reprezentat de Londra, principalul oras din Oceania.Fratele cel Mare (Big Brother in original) a devenit o figura metaforica a regimurilor totalitare, datorita semnificatiei sale de perchezitie permanenta. Sloganul ""Fratele cel Mare sta cu ochii pe tine"" (Big Brother is watching you) este extrem de des-intalnit pe parcursul romanului prin intermediul afiselor cu chipul unui barbat (caracterizat de trasaturi aspre, ochi negri patrunzatori, aproape hipnotizanti) raspandite in tot orasul, pe edificiile oficiale, cladiri, sau in interiorul blocurilor. Reprezinta deci o imagine aproape obsedanta, care te urmareste la tot pasul si de ochii caruia nu poti scapa nicaieri.Sloganul Fratelui cel Mare este reprezentat exact de opusul valorilor noastre:"" Razboiul este paceLibertatea este sclavieIgnoranta este putere ""Edificiile oficiale sunt reprezentate de patru ministere. Dau impresia prin sugestivitatea numelor ca principala lor ocupatie ar fi asigurarea bunastarii poporului, insa este total opusul:- Ministerul Pacii se ocupa de tot ce are legatura cu razboiul;- Ministerul Adevarului era responsabil de falsificarea trecutului, a presei, a oricaror dovezi care ar putea contrazice declaratiile Partidului; de remarcat ar fi o alta doctrina a Partidului care sustine ca ""Cine controleaza trecutul controleaza viitorul. Cine controleaza prezentul controleaza trecutul"".- Ministerul Iubirii era cel care se ocupa si de Politia Gandirii, o formatiune care ii tortura fizic si/sau psihic pe cei care comisesera diverse crime (reale sau imaginare), ii omora sau, in multe cazuri, ii vaporiza (orice urma a existentei lor era stearsa).- Ministerul Abundentei era cel care rationaliza toate bunurile (mancarea, tigarile, alcoolul, pana la sireturi si lame de barbierit).Populatia Londrei era reprezentata in proportie de 85% de proli (proletari), considerati niste animale si deci nedemni de luat in calcul, restul fiind membrii ai Partidului Intern sau Extern. Membrii Partidului Intern erau, evident, privilegiatii, iar cei ai Partidului Extern erau victimele opresiei la cel mai inalt nivel. In casele lor se gaseau tele-ecranele, niste dispozitive care transmiteau si receptau in acelasi timp. Desi puteai da sonorul mai incet, nu puteai niciodata sa-l inchizi de tot. Cat timp te aflai in raza vizuala a acestui tele-ecran, erai supravegheat in permanenta si numai dupa ora 23.30, cand se stingeau luminile si orasul era invaluit de intuneric puteai fi cu adevarat singur.O alta modalitate de control si de opresie era Politia Gandirii, care la orice act excentric sau cat de putin suspicios putea sa te aresteze. Teoretic, in mod oficial, nu exista nicio lege care sa te impiedice sa faci ceva. Practic, prin orice act catusi de putin neobisnuit Politia Gandirii te putea vaporiza.Partidul inocula, deasemenea, un anumit tip de gandire copiilor. Desi sustinea ca incurajeaza familia si afectiunea in cadrul acesteia, la scoala erau instruiti sa-si iubeasca Partidul si sa spioneze continuu membrii familiei, din dragoste pentru Partid, ca mai apoi sa-i denunte Politiei Gandirii pentru infractiuni, sub acest pretext. Partidul ii impinge, deci, sistematic, sa-si tradeze propria familie.Infractiunile erau numite, in mod general, crimagandit. Cuvantul provine dintr-o limba fictiva creata de Orwell pentru acest roman, novlimba sau nouvorba.Aceasta limba, pentru un mai bun control al mintii, isi propunea sa elimine toate cuvintele considerate periculoase pentru Partid, adica toate cele care aveau un sens dublu care implicau un inteles politic. Limba veche era astfel curatata de orice notiuni nedorite pentru a nu lasa oamenii sa poata exprima si cea mai mica critica la adresa Partidului deoarece, pur si simplu nu ar fi existat termeni pe care sa ii foloseasca. Cea mai buna explicatie a novlimbii a fost data in roman de un personaj secundar, Syme:„Nu vezi frumuse?ea desfiin?arii cuvintelor? Tu nu ?tiai ca Nouvorba este singura limba din lume al carei vocabular scade în fiecare an?! […] Nu în?elegi ca singurul scop al Nouvorbei este de a limita aria de gândire?! Pâna la sfâr?it, o sa facem crimagânditul literalmente imposibil, pentru ca n-or sa mai existe cuvinte în care sa-l exprimi. Fiecare concept care ar putea fi necesar vreodata ori?icui va fi exprimat printr-un singur cuvânt, cu sens strict definit ?i cu toate celelalte sensuri secundare ?terse ?i uitate. Cum crezi tu c-ai mai putea avea o lozinca 'Libertatea este sclavie', când însu?i conceptul de libertate va fi abolit?”Personajele principale ale acestui roman sunt Winston Smith si Julia, care se lupta pentru a pastra un gram de umanitate in aceasta societate plina de opresie si restrictii nescrise, dar care sunt totusi grav pedepsite. Diferenta dintre ei este ca desi Julia este constienta de minciunile Partidului, este total indiferenta acestora deoarece nu ii pasa de generatiile ce vor urma. Winston in schimb percepe altfel falsificarile puse la cale de Partid, viata mizerabila si opresia, dar nu poate face nimic pentru a le opri. Datorita epurarilor din anii '50-'60 (toate persoanele adulte din acea perioada au fost vaporizate pentru a taia orice ar fi putut face legatura dintre prezent si trecut) nimeni nu stia sa spuna daca viata era mai buna atunci, deoarece neexistand un alt mijloc de comparatie nu puteai sustine nimic.Finalul este deosebit de socant, si anihileaza orice urma de speranta ar fi fost ramasa pentru aceasta societate oprimanta.Oamenii sunt desfiintati psihic, spalati pe creier, iar Partidul este unicul castigator.Este unul dintre putinele romane cu adevarat impresionante pe care le-am citit. Are un efect mindfucking, si trebuie analizat in profunzime pentru a-l intelege complet. "

1920,John Morgan,"You read this book, and you think to yourself ""Holy crud, this guy has a time machine"". One reason you will think this is because the author, George Orwell, wrote this book in the late 1940's. He basically shows life in the future from his present time. This is a book about obedience, and complete control, as the story is about a man living in a world with no privacy. The government controls everything you do, see, and feel. With cameras covering the whole city, you have no freedom. It is really a book similar to Anthem, but 10 times better, and with that classical literature everyone loves. The book's story is about a man, who decides that he doesn't want to feel controlled. He starts disobeying the law, and does something that nobody in his time has really felt. Love. Yes ladies and gentlemen, a story of how feelings never felt before can change your whole life, and lead you to do something insane. What's really interestng about this book is how George Orwell describes the politics so vividly in the books presentThere are only 3 different ""superstates"" now, due to an atomic mishap.Since then, All three are at war with eachother. With war on the loose, and the government trying to keep control of all its people, they came up with someone to watch over them. Big Brother. You may have heard of this many times, ""Big Brother is watching you"".This is where it came from. Unfortunaltely, I have said too much.Read this book. Understand how the government can turn against you, and can take advantage of their power. READ IT."
1921,Tonia Graves,Took me a while to read but I'm glad I stuck with it. A chilling and sinister story; the feelings of hope and enlightenment in the first half of the book give way to horror and brutality followed in the end by inevitable surrender to Big Brother. How many people in the world today are living under regimes like this one?
1922,Farnoosh Brock,"The most terrifying, frightening, horrifying book of all time: The Thought PoliceI have now read the most terrifying, frightening, horrifying book of all time, a chilling prophecy of a future that is both impossible not to read once you start, and hard to keep going in a lot of place. I LOVED 1984 by George Orwell. I now know that there is nothing that Stephen King or anyone else can tell that can ever arouse in me the fear, the shudder, the horrors of The Thought Police and Big Brother and the unforgettably disturbing O'Brien character.I never read this book in high school, so when it showed up on Kindle Unlimited, I snatched it - lucky for me, the audio came along with it. Double the horror, the terror, the fright. First, I begin by saying that I find it mildly ironic that in 1984, I lived in a place that was a figment of Orwell's predictions, in the Islamic Revolution of Iran, and while reading this difficult-to-digest masterpiece, the memories that I was certain I had long forgotten only came back into clear view. Winston was not a character you fell in love with or madly cared about, but he was an unfortunate victim of a mad world running on mad logic, mad government and mad laws. It was madness, I kept thinking as did Winston Smith, how can they do this? And yet they did. The bleak dark dismal world that George Orwell painted will remain intact in my mind for eternity, because it touched on the thing I fear the most - and that is something you do not forget easily.The writing is exquisite, superb, thunderous to the beating heart of the reader which has already slowed down a good amount. The story telling is so powerful that sometimes you just draw yourself out of the plot and just listen with joy - did I mention I was listening to it mostly? - listen to the art of writing, the perfection in the craft. If only the story were less dismal, less bleak, more tolerable, and I admit I almost put it down, I almost couldn't take it when they were discovered and then I thought, I owe it to George Orwell, I owe it to him to finish what he set out to tell us, and I will not stop until the very last words.Someone commented that she hated Julia. I found this intriguing. I do put down books when I hate the main character or even a major secondary character but 1984 was different. I did not read this book to love or hate any character, - there were no heroes here, and although I hated quite a few, I don't think love for the characters was the emotion that came to mind. Connecting with them and feeling their pain more than anything was my reason for staying with them to the end.I have to admit there is one section I did not like - and could not appreciate - and that was Goldstein's manuscript. It was necessary to the story, it was important to Orwell to write that I am sure, but it took away from the story and the plot both, and it was deeply complex - I was glad when Winston put the book down and the story continued .... but as I write this, I realize that not being able to appreciate this part of the book makes me more like Julia's character, and I wish Julia cared more about the manuscript too. But then again, what difference would it have made? None whatsoever.A recent book I finished, which had another most chilling effect on me from a dystopian future was Margaret Atwood's A Handmaid's Tale, and I can see so many parallels between the two and after looking it up, I'm not at all surprised that Atwood was indeed influenced by 1984 to write the story of the Republic of Gilead, a state ruled by religious fundamentalists. So if you enjoyed Orwell's 1984 - yes I do realize ""enjoy"" may not be the appropriate word, ooooh I wonder what the Newspeak term for it would be !!! - anyway if you appreciated Orwell's work, you will appreciate A Handmaid's Tale.Next for me, Animal Farm. I don't expect an upbeat story in that one either. Oh well, it shall be so as it must be done. Hope this review helps you decide whether to read or move on from the book. And on top of that, appreciate the fact that you indeed do have the freedom to CHOOSE, a priceless gift that you would miss sorely if it were stripped from you by the Thought Police. Just sayin'."
1923,Anand Khoje,"I just want to honestly say that I feel like I should learn this book by heart. Consume it. And remember every bit of it, till the end of my days. Having read already twice, I still feel the need to read it again and again. I don't know if it's normal, but I don't care."

Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system.
1984 is an enigma containing countless more enigmas. At the middle of the novel I was convinced that I knew what was happening and I was enjoying it quite a lot. Then suddenly at the ending of Part 2 something unexpected happened. And the whole of Part 3 was just a confusing and puzzling mess. Everything that I thought I knew and all the development that the characters went through backfired. As the novel progressed I learned more and more about O'Brien, but in the end I know absolutely nothing about him. I LOVE THE WRITING. Everything about it appeals to me. It is just wow.Nineteen Eighty-Four is pure genius and a mystery. It is . . . DOUBLEPLUSGOOD."

1931,Abhinav,"4.5 to 5 stars.Summary: Hidden away in the Record Department of the sprawling Ministry of Truth, Winston Smith skilfully rewrites the past to suit the needs of the Party. Yet he inwardly rebels against the totalitarian world he lives in, which demands absolute obedience and controls him through the all-seeing telescreens and the watchful eye of Big Brother, symbolic head of the Party. In his longing for truth and liberty, Smith begins a secret love affair with a fellow-worker Julia, but soon discovers the true price of freedom is betrayal.Written in 1948, 1984 was George Orwell's chilling prophecy about the future. And while the year 1984 has come and gone, Orwell's narrative is timelier than ever. 1984 presents a startling and haunting vision of the world, so powerful that it is completely convincing from start to finish. No one can deny the power of this novel, its hold on the imaginations of multiple generations of readers, or the resiliency of its admonitions. A legacy that seems only to grow with the passage of time.Review: I’ve read only two of George Orwell’s works – the other one being his memoir ‘Down and Out in Paris and London’. And he’s already one of my all-time favourite novelists. Orwell gives us a vivid picture of what ‘hell on earth’ would look like in this terrifying dystopian science fiction novel. The technologies described are synchronous with quite a number of the ones seen in today’s world and many words used in this novel have found their place in English vocabulary. ‘Nineteen Eighty-Four’ is a book that will remain a great work of modern literature for generations to come."
1932,Garrett Peters,"It is eerie how many similarities there are between the reality of Oceania, the totalitarian-surveillance state, and the United States. Driving this distress is the reality that, even though it is not as bad in the United States as it is in Oceania, this is probably only because the United States does not yet have the ability, because of technological or political reasons, to put its citizens under constant surveillance. Everything from Oceania’s ability to monitor everything someone is doing through technological means, to what Orwell references as a blue helicopter peering through citizen’s windows. Nowadays we have drones that could potentially do this if need be. In this world, the mere act of keeping a journal is seditious, punishable by death, or, at the very least, 25 years hard labor. And Winston Smith is as seditious a character as there has ever been written. I read this book long ago, in/for high school, I believe. I remembered the basic story line, and parts of it stuck with me all these years, such as the ending and having a major crush on Julia. But it wasn’t until I read it again that I appreciated just how interesting 1984 is as a story and how good a writer Orwell is. One thing I completely forgot from when I read 1984 the first time around was Smith’s reading parts of the book “The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism” by Emmanuel Goldstein. Smith taking us through the ideas laid out in that book is as fascinating at 1984 itself. "

1937,Nuno Ribeiro,"Big Brother. If this expression means reality show to you, you should read this book. It will not be the same as if you had read it before 1999. Actually, it might be even more interesting this way. Maybe this book was written for you. You know a Big Brother that is watching, day and night. You know that it talks from that place with no existance, authoritive and perverse. And you know people who want to be watched, who crave for that gaze. Maybe you have wondered what it is to be under that watchful stare. Well, you have a chance to know where it started. The irony, the poisonous sarcasm of the name. A Big Brother that watches over you. Not really a tirant. Not a bully. Not a god. A big brother. Now that you live in a world where everything (some even sugest, one day, our minds) can be uploaded and shared in a cloud, and many petabytes of information are filtered by those you should not be watching over us - they are not big brothers, just goverment -, be curious, and read about the dystopia imagined by George Orwell. Now that search engines, online, always try to be one step ahead of us, semantically smarter than us, so we don't have to think, learn about doublethink, and the issues raised in this book, decades ago. Think, read, feel."
1938,Oliver Eike,"By modern standards it is not a thrilling book and i would have given it a 4, but it is quite educational and it has a powerful message which earns it a 5 easily. It is a book one is served well by reading, however most people these days are not so naive as to think that there is no one watching you, not with the massive NSA scandal fresh in most peoples minds, but it underlines the importance of looking to our past and keep a damned close eye on those eager for power, and that is something that can never be stressed enough.

1940,♡Chloe♡,"This is a book that every living human needs to read. A powerful cry for freedom of thought an expression. This is a new favourite, love the way George Orwell writes, at some point in the future I will read 'Animal Farm'."
1941,Adrian,"'1984' was one of those books I've heard people praise all my life, but never read, probably because I never got around to it, but luckily I'm glad I didn't because I don't think I could have grasped the complexities at such a young age. I was a bit apprehensive to read '1984' because I had a luke warm reaction to 'Animal Farm' in the middle of last year, but both Orwell classics are day and night in gripping narrative, emotional sacrifice, and sympathetic characters. It's cliche to say that Orwell was ahead of his time with '1984' but it truly reads like a sci-fi paranoia action movie from the late 80s; not to mention that Orwell created a manifesto for a fictional governance with its own lexicon. If you're looking for a book that encompasses the themes of 'freedom' and 'paranoia', '1984' is the book to read. George Orwell orchestrates this dystopian world and the people that live in it with hair pin magnificence, and Winston Smith is his puppet for the dangers of thinking out of the legal status quo. '1984', more than anything, is a book about the underlying desires in a puritanical world, and out of all the comparisons this book has drawn to today's social climate it's this on that resonates. I was impressed at how complex these characters were, whether they were hiding behind rebellious facades or expressing disturbing feeling spurned by living under the restrictions of the fictional Oceania. Orwell didn't hold back when explaining Winston's violent disdain for women, because the party abolished sexual pleasure, except for procreation in selected marriage. It's these kind of ominous details that make '1984' groundbreaking, it's a no-holds-bar analysis on how society's affect on the social psyche. Accolades aside, I did have a few negative critiques about '1984', like Orwell's meticulous mapping out of the Brotherhood's manifesto. It went on way too long and was more on the tedious side to be considered interesting; it felt like an unnecessary intermission. And the interrogation part could have been edited down a bit, it became repetitious and belabored, almost like Orwell didn't know when to end it. All in all, '1984' is a fascinating read, and solidifies George Orwell as one of the most prolific writers in fiction, for his deep well of imagination and introspective style of writing; I'd call him the Nostradamus of English Literature. I hope you enjoy and revel in this book as much as I did."
1942,Taha," Tam bir ŞAHESER!!! ""Distopya""nın tanımı sorulduğunda, bu kitabı göstermek yeterli olacaktır sanırım :)(Ayrıntılı yorumum: http://1kitap5yorum.blogspot.com.tr/2... )"
1943,Carol Medina,"Definitivamente pasa a formar lista de mis favoritos, es un libro que a pesar de ser escrito en 1949, tiene mucho que dejar y es difícil creer que fue escrito en dicha época por el contenido del mismo, es inevitable no comprarlo con la realidad, te hace pensar, analizar. Es un libro triste, sombrío pero excelente.Es una historia que habla de una sociedad sin libertades civiles básicas y un gobierno con un control completo y sin respuesta, manipulador y de censura, no existe la libertad de pensamiento, expresión ni sentimiento, un mundo controlado por una minoría y que mantiene al resto de los seres humanos en una dictadura del ¨Gran hermano¨, que a través de unas pantallas dispuestas en cada rincón controla todo movimiento palabra que suponga un cuestionamiento del régimen establecido, una dictadura de pies a cabeza, con aires de democracia y justicia.Se puede decir que estamos viviendo lo que es el principio de una sociedad orwelliana? Una sociedad donde se manipula la información y se tiene represión social? Definitivamente es un libro que da origen a muchos debates y discusiones.Me encanto!!!"
1944,Brandon,"George Orwell's 1984 is perhaps one of the most interesting dystopian literature pieces I have read in a while. As a result of reading this work, I have shown great interest in doing more research on the topic that would include reading The Iron Heel (1907), We (1921), and others to form a comparison among the dystopias that have come my way. Prior to this, I have read Brave New World (1932) and then Plato's The Republic and Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward (1887), both acting as a counterbalance to what I know about dystopian societies.Nevertheless, 1984--as described in the afterword--serves as a warning to humanity of what we would become with our current systems intact. What one will find when reading 1984 is the Socialist vision failed as human suppression of truth and pleasure reign over Ingsoc, Eurasia, and Eastasia. Different names for their philosophies, but essentially the same system...one built up from the grounds of hatred and desire for power. This book truly shows how people are seeking power and will do anything for it even if it must come to destroying minds and continuously revising the past. In conclusion, free will is not present in this society. The only people to have free will is the Inner Party, who have been successful at keeping their positions intact. The people have no say other than to continuously hate an illusionary figure that may or may not exist and love Big Brother, which also may/may not exist. It is as they say--if they have control of the present, they control the past, which influences the future. If it is one lesson to be learned from this book, it is to make sure the desire for power or any other desire blinds humanity's conscious; otherwise, societies like this form, where certainty is gone altogether and only a present is existent. All else is gone, limited, or restrained by the other power in play."
1945,Austin,"The first time I read this book, it was required for High School. I skipped the ""book-within-a-book"" section, and skimmed the last few chapters. Then I watched the movie to fill in the gaps. The second time I read the book, I read it straight through, just out of High School, and I have to say that it scared the shit out of me for some reason. I ran with a lot of paranoid, drug-damaged kids, and the book was a little to close to what everyone I knew was actually talking about, which somehow made all that paranoia seem justified and ""true."" Since then, I've come to realize that, while great, it's actually a somewhat disappointing as a book. Orwell has written some good stuff, and there are sections of 1984 that are intense. But on the whole, it's ultimately unsatisfying, and knowing that the same man wrote Animal Farm makes me want more out of this book than is there. Still, it's well-worth the read. Every child should be forced to read it so they, too, can experience the effect of an institution forcing a piece of media on other people, and then get a little creeped out by how it all works. And I highly recommend getting the paranoid / government-out-to-get-me obsessions out of the way early on in High School, so that you can read other stuff later when you'll appreciate it more. "
1946,Fuad Takrouri,"**فالنهاية توجد في طيات البداية،ولكنها نهاية مخيفة ،أو بعبارة أدق،هي أشبه بتذوق مسبق لطعم الموت قبل أن يجيء ،وأشبه بكونك حياَ ولكن لا معنى لحياتك، **جريمة فكر..ويصبح الموت أمنية.أنت تأكل وتنام وتفكر كما يريدون،حتى أحلامك، تعابير وجهك،خلجات قلبك مراقبة- الأخ الأكبر يراقبك -من النادر ألا تعيش حالة الانسجام الكامل ،ويكون لديك ذلك الإحساس بالخوف  والرغبة المطلقة بالمتابعة حتى النهاية،وأن تكون مستعداً للهزيمة من قبل شرطة الفكروأن تنأى بعيداً بالحقيقة التي تطغي على العقل قبل أن تهزم في وزارة الحب.. بمعرفة كامل الرعب - لازدواجية الفكر- لدرجة الاختناق بكل أهوالها.الحرب هي السلاموالحرية هي العبوديةالجهل هو القوة**كيف يؤكد إنسان سلطته على إنسان آخر يا ونستون؟وقال ونستون بعد تفكير:""بجعله يقاسي الألم""**سميث:بالرغم من كل شيء**سنلتقي مكان حيث لا ظلمة فيه**يمكن أن يجد طريقة إلى الانقلاب على ذاته،ويمارس تلك الخيانة لكل ما يريد،حتى ولو كانت آخر عشر ثوان في حياته.. ويبحث عن الموت.أصر جورج اورويل على أن يكون مخلصاً...**إن الألم وحده لا يكون دائماً علاجاً كافياً،فهناك حالات يمكن للإنسان أن يحتمل الألم فيها ولو أدى ذلك إلى الموت،** "

1948,Jeff,"the neocons' template for gulag amerika: where war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength, the clock is striking 13, and toward which yeat's ""rough beast"" slouches--for the last 7 years, this book has day by day become more and more relevant, orwell more prescient--terry gilliam's brazil is the monty python version of 1984-- "
1949,Steve Peterson,"1984 was a very powerful book to me. I read it in my older years and would have liked to have read it when I was younger to see a difference in time of life and way of life (little tech to over abundance of tech). My review (spoilers below)(view spoiler)[The power of control over the population is a great risk as we begin to understand the needs of the people versus the party. The generic party has devised a system to control the population by watching everything they do. The power comes from the idea that they can see the persons thoughts by the ""thought police,"" thus manipulating the population into ""behaving"" as they party intents.
As we as a population become more connected with our ""smart devices"", the difficulty is now to live life knowing ""Big Brother"" is a real entity and is watching us and building patterns of control and marketing to control us.
In the end the brain control of the party wins Winston's love and adoration after all the torture and mind games... The party wins. I hope to provided a difficulty to most ""party"" antics and fight the powers to keep from being won over to the ""party"" and the thought police.

1950,Nahiyan Asadullah,"Absolutely stunning. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU!Basically what Orwell tries to convey here is the reality of any establishment. The Establishment simply wants to play make believe. If you want to have your own perspective of things, it simply won't have it. Think about the colonial establishment. What did the British do? They built their own schools and colleges in the colonies and created their curriculum. A curriculum which would teach the natives their own religion, but only to the extent where it wouldn't do any harm to the British interests. In English literature, we were taught Jeremy Bentham's 'Panopticon' theory. A Panopticon is basically an institutional building designed by the English social theorist in the late 18th century. The concept of the design is to allow a single watchman to observe (-opticon) all (pan-) inmates of an institution without the inmates being able to tell whether or not they are being watched. Although it is physically impossible for the single watchman to observe all cells at once, the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched means that all inmates must act as though they are watched at all times, effectively controlling their own behaviour constantly.Orwellian political Big Brother replicates the exact same idea. Your behavior is controlled, the moment you feel you're at large the Big Brother will immediately catch you in the act."
1951,Helena,This is going to stay with me for a long time...
1952,Tawfik Nabil,"really...really, got me thinking."
1953,Carmo Santos,"""Levaste pontapés, foste chicoteado e insultado, gritaste de dor, rebolaste no chão, em cima do teu próprio sangue e do vomitado. Choramingaste, imploraste misericórdia, traíste tudo e todos. Consegues imaginar uma única forma de degradação por que não tenhas passado?""Assim se verga a vontade, se aniquila o espírito e a tentativa de rebelião.1984 é o clássico das distopias e sem dúvida o melhor que já li neste segmento. George Orwell tinha uma imaginação brilhante - um tanto macabra, mas prodigiosa - só assim se explica que não se tenha esquecido de nenhum pormenor e tenha feito desta obra o maior exemplo duma sociedade totalitarista onde o cidadão não tinha voz, vontade ou autonomia. Sob o domínio permanente do Partido e do Grande Irmão eram vigiados dentro das suas próprias casas, todos os movimentos observados e analisados ao pormenor, recebendo informação adulterada, viviam sem passado, sem herança histórica ou cultural, sem se atreverem a sonhar ou ambicionar algo, num clima de permanente desconfiança onde o ódio era promovido gratuitamente. Viviam, executavam uma tarefa e morriam. Sós e com medo.Mas o regime ambicionava mais. Para um controlo total, havia que desagregar completamente a mente humana e molda-la à sua medida. Promovendo cada vez mais o medo e traição, até que nem entre familiares, nem entre cônjuges houvesse confiança. Suprimir as emoções, tornar o ato sexual um mero exercício reprodutor e acabar de vez com o contacto humano; passariam a seres autómatos e obedientes. A longo prazo a própria linguagem seria abolida e passariam a comunicar por grunhidos.""A posteridade jamais ouvirá falar de ti. Vamos suprimir-te totalmente do curso da história. Vamos transformar-te em gás e lançar-te na atmosfera. Nada restará de ti: nem nome num registo, nem qualquer recordação na memória dos vivos. Serás aniquilado, quer no passado, quer no futuro. Nunca terás existido. Uma antevisão apocalítica do futuro. No entanto, se pensarmos nalguns regimes que já grassaram por este mundo, e se pensarmos no que teria acontecido se não tivessem sido travados..."
1954,Paul Rance,"Winston Smith is one of literature's great heroes. O'Brien one of its great monsters. Okay, Smith is scared of rats, and suffers agonies of conscience and very real pain, but he takes on the state in his own small way. Big Brother is not someone to be worshipped. Hitler and Stalin gained power because people were slow to spot the danger, and there's Orwell's warning.Read more here, including an article by me on 1984's Central Character, Winston Smith.http://www.booksmusicfilmstv.com/Book..."
1955,Florence,"This is a great modern classic in which the principles of Newspeak are disclosed as the newly enforced communication in the year 1984. We read on only to feel despair about the future of man. We read about doubletalk...slavery is freedom, war is peace, etc. Such misleading jargon is being used today. People indeed are no longer ""saying the opposite of what they think, but think the opposite of what is true"". It makes the reader wonder whether human nature can really be altered through succesful manipulation of the mind."
1956,Ellen,This is genius.
1957,Nazim,"Winston Smith lives in a totalitarian society called ingSoc or English Socialism, which rules England. Every bit of literature except propagandistic one, science except military one, any traces of humanity and compassion are forbidden entirely. You cannot keep even a personal diary. Instead what you have to have is hatred against an enemy and nothing more. There’s a war between Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. This war is different for it is started not to achieve a victory over the enemy in the old sense of word but to maintain civil unrest, to keep forever the hierarchic system of power and control over the subdued masses that are called the prols or proletariats. IngSoc alters books, articles, statistics, people’s minds, everything, even history. The prols believe that they had overthrown old capitalists and became the true history makers whilst they are not. The Party (well-deserved analogy to communist one) kills and humiliates anyone who even started thinking in not a favourable way to the regime. There is no difference in the eyes of the Party between a thought and action. You think another way, you’ll be vaporized in every sense of the word. The Thought Police will see to that. The sex is forbidden. Love is tolerated as long as it can produce children, future soldiers or mothers of soldiers. Winston is loathing all this. He wants a freedom in everything, in thoughts, in actions, in literature, in social life. He rebels against oppression and wants emancipation. He joined a rebellion movement called Brotherhood. Maybe that’s one of the reasons why the writer also included a sexual life between Winston and Julia into the book. Winston and Julia were captured, tortured and humiliated. in the end They betrayed each other. This betrayal is slightly described not as a weakness against physical torture but as a normal thing when it comes to the mind torture. I kind of advocate this betrayal in the book so that the readers can fully grasp the sufferance and anguish the people of the totalitarian states must endure all their life. "
1958,Seifeddine Dridi,"When I started reading this book, I felt like I was entering a new world that is different yet similar in many ways to the world we currently live in. The story revolves around an average person named Winston Smith who lives in a country ruled by an oppressive regime that tries to control everything people seem to care about. For instance, there is the Ministry of Love, which punishes any couple who develop the slightest inclination toward loving each other. There is the Ministry of Truth, which seeks to falsify historical events in a way that promotes the Party and helps maintaining an image of leadership and superiority in the eyes of its citizens.Big Brother is a symbol of supreme leadership; no one knows if he is dead or alive, but everybody must love him unconditionally and never attempt to question his existence. Anyone who dares to express his hatred toward him will be considered as sick, and will be treated immediately by experts who will purify his mind and remove all doubts from it.The Party uses various means to control and shape people's thoughts: Telescreens in each home, the Thought police, the concept of Doublethink, which relies on the idea that something could be true and false at the same time. Doublethink is a mind-manipulation technique, which makes the victim be fully subjected to the oppressor and unable to form his own ideas.George Orwell's 1984 made me realize that in the face of an oppressive and powerful dictatorship, it is hard to fight back and revolt because the problem has escalated beyond any single man's capabilities. I believe that Nature has its ways of dealing with problems at such a big scale; it might take it some time before it reaffirms balance once again, but as history tells us, Nature always wins."
1959,Amr Medhat,"رواية عبقرية ... ينجح الكاتب العبقري في توصيل شعوره للقارئ بطريقة عبقرية .. أحسست وأنا اقرأه بظلام من حولي وضيق الحال كما يشعر بطل الرواية ""وينستون سميث"" .. الرواية تتكلم بشكل رائع عن أنظمة الحكم القمعية والمستبدة وتحفز الثوار للتحرك ضد البطش .. ولكن النهاية علي الرغم من عبقريتها ولكنها أصابتي بالإكتئاب من شدة واقعيتها وجمالها .. رواية رائعة وتحكي تفاصيل حياتنا الحالية وما نعيش فيه الآن علي الرغم أن الكاتب ألفها في أواخر أربعينات القرن الماضي."
1960,NIKITA,"The book was far better than my expectations.The negative utopia,sci-fi genre,romance made it a great read and I really enjoyed every part of the book.An unputdownable book and also mysterious.The protagonist Smith Wilson's transformation from a rebel to one who loves Big Brother was painful.1984 exposes the worst crimes imaginable-the destruction of truth,freedom and individuality.The ending was also great.I wish the story never ended.I read two interpretations of the ending,one in which Winston dies and the other in which he dreams of dying.I prefer the first one.But anyway the real Winston already died in room-101.Its definitely a must read.The story of a man losing his originality and becoming the puppet of the party leaves you craving for more."
1961,Zahra'a Mousa,"لم أقرأ شيئًا كهذا من قبل! إنه مفجع, مفجعٌ وحقيقي إنها روايةٌ تُقرأ, ثم تقرأ من جديد "
1962,Dylan Sutro,I absolutely love orwell and this exquisite piece of lit.
1963,Edward,"Deserving to be called a classic. Phenomenally written, somewhat depressing but so incredibly relevant today it should be read by everyone that didn't have to in school. George Orwell is so insanely engrossing to read as details spring forth constantly but with no superfluous over analyzation. You are Winston Smith once you've gotten far enough, and then G.O. adds a whole new dimension midway through the story to fuck you up even more. This book opens a perspective that your brain can never not see from again. "

1965,Sarah AlObaid,"I knew this book was amazing but i had no idea just how amazing. This book is effing genius. The world is just.. Mind-blowing. So well-constructed and thought-out. Loved it.The thing about this book is that it's so eye-opening and enlightening and it carries such a deep message, and yet it was thoroughly entertaining at the same time.The ending was not what i expected but i've come to realize that i love sad and dramatic endings more that happy and cheesy ones.1984 was so complex and sophisticated that some parts took me very long to get through. (*spoiler alert* Like the part where winston was reading Goldstien's book which was solely political and required my full and complete attention)It's one of the best books i have ever read, to be honest even though i spent a relatively long time reading it.Also, the whole idea of Newspeak was absolutely flawless. I thought it added even more depth to the world and Ingsoc.However, and truth be told, i thought there were some holes in the world-building and i had some questions that went unanswered.*spoiler alert*Like, for example, if the party edits every book and every newspaper ever written so that it suits its ideology, what happens to the already existing copies and the published books? Does the party send people to recollect them every single time something had to be edited? Were they burned and disposed of and new copies had to be printed each and every time? And if so, doesn't that mean that the party has to spend tons and tons of money just on that process alone? Wouldn't that hugely affect the economy? Or were the people simply not allowed to own books?Also, why, at end of the book, when Winston was set free did nobody pay attention to him? Why was it completely okay for him to speak with Julia and touch her without any bit of worry?And what the hell is the deal with O'Brien? Was he pretending the whole time? Was he so twisted that he was sane? Was he a part of the brotherhood but was so good at hiding it? Does the brotherhood exist at all?*Sigh* so many questions, so many questions. "
1966,Qelender Memmedli,"This is one of the best books which I have ever read. I liked Orwell`s thinking style and imagination. He gave information from future like Nostradamus. His abstracttion style is so normal and you really feel that utopic world. The torment which had been done to Winstone made me so upset and nervous. Being on the level it was so difficult to endure those happenings. I felt them, I imagined and Liked. I recommend this book, read it ;)"
1967,Linda,"Fantastic! And, very disturbing! The things brought up makes you think of society today, and how one should pay more attention to/ and question, everything we are being told and shown. Things such as history, media, music and books even. 1984 is really worth a read! "
1968,Hyperliteratura,"Autorul propune o alternativă a istoriei care să demonstreze publicului cititor că în primul rând gândurile, iar în al doilea rând faptele, pot avea urmări greu de imaginat. Pentru că da, de cele mai multe ori faptele urmează gândurilor. Gradul uriaș de conștientizare pe care îl implică natura umană nu este îndeajuns pentru infrânarea instinctului de a refuza ceea ce nu ne place sau de a exprima prin vis, gânduri refulate. Tocmai această axiomă este foarte bine înțeleasă de Orwell și exploatată în toate sensurile ei.Citește continuarea pe Hyperliteratura:http://hyperliteratura.ro/orwell/"

1975,Mac,"It was difficult to get interested in, but is worth the struggle. It was very slow paced, and the plot didn't actually start until about a third of the way through the book, but after all it wasn't written by Michael Bay, so it both had a good plot, and it had an actual meaning. This book is like a warning not to let computers and government take over and control every aspect of our lives, including what we believe. The main character Winston lives in a world in which anybody not affiliated with the government is constantly being tricked into thinking that their government is flawless, and always doing the right thing. They are also always watching each person's every move, and know everything they do, and will execute what they call ""Thought criminals,"" which is the name they give to to anyone who has opinions on anything that opposes those of the government. Orwell's prophetic warning of our potential future is an important piece of advice which should certainly be remembered for years to come."

“Being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.”
(view spoiler)[How to begin describing this little masterpiece... As you read 1984 it becomes clear George Orwell was way ahead of his time when he wrote his novel back in 1948. The vision of his negative utopia is easily to be called brilliant: a world set in the nearby future where personal identity doesn't exist, collectivism is the key and war is used as a way to suppress the masses. Reading about the lives of the two main characters Winston and Julia in this dystopian world where 'Big Brother is watching you'  is both interesting and disturbing. Orwell definitely hit the mark with certain points in his book... Examples include the mass media trying to control life, politicians preferring people to be ignorant and politicians using the continuous war as an excuse to keep peace and order. A definite must read!Life in 1984 is made into a routine where individualism is a crime and everyone should live exactly as the Party orders. The world in 1984 can be seen as an aftermath of the Second World War and is divided into three states: Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. The three states are in continuous state of war and all governments use the war as an excuse to suppress their population. Every single movement people make is controlled by the state and disobedience detected by the Tought Police, by the telescreens placed in every home and public space and even by their own children who will betray them within a heartbeat to the authorities. Punishment? Getting arrested by the Tought Police and a almost certain one-way trip to the Ministry Of Love. And trust me, things inside that ministry aren't that rosy at all; you can say things get pretty ugly inside.Winston works for the Ministery Of Truth where he is one of the workers in charge of revising and changing past newspapers and any other messages so they don't contradict the current situation in Oceania nor the authorities. The Party with Big Brother as their leader believes that 'he who controls the past controls the future.' And that 'he who controls the present controls the past' . In short, they are falsifying history and people are behaving like brainwashed zombies and don't even seem to realize it. Unfortunately for Winston, he is different. He does notice something is off, but even only thinking about that is a crime (thoughtcrime) in Oceania and he knows it. The authorities are doing everything in their power to make people ignorant, even altering the language into one where there are no words left to express yourself.Even when he knows it will be his end, Winston tries to defy the Party anyway and starts a diary. Things become even more dangerous when a co-worker called Julia expresses her love for him and soon start a love affair... They have to hide their every move since love for the sake of love is forbidden in Oceania and can get them arrested. People aren't suppost to have physical interest in each other and only state approved marriages are allowed to 'fulfill their duty' and create the next generation. Winston and Julia also get involved in an underground organization against Big Brother and manage to hide their relationship for quite some time. But no good things can last forever, and soon the day they dreaded arrives at last... I think this novel by George Orwell was one of my favorite reads of this year. Or at least one of my favorite classics. If you haven't read 1984 yet, I strongly suggest you do. Trust me, it's worth it. And if you already have, you probably know why I am lost for words describing this story... (hide spoiler)]

1977,Eng Mohmad,منذ فترة اثار خبر القبض على طالب بكلية الهندسه جامعة القاهرة لحمله لرواية 1984 سخرية الكثير وانا منهم تهكم من معارضى الانقلاب على جهلهم ....ولكن بعد قرأتى للرواية تأكدت من ان الانقلابين ليسوا اغبياء ولا جهلة ...ولكن اذكياء جدا ومثقفين ...لان تللك الرواية تمثل خطر كبير عليهم ..فأنا لاأظن انه من عاقل او حتى انسان طبيعى بعد قراته لتلك الرواية يمكنه ان يدعم او يؤيد حتى معنويا اى نظام ديكتاتورى شمولى ....صحيح ان الرواية تحتوى على بعض المبالغات ولكن لو قارن احدنا بين معظم تفاصيلها وبين حال بلدنا لوجدنا شبه كبير مثل عبودية الشخص من اول عبد الناصر حتى السيسى ...مثل تحريف التاريخ ومحو الماضى ...فكرة المحافظة على فقر الناس وجهلهم حتى المحافظه على وجود المرض والمرضى ...فكرة عدم قتل المعارضين حتى لايصبحوا ابطال ولكن كسرهم والسيطره على عقولهم بكل الوسائل القذرة والابقاء عليهم حتى يكونوا عبره لمن يفكر فى عمل مثلهم ...ملخص الكلام ان الرواية خطر على اى نظام شمولى لان اى نظام شمولى يعتمد فى بقائه على جهل الناس والرواية تعمل على تعليم الناس واذا تعلم الناس وفهموا فهذا اخطر شئ على النظام 
1978,the gift,"another favorite i have neglected to place, i read this first when i was 14, an old hardback at home, about the same time as great gatsby. i have read this at least 3 times. so an interesting intro to literature of ideas, something particularly bleak. the vision of switching enemies, getting your hate on, of power for sake of power. the essay on new english made me cognizant of the power of words to distort or even create realities. so many ideographic terms, from thought police to big brother, insures this will never become dated even now after 1984. hard to believe it has given a name to so-called reality tv. have to be aware of the power of media only just becoming apparent at the time written, brave new world is the one to read for that.http://www.michaelkamakana.com/uncate..."
1979,Ghada Yusuf,تحكي الرواية الخيالية 1984 أحداث المستقبل بعد 35 عاماً من الحرب العالمية الثانية وقد تم تقسيم العالم بين ثلاث حكومات مستبدة متناحرة في الظاهر، ومتضامنة في الباطن بإتفاق ضمني يتخذ من الحرب ذريعة تساعد كل منهم علي السيطرة علي البشر الواقعين تحت براثنها. والكتاب مقسم إلي ثلاثة أجزاء رئيسية كل جزء منها مقسوم إلي عدة فصول وعبر بطل الرواية ونستون وبإسلوب أدبي شائق ومتمكن يرسم الكاتب بمهارة تفاصيل الحياة اليومية تحت نير الإستبداد حتي تكاد تري الجدران الكالحة والعاصمة المتهدمة وتلمس الأزمات الإقتصادية وتضيق بشظف العيش وتشعر بالتبلد الذي خدر مشاعر الناس وضمائرهم، وينتابك الخوف الذي يسيطر علي حياتهم التي تخضع أدق خلجاتها للمراقبة ليل نهار، لكنك تظل متيقظ لدرجة كافية أن تدرك رمزية ذلك الحكي وتبدأ تري أوجه التشابه الذي يصل إلي حد التطابق بين هذا السلوك الإستبدادي أو ذاك بما يمارس هنا أو هناك علي أرض الواقع في أحد الدول الواقعة تحت ضغط الإستبداد أو حتي في أحد المؤسسات أو بين شلة أصدقاء، لتدرك كلما توغلت في الفصل الأول أن الديكتاتورية لغة عالمية متطابقة التفاصيل في كل عصر وكل ثقافة. وفي الفصل الثاني تعيش مع وينستون تطور تمرده علي تعاليم المستبد متمثلة في قصة حبه المحرمة مع إمرأة يبدو أنها تماثله في تمردها علي إستعباد الحزب الحاكم للبشر والحياة المفروضة عليهم رغم يأسهما الذي يصل لدرجة اليقين من تحررهم من القبضة المحكمة للمستبد وتأكدهما من إنكشاف أمرهما في النهاية لدرجة عدم إبدائهم أدني مقاومة عند القبض عليهما فعلياً. تتحقق في الفصل الثالث كل مخاوف وينستون بحذافيرها وأسوأ من ذلك يتبخر تمرد وينستون نفسه لدرجة يخالجك معها الشك في تمرده من البداية فتظن أنه ربما كان إختلاجه جثة قبل رقادها الأخير، وتنتهي الرواية بإستسلام وينستون الكامل الشامل حتي أعمق أعماقه للمستبد القاهر الذي لا يهدأ قبل أن يحقق الإستيلاء الكلي علي المستبد بهم. وخلال هذا الحكي يفصل الكاتب ببساطة ووضوح مبهرين هدف المستبد من إستبداده، والسبل التي يسلكها لتحقيق هذا الهدف وتفاعل ضحاياه معه.إنها رواية تقرأ ثم تقرأ ثم يعاد قرأتها مرات ومرات.
1980,Pranav,"Brilliantly written. As you near the end, you cannot help but marvel at George Orwell's genius level imagination."

1982,AJ," This Novel has somewhat initiated me into the World of the controlling dictatorship elites literature. Although, I am not a fan of gruesome and despicable torture tactics which the author made a point of adding it to the end of the book. I believe that George Orwell simply outdid himself with this masterpiece of a novel with the imageries, plot and literacy wise aspects that both entertained and proved to be in many ways a work of art that is ahead of its time. No wonder it was banned for a while.Excellent read. I recommend it for all matured readers."
1983,Adi Narayan Mandalemula,"Ever since I read Orwell's 1984, the one thing I have in mind is, most people are missing the point. Concentrating on one target and ignoring the other big threat - Concept of God, Religion. Religion has the full capacity to bring about Orwell's nightmare into reality. Probably it already has. All double talk. Discouragement of free thinking. Encouragement of blind belief. And religion promoters everywhere in the world constantly brainwashing us about how big losers we are going to be if we stop believing in God. Threatening. Ridiculing. In rare circumstances - Condemning, Outcasting. And in the case of revolutionaries - First trying to make them feel guilty, and then eventual murder. The problem can be solved if the 85% of the people (general citizens) start looking for the real truth and revolt against the biggest delusion of the human race (even bigger than Geocentrism), but as Orwell rightfully predicted, general people just won't care to revolt, in fact, they would be terrified to. And if somebody revolts, he'll be forced to believe just how wrong he is and feel enormously guilty about his revolt and then some more. Well, Orwell's 1984 is a true work of Genius."
1984,Henry Taylor,"First half didn't do much for me - probably as the totalitarian distopia concept wasn't new. Second half brought the book into its own, however - so brutal and uncompromising, especially the last couple of chapters, which have a take on what we would do when faced with torture that I think is all too true."
1985,Patrícia,"Começar a ler um livro com expectativas altas não costuma ser um bom presságio para a leitura. Não foi o caso. Adorei este livro e a pergunta que me faço é “porque demorei tanto tempo a pegar-lhe?”.É-me difícil acreditar que este livro foi escrito em 1948. É que continuaria a ser um grande livro se tivesse sido escrito hoje. Mas a verdade é que foi escrito há quase 70 anos e continua hoje a ser um livro fantástico.Vejo os clássicos como obras primas da literatura. São-no porque são literariamente especiais, fazem um retrato de época mas geralmente respeitam uma série de regras que só fazem ser sentido porque foram escritos em determinada altura. Nada disto se passa com o 1984. Este livro não precisa de qualquer enquadramento para ser lido e apreciado. Não faz um retrato de uma época, em vez disso apresenta-nos uma sociedade alternativa e é brilhante. Atualmente estão na moda as distopias (lembro-me por exemplo dos “Jogos da fome” e de“Divergente”). Sinceramente não acredito que estes livros existissem sequer se o 1984 não tivesse sido escrito. Acredito que este livro mudou o mundo. E a verdade é que não mudou apenas o mundo de quem gosta de ler. Para o melhor e para o pior trouxe-nos o conceito de Big Brother, de total ausência de privacidade. Seria de pensar que quem lê o livro ficaria com asco ao BB. No entanto alguém que efetivamente leu o livro (ou terá apenas ouvido falar da história?) lembrou-se que seria interessante espetar com 12 pessoas em algo parecido a esta sociedade. Enfim…Poderia contar-vos a história. Seria tão fácil fazê-lo mas isso iria, a quem ainda não leu este livro, estragar a leitura. Para quem já leu o livro: é ótimo não é? Dá arrepios, não vos parece? A lógica subjacente a toda a sociedade é tão simples que quase dá para acreditar que iria funcionar. Quase… Não posso deixar de realçar a linguagem que o autor inventou para este livro. Horrível a ideia de limitar a liberdade limitando a capacidade de exprimir ideias por inexistência de vocabulário. E no entanto, cada vez menos utilizamos a fabulosa língua que temos, limitando-nos a nós próprios exatamente da mesma forma.http://www.ler-por-ai.blogspot.pt/201..."

1987,Cindy,"Although you would think this book is pretty far-fetched on the surface, it really makes you wonder how far the government (Big Brother) will go to establish a certain level of control over citizens. It also made me wonder about the tie between government and big corporations. Such things as vote buying, ""special"" favors from Congress members, tax breaks for big corporations, etc. I am NOT by any means a big corporation hater or anti-government person. I do believe we need a certain level of ""control"" and rules to follow, but just how far will it go? Can money and power buy just about everything? We are now required to carry car insurance, health insurance, etc. This was not the case 20 years ago. I wonder what it will be like 20 years from now. Where do we draw the line? Should there even be a line? What about your job? Suppose Big Brother starts ""assigning"" jobs to people according to their skills. Just some things to consider. Great book."
1988,Bob S,Very well written; this book draws you in and gives you a chance to identify with a person living in a Totalitarian state that has been represented in the extreme.

1994,Al,"One of the darkest, if not THE darkest novel I have ever read, 1984 left me in horror for days after I've finished it. This was the first time in my life I actually realized that such repressions and privacy limitations are something that is already part of our world, and though it is not in such a dark form and a combination of all of the horrors described in the novel, it still exists and is a regular cycle of our struggle with ourselves. Orwell presents a view of our society where we are incessantly controlled by police and government, something that is not far from our reality, and only accentuates our need to stand by personal liberty and individualism. The novel teaches us to be always on guard for our own freedom, to struggle on our own rather than be left at the mercy of extraneous agents, and to constantly exercise our rights. That's the only way to have a truly democratic society, a democracy that comes from the people not from a selection of higher-class rulers. The images of Big Brother, the Ministry of Love and the Newspeak will always stay in my mind and keep me sane whenever I feel I may give in and forget about my liberties."
1995,Ioana,"Lumea lui Winston Smith este o lume degradată până la absurd, o lume a inconştienţei şi îndobitocirii, o lume a brainwashingului pentru putere, o lume în care trecutul este falsificat în fiecare zi, iar adevărul este travestit în favoarea unei logici bolnave... Citeşti 1984 cu o vagă frământare de nesupunere, cu sentimentul că ceva trebuie, trebuie să rupă firul existenţei mizere! Oamenii sunt manipulaţi până la dezumanizare; nu mai au amintiri, sentimente, atitudini sau trăriri care să scape controlului politic. Cuvintele sunt desfiinţate pentru că nu mai au utilitate, iar arta în sine devine derizorie. Când oamenii trăiesc precum animalele, bălăcindu-se în propria lor mizerie fizică şi psihică, iar orice pulsiunea sexuală este folosită ca motor al maşinăriei politice, omul rămas în normalitate se întreabă dacă nu cumva el este cel dement.Citeşti şi speri că cineva sau ceva va trezi acea lume din coşmarul existenţei monstruase, iar în final descoperi cu oroare că în faţa durerii şi suferinţei nimeni nu este incoruptibil, ci oricine poate deveni găunos, contradictoriu şi lipsit de sens dacă aplici torturile potrivite... ""Ce poţi face în faţa unui nebun mai inteligent decât tine, care stă şi îţi ascultă argumentele cu calm şi pe urmă stăruie în nebunia lui?"" "
1996,Tris Prior,"I had to read this book for senior English and to be honest, I had been dreading it since I saw it on the syllabus. Everyone I talked to who had read it said it was one of the most boring things they had ever read. And was it boring? You bet it was. The first two parts (it is split into three parts) were extremely boring. Typical dystopian book. Controlling government, main character who is unhappy and wants to rebel (although unlike YA dystopian books, not even a young female protagonist I could relate to), love interest, and joining the rebellion. AND ... a bonus that you don't find in YA dystopian novels ... about 30 pages of political philosophy!!! SNOOZE. Okay, so admittedly I didn't like the first two thirds (which is most of the book) all that much. But wait. I thought that I knew where the plot was going. I thought Winston was going to join the Brotherhood and help overthrow the government, everyone lives happily ever after, the end. I never saw the plot twist coming. The ""leader"" of the Brotherhood was actually just fooling Winston into admitting he was against the Party! Who knows if the Brotherhood even exists???? (If you ask me, it was made up and even if it was real, it would never make any sort of progress). Everything, every ""act of rebellion"" that Winston had made throughout the entire novel had been FUTILE!!! The Thought Police had been watching him the WHOLE TIME. Winston doesn't join the rebellion and become a hero! He gets brainwashed, and becomes just like everyone else. That ending will stick with me forever because it wasn't a happy one. It was hopeless! This book made me think so much about what ""knowing"" actually means, about the role of government, and about our society today! This book was amazing. I was pleasantly surprised. "
1997,Mrs. Roy,"Wow. This book gave me the chills and had my heart racing; it was terrifying and eerily familiar. The ""book within a book"" sequence was tough to get through, but I feel this is a must-read for everyone. I am thinking that this book and Brave New World will be taught in tandem in the new AP lit class.Update 4/17/14 I read this with my AP class and I think they enjoyed it more than any of the other novels we read this year. It really is timeless."
1998,Yazan Azzam,To be read again .. 
1999,Sapnabhat,"I started reading this book because it was the most recommended book. As I started reading it, I did not find it difficult to grasp what the author was trying to say. That is one of the unique parts of this book. Generally, in our elementary and high school years, upon hearing the concepts of dictatorship, totalitarianism, fascism and the like, we used to groan,""NOT AGAIN!!!"". But Orwell's style of writing of this wonderful dystpoian novel is gripping and ceases to bore us. The amount of imagination used by the author in this novel doesn't seem to be far from reality. Though this is a fiction novel, we don't feel that the contents in the novel are hilariously out of the world, which is very normal in case of fiction novels. Though Orwell had written this novel in 1949 predicting what might happen in 1984, his predictions aren't completely fictional. Most of the times, knowingly or unknowingly, we are believing many concepts without using our logic and reasoning. Are we really rational beings as we proudly call ourselves? Think about it. A wonderful book. The best dystopian novel ever. Period."
2000,Maarten Kuiper,"When first I started reading 1984 I felt annoyed and somewhat frustrated. The world in which Winston Smith lives is one of total dictatorial control, made clear by the first part of the book. When thinking about why (thank God we can still wonder WHY) this book annoyed me so much, it struck me. I felt, by reading about the world in which Winston lived, like my head was pushed under water and I was not allowed to breathe for just long enough as not to let me faint. The gasp of fresh air came in the form of a shop filled with little trinkets. A place where the so called ""free past"" seems to have somewhat materialized, if only in objects. All seemed to go well when Winston ends up renting a room above this shop and having a thing with another party member. Plenty of breathing for me here! But then... Back into the water, just deep enough to keep gasping for air, but too shallow to actually drown. The ending was somewhat unsatisfactory to my annoyance with the world created by George Orwell. Great book, great read!"
2001,Iqbal Al-Zirqi,"I dont know what to write after reading it!! I will say: devastated, depressed and very sad. It was a magnificant piece of work, that describes to us how any ideology based on one view can destroy human soul. What struk me is how this ideology of big brother did not make execuses for what the party did of torture or falsification of history or dividing love in family or the double thinking philosophy and disinhibition of instincts like sex! it just said frankly that their aim is to make human as zero, as nothing, in order to keep life going on!! We want power for sake of power, and all human lives are nothing but insignificant. All the universe is an image made by us, creating it and putting it in the mind. It almost describes an alian mentality; As if big brother or his concept is made to destroy humans!!! The story was written in 1948 describing the time of big brother in Oqyania in 1984, in the future. The world was controlled by Oqyania (in London), Orasia and Eastasia. It was mainly about Winston who was a simple member in the Party, by force, not by his will!! An orphan who lost his family cause of the party, and has diffuse foggy memories about good warm moments with his mum, and little sister who disappear suddenly! The author was genious in writing this, not only to warn us from the communism at that time in 1948, but also in telling us how every thing can be a misconception or inception! The love story between Winston and Julia could not last, of course, as u would expect. There are no surprises here, and if the author finishes his story with a different ending, may be less depressing than what we got, then it would be a dissappointment too ! I think, no matter, the darkness I saw, the apathy and indifference I experienced while reading it, just thinking that this novel was written will make me always not giving up. When I see all these people with brain wash around me, those who dont have a will, those who are deprived, or those who are just miserable by others, I know that they find a way to live, to survive, and transmit their hidden seeds of fighting spirit into the stars, or dust, or new future genes! I read the novel in Arabic, and I think the translation was very good, as I did not feel any interruption in the flow of words, or even the poetic expressions used especially by the internal monlogue of Winston. I guess, every one should have a different way how this story should end! Just one thing about torture: it was so described in details that it creeps u and u wish u just kill yourself instead of all this. I wonder how many totalist systems used these torture technique til our modern time by all kinds of regimes. I wonder how humans created torture, and how they became so creative in it, in destroying themsleves. Amazing to see how the leaders make the war as good way to step on the dignity and dreams of the ordinary people, so that the leaders get always safe. When the lower class loses all intellect just to find a way to feed the mouth, and when the middle class brag about the previlages, the tiny previlages they have,this is how revolutions are terminated before they start!I wish I could write more, but I am honest when I say: I am devastated !"
2002,Jim,"It's been a long time since I last read this book and I'd forgotten the lengthy section of Goldstein's book, which gives Orwell a chance to expound his theories of power relationships, governments, and war. Naturally, I couldn't help but ponder the recent Cheney administration and the war on terror. It fits right into Goldstein/Orwell's ideas about keeping a population agitated and fearful and how that makes it easier to govern. Some prescient pondering from Mr. Orwell, that...Also good to contemplate the ideas about limiting access to information, particularly about foreigners and enemies, and how this control of information allows for totalitarian control of a population. Freedom of Information is tyranny's biggest enemy.If you haven't read this book before, then get ye to the bookinist post-haste! Amazon Big Brother is watching!"
2003,Sprinky,"I last read this book as an assignment in 9th grade and did not like it at all. Although we had to write a couple essays about it, we barely discussed it, and very soon it was just shoved aside, forgotten. Three years later, my AP Lit exam is coming up and I decided to read a classic to prepare myself. I look through my bookshelf and see my copy of 1984, and think, why not, I'll read this one. IT. WAS. AMAZING.I honestly cannot understand how the depth of this book totally escaped me the last time I read it. I think it was the sex. I was a very innocent child, and I remember very clearly thinking how disgusting the sex in this book is. However, I had just read three aSoIaF books just before reading 1984, and the sex in Martin's series makes the sex in 1984 seem like hugging. Not to mention that the sex in 1984 actually had a meaning: it was rebellion. For whatever reason, I did not realize this last time. I did not realize a lot of things last time. And if I was to reread this book in another three years, I am sure I will find even more things I did not realize this time or last time. The Party's brainwashing techniques and mind games were BRILLIANTLY TWISTED. And the whole idea that nothing is real except what you make real, like O'Brien is flying is he and everyone else thinks he is, is just SO BIZARRE. I loved this book. I think it is one of my favorites now, up there with Harry Potter, the Gone series, and aSoIaF. "
2004,Marcelle Warren,"Reading this, I felt every step of the way that one more push could cause me to denounce the book as over-the-top, but it always managed to keep itself in the incredibly uncomfortable realm of familiar hyper-realism. Overall, this book is basically the instruction manual to North Korea, but even divided into parts, I found that I was relating various facets of the story to everyday life. The more direct suppression and surveillance reminded me of the looming police state whose musk fills the air in present-day North America, whereas the aspects of thoughtcrime and Newspeak, more often than not, reminded me of the ultra-""progressive"" left, much to my unease. But then I suppose you know a classic by its ability to withstand the ages.I feel captivated by this story structurally as well. The entire thing is very cerebral, with lots of chess-like exposition, and where there is no dialogue, there is an airtight atmosphere of anxiety and fear. Much like Winston, the reader is not made to feel secure for a single moment, and in the only moment that serves as an exception to this rule, the reader, and Winston, pay dearly for their foolishness.If you want a political thriller, then I can only point out the obvious: there is a reason why philosophy classes tend to have this book in their curricula. There is a reason why pirate copies of this book are shipped to countries like Iran where simply owning one could entail penalty. There is a reason this book won't die."
2005,Omnia Ahmed,"!كتاب مهم ... غالبأً احنا بدأنا فى أحداثه فعلياً "" اذا قبل الناس الأكذوبة التى ألزمهم بها الحزب , وإذا كانت كل السجلات تحكى القصة نفسها, فإن الأكذوبة تدخل التاريخ وتصبح حقيقة ... """
2006,Christian Mock,"While reading (currently near the middle of Part Two):When 1984 first began, I couldn't help but feel that Winston and the other characters were rather one dimensional and that the storyline was mundane. However, as the book progressed, my interest grew. Orwell's portrayals of the totalitarian government and Winton's contradictory feelings to such a government (""freedom is the freedom to say two plus two equals four. if that is granted all else follows"") create a thoughtful and intriguing plot that leaves the reader asking one simple question: how will it end?Also, by introducing Mr. Charrington and Julia, Orwell creates a certain hope for the reader. Winston can cultivate a loving relationship and experience new feelings while successfully avoiding the Thought Police. The addition of the O'Brien's mysteriously hopeful atmostphere also seems to encourage a positive future for Winston and the world around him. I am currently at the part where Winston is explaining the loss of his mother and sister, and I'm extremely curious about how the story will end.After reading:The story really began to take hold after Winston and Julia met with O'Brien. For the first time, the reader is given a concrete hope that a ""brotherhood"" does indeed exist and could potentially hold the power to overthrow a seemingly unconquerable totalitarian state. Though Winston doesn't really learn anything new from Goldstein's work, he is inspired all the same. One of the most dramatic events occurs when Winston and Julia are arrested above Mr. Charrington's shop. I honestly did not see such a change coming, but I was actually glad that this wasn't a typical ""happy ending."" Winston's time spent in the Ministry of Love's holding cell is horrifyingly uneventful; though nothing really seems to be happening, the reader dreads where Winston will end up (presumably ""room 101""). O'Brien's treatment of Winston is grueling and frustrating. O'Brien clearly portrays how the government has the power to completely alter history, not to mention just how easily people believe what they are told. I felt the final ending, though admittedly a shock, summed up the messages of the book clearly. I also think it leaves the reader with a thought; don't let the government ever become like Big Brother, or there will be no hope for the future."
2007,Allison Lepontois,"During:I am very intrigued. Sophomore year we read ""Brave New World"" and the idea of 1984 which was implied was that the book was a failure (compared to Huxley's) because Orwell had incorrect visions of life in the next 20 years. However, I find this book to be better than ""Brave New World."" So far it is easier to follow. What baffles me the most is how it is illegal to think. The concept of absolute power is well achieved, but it is impossible not to think. Even without realizing we are thinking what to do because we have to tell our body what to do while doing simple tasks such as brushing teeth. So far this is the only aspect which I cannot let myself believe about the book. Other than that the writing style makes me feel sucked into the life of Oceania and makes me want to contiune reading.Review:After finishing 1984 I was frustrated since the last line is ""He loved Big Brother,"" which means it is impossible in Oceania to have your own opinions or to disintegrate the government. The last line gave up all hopes that I had throughout the book that Smith could break apart the power. Overall I really enjoyed 1984, it was my favorite summer read just because it followed one character so it allowed me to become apart of Smiths story. In addition it has everything from love, torture, future technology, betrayal, and dictatorship which made it interesting and not redundant. The book made me think about how lucky we are to live in a nation which grants us many rights and allows us to protest the government without harm."

2009,Ahmad Abugosh,"This is my favorite novel of all time! I've read it many times, and I'll probably read it many more. It touches me on so many levels. It expresses the very essence of the human spirit and has so many metaphors about life and the society we live in. Orwell is such a great author that he does it in a way that is very easy to follow without introducing too many characters. Instead he focuses almost solely on the protagonist in a way that makes you feel that you are actually him. I can relate to the way he battles with his constant censorship, while keeping hope in the human spirit overcoming. I don't want to spoil the ending, but it gives me chills when I think about it, even after reading it more than once. Whatever I say about this book won't do it justice. You have to read it! "

2012,Kashish,"This book is seriously... Wow. There is so much depth to all the characters and the setting and just... I can't even think of where to begin, so i'll start with the end. I read the last line at the start and i didnt think much of it and so i was reading the book knowing what kinda happened at the end, but when i read it at the end the sentence had so much more meaning to it, knowing all that he went through and i was choking up just reading it becuase i kept thinking that his last wish was to die hating big brother and die a free man and that ending just broke my heart into a million pieces and each of those pieces were put into a blender... I felt genuine fear and hatred and sadness and relief and i've never felt so much in one book before. I was surprised at how much i understood Winston and his situation and though i was somewhat confused, i felt like i understood it. But i didn't want to because the reality of the pain and torture just wouldn't sink in and when it did, it hurt. I felt like crying and throwing the book at the wall in anger. This book was reli something more than i ever expected."

2018,Kyle Robertson,"I was recently asked to be on a literacy council for our local school district, and 1984 was on the proposed high school reading list. When they gave me the book I immediately told them yes. I first read it twenty years ago in school, but I went ahead and read it again just to make sure. This is one of those classics, along with Fahrenheit 451, that should always be included in school curriculum. One thing I thought as I was reading it is that having students read this book today could lead to a more fun and engaging experience than when I read it. In 1995-1996, I remember being fascinated that the book was written in 1948 but it was portraying events that could actually happen in my lifetime. As I read it again I am still convinced that the dystopian society where Big Brother is always watching isn't too far of a stretch for the future. The unique opportunity that presents itself for teachers today is to relate this classic to books/movies that their students are probably familiar with that follow along the same lines: Hunger Games, Divergent Trilogy, and Books of Mortals (Ted Dekker).

I didn't necessarily like any characters because one of the book's main story's characteristics centers around NOT having expressive emotions so I wonder if that's why Orwell kept them so dry. Regardless, great read. "
2023,Pseudonymos Powell,"Thoroughly interesting book. I first thought it would be boring and old fashioned, however the political issues and tones and issues still questions political structure and ideology today. Not only that, but I did end up being engrossed by the characters themselves. The decriptions of even the most mundane and obsolete characters were thought out and viberant. At times, my heart raced a million miles a minute due to the plot lines and writing technique. Possibly above all else, without a doubt the most gripping and satisfying ending I have read in a while. Do NOT read this book if you want hollywood fairytales. It is satisfying because it is the correct ending to a very true-at-heart story. Wonderful."

Having been given that impression you would think that one would never desire this book in their memory. It is a ride unlike any other, and due to that this book will hold a place on my shelves that I can't place many others.If you get past the positions of the previous generation, and see the message within this book for what it is, it's amazing. The world in which this book was written was entirely different from our's current. Yet the message, in itself, still stands strong. "

“If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.”
In 1949 when George Orwell wrote 1984, no one realized each and every quote from his novel is going to be so true in the future, yet more than half a century later, his dystopian vision of future is alive and in arduous good health. It’s horrific to even think that your own children are spies of the government and will willingly denounce your own family to the thought police. Today’s world is no different, whenever we search something on google, like a photo on Facebook or make an online purchase, we are giving not just our personal data but even our thoughts to these companies which are inherently controlled by the government. Indeed every apartment, every individual is bugged with a 2 way telescreen. The only way to keep our secret is to bury it deep down inside us and never think about it. The world of 1984 is a perfect metaphor for today.When I started reading this book and came across sentences, rather ideologies such as war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength, The closest real life institution I imagined to this dystopic world was China or north Korea, but as the book progressed it turned out Mr. Orwell proposed the trap of a far worse ideology. A totalitarian institution which controlled your thoughts, where what is not banned is required. China is still authoritarian, which is less deformed face of totalitarian state. North Korea on the other hand is moving towards more of a totalitarian system. When George Orwell wrote this book way back in 1949, he didn’t make a prophecy that the world will be ruled by big brother in future but it was a simple warning to the mankind, and he often proclaimed that 1984 could happen if humankind fell into the traps of big brother and started believing in everything he has to say. He gave a clear message that man should be aware of the assaults on his personal freedom and should defend his most precious right, the right to free will.

2027,J. Preston,"1984 Book ReviewJ. Preston Huffman 3/30/11	1984 was written by the world renowned socialist Eric Lee who’s pen name was George Orwell. Even though he was a socialist he hated communism and was extremely intolerant of intellectuals. He died at forty seven years and left behind some of the world’s most moving books, including 1984.	1984 is set in a world that has become a total communism. It is not only a communism, but totalitarianism where the government controls every aspect of your life: what you do, where you work, what you eat, and even what you think. The country called Oceania is led by “Big Brother” who is always watching you from hidden cameras. The people are constantly afraid of the secret police called the “Thought Police” who can arrest anyone for “Thought Crimes” which are thoughts that do not agree with the ruling party.	Even though 1984 has come and gone, George Orwell’s frightening painting of the world may still become a terrible reality. Almost every aspect of the book has some truth behind it such as the depicted circle of power. George Orwell describes a vicious circle of power in which the government is made up of the upper class and rules over the lower class. When the upper class gets out of hand, the middle class rallies the lower class with promises of a better life and over throws the upper class. The middle class then becomes the upper class and is oppressive against the lower class. They then stay in power for many years until they are also overthrown. The upper class in Oceania stopped this issue by eliminating the middle class with constant war and fake shortages. 	This was an incredible book but is not a light read nor is it satisfying. If you enjoy books with extremely happy endings, then this is not the book for you. 1984 makes you rethink the way you look at the world. It also makes you confirm your political and world views. The book is an extremely emotional book that shows humanity at its best and worst and creates an all too realistic anti-utopia."
2028,George Kingsley,"I tried not to regurgitate what has been previously said about Orwell’s book because it seems rather futile and pointless to me, however, this is my rambling review and interpretation of Nineteen Eighty-Four.George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four is one of the most important, if not relevant, novels of all time. Set in a dystopian landscape where every moment of your life is being observed and scrutinised by Big Brother, an all-powerful, all-knowing persona. In the digital age of Skype, Twitter, Google and countless other social media sites, the entire history of you can now be seen on a computer screen for everyone to see. We tag messages with our current locations, take selfies whenever we feel like it and even find love on the internet, we are aware of other people looking at what we do but do we ever think about the big corporations behind them? Not often. What would Big Brother think of us?Orwell’s book was published in 1949 but Nineteen Eighty-Four could have been published yesterday, I am very glad that I rediscovered this text. It has very much opened my eyes about the world that I live in. It’s easy to think of Nineteen Eighty-Four as a bitter satire of Stalin’s USSR and perhaps the totalitarian regime in North Korea as a contemporary reflection, but there is as much of Nineteen Eighty-Four in the United Kingdom as there is in those aforementioned places. The idea of “thoughtcrime” is a such a striking concept, maybe one day in the far future, for the sake of national security, our thoughts maybe monitored; making sure that we don’t have anti-government thoughts. This may seem like a far-fetched or even trivial observation, which I can understand but look at the state of modern computers for example, 20 years ago the idea of a 3D printer would seem laughable. We live in a year where the idea of a wearable computer, like Google Glass, does not even surprise certain people. Thoughtcrime doesn’t seem too far away too me, give or take a century is my guess (give or take a few centuries, in hindsight). I think a lot of people forget about the love story in Nineteen Eighty-Four, as the dystopian setting seems to be the main talking point about the book. Winston and Julia’s relationship is a very real and naturalistic to me, they squabble and argue but also deeply love each other, cherishing each moment in the black and white lives. Simple pleasures like drinking “real coffee” become a milestone; in fact, just being with each other is enough. Winston Smith has his life turned upside down by Julia: she rekindles and reanimates a youthful lustful spirit in him. They are one. Julia does something to him that he can’t explain. Love does that to Winston Smith. They know that their relationship will never last, it may be weeks, months or even years before they are caught but they will get caught at some point by Big Brother and there is nothing they can ever do to change that fact.To me, Orwell writes love as something beautiful and meaningful but something will eventually die, no matter what. The world of Oceania and Air Strip One is believable, the world of the Outer Party, Inner Party and the Proles are living, breathing worlds. Orwell makes you live through Winston Smith’s monotonous life, you feel the dread and everlasting misery.There are so many quotes that are so powerful in this book, literally pages upon pages of memorable quotations. There are vast sections of Goldstein’s book which could be used as genuine doctrine of political parties on both sides of the political spectrum. I am sure the politics of Nineteen Eighty-Four have been discussed, debated and argued ever since it was published in the 40’s, so I think it’s easier to decipher your own meaning to the politics of the book. I have also learnt a considerable amount about the philosophy and economy of war, the idea of three powerful nations locked in a state of permanent conflict makes so much sense economically, the outcome of the war is meaningless but rather the war is keeping Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia stable. I read a few chapters of Nineteen Eighty Four when I was around 12, I gave up but I loved the premise. I rediscovered the book about three weeks ago, my dad had given me a rather battered copy that he had been given so I gave it a shot. I think everyone should read this book, regardless of their political beliefs (or lack of) or agendas, even non-readers should give it a go. It has to be read."
2029,Rasha,أنا ليه عملت نفسي كده -_- ، رواية 1984 بعد رواية العمى، ده اسمه تعذيب نازي على فكرة :(كتب اورويل 1984 في الأربعينيات ليتخيل حياة البشر في ملحمة سوداوية مُقبضة بعد 40 سنة، مهما حكيت لن تتخيل مالم تقرأها الرواية هي الواقع للآية الكريمة (قَالُواْ أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَن يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَاء) ، تُمثل الرواية قمة الفساد وسفك الدماء وفي أبشع صورة. أما المُرعب بحق هو أنني لم استطع إلا أن أقارن بين الرواية وما يحدث في وطننا. صعب ألا تقارن بل وتجد العديد من التشابهات. عندما كان يصف أحياء العامة كنت أشعر به يصف العشوائيات ، عندما كان يتحدث وينستون عن تزييف الماضي تقفز في مخيلتي عشرات الوجوه التي تمارس هذا علنًا وبمنتهى الصفاقة، عندما يشرح أوبراين كيف تتم عملية السيطرة عليك فلا يكفي أن تقول أن 2+2=5 بل يجب عليك أن تؤمن بهذا أفهمه على الفور فأنا أرى هذا يتم يوميًا.رواية تتركك بلا أمل في غد بل بلا أمل في الحياة من الأساس :(
2030,Sorairo,"Il padre dei distopici non poteva essere un pessimo libro. Anzi è accurato, angosciante e molto relistico. La storia si svolge nel 1984, dopo le guerre mondiali e in un mondo sempre in guerra, stracolmo di regole asfissianti e dove i cittadini sono spiati in ogni istante ed in ogni luogo, costretti ad usare un linguaggio consono e se possibile in Neolingua, la lingua che il Partito e il Grande Fratello hanno imposto. Ogni opposizione viene punita ,in maniera segreta e quindi perfino più rumorosa. Il Grande Fratello ha creato schiavi ed automi, pronti a credere alla storia che il Partito proclama.Ma qualcuno che non è mai del tutto sottomesso c'è . Deve solo trovare coraggio per agire. E in questo caso questo qualcuno è Winston Smith, impiegato del Partito esterno che si occupa di correggere refusi, in realtà inesistenti ,da giornali, libri, film, audio. Lui in realtà odia il Grande Fratello e presto inizierà piccoli atti di ribellione. Per tutto libro non si smette di vivere in angoscia e anche con un poco di speranza anche in un mondo così cupo e crudele. E molto simile al nostro."

2032,Marcella,"1984 é meu livro preferido de todos os tempos. Li na faculdade, reli dois meses depois e, de lá para cá, já li umas quatro vezes. É daqueles livros que não deveriam sequer ser classificados como ficção; tá mais para uma grande metáfora da nossa vida. A existência árida, vazia e cheia de frustrações do personagem principal, Winston Smith, é agoniante. Dá vontade de você ficar se debatendo enquanto lê o livro, berrando 'FAZ ALGUMA COISAAAA!' e aí você percebe que ele não pode fazer nada, porque os ~~poderes nem tão ocultos~~ a sua volta são dominantes demais. O Winston está completamente à mercê da sociedade e do seu líder invisível porém sempre presente, o Grande Irmão. Apesar deste livro ter sido escrito em 1948, esse mundo distópico ditatorial do Orwell tem tanta semelhança com o nosso que chega a bater uma tristeza. Não da mesma maneira como ele imaginou, mas de uma que talvez seja ainda pior, de algumas maneiras - é mais sutil, mais velada. Tanto que na maior parte do tempo nós nem percebemos. Somos escravos de modelos, expectativas e padrões. Somos controlados por informações que são constantemente distorcidas para servir interesses de um lado ou de outro. Somos observados quase que o tempo inteiro. Quanto mais evolui a tecnologia, mais difícil é se manter alheio às influências externas. E parece muito que isso tudo é uma questão de opção... Talvez seja, ainda. Mas quem não se enquadra é logo visto como o esquisito, o doidão, o riponga da maconha.1984 é uma viagem de reflexão. E o final... Diria que é um dos melhores que eu já li. A primeira fase já está nos anais como uma das melhores de todos os tempos, e eu tenho que concordar. ""Era um dia claro e febril de abril, e os relógios marcavam uma da tarde."""
2033,Lext,"(This is a copy of my review for this book in PBS, in case you've seen it there.)I happened upon this book by chance in the library. At that time I vaguely knew it has something to do with Big Brother and an Apple ad, but nothing else. I'm glad I read it though. I think my perspective will probably differ somewhat from the typical American (Western) reader's, but I find the book rather amusing, especially the early parts. It reads like a satire to me, and many times I had to chuckle to myself ""yeah, that's so true"". It's like watching Saturday Night Live where everything is a slightly exaggerated spoof of the real thing. I grew up in a communist country, so I can appreciate a lot of practices mentioned in the book, for example the ever-watchful eyes around you, the banning of true romances, the need for Party-arranged marriage, the practices of unperson (including the act of removing references to someone from text or photos), the de-emphasis of personal feeling, the heavy bureaucracy, the adulation of the paramount leader, etc. (Although truth be told, on the last point the book probably pales compare to the current practice in North Korea). It's scary, it's suffocating, it's depressing, but it's so true. At first I thought that Orwell was so far ahead of his time, since at the time of the publication, there was no Iron Curtain and communist atrocities weren't well-known (or so I thought). But now that I've read more about Stalin's USSR, I realize he got his inspirations from there. Still, pretty insightful book if you've never lived in that system before.(Many people commented that it's a dystopian society in the future. Well I can tell you that there have been times in history in certain countries where it was very very close to being the reality. You should be thankful you're living in a society where you can afford to think it's way off in the future :)Apart from the satirical content, I also find one idea very insightful (it's in the content of the little revolt book), and that is the suggestion of a 3-tier society, and how they've been interacting and probably will continue interacting till the end of time. I find it so funny, in fact I laughed out loud when I got there. Here you go, all the revolutionary thinkers and philosophers of the world, thinking their brains off (and at the cost of sometimes hundreds, sometimes thousands, and sometimes millions of lives) about how to have a better society. And yet all they do is just to rehash and repeat what Mr Orwell has so clearly described before. It's what come closest to capture TRUTH compared to all the other things you see each day (Michael Moore, Occupy movement, Congress, Wall Street, the NK Kim Dynasty, Gengis Khan, the Russian Revolution, the French Revolution, even the American Revolution, and so on). Isn't it amazing?The last thing I really like about the book is the love story. I love the love story. Some people will see it as cold, bleak, unromantic, bland, etc, but I see it as having everything: warmth, tenderness, playfulness, longing, heart. It's love, period. Especially the girl, she's obviously been described by the author as ""the girl of your dream"". She's hard to come by, but if you happen to know her, try to grab her heart before it's too late."
2034,Ahmad Hajja,"This book is simply brilliant! Set aside all the political meanings behind it, this novel manages to establish a horrifying world that one can imagine living in, it manages to transfer you into that world easily and artistically, and it manages to show you and make you feel, in the most horrifying way that'd give you shivers instantly, the true -- or what it believes is true -- nature of humans.I usually quote the best lines, but I didn't do that this time (for various reasons); however I did manage to highlight one line in which I went out of my way to highlight: ""Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood."" From part 3, chapter 3. I thought that was deep, and true to some extent."
2035,Cormac Zoso,"**Warning -- here be spoilers**Everyone is familiar with this story (I would think so on this site at least) and it is a timeless and haunting tale of government control gone to its logical conclusion: Total control over the masses from the time they awake right through their sleeping hours thanks to constant video surveillance. Orwell's prescient story is quite amazing in that there is now (according to a March 2011 article by the Guardian newspaper) one CCTV camera for every thirty-two British citizens. I don't know of another novel (or essay or proclaimed prophetic message even) that has come closer to the actual truth the future brought. Along with ""newspeak"", the language of the government media outlet that gives everything a different meaning or false impression ... we call it ""spinning"" the news these days when it is in fact just a nice way of saying ""being the best and most palpable liar"", Orwell again hit it on the nose of how this world has declined into a sick and malevolent place. Winston Smith, our ""hero"" of sorts, though not a hero in the classical sense and not even an anti-hero in that the typical anti-hero is caught in or aware of a bad situation but he has no interest in changing it but nonetheless ends up taking the heroic stance and winning the day usually at great personal cost to his own well-being, but Smith is simply a man caught trying to have a few basic pleasures (strawberry jam and sex mainly ... tho not in combination) and is betrayed to the ""Thought Police"" by the man he and Julia, his illicit lover and jam-sharer, had been renting a room from for their many rendezvous which they thought were well planned. However, things are as bad for those who don't squeal on their fellow citizens as those who are caught doing what the law says they shouldn't so, again like today, squealing on ""suspected terrorists"" is thought of as patriotic even if there is no way of knowing if the person or persons accused actually are terrorists. They are simply picked up, perhaps but not always given a perp-walk, and then they disappear into various black holes the U.S. Government has set up throughout the world with no legal way for anyone - family, friends, their attorneys (though they have no right to an legal representation since they have no right to habeas corpus, no rights at all at bottom, and so are held incommunicado for however long their captors, again read: the U.S. Government, deem appropriate or until the alleged terrorist succumbs to the torture -- starvation, exposure, accidental drowning during water boarding, or complete mental breakdown as they are often held in a manner where sight and sound are completely deprived, chained to a spot on the floor, and gagged -- commonly used and commonly shown restraint method used by the government and seen by millions of Americans and others throughout the world, will literally drive a perfectly adjusted human being into a mass of irreplaceable psychological jello in just 48 to 72 hours. And we stand by and watch it on the nightly news, these people in their orange jumpsuits chained down to the inside of a C-130 U.S. Army transport plane and are told in the serious, sonorous voiceover that it is the only way to ensure control over these ""terrorist animals"". Of course, there's no proof other than some neighbor saying that this person is a terrorist. And what motivation would that neighbor have to turn in their neighbor? the cash reward from the U.S. which amounts to about a decade of salary for people in the middle east ... or simple revenge of a slight or argument they had with that neighbor some time ago and this was a perfect way to get even ... or perhaps it's just that in the United States that neighbor went to that mosque built in the small suburb about some time ago and they've seen other of 'those kind of people' coming over to that person's house and the group would be there for hours plotting god knows what (sure they were cooking on the barbecue in back or playing badminton ... but that's probably just a cover for the terrorist plots they were hatching) ... and of course without any legal rights, they certainly are guilty if the government says they are.ok i'll just stop there ... it's a great book that means more today than it ever has meant and will continue to mean more and more to thoughtful people as the years go by and we quite happily relinquish our rights, inalienable or otherwise, one after another until it will always be 1984."

2040,Gianmarco,"Orwell forshadows how life would change under a totalitarianism. This dystopian novel speaks about Wiston Smith's life in London, in the nation of Oceania. It is astonishing how he envisioned a world not so different from the one we are living in the present: psychological manipulation, control over informations and history, use of language to control minds. The language Orwell uses contains many words coined by the author which are now common among us. Luckily, this book is in many educational programs. Higly recommended."
2041,Edel,"I had heard so many good things about this book that by the time I finished it I could honestly say that the praise it got was deserved. Here we have a dystopian society in the 1980's in Oceania . Big brother is most definitely watching every person, every thought, everything,even a tasty cup of coffee has been altered so much it does not even resemble real coffee , they are given a substitute!!!!The book is frightening in places.. if you stop.. really think about if this could happen... yikes!!!! To be only allowed to think what you are allowed to think, For punishments to be incredibly cruel and in some cases fatal. You are constantly aware of everything you do and think and try and push those thoughts out of your mind.For not thinking correctly ,and going against what you were told was right here punishment is very harsh almost to the point of losing your mind. Love is not acceptable and black could be white if they say so and 2+2 may not equeal 4 here.It is a strict society where people are more programmed by big brother then living free lives.The book has haunted me while I have been reading it. Truly great book!"
2042,Bobby Sullivan,"Superb adaptation of one of my favorite novels. I love the way the scenes from the novel are moved around chronologically and juxtaposed differently, to give the feeling that Winston's days are interchangeable, like Groundhog Day. And then after he and Julia are caught, the storytelling shifts abruptly to linear, with the dialogue between Winston and O'Brien distilled down to its essence. Powerful telling of this story."
2043,Jay Mishra,"I don't scare easy. 1984 chilled me to the core. And I detested the book even when I rated it a 5.As you probably know, 1984 deals with a dystopian future where Big Brother (good job imitating it, Hollywood) keeps an eye on every human activity through cameras, privacy is a concept unheard of, standard and uniform are the normal and original thinking is frowned upon. But more than just the story, the real scare was the fact that this book could just as easily be rooted in reality.If it sounds like an exaggeration, suffice it to say that soon after reading, I got paranoid about my college professors, simple actions by friends, and started questioning everything around without any basis. And all the same, I would recommend it, because paranoia is a small price to pay if it helps to diminish your ignorance."

2046,Jessica,"Imagine just realizing some amazing, horrifying, mind-blowingly confusing truth about life. Like how psychology is the brain trying to understand itself. Or how every book you've ever read is just a different combination of 26 letters. Now imagine getting that brain-melting feeling by reading something about politics. For 267 pages.Simply put, 1984 is a novel about a dystopian future, complete with an abundance of technology and an all-powerful government feeding its people lies. It's also the story of a man, Winston Smith, trying to get by without drawing the attention of the Inner Party. While it doesn't look much like the society of the year 1984, it can be argued that the main points of the novel are incredibly similar to today's society, especially in the incredibly large technological presence. But hey, I'm not here to interpret it for you. That's your job.I believe that everyone should read this book at some time in their lives, just to gain a different perspective on things. I also recommend this book to anyone who enjoys classics, especially Orwell's other novels, and books about politics and intrigue.5 stars for making my head explode."
2047,Katie Leonard,"I found I couldn't put his book down. It has such strong imagery and it's that vividness that really makes this such a disturbing idea. It doesn't matter that the time has long pasted with the new age of the internet, the themes are still relevant to our everyday lives. Winston's obsession with the truth and reality is so important these days were we can now, replace files and everything is changeable and mutable. It's quite heavy material and the ending (don't worry I'm not going to spoil it) leaves you feeling very displaced. Making you think very hard what you would do and then come to the horrid enviable conclusion that you would have done the same.I personally really enjoyed it. Certainly more of a plot and environment based tale than for character but I still feel that it was a strong book, it just depends on your preference. I would recommend to anyone with open mind who doesn't shy away from the dark realities of life. In this culture of surveillence we have today, just remember:BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU"

2054,JasonS,"1984 by George Orwell is a dystopian novel that was published in 1949. It takes place in the year of 1984, in what we would today call London, England (in the novel, London is called London, but England is called Airstrip One, and Airstrip One is itself a province of Oceania, one of the world's superstates). The main character is a man named Winston Smith, a worker at the Ministry of Truth (Minitrue), where he alters, destroys, or creates historical records to coincide the recorded history with the past that the Party (the ruling governmental structure in Oceania) wants to exist at that time (e.g., if the Party wanted someone to never have existed, all mentions of that particular person on record would be permanently destroyed, and new records without mention of that person would be produced). Winston secretly despises the Party. He meets a woman named Julia, who also despises the Party, contrary to Winston's initial impression, and they begin a supposedly covert and illicit relationship. However, they are found out, and the Party manages to ""re-educate"" him to love and follow the Party and Big Brother (the possibly nonexistent leader of the Party).I find this book to be full of ideas that are extremely thought-provoking and relevant, both in the past and in the present. For example, Orwell writes about how the Party can control reality by manipulating the perception of the general population and modifying existing records at will. A good portion of the Ministry of Truth is dedicated to the alteration of historical records. Winston once had to edit an announcement from Big Brother because it praised a certain Comrade Withers whose organization was dissolved later, thus shaming him. The Party also educates the population in deluding themselves into believing whatever it is necessary for the Party to have them believe (whether it is that black is white or that 2+2=5). This particular behavior of self-delusion is referred to as doublethink, where a person can both believe and disbelieve something at the same time (e.g., a person can believe that black is white when black needs to be white, and that black is black when black needs to be black). Orwell also happened to write 1984 as a warning as to where he thought the world could be heading: a world where there is no absolute ""truth"". Another thing the book mentions is that the world had the technology to make everyone happier and give everyone a better life, yet people who wanted power (power is apparently better than utopia) realized that if everyone was equal in wealth and education, than they would realize that the ruling class was unnecessary and would overthrow the ruling class. Thus the people who wanted to be rulers and the rulers themselves decided to waste the technology by creating things that would supposedly benefit a war effort, in order to keep the non-ruling classes with less wealth and less education.I recommend this book to most teenagers and all adults. I would not recommend this book to anyone not in at least 6th or 7th grade because they would lack the necessary comprehension to grasp all of the ideas and concepts inherent in the novel. I would recommend the book to (almost) all people at least in the 9th grade and above because they would have the aforementioned comprehension, or enough of it. Many ideas and concepts are interwoven together in this book, and they are worth the time to learn about and contemplate, if not to investigate further."

2057,Eugene Meyer,"George Orwell strikes again! After reading Animal Farm, I knew that whatever was in this book was going to be good and make you think and attempt to contemplate what emotions both you and Winston Smith feel. To be totally honest, I thought of this to be a futuristic society with lasers and cool guards, almost like the Hunger Games trilogy. I was TOTALLY WRONG, but I am glad I was. This dystopian society, Oceania, is one of three, with Eurasia and Eastasia as the other two. The principles of Ingsoc are similar but ""different"" in all of the superstates. (If you are interested or read the book and are confused, go to the back of the book to fully understand what it is) The concept of never being able to think or speak out or really do anything that the Party does not want to you to is insane, especially living in America where these freedoms are undervalued. I was enveloped in the book from the love affair with Julia to the (view spoiler)[imprisonment of Winston and reprogramming so that he would be corrected (hide spoiler)]. Ingsoc is pretty much English Socialism, and the principles of Newspeak and how an entire language could be adjusted to fit its needs. All the rich vocabulary is being eliminated and simplified. Your brain might hurt after reading this book, but the book needs to be re-read to fully run through what happens and how some of these seemingly insane ideas are coming true today. A must-read 5/5. A need-to-read-in-your-lifetime book."
2058,J G,If you have gone this long in your life and have not read this book. Then pick up a copy or steal one. This is a fundamental book for both Fiction and Non Fiction lovers
2059,John Sloan,"Terrific, also scary, i can see why this has gained the reputation it has. was disappointed in the sad ending, though i suppose this was necessary for a dystopian story. Winston was truly a character that it was easy to relate to and you put yourself in his place easily. The romance was very good, although sad that in the end “the party” destroyed their love as well as everything else. i liked how “the book” was set up as an amazing and wise and sacred book. but was then totally brought down as a fake in the end."
2060,Omar Dzinic,Perfect. A fiction that reads like history and mirrors the current state of totalitarian approaches by many governments.

Эхнээс нь л номондоо их орж уншсан бололтой уншаад хэд хоночихоод байхад хүртэл уур хүрээд байх юм. Хүн тийм нөхцөл байдалд орохоороо үнэхээр л тэгэж өөрчлөгддөг юм байхдаа гэж бодогдоод.... Их юм бодогдуулсан даа.Энэ номон дээр гарч байгаа нийгэм бол үнэн айдас төрмөөр хэзээ ч хүсэлтгүй тийм аймшигтай. Тэгээд тэр намаас авч байгаа арга хэмжээнүүд нь бас айхтар шүү.Тэр намын гол санаа үзэл баримтлал энэ тэр бол хэлэх ч юм биш пөөөх, арай ч дээ, яагаад, юу гэсэн үг вэ гэсэн асуулт бодлууд хөврөөстэй л уншсан даа. 1984с үнэхээр айхтар гэж бодсон нэлээн хэдэн үзэл санаанууд байснаас хэдийг дурьдая гэж бодлоо.Эхлээд newspeak байна. Одоохондоо Oceana-д одоогоор newspeak-г бүрэн эхээр нь хэрэглэж эхлээгүй байгаа хэдий ч бүрэн эхээр нь боловсруулж дуусгаад албан ёсны хэл болчихвол хүн гэдэг чинь албан ёсоор амьтантай нэг алхамаар ойртож ирж байгаа юм даа. Яагаад гэхээр newspeak-т ямар ч нэг зүйлийг илэрхийлсэн олон янзын үг гэж байхгүй. Нийт үгийн тоо байж болох хамгийн бага хэмжээндээ хүрнэ.

Үүний гол үзэл санаа нь аливаа үг хоёр утгатайгаар хэрэглэгдэж байгаа юм. Тиймээс нам хүссэн үедээ тухай үгийг аль утгаар нь хэрэглэгдэхийг нь шийдэхэд л болохоо болж байгаа юм. Аймар байгаа юм шүү.

2062,David Russo,"This book was awsome. From beginning to end, Orwell does an incredible job of depicting a future in which there exists not a harmonios utopia, but a world in which all life is controlled by governmental forces of opression, a chilling world where all motive, thought, act of commerce, and even emotion is regulated by ""Big Brother"". ""Big Brother,"" the foremost entity representing Oceania, one of three supernations remaining after a devastating communist revolution that occurred throughout the world, controls every aspect of the main protagonist's life, Wilson Smith. From his thoughtlife (the kidnappings of mental malefactors by the thought police) to his linquistic repetoire (NewSpeak, a language manufactured and sanctioned by the State, devoid of creativity, short and efficent in form and purpose, to the history that he reads and knows about the world that existed before the rise of ""Big Brother"" and the one ruling Party (the government also erases any historical facts that create discrepancies within and between messages of state dogma). Any sign of deviation from pure adoration of ""Big Brother"" is censured severly, and those caught seeking freedom from such a sterilized and controlling society are never seen again. Wilson decides to resist, and in the end, is tranformed radically by his struggles. This book allowed me to understand that liberties, both personal and civil, must be protected dearly, and that freedom is a fragile and delicate endowment presented to mankind, and as such, must be protected at all times."
2063,camila," ""La Guerra es Paz, La libertad la esclavitud y la ignorancia es Fuerza""1984 hace parte de las distopías clásicas mas aclamadas en la literatura universal; Ya son mas de 50 años desde publicación y cada vez la similitud con la realidad va incrementando. Yo lo considero como una metáfora de la actualidad, gran parte de la población es victima de un horizonte mental de su propia ignorancia y ni ellos mismos se dan cuenta.Winston Smith es el gran protagonista martirizado por el gobierno totalitarista que oprime la libertad de los habitantes observando cada movimiento, nadie se salva de la omnipresencia del Gran Hermano, todas las calles, hogares, paredes, muros, en los billetes y relojes todos con el mismo rostro del enemigo del Estado acompañado de un eslogan que dice ""El Gran Hermano te vigila"" seguidamente la ciudad esta rodeada por cantidades de telepantallas que es por donde los partidarios pueden observar a las personas. Un mundo caótico atestado con las peores reglas y un régimen casi absurdo pero muy revelador en esta reseña pretendo dar a conocer las crudas características de la novela pero aun asi la hacen un gran libro y tambien argumentar porque es un espejo de la realidad. Winston es un gran personaje principal que es capaz de desafiar el trastornado universo que lo ataca, el muchacho odia a la figura omnipresente, tiene grandes deseos de escapar de la guerra a pesar de saber que es imposible porque la sociedad esta dividida en tres grandes potencias: Oceanía, Eurasia y Asia Oriental que permanecen en constante conflicto por sus ideologías políticas y permanecer en el poder. Otro dato que no se me puede escapar es la brecha que separa las decadencias económicas, están los ""Altos"" que tienen influencias burocráticas y poseen permiso de apagar las telepantallas cuando estos lo deseen, por otros lado confluyen los ""medios"" que tienen una estabilidad económica relativamente normal pero no tienen los mismos privilegios que los altos y finalmente los ""Proles"" que tienen escasos recursos y tienen prohibida la intimidad, están vigilados por doquier y se constituyen por telepantallas en su al rededor. Ademas de todo lo mencionado, falta resaltar que los ministerios hacen parte del funcionamiento de esta sociedad, se encuentra el Ministerio de Verdad que se encarga de las noticias, espectáculos y demas actividades, sigue el Ministerio del Amor que rige las leyes, el Ministerio de Abundancia y el Ministerio de la Paz que se encarga de las guerras.Pero eso no es nada ahora viene lo mas sorprendente de toda la novela y es la Neolengua el idioma oficial de Oceanía es algo dificil de explicar pero es algo intrínseco en la obra y la forma en que funciona es impresionante. La Neolengua tiene como objetivo privatizar el conocimiento, embrutecer a las personas, limitar el pensamiento, desaparecer palabras fuertes o que expongan un significado negativo y propagar la ignorancia para todos los ciudadanos, ¿que significa que esto? que las palabras como ""Revolución"", ""desacuerdo"", ""Pelea"", ""libertad"", entre este tipo de léxico esta totalmente fuera del vocabulario de las personas, esto quiere decir que no pueden protestar en contra del partido político ni oponerse una forma muy eficaz de lavar el cerebro. La ultima palabra puede usarse pero de un modo diferente, por ejemplo: ""El pero esta libre de piojos"" o ""El césped esta libre de sucios"", en oraciones muy básicas y cotidianas, que no aporten un contexto en contra de alguien. En el caso de palabras como ""malo"" se dice ""Inbueno"" se incluye un prefijo y el antónimo, todo esto con el fin de tener un vocabulario muy corto y estrecho en intelecto.Tanto es el temor de ser inteligentes hasta pensar es una acción vigilada, denominada como ""crimental"", donde la policía del pensamiento puede llegar adentrarse en tu mente y si ellos perciben cualquier signo de odio contra las campañas políticas, te ""vaporizan"" para no decir la palabra ""matar"", porque no les conviene tener personas con algo de conocimiento, son los auténticos espías.Ahora la similitud que tiene con la actualidad es el simple hecho de que la humanidad esta embrutecida por esas ""cosas"" que según ellos los hace ""felices"" pero en realidad son victimas de su ignorancia y ni saben, todo el fútbol, la farándula, la television basura y música comercial contribuyen a limitar el intelecto entre los ciudadanos, cuando pierde un equipo deportivo se limitan a llorar y no se lamentan por cosas realmente importantes como las situaciones del ambiente o problemáticas de la sociedad en ámbitos de educación o pobreza, tampoco se les pasa por la cabeza leer un libro, solo piensan en cosas sin sentidos. La novela es un espejo a lo que estamos viviendo y quizá muchos no tienen ni la menor idea de lo que esta sucediendo. Por otro lado, las neolenguas buscan limitar el léxico, ¿que pasa ahora mismo? son las mismas cuatro y cinco palabras que utilizamos, solo que aplicamos sinónimos y no nos damos cuenta, puede llegar a ser involuntario pero al menos ciertas personas se preocupan por tener un buen vocabulario y no pasar por ignorantes pero otros, ni lo meditan.En conclusión, es uno de mis libros favoritos, me encanto como se refleja la sociedad y todos los disturbios y constantes luchas que vive Winston sirven como reflexión y aprendizaje, me falto mencionar mas personajes como Julia, Syme, O'brien o Parsons, pero eso mejor lo dejo para que lo lean y no adelantar mucho. Es impresionante la forma en la que Orwell narra la cruda y espeluznante realidad, la depresión que inunda esa sociedad, 1984 es una visión a lo que ocurre en nuestra realidad. "
2064,Evan Edinger,"This was such a thrilling read! I had heard so much about this book as it's probably one of the most talked-about classics on my list, but I missed out on this in high school. Definitely worth the read! So many terms from this book are used in the media nowadays. Doublethink really got into my head hahaha. Big Brother is love. Big Brother is life."
2065,Khalid AlHaqqan,تجدون رأيي في مدونتيhttp://kuwson.blogspot.com/2009/06/19...
2066,Noora,"1984 is so brilliant and cynical and astonishing and truly mind-boggling. I am in awe of George Orwell for creating a meticulous yet completely comprehensible system of government, and the way with which he constructs this novel. It is a classic for a reason. The slow build of the story really requires your full attention, but taking your time with this is oh so worth it. I think I can now confidently say that Orwell is one of my favourite authors of all time. "
2067,Jwm,"Orwell simply got two things wrong:1. The year.2. That the government would have to lift a finger. We've done it to ourselves, willingly."
2068,Marta,"http://rosadeldeserto.weebly.com/linc...Se devo essere sincera in un primo tempo non volevo recensire questo libro, o meglio, dare una mia opinione a riguardo. Non è un romanzo facile da analizzare, ma poi ho voluto provarci e spero che i miei pensieri non risultino errati o confusi.Era da molto tempo che avevo voglia di leggere questo romanzo. L'ho preso in prestito ma è rimasto mesi in silenzio sulla mensola, fino a quando non sono rimasta ammaliata dalla sua voce, e non ho potuto resistere oltre.Mi aspettavo un romanzo difficile da leggere, invece, nonostante parlasse di temi importanti, è scritto in maniera semplice, con uno stile fluido che ti trascina nella lettura ed è difficile bloccarsi. Questo è sicuramente un aspetto che ho molto apprezzato ma, in verità, ho amato questo libro anche se mi ha lasciato dentro emozioni molto negative: angoscia, paura, rassegnazione, tristezza e incredulità.Sì, perché non è un romanzo facile. Non c'è allegria e anche quel filo di speranza che sembra per un attimo illuminare la trama, si spegne del tutto.In realtà, soprattutto nella terza parte, mi sono sentita soffocare, avevo lo stomaco sottosopra, sconvolto. Pagine e pagine di ripetizioni che descrivono perfettamente il mondo futuro immaginato da Orwell.«Ci incontreremo là, dove non c'è tenebra.»1984 è un romanzo distopico ambientato in un futuro in cui il mondo è suddiviso in tre immensi superstati sempre in lotta tra loro: l'Oceania, l'Eurasia e l'Estasia. La trama però si svolge in Oceania, la cui capitale è Londra e la cui società è governata secondo i principi del Socing, e guidata dal Grande Fratello (o Fratello Maggiore) che tutto vede e tutto sente. Nessuno sa chi sia veramente, ma è possibile notare il suo volto e i suoi occhi sempre fissi sui cittadini, nei grandi manifesti in giro per la città. Grandi teleschermi sempre accesi controllano la vita di tutti, i tuoi pensieri, le tue azioni, e il braccio armato, la cosiddetta Psicopolizia, è pronto ad intervenire in caso si commetta uno psicoreato.Apparentemente non ci sono leggi scritte, occorre rispettare però tre slogan presenti ovunque:LA GUERRA È PACE.LA LIBERTA' È SCHIAVITU'.L'IGNORANZA È FORZA.Tre dettami che, a mio avviso, incutono già una certa angoscia.Il protagonista è Winston Smith, un uomo che lavora al Ministero della Verità, in cui si occupa di modificare le notizie dei giornali, a seconda dei pensieri del Partito. Altri tre Ministeri gestiscono la società: Il Ministero dell'Abbondanza responsabile per gli affari economici, il Ministero della Pace che si occupa della guerra, e il Ministero dell'Amore, il più terribile, che mantiene la legge e l'ordine pubblico. Nomi assurdi per i loro veri scopi.Il mondo in cui vive Smith appare cupo e triste. Tutti sono chiamati a vivere allo stesso modo, senza nutrire forti emozioni, come l'amore; sono chiamati ad avere lo stesso pensiero, quello del Grande Fratello, e ad amarlo nonostante tutto. Sembrano quasi come dei non uomini, dei burattini, pronti ad eseguire ciò che viene impartito loro. Dei giocattoli vuoti privi di emozioni, di pensieri, di opinioni personali. Non esistono rapporti. Si compiono atti sessuali solo per procreare. I bambini sono spesso le spie contro i loro genitori. La guerra è perenne, la fame persistente. Insomma, un mondo che sin dalle prime pagine soffoca, fa male, colpisce veramente cuore e stomaco.In questo ambiente, però, succede qualcosa di strano nel nostro protagonista: lui inizia a domandarsi cosa ci fosse stato prima. Come era Londra prima del Grande Fratello? Come si viveva prima? Il mondo era sempre stato così? Ed è nel momento in cui inizia a pensare e ad amare la bella Julia, che qualcosa si risveglia in lui. Smith comincia ad essere un uomo, con i propri pensieri, le proprie emozioni, un amore intenso. E scaturisce in lui la voglia di scontrarsi contro quel partito, di lottare per andare contro il Grande Fratello verso il quale nutre un sincero odio.Smith inizia ad intuire che forse la rivoluzione può venire dai prolet, se solo iniziassero a capire l'importanza di una tale iniziativa. Quel mondo di persone lasciate a se stesse.Per un attimo, quindi, si avverte una flebile speranza. Una volontà di cambiare la triste situazione. Di sovvertire le regole. Di colpire al cuore il Grande Fratello e ribellarsi a una società dittatoriale che annulla l'uomo.Fino a quando... qualcosa si spegne. Julia e Winston vengono sorpresi dalla psicopolizia e portati al Ministero dell'Amore.Torture fisiche e mentali. Lavaggi di Cervello. Tormento.Entrambi vengono come ripuliti dalle loro idee. Svuotati dei loro sentimenti e dei loro pensieri. Rimodellati secondo le regole del Partito.Eppure, Winston per un attimo sembra resistere, ma, perdonate lo spoiler, quella terribile stanza 101 sarà la fine anche della speranza.Quando ti minacciano di farti cose a cui non puoi resistere, che non vuoi nemmeno immaginare, diventa facile tradire e rinunciare. Abbattersi completamente. Ma è la frase finale che colpisce senza pietà.Sicuramente molti di voi avranno letto questo libro. Probabilmente lo avrete compreso meglio di me e ne avrete parlato anche meglio.Io non so se le mie parole siano confuse o meno, ma quello che posso tornare a ribadire è che questa lettura mi ha sconvolta parecchio.È un romanzo che si legge facilmente ma anche con la dovuta attenzione a ogni singolo dettaglio. Un romanzo che fa riflettere e che può essere paragonato anche alla nostra realtà.Questi bombardamenti di messaggi fuorvianti, questa volontà di annullare l'individuo, di spegnere i pensieri e le emozioni, è accaduto all'epoca di Orwell (e infatti, da quel che ho letto è un puro attacco a Stalin e Hitler) ma, in un certo senso, succede anche ora. Dittature che impediscono la libertà di stampa e di pensiero ci sono anche ora, credo. Ci sono realtà spregevoli dove non ci si può amare.E... l'ignoranza è il modo più efficace per un governo di imporsi sui cittadini. In fondo chi non legge, chi non si informa, chi non sa, è più orientato a credere alle balle raccontate da un partito. Così come i cittadini del mondo raccontato in 1984. Tutti credono che il Grande Fratello abbia ragione, che sia da amare, che ogni cosa che viene detta e urlata attraverso quei teleschermi sia pura realtà. Non importa se muta ogni volta. Non importa se l'Oceania era in guerra con l'Eurasia e poi con l'Estasia. Se il Grande Fratello dice che è sempre stata in guerra con uno dei due stati, questa è verità.Non è triste tutto ciò?Immensamente triste.Tutto il romanzo è impregnato di pessimismo, di quell'impossibilità di rivoltarsi. Tutti sono controllati, anche di notte: se parli nel sonno rischi di essere preso e torturato, di compiere un delitto terribile.Una società dove non puoi amare, pensare, riflettere, è terribile.Insomma, tirando le somme, è un romanzo che DEVE essere letto. Un romanzo scorrevole ma che lascia molte sensazioni negative addosso. Perlomeno, così mi è successo. Mi ha lasciato inquietudine, angoscia, soffocamento. Sensazioni difficili da mandar via.La terza parte, in particolare, è un vero e proprio pugno nello stomaco. L'abilità di Orwell nel descrivere le torture psichiche e fisiche è sorprendente. Mi sembrava di essere in quelle celle, e sentire quei sgradevoli odori. Quegli individui magri e impauriti. Quei segni terribili di torture. Quegli strumenti macabri che portano l'uomo ad annullarsi completamente.Terribile. Davvero.Eppure proprio per questo sento che sia uno dei romanzi più belli, meritevole del massimo dei voti.Insomma se non lo avete ancora fatto, leggetelo.Se lo avete già letto, spero che le mie parole non siano state errate. Ma, è un mio pensiero, e io mi lascio andare sempre dalle mie emozioni, più che su aspetti tecnici o altro. "
2069,Yue,"WAR IS PEACE. SLAVERY IS FREEDOM. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.What? you're probably thinking to yourself. What are you talking about? What kind of nonsensical babble are you speaking of? They're opposites of each other, gosh darn it! It's a lie. It's all a LIE.Well, you passionately confused person, I'm talking about 1984 by George Orwell, aka one of the finest dystopian fiction ever written. You think that all they do is take love from you? You think that all they do is seperate you into faction? Do you really think that there's (view spoiler)[some kind of a happy ending?
(hide spoiler)]Hah. Aren't you cute. No, this book is depressing as hell. It's weird as hell in some parts. But here's the thing: George Orwell is right. It's haunting. Do you really want to live in that kind of society? Where your thought is monitored, too?This book was also uber fun to analyze. Look: Yep, someone had a lot of fun.(And I wasn't even finished with the book when I took the picture)"
2070,Luccas Shang,"I found 1984 to be an intriguing and insightful dystopian novel about the society and consequences of totalitarianism. The book takes place in a war-torn world reduced to three super-states, all following their own form of autocracy. I found it remarkably interesting as to how this book is what the author pictured the future, and how there some parallels even today. George Orwell uses a similar satirical approach in this story as he did in his previous work Animal Farm. I will admit, I myself found this novel challenging and difficult to understand, as this book may be considered far above my skill level. I urge all people to read this and to enjoy if for themselves."

2075,Rich Meyer,"What can you say about this one? It's really the ultimate dystopian novel - the one against all others should be judged. Most everything that needs to be said or experienced about the genre can be garnered by reading this and Huxley's Brave New World. Both books are somewhat prophetic, but 1984 hits far too closely on many marks with current society. Oceania is a world where power and control are the only things that really give The Powers That Be any sort of satisfaction, and the deprivation of the working class is the means of getting that. If you haven't read this book, you need to read it. And soon, before it becomes more of a historical document than a novel. And before it disappears..."
2076,Erik Graff," In 1962 Mother took little brother Fin and me by freighter and airplanes to visit her parents and siblings in Norway. The visit, lasting the summer, was extremely memorable. Her parents lived in a two-flat near the new campus of the University of Oslo, on the outskirts of the capital. That was our base between visits to other relations. In this residential neighborhood, shopping was done at the roundabout of the tram line leading downtown. There was a small library located on the island so formed, a library with a shelf or two of English language books. On a first visit, I picked 1984 as I was already a science fiction fan and had heard of it. Since then, of course, I've seen the Burton version of it on video, but haven't read it since. Memories of the actual novel are therefore sketchy. Naturally, as a ten year old, the sex scenes were quite interesting, but not attractive. Indeed, the whole novel was dark and depressing like the attic at my grandparents' where I slept, like the scars of the world wars which I had seen flying from Bremen to Copenhagen, like what the media said again and again about the threats of Communism and of nuclear war. "
2077,Jennifer,Something everyone should read. Creepy yet believable. I really liked it in a creeped out kind of way.
2078,Yong Jee,"The story starts off by ten non related people that receives a letter that says each of them are invited to an Island. And then, all of the ten people accept the invitation and arrive to the isolated Indian Island. They go into the huge mansion and enjoys a great dinner with the new people. During the dinner, a guest, Anthony, suddenly chokes and dies. In the next morning, one guest’s wife didn’t awake. People start to suspect that the deaths are no longer an accident, but a planned murder. I recommend this book to people who enjoy reading suspense and mystery. It is a very thrilling book, and makes the readers to not stop reading. I give this book a 5, because the ending was very unexpected and shocking."
2079,Hamidur Rahman,"Big Brother is God. No, I do not mean that because I was brainwashed by the Ministry of Love. Someone who can see you at every moment, someone who can hear your voice all the time, someone who knows what you're doing at every single moment, someone who wants you to love him unconditionally, someone who wants you to submit to his ideology without doubting or questioning or even thinking about doubting it, someone who can judge you while you dream, someone who doesn't want you to have sexual relationships without being married, and someone who will never die, is God. But that is also Big Brother. It is redundant to say what I said because religions are (at least most of them), in their core, totalitarian. The late Christopher Hitchens once subtly mentioned Big Brother while comparing religious people's way of referring everything ""to a totalitarian judgement, to an absolute monarch.""One more thing that I kept thinking about was how true 1984 actually came to be. Not much, for the modern world really. I don't buy the arguments that the NSA can check our phones, computers, emails, and Facebook. Yes, they can and they probably do but we all have the choice of not using any of those. The people of Oceania didn't have that choice. They had no way of getting out of the sight of the telescreens. Big Brother was omnipresent. But I cannot deny that some of it actually did come true, albeit not in the same degree.Ministry of Love's torture is comparable to the Guantanamo Bay's treatment of prisoners. The continuous warfare is evident in the USA's involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, although I think this is just a coincidence. But the violation of freedom of speech is evident in countries where religion dictates the laws of the country. Take for example the people in Saudi Arabia or Iran who tweeted blasphemous remarks about Muhammad or Allah. We all know their fates. Even in a country where religion isn't that much of a factor in state laws, sometimes it can raise its ugly venomous head. Take for example Bangladesh, a country where secularism was one of the four basic ideals of the constitution (that was abolished later when some idiots who became leaders decided to make Islam the state religion). In 2007, a leading newspaper in the country published a cartoon in its supplemental magazine. The cartoon was about a guy asking a child what's his name. The child told the guy his name but the guy said that he should add Muhammad in front of his name because he is a Muslim. The guy then proceeds to ask the child what's the name of his cat and he replied Muhammad cat or something similar. I doubt the writer had any intention of insulting Muhammad. I'm pretty sure the cartoonist was also a Muslim. So, what happened, you ask? Well, the cartoonist was imprisoned, the editor had to publicly apologize, and the government banned the highly popular magazine. The reason was for ""hurting religious sentiments.""It is all bits and pieces that came true. It makes you wonder if theocratic states like Saudi Arabia or Iran actually had technologies like the telescreens through which they could monitor the activities of people 24/7, what would they do? What would happen if they could know your thoughts? Would a slight deviation from the Islamic law be punished? Would they punish you for thoughtcrime? Does apostasy count as a thoughtcrime? Because essentially, you are thinking and making a conscious decision to abandon a faith and choose another way of life. If it does, then people are already being punished for ""thoughtcrime,"" we just don't call it by that name.This perhaps wasn't a coherent argument but I tried to share what I thought were some similarities. But perhaps I am underscoring Orwell's writing abilities by talking about the similarities and not mentioning how much of a well-written book this is. It's a brilliant piece of writing that warns us of a dystopian society where totalitarianism breaks apart individuality. Where a human being is reduced to a mere number: ""6079 Smith W."" A brilliant political novel as well as the exploration of the effects of language on our thoughts and the ramifications of psychological manipulation. The afterword precisely summarizes this book with a single question: Can human nature be taken out of humans so that they forget their longing for love, for freedom, for solidarity—which is to say, they forget that they are humans? The answer, Orwell says, is yes."
2080,stephanie,"you can't say you're well-read until you've read this. i mean, come on, julia, winston, the rats, and DOUBLETHINK and DOUBLESPEAK and NEWSPEAK and the way history can be manipulated. i think it was perhaps reading what winston's job was that first stimulated my interest in history - which, history and memory man, here i am. brilliant book, kind of a thriller, and yet a scathing remark on society - even more pertintent so long after 1984.

2081,Otherwyrld,"I'm not sure what to say about this book, except that I can see why it is a classic. The whole totalitarian regime of Big Brother, at the same time both totally banal and totally terrifying, has so many resonances with the modern day that it is scary how closely the author was able to predict what was going on. There are a few occasions when 1984 slips back into 1948, with the use of terms and phrases that seem archaic now, but these moments are few enough and disappear entirely in the latter part of the book. I did have a few problems with the misogyny of the main character (and by implication, that of the author), but this is swept aside in the powerhouse of the final part. I think I found this book so deeply disturbing because at heart I am a conformist, and I can easily picture myself doing all the things that the people in this book have to do to survive (though they are existing rather than surviving). That's not an easy thing to admit, especially as I would also consider myself middle class, just the type of person who is most downtrodden in this book. The lower class, the proles, have a relatively easy time of it living in ignorant bliss with their beer and their mindless entertainment (much like quite a lot of people do today, all you have to do is look around you to see that the proles are already here). The upper class, the ones in power, will do anything to stay in power, as the section of the rebel book that Winston Smith reads out loud makes clear (and here again we can see current day examples, with the spin doctors and career politicians who ""run"" our countries).In the end, this book is frightening realistic and perhaps we all have a part to play in not letting something like this actually happen. Big Brother is not watching us, we are Big Brother."

2083,ياسمين ثابت,بداية معرفتي بجورج اورويل كانت في رواية مزرعة الحيواناتماعجبتنيش بسبب توقيت قرايتها ولما حصل 30 \6 واللي حصل بعدها عجبتني اوي وحسيتها بتوصف بالضبط اللي احنا بنمر بيهبس كانت مجرد رواية

2084,Blake,"Some times, the oldest books are the best ones. 1984 paints a vivid image of the year 1984 as George Orwell saw it in 1949. Written in 3rd person, the book follows the life of Winston Smith, an average citizen of Oceania, one of three super powers that consists of Australia, America, England, South Africa, Greenland, and Iceland. Winston lives in London, or what once was London at least. Living in a communist society, Winston secretly harbors hatred towards the inner party, whom control everything in their world; the amount of food, supplies, your job, your family, even your ideals and beliefs. They monitor everything via giant telescreens and hidden microphones, even when one is in their own home. ""It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away...Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your nervous system. At any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom” (62-63). As Winston attempts to find the Brotherhood, a secret group that apposes the Party, the reader learns more and more about Orwell’s prophetic, nightmarish vision of the future. Winston is an average member of society in 1984. He is thirty-nine, frail and thin, and a worker at the Ministry of Truth. Winston’s work consists of rewriting the past; He takes past news stories, and rewrites them to agree with The Party’s current political standings. A common example being, if Oceania were to suddenly go to war with Eastasia, when they were allied with them yesterday, all historical documents containing evidence to the contrary would be altered by the workers at the Ministry of Truth. ""Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct; nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and re-inscribed exactly as often as was necessary."" (34). As such a worker, and as someone who was alive before the Party came to power, Winston has developed suspicion as to many of their falsified statistics. Despite following the Party’s solution to this, known as doublethink, He still wishes for a return to the way the world was before the party came into power, and so begins a search for the brotherhood, an underground organization that directly apposes the party in any way it can. Orwell doesn’t waste time. His books are always just as long as they need to be, no more and no less. And so characters develop quickly. Their basic description and ideals are laid out quickly, and expanded upon only when major events occur in the plot line. But despite that, Orwell manages to shock the reader by bringing back many snippets of conversations, or even minor characters that readers overlook in their first reading: “He was still recognizable, but he was not the same person any longer. His body had straightened, and seemed to have grown bigger. His face had undergone only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformation. The black eyebrows were less bushy, the wrinkles were gone, the whole lines of the face seemed to have altered; even the nose seemed shorter. It was the alert, cold face of a man about five-and-thirty. It occurred to Winston, that for the first time in his life, he was looking, with knowledge, at a member of the Thought Police” (224). Throughout the events of 1984, Winston comes to understand the how, and eventually the why, behind the Party’s actions. “We control life Winston, on all its levels. You are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us. But we create human nature. Men are infinitely malleable” (269). Winston learns the true nature of the Party, and is deeply sickened. But the Party has terrifying methods of inspiring obedience, as Winston soon finds out. “You asked me once, what was in Room 101. I told you that you knew the answer already. Everyone knows it. The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thing in the world” (282). Winston’s mental willpower and will to survive are direly tested by the Party, easily forming the event that shapes the person he is by the end of the book.From the first sentence, to the last four words, 1984’s terrifying reality is mirrored in our own world in many ways, and is a must read for anyone whom wishes to better understand the motivation behind the governments of our world."
2085,Ana Méndez,"Increible libro. Desde que empecé a leerlo supe que no me iba a durar mucho tiempo... la historia me gustó, el final no me lo esperaba.Tiene muchas cosas muy interesantes, en cuanto a la privacidad, a la manipulación de las masas, la concentración del poder y la ambición. La edición que leí tenía también un afterword escrito por Erich Fromm que valió la pena leer también."
2086,ThinkPol,"my opinion on nineteen eighty-four should be self-explanatory by my profile name.god damn it, more people should read this fucking book. they also should read animal farm, homage to catalonia, and a brave new world (the latter by aldous huxley, a separate writer), but this book first and foremost! it's a good introduction into dystopic literature, a north korea-lite (or to be more precise, DPRK itself is actually 1984-lite). a bleak future, best described as a boot stomping on human face--forever, where the Party controls the future, the present, the past, and alters reality under its whim.I haven't yet to read the Indonesian translation, so I have no idea how well Newspeak translates to Indonesian. it's freaking awesome in the book. Orwell has an appendix in the end dedicated to describe this new English, where critical thinking (or thinking in general) is eliminated and language is merely a means of duckspeak. A perfect tool for perfect dictators ala Big Brother and his Inner Party.4.9/5, long live Orwell o> o>"
2087,Harmish,Do not read this until you want to depress yourself with the truth of how your society is going to become
2088,Robert,"Single handedly the most wonderful, and most horrible book I've ever read. "
2089,Owen Smith,"An amazing book, with an amazing storyline and plot. How the characters interact and betray each other, and how they change is done better by Orwell in 1984 than in any other book I have ever read. The last about 1/3 of the book is the best part in my opinion. The ending was better than anything anyone else could have thought of. The way this book is connected to the politics of that time, and even today's world, is also amazingly well in this book. I highly recommend reading this book to anyone who wants to get lost in an amazing futuristic world and hear one of the best stories of all time told by one of the best storytellers of all time. ""People simply disappeared, always during the night. Your name was removed from the registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, your one-time existence was denied and then forgotten."
2090,Farah,"رواية 1984 جورج أورويل..رواية سياسية تتحدث عن مجتمع قائم على القمع و الاستبداد..وهي عبارة عن تصور و تحذير من مستقبل وارد جداً حدوثه..أحداث الرواية تدور في دولة أوشيانيا حيث الأيدلوجية هناك هي الاشتراكية الإنجليزية أو ما يسميه الحزب الداخلي بـ (الإنجسوك), وحيث المجتمع هناك مقسم لثلاث طبقات: طبقة “الحزب الداخلي” ونسبتها اثنان بالمئة من السكان, وطبقة “الحزب الخارجي” ونسبتها ثلاثة عشرة بالمئة منهم, وأخيراً توجد طبقة “العامة”, وفوق هذه الطبقات كلها يوجد الحاكم المسيطر المستبد “الأخ الأكبر”؛ هذه الشخصية التي أصبحت من أكثر الشخصيات الروائية شهرة, بل إنها أصبحت رمزاً لأي عملية استبداد أو تجسس أو قمع.في أوشيانيا يستبد الحزب الداخلي بقيادة الأخ الأكبر استبداداً مذهلاً وجباراً على باقي الطبقات؛ فهو يزرع شاشات الرصد في كل مكان؛ وهذه الشاشات مهمتها مراقبة الشعب ونشر الأخبار الملفقة وإصدار الأوامر للأفراد, ويزرع الحزب الميكروفونات في كل مكان لرصد كل همسة من الشعب, بل ويتجاوز الحزب ذلك ويعمد لتحطيم العلاقات الأسرية لإفناء كل ولاء ليس موجه له, ويعمد أيضا لإذلال العملية الجنسية بجعلها مجرد وسيلة لخدمته وبتجريدها من أي رغبة أو وله أو عاطفة كوأد لأي احتمال لنشوء ولاء لغير الأخ الأكبر. ثم يتفوق الحزب في استبداده على نفسه ليصل لمرحلة الاستبداد العقلي فيسيطر على اللغة, ويدمر, ويعيد تركيب كلماتها, بل ويصنع لغة جديدة, ويمنع الاتصال بالحضارات الأخرى, ويحرّف التاريخ, ويلفّق الماضي, ويقلب الحقائق, حتى تتوه العقول فلا تجد إلا الحزب كحقيقة ثابتة تستطيع أن تؤمن بها.رواية أكثر من رائعة وهي تنطبق على واقعنا حالياً...سببت لي بعض الاكتئاب..لكنها بالفعل أجمل ما قرأت من روايات لحد الآن:)"
2091,Zainab Mirah,"War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. It's like these three phrases that The Party uses, summarize the entire book. Also, this is a frightening novel."
2092,Nick,"It feels awfully presumptuous to be reviewing a book that is one of the most famous pieces of dystopian literature yet penned, so rather than review it, I shall simply give my take on this dismaying portrayal of future Britain. It may sound flippant, but I was genuinely and significantly affected by this book. This novel ""bummed me out"" and for no fewer than three days I found myself somewhat listless and despondent. I'm not sure if it was the content that pressed so heavily upon me or the comparison of today's world against that of Orwell's mind, but something spoke to me in a very profound way. Living in these United States, I am afforded a set of human rights by the Constitution, however today's Britain affords its citizens no such luxury. I do not mean to paint Great Britain as some sort of oligarchical (or dare I say ""Orwellian"") super state, but the safeguards that prevent a disintegration of humanity in the United States are not present in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Every day in major British cities more cameras are installed and more privacy is removed from the populace. I may be seeing specters, but I do wonder what Orwell would have to say.This novel is hugely poetic and drastically depressing. It is not enough to simply tolerate the government, one must accept it, one must love it. Like Swift's A Modest Proposal the sentiments expressed are as poignant today as they were the day they were written, maybe even more so. One does not simply read this book, one feels it. The broken world in which Winston Smith lives becomes tangible. The helicopters and view screens cease to be elements of a story and start becoming the seeds of great and horrifying possibilities. It's hard to read, sorry, it's hard to feel, not because of inaccessible language, but because of sheer sentiment. This is one of my very favorite novels."
2093,Miquel Reina,"What to say about 1984? Well, for me it's one of the best novels that have been ever written. Now that youth adult dystopian novels like The Hunger Games, Divergent or Maze Runner have become best sellers, I encourage to all its readers to discover this wonderful jewel from where all these novels have been inspired and of course also to the rest of readers!!Spanish version:¿Què decir de 1984? Para mí es una de las mejores novelas que jamás se hayan esctrito. Ahora que las novelas juveniles de sociedades distopicas están tanto de moda, animaría a todos sus lectores a leer esta maravillosa joya de la que novelas como Divergente, los Juegos del Hambre o El corredor del laberinto beben para crear sus ideas de sociedades totalitarias. "
2094,Reading Corner,"This book was amazing, a definite must read and classic as there's nothing I can find to criticise. George Orwell's writing was beautifully descriptive with many memorable lines that continuously enhanced the quality of the book. One that stood out for me the most was the infamous slogan that the party used and was mentioned a lot, ""War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength."" This slogan introduces the first idea of doublethink and the nature of the party who control their people's way of thinking and outlook on life and the world.Big Brother, the party, the proles, Oceania and the rest of the world are genius ideas that are tied together perfectly, there's no confusion with any of them as all ideas are explained properly and we are supplied with just enough information. Big Brother is the leader of Oceania and dictates victory, loses etc. from the telescreen that watches it's party members with great vigilance, ensuring every action and thought is in line with their standards. Winston, the protagonist does not fall within this bracket as he experiences dubious thoughts that could cost him his life and he feels alone in his reason of thinking. He even goes as far as dangerously buying a diary from a prole shop and starts recording his different opinions and thoughts. Winston is a great character who has many attributes but just as many faults which are both developed as the novel progresses. Winston's development especially towards the end is an unexpected, shocking twist which is horrible in one sense but also fantastic in turns of unpredictability. The supporting characters are also written well with deep complexity and jaw-dropping personality U-turns.The brilliance of the dystopian setting comes hand in hand with the unique, compelling plot which draws you in from the first few pages. I loved where the story went and the struggles the characters endured to get there. This book, without a doubt deserves 5 stars as it contains an engrossing story, with in dept characters and a captivating world. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading."
2095,Lucian,""" To hang on from day to day and from week to week, spinning out a present that had no future, seemed an unconquerable instinct, just as one's lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available"". Amazing and frightening at the same time, 1984 makes you change the way you think about what true power, control and paranoia really means."

2097,Maria Ch,"I feel like with classic books, there is not really much to say that can be original or has not already been said about them. In any case, as this is my first encounter with this book, I will give my review nonetheless. I am astonished at how perspicacious and insightful George Orwell. He wrote a book about a dystopian future, creating and imagining a world that is not that different to our world today, more than half a century later. In the book he writes the manifestos of an oligarchy that controls the world he describes and the struggle of an individual to set himself free in such a world, simply by trying to hold on to his own thoughts and go against the thought control regime, while struggling to maintain his memory’s integrity and dispute the party’s offering of a past that is once again controlled and defined by them to serve its needs and propaganda. Sovereign thought is the greatest crime that can be committed, as the Party has built a fortification to eliminate free thinking to extend its control over humanity: starting by censoring and controlling press and then taking complete control of the supply and demand of its people. Even geography has succumbed to the political control of those in power and as a result the continents have been reduced to 3 new ones: Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia that are always at war with each other because once again this serves other purposes. Theoretically, a party that is in utter control of its people to the extent that they can control even their thoughts should have created a world that suffices in everything. Poverty, malnutrition, war and illiteracy should have been eliminated, but they are not, because even if the Party has everything available for its people, it does not give them everything as this annihilates a hierarchy that needs to be maintained. A part of the population needs to be illiterate, because only then they are not a threat and this is reinforced by the Party’s motto: Ignorance is Strength. This is true, the question is who is it strength for? The book starts with metafiction: its main character is writing a diary describing his dystopian reality for future generations to read and keep as proof of a past that existed. The difference between Orwell and his character Winston, is that the former predicts this dystopian future, while the latter describes it and simply wishes to document it. Winston lives in a world where the past is falsified to be accommodated to the convictions of the Party and the only way to have any control over the past is through memory that cannot be shared with others, which renders it unworthy as the past can be proved or exist through written records like history books or photographs and collective memory. If the party controls both, then the party controls the past that has shaped the present that contributes to the future. Individual memory does not matter, as the party has the power to annihilate and remove any individual like Winston from the past anyway.The extent of the foreshadowing and predictions happening in this book and how relevant some descriptions are is very astonishing. The influence of the book even until this day is evident in the use of the Party’s slogan ‘Big Brother is Watching You’ for a popular reality show. A lot of the younger generations are familiar with this slogan but for the wrong reasons. In my opinion, it would be a nice ironic touch would have been for the producers of the show to offer copies of this book to every contestant participating. Orwell’s theory on war, tv and how control of available material can be used as not just propaganda, but to control one’s way of thinking by limiting his available information, as well as the use of surveillance and the threat of it is incredibly insightful and ahead of his times. Even though the ending of the book is not optimistic and it does not really offer any way out, I think the essence and purpose of it was not to provide an emergency exit, but to be thought provoking therefore it has served its purpose.Truth is I have not been this excited about a book in ages and I had a very strong reaction to this that made me want to read every single line written by George Orwell so suffice to say I strongly recommend this book. "
2098,Rita,"
Over the summer I have read quite a few good books which may be on the 20th century side, but are quite the classics which give you a lot to think about. The first one I'll explore is George Orwell's eerie world of 1984. Although the actual year of 1984 was far from it (as much as my 1980s history knowledge goes), let us jump back in time...or in a way the future as this was written in...1948 or 49...I'm sure it was written in 1948 and published in 1949 since Orwell originally planned to name the book 1948 then just swapped the last two numbers...Anyway! On with the review!The Story - 5/5 stars:There are 3 parts to the book - the introduction, the rendezvous and the finale. Despite there not happening much (literally), the story still keeps you glued to the book.The introduction is just that - the part where Orwell entraps you in the world he envisioned and explains it. Albeit the confusing beginning, once you keep reading in for a few pages you begin to understand the gears of this chaotic dystopia. Orwell's slight obsession with communism (well more of him hating it, not in a good fanatical way) shines through here with the totalitarian setting. As we go along with the thought-rebellious (or 'thought-crime', perhaps? See what I did there? ...yeah, you're laughing...) Winston Smith, we discover an earth quite different from ours (or is it? *dun dun DUUN...I should get more serious, seriously..). But this is not just any world - this is a world which will, as they say, 'give you the chills'. There is no independence allowed and you are always watched (literally. Cameras everywhere! Did Orwell by any chance give creators of CCTV any ideas, I wonder...?). Either way, there is a lot of irony and a lot of hypocrisy (the Ministry of Peace dealing with the war? Classic..). It was a twisted world which was always at war with something, at least that is what all the citizens of Oceania are made to believe. It is but a world full of lies and terror as we find Winston Smith's job - falsifying the past. There are many more points I would like to make on world building, but that will come later.The rendezvous. It all begins with a love note and then we have a rebellious couple of Winston and Julia. Julia is quite the wicked wench and her impurity is just what draws Winston towards her. Most of this middle section is pretty much the development of their relationship, albeit quite a weak one based mostly on lust. But it does not end there. The so called Brotherhood, of whose existence no one is sure, apparently reveals themselves to Winston. This was a strong yet predictable move on Orwell's side. It is strong as we see a build up of resentment and rebelliousness within Winston towards the climax of the story. This very build up however is also what made it a predictable move. Not everything turns out as planned however and there comes one of the biggest plot twists I have seen, a disappointing one in terms of morals though.And so in the finale the loose ends are tied. The story is wrapped up nicely (not literally). The finale section is most likely one of the most dreadful couple of pages I have ever read. As strange as it sounds - good dreadful. The whole concept and situation was very frightening, despite you knowing you are perfectly safe within your own house/library/park/wherever you are reading. The entire time you are reading until the end and thinking 'It couldn't possibly become more horrifying', you then find out that Orwell has a nasty surprise up his sleeve for you. You could never be quite sure what was going to happen yet you still had hope. Orwell brilliantly ripped out that hope and trampled on it, leaving you with a heavy heart once you finish the story.The Characters - 3.5/5 stars:Winston: An interesting little fella who just happened to be the oddball in the most dangerous place to be an oddball - Orwell's 1984 universe. His hatred of the party is actually understandable and his intellect shines through to the reader. He has an open mind and knows when he is being fooled (mostly. If he knew all along, the ending wouldn't have been so tragic). Being the outer party member (in human language, we would refer to it as 'middle class'), he knows the ins and outs of the ministries (at least his own); he knows how he should behave and what to avoid. Keeping in mind what kind of a world he lives in, that is pretty amazing.Julia: A shallow little tart who hates the party as much, if not more, as Winston. Her shallowness was rather annoying what with her falling asleep on important philosophical lectures and discussions with Winston. Perhaps it is my memory which has been killed by time or was she not really introduced with a background story and why she hated the party? Oh there are plenty of reasons to hate it, but what was Julia's?Big Brother (although not really appearing): With all the given hints, it seems that this is just a fictitious figure of the party. It seems to me like Stalin left quite a mark on this character.O'Brien: Oh, holly macarena. Now this was a twisted character in more ways than one. I cannot honestly claim that I foresaw the plot twist on his sake, it was quite a shock for me as to who O'Brien was and his real purpose. As they say - it's always the quiet ones.Goldstein: Was this but another fictitious character with whom the party could diagnose traitors and offenders while also giving a common enemy? Orwell have left that a mystery, yet his style of gnashing your hope gives me the impression that Goldstein most likely was another fake enemy.The Others: Well these were just the minor characters. They were important in a way, and they were not. Mostly because a lot of them became 'unpersons'...Writer's Technique - 5/5 stars:Orwell's style is bleak and blunt (why am I thinking of knives now...?) so it goes without saying that this story's tone was perfect. The style created a depressing and hopeless atmosphere, perfectly reflecting Orwell's 1984 universe.Let us get to the world building then. The idea of falsifying the past is quite a scary one yet a realistic one. This was influenced of course with communist USSR under Stalin's tyranny. The way Orwell presented it however and the background stories he created almost made it his own creation. Many of Orwell's inspirations came from the same place such as the delusional and bizarre idea that 2+2=5. The way this view however was forced was indeed very scary. Orwell played his cards well in contrasting the calm demeanour of the torturer and the agonising prisoner who had to accept those views as one can take a certain amount of torture before actually wanting and beginning to see what his tormentor tried to make him see, even if it was complete baloney.A certain phrase however really shocked me to the core - ""You. Are. The. Dead."". I was amazed again and again at Orwell's masterful skill in creating shocking and smiting remarks which once in a while just hit you right in the...feels, I guess. I'm not sure how else to describe that.Overall - 5/5 stars:This is a very dark dystopia which gives you a lot to think about. It is a favourite type of book of mine - one that stimulates the brain and one that engraves deeply emotionally. Every time I think about this story, I still get the 'chills'. It was far from a 'pleasant read', but more of a very interesting read.To summarise:This is definitely not a book for children or those who love a good light-hearted novel with a good romance. I think I would even go as far as to categorise this in a way in the horror genre (as the last part of the book definitely qualifies for that). As I have mentioned before - this is a stimulating read so if you like these sorts of books, go ahead! Personally I have enjoyed it (but I am a very weird person).And so that is all~! Thank you so much for reading!Original review: 1984 Review on my Book Fox blog"
2099,Annie ,"For sometimes you may be fortunate enough to come across something that will not just inspire and hold sway for only a sheer flimsy swing of the pendulum, until the curtain is swept aside by a debonair ally. For Nineteen Eighty Four had such an elemental influence on me that I have not been able to formulate anything beyond a few garbled grunts of appreciation, even after years since I first picked this up. But armed with determination and a whole day ahead of me, paired with the bright prospect of endless cups of coffee from the spanking new coffee machine now gracing my kitchen, I urge my fingers to magically churn out something that might be to a crude degree intelligible of my deep and ardent admiration of Orwell and this masterpiece. Nineteen Eighty Four primarily tells the story of one man Winston Smith, a common two legged product, and launches him headlong into a totalitarian society that is governed by an almost mystical invisible force. Invisible because it is everywhere. From the oppressive posters of Big Brother staring down from every corner and turn of the alley, to the telescreens that cannot be switched off and is used perhaps as further instrument to spy on the residents. This world is a far cry from the known. It is divided into superpowers and Airstrip One is what used to be England, now forms the mainland of Oceania and is where the story takes place. The elite dictatorial oppressors of Oceania exercise an almost god like sway over the country, wherein they control not just the physical instruments of the society but also the psychological. So much so that thought is governed and any deviation from that prescribed by The Party is subject to execution. Minute inflexions in facial expressions and demeanor are monitored via the aforementioned telescreens, a hole in the wall, children who are but soldiers and everybody else in between and any suspicion of diversion from The Party dictated truths are sure to find themselves erased off existence. The oppression is complete. In 1984 power is absolute and total and in the hands of a few. It is a world where fear, isolation and morbidity need not veer their tentacles through shadows, but stare blankly through each solid moment of wakefulness, and for that matter even in sleep.  For those familiar with the story it is easy to derive examples of historical references to the story, to the Stalinist era, and as a warning against the dangers of a totalitarian communism but my interest lies in the stark limelight that the evolution of the social structure is thrown into. Like Animal Farm I am more interested in what this novel pertains of the future and perhaps even the present and certainly of the condition that is humanity that seldom bends with time. Most Dystopian fiction rely on the inevitable turn of the Giant wheel that brings whatever was and dresses it in the relevant garb of the century. Arguments have been made whether we are currently even living in Orwell’s 1984. Let’s face it, there is no absolute truth. Historical negation has never been a new term and history is but a few astute observations that had to be written down to be ‘accepted.’ Often, it is from the dictates of power that negation replaces with the next formidable truth. In 1984, Orwell uses the example of a transformative language –Newspeak that replaces the any advent of true expression that inevitable launches a society with a mental handicap. Such power is fluid and is strong, thus capable of replacing some truths with different truths, and the capacity to differentiate has been snatched long ago. To bestow on the propaganda, the media is vital to the many pronged attack. The loss of individualism purported from being told what to think, how to be, who to marry, how to live (any of that sound familiar?) becomes so apparent when Winston advents on the dangerous idea to put in ink the shadow of the thoughts that have been swirling around this head for some time, but when he starts about realizing this scheme, the pen feels unnatural to hold, the scribbles are childish and the act drives him into such a state of shock that the thoughts that he so sought to write of desperately and at such great risk to his life, almost escapes him. Nothing is perhaps as fearsome as the loss of freedom. Many a war has been to preserve that vital necessity. But what of the freedom of thought? What remains, when that power is snatched from us."

2101,Euiseok Jeong,"1984 is George Orwell's dystopia novel that have setting about after world end. Just like name of book, the setting of book is 1984. When George Orwell wrote 1984, the world was dominated by fear of communism. The communism of Soviet spread quickly than american and Europe's thought. Though this 1984, George Orwell warned the idea of totalitarianism, government's power abuse, and dominating civilian's freedom. Yes, this novel has something in common with The brave new world. If brave new world warned the world that people don't need to read the book, George Orwell's 1984 warned the world that people can't read the book because of government. In this 1984, government control people's idea with the power, like soviet, and Nazi. Interesting thing in the novel is, the way of government to control civilian's idea, is already used in history overall time. For example, just like last scene of novel, making people betrays his friend is used during Holocaust. And some of the way(like remove the verb, or word) is still used by al qaeda, which is dictator of Arab. Through this novel, reader will feel sadness, hopeless, and scary. by reading this book, we need to prepare ourselves so no one can dominate ours mind, and stop the dictator."
2102,Deane Barker,"Brilliant book about a dystopian future brought about by the ""perfection"" of politics and The State. The last act is particularly terrifying, both in raw descriptions of torture, and in the systematic breaking down of the human mind.Curious, I couldn't figure out if this would be a favorite of Conservatives or Liberals. I think that either side of American politics could cherry-pick parts of it as supportive of their point of view.The book should be read for the cultural references alone. There are so many words and phrases you will have anew understanding of based on the reading of this book."

2104,Ryan Sean O'Reilly,"Ages like a fine wine with a dark, full-bodied harbinger of doom, increasing with relevance as each year goes by.What can be said about this book that has not already been said? Orwell’s despondent view of an evil utopia hits all the right notes. His vision into a near-possible future is stunning, depressing and all too understandable. A warning, a final prophesy written by a spirited visionary in the final stage of his life.Many have read this book early in their youth, most likely as part of their educational upbringing. 1984 and Animal Farm are standard, pedantic texts battle ready for disaffected youth to sink their teeth into. This book, among the greats, seems boundless in the echoes and touchstones resounding within its tome. In revisiting the text many years later, one will find that Orwell’s words seem strangely even more relevant than they were at first blanch. Perhaps even more so than they were when original meted out and scratched into paper during the author’s self-imposed exile in the Scottish isle that was his final home so many years ago. There are so many elements here that have such deep and broad depth that will keep this work of literature relevant for many more years. Orwell invented the terms “Big Brother” and “Thought Crime” and dove unrepentantly into issues of privacy, personal freedom and individualism. All this before the revolution of the internet! He also fretted over the degradation of language (OMG!) and the breakdown and bastardization of society’s communal bonds, family bonds, bonds of friendship and the abolishment of simple love. His vision of a mechanized society (one that even turns books out by machines), is more than a decry by a luddite so much as it concerns the debasement or obliteration of the individual and sense of self. Orwell’s main thrust seems to be right at the heart of man and the core inner lust for domination and power, simply for its own sake. That ever-present evolutionary tendency to thrive at all costs without purpose or direction, and the ability of that singular impetus to take over and distort all else toward its own end. He digs that up out of the blackest parts of the human heart and disgorges it upon the shoreline of society receding tide as if to say, “This too is what you are. Do not kid yourself.”For me, this book was rough. The tone was bleak. Throughout. Unflinchingly somber and hopeless. Yet, the story of the protagonist and his struggle amid this world turned upside down, is relatable and believable. Despite the obvious despair and immeasurable odds, we do feel for Winston Smith (the protagonist) and we do root for him. We follow him in his desperation to find something, some way to express himself and make a dent in the impenetrable wall that has become the totalitarian society which he is a part. We feel his constant fear and ever present distrust of everything—almost. The little glimmers of possibilities, even when they are squashed, keep your interest and balance the grim-gray that pervades everything. One thing that struck me was that the female character Julia, is an interesting addition. She has a good amount of gumption and serves more than just a goal or love interest. She is fleshed out pretty well and adds a lot of dimension to the story by sharing the protagonist’s goals, but also coming from a slightly different more realistic viewpoint. Another thing I found interesting in reading this book in present time was how insular the story is. We are just as stuck as the protagonist. All news of the outside world and the society is filtered to the reader through the regime in power. We never really know who to trust or when something might be real or made up or mere speculation. Nothing ever really seems certain. The story never ever escapes this – there is never an Oz-like “Man behind the Curtain” moment. Not really. We are told how some things work, and sometimes by sources that are deemed more reliable than others, but we don’t truly find out. This tight view point, keeps up a claustrophobic feeling that forces the storyline to remain connected to the protagonist’s individual struggle. Even though Winston Smith is concerned with larger concepts and a revolutionary struggle on a society level–the story remains individualistic. However, the tale is not a man’s struggle with himself, it is a man’s struggle to find himself among others; the interrelatedness of things and how important that is. The totalitarian regime in power has distorted this effect and is manifesting control by continually putting up road blocks and pseudo-constructed, societal norms to hamper true progress and growth. Even still, the individual struggles to find their place in society. As the story goes on, I think it is clear that most of this doomed society continues to struggle with this. And the powers that be, must expend an immense amount of effort and expense to constantly suppress this. In the end, can that really work? Have a care. Big Brother is watching.Podcast: If you enjoy my review (or this topic) this book and the movie based on it were further discussed/debated in a lively discussion on my podcast: ""No Deodorant In Outer Space"".

2105,Vero Vera,"No sé como comenzar esta reseña, pero intentaré ser coherente. Postergué la lectura de esta novela por años, aún sabiendo que posiblemente se convertiría en mi favorita una vez que lo hiciera y que era probable que pusiera en palabras coherentes muchas cosas que pienso y que creo desde hace muchos años.1984 es un libro que nos cuenta el proceso interno de un hombre llamado Winston Smith que empieza a cuestionarse la verdad sobre un régimen totalitario en el que está inmersa y cree ciegamente la sociedad.La novela, publicada por primera vez en 1950, parece ser un claro reflejo de lo que es el mundo hoy en día, con un montón de medios tecnológicos que apuntan a un dominio y un control de las masas de manera tan sutil que parce ser todo normal.La trama nos inmiscuye en la mente de Winston y en su transmutación desde el pensamiento a los hechos y luego a su resignación, en una oligarquía que no ha dejado nada a al azar y que ha aprendido de todas las dictaduras para mantener el poder, y eso es mutilar todo sentimiento ajeno al odio y a la lealtad a la patria y por supuesto al partido que les domina.Hay tantas frases, tantos conceptos y tanta verdad que rescatar de estas páginas que ninguna reseña que una aficionada como yo pueda hacer le hará justicia a lo que sentí a medida que avanzaba. Pero dentro de mi impresión puedo decir que es una lectura que no dejará a nadie indiferente. Que está llena de matices y retrata de manera tan creíble el dilema de un hombre que comienza a ver los vacíos en la historia de la revolución y que aún así debe actuar para evitar que eso lo lleve a la muerte, que uno se hace parte de su impotencia y de lo irrisoria que muchas veces es la verdad.Demás está decir que recomiendo este libro una y mil veces, pero si por algún motivo alguien no está interesado, al menos que lea el capítulo 9 de la segunda parte porque es tan revelador y pone en palabras simples lo que muchos pensamos acerca del cómo está distribuido el mundo.Sabemos que nadie jamás toma el poder con la intención de abandonarlo. El poder no es un medio sino un fin. No se establece una dictadura con el fin de salvaguardar la revolución; ni se hace la revolución para establecer la dictadura. El objeto de la persecución es la persecución. El objeto de la tortura es la tortura. El objeto del poder es el poder"
2106,Anastasia Cynthia,"Kala itu London tak lagi bernama London, semua orang menyebutnya Airstrip One. Winston Smith, pria berumur 39 tahun, hidup di bawah siluet Partai dan Bung Besar. Winston selalu berusaha mematuhi setiap aturan; menjadi warga negara yang baik. Kendati di lubuk hatinya, ia kerap merasakan antipati terhadap kedudukan Partai yang otoriter, Winston Smith tak berani melakukan perlawanan secara terang-terangan.Tak mengherankan, lantaran Polisi Pikiran, keberadaan teleskrin dan mikrofon yang tersembunyi di setiap sudut kota serta ruangan membuat privasi setiap individu serupa hal utopis. Partai pun bertindak semena-mena terhadap sejarah dan menggubahnya sesuka hati. Negara berkuasa mutlak atas rakyatnya; yang tidak sejalan dan sepikiran maka akan segera diuapkan.

2107,Rigoberto Cardenas," 1984 by George Orwell is a very good book and I recommend to everyone. It's very horrifying thinking about living in that world in which your own children are undercover spies for the government and I think this shows control over people in all aspects in their lives. For example, in page 19, the most private thoughts can eventually be discovered by the thought police, and tried as treason against Big Brother. Everyone lived in a community where dictatorship takes place in. Big Brother is everywhere in posters watching everyone. But he is never actually seen. I think this a symbol that he is the face of the government. Overall, this is a good book because it shows how dictatorship is bad and oppressive to the people."
2108,Samantha Foland,"Easy read, but not a happy storyThis book made me really question my understanding of human nature, truth, and individual importance. The book took no wild turns, I knew just as Winston did that there would be no happy ending. Even so, I think it was important to read."

2111,Abdullah Aldekmary,one of the best book i ever read 
2112,Lamski Kikita,"This book totally distroyed whatever optimism and faith in the human race I had left...seriously.I will skip the part where I say that the book was so well-written, the language perfect, the visual affects present, etc. I just have to say that I am amazed at the accuracy in which Orwell writes about the ""future"" for him, the 80s, for us, the history of our kind since the 30s until now and God knows if we are good enough of creatures to avoid these events in the future. The idea of the negative utopia is not new, but the collection of the atrocities that governments commit and people of different nations accept has never been as accurate as he described in this book. What devestated me the most about this book is that I am just like any ""prole"" in Oceania; i might believe in certain ideas, i might condemn certain acts, but I have stopped trying to do something about it. The Party and Big Brother had absolute controle of life, of history, of people, of past, present, and future, not just because they were brutal and unforgiving, but also because before it came to existance, people had been indifferent, busy with their own little lives, vulnerable to manipulation, and accepting of ultimate state power. Orwell tells us what we know but won't admit: any idealogy can be manipulated to give power to a group and oppress another.If you look for books with happy endings, this is not one of them, and not in the sense that the protagonist dies, no, it is a fate way worse than dying, it's love, and you will only understand it when you read the book.I took my time reading this book, coz it was really hurting me to read it, and feel my hopes for a better world being shattered into peices, but if anything I learnt from the story of Oceania, is that the power of a nation should always be questioned, and that ""political stability"" is overrated, and often indicates a silent population. I definately feel myself leaning even more towards Anarchism after reading this book.Definately one of the best books i have read."
2113,Vaibhav Mathur,"This is my fifth book for the Back to the Classics Challenge, 2015.Frankly, the book was never in my to-read list. I simply read it because I had a two-in-one copy of Orwell's classics: Animal Farm (which I always wanted to read) and 1984. But I liked the first one so much that I simply could not resist starting the second immediately after. And I do not regret it at all. While Animal Farm is undoubtedly relevant to our times, it is still an allegory in which the main characters are animals. 1984 is a much darker book, and here Orwell does not use animals to put his point across. The story is set in a dystopian world in the year 1984, somewhere in England (renamed Airstrip One). The government of the day (the Party) is all powerful, so much so that it controls not only the actions but also the thoughts of citizens. The Party is developing its own language, Newspeak, that would only contain words representing the thoughts of the party, and would be a much reduced form of Oldspeak (the English of old times). Every home has telescreens, which function both as transmitting devices for the party propaganda and as receivers for watching and listening in to the residents. Anyone thinking a wrong thought would be accused of 'Crimethink' by the 'Thought Police' and 'vaporized'. The Party even controls the memories of the people by erasing all links to the past, obliterating books, newspapers, literature, anything that contradicts its worldview. The past is held to be mutable. The embodiment of the Party is Big Brother, a semi-divine figure who watches over everybody, and is never wrong. In this surreal world the protagnist, Winston Smith, finds himself struggling to remain sane and reasonable. He knows that the party is wrong, but he is too scared to admit it even to himself, finally mustering courage to pen his thoughts in a diary, away from the prying telescreen. Later he meets and falls in love with Julia, an Inner party member who, he realizes, also shares some of his thoughts. But they are soon found out by the Thought Police and sent to the 'Ministry of Love' to be tortured so that they confess their crimes, both real and imagined. But the real objective of the torture is to make the victim admit that the party is right, and to make Doublethink (a Newspeak word meaning to know the reality and yet reject it) a part of their psyche. The torture is brutal, and at the end Winston betrays Julia and also says that he loves Big Brother.The story is a grim warning to what extent things can go wrong if totalitarian regimes are left to proliferate unchecked. Similar to the way the animals unquestioningly toiled under orders from the pigs in Animal Farm, the proles (lower classes) are seemingly content with life under the party and never think of revolt. In that sense I believe Orwell partly lays the blame for the suffering of these people on the people themselves - on their inaction, lack of intellect and lethargy. On the other hand, the specter of telescreens is closer to reality now with CCTV cameras everywhere and the daily news of some government agency snooping on our private emails and internet activity. Every political party wants us to belive their propaganda, which they themselves know to be false and yet accept as reality (Doublethink). Even though 1984 came and went, we need to be constantly on guard that our 1984 does not happen in the twenty-first century."
2114,Boshra,من اول الروايات التي قرأتها. قرأتها في لغتها الاصلية. تعد من الاعمال المبدعة لجورج اورويل وتأتي بعد مزرعة الحيوانات وهي رواية رائعة ايضا. اكثر ما شدني لروايات جورج اورويل اسقاطاتها السياسية العبقرية. ومحاولة كشف عيوب انظمة الحكم الشيوعية. انها تظهر ان الحرية هي افضل ما يملكه الانسان. وسلب هذه العطية الالهية هي تدمير للانسان ككيان على المستوى الفردي او كحضارة على مستوى الجماعات.وصف الشخصية الرئيسية في رواية عام 1984:الأخ الكبير – على الرغم من انه لم يظهر في الرواية، وعلى الرغم من أنه قد لا يكون موجودا في الواقع، الا ان الأخ الأكبر، والحاكم لاوشيانسا، هو شخصية مهمة للغاية في الرواية. في كل مكان كان ونستون يرى صورا لوجه الأخ الأكبر خطت تحتها عبارة “الاخ الاكبر يراقبك”. صورة الأخ الأكبر سكت على النقود وظهرت على الشاسات في كل الاوقات. بالتأكيد ذلك حوّل حياة ونستون الى جحيم وملأ قلبه بالكراهية تجاهه.السيد شارلنجتون – هو رجل عجوز يدير متجر في حي برول. شجع ونستون، يبدو السيد شارلنجتون يبادل ونستون في اهتمامه بالماضي. كما كان يبدو أيضا انه يدعم تمرد ونستون ضد الحزب ويشجعه على علاقته مع جوليا، لأنه أجّر لونستون غرفة بدون شاسة لهما. ولكن السيد شارلنجتون لم يكن في الواقع كذلك، لقد كان في الحقيقة عضوا في شرطة الرقابة على الفكر.ونستون سميث – هو شخصية وهمية وبطل رواية 1948 لجورج أورويل. ونستون سميث يعمل كموظف في قسم سجلات وزارة الحقيقة، حيث وظيفته هي إعادة كتابة الوثائق التاريخية بحيث تتناسب مع خط الحزب الحالي المتغيرة باستمرار. وهذا ينطوي على مراجعة المقالات الصحفية وتعديل الصور لإزالة الشخصيات الذين سقطوا من قوائم الحزب او اعتبروا انهم مناهضين له. بسبب قربه من الماكينات التي تقوم بإعادة كتابة التاريخ ونستون سميث تنتابه الشكوك حول الحزب واحتكاره للحقيقة. كلما يظهر نستون أمام الشاسة، والذي يشار إليه برقم “6079 سميث”.ونستون سميث يقع في فخ الانضمام إلى منظمة سرية تهدف إلى تقويض ديكتاتورية “الأخ الأكبر”، هذه المنظمة في الواقع إنشأت بواسطة اوبراين، الذي كان يعمل وكيلا بالحكومة. وكان الهدف منها القبض والتنكيل، في نهاية المطاف يخون شريكته وحبيبته جوليا. أخيرا عندما يعتقل يقبل التأكيد على ان 2 + 2 = 5، وهي العبارة التي دخلت المعجم لتمثل طاعة أيديولوجية معينة واعتبارها أكثر عقلانية من الحقيقة أو الواقع. لا يصور موت ونستون على يد الحزب في ختام الرواية ولكن يوجد اشارة الى ذلك في بداية الرواية. تصوير أورويل لشخصية في احداث تدور حوالي عام 1945 من المؤكد انه يأتي من ونستون تشرشل رئيس وزراء بريطانيا ابان الحرب العالمية الثانية.
2115,Will Cunnington,"​I read 1984 George Orwell, this is a story of a man named Winston Smith who lives in a society where the Government controls everything. They watch what you do, listen to what you say and they want to control every aspect of your life. I really enjoyed this book.In the novel the government forbids their citizens from having independent thoughts, close friends, and even being in love. Throughout the book Winston is extremely frustrated by this. One day a woman named Julia that he works with slips him a not saying that she loves him. They start having a forbidden relationship.He also knows a man named O’Brien, who is a powerful party member but this is never revealed to Winston. Winston suspects that he is a part of the secret organization to overthrow the government, so he believes that he can trust O’Brien. One day O’Brien invites Winston over to his house to go over work-related items. While Winston is at O’Brien’s home, he reveals to Winston that he is a member of the organization that is going to overthrow the government, and he gives him a book that has all of the beliefs of the organization in it. Later on while Winston is reading the book with Julia the thought police burst through the doors and bust them both for their illegal actions. It turns out that O’Brien was working for the government the whole time, and only lied to Winston to catch him. Winston and Julia are separated, and he gets sent to The Ministry of Love, where he is beaten and tortured until he betrays Julia and tells them exactly what they wanted to hear. Afterwards O’Brien reveals to Winston that the Government only does these things just as an exercise of power, there is no other significant purpose.“WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS PEACE, IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH” page 6 “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past” page 35​I enjoyed the book because it is a fascinating look into what a government with total control can do to its citizens."

“War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.”
In a world of constant war between three all-controlling superpowers, every single human being in Oceania is being ruled by the Party. All freedom is gone, all pleasures are forbidden, all information is propaganda, rebellion is unthinkable, and your relatives will not hesitate to betray you. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is a crime, bound to get the attention of the Thought Police and a harsh punishment. And the masses live in constant fear. For they know that Big Brother is watching them...Just like The Lord of the Rings is the mother of all fantasy stories, 1984 is the mother of all dystopian stories. Neither of these books were the first in their respective genres, far from it, but both of them changed their genres into something more, and in many ways became the greatest works ever written.This is as far as I can see an important book more than a good one. George Orwell is a much greater thinker than he is a writer. 1984 is not a spectacular book in any way. It’s not particularly well-written. It’s not particularly complex. But the ideas behind it are greater than any book.Personally, I’ve always considered Orwell to be one of the most important thinkers of the modern era. He’s revolutionised the way we see the world. And while his is the way of the journalist, the political commentator and the social critic, his books are still enjoyable to read for what they are.The thing I find the most interesting about this book is that it’s basically a critique of radical left-wing thought. Yes, you’ll find attacks on capitalism and different forms of authoritarianism. But Orwell’s main attacks are focused towards the dangers of revolution, communism and left-wing thought in general. As the man himself once stated, ""So much of left-wing thought is a kind of playing with fire by people who don't even know that fire is hot.""Now that, however, is not interesting in itself, or special in any way. The interesting thing is that Orwell himself was a left-wing thinker. You might accuse him of hypocrisy, but that would miss the point entirely. The thing that fascinates me the most about Orwell is that he’s a left-wing thinker who manages to see the flaws and dangers of left-wing thought, and subsequently tries to develop his own views from that insight.Since political terms mean different things to different people (although there are right and wrong definitions of most of them), I won’t showcase my own views in a public review. Ask me privately if you’re interested; I love discussing politics. Here and now, suffice it to say that Orwell and I agree on a great many things.So much for the political analysis. For further reading I'd recommend having a look at Isaac Asimov's very critical review, which I found almost as interesting and important as the book itself.“If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—for ever.”More than anything, 1984 is the core of dystopia. It shows us everything that is wrong with our world, everything that has been wrong with it, and most importantly, everything that could go wrong in the future.In addition to presenting the reader with a possible future that to most of us would seem like our worst nightmare, it has a philosophical core bound to enlighten just about anyone on a thing or two. Orwell teaches you the true meaning of power and fear, and of the most stable pillars of human society.This is one of the most important books of our time. It inspired every single dystopian writer after it. It inspired V for Vendetta, one of my favourite movies. It inspired generations of political thinkers. And it’s a book everyone should read at least once.“We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.”"
2118,Hanane,"Dès les premières pages, on perçoit clairement que 1984 fait partie des oeuvres de la dystopie. Le grand Orwell dépeint, d'une manière terrifiante, une société atone où l'homme est asservi sans vergogne, où le moindre mouvement, clin d'oeil, voire de futiles révélations de somniloquie peuvent vous faire ""vaporiser"". A l'encontre des systèmes totalitaires d'autrefois qui visaient à faire obéir les ""hérétiques"" et les rebelles par la terreur et la torture, l'Ingsoc (le parti unique figurant dans le roman), repose sur les mécanismes de la surveillance constante et permanente des citoyens, la manipulation des esprits, le redressement par l'éducation et une falsification inlassable du passé comme celui ""qui commande le passé, commande l'avenir, et qui commande le présent, commande le passé"". Plusieurs décennies plus tard, nous sommes en plein dedans: -Une oligarchie financière qui détient la destinée des masses (les prolétaires) -Une manipulation frénétique des média (diabolisation, falsification des événements, ""futilisation"" ....) -Traçage, localisation, espionnage, lois de renseignement, les états d'urgence et j'en passe ...Bref, je trouve que c'est un livre incontournable, à lire et à relire "
2119,Claire,"I have read reviews on this book that state that it is more an essay than a novel and that it's characters were not relatable and 'bland'. Yes, it is written by Orwell who is a brilliant essay writer, especially on social commentary so elements of that seep into his writing style. However, he is also the most vivid brilliant novelist and this is one of his finest. And if you don't get a beautifully crafted vision of setting and character in your mind through the reading of this book, I feel sorry for you having missed out on this chilling tale."
2120,Cameron J,"1984 takes place in a futuristic dystopian society. Originally written in 1949, Orwell writes about a post WWII world 35 years in the future where Big Brother and Ingsoc rule over what is called Oceania. The government of this time has come to control and watch the movement of all of its citizens, and even though no laws are official, if an unspoken rule is broken punishment can include torture and death. All records of the past have been erased or altered to the point that no one knows for sure what year it is. Hence, the title 1984 really refers to the government’s power to brainwash or confuse an entire country to the point where the year is unknown. Orwell writes “He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.” In changing the records of the past, people have forgotten what is true and have come to accept or believe that Big Brother has always been around and that the world was always like this. By altering records Big Brother seems like all powerful, with the power to predict the future and many successes. In this dystopian society individuality is frowned upon. The Thought Police is present to monitor everyone’s thoughts and if anyone is in suspicion they will be captured than brainwashed/tortured or killed. Everyone is supposed to resign their individuality and become a part of the Party in order to be “free”: “WAR IS PEACE.FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.” This is the Party’s motto it is evident how they wish that all citizens give up individuality and their curiosity in order to become accepted. The book has a deeper political meaning behind it too. Orwell warns and criticizes communist and totalitarian governments throughout the entire novel. It is a warning to not give too much power to the government and to remain free in individual thought and action. "
2121,Eimad,"Wow. Scary world. According to the afterword the opposite of 'Utopia' by Thomas More. Though i know Thomas More but i never read his book so i can't comment on that. But what i can say is that this book is a new age of Nostradomus. With the latest scandal of PRISM and NSA who can say it won't turned out like this. Although not exactly same but not too for away. With constant war and unequal distribution of wealth between proles and top of the chain, more and more of Inner Party or in our world 'top one percent' getting wealthier than ever. I am not a fan of conspiracies but it seems like the government trying to create Orwell 's world exactly the same. The proles must wake up. The capitalists alway said to create enough wealth to overcome social disorder but its BS. The rich keep plundering while the poor keep scrambling the leftovers."
2122,Jake Woost,"Orwell's classic, although written in 1949, is unique in that it becomes increasingly applicable as time goes on. In today's world of smart phones, smart TVs, motion trackers, cameras, etc. the warning received from 1984 becomes more and more unsettling. In an era of progress and fundamental changes, Orwell saw what many could not.1984 describes a dystopian society with an all powerful government know as The Party. Citizens of Oceania are constantly watched and evaluated by various technologies, particularly ""telescreens"". Those who may actively oppose the Party, or even those who are even thought to be opposing the Party (""thoughtcrime""), simply disappear.To those who have enjoyed dystopian novels such as The Hunger Games, Divergent, or The Giver, I would encourage you to read 1984. Not only is it well-written and exciting, but it is also a sobering piece of classic literature seeking to keep the masses awake."
2123,Vikas Agarwal,"The first ""classic"" I have read. And one completely worthy of title. Written in 1940s, the book imagines a world in 1984 where even independent thinking is a crime, the language is being rewritten continuously rewritten so that it has less and less words, thereby narrowing the thought process.A must read!"
2124,Prithvi.bits,"It's damn scary to imagine every action of you being observed remotely by an telescreens, and a government like Oceania! George Orwell's narration is insane. Going to be one of my all time best books"
2125,Larry,"When I belatedly read one of the classics of literature (those I avoided in high school as being stale or irrelevant), I am usually amazed at the universal and timeless truths that are woven into the stories. Having just read Orwell’s 1984, I am truly blown away. You can skip the academic treatises on authoritarianism – why it arises, how it can be sustained. Just read 1984. Orwell nails it.He begins with one of the great opening lines in literature: “It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.” Eerie, very eerie. And soon you are introduced to the dystopia where Winston Smith and the entire populace are taught “war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength”. People are led in a daily Two Minutes Hate, where everyone focuses their hatred on the enemy nation, and particularly the (possibly fictitious) Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People.The possibly of arrest for thoughtcrime and facecrime terrify the populace. Children are taught to turn in their own parent for thoughtcrimes: “It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children.”History was continually rewritten: “Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date,” because, as a party official explained: “Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.” Winston, who is employed to rewrite history, wonders if he was “alone in the possession of a memory” as the public seemed to swallow the all-to-obvious changes.“There was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature, music, drama, and entertainment generally. Here were produced rubbishy newspapers, containing almost nothing except sport, crime and astrology, sensational five-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex and sentimental songs composed entirely by mechanical means.” Hmmm…sounds familiar.The world of 1984 focused on a perpetual warfare among the three major superstates . But Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, explained that the read agenda of warfare was not conquest: “…the three super-states not only cannot conquer one another, but would gain no advantage by doing so…but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and without victory...the [real] war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact.”When Winston is eventually captured and charged with subversion, a party official provides the big picture: “The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness; only power, pure power… We are different from all the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites…The second thing for you to realize is that power is power over human beings. Over the body – but, above all, over the minds. “Reading 1984 did bring out one of my own authoritarian characteristics: if I could, I’d force everyone to read 1984."
2126,Farah Hamdan,The ending of the book gives you the chillss
2127,Manel Olimpico,"Podia falar da minha opinião perante este livro, mas dizer que gostei ou dizer ""ganda livro"" podia enquadrar mas não seria a cena. 1984 fala de uma realidade alternativa mas muito parecida a esta realidade, o facto do autor caracterizar as situações sociais da maneira que é explicito no livro torna a sua visão sobre este mundo, uma visão futurista, por ele conseguir criar uma história com base nos piores medos da sociedade de hoje, medos não conscientes em pessoas que levam as empresas para um futuro de independência, tornando o mundo afastado dos interesses dessa empresa...

2129,Dan Novac,"I loved it. “If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—for ever.”"
2130,Victor Mabuse,"Orwell's prediction of totalitarian government in this book is by no means dated, as the title suggests. Point of fact, one could almost say he was off by 31 years. Is our world as dark as the world he paints, no, at least not yet. As I read the pages, however, I did see the fulfilment of some of his prognostications evident in society.1984 should serve as a warning, but to many in power, I dare say it is used as a blueprint.A must read for any fan of dystopias, this is the proverbial grand-daddy."
2131,عبد الرحمن,"""كان عناقهما معركة ونشوتهما انتصاراً، كانت صفعةً على وجه الحزب بل تحد سياسي.افعلوا ذلك بجوليا، بجوليا ليس بي.تحت شجرة الكستناء الوارفة، بعتك وبعتني.....وجد نفسه يكتب: الحرية هي العبودية، الله هو السلطة، اثنان زائد اثنان يساوي خمسة.لا بأس، فقد انتهى النضال، ها أنا انتصرت على نفسي وصرت أحب الأخ الكبير ""!"
2132,David Asselstine,"1984 is a book that has affected the way we view human government. It lays out a stark reality for any totalitarian government to overcome. One such example is of the overwhelming darkness and cynicism conveyed by Orwell at the end of the novel. While Winston Smith is being interrogated and ""taught"" by Obrien the reader realizes that any hope of a triumphant and rebellious ending is gone. This is particularly shown through two quotes. With the first Orwell is setting up a false allusion of hope when he has Winston narrate, ""If there was hope, it must lie in the proles, because only there, in those swarming disregarded masses, eighty-five percent of the population of Oceania, could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated."" (chap. 7. Book 1). However this slim hope of the overthrowing of the party is quickly destroyed by Obrien, who comments on the same subject, ""Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious."" (Chp.7 book 1) Overall I did not find the cynical approach to the novel effect the experience, rather it enhanced it. Also Orwell's long lectures on politics were fascinating rather than boring. Awesome book. "
2133,Hanan elyousefi,الرواية عبقرية تفتح أفق جديد للتفكير ومداولة الأحداث ؛ وﻻ أستغرب أبداً أن جورج قدمها بهذا الطرح العبقري الفاتن ؛ فبعد حديقة الحيوان اوريل حقق الثورة الفكرية والأدبية بكل ما تعنيه الكلمة من معنى في هذه الرواية .. هي تقرأ وتقرأ وتقرأ .!
2134,Jonathan Ashleigh,“The best books ... are those that tell you what you know already.” 
2135,Haley Williams," 1984 by George Orwell is a book I believe everybody in 2012 should read because of its applicability to today. Orwell creates a character named Winston who lives in a world entirely void of individuality since the government not only tightly regulates life, but has actually managed to control what people think without them even realizing it. It is embedded into them at an early age that The Big Brother or The Party is infallibly good and right on every subject therefore becoming robots with no inner judgment or sense of love. Orwell wrote this book during the time the Communist Soviet Union was in power, but did not write it for the express purpose of criticizing them. He possessed amazing discernment of what the Communists were all about but also saw how these things are becoming true in societies everywhere and wanted to give us a warning of what the world could become like if we don't stand up. He saw that we are in fact already on this track and that we need to do something now in order to keep this nightmare from coming true.  Since he saw these things in 1949, what would he think of the world today? If you read this book, you will see many frightening resemblances to the world we live in. For instance, in 1984 history is constantly being rewritten to make the people think what the Party wants them to since ""he who controls the past, controls the future."" This is happening to us today; truth is being replaced with lies or simply cut out altogether by text book writers who are editing history for their own agenda, and pretty soon this truth will be forgotten altogether! This is such a threat because what you believe about the past is what determines your actions for the future. There is also the Spies: a group of children who squeal on their parents and report them to the Thought Police. This is also seen to be coming true. Children are slowly pulled away from their parents in our society and taught that what they believe is old fashioned and sharing with their teachers the silly view that their parents have. Kids come home from school, and take it upon themselves to educate their parents on the appropriate views and behavior. As one can see, it is not only the tight regulations that the government enforces in your daily life (although that increased control is definitely seen in our government today) but that uncanny ability to transform your mind and the way you think. Today the government is also trying to play ""Big Brother"" by telling you that they know best and it is their job to provide for you. I believe that this book is a warning which encourages us to take action in our daily lives and stand up for what we know is right and also our individual freedoms. Do not give up your individual discernment to be blindly conformed to the masses! "
2136,Henry Senior,"As a person who doesn't read many books, I was at first skeptical of 1984 being good. I was soon proven to be very wrong, as this is probably one of the greatest books I have ever read.The book covers the life of Winston Smith, a middle aged (at least he thinks he is) Londoner, as he as he goes about his everyday tasks in a city of drudgery, anger, and sadness. The city is commanded by the Party, as it rewrites old documents to correspond with current events, amongst other things, and is patrolled by the Thought Police, an organization existing to create a world of controlled thought. And then, of course, there is Big Brother, the Joseph Stalin-resembling character who appears as a deity in front of the general public.I might be slightly bias about this, but I had a wonderful time with 1984! I would definitely recommend this to any fan of dystopian novels, or, for that matter, anyone! This book is doubleplusgood!"
2137,Bennitt,"I recently saw this book as a suggestion by one of those ""50 scariest books you'll ever read"" kind of lists. I had read Animal Farm years before and I know of 1984 (served as inspiration for the Apple Macintosh Ad).The book was not exactly what I expected, despite having some flash backs of V for Vendetta throughout the whole reading experience. I found Winston to be a likeable character and even rooted for him. However, the book did not frighten me.I can draw parallels with what happens in the book and what is happening in my own country as the government attempts to increase control but never did I feel that I might not be able to sleep at night for fear that Big Brother would have me vaporized. Strangely though, the book did have a kind of effect on my own life in the sense that I felt a kind of burning desire to escape what felt like my own version of Big Brother. The Though Police, the very people with whom I work and live, seemed to be out to get me and turn my own ideas against me.Anyway, a good read which I feel deserves five stars and credit for being the inspiration behind things like V for Vendetta and that evil box of wires known as the television. "
2138,Kathleen,"I can actually remember when 1984 was the distant-seeming future. Although it has become dated in some ways, 1984 remains relevant today, serving as a reminder of how easily freedom can be redefined out of existence. It has lost none of its power to horrify and repel the reader; particularly those who follow the contemporary political scene and see words like “patriotism,” “terrorism,” “equality,” “person,” and “freedom,” redefined with alarming disregard for common sense by those who ought to know better. In 1984, the individual has ceased to exist, for all practical purposes, at least until he calls attention to himself through acts of sedition; and in this dystopian world, non-conformism is the very definition of “sedition.”In Brave New World, which I recently reread, the state was as all-powerful and intolerant of unorthodoxy as Oceania, but it maintained, to a certain extent, the illusion of benevolence. The state focused on eradicating any desires that could not safely (that is, without threatening the hegemony of the state) be fulfilled. Through manipulation of the fetal environment, cradle to grave social engineering, and the use of mood-altering drugs, the individual was made to desire exactly what the state needed them to desire. The citizens of Oceania in 1984 are controlled by conditioning of a very different sort. They are controlled through fear and coercion, but here too, drugs play a significant role. This is a much more sinister society, a society devoid of pleasure. I had to laugh when it occurred to me that the former is a sort of left-wing totalitarian state, while the latter is a right-wing one.As of the year 1984, Orwell’s frightening prophecy had ceased to materialize. But now, 30 years beyond that anniversary, we are slouching ever nearer to that dismal world he imagined. I’m not saying we will all one day inhabit the world Winston Smith does, but I do see how the unthinkable can creep up on us in tiny increments—kind of like old age. We’d best be on our guard."
2139,Shameeka Alexis,"Written in 1948, 1984 was George Orwell’s chilling prophecy about the future. And while 1984 has come and gone, Orwell’s narrative is timelier than ever. 1984 presents a startling and haunting vision of the world, so powerful that it is completely convincing from start to finish. No one can deny the power of this novel, its hold on the imaginations of multiple generations of readers, or the resiliency of its admonitions a legacy that seems only to grow with the passage of time.Winston Smith lives in a world without freedom. The four Ministries– the Ministry of Peace, Plenty, Love, and Truth– control everything. Big Brother is watching you! For younger readers, or people who don’t read in general, it may be interesting to know that this is where Big Brother comes from. Being watched any time of any day and judged if you take so much as one step in the wrong direction, is a quite chilling perspective. This father of all dystopias is as terrifying – if not more so – now as it must have been when it was first published. If we look at our world today and how willingly we publish the most private details about ourselves, about our habits and preferences (think Facebook), this book gives you an incentive to question your own behavior.From the very first page, I plummeted into this novel. It has something of a traffic accident quality to it– terrible and scary but you kind of can’t look away. Discovering Winston Smith’s world and how the government is controlling everybody in it, is at the same time a pleasure to read, simply because it is a well-written book, and eye-opening in a very uncomfortable way. Ideas such as doublethink or newspeak scared me more than Pennywise the Clown ever did. But the modification and simplification of language to keep citizens in check is only one of the things that took my reader’s breath away. The seemingly random rewriting of history to suit the government’s current needs was another. If the country is now at war with Oceania, it is made clear that it has actually always been at war with Oceania – even though that’s not true.I could go on and on about all the little details and the big ideas that make this such a monster of a book. But apart from all that, it is an incredibly well written story. The plot shows us how Smith wants to break out of this world and that he’s not the only one. Orwell gives us the slightest bit of hope which keeps us going and rooting for Smith to find something better than a world with though police.I cannot recommend this book enough and I’m quite angry with myself for waiting so long to read it. After a year-and-a-half, the imagery is still as vivid in my mind as it was when I first read the book.Even if you hate the plot, even if you don’t sympathize with Winston Smith, this novel does one thing above all else. It makes you think! I assume that’s why it’s so widely read in schools and I hope it will continue this way. Any friend I have, avid reader or not, I beseech to read this book. It won’t make you happy and it won’t make you feel good, so reviewing it in summer is maybe not such a great idea, when everybody wants light, fun reads. But I don’t care. Whether you’re 13 or 83, if you have a shred of curiosity in you, if you think the world is not perfect and if you want to share this vision of a man from the 1940ies: Read. This. Book"
2140,Ulia,"""if you want to keep a secret,you must also hide it from yourself."""
2141,Deniz Cem Önduygu,"It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. It isn't only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite in itself. Take ""good"", for instance. If you have a word like ""good"", what need is there for a word like ""bad""? ""Ungood"" will do just as well – better, because it's an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger version of ""good"", what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like ""excellent"" and ""splendid"" and all the rest of them? ""Plusgood"" covers the meaning, or ""doubleplusgood"" if you want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already. but in the final version of Newspeak there'll be nothing else. In the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words – in reality, only one word. Don't you see the beauty of that, Winston?I know we're supposed to be terrified by this but I actually see the beauty of that. It is true that you cannot (and shouldn't, politically speaking) impose a designed language on the public but the idea of a modernistic, minimalistic reduction towards a less redundant and more modular language is appealing to me at least as a theoretical exercise. Apparently Orwell was also ambivalent about it: in a series of broadcasts to India that he produced from 1942 to 1944, he chose to use Basic English, an English-based controlled language (a simplified subset of English) created by Charles Kay Ogden in 1930, which would later be his inspiration for Newspeak in 1984. [There are in fact many constructed languages, Volapük being the cutest in my opinion.] I can feel that when he wrote the above passage for the lexicographer Syme, some part of him was still strongly empathizing with the character and seeing ""the beauty of that"".I would argue that Orwell's ambivalence manifests itself throughout the book: even though he depicts with Oceania an extreme and horrible form of modernity, he actually takes the side of rational modernist thinking versus what could be called postmodernism – interestingly, represented also by the Party – on important crossroads, through the protagonist Winston's thoughts:In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. (...) Not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. (...) His heart sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any Party intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand, much less answer. And yet he was in the right! They were wrong and he was right. The obvious, the silly, and the true had got to be defended. Truisms are true, hold on to that! The solid world exists, its laws do not change. Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported fall towards the Earth's centre. With the feeling that he was speaking to O'Brien, and also that he was setting forth an important axiom, he wrote:Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.
If you're not convinced that this passage relates to the modernism-postmodernism duality, here are O'Brien's (a member of the Inner Party) words to Winston:You believe that reality is something objective, external, existing in its own right. You also believe that the nature of reality is self-evident. When you delude yourself into thinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external. Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party holds to be the truth, is truth. It is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the Party. (...) You must get rid of those nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of Nature. We make the laws of Nature. (...) Before man there was nothing. After man, if he could come to an end, there would be nothing. Outside man there is nothing.You are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us. But we create human nature. Men are infinitely malleable.The resemblance of these sentences to postmodernist-poststructuralist thinking is striking, especially because these schools of thought weren't around when the book was written; O'Brien dubs it ""collective solipsism"" in his dialogue with Winston. (The word postmodern was in use at that time, albeit only within the context of art/architecture in a much narrower sense.) Of course these ideas have their ancestors in the history of philosophy, but it is Orwell's genius that he presented a staggering discussion of them with a novel written in 1948 in such a way that it nearly encapsulates the intellectual climate of the second half of the century. What is more intriguing to me is that he has managed to describe in a convincing way an oppressive regime that is both modernist and postmodernist to the core at the same time.When we navigate the ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we often find it convenient to assume that the Earth goes round the Sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of kilometres away. But what of it? Do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy? The stars can be near or distant, according as we need them. Do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that? Have you forgotten doublethink?The concept of doublethink itself (the act of simultaneously accepting two mutually contradictory beliefs as correct), by the way, is one of the key features of postmodernist literature, both as a characteristic of it and as a cherished quality in other things.So, on one hand Orwell criticizes modernism through a caricature (a full-scale minimalization and modularization of language, strict standardization of the living spaces and of people, total disconnection from the past, etc.) while on the other he defends, through Winston, modernist thinking against the postmodernist ideas of the Party. Was he exercising doublethink himself when he wrote the book? Maybe he was just lucky enough to live in a period when thinking outside the modern-postmodern paradigm was still the natural thing to do. Or maybe he was deliberately rejecting modernism and postmodernism, hoping for a third alternative – or indeed having no hope for humanity whatsoever.In any case, I do believe that Orwell was expressing his own thoughts when he wrote these lines for Winston:Being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad."
2142,Chanhong Jeon,"This book is interesting. The background about this book is demonstrating cold war era. There were lots of conflict between socialism and capitalism. However, do you believe this book is written in the 1930's? The author of this book accurately demonstrated about the situation of the socialist country during the cold war period. The country is formed by the leader called 'Big Brother', and the main character Winston Smith is a person who was counterrevolutionary. This book shows how the government keeps tracking your every single behavior, and how to brainwash the civilians. George Orwell, the author this book, is from Great Britain, and he wrote this book in 1930's. According to his background, this book is a kind of propaganda which shows why the socialism is bad. We can see the conflict of the socialism and the capitalism through this book and the author's background."
2143,Yasiru (reviews will soon be removed and linked to blog),"Every once in a while I try to write a review for this, then invariably discard it as inadequate. One thing that's unquestionably true about Orwell's novel (and indeed his work at large- including his excellent essays) however, is that there's an immediacy, a palpable closeness (or 'closing-in-ness' perhaps) to his direct and lucid narrative which readily reflects those matters most demanding of our attention today. From the state of governance globally to the fissures and cracks at smaller levels, directly down to the individual- the follies of apathy, revisionism, nationalist distraction and other entirely human fallacies we excuse daily, all find strong resonance in the narrative, though one is likely on first reading to be swept along by the sheer emotional pull towards the ruthless end.At least as preamble, I invite the reader in doubt of this relevance to watch this-http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGo1Dq...(In case the video is taken down under copyright, the link is to a BBC documentary series called 'The Power of Nightmares'; 'The Trap' is from the same filmmaker is another good documentary series.)Having noticed there's an edition here with an introduction by Thomas Pynchon, a search yielded it at- http://www.scribd.com/doc/100899/Pync...Eric Fromm's afterword for the popular Signet Classics edition is at-http://douglassocialcredit.com/resour...I'm not aware of any good annotated editions, but a good separate guide may help better than an accompanying essay or a read of Wikipedia or even a good documentary to understand the historical perspective from which Orwell wrote this dystopian classic.Since the book is out of copyright in Australia and a few other places, it may be downloaded as a very nicely formatted .pdf file here or elsewhere."
2144,Benjamin Atkinson,"With novels such as 1984, I have already heard or read so many allusions to the narrative structure that I have an unfortunately limited pre-conception of the true depth and gravitas of this masterpiece. Often compared with Huxley's Brave New World, I find Orwell's vision colder and more deeply textured. All great literature touches on timeless themes about humanity. In 1984, we explore themes of identity, personality, freedom, the soul, personal expression all through the lens of the individual versus the state. In this case, a very totalitarian state that maintains rigorous monitoring of its citizenry, along with constantly bombarding them with hawkish propaganda. Its hard to give spoilers with 1984, because so much of it has become a part of our common culture. If you have ever heard ""Big Brother is watching"" that is from 1984. This book can be viewed very pessimistically. However, I found it to have some of the most romantic prose I have ever read. Just as much as this novel is about the state's collective ability to crush one man's soul, it just as much manifests a platform from which that same person can never truly be denied their humanity, because it is intangible. Hope can always overcome oppression because you can never turn on the dark but you can always turn on the light. Brilliant."
2145,Jason Pettus,"One of those classics I haven't read in a long time, that I remember being very good, but that I should really read again soon in order to confirm. Even more important than before these days, in fact, in that it was one of the first projects ever to precisely define exactly what Fascism is; remember, before this novel, there were lots of disagreements over what linked Hitler and Mussolini together (for example) ideologically, apart from it being advantageous for them to team up against the Allies. When I think back now to so many of this book's plot points, they match up with actual items from the Bush administration so precisely to be scary; that's why I'm thinking of sitting down soon and reading this again for the first time in a decade."
2146,Rosie,"Years ago I had read Animal Farm and I loved it, 1984 has been on my ‘to read’ list ever since and I have finally found the time to read it. I fell in love with it before I had even finished the first chapter.1984 centers around Winston Smith, living in a world controlled by The Party and Big Brother. There is no secrecy and no trust, just loyalty to The Party and unquestioning their ways - if you question their ways or seen as a threat you are ‘vaporized’. However Winston isn’t like everyone else, he secretly hates Big Brother and longs to find someone like him. The novel follows from his rebellion in the form of a diary; rebellion in the form of love to the horrific inner workings of the Ministry of Love. This society terrified me from the beginning; the thought that these people were being forced to live like this shocked me. Although despite how disturbing I found it I couldn’t put the book down - I just had to find out more about it and more about Winston. What made this novel so frightening was the fact that this could happen. There are always people out there who want to rule; and we’ve seen in the past how people can be brainwashed and follow power blindly. However the characters don’t seem to remember the past, a life before The Party and the war with Eurasia, everything has been erased and rewritten in NEWSPEAK (Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer - all gone!)The novel is split into three parts, the first is there to introduce the reader to this new society. The second is about a hidden love affair and the third, the consequences. At first it doesn’t seem like there’s anything going on in the way of action - some may find this a little boring but I was so fascinated to hear about The Party and their rules that I didn’t care. The plot beings to thicken in the second part and is in full swing by the third. Even if you feel like giving up I strongly advise that you stick with it as everything starts to make sense and the ending is sensational - it was how I imagined it from the start although it still left me speechless and seldom.What made this novel even more enjoyable was the characters. It was very easy for me to identify with Winston as I felt the same disdain to this new way of living that he has. This reinforced my opinion that Orwell is such a talented writer as this book just made me feel so much; I could feel myself being manipulated by his words - ironically much like many characters were manipulated by words by The Party. As a reader I wanted him to challenge what was happening and to escape unscathed. He is the only character we’re able to trust (however at times it appears there are other people on our side). Then there is Julia who loves him and they’re both cautiously ecstatic about finding someone like them - for a while it looks like there is hope for our protagonist.I genuinely didn’t see a lot of the twists coming and I wasn’t ready, or able to predict, the horrors of the Ministry of Love. This just made the book even more exciting for me. There were times when my jaw literally dropped because of various revelations. Everything ties in so well and by the end all the puzzle pieces fit together and you realise what has been going on; you even see what The Party is really like with their methods.1984 is the first novel, for a long time, that I have really loved. I have read many dystopian novels and none of them has affected me in the way that this has. It has easily made its way onto my list of favourite books and I know that re-reading this will be just as amazing as it was the first time round. I’ve only just put it down and I already want to be sucked back into it.This is a novel that I will never forget and I think everyone should be exposed to it."
2147,Diana Escamilla,"""Quien controla el pasado controla el futuro; quien controla el presente controla el pasado""Escrito en los años 40, 1984 describe un futuro ficticio* turbio y desolado, donde la libertad y privacidad han desaparecido. Simplemente es un libro complejo y asombroso. Imprescindible......Y realmente resultan inquietantes los ligeros* paralelismos de la sociedad plasmada en el libro y la actual. La vigencia de esta obra es incontrovertible."
2148,The book Recluse,"I first read 1984 when I was in middle school. I was on a quest to read all of Orwell's works after finishing Animal Farm a few years earlier. Yet, it had been so long since I have last read the novel that I had forgotten quite a bit.The scary thing about Orwell is that he picks up on the small details, such as the importance of language in forming ideas, and he explains them in such a way that even a die hard believer in a happy ending is left thinking....well maybe that could work. That is a scary prospect.The world that is created is similar to socialist or communist societies, yet it is manipulated with the artistic flair of science fiction and ingenuity. The characters are real, meaning they are likable and appalling. You feel sympathy for them, cheer for them, and are disappointed in them. No matter the emotion, you connect with them.Orwell is a masterful and popular storyteller. His novel, 1984, is worth the hype that it has received. It is expertly written, and to date the best dystopian novel ever written."
2149,Brynn,"It's hard to know exactly where to begin. This is probably the heaviest novel I've ever read, and a huge amount of topics are discussed, either in depth, at a surface level, or somewhere in between; after finishing it just a few minutes ago, I want to say that the ""main"" theme is objective reality v.s subjective reality, but you could just as easily say that privacy (or lack of) is the main theme, as well as a dozen other different things. A whole gleaming spectrum of ideas and ideologies are discussed here - it may be dystopian fiction on one level but it's also, obviously, a political essay, a terrifying and remarkably clear one that, ironically, vividly outlines the difficulties and potential terrors of ambiguity. It is a very effective novel, prophetic in some unnerving ways, and scary. It actually scared me. I've read a fair amount of books and I've never been scared like that before.Why was I so scared? I think that's the key here. I was scared, I think, because what happens to Winston Smith seemed like a thing that might happen to me. Winston is introduced as a logical, intellectual man, able to separate himself to a degree from the insane society he lives in - his responses are mostly very understandable, his hatred of Big Brother natural, his fear utterly relatable. You must be on his side because the other side is insanity. Winston is reasonable; he might not be perfect (or even all that likable, really, when you get right down to it) but you can't not be on his side, because, like I said, he seems to be the only sane one. It's like being in a strange nightmare, in a town you've never been in before, and all the people there are unknown, unfriendly, and potentially dangerous - and you initially think you're all alone - but Winston is there to see the reason in things. By default the reader and he become comrades. Together maybe we can get through this insanely disturbing novel. Of course, (very huge spoiler up next) Big Brother does get Winston in the end. I guess I knew that was coming. And now I go back to why I was so scared - because the process which makes him buckle under, although seeming sometimes absolutely insane and impossible, was written in such a way that I found it, at other times, completely plausible. And because Winston and the reader are comrades, probably similarly minded, you start to think it could happen to you. That for all your intelligence and reason, in the end - it could happen to you. Big Brother might get you, too. Maybe I'm sounding a bit paranoid, but that's the feeling that the novel evoked - an utter annihilation of privacy, the unmaking of a perfectly reasonable, intelligent individual, going against all the ""good"" or ""correct"" forces of the universe that most people feel will prevail. In the end, these maybe-pretend forces do not prevail, as you could I guess suggest Winston is, at least for a while, their instrument (if you believe in them). The insanity of unreasonableness, the might of a backward and awful society that seems terrifyingly plausible, prevails instead. Other books have done similar things. But I wasn't so scared of them. It's probably a combination of the powerful language, the realism, and the pure intelligence of the novel that made me feel that way. While I don't really understand the appeal of many classic books, I do for this one. It satisfied me at an intellectual level. Not to sound pretentious, hopefully. George Orwell's understanding of politics and society is, like I said, astoundingly clear; I couldn't have put it in nearly such a straightforward way. I could see why people might find it dry and boring at times, and it could easily be if you aren't interested in the social commentary and all of that - but me, taking delight in all things politics and philosophy, had a grand time. I love being challenged intellectually, and this was at the right level for me - hard enough that I had to use my brain more than just at an idle running speed, but not so hard that it became gibberish. It made me think, and also validated some of my own thoughts and musings, which of course leads me to think I'm smarter than I probably am. Also, by the end (like I mentioned) you're given one of those arguments that never has any real answer: objective reality v.s subjective reality.The Party and Big Brother believe in a subjective reality, that is, that the things that happen in the world, in the past specifically, are true only once the human brain has comprehended them, and that if events pass without conscious observation by people, then they haven't happened at all. That you can rewrite the past not just in a superficial way but in a literal way. Winston, meanwhile, originally believes that existence rolls along independent of the human brain, and once things happen, they happen and will remain that way in the untouchable past as fact forever. Most people would probably lean towards Winston's view of reality - it seems logical to assume that the universe isn't just contained in our own heads - but the problem is that the idea of a subjective reality also seems plausible, looked at from certain angles. How do we know for sure? That question is why answering definitively is impossible. What the Party ultimately does is rob Winston of his ability to think of reality as something objective. It doesn't sound so bad when you say it like that, but what goes along with is is a complete reversal of his emotions and personal philosophy - once determined to see Big Brother overthrown and the world return to a more sane state where people can think for themselves and do what they please, by the end Winston is a hollowed-out puppet. Whether something like that could realistically happen, I don't know. There is maybe an element of exaggeration in that respect, but at the same time there's still that unsettling grain of plausibility. Why couldn't that happen? The reality of 1984 probably will never happen. In my personal opinion, I would find that pretty remarkable if society ever evolved in such an extreme way - but elements of that extreme society aren't just plausible, they're really happening. We shouldn't get too hysterical and go around taping our laptop cameras and buying dark sunglasses, but we should be aware that a single-minded government (or governments) are certainly capable of impeding upon our personal privacy, and in fact already have to a degree. 1984 is a prophetic warning against what society might become, and has started to become, even while its extreme state probably won't be reached in reality.In the end, I was thoroughly impressed with this one. George Orwell is more than a capable writer, not only in terms of the conveyance of ideas but also just in simple terms of prose. It's an excellent book and I'm sure I'll read it again to see what more I can get out of it."

2151,Darryl Knickrehm,"Wow. What a book. Written over 60 years ago and still very relevant today. After reading (and being disappointed by) A Brave New World, I had my reservations about reading 1984, for out of all genres, Sci-fi ages the least graceful. But I found 1984 to not be a book written in 1948, but something that could have been written at any time (even today). The prose was surprisingly clear, non-complex and succinct. It evoked the senses and had action and pace, something very modern. The structure too was arranged to build in tension and complexity (something I find lacking in 'dated' fiction). And above all, the message being told is as relevant today as it was back when the book was first published. That is what I believe makes this book so great, and so truly frightening. 1984, however, can at times be uneven, devoting extensively large chapters to 'explaining' dogma and politics. That said, the things said in those chapters are just as interesting as the plot and in actuality, all that 'info dumping' is truly where the core of the book is. In these political sections, there is a truth to what is being said. Things that might sound familiar. Things that may have happened in some form in your own country. That is when this book becomes riveting. That is when this book becomes truly scary.And that effectiveness, that thing that makes 1984 so influential, is its powerfully accurate message about society and government, a fact that has and always will be a true -- the power of a dangerous (or any) government is its control over its peoples thinking without them realizing they are being controlled. The totalitarian dictatorships of the past are obvious examples (look at the Nazis and making genocide 'acceptable'), but what is more frightening is, some of the statements describing the ridiculously oppressive Big Brother government, describe even some actions done by our 'free' democratic governments. It is truly disturbing to realize actions in your country's past may have had the same purpose this fictional government had -- trying to control your thinking.That brings us to the purpose of all of this. 1984 isn't meant to be just doom and gloom, it is meant to be a wake up call. Like 1984 says: 'Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.' Knowledge is power. And the only way to prevent such terrible acts of control from developing is for the people to have real knowledge of what is happening. As such, I think this book should be read in schools. When a statement, even fictional, can be still relevant decades, even generations later, it is proof that it is in some way true. 1984 portrays accurate signs of an unjust governing system. Things everyone should be aware of. Things everyone should fight against so that 1984 never truly becomes reality."
2152,Edgar Trevizo,"A mayor comprensión mayor dolor. Esta vez fue más desgarradora la lectura hacia el final. su ""falso recuerdo"" me arrancó las lágrimas. su desolación me caló hondo. Aun así, no quería terminar de leerlo. Hasta la siguiente, Orwell."
2153,Sasha  Mizaree (Reviews),"This is one of my favorite novels of all time. However, I do not recommend reading this at a time when you are clinically depressed, which is what I did. While I was still able to enjoy it, the grim subject and content did not fend well with my state of mind at the time. When my college announced that they put on a play by this novel, I took my whole family to see it. This was one of their promotional photos.And the show was amazing. This, as you may have guessed is a novel with a political and social message. You have Winston Smith's hate for sexual oppression. You have Julia who challenges all that. You have a government that watches your every move. You have doublethink.  If you are into totalitarian, dystopian novels with a heavy message, that doesn't exactly end in happily ever after, then it is for you.I do recommend listening to Muse's album ""The Resistance"", which was written entirely about 1984, as a soundtrack to the novel. That made my experience with this very multi dimensional. They did make a crappy movie by this novel in the 80's, but I hope for a remake. And I'd kill to play Julia. :D"
2154,W. G. Saraband,"""1984"", Orwell's greatest masterpiece, has only a single fault: its premise failed by thirty years. For if it was called ""2014"", only minor details would need changing.This is an intelligently written book; one you wish to have written yourself. The author has a peerless capacity of examining the problems in the world he built, translating them with utter perfection into our own frail reality. It is as disturbing as it is addictive, and it casts a shadow so deep upon your reason that it will be impossible not to carry ""1984"" as a weightless burden in your conscience for the rest of your life.One of humanity's greatest books."

2157,Lionel,"It is kind of strange. There is no story here. No real plot. Just the description of a totalitarian society and an exemple (winston). But it makes you think about things like politics, media, marketing and the fact that as much as you would like to rebel against it, you can do nothing alone. And that it is almost impossible to wake the consciousness of everybody about it. I don't think we are doomed nonetheless but a perfect society will only be possible when each and everyone sees the pettiness of today's society. You simply can't create an utopia when sexism, racism or other intolerence are still existent. But hey, it's only my opinion"
2158,Mohammad,"George Orwell's ""1984"" was definitely a book that had a profound impact on me for various reasons. Orwell beautifully creates a world where the mere thought of rebellion is forbidden through powerful but simple psychological methods like Big Brother. It then leaves those in power to do whatever it is they want, effectively conveying a world of pure submission. Multiple times when I was reading I wondered if submission was really preferable to extinction. Morally, some people would rather die than submit to some higher power. However, through the conception of ""1984"", it dramatically brings a world founded on submission. The people fear individuality, they fear that the government controls every emotion, thought and action. The protagonist Winston believes that they are not omnipotent and desperately tries to find something they cannot control. This leads him on a downward spiral to the dangers of freedom and self-thinking. I loved this book despite how depressed it made me but it seems the best books are those that touch us at a personal level that we are not even comfortable with. Also, this book is heavily detailed and has great and memorable writing. It effectively transfers the tone of the book easily to the reader. Readers will grow to sympathize with Winston's struggles and will want to shout ""down with Big Brother"" with as much malice and pride as possible. This book is definitely a must, especially if you read Orwell's other books, like ""Animal Farm"". It is very fascinating and quickly becomes a book you cannot put down until you read it to the very end."

2162,Joel,"What it is that we want? A warning, an option? The party can't be forever. A proletarian somewhere must also pass on the idea. An underground base must be equally as subtle. There are too many people in the world who get strange ideas for no apparent reason to say the proletarians could never rebel. They're unwatched. Now what if everyone got tested, even proletarians, at 16. There are still some to slip through the cracks, to see what's going on. Control and power over the party may be stronger than anything yet enforced, but omnipotence and omniscience over all its subjects is impossible to affirm by the very nature of not knowing if you don't know that you don't know. What O'Brien said may not have been concretely true at all, since reality is in the mind, then a whole horde of proletarians could be coming to burn them down and since he believes the party to have absolute power than even when confronted with demise he will go on seeing it as reality. Doublethink is not useful in times when a response to danger or change must be immediately addressed. There's always gonna be ""sick phucks"" by a society's standard that could shift what is popularly thought of as desirable. People naturally rebel, even against what is good. Think. Moral men manned the concentration camps of the Nazi's, corrupted by overwhelming evil. But not all of them could've been unresisting, merely attaching themselves to the most magnetic of powers available. Some are not like that. The human mind is too distinct from the human mind. Yes we are all remarkably similar when summed, but how different in some ways, by what others tell us though... And if big brother is the only one doing the talking then oh my. But even then, some MUST rebel, don't assume your mind's shortcomings are inherent in everyone, some are not merely defiant, some are formed from a different clay altogether, but then that is false because our genes are the clay and it's all there, the same 99.99% for everyone.	It is a fully imagined world, from details big and small, of the three major powers, their purposes, down to the posters of big brother, the grimy walls, the proletarians who resemble, oddly enough, the normal people of today. Its premise, that the successors of last year's government should eventually figure it out, is pheasible, and frightening. In fact this enitre book is frightening in the power it had to open my eyes about why I act against my will, and what my will is ultimately guiding me towards. My belief in God for the past three years, if there was any, was itself and act of doublethink, and continues to be. I realize that I have been trying to convince myself that yes, although in reality I do not accept his existence, it'd be nice for him to be, more comfortable, would give me an imaginary friend whose promises I can fall back on. I had deliberately been betraying my logic in a loop of escapist thoughts and traps. Is it better to be happy, or to be knowledgeable? The ideas in this book were very well thought out and explored, yes reality, as far as we can tell, is only what we think it is. It's out there always without us, but how to reach and and grasp it? What are the powers above us trying to accomplish? What would be best, and how to decide that when everyone's definition differs? Is it tempting to say that being told what is best and never hearing otherwise could bring and end to... what? To refute this remember: would you prefer to be lied to if the truth would cause you suffering? So many thoughts, and warnings, and predictions and battling philosophies and their consequences come together in this novel and I'm glad he wrote it. It's minor flaws or weaknesses in argument can hardly be called flaws at all because their rebuttles have never been proven or called for in the real world. But it's a good guess, as good as any, and has such a practical application to our lives that it might be hard to go back to lighter, escapist stories, at least with the same enjoyment."

2167,Axel Ainglish,"1984 ranges as the most sold book of past century behind the Bible. It is a forced reading in many anglo saxons high bachelor institutes and schools. Is a hard, raw novel concerning politics, love, betrayal and torture (and this both senses, psicological and phisical ways).They are all living in a world where history, being changed when and as Government wants, citizens have come to a point in which they do not know anymore in what year are they living in. It is supposed to be 1984 when it starts. This haunting nightmare of a possible human future reminds all time to certain last century awful ways of governing. Needless to mention which two ones. They are governed through and by the Intelligence Service (does Putin Government tells You something about this?), in the book the so called Thought Ministry. So, they think they have a leader, who is a war heroe and whatever else You or they may want. But in reality no one knows that one. Is only a virtual icon, a face in a big screen. That is said to watch the population everywhere, full time. There is the Propaganda Ministry, the History Ministry and could not lack, the War Ministry. For they all live in a permanent economy war State. Having the whole world been divided in only three continents. The citizens we know, e.g., live in Eurasia. In this context, there is only one political party to which all are forced to be part of. Altough, to become a militant, one has to deserve it. For sure. Does all this remind You some despotic regimes? -Then You can reach higher positions in the Party, for instance, betraying a friend or the love of your live and denouncing him or her as a Party enemy.In this context, two militants, officials of the Party caught the eye one each other and start an affair leading them directly into sincere and wonderful love. And shall leave the plot at this point for it deserves not to be revealed. Only adding that this absolute Masterwork will constant and increasingly surprise the reader with turnings of the screw. Me, while reading it, thought twice or three times: okay, and now what? and then ""and what else now?"" and again: ""but what else can happen, it is going to end now?""- but no, there is always a beyond. Or so it seems. Not to say, that when it really ends, the open and perfectly closed end is the least but logical, one could expect. So, how not recommend to everybody (if someone has not read it yet) this beautiful terror metaphoric storytale? The big O stands in its highest literature position due to this work. Maybe he is still watching us all, all along his watchtower. He shall live for ever in our minds, that is sure. "

2172,Muthu Raj,"Updated on 10th of January, 2016. Minor spoilers, but nothing that will compromise the enjoyment of reading the novel in the author's words.This is perhaps the first novel I have read entirely at the  Anna Centenary Library. ACL is one of Asia's largest libraries, and famously received a 2,794 page long invoice from Cambridge university press, for books worth 1.3 million GBP. And it's in walking distance from my hostel.1984 is not a novel about 1984. It is a novel about every year that follows it, and every passing year has one mission: Vindicate George Orwell and his predictions. And you'll be pleased to know humanity is tirelessly doing just that.Let's come to the book. I have tried to get through this novel at the formative years of my reading. I have always stopped it in the first 30 or so pages. I am actually kind of happy that I did so. Why? Because, until you achieve a certain maturity, the books you read are like those childhood stories your parents tell you. You have a vague but sure memory of enjoying the time immensely, but you don't always know what it was about. And a novel as this, is too good to be used as expendable in such manner.Now, I can read with much more patience, can understand much more that when I started out, and more importantly, I know much more about state sponsored mass surveillance, which is the crux of this novel.I am a computer engineering UG student. And there is no doubt that today, computers aid the most massive surveillance, in all of humanity's really long history. And we seldom know about it, much less care, for the surveillance agencies are very good at being invisible. It is only partly funny that the NSA was expanded to 'No Such Agency' in the initial years.In my field, we often hear news of such surveillance measures, at a much higher frequency than in the general mainstream media. The technologies involved interest us. And in such news, there is almost always at least one person commenting with the adjective Orwellian. I was familiar with the word, but never bothered enough to force myself through the book. Until I read Sabah's review, that is.George Orwell writes about a world, where the state is in a perpetual state of war, with the remaining two states in the world. Oh, and the state has superior surveillance, geared towards making sure people believe in and wholesomely contribute to the war. There are other motives, but I don't want to spoil the plot for you, in case you haven't read it yet. This following quote shall suffice, until I reread and comment on the writing of George Orwell, rather than summarizing the story poorly, insulting my own intelligence and the author's. Let's look at surveillance first. Big brother is watching you, can be, and ought to have been a reassuring phrase. Don't worry baby, your big brother is watching you [over] is enough to calm anybody's nerves about anything worrying at all. Except, in this case, it is not. State surveillance agencies have a habit of using something akin to this familial tie (Brother) to legitimize their peeping at us, constantly. Usually, it is patriotism. Patriotism is such a primal feeling that even beings of logic and extra ordinary reasoning fail to see reason when they imbibe patriotic words. It is something that has the power to bring people together, something that can validate humans killing each other, spying on each other, and much worse things, because, in the beautiful words of Macaulay,
[...]And how can man die betterThan facing fearful odds,For the ashes of his fathers,And the temples of his Gods.
Orwell succeeds in painting an extraordinarily vivid picture of a society that has been convinced that they need to be at war. The constant flooding of information about victories in battle, the war being closer to the end than it ever was. The daily two minute hate was replicated in the real world by almost every country that was at war with another. People were told about terrible weapons of mass extinction, bio-weapons and what not. Iraq war springs to mind. [Green Zone is a movie you might want to watch, if you enjoyed 1984]Politicians invoking patriotic feelings to aid war is not actually a terribly new thing. We have been doing that for a very long time. It is always some hidden army that will strike us someday, and can be prevented only if we preemptively strike them. The Americans, have great experience in this, convincing their own citizenry that they are the big brother of the world, somehow tasked with bringing peace in the world, and always make sure they engage in war with people for far flimsier reasons than they have a right to.Once you convince them you need to be at war with the rest of the world, the next thing to do is warring with your own citizens. Here, almost every single country in the world is at fault. Mass surveillance enables this. The telescreens are modern day CCTV cameras. You are being watched constantly, and your every move given an adversarial meaning.People often wonder why you need to be worried about being watched if you have nothing to hide. Such people, can watch this  Video  of the immensely talented John Oliver interviewing Snowden. It will be frightening how Snowden has been painted a traitor, and reminds us of a much more subtler version of the Thought Police.Winston writing in a diary and fearing he might be executed for that is not entirely devoid of real world counterparts. State or terrorist execution of bloggers is a news we are all too familiar with.Such things are made possible only because of mass surveillance. And we have a myriad of three letter and four letter agencies doing their job 24x7. Snowden revelations, the PRISM program, Wikileaks, are very small apertures through which we can look into the scary world of Big Brother. We have computers that have become extensions of our bodies and minds. And in essence, knowing your computer is knowing you. How? A computer records everything it does. Usually it is for our own convenience. Just like to keep some things close to us, than the others. It helps to remember what websites you researched yesterday, without taking up the memory space needed for it. It helps to remember the song you recently heard, since you may decide you like and want to play it again tomorrow. But, it also helps people who want to watch you because, in essence, your computer is like a detailed journal of your thoughts, tastes and leanings. And that is why governments want to put back doors in our computers. Some succeed without spooking people. Some, like Kazakhstan, just pass a law and make it impossible not to be watched. [Source.] There is a very real possibility that you have not heard about this. Convinced yet? So yes, we have mass surveillance and mass hypnosis happening right amongst us.So, the question here is not whether George predicted all the minute details for us. It is that he predicted the broad plans, and gave us convincing reasons to believe in that predictions. How could you have a slogan like “freedom is slavery” when the concept of freedom has been abolished?Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.And when memory failed and written records were falsified – when that happened, the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it could be tested.Orwell manages to tell us all this, and not once do you find it implausible. He isn't too keen on propaganda or advancing his own ideas. The things that happen is his novel, happen here too, albeit for different reasons than stated in the novel. But they do happen and with an alarming similarity to the fiction.And we have it happening, with an exponentially subtle manner. It is almost to believe in it, even if the truth is staring right in our face.People often tell you the novel is depressing. It is not. If anything, it is like reading a prophecy that is coming to fulfillment around you. But it need not scare us. You know why? For every Winston that submits to the Big brother, we have a Snowden that breaks the Big brother's nose. All we need to do is not to let ourselves believe that anything at all can be a valid excuse to constantly watching us. The masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed.Orwell has written perhaps the most accessible account on Surveillance. And he has done that with chilling accuracy and inviting simplicity.Highly recommended."
2173,Taha Ibrahim,one of the most amazing books I've ever read offering a different view of how ideologies can be changed and used to serve those in power and how media can control people's mind. i think Orwell himself if he lived today wouldn't reach that point of perfection in describing the contradiction those in power have. last if anyone wants to read a different novel that offers a distinguished political view 1984 is your first choice.
2174,Kukkik W,"Haunting.This is the 'darkest' book I have ever read. It made me feel very depressed. I have no hope left for humankind, we are all doomed. Seriously though, I had a headache and felt sick after reading this (maybe it was because I sat for 5 hours finishing it) but I was hoping for Winston to save the day, that magically something or someone will pop up and save us all but it never happened, he just dies as a person (metaphorically - at least that's what I read from the ambiguous ending - he and his thoughts were killed by the bullet along before he was released). It always turns out all right in the end, but not in 1984.I've had this book for months and wish I had read it back then (I only read it now because we are going to study it for English class) because it's one of those books that changes the way you view the world and everything. I'm not sure I enjoyed it though, well I thought the beginning was great and very entertaining and then it just got more disturbing each chapter. It is frightening how realistic it is, despite it being a work of 'fiction' it is shockingly believable. George Orwell is a genius, he is a prophet.First I thought I was going to focus my revive on what a good read it was (expect for that tedious extract from 'The Book') but that's not the point, everyone should read 1984 because of what it has to warn us about. I do not know though how we can stop it from happening. But just like when Winston read 'The Book', this is all stuff we already know except worded for us on paper. You might be traumatised for the rest of your life but read it because it's better than not knowing!"

2176,Leti­cia Fagiani,"Como diz o Abdael, esse é o livro para se ler uma única vez.Em uma palavra: angustiante!Tive que fazer uma pausa e promover um afastamento emocional para conseguir ler todo o livro. São muitas reflexões levantadas e muitas inquietações despertadas sem nenhum cuidado.Orwell não está nem um pouco preocupado em ser cuidadoso ao tratar sobre como seria o futuro, levando em consideração as mudanças que estavam ocorrendo em sua época.O mundo era tão absolutamente controlado que o Orwell o descreve assim:“Como era possível fazer um apelo ao futuro, quando nem um rastro seu, nem mesmo uma palavra anônima rabiscada num pedaço de papel, tinha condições de sobreviver fisicamente?”Nesse futuro a memória individual não existe, as pessoas são levadas a ter uma memória coletiva, onde o Partido reescreve a história sempre a seu favor. Não sei você, mas tenho essa impressão algumas vezes, de me lembrar de um fato de uma maneira e todos a minha volta se lembrarem da mesma ocasião de uma forma diferente. É angustiante.Winston, o protagonista, está assim, só com suas memórias e se afogando na agonia de entender o que acontece e não poder fazer nada para se livrar ou livrar os outros. Ao se sentir assim, ele decide ser a oposição ao Grande Irmão, líder do Partido, seu pensamento é:“Não há a menor possibilidade de que ocorram mudanças perceptíveis em nossa geração. Nós somos os mortos. Nossa única vida genuína repousa no futuro.”Ele sabia que não poderia vencer o Partido agora, mas acreditava que poderia fazer parte de uma revolução, unido-se a uma organização que possibilitaria uma vida livre as outras gerações.Depois desse ponto, só lendo mesmo... não quero estragar a experiência de leitura de ninguém."

2181,Lawson Cox,"A Review of George Orwell’s Book: 1984In the years 1948 & 1949 George Orwell wrote a fantastic book about his prediction of how society would act and be governed. This book would soon go on to become one of the most awakening and eye-opening books of the twentieth century. It foretold of odd human characteristics that we would develop in the wake of a suppressive government, and Orwell does a brilliant job in his description of human weakness. Overall though, 1984 is a dark, depressing book with Orwell transposing his concerns and feelings through the point of view of the main character, Winston Smith, who struggles to keep sanity in a world where everything he believes and holds true is false. To make matters worse Winston lives in what is known as a “negative utopia.” Orwell does this to show a nightmarish reality, and to have the reader side with Winston’s point of view. Having read 1984 I believe that it should be rewarded five out of five stars.In the book 1984, Orwell discusses at length in a symbolic fashion about the struggles and weaknesses of humanity. Brilliantly orchestrated, he opened my mind to human fear. For example, relatively close to the end of the book he speaks of how humans have a fear that they will do everything in their power to relieve themselves from. I find this to be true. I think that everyone in this world has a fear that they wish will never come true. Orwell uses these fears to show how much power the government of 1984 has, and to show Winston’s ideas beginning to change in favor of how the Party says they should be. In Winston’s case his greatest fear was rats, and to get rid of being eaten alive by these rats he sacrifices Julia, the love of his life, to endure this pain. In this way, Orwell takes an intellectual and mental idea of everyday life, and symbolically explains it in a fictional story. Doing so, I believe Orwell made it clear for me to understand what he wanted to convey, and how he wanted the reader to feel. Another key concept to 1984 is how Orwell perceives the use of thinking, and thought process. In my opinion this was mind-blowing, I had never perceived thought in that manner. For example, much like in Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, Orwell speaks of what the majority thinks triumphs over the ideas of the minority. Such as if everyone in the world believed that two plus two equals five, and only a couple of people in the world know that it equals four, who’s actually right? For the world looks at the people who believe two plus two equals four as crazy and delusional, while the minority knows that they are right. In Alice in Wonderland, Alice comes to the conclusion that everyone in Wonderland is crazy and she’s the only normal one. However this idea is countered by the Cheshire Cat’s observation that if everyone is crazy and she is the only normal one, is she really normal or abnormal? How Orwell explains this idea and creates it into a story proves his masterful literary skills, and it sets up for a revolutionary concept to behold and ponder.In the end Orwell’s story combined with his ideas make up 1984’s hook; for it lured me into a new way of thinking while terrorizing me into believing the world of 1984 could become a possible reality. He sheds light on human weaknesses and fears showing possible ways an enemy can take advantage of the situation. He then in turn confronts the psychological and intellectual side of my brain causing me to question my thought process and somewhat confusing me at the same time. However much of the confusion is relieved by the well-paced storyline and the conflicts between characters. Overall, I am thankful that the world of Orwell’s 1984 did not become a reality, and that it is only a warning of how humanity needs to act. I was thrilled and terrified by the contents of that book, and without any hesitation would gladly award it with five out of five gold stars."
2182,Cel Kila,"J'ai commencé la lecture de ""1984"", ce classique sur lequel je ne m'étais encore jamais penchée, mardi soir. Autant dire que l'actualité qui sévit depuis mercredi, n'a fait que me plonger davantage dans ce roman de George Orwell, résonnant en moi d'une manière bien particulière. Tout ceux qui l'ont lu savent bien sûr de quoi je parle. ""1984"" a été écrit en 1949 et est un roman d'anticipation qui prend une toute autre ampleur des années après. George Orwell dépeint un monde totalitaire, dans lequel plus aucune liberté n'existe. Les libertés de s'exprimer, d'aimer et même de penser sont abolies. Les réfractaires s'exposent à un traitement particulier. Le ""Parti"" ré-invente l'Histoire, pour implanter toute sa puissance dans les cerveaux des... êtres vivants. Ils ne sont plus des hommes, juste des pions. On les place ici ou là, on leur dit ce qu'ils doivent penser et ce qu'ils doivent savoir. Les rapports entres les gens sont réduits à néant afin d'éviter toute conspiration, tout ""éclair de génie"" qui provoquerait la moindre réflexion sur ce qu'il se passe autour d'eux. Dans ce monde dans lequel les libertés sont systématiquement bafouées, nous suivons Winston, qui réfléchit, malgré lui. Ce roman d'anticipation se vérifie, inutile de le dire, dans l'histoire qui est la notre. Même si nous n'en arrivons pas à de tels extrêmes, ""1984"" nous fait penser que la frontière est mince entre la liberté et le totalitarisme, et que seule la voix de l'Homme peut faire basculer les choses. George Orwell nous fait penser qu'aucun rejet de la liberté ne doit être accepté, car un rejet, ouvre la voix à beaucoup d'autres. A méditer, à mettre entre toutes les mains. "
2183,Jessica D. Bicking,"Writing a review to a novel as critically acclaimed as Orwell's 1984 is a daunting task, as I feel no thought that I might possibly have about it, will quite suffice to express how well-crafted the novel really is. (So I won't even try to say anything clever, I'll use this space to catch some thoughts I have after reading, so that I can compare them with whatever I think the next time I come back to this book.)It is no question that it is and will remain as one of the most powerful warnings ever issued against the dangers of totalitarian authority.This morning, a night's sleep after I finished reading it, what's strongest in my thoughts though is 1984's penetrating analysis of the psychology of power, of history and of language. It's indication of what they respectively mean for the human condition.The gloomy ending leaves you with a pessimist outlook. Though democracy formally, supposedly won out the Cold War with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990's, 1984 does not seem exactly averted considering the state of the world at the moment (March 2014). And I wonder if Orwell was wrong insofar as the imminent danger is not only intrinsically political, but most of all intrinsically human.And personally, I guess I am hopelessly sentimental, I am a little troubled by and don't know what to make of the love in this book that has meant so little, made no different and was out of everyone's mind so casually. The ending, as a whole, is something that will need more thinking."
2184,Karla A.,"Creo que del canon distópico este es mi libro favorito. Sí, tenemos a Un mundo feliz, La naranja mecánica, Fahrenheit 451, pero ninguno logra un final tan opaco como este. Lo que más me atrapo, aparte de las descripciones de los ministerios y la relativización de la verdad, es que el amor se configura como la alternativa rebelde. Así, no es sólo una opción romántica como un camino hacia la libertad. Nótese cómo este libro realza el papel de la memoria histórica de los pueblos como vía de dominación, e igualmente cómo se construye el sentido común (algo que Raymond Williams explica muy bien en sus ensayos) "
2185,Riku Sayuj,"1984 & The Road to Wigan Pier: A Parallel AnalysisWhen The Road to Wigan Pier was commissioned, fortuitously in the period when Socialism was on the retreat and Fascism on the rise, Orwell must already have begun to glimpse the world which he was to envision with vigorous clarity in ‘1984’. This review is a dual review then, of ‘1984’ and of ‘The Road to Wigan Pier’.In The Road to Wigan Pier, written ostensibly as a documentary report on the life of the working classes in the industrial towns of england, Orwell uses his reportage to investigate two crucial questions: 1. Why class differences persist even when the means exist to destroy them2. Why socialism is failing practically and intellectually even as the moral facet (of it rectitude) is irrefutable (to his mind, at least)The reader has to be warned that The Road to Wigan Pier can seem a bit rambling (or circuitous!) at times but is in fact a tight composition and has been echoed by many writers since Orwell. The structure of the piece is quite elegant: In the first section, Orwell provides a direct detailing of the life in the ‘industrial towns’, of the proletariat, of the toiling classes. It is evocative and reminded me strongly of Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity in depth of detail and emotional involvement. It is a quick tour but captures the essential cruelties and degradation of life - rotten housing, lack of toilets, unemployment - and the complete hopelessness of it all. But just as Boo does later, Orwell also manages to convey that it is not due to the people, it is purely due to the conditions imposed on them. Orwell is very careful to drill this point home. It is the situations that make the classes.This is exactly what I expected from the title of the book though I had also been resigned to some amount of political commentary, Orwell being Orwell. But soon the real purpose of the book starts to take shape and for a while I felt disappointed. But Orwell soon reveals the purpose behind is autobiographical excursions in the second part of the book and now I have come to regard this second section as the most vital. It is a narrative technique which I am now starting to notice in a number of other authors trying to grapple with class differences, including Suketu Mehta in Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found, trying to come to terms with a riven Bombay.So, in this second, and to me most important, section, Orwell exposes his own biases and prejudices through a frank autobiographical study. He opens up his own upbringing to show how prejudices creep in and establish themselves in our psyche and never let go no matter ho hard we hammer at them. Situating himself as a symbol of the middle class, Orwell uses this sketch to convey how we are all prey to such class prejudices and that we need to work within our own limitations and especially of the one’s we are trying to convert to the specialist cause (by we, I mean the Left Book Club - the intended audience of the book). He uses the pungent example of ‘lower classes smell’ as an irrevocable class barrier. This has come under much criticism but it is important to keep in mind that it is only and example, he could have gone with the ‘non-pronouncement of the ‘H’s’ or any other minor but hard to avoid detail. To criticize the choice of detail is besides the point.Then comes the last section: the fulmination and the grand rhetoric. This section is the hardest to agree with and feels the most dated to the modern reader. Orwell tries to examine his second major point - Why is Socialism Declining? His answer is that it is because it is associated with mindless mechanized progress - due to the wrong instruments of propaganda which are turning away all the right sort of people and bringing only the ‘quacks’ into the socialist circles. Instead, to win the all-out and most important war against Fascism (which is, Orwell asserts, at the Gates), the Socialists need to forget class propaganda, accept that class prejudices will take longer to disappear (as elucidated in the previous section) and focus on the principles of ‘liberty’ and ‘justice’, which Orwell is sure will bring all the moral and intelligent people into Socialism. Only by asserting this moral core of Socialism, stripped of class propaganda, can the scales be tipped in favor of Socialism and away from Fascism. Now the humanistic picture of the depravations of the first section are resurrected in another light and Orwell presents both the class-proletariats as well as the ‘economic-proletariats’ (i.e, people like himself, born to a higher class but earning only the equal of a industrial worker), as mow likely to tend towards fascism, if for no other reason but self-preservation. Socialism needs to bring these classes into its fold. That is the crying need of the day.
""And then perhaps this misery of class-prejudice will fade away, and we of the sinking middle class … may sink without further struggles into the working class where we belong, and probably when we get there it will not be so dreadful as we feared, for, after all, we have nothing to lose but our aitches ('H's).""
The Literary Lens / The 1984 ReappraisalThe conclusions advocated by Orwell must seem too simplistic to modern ex-post readers, but there is another angle to be explored here that is not political in nature. This arises from the fact that this exposition was published before either 1984 or Animal Farm and after Brave New World. Orwell is quite clear that the Utopia (or Dystopia, or better, Utopia Caricatured) envisioned as the end goal of socialist progress in Brave New World is the very core of intelligent man’s revulsion towards Socialism - arising organically due to associations with ‘softness’ and degradation. Orwell needed to show the other extreme to turn this revulsion on its head.We often compare Brave New World and 1984 as if they were alternate predictions and give marks to Huxley for having predicted better. But this misses Orwell’s point. Orwell wanted to show the other extreme - the purely Fascist Dystopia - to bring around the people who were revolted by Brave New World and similar Utopian visions that were doing the rounds then (such as The Dream and Men Like Gods). Orwell calls these visions of the future that is based on mechanical progress as 
“the paradise of little fat men”
 which he admits was “aptly caricatured by Huxley in Brave New World”.You can also think of the caricature in the Wall-E movie for a better visualized reference. Orwell gives a grand argument, based on how the purpose of machines is to make human life easier and thus softer, to show how the Wall-E future is pretty much inevitable according to this conception of progress. He needed to present the antithesis to this vision - 1984. No matter how bad the caricature of the socialist progress, the Fascist one is surely the one to avoid. 1984 was the rubbing in of this idea, already set forth in 1937 with The Road to Wigan Pier, more than a decade before the fictional attack became unavoidable for Orwell.Thesis. Antithesis. Synthesis. 'Boom', said the Three Sisters.And, if we can claim that Orwell’s prophesy is today less imminent than Huxley’s, then Orwell wins the battle of ‘who can scare them most’. Well done, Orwell, you turned the course.Huxley, you needed to scare us more - we are headed there fast, still."
2186,Maddison,"'He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.'Edit: Changing my rating from a 4 to a 5, because I really haven't stopped thinking about this book since I finished it. So many fantastic ideas that really change the way you think about the world we live in, even today.So it's taken me a long time to get to this classic, but I'm so glad that I didn't read it any earlier in my life because I don't think I would have truly understood it if I was the younger version of myself. Or would I have? If I think that I could have, it would be true that I would have understood it, but if I continue to doubt my past self, then there is no way my past self would have understood it. It's all up to me in the moment. It's all in our minds anyway, right? I really enjoyed this, but I was a tiny, teeny bit disappointed. I guess I went into it assuming I knew all about it, and I was wrong so it was a little confusing and at times frustrating, but I'm probably more at fault then the book. It is true what they say though, this book is no less than terrifying. There's no doubt that Orwell is a genius. I found that I was continually doubting that this book was written in 1948. It seems like such a modern idea, it's hard to wrap your head around the fact that around the same time that Hitler's war had ended, someone was coming up with this idea for a novel. It just seems like so long ago, but it's such a newidea. See what I did there? The book, if you have not yet been forced to read this at school, or have chosen to pick it up on your own accord, is based around a totalitarian society in which is run by an ominous figure called Big Brother. Most things in this society are illegal, or in rations. There are government workers called 'The Thought Police', based off of the NKVD - a communist society in which brutally tortured the Jewish who were lead by Joseph Stalin. The Thought Police basically, as the name suggests, govern the thoughts of everyone in Oceania (England, America, Australia). If someone thinks or even dreams about something that is against Big Brothers government, they are taken away, and are 'turned into gas'. They basically become non-existent. Big Brother controls everything. He who controls the present controls the past, and so he has the power to erase these rebels from history, and his government has enough control to make sure that everyone in the community forgets about their existence as well. This is actually reminiscent of some propaganda that Stalin controlled wherein he removed those of power from images when they were killed off. It's really quite scary to think of how reminiscent this book and society if of our own. I think that's what makes the novel so terrifying. The sheer amount of power that Big Brothers government extends is incredible. They basically have the influence to be able to convince their people that 2+2=5. I believe that this notion is meant to be representative of the Communist party slogan from the second 'five-year plan' in which they hoped to accomplish the said 5 year plan in four years. They intend to make the impossible, possible, and they intend to make everyone around them believe that what they are doing is right, and is possible, and so they have complete power over the people's thoughts. Much like the party in the novel. I can't say I was a huge fan of the characters in this novel. I definitely didn't connect with them, but I honestly don't think that's really the intention. You're meant to see the flaws of these people that show evidence of past society's still being present in the totalitarian society. Just because Big Brother has this power over people, doesn't mean that they can be completely rid of their human urges. You can't wipe out centuries of human progression and human instinct so easily. You can enforce rules, but there really is no way to make people follow them. They will inevitably break these rules, no matter what the consequences are. We see this happen in the novel with one of the main plot points being the relationship between the protagonist, Winston Smith, and Anti-Sex Party co-operative, Julia. There relationship is illicit, firstly, because no two party members are allowed to be together, and secondly, because relationships can not be based on attraction. It is illegal for two people who are attracted to each other to be with each other, they must only remain together to reproduce to make future spies for the party. The party seeks to abolish the orgasm, and merely set dates for fornication, hoping to basically make sex a banal task one must do, but not look forward to. One thing I really loved was the mystery behind the Ministry of Love. It's set up as a place that's not happy, right from the beginning of the novel, but you just don't know what it is until the end, and it's such a great reveal. (view spoiler)[I love that the only form of 'love' is the love of Big Brother, and that is essentially the only reason why prisoners are forced into torture, for the forced love of their leader (hide spoiler)].I'm not sure if any of this made sense, or if I actually managed to say anything at all, it's late and I've had a long week so forgive pls. I could go on and on about the symbolism in this book, because it really is incredible, but I would go on for a long time. The social critique is amazing in this novel, and it really scares you. The imagery is extremely frightening. Highly recommend this book, even if you're not into classics. It's quite easy to read. "
2187,Najla,"This book is a hard read, especially for someone who is so use to reading contemporary books.. But i swear to you, once i was done with this book, nothing was the same, it changed my view on the world, it made a true impact, and now even when i look at a good place where everything is tidy, all think is ""what dark secrets are they hiding behind this perfect image"". This is the dystopian novel that beats all dystopian novels, i absolutely love it."
2188,Brian Stanton," How brilliant is Orwell. When Winston and Julia meet in the flat for coffee, cor i can almost smell it.Then when Winston gets to see himself after his punishment at the hands of Big Brother. The disgust at himself is almost too painful.And then the final act, the realisation before his finale.......amazing book.And Jees isnt this Room 101 way more scary than the Hancock/Merton one on the tv"
2189,Elizabeth A,"I listened to the audiobook, which is wonderfully narrated by Richard Brown.The really scary thing about this book, which was first published in 1949, is how accurately it describes so much of the world we live in today. This classic has been dissected in so many ways over the years, so I'm not sure I have anything new to contribute. My only regret is that I waited so long to read it. This book is bloody marvelous, and should be required reading for every citizen (no matter the country) every decade or so. "
2190,Drew Barth,"Dystopia? I bloody love dystopia, think I mentioned that in another review. Why specifically? No idea, one of those odd things that I can't really explain. But this, this book is one of the three that made me want to begin writing, pitched up with On the Road and Transmetropolitan, this was the first of those that I read back in ninth grade. Problem is, that was the last time I read it and proceeded to Brave New World soon after, so a few things may or may not be muddled up in this, and I apologize profusely for it now. I think nearly everyone has had to read it at some point and is passingly familiar with the main concept of it; the whole idea of the nation being at war with another, the monitoring of the population at large, the ten minute hate every morning, Smith's rebellion at the whole thing just from buying and recording in a journal, the proles, O'Brien, Julia, betrayal, room 101, etc. Hm, feeling just a bit more horrified when I thought of the room and the rat-cage on Winston's head than earlier, fantastic.But these would be nothing but concepts if it wasn't for Orwell's writing, that massively verbose prose, the density of the whole thing, to be so engrossed within a situation and know what the color of the carpet in the room Winston and Julia met in. If there has been anything from the novel I wanted to emulate in my own writing, it's that. Intricate detail on all things, setting a situation and setting in such a way to show the audience exactly what the writer sees. "
2191,Leena,"Full of intelligent metaphors, it scares yet comforts me!""to die hating them, that was freedom""."
2192,Masih,"It is a rightly acclaimed novel written by the author of animal farm. Its story is based on socialism and its consequences on individual freedom and their lifestyle. Orwell, the author, depicts the medium, characters and events very graphically and makes its audience feel the experience of being inside such an oppressed society and to sympathize with the main character of the novel, Smith, whose mind is in lunacy compared to the main beliefs of others. The special inventive wording like doublethink, black-withe, crime-stop and etc. is very succinct and clear to describe the concepts and mentality of the dictatorship imposed by the party. I read the book with enough deliberation after each chapter as to understand the beauty and perfection of the story-telling faculty of Orwell. The ending appeared to me as very clever, unpredictable and in accordance with the point of the story, and not using unnecessary dramas. The real dramas were the living style and dominion of individuals in a dictatorial social party. "

Rating Clarification: ★★★★★
It is difficult for me to translate my sheer wonder and love of this book into words, but I'll try. This book is one of the most beautiful, chilling, and haunting pieces of literature I have ever read. Orwell's writing style is captivating; the characters are complex; and the world scarily resembles our own. Those things don't begin to cover why I love the book, though. There are so many reasons, too many to count, that this book has stood the test of time and so many reasons why it is important to read. Anyway, I've decided to split this review into sections so that my thoughts will make some amount of sense. Here goes.Plot:The plot of 1984 is simplistic, maybe even a little cliche. It's simply about a totalitarian society that oppresses and brain washes it's people. At least that's what it seems like until you delve into the book. Orwell has created a world as complex as our own. We are never given answers to some questions about the society, and neither is the main character. We are shocked by some of the answers, just like Winston. And some we see coming. The point is that the plot seems simple enough until you get into the book and then it thickens with each page. And the terrifying thing about the plot is that while it is extreme, it so closely resembles our society that you can almost start to forget that this is a dystopian. It's pretty creepy and had me wondering where we would be in a couple dozen years. This plot is unlike anything I have read before, and I think it's richly developed and easy to believe.Characters:There are a wide array of characters in this book, but the focus of the book is really a character study on Julia and Winston, who are both dynamic characters that change often throughout the story. The thing about these characters is that they are both so unlikable that they become likable. They are complex, realistic characters with motives and emotions that feel so real that it's like you know them. Honestly, this book has some of the most realistic characters I have ever read about. They have flaws, but one thing ties Julia and Winston together: their love. It is heart-wrenching to watch what happens to that emotion as the book progresses. Even if this book is not a romance at heart, the love between Winston and Julia is poignant and quite easy to believe. I also thought that the antagonists were interesting characters, and I think that they can even be sympathized with. They are simply products of the society that they were raised in, and while you hate them, you feel bad for them too.I would do more aspects, but in all honesty their are simply too many and I think that this stories main aspect is the characters and plot. So, what is the moral of 1984? I think that it could be perceived in many ways, but that Orwell's main message is the dangers of a society that oppresses it's people. I think that this book is meant to be a guide, to show us what we need to do so that our society does not become this. That message comes across very well and I believe that Orwell had the right idea. We must save our society before it is too late, and that's what 1984 is telling us. So I think that this is an essential book for everyone to read and hope that all of the people that haven't given it a shot do. It's well worth the read! "

The few breaks I was forced to take due to family functions left me feeling like a crazy person because I was trying to process the whole thing and was terrified of this ""future"" Orwell predicted. Then I realized that Huxley, at this point, is more correct, so I felt a little better. But whatever my state of mind was as I read it, my brain cast it well. Martin Freeman as Winston, Zooey Deschanel and I traded off as Julia, and O'Brien was, well...I will never look at him the same way again, let me tell you. I was terrified. "

2198,John Baek,"This novel was truly prophetic, predicting the power of the modern NSA after the attack on the Twin Towers. The style was primarily didactic, I felt, written like an essay, but the novel was mostly political and didactic. I wouldn't say it was necessarily entertaining like the Percy Jackson books, but it was definitely eye-opening.To think! How far in advance Orwell predicted such a dystopia - or, at least, a modicum of security and intrusion into privacy - in the early 20th century, about 1984.I have not read Brave New World or The Handmaid's Tale, but surely, this would rank among those two."
2199,Adam Denny,"The story of the creation of hell on Earth, because that was easier to achieve than paradise. This hell is one of imagination and memory. In 1984 no one remembers if the world was ever a better place. The old books are all gone, destroyed or revised by the Party and Big Brother, and the English Language is about to go the same way. Winston Smith wants to rebel, but he isn't sure of either what he is rebelling against, or for. I last read this novel in high school, and as a teenager what went over my head was just how fallible Winston and Julia were. They are not rebelling for the greater good, but because they are bored of their lives as Outer Party members, totally devoid of any passion accept for hate.Orwell's description of how technology is used to erode privacy is more relevant than ever. Newspeak could have been invented for the Internet, cameras and microphones are already everywhere; substitute drones for helicopters. How the most violent and gory images of the Boston Bombings were pushed into our faces, whether we liked it or not, implied what we consider to be privacy is changing, and people are becoming desensitized to the extremes of violence. Orwell's descriptions of ultra-violent newsreels could have been written in response to our world, not six decades before it."
2200,Augustine  of Elsinore,"Little could be written for a novel like this. Even from the beginning, one has the feeling of reading something epic; something so great and above him/herself, that will surely stay with him/her after finishing the novel, which I assure you it's totally true. Poetically written and politically composed, 1984 is at the same time a prophecy concerning the immediate future society, our own society of surveillance, betrayals, brainwashing, of unsaturated consummation and genuine imperialism, as well as an allegory of past societies. Orwell created one of the best dystopian and sci-fi novels about a politically deranged world-- consequently it's only fair to argue that he influenced every similar novel of the 20th and the 21th century. A harbinger of the future humanity deprived of love, imagination, free will and independence, 1984 illustrates the story of Winston Smith, his thoughts and experiences in Big Brother's lunatic nation. Well done Mr. Orwell, your last novel couldn't be more appropriate. Thank you for offering it to us. "
2201,Ashley,"1984 by George Orwell is a rather intriguing and complex novel. It takes place in a futuristic, yet dystopian setting. Due to continual involvement in wars and bombings, the inhabitants of the country Oceania are living amongst poor conditions and are being monitored at all times by Big Brother. Big Brother happens to be the face of the Party, which holds the power over citizens. The main character, Winston Smith, is an average man that works as a records editor. He drinks and smokes to escape any paranoia or worries he encounters. Despite the fact that his every move is monitored, he rebels and starts creating a personal diary, which is against the law. Later he rebels even more by sneaking around with a young woman named Julia. They fall in love and find a place to meet up with each other. They decide to rebel against the Party and Big Brother together. Meanwhile, a member of the Inner Party, O'Brien, introduces Winston to the doctrines of the Party. O'Brien turns out to be an enemy of Winston and turns him and Julia in. It turns out that Winston and Julia weren't as discreet as they thought they were. Both are separated, tortured, and forced to save themselves by turning against each other. In the end, they see each other again, but they've basically been scarred and changed for life. The novel is actually more dense than it may seem due to the many accounts of symbolism, allusions, imagery, and themes. It contains themes of love, violence, manipulation, technology, betrayal, power, and rebellion. Big Brother symbolizes a god-like, omniscient being. Its ironic because its not proven that Big Brother actually exists in the story. "
2202,Erdenesuvd Bat-Erdene,"The first fact about this book that fascinated me was that the book was published in 1949. How can Orwell see this far this accurately? It almost scares me and makes me awe him.The second fact that makes the book still relevant is the fact that a country which abides the rules of strict communism still exists here on earth today, North Korea. I have read ""Nothing to Envy"" by Barbara Demick which introduced me to the current state of this country. And the knowledge of the state and the book clearly coincided. North Korea is strictly following the rules in 1984 to keep the citizens under control by controlling their minds and souls.The third fact that made the book revolutionary is that it inspired thousands of books and movies which consists of tortured brainwashing which makes the audience doubt reality.A powerful heart shattering book.Became one of my faves :)))"

2204,Maria  (Scratchbook),"1984 è considerato il romanzo distopico per antonomasia, ritratto di una società quanto più negativa possa mai esistere. Ed, in effetti, non c’è accenno di speranza nel testo, non c’è possibilità. Non c’è luce.

2206,Alain Lou,"George Orwell's ""1984"" was a carefully thought out book, and it presents both an interesting and thought provoking storyline. This book succeeds as both an argument against communism and as a dystopian narrative. George Orwell carefully creates the book's events, and has perfect control over diction. Orwell furthermore spares no expense at creating a realistic scenario, complete with slogans, songs, and memories. This story has hooked me from the very start, and in the end, has completely changed my philosophy. I genuinely enjoyed reading this book. I hope this isn't THOUGHTCRIME."

2208,Nikhil Jain,"Usually, I am not wont to scrutinize and analyse a book that I've just read, or even to ponder upon the implications of what I read at some further time. It is, as if, I concern myself only with the immediate story, exploring, if ever, only the peripheries that are necessary towards the continuation of suspended disbelief. I have often taken pride in such a procedure since it removes me from questioning the motives of the author, and therefore, in a manner, preserving the dignity of the literature. A deluded belief, perhaps, nonetheless extremely effective since it is self moralizing.It is for that reason, and the profoundest sense of having done myself wrong- even wasting a considerable portion of time and resources, that I find myself to be inspired. I have felt, in the manner Orwell writes (and I might be misquoting, although the essence is preserved), that inspiration lies in reading what you already know. It is, as if an invisible veil is suddenly lifted from your eyes, and in that moment when you read or hear words from an external source- words that describe that feeling buried inside of you, that you know you have been lying to yourself.Well, George, you've done it.DOUBLETHINK, and to even consider this seemingly childish word to ever produce such a resonance inside your head, like a flooding crescendo- you can only term it profound. Centuries have passed since men worshiped superstition, believed wholeheartedly that the sun and the moon are the eyes of a giant cat (?) while simultaneously knowing that they are Gods that have to be sacrificed to, dictating the fates of their lives. I took it as a curious oddity, an entertaining fact that can be supplied when a conversation gets too dull- a plaything not fit to be pondered upon, for how can it be possible for one to think so?Stop it, George.Why should it matter, what these so-called powers on top do as long as it doesn't affect my life? After all, if it doesn't really stop me from smoking the occasional (?) cigarette, who am I to whine about the supposed oppression? Now, before you start to think that I've turned into some crazy conspiracy-theory belching lunatic, I would like to put your unnecessary apprehensions to an end. I have not. But indeed, one is forced to manufacture scenarios and draw analogies when they read-“The masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed.” In other words, one is forced to wonder.Now why, you ask, is Orwell a genius?First of all, I never said so, but let us work under the assumption that I did. Now all we have to do is prove why he is one. After I completed the book, the first question that came to my mind was- Why did Winston have to die? After all, if he has come to love the Big B, why should he not continue to live and thus +1 the self-deluded populace? Which led me to wonder whether this was the ultimate aim of the Party- to die in service of BB, or at least, the ideals that he stood for. I immediately rubbished that explanation- but wait- I didn't. Perhaps, it is the fact that Winston has betrayed Da Brotha' (forgive me, but I can't help but think of BB with a twinge of mockery) that sets an example to the party and Winston himself, because that is what they are striving at- thought control, that betrayal of the Party's doctrine is tantamount to extinction. The genius is in the fact that not only the individual, but the Party itself will believe so. A snake eating its own tail, eh?Alright, now that I think of it, I'm not going to list down all the reasons that point towards Georgie's supposedly high IQ. Believe what you want.Now, why do any of it?This, I still don't understand. There is still a lot of time for me to understand why, because frankly, Junior couldn't convince me on that, unless I die, that is.Okay."
2209,melmarian,"Welcome to Oceania. A world where Big Brother rules over everything and dictates everything. A world where WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. A world where you’re being watched 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A world where there is no place for individualism and freedom to think, to act, to speak. A world where humanity is dead. George Orwell wrote this literary political and dystopian science-fiction novel as a grim picture of the future. Through this sharp satire to totalitarianism, Orwell pointed out the danger of dictatorial government whether it is left or right ideology in a depressing, frightening, and unimaginable description of Oceania, Ingsoc, Newspeak language, the concept of doublethink, and Big Brother himself. The book that has been widely banned for its controversial ideas is in the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die list. And do I, as a reader, agree that Nineteen-Eighty Four should be read before I die? The answer is yes.

2216,Faisal Alami,"Hands down one of the greatest and most influential pieces of literature this century, and if not all time. George Orwell is most definitely a man who challenges the current state of ""order"" in our countries' governments and is skeptical about their decisions and this book is the epitome of his beliefs. It is unorthodox, and it provides such a vivid, notorious, thought provoking image of a dystopian world that suffers from totalitarianism.The political themes which constantly appear in this book like the question of dictatorship or democracy, as well as freedom or security are constantly appealed to throughout the book and as you read along you reminisce to these themes, and relate them to the political issues of today enhancing the reading process. Winston's character experiences a massive change in personality and it shows the contrast of one who is not afraid to stand up for his rights and to have his/her own opinion and merely a sheep who mindlessly obeys the government. This book brings up so many political and ethical questions that it gauges the reader to keep going as they get sucked into this totalitarian dystopia. A classic that everyone should have on their shelves"

2218,Tyler McHaley,"Though I knew quite a bit about the story in 1984 from popular literature and culture, I have never sat down actually read the book entirely through. I thought it was quite good, bordering on phenomenal, considering the prescience Orwell shows with his writing in view of society in the very near future. For a book with only three primary characters, I found myself quite riveted to the story. Moreover, I definitely think it speaks to our society today. Some would argue--and I might be one of them--that you could take the phrase, ""Big Brother is watching you,"" and replace the notion of Big Brother with the NSA, CIA, or any number of other alphabets soup agencies in charge of intelligentsia within our government. That is an entirely different discussion but one this book begins to unravel for us.Nonetheless, I was very pleased with the book. I thought Orwell did a good job of communicating the story, giving background, and saving the very provocative moments for the end. The book does evoke many emotional reactions from the reader, and I thought Orwell was very careful in crafting the story to reveal just enough at the appropriate times for the reader not to become jaded about the outcome, even if it were already known.It's a shame Orwell died at such a young age. I think he could have contributed much more to the world literature in general as well as specifically to the idea of an encroaching government that does not have the well-being of its citizens as its primary purpose. I recommend this book for people who are not afraid to look into a future where power truly has corrupted completely but does not also offer the reader a soft place to land."
2219,Noha Abdel-Tawab,Simply brilliant!Utterly deep and true.
2220,Kati,"1984 was a book I had to read for my senior English class. I was super excited to read this book and though it ended up totally shocking me, it was very good. I knew the basic story of this book: a corrupt government that spies on it's citizens, but it goes so much deeper than that. This government completely manipulates and brainwashes these people and there's absolutely nothing they can do about it. If they even think about going against their leader, Big Brother, they get tortured and killed. It was all just so sad, but amazingly written.Even though this book was really good, I do not recommend it for everyone. There is quite a bit of violence and some sexually explicit moments. But that's what gives it it's really amazing a raw elements. So if you feel you're emotionally mature I say go and pick up this book! Not only will you read an awesome book, but you will also learn a lot about different types of governments and how people in different countries are treated so poorly."
2221,Mostafa Geraw,لو كان فيه نجوم تاني كنت بلا تردد اديها للكتاب دهاكتر حاجه شدتني ليه كانت المنطقية والسلاسة اللي اتعرض بيها وتحس فعلا انه مبيتكلمش اي كلام .. لا ده بيحكي عن واقع فعلي معاش .. لمده طويله بلدنا المنكوبه عاشت الى حد كبير في عالم اوقيانيا وماذالت تعيشلو كان هناك امل فهو بالتأكيد ليس في عموم الناس .. الجماهير المصرية الحالية بالضبط زي العامه في اوقياينا لا هم لها سو الاكل والشرب والجنس والنوم المصير معتم لاى ابعد الحدود لا نقنط من روح الله ولكن نقنط من أهل مصر
2222,Jason Lundberg,"There are very few writers whose work have been so profound that their names have become adjectives. Shakespearean. Kafkaesque. Orwellian.1984 remains George Orwell's greatest legacy, a fact shared by Roberto Bolaño's novel 2666; both books with a four-digit number as the title, both written frantically by authors who knew they were dying, both profound in their exploration of human cruelty, both lifting the veil of propaganda and rhetoric to get to the Truth underneath.I try to re-read 1984 every few years or so, so as never to forget Orwell's powerful message (We Must Not Let This Future Come To Pass), and to rekindle the tingling literary joy I experienced when I was first exposed to the book in my last year of high school. The clandestine budding romance between Winston and Julia; the ever-present terror evoked by the telescreens and the Thought Police; the Party's final solution of engineering humanity out of every human being; the hope and optimism that lives in Winston's heart, which is then crushed by O'Brien in the Ministry of Love's Room 101, and which returns, oddly enough, in the form of the book's appendix on Newspeak.Totalitarianism is still very much a reality around the world, with civil liberties always under attack, and so it's important to keep the nightmare world of Oceania and Airstrip One alive in the mind. One must be ever vigilant for signs of the watchful eyes of the Thought Police in CCTV cameras and internet wiretapping, of the destruction of language resulting from devolution into contextless acronyms and SMS-speak, of the censorious invasion into our very minds by authoritarian and corporate influence.1984 can only be described as a tragedy. Boy finds girl, boy loses girl, boy loses self. With the final lines, Winston Smith gloriously professes his love for Big Brother and thereby takes the final step in becoming an unperson, but his suffering and rebellion serve as inspiration for us all to never take our lives and freedom for granted. Orwell's literary sacrifice of his most human protagonist remains one of the greatest contributions to the world of letters and to the continuing species of humanity."
2223,Gary,"George Orwell’s 1984 was mandatory reading during my schooling, and typically assume most students educated in North America have encountered it by the time they're out, so I was surprised to see it end up on the iO9's list of sci-fi books that people claim to have read, but haven't actually. Written shortly after World War II as the world was becoming increasingly polarized between the burgeoning superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union, the book is set in the dystopian future of 1984 where the world finds itself pitted between three warring superpowers and is a go-to in not only English courses, but finds its way into History, and Political Science courses from High School all the way up into University. Told from the POV of a government bureaucrat from the Ministry of Truth – responsible for the daily barrage of propaganda leveled against their populace to maintain support of the war effort – it chronicles his struggles to embrace an individual identity in a society that demands total obedience to the Party and adherence to their narrative as it shifts to meet the government’s ever fluctuating needs. Despite this being written in the context of the “Soviet menace,” the observations made in 1984 are as important now as they were then, as we bear witness to our present day struggles with personal privacies and governments actively changing history to better align the narrative with their political agendas, and how easily technology can be used to facilitate such. Definitely a must for everyone to read regardless of any personal preferences they might have.http://www.cultureaddicthistorynerd.c..."
2224,Erica (LibrettoReviews),"1984 di George Orwell, pseudonimo di Eric Arthur Blaire, viene pubblicato per la prima volta nel 1949, un’anno prima della morte dell’autore affetto da tisi. Non riesco a capacitarmi di come nello scrivere questo libro ci abbia visto lungo, raccontando di un mondo immaginario che noi adesso definiremmo dispotico, in una Londra distrutta dove il Partito, con a capo il Grande Fratello, controlla, osserva e spia ogni tua mossa attraverso i TELESCHERMI, presenti ovunque e impossibili da spegnere e inculca nella mentre delle persone la politica del partito :LA GUERRA È PACELA LIBERTÀ È SCHIAVITÙL’IGNORANZA È FORZAUn mondo dove nulla è illegale ma quasi tutto è sconsigliato. Il pensare è ridotto al minino, la NEOLINGUA, istituita per ridurre al minino il numero delle parole, si sostituisce all’inglese, nessuno è amico ma tutti sono compagni, pronti a denunciarti al primo segno di disaccordo contro il Partito. Un mondo orribile e opprimente, dove le gioie della vita e gli istinti stessi dell’uomo, i sentimenti e i pensiero sono aboliti . Ma Winston , il protagonista del libro è una piccola lucina di speranza in mezzo al buio che avanza , convinto che prima o poi il mondo e l’umanità riuscirà a risollevarsi , che ci sia ancora una speranza e che essa risieda tra i PROLET. Il popolino, gli esclusi, considerati al pari degli animali e di sprezzati da quelli del partito come Winston, ma che sono gli unici che ancora conservano l’umanità che il Grande Fratello vuole cancellare dal mondo e sostituire con l’odio.Se c’è una speranza questa, risiede fra i Prolet. Finché non diventeranno coscienti della loro forza, non si ribelleranno e, finché non si ribelleranno, non divertano coscienti della loro forza.Il problema dei prolet però secondo Winston é che , in un mondo che brucia, essi non riescano ad avere una visione generale dei fatti. Indignandosi per le cose sbagliate e ignorando i problemi più grandi. Vi richiama alla mente qualcosa?Ci sarebbe da scrivere pagine e pagine su questo libro, tematiche che vanno dal Tempo al Sesso, dalla Famiglia alla Fedeltà, ma il libro è così importante e famoso che sono sicura che troverete online analisi migliori e più estese della mia. Non so perché io non abbia mai letto questo libro, perché non me l’abbiano mai proposto al liceo. Sarebbe interessante far fare un raffronto ai 18enni d’oggi tra il mondo di questo libro e la realtà attuale. Penso che, come è successo a me, aprirebbe molte menti e si scaverebbe una nicchia nel profondo della mente di ciascuno per riproporsi in continuazione.Ultimamente i libri e film ambientati in mondi post apocalittici si sprecano, mondi distopici dove la società lotta contro un tiranno. Tutti hanno sentito parlare della saga degli Hunger Games e sicuramente tutti hanno o letto i libri o visto i film. Bene, se questa comparazione mi è concessa, 1984 è la versione seria di quello che sarebbe Panem in una realtà priva di illusioni e lieti fini, perché non tutte le storie ne hanno uno.Chiaramente è un libro che DEVE essere letto.Non ci sono condizioni , ne pecche o critiche.Erica"
2225,❅ Eze ❅,"Con este termino mi re-lectura de la trilogia distopica: 1984 es por lejos el mejor de los tres, muy constante, no tiene partes excesivamente aburridas como los otros y un muy buen final; no solo se habla de fascismo, este libro critica el comunismo y otras formas de gobierno poniendo todas a la misma altura. A ""Fahrenheit 451"" le falta imaginacion, ""Un Mundo Feliz"" decae en la mitad y el final es horroroso, por eso este libro es la lectura definitiva de los tres."
2226,Zach Paulson,"1984 is a perfect example of what our world would look like if we had a nuclear war. Winston Smith, the protagonist of this story, finds himself wondering about the past. This drives him into the idea that everything that is normal in Oceania is wrong. He begins keeping a diary of everything he can think of about the past. As the story goes on he falls in love with another girl who hates Big Brother, the dictator of Oceania. They then find a secret oraganization against Big Brother and begin scheming. The story isn't all roses though something bad happens to them but you'll have to read it to find out what."
2227,Martin Bergchauzen,"This book it's so good. The climate of book it's dark and some scary. The main hero is called Winston. Winston is a office worker in government institute. He feels that something wrong in his life. He don't know what is wrong, but he feel that.Winston live in a very safe country. The country has main idea called ""big brother"".Winston life in this country is very hard because he is be observed 24h per day.All people in this country are observed 24h per day and they have a very small freedom.Winston bought a pen and notebook and he is trying write a diary. And the story is beginning..."
2228,Al Simpson,One of the most gripping and influential books I've read.
2229,Pouria,همه جای کتاب خوب بود . خیلی خوب پیش رفت ، اوج گرفت و فوق‌العاده تموم شد . طی خوندنش همه‌ی فکر آدم بهش جذب میشد و توش غرق میشد و تو دنیای 1984 فرو میرفت . یک شاهکار که باید هرکسی بخونه . 
2230,سامح شاهين,أجد صعوبة فى شرح أثر هذه الرواية على إلا أنها بإختصار جعلتنى أشعر بالإعياء! ولا أدرى هل كان جورج أورويل يتنبأ بالمستقبل أم أن الماضى والمستقبل سيان؟!إعلام كاذب.. تاريخ مزور ..صناعة أبطال من ورق وتحويل الأبطال إلى ورق .. إلهاء الشعوب .. فرق تسد .. خلق عدو لإلقاء المسئولية عليه .. افتقاد الحياة للروح بإفتقاد الحب والمشاعر التى تنزع من البشر وشعور الكثيرين بأن ذلك بمثابة ضعف وعيب فى شخصياتهم مع أن العيب هو العكس .. ضياع الإنسان!ورغم كل هذه القتامة وحالة الإعياء إلا أن هذه الرواية تستحق القراءة لمن أراد فهم ما حدث وما يحدث وما سيحدث فتتغير الحكومات والأنظمة إلا أن الكتالوج واحد!
2231,Toby Kim,"Overall excellent read. Five out of five for sure.1984 written by the mastermind, George Orwell was published in 1949. Approximately sixty years ago. It's been a long time since it was out. Well, it still doesn't fail to deliver. A short summary: The main character feels that the government is doing something very wrong and tries to create a revolution to stop it.Pros: Excellent use of vocabulary. Seen many new words throughout and learned many things. Easily believable setting. Everything from the first page to the last page resembles a real world. One of the three FIRST ""dystopian"" novels. MEANING, ALL BOOKS SUCH AS DIVERGENT, MAZE RUNNER, THE GIVER AND MANY MANY MORE WERE INFLUENCE BY THIS BOOK! AND THIS BOOK STILL BLOWS MOST OF THEM OUT OF THE WATER! A prediction that's probably going to become the truth. The fact that many people are losing their human qualities such as sociality through virtual social medias and gratitude through tumblr or instagram alarms me and makes me question, 'will our world become like the world Orwell in imagined?'Cons: Quite confusing at the front.  Some pages such as 200~230 were just plain ""research papers."" They were quite hard to read. Theme... Not really, more of a warning to mankind: Unless all humans stands up and try to make a change, all will lose human qualities (love, thankfulness, bond between parents and children) without even noticing it. I recommend this book to all people. Especially the ones looking for a CHALLENGING read with some insane plot and true outlook of the world (it is quite inappropriate so be sure that you are not sensitive of the matter)."
2232,Theophilus (Theo),"After all of these years, still very good. How did Orwell know what we would come to in the twenty-first century? Constant warfare with some vague Eastern enemy. Fear, hate, and a government that spies on its own citizens? It's for our own good and to ensure the defeat our enemies."
2233,Oleksii,By having this book read you won't be the same ever
2234,Kristija Sejane,"The book was memorable, to this day it is very fresh in my mind. Although some part of the book are rather long and unnecessary, I did enjoy this book overall. It is definitely a book you must read before you die!"
2235,Nils Jeppe,"Absolute classic, and more relevant today than ever - after all we do live in an age where every notebook has a webcam, countless living rooms have Kinect cameras, there is CCTV at every street corner, the government is spying on calls and emails at an unprecedented rate, and the amount of computing power we have available actually makes it possible to completely analyze peoples' behavior. 1984 is an absolute MUST read for everybody.And it's well-written, too."
2236,Liselore,"This book gave me the chills. It really makes you think about society, and about how much of the news that reaches us is actually true."
2237,Nathan,"Orwell was right, he was just 20 years off. (I stole that line from Christopher Hitchens, I admit it.) Probably one of the most important books of the 20th Century, and I have no idea how to review it properly.NC"
2238,Andrea Eliza,The book that began my love of dystopians. 
2239,Marcus Barham,"1984 was a great read. It was very intense in many spurts. This book affected me because even though it was written in 1948 it had brains behind it like it was written in the 2000’s. This book is so advanced because it sort of represents our government today. Our government watches and monitors many things, just like this book. Unlike the book our government does not watch us as much so we at least have a little bit of privacy unlike the characters. Society today would comment as in how realistic and how it pertains to today’s lifestyle. All the cameras or telescreens watching people. The books intended audience is to every common person because they do not want the government to have complete power over the citizens. The setting is crazy and has people watching when they don’t even know. This eliminates free thought and creativity, so people do not know what to do."
2240,مالك الرفاعي,"رواية 1984 الرواية الكنز .___"" لا يمكنهم أن يبلغوا ذلك، فذلك هو الشيء الوحيد الذي لا يستطيعونه، إذ بوسعهم أن يُكرهوك على قول أي شيء يُريدونه، لكنّهم لا يستطيعون إكراهك على أن تؤمن بما تقوله، فليس لهم سلطة ينفذون بها إلى كيانك "". __تحقّقت أملك يا أورويل فالعامة بدأوا بإحداث التغيير الذي استعصى طيلة عقود طويلةً وصرخوا بوجه ( القائد ) ( الأخ الكبير ) .. فلتسقط .. هي الرواية الكنز الّتي لا تبلى ولا تفقد قيمتها أبداً وتظلّ دهراً راسخة المبدأ وتحضّ على الثورة في وجه كلّ اشكال الكذب والتزييف والتأليه التي تخضع لها الشعوب المحكومة بقبضة ( الأحزاب والجنرالات والأشخاص ) حتّى ولو طال الوقت لابد في النهاية أن يسير كل شيء بخير . "
2241,Will Moore,"Well this is my favorite book, so I won't gush, but seriously this is the dystopian future story to start it all, freaking Terminator* wouldn't exist if it wasn't for this story (sort of), Orwell's writing is amazing, the world of 1984 is both compelling and terrifying and it makes the reader really question the importance of free will, and Big goddamn Brother! God this book is perfect, the highlight of my time in education was getting to write about this beautiful beautiful book for my A-Level coursework so yeah 10/10, A+, 5 shiny golden starts whatever you want, just read it*and that kickass Apple advert from the 80s, you know the one"
2242,Rob Taylor,"This might be one of the scariest books I have ever read. Power for the sake of power. Though I am certain that my friends who do not embrace any type of theism will grouse at this, I can't conceive of much else outside of theism but power for the sake of power. It might be said that theism in its various strains is a means to power for the sake of power. It can certainly be used for that. How far are you willing to go to impose your concept of good upon people? I sense that if we are willing to go much outside of the marketplace of ideas, where -ologies and -isms can be bought and sold freely, then we are no longer interested in promoting a good as much as we are interested in obtaining power for the sake of power, that is, controlling others by force.Someone is going to have a monopoly on power. Organized society requires that someone have responsibility for the sword. This being the case we need to endeavor to make sure that that monopoly is governed from without and within and easily toppled. Man, this book scares the crap out of me."
2243,Nour elEman Osama El Borno,I wish I could give it more than 5 stars. I feel speechless. SPEECHLESS. I do have one thing to say: I BELIEVE that no matter what 2+2=4.
2244,Belal Gaza,"In a world where two plus two must equal five, a man dares to believe that the answer is four.In this novel Orwell describes a world ruled in such way that man and animals became much alike. The tableaus he used and the terms he coined all testify to the ingeniousness of the writer. And to his cleverness, Orwell manages to completely shock the reader when a moment which was evidently expected since the early first chapter comes, with one simple line, as chilling as a sentence could ever be:""You're the dead""."
2245,فاروق الفرشيشي,"When you finish reading 1984 for the first time, you'd feel like lost in yourself, consumed with a massiveness of ideas and questions.. You'd feel sorry for yourself being a part of such horrible world, and you can see every little detail of the novel all around you.1984 seems to talk about dictatorship and regimes claiming revolution, but truth is, you can't see any difference between these regime and any what-so-called democratic regime.IngSoc = Democracy.BigBrother = Peace MakersInner Party = International CompaniesDoublethink = public opinionTelescreen = Broadcasting companiesThoughtcrimes = anti-Semitism, wikileaks, open-data, hack-activism, etc.It's no more about fear, hatred and negative thoughts. Power seekers, have found better tools to keep their control over the world. They are founding a whole system in which some men have choice, feel free, are well fed and educated, but know nothing about the other men, they don't know that they have better life level because others are starving, they don't even care..But, I don't blame Big Brother, I do blame Winston, because he was weak, because he didn't believe in the truth, he was just believing in himself.To be read over and over again."
2246,Maheswaran,"There were many parts of it which just blow your mind away. A simple read but with many thought provoking sentences and situations. There were some parts which I did not enjoy much and would most likely give a 4. Especially the one where he is reading The Book. But the other sections before and after outweigh this. I was thinking more and more about each thing that happens in this book as I read it. ""Is it happening now. "", ""Can this happen in the future?"" Negative Utopia by torture and psych control. Would remain relevant for many years. Note to self - should read the other negative Utopian books. "
2247,Pang,"I just loved this book! I couldn't hardly stay away from it during the last 100 pages or so. It was captivating, fascinating, and thought-poking. I don't think you have to be a conspiracy theorist to like this book. It, however, does make you think about our government; not just the US, but government in general. Politics is all about power, specifically who has the power. One of a government's purposes is to provide law and order, and, I believe, that gives way to some form of controls. As in the case of 1984, the society has four ministries: Truth, Peace, Love, and Plenty. We can see the parallel between these ministries and real-life functions of the government. Information is filtered through the government in ""as-needed"" manners. Nobody knows for sure what is considered to be ""real,"" not even the government itself. Or information is delayed, so that by the time it's released it wouldn't matter as much. Orwell cursed the capitalists, but he acknowledged that socialism wasn't the way. Government lied about what goods were being made. And goods being made were not what the society needed (e.g., they needed razor, but that wasn't being manufactured; bootlaces were.) Oh, I can go on! : )I was rooting for Winston toward the end of the book. I didn't want him to break down. I couldn't help but felt sad for him. He wasn't able to feel love... wasn't able to experience regrets or grief (over his mother):Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows.He fell in love with Julia. It was real to him. He was happy. And I think that he tried so hard to cling on to that love... It was like he put her and his love for her on a pedestal. In the end Big Brother succeeded, and he broke down. It was truly sad to me. ""Sometimes,"" she said, ""they threaten you with something--something you can't stand up to, can't even think about. And then you say, 'Don't do it to me, do it to somebody else, do it to so-and-so.' And perhaps you might pretend, afterwards, that it was only a track and that you just said it to make them stop and didn't really mean it. But that isn't true. At the time when it happens you do mean it. You think there's no other way of saving yourself, and you're quite ready to save yourself that way. You want it to happen to the other person. You don't give a damn what they suffer. All you care about is yourself.""His love was ideology. I felt like that was how many government turn one group against another... whether in a civil war or even in a caste system. Sometimes you start out with the best intention, but somewhere along the road you're just broken down.It was fascinating to read the two chapters from the book. The ideas that Orwell casted were just so awe-inspiring. I went back and reread the two chapters! I'm not implying that I agree with what he said in the book, but I appreciate this complex thoughts and ideas.It's one heck of a book!"
2248,CarrieLynn D.,"I read 1984 for the first time in high school, in the mid-1990s. At the time I do not think I understood how much it was commenting on the world around me. And perhaps it was not, as much as it is now. Because it definitely is now. It is not hard to hear about the NSA programs and not think about the telescreens and the Thought Police -- it was why I wanted to read the book again. But it goes beyond that. The idea of controlling people's education and inequality to make them stupid and afraid, so that you can control not only their present and future, but their pasts as well. The idea of the collective bandwagon being more truthful on reality than the objective nature of reality. The use of continuous war to justify and propagate inequality and power concentrated in the hands of the high class. All these things are happening around us, only not to the systematic extent accomplished by the Party in the book. Orwell meant this to be a warning decades ago, but it is still a warning now. Think for yourself, and don't get fooled again."
2249,Sara Mehrez,"1984 واحده من أهم 100 روايه كُتبت حتي الآن تدور احدث الروايه في مدينة لندن حيث يعمل ونستون صحفياً في وزاره الحقيقة وتتمثل وظيفته في تحوير جميع الاخبار والتاريخ الماضي الي ما يتوافق مع مباديء الحزب الذي يحكمه الأخ الكبير تنشأ علاقة عاطفيه بين ونستون وجوليا التي تعمل ايضاُ في الحزب , ومثل هذه العلاقات محرمة تماماً وتخالف مباديء الحزب الذي يسعي إلي تجريد جميع المشاعر الانسانيه والقضاء علي اي نوع من الحب خلاف الحب تجاه الحزب والأخ الكبير يُقبض عليهما في النهاية بتهمه "" جريمه الفكر "" من خلال خداع اوبراين لهم ويقابلا أسوأ أنواع العذاب الجسدي يتحولا في النهاية إلي أشخاص محطمين نفسياً , يطلق سراحهما وتننصر اوقبانيا في حروبها وتتم السيطره علي فكر ومشاعر ونستون بحب الأخ الكبير "

2251,Sujan,"The dystopian future where for the first time in human history, power has become absolute, is narrated by Orwell so horridly yet realistically that you become seriously doubtful if the destiny of our race would not be such. There seems no shortage of reason behind a complete totalitarian society, as throughout the whole history, humans have longed more than anything only one precious thing, POWER. The modern states also strive for this invaluable desire. One might wonder why that should be termed wrong, in stead of maintain partial power, to gain supreme power over everything, even over the thoughts of people! This is that sort of literature which fills your mind with utter pessimism about the future of human race, not giving any hint of hope. Hope may lie somewhere (this type of positivism has become quite a convention to end any pessimistic writing), but the essential human instinct which is corrupt with dark desires leaves us almost nothing to hope for."
2252,Nicholas Saunders,"1.The author came about to emphasize the themes of trust, loyalty to oneself, and of others. Orwell overall tried to point out that something you are told to be right may not be the case. People can be fooled to another bidding as in the novel,Big Brother over sees all.2.The events in this book reveals the authors intentions of how the world isn't as it seems. One has to find out for themselves, or to be fooled by it. Even in today's world, our government does what it can to do for its people. But do we really know if we are free to do what we want? Not all done can do good, but for whom it is directed to.3.This books per-say didn't make me uncomfortable at parts, but it made me realize with enough effort, anything can be accomplished even when things seem dire. This makes me want to try harder at the things at which I struggle most.4. I would highly recommend this book. It opens your mind in more than one way. I can't put it down. Every time I read I; I learn something more about the world and myself."

Jika itu dijamin, semua yang lain mengikuti.” (hal.110)diawali dengan ekspektasi tinggi karena tahu bahwa buku ini termasuk kedalam buku terbaik sepanjang masa, bagi saya sendiri buku ini adalah buku masa depan, memang buku ini lahir pada tahun 1949, meskipun begitu tidak peduli kalau ceritanya meramalkan ""masa depan"" tahun 1984 yang udah terlewat, pun juga saya belum lahir, tapi cerita yang tergambar adalah tetap merupakan gambaran masa depan. sebuah contoh sekaligus kritik terhadap negara totaliter. yang mungkin sengaja disampaikan oleh George Orwell sebagai peringatan agar situasi di negara totaliter seperti yang digambarkan dalam bukunya ini tidak sampai terjadi di dunia nyata.ya. semoga aja apa yang digambarkan di buku ini tidak kejadian. karena siapa juga yang ingin hidup di negara totaliter seperti Oceania, apa-apa di awasi negara. ngeri rasanya menjadi seorang Winston Smith meskipun punya pacar cantik tapi bahkan mau ketemuan aja harus dibayang-bayangi rasa takut diciduk oleh negara. hidup serba di atur. semua perbuatan. perkataan. ekspresi wajah. diawasi ketat 24 jam oleh negara melalui teleskrin. suram.suramnya negara totaliter seperti yang digambarkan dalam buku ini meskipun fiksi, tapi terasa nyata. terasa nyata karena George Orwell begitu pintar dalam menggambarkan keadaan distopis sebuah negara lengkap dengan aturan-aturan serta norma sosialnya.pokoknya tidak ada ruginya membaca buku ini. kisah yang sangat dalam dan kompleks. kualitas terjemahannya pun sangat baik. penggunaan gaya bahasanya diatur sedemikian rupa mirip seperti gaya bahasa pada sastra klasik Indonesia. jadi tidak terasa seperti membaca buku terjemahan. ada banyak sekali kalimat-kalimat yang ""quotable"". salah satunya seperti yang diatas. jadi ingin dibuat ""quote selfie"" lalu upload di instagram.""war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength""and watchout BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU."

This book makes you THINK. (And doublethink too!)I've rarely been so gripped by a book. The ending especially. No spoilers, but shit gets real. The scary thing is how disillusioned everyone in this book is. How could anyone possibly believe that a society founded on hate is better than a society founded on love?The Orwellian writing is superb. At times, I felt like I was being brainwashed along side Winston and everyone else in the novel. I seriously couldn't put it down, which truth be told, is something that happens more with my iphone than with books. But I loved this book. For anyone who is considering reading this book: do. "
2260,Aiden,"This is probably one of my favorite books of all time. The emotion and realism that Orwell captures in his book is amazing, and this book really made me view life differently. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone. The ending was really the scariest part. Not because of what happened. but because of what did not happen. I only realized this weeks after I read it. Such an amazing book."
2261,Juliana,"The tone of this book is as depressing as its subject matter, appropriately. It is a dystopian future in which hypocrisy and government control are absolute. The media is a blatant and all-pervasive mind control mechanism. The book outlines the chilling details of one dissentor's struggle to resist the omnipresent, omnipotent and mysteriously impersonal Big Brother. This is a dystopic classic and is still relevant today."
2262,Alexandra Blackburn,"1984 es la madre de las distopías y de la ciencia ficción. Para muchos, el libro de referencia de un género muy de moda en la actualidad, sobre todo entre los jóvenes. La lectura de 1984 ha sido apasionante, absorbente y, además, muy didáctica, de una forma verdaderamente gratificante. El mundo que propone George Orwell está ideado, planificado y detallado a la perfección. Es sorprendente su capacidad premonitoria, ya que resulta imposible no encontrar muchos de los aspectos de la trama en nuestro propio mundo e incluso en nuestro país. Aunque está escrito en 1949, no podría ser más actual. No penséis en un clásico como algo aburrido o latoso para leer, 1984 es adictivo y, cuando lo terminéis, os hará reflexionar sobre muchos temas.- Puedes leer la reseña completa aquí: http://dondestamilapiz.blogspot.com.e..."
2263,Taehoon Jun,"“Orthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.” This is Orwell's masterpiece that transcends its warnings of totalitarianism. Orwell's uncanny prediction of totalitarianism has stood the test of time as apparent in North Korea today, while reminding us to think for ourselves.""But after reading it he knew he was not mad. Being in a minority, even a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad… He fell asleep murmuring, “Sanity is not statistical” with the feeling that this remark contained in it a profound wisdom.""This is Orwell's plea to strive for objective reality even when drowning alone in an ocean of misinformation, willful ignorance and submission. This imperative was what nearly compelled Orwell to name this novel, ""The Last man in Europe."" Orwell has stated his fear of those who manipulate history which grew when he, as a soldier in the Spanish Civil War, witnessed incredible newspaper fabrications of battles that did not occur. He warns us of the powers of rhetoric and its role in twisting truths into untruths and implores us to hold, above all, our ability to reason as the basis of objective reality.“In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four.” “Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull. ” Learn to think for yourself. Don't be influenced by popular opinions. Scrutinize every bias of yours and identify why you hold them. Totalitarianism is forced orthodoxy, a lobotomy of our critical faculties. The reason this novel will remain eternally relevant is because whether oppressed by totalitarianism or not, one is always in danger of losing one's ability to think. It is true that in most of today's democracies, a ""big brother"" is a technological extreme we've not yet reached (although we are trying our best), but the lure of ""big sister"" is unrelenting and prevalent in social media, subjugating our views and opinions, causing us to blindly follow the majority without adequate scrutiny. If we continue to conform in this way, we edge closer to Orwell's nightmare vision and fueled by today's technology, the nightmare will distend beyond even Orwell's rich imagination."
2264,Phine Hazelbag,"When I finished this book, I wanted to give it a place of honour on my bookshelf, but I also wanted to throw the book out of the car’s window: I couldn’t handle the end, it was so sad! The storyline itself was very good and interesting: it made me realize that not everyone in the world has the rights and facilities we have here in the Netherlands. You have to enjoy the little things that life brings. In the book, I loved a quote that describes that intention precisely: ‘(Winston) …. He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in the cool of the summer evening, a man and a woman with no clothes on, making love when they chose, talking of what they chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside.’ The writing was beautiful but sometimes very difficult. Some chapters of the book did I have to re-read to understand what was going on. There are some monologues in the book that were so long, I couldn’t concentrate me enough to read it completely. But that’s probably because the book is from 1948, and I would love to re-read this book in a few years when my English is better.I would recommend this book to people who can handle a tough story in old writing. I loved the book and I’ve learned so much."

(hide spoiler)]It was the worst conditions in a dystopia i've ever read.The world was reconstructed on the basis of Fear & Hatred.How the things turned out in the book like Freedom is Slavery, War is Peace & Ignorance is Strength...The concept of Doublethink was the most important part of the book & how the brainwashing they did to the entire population throwing them in the pits of illusions and even burning up their conscience.This book was also on the Existentialism & the Illusion of Destiny laying many psychological implications. I don't think this would be suitable for children & shouldn't be in academics although it is thought provoking.This was based on the fact that the ever struggling Highs now decides to retain their positions permanently by suppressing everyone else.I totally agree with the critics that 'THIS WAS MEANT TO BE A WARNING & NOT A GUIDE'. This is the most awesome thing I've read this year!"

2270,Dhery Utami,"Mind-blowing book I've ever read!Belum pernah saya membaca sebuah buku fiksi, yang membuat saya benar-benar berpikir lama bahkan setelah selesai membacanya. George Orwell atau Eric Arthur Blair merupakan penulis berkebangsaan Inggris yang juga pernah meraih Nobel Kesusastraan. Buku ini pertama kali diterbitkan pada tahun 1949. Buku ini berisi pemikiran-pemikiran atau semacam ramalan Orwell akan kondisi Inggris kurang-lebih empat puluh tahun mendatang yaitu pada tahun 1984. Dalam buku ini, Inggris disebut dengan nama Oceania (terdiri atas kawasan-kawasan Amerika, pulau-pulau Atlantik yg meliputi Inggris, Australia & Afrika bagian selatan). Oceania digambarkan selalu berperang dengan Eurasia (terdiri atas seluruh bagian utara daratan Eropa & Asia) dan Eastasia (terdiri atas China & negeri2 di bagian selatannya, Jepang, sebagian Mancuria, Mongolia & Tibet). Ya, negara dalam 1984 hanya terbagi menjadi 3 bagian; Oceania, Eurasia & Eastasia. Winston Smith, tokoh utama di buku ini merupakan seorang anggota Partai Luar Oceania yang bekerja di “Ministry of Truth” (Departemen Kebenaran) di dalam Departemen Rekaman. Tugasnya adalah untuk membelokkan fakta, menghapus masa lalu dan menciptakan realitas baru. Winston mengubah isi pidato, pernyataan-pernyataan pemerintah, isi majalah atau surat kabar, serta arsip-arsip lain sesuai dengan instruksi Partai dan ""Bung Besar"". Tujuan utamanya agar rakyat tidak mengetahui bagaimana kehidupan mereka sebelum Revolusi, dan kehilangan petunjuk tentang mana yang benar dan mana yang salah, mana yang ilusi dan mana yang nyata. Di Oceania masyarakat dibagi menjadi 3 kelas, yaitu Partai Inti yg beranggotakan orang-orang pemerintahan yang langsung berhubungan dengan instruksi dari ""Bung Besar"", Partai Luar yg beranggotakan orang-orang biasa yang direkrut karena memiliki kualifikasi tertentu untuk melaksanakan tugas pemerintahan, dan Kaum Proletar yang merupakan rakyat jelata non partai yang dibiarkan hidup dengan pendidikan dan kesejahteraan minim.Setiap hari masyarakat Oceania selalu dijejali dengan doktrin-doktrin tentang keagungan Bung Besar dan kebencian terhadap Goldstein (pemimpin oposisi) serta musuh-musuh negara seperti masyarakat Eurasia atau Eastasia. Sungguh mengerikan rakyat dibiarkan hidup di bawah garis kemiskinan tanpa mereka tau kehidupan sebelum Revolusi itu seperti apa, karena setiap hari masa lalu diubah dan diperbarui sesuai kehendak Partai. Winston memiliki rasa ingin tau yg lebih besar daripada teman-temannya sesama anggota partai luar. Winston selalu berusaha mencari tahu seperti apa keadaan Oceania sebelum masa Revolusi, untuk itu dia sering melanggar aturan partai secara diam-diam. Mengapa secara diam-diam? karena setiap gerak-gerik anggota Partai Luar selalu diawasi oleh Telescreen dan Mikrofon tersembunyi. Telescreen ini seperti kamera cctv jaman sekarang, hanya bedanya alat ini bisa mendeteksi gesture2 mencurigakan dari objek yang diawasinya, meneriakinya dan melaporkannya kepada ""Polisi Pikiran"". Tidak ada kebebasan bersuara/berpendapat di Oceania, bahkan setiap pikiran diawasi oleh Polisi Pikiran. Jika ada indikasi atas sikap yang menyimpang atau tanda-tanda perlawanan, maka bersiaplah untuk ""diuapkan"". Ya, diuapkan berarti dihilangkan, nama mu akan dihapus dari sejarah. Penculikan, Penyiksaan, Pembunuhan menjadi hukuman pasti yang akan didapat jika melanggar aturan partai.Di Oceania para penjahat pikiran diharuskan mengakui segala kesalahan yang dituduhkan kepadanya bahkan yang tidak mereka lakukan sekalipun. Mereka harus mengakui realitas buatan partai tanpa boleh memiliki realitasnya sendiri, bahkan jika partai mengharuskan mereka mengakui 2+2=5 maka realitas itulah yang harus diterima. Pemutusan hubungan antara orangtua dan anak, suami dan istri, serta antar teman. Tidak ada teman sejati, karena mereka bisa saja melaporkanmu kepada Polisi Pikiran. Pemasungan kebebasan berpendapat ditandai dengan penciptaan Bahasa Baru atau ""Newspeak"". Bahasa dan kata-kata lama (oldspeak) disusutkan, dihapus sehingga tidak ada lagi kata-kata yang dipakai untuk mengacu pada sikap perlawanan atau pemberontakan kepada partai.Buku ini membuat saya bergidik ngeri, tidak terbayangkan jika saya harus hidup dalam dunia yang diciptakan oleh Orwell dalam bukunya. Penculikan, Penyiksaan, Penghilangan bukankah itu familier dengan sejarah negara kita, Indonesia di masa lalu? "

2272,Kiah,"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING. One of the best novels ever written, I believe. Terrifying, bleak and thorough trip into a totalitarian society. There's a reason ""Big Brother"" will forever be in our lexicon. ""Who controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present, controls the past."" Enough said. "
2273,Igor Tsinman,"Роман-антиутопия ""1984"" Оруэлла продолжает роман-пророчество ""Железная пята"" Джека Лондона. ""1984"" могут отлично дополнить постапокалиптический роман Дмитрия Глуховского ""Метро 2033"" и роман-панорама будущего Маргарет Этвуд ""Рассказ Служанки""."
2274,Martin,"I'm sad to say I have read through this, yet I do not want that to be taken negatively as the sadness is purely from the fact that the book in fact had an end. I tried as hard as I could to stretch it out over a long period of time, limiting myself to only reading a couple chapters a day but I still found myself cheating - ""Just one more page I swear!""This is a book I have been wanting to read for a while now and I am not actually sure why I never got around to it. My dad however must have remembered me mentioning it and bought me this lovely edition as ""stocking filler"" for Christmas. How such an amazing present could be referred to as stocking filler is beyond me. Right from the start you can see the parallels with how society is now and, while we may not have slipped as far (yet), you can easily see how the government would keep watch to such a scary extent if given the chance. I found myself sharing in the, not misery, but grudging acceptance of Oceania and for once while reading a book I had little hope for a happy ending and felt it wrong to hope for such a thing. I definitely recommend this book to everyone. It makes you think. It scares you. It draws you in to a world that doesn't actually seem to far away. 1984 is a book which will stay relevant throughout all of history. It lived up to and beyond my expectations of it and I feel the urge to re-read through it already. I know it was the first book I read of the new year but already I can see it being the best book I read of 2012 as another book would have to offer up a lot to beat it.I am most certainly in a dystopian mood now though and will have to try and find some good ones to read.On a completely unrelated note; every mention of the name ""Oceania"" makes me long that little bit more for Smashing Pumpkin's up and coming album. Here's to hoping it also lives up to my hopes. "
2275,Eleonora Romani,"Meraviglioso! Un libro GENIALE! Posso tranquillamente inserirlo tra i cinque libri più belli letti nella mia vita!Consiglio a tutti di leggerlo, riesce ad aprire la mente, proprio perché parla di un mondo ""chiuso"", ed inevitabilmente fa riflettere. E' scritto in modo scorrevole, in certi tratti mi ricorda moltissimo la DDR, nella Berlino Est, mi tornano in mente libri relativi, appunto, alla storia del muro di Berlino, avvenimento che fu successivo alla scrittura di questo libro (1961-1989),(che la DDR abbia preso spunto da lui?).Credo che ORWELL abbia scritto una grande opera, all'epoca era ""reduce"" dalla seconda guerra mondiale, e quindi ha avuto sicuramente spunti da ciò che è accaduto negli anni che hanno preceduto e in tutta la durata della guerra stessa, ma è stato veramente geniale. Questo libro riesco a trovarlo attuale, spesso cercano di ""metterci"" in testa cose assurde, che alla fine diamo per vere proprio perché più persone pensano di vedere questo fatto/avvenimento, o credendo in qualcosa in più persone, ""automaticamente"" può diventare vero, è proprio la nostra mente che lo da per tale.Non ho trovato nulla di scontato, molti avvenimenti non li avevo immaginati, non avrei mai pensato che certe cose accadessero il ""quel"" modo o ""nell'altro"", è riuscito sempre a sorprendermi. Spesso capita che quando si legge un libro, si percepisce cosa accade dopo.. per 1984, non è assolutamente così! Avevo optato per due finali e alla fine, un terzo mi ha completamente spiazzato, non lo avevo minimamente immaginato!ORWELL con questo libro è entrato totalmente nel mio cuore, ed è riuscito ad aprirmi gli occhi!"

2280,Igor Corovai,"Если проецировать современную реальность на реальность, описанную в произведениях, можно сказать, что авторы утрируют.Взять, к примеру, ""451 градус по фаренгейту"": книги-зло, стено-телевизор в четыре стены комнаты, ракушка в ухо, пустые речи. Казалось бы - это слишком. До этого ещё далеко. Но мы уже живём в этом. Не встречались ли вам люди, которые говорят только ради того, чтобы говорить не заботясь о том какую информацию они передают и какой смысл они вкладывают в свою речь? Или взгляните на окружающих людей: сколько часов они проводят за телевизором или за компьютеров сёрфя паблики? Попробуйте пронаблюдать за выражением лица человека, когда он смотрит телевизор. Особенно за едой.Что я хочу сказать? Как бы ни казалась картинка, описанная в произведении нереальной и далёкой от действительности - снизить степень утрированности - и вот она - современная реальность. В которой мы живём.1984. Джордж Оруэлл.Меня разделяют чувства после прочтения этой книги. С одной стороны показаны ужасы тоталитарного общества, а с другой стороны - я нахожу тоталитаризм эффективным политическим режимом. А измеримость эффективности уже зависит от целей.Можно провести параллели между произведением ""1984"" и СССР или Третьем Рейхом.Меня на самом деле восхитило то, как воспитываются люди в таком государстве, как используются техники изменения сознания. Технология переписи истории - великолепно. Должен сказать, что мне очень нравится модель АнгСоца. Она разбирается на элементы, которые можно использовать по-отдельности.Книга оставила смешанные чувства и неразрешённые вопросы. В будущем я её обязательно перечитаю."
2281,Cinthia,"Wow, Honestly I loved this book more towards the end... At the beginning it felt like it dragged with all the descriptions and all the background stories from Winston... I think at some point I even got confused between the Party, the thought policy and the brotherhood... After about 60% this book seriously hooked me up, Julia and Winston made a really cute couple, although after Julia and Winston get caught they are out to just self themselves and give up the other one easily.. Julia gets tortured although the book does not really explain what happens to her but when Winston sees her after his own torturing then we can deduce that she WAS tortured, her body and spark is not the same, it seems to Winston her will of life has been sucked out of her... Winston on the other hand gets tortured by O'brien, and is given a set of confusing answers, is the Brotherhood real? 'you will never know"" the Bother hood is watching.. ok...? In end we don't really know if Winston is dead or not, although I believe he is shot in the brain and the two brandy tears rolling down his nose is blood... I don't really know, I left me quite intrigued... "
2282,Nooshin,just like what going on here!
2283,Shane,"In Orwell’s 1984 we find Winston struggling with his place in the world he lives in. Watched 24/7 by Big Brother, and working a mundane job changing the past to keep the government correct, he can only find solace writing in a notebook in a small corner away from the telescreen. He scribbles his disgust with his world, and begins to hope that the man he sees in the Two Minute Hate every day is real, and that he can somehow join him. You know, not very good thoughts to have about the government that dictates your laws and can punish you severely, especially a government with the amount of power as Big Brother. I will not go too much further into the plot because I like to avoid spoilers. I love the novel, and I give it a 5 star rating. It builds upon the dystopia that was growing within Animal Farm, minus the animals of course, and takes it to its extreme ending, complete and utter control. This novel shows a bland, dangerous world, so when the plot twists hit, it becomes an insane read. The ending is depressing, but I will not say why here. Amazing book that is good for anyone who enjoys dystopian fiction. "

2286,Miriam,"I just don't even have words for this book, I think I am still in shock from the ending. This book started out boring but then varied from interesting to lovey dovey to boring again and then the ending was an explosion of intensity! I REALLY liked this book because of the ending (which is most likely everbody's favorite part). The ending really got me thinking and made me frustrated but it was also realistic which I like. I also enjoyed all of the characters personalities because they were so interesting(yes, even the antagonists). This book is a suprisingly good read and I think everybody should read it once in their life."
2287,Vale,"1984 è considerato a ragione un capolavoro. La lettura di questo romanzo post-moderno, in quanto ambientato in un'epoca futura rispetto allo scrivente, offre delle importanti riflessioni al lettore poiché Orwell immagina un mondo in cui il Big Brother, incarnazione del potere assoluto e quindi deumanizzato, controlla le vite di ciascuno. L'obiettivo primario, però, non è solo il controllo, ma la manipolazione delle vite e questa si può ottenere solo agendo in alcuni ambiti: 1. il linguaggio, ossia privando gli uomini dell'uso di un lessico variegato, 2. l'amore, poiché non essere liberi di amare, rende schiavi di una vita anodina3. il bipensiero, ovvero la negazione degli eventi passati e quindi di un principio di non contraddizione: in qualsiasi momento si può far finta che il Partito abbia commesso un'azione sbagliata, negando che sia mai avvenuta!4. la povertà, perché se ci si disabitua alla bellezza non si avrà motivo per vivere con intensità e quindi per volere qualcosa di più.5. la guerra, poiché utile mezzo per fomentare odio e incanalare le frustrazioni.E' triste pensare che il mondo di Orwell non sia poi, così dissimile dal nostro..."
2288,Shanu,"I didn't know what to expect when i started this book and didn't think much while reading it... until Winston and Julia were arrested. Then it became clear that we had lost to big brother and it was a race against the clock to save ourselves from whatever was coming. First part was world building, second part was centered around julia (i thought that Winston and Julia would end up married) and i expected (oh so wrongly) that the last part would be about rebellion. As i saw that the last part was quite short i thought that maybe it would only put the presages of a change and the hope that would came along. But no. The object of the end of the book was the end of humanity. And it was painful to read. O'brien was... terrifying but impressive at the same time. Do read it. "
2289,Dóra Károly,"One of George Orwell’s most famous novels 'Nineteen Eighty-Four', sometimes published as '1984' was written in 1948, and published in 1949 by 'Secker and Warburg'. The original title of the novel was 'The Last Man in Europe', which refers to the main character Winston Smith. The novel was written in an age when dictatorship and totalitarianism were present, for example, in the Soviet Union. So in my opinion it may not be unintentional that similarities can be drawn between the political system of Airstrip One, a province of Oceania in '1984' and the politics of the Soviet Union. The ""world"" being built up in this novel with the English Socialism or Ingsoc, as it is named in the language, Newspeak, invented by the government, is anti-utopian. It means that it intends to look utopian, but it is flawed. It looks like that everything is provided for the citizens, but in fact they are misled. Think about, for example, the history books being constantly rewritten. Besides, the government’s main motive is not to care of the good of others, but it is solely about having as much power as they could possibly get. Naturally, this includes the power and control over others, as well. This is what Big Brother is for. But what happens when there is one man, whose thoughts and feelings are not ""switched off""? The answer is that this totalitarian system interprets this ""incidence"" as a need for cure, which could rather be called mind-control or brainwashing, because the result is beneficial only for the political order and not for the ""patient"". It is again not about what is good for the citizen, but what is best for the system. "
2290,Megan Mcmillan,"I wasn't expecting this book to be as scary as it turned out to be. It started out as dark and gloomy like a lot of other Dystopian but as I got towards the end the physical reactions this book gave me were more powerful than possibly any other book I've ever read. I am talking specifically about room 101 and the horrors that lay within. I wanted to cry out of sheer despair for Winston. My stomach churned constantly throughout the very last part of the book. Overall, this was a very powerful read and the message that it portrays was done beautifully through Orwell's stunning writing. However, I read this as someone who is particularly ignorant about politics and whilst I found the sections that were essentially info dumping quite helpful some people who are like me and do not know about politics will find this frustrating as it is a lot to take in in some places. "
2291,Ellen F. Castro,"""Não era fazendo-de ouvir, mas mantendo a sanidade mental que a pessoa transmitia sua herança humana."" Eu resumiria a moral do livro nessa frase. "
2292,Madeline Anderson," This book is about so much more than analyzing the projected future of a Stalinesque communism. The insights into language (your vocabulary can limit or free you) and the expanse of a military state are still appropriate. Love Orwells ability to take an idea and expand on it to show the consequences of unchecked power. Ultimately this book is such a great read in the era of ongoing wars, government supervised social media etc. His challenge to the push and pull of the limits of security vs. freedom is astute. I feel like once you read this book you'll start finding similarities in the modern world and that makes it a must read. "
2293,Lori Vaughn,My favorite book of all time.

2295,Pratik Shinde,"""Under the spreading chestnut treeI sold you and you sold meThere lie they, and here lie weUnder the spreading chestnut tree""I finished reading ""1984 by George Orwell"" two days before. Since then this verse has haunted my sleep, giving me my worst nightmares..Until today if asked ""Why do you care about history? Or existential reasoning ?"".... I probably wouldn't have answered. After reading 1984 I have a definite answer, ""Go and read 1984.""People's indifference to the tampered history and Winston's pathetic attempt to figure out how the world was before tyrannic government and O'Brien's statement ""the Party, control all records, and we control all memories. Then we control the past, do we not?"" astoundingly portrays what happens when we stop struggling with these questions and allow a small group of people in power to make all of the judgment calls."
2296,Roos,Incredibly depressing. Also incredibly profound.
2297,Nicole Wyatt,"Wooooow. This book was almost prophetic! I read it first in high school because I had to, and then I read it a second time as an adult. It was as an adult that I actually enjoyed it. I didn't understand the significance of it as a teen. Truly, what Orwell envisioned for 1984 is more in line with 2014. Simply wild. I enjoyed it immensely, and will likely read it again and again."
2298,Mikaela Sachi,"The 1984 concept I find is connected vaguely with some of the dystopian literature of today. Take the Hunger Games, for example. The concept of rations and the song about the Hanging Tree is similar to the Chestnut Tree song and food rations in 1984, only the songs have different metaphors, more or less. The most frightening thing about this book is how incredibly real the author makes the concept with three slogans alone: War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength. The way George Orwell created the possibility of such a concept is so believable that you end up fearing that this might happen to us in real life. I am only comforted with the idea that as long as the world keeps its humanity, this could never happen. Please, good God, let us keep our humanity. I feel that is the moral of this story: if we lose our humanity, this is what will happen. If we make our thirst for power too great, this is what will happen. The reeling emotion I feel with this book compels me to give it five stars. Doubleplusgood. "
2299,Mohamad Rezaei,Best of them all. I haven't read any book that finishes this good. Its like I was in it.

2302,Ahmed Mohsen,"War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength"
2303,Jensbookshelf,"Nineteen Eighty-Four is a brilliant book. It’s not just the ultimate dystopian classic. It’s a cultural phenomenon. It gave us Big Brother, the Thought Police and, of course, the adjective Orwellian. I’ve never read anything that can rival Nineteen Eighty-Four for its sheer sense of decay and oppression. There’s not a single page that doesn’t provide a chill of some sort, and that doesn’t hold up a mirror to modern society.Nineteen Eighty-Four’s relevance hasn’t diminished over time, despite the parallels to twentieth century political figures that might otherwise date it. Sure, Emmanuel Goldstein might be Leon Trotsky, and Big Brother might look like just like Stalin, but you don’t have to know that. You only have to realise that Goldstein may no better than Big Brother, and, most importantly, that Goldstein might not even exist at all. History is written by the victors. It is tweaked, changed, whole parts of it are purged, and Winston Smith knows it, but the truth has been so well hidden that nobody will ever discover it. Not Winston, and not even the reader.I love Nineteen Eighty-Four. It’s a book with a message, but it doesn’t preach. Orwell really had a handle on that old advice for writers: Show, don’t tell. If you don’t come away from reading Nineteen Eighty-Four with a healthy distrust of the government and the media, you’re doing it wrong."
2304,Jillian Motyl,Just re-read this book again after not reading it since high-school and I loved it even more. Amazing writing.
2305,Nina Rapsodia,"¿Quien no ha oído hablar de esta novela en algún punto? es de las novelas más conocidas del género distópico y una de las más relevantes. Me es muy difícil explicarme con un libro tan bueno como este. Ya ha pasado más de una semana desde que lo terminé y creo que la sensación que me dejó con su final ha ido mejorando con el correr del tiempo.Winston Smith es un trabajador gris de treinta y siete años (al menos esa es la edad que cree tener), que trabaja en el Londres perteneciente a la basta zona de Oceania. Trabaja en el Ministerio de la verdad, en la que su empleo consiste en alterar lo que dicen los periódicos antiguos según las decisiones del Partido para adecuarlo a sus necesidades. Con una ulcera en el tobillo que le pica constantemente y una telepantalla que le reproduce noticias pero que además le espía, Winston vive una vida en la que hasta pensar de forma contraria al pensamiento del Partido es mortal. Esta organización en la figura de su líder el Gran Hermano, lidera constantes guerras con Eurasia y Estasia para así 'cuidar' a sus ciudadanos. Fomenta el odio hacia el gran opositor y y destructor de la sociedad, Emmanuel Goldstein y promueve la devoción total al Gran Hermano y a la supresión de sentimientos como la amistad, el amor y claro, la libertad de opinión.Winston como tal, es un simple peón. Pero con el tiempo ha aprendido a disimular sus recuerdos, sus pensamientos y su rico mundo interior. Es decir, ha practicado el doublethink, la habilidad de tener dos pensamientos contradictorios al mismo tiempo y estar consciente de ello. En su interior, Winston odia el régimen y al Gran Hermano, pero al mismo tiempo debe quererle. Winston en su interior es un opositor del gobierno, y no tardará en buscar a otros que lo sean.

2307,Katerina,"A difficult book, but so strong! Maybe 1984 is gone and things were different, but let's pretend the title is 2084 or 2184! The suppression of free thinking, the manipulation of the past and the future. An endless situation without hope. Just so dystopian and just so impressive."
2308,Shubhankar Tiwari,"A palatable Matrix!War is Peace, Freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength and the way the George Orwell convinces us to such a blatant belief that 2+2 = 5, is in itself a literary feat. Newsspeak and Doublethink sends shivers down the spine when one thinks how and why of power explained in the ""Book"" have been implemented.He has analysed the very fiber of society, how is one supposed to revolt when one doesn't know if he is being oppressed. When the history is being rewritten continuously and to make one's most fundamental beliefs change and also accept them as truth. ""Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past."""
2309,Mohammed Al Kharboush,One of the best political/philosophical novels I've ever read in my entire life!
2310,Marwan Asmar,"A book to remember, not only because of the beauty of its language but because of the sinister story it tells, its current, real and futuristic. Its constantly ringing alarm bells that speak of hoplessness and degeneration. Winston Smith facing big brother, a huge overbearing, dogmatic, security-conscious, thought-manipulating system that seeks to ""regidize"" life and streamline the mind to think in a tunneled approach while espousing a system of thought-control to keep the one party and one ideology going for the sake of political power. 1984 is about big brother watching you through television and camera screen found everyewhere in the workplace, public places, in the home, even the toilet. It says a lot about our world, although the book was published in the late 1940s. Its a book of sad unmitigated horror about altering relations between your spouses, sons and daughters socialized to spy on you, girlfriends and friends, a society where emotions are sapped, and sex demeaning for the sake of serving big brother who looks after and nurtures you. The picture is real, dumbfounded, menotonous and exacting, depicating a future society of drudgery, skullduggery and absolutism. The horrors continue in the depiction where power is there for its own ends made certain through through continually changing your system of information so whatever ""news"" you have is constantly being altered, re-altered, changed and manipulated to suit different times, and for shameless political expediency."
2311,Peter,"I first read this book about 20-30 years ago and was really moved by it back then,not sure that anyone can truly say that they enjoyed this book as it makes uncomfortable reading or at least it should. Anyway now that I'm a lot greyer,I hesitate to say wiser, I decided to revisit it in particular in light of news stories in Britain about phone-tapping and the Edward Snowden, GCHQ spying revelations to name but two.I won't go into detail about the story and will only say that the main character Winston Smith is in the minority of 15% of the population that works for the Party, Big Brother, which controls Oceania. He lives in a very grey London where shortages of all sorts abound and a city in constant threat of attack.However, he begins to doubt the validity of his work and the tenets of the Party in particular when he falls in love with a work colleague Julia. In their own way they decide to revolt against Big Brother with calamitous consequences. I really enjoyed the character development and despite the greyness of life within London Orwell manages to bring it to life with vivid brilliance. The ending when it comes comes with a bit of rush and it is not a happy one.Despite being written many years ago what is most disturbing about this book is that it is so easy to see parallels with life, particularly in the West, today. We have Government ministers that want to introduce bio-metric identity cards, CCTV cameras sprouting up everywhere, supermarket storecards that monitor exactly what you are buying, seemingly more and more losses of civil liberties in the supposed unending fight against terrorism with more and more power taken from the people and given to even smaller cliques despite talk by Politicians of ""localism"". It could even be said that the present wars in places like Syria, South Sudan and Central African Republic are in many ways like the ""wars"" staged in this book, they are not about winning National territory or gaining natural resources but instead imposing one own beliefs onto others and there just seems to be a certain inevitability about it all just as in this book which should be truly frightening.This is a very good read and one in which the ideas it espouses should live with the reader for a very long time and as such should be considered as compulsory reading in all Further Education establishments."
2312,Heidi Thomas,A timeless message. We should all re-read it.
2313,LireauxWC,"Ce que j’ai aimé : Winston, ce pauvre Winston. Ce qui le rend tellement attachant, c’est que ce n’est pas un héros, c’est toi et moi, juste un pauvre type, qui n’est pas tellement attirant, et qui commence tout juste à se poser des questions, aimerait améliorer un peu le quotidien, juste kiffer sa vie. Sa compagne Julia, avec qui il entretient des rapports un peu ambigus. Elle c’est une filoute, la grande révolution, toussa, ça ne l’intéresse pas : son délire c’est niquer le système pour carpe diem. Winston entretient avec elle des rapports ambigus, la déteste et l’aime à la fois, mais elle devient quand même une bouffée d’air frais dans ce monde de brutes.Oui, ce n’est pas une image, c’est vraiment un monde de brutes. T’as intérêt à filer droit mon Coco, même quand tu fais ta gym le matin, gare à la vilaine qui te gueule dessus derrière le télécran. Orwell nous a conçu un fuckin’ cauchemar de life : déjà, ta vie c’est de la merde, dans un monde de merde, où tu bouffes même pas à ta faim, seul compte la collectivité et le moindre pet de travers te conduit en chambre de torture. Ton mantra dans ta vie de chiotte, c’est de tout faire pour Big Brother, ton leader charismatique. Plus rien ne compte d’autre. Pour que tu y arrives bien, on te lave le cerveau à chaque minute de ta vie, réécriture de l’histoire, mais aussi du présent, simplification à l’extrême de la langue pour te rétrécir la pensée comme une bite à poil en plein hiver. La Novlangue, nom d’une pipe, la Novlangue…Alors au départ, t’enquilles le livre, à la fraîche, détendu du gland, tu n’y vois qu’une critique de l’U.R.S.S. (surtout si comme moi, tu viens d’une fin de siècle). Et c’est ce que j’y avais vu dans mes yeux de lycéenne. Entre temps, le monde a bien changé, moi aussi. C’est là que le bouquin prend toute son ampleur et te met toi, petit lecteur, dans un bon gros malaise de sous les fagots. Ca fait des années qu’on t’agite le cerveau avec Big Brother, grâce à Grand Gogole, t’as plus de vie toussa. Oui, bon, effectivement. Mais quand tu colles au bouzin l’actualité politique de ces trente dernières années, au fait qu’il faut toujours un Grand Satan, avant l’U.R.S.S., maintenant le Djihad, la croissance constante des pouvoirs de l’Etat, les castes, le maintien constant dans la peur, tellement en Vigipirate dont ils ont abusé de tout le nuancier du rouge. Pourquoi? Tu fermes le bouquin, tu pleures un bon coup, et tu dis non à la Propagande. Tu ne regarderas plus jamais un documentaire, ni sur TFM6, ni sur Arte, ni sur le Web, chacun essayant juste de coller dans le cerveau sa propre vision.Pardon, je m’égare, mais ce livre à réouvert quelque chose en moi, une étincelle : non, je ne vais pas m’engager dans une quelconque cause, je veux juste rester libre et qu’on arrête de me ronger le cerveau. Merci Orwell, quel putain de visionnaire : tu fais mal, mais c’est pour mon bien.Ce que je n’ai pas aimé : Devenir encore plus lucide…http://wc.pressepuree.fr/1984-george-..."
2314,Bryanna Williams,"It was really good, though a hard read due to how much thought has to be put in to be able to understand and relate!"
2315,Kender Myers,"1984 is a fictional book that was written by George Orwell in 1948. The book depicts Orwell's horrifying prophecy of what he believes the future will succumb to. Like The Hunger Games, 1984 presents an ugly forthcoming after their forms of government began to become power hungry. Orwell continuously restates Oceania's(the setting of the novel), motto ""WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH."" Orwell stresses this statement so that the reader can truly understand the ever so contradicting world of Oceania. In this world opposing statements somehow keep the people believing every word they say, no matter how little truth it really holds. Like Katniss, the main character, Winston Smith, is torn between being safe and surrendering to the government or putting himself in immense danger so that he can possess the power of thought and freedom. Throughout the book this proves to be an internal battle for Winston. With so much at stake, Orwell is sure to keep the reader on their toes wondering which direction Winston will run. This dystopian novel is a must read for all. I awarded 1984 with five stars because of the way that Orwell was able to peer into the future and tell a both chilling and horrific view of what the future could very well capitulate to. Although he was imagining 1984 and that year has come and gone, reader's can still compare Orwell's unforgettable novel to what our world could look like in thirty years. For generations to come 1984 will always be a prevalent novel because of its easily relatable and unpredictable topic of the future. "
2316,Richard,"I don't know what to say about this book,except prehaps the obvious.If I say it was brilliant or a work of genius,I won't be saying anything that hasn't already been said by the readership populace or some superior authority,that is undeniably and indisputably true.The trouble is that this piece has become so deeply ingrained in the consciousness of Britain and even the world for it's cultural impact,literary brilliance and stark truthfulness,that it seems anything that I say might be superfluous and repetitious.So what can be said that is new about a truly great novel that seems above reviewing?Well,for a start,to a new audience who are familiar with a book prehaps because it's a cultural treasure or through the media,the charm and immediacy of the book,as much as it's raw and graphic description of probably the most terrifying totalitarian dystopia in literature,lies in the simple and compassionate depiction of it's all too human and familiar characters trapped in a Britain ruled by English Socialism or Ingsoc and the eponymous ""Big Brother"".The central players in this formidable drama,the rebels Winston and Julia,are as simple,engaging and ordinarily English as anything or anybody could imagine in Anglican lore.Their tribulations and courage in facing an enemy who they know too well from within,are described with a simple knowing grace and insight.Their relationship is described openly and without proper frills,not least with the theme of sex,an offence under ""Thought Crime"",which ""the party"" are trying too abolish,or anyway it's erotic element,leaving it only for the necessary marriage and children with no ""human participation"" by the female.This was very daring for the time the book was published,and it's surprising that George Orwell got away with it,so far as I know,when the novel was published,but also shows a maverick streak I think is pivotal to the novel's thought and greatness.Now that I think is a statement of original thinking!No such restrictions inhibit the old fashioned working class,""the proles"",who unlike the inner party workers,are allowed their pleasures in the old way,and are simple enough to admire the awful regime which doesn't seem to affect them though.It is these simple folk that Winston and Julia admire however,seeing in them a link to a better world dimly remembered,and their faith in the people who one day will over-through the government,even though it may take a millennium.There is an almost constant sentimental longing for things past and old English in ""Nineteen Eighty-four"",and this is seen through the lives of the proles and the eyes of Winston and Julia.The world of London's east end still intact in a much changed country,is vividly portrayed in the description of it's streets and pubs,and is part of an idealism I think,that can also be found in his other novel of anti starlinism,""Animal Farm"",that evokes feelings of freedom and a return to simple values.Both books draw their strength and authority from such clear sighted opinions.Hopefully,I've provided something new for criticism of an established masterpiece.It certainly is a book that deserves renewed examination."
2317,Vernelle Edwards,"Unfortunately, 1984 is still real today. Mr. Orwell's account of Big Brother, i.e the governement, conformity, denial of human rights characterizes many countries today. Yes I do recommend this book highly."
2318,Anshul Porwal,"Ever asked yourself why this society exists on notion of goodness and freedom? Why can not a society with exactly opposite values exist - An order based on oppression, and pure pursuit of power? Such is the power of 1984 (and Orwell, of course) that you would end up questioning these fundamental fabrics of society, and wonder why good is good and bad is bad. It's like looking into the basic structure of our moral values and discovering that everything is empty within. In a literal sense, Orwell is asking the same question Physicists have been asking for ages: In this universe, why is that matter is invariably preferred over anti-matter? What makes good preferable than bad? (Not that I am comparing ""bad"" with anti-matter, its just an analogy)Yes, this might sound crazy and you might think the questions asked here are stupid. But sit down, read the book uninterrupted for a whole day, and do nothing but read it. And don't just read it, let it flow deep into you. And you would find yourself transformed from the person who believed that ""Truth always triumphs"" to someone who can't distinguish truth from lie, in a single day! "
2319,Anoud,رواية مذهلة من جانب جورج أورويل ، حيث ينتقد بها الرأسمالية ، السيد اوريل كتب الكتاب كحقيقة آمن بحدوثها بحلول العام 1984 ، و فعلاً ، صدمت من قدر صحة الأحداث في الرواية و انطباقها على حياتنا اليومية ، حيث يوجد في الرواية حزب مسيطر و شرطة أفكار حيث يجعلونك تختفي من التاريخ و يمسحون اسمك من جميع السجلات حالما تبدأ بالتفكير أو يرونك تكتب في دفتر ما ، الكتاب لا يصدق ، إضافة ثريّة حقا لمكتبك * مشاهدة فيلم الكتاب قد يساعدك على فهمه بشكل أفضل *
2320,Ashlyn Kale,"The society presented by George Orwell in this novel is terrifyingly plausible. It really did a number on my anxiety, but in a very thought-provoking way. I can honestly say that reading 1984 caused me to seriously reconsider my priorities and make some major changes in my life. Beautifully written, my adrenaline was pumping the whole way through and the story haunts me to this day. (Side note to anyone wondering: I really wasn't a fan of Animal Farm. Both novels focused on the dangers of authoritarian government, but portrayed the ideas in completely different ways.)"
2321,Esraa Muhammed,جورج اوريل ابدع..روايه ملهاش حل ..نظره مستقبليه..نهايه غير متوقعهبراعه الكاتب ان توقع ما لم يراه احد
2322,Leo Levy,"In around 250 pages, Orwell unravels everything that philosophers like Hobbes championed. He creates a theoretical society that instead of being founded on providing for every man's wants is founded on denying the majority of men their needs, and yet functions perfectly. As in Animal Farm, he also orchestrates the book's allegorical content so intentionally that it is an enjoyable piece of entertainment. This book is powerful not only as a dire warning against autocracy, but also as a thoughtful philosophical text and an engaging novel. "
2323,Mike Atkinson,"A stunning portrayal of a potential future, written by a weakening man with a great, open mind.Perhaps my favourite book of all time, at least so far, 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' presents us with a world where fascism and totalitarianism reign supreme, where humanity is but one working mass, a machine, supporting the ideologies put into place by the Party, with Big Brother at the helm. Winston Smith - the protagonist - is a man who doubts the world in which he lives, and has done for some time. But that is Thoughtcrime. And Thoughtcrime is death - the Thought Police have ways of finding things out. But this cannot stop Winston - drained and depressed as he helps to pull the wool over the eyes of society, he decides to find out just what life was like before the revolution. But I won't spoil it for you.Perhaps the most striking aspect of this book is that it can indeed be seen as an exaggerated commentary on the ideals held by society today. Indeed, thankfully, we are not under a totalitarian regime, nor is open mindedness a crime, but we still move as one, we are expected to play our part, to conform, a slave to money and then we die. The connections that can be made between Orwell's fiction and our reality are somewhat disturbing.This is a remarkable piece of literature. Very highly recommended."
2324,Rebekah Rochester,"My friend once told me that she would never read The Fault in Our Stars again. ""I just don't want the things that happened in it to happen again,"" she explained. I thought I understood. I thought that when I read it, my soul would be shattered by the tragedy that is the intelligent Augustus's heart-breakingly unfair and incredibly well-known demise.But when I read The Fault in Our Stars, nothing of that sort occurred. Augustus's death was heart-breaking. And sad. And horrifically unfair, and poignant, etc, etc, but it wasn't THAT BAD. I thought I could very well sit through it again. And I did, immediately afterwards. I read the whole book again and thought that, yes, it was sad. But I could bear it a few more times.But I don't think I'll ever be able to read 1984 again.""I just don't want the things that happened in it to happen again.""I don't want to be there as the picture falls away from the wall to reveal the telescreen again.I don't want to watch helplessly as Mrs Parsons is dragged behind her shutting front door by her maniacal kids again.I don't want to flinch as the starving prisoner writhes on the floor and desperately betrays everything he once was in an attempt to avoid Room 101 again.I don't want to watch as the paperweight is mercilessly smashed on the floor again.I don't want to realise that there is no Brotherhood, and O'Brien was always a bad guy, and The Book was written by the Party again.And I don't want to watch as Winston is shattered into a million pieces again. Winston: clever, quiet, curios, desperate for proof in a world full of lies. I don't to be present in the final scene when the shells of Winston and Julia have nothing left to love each other with again.I don't want to read about the rats (THE HORRIBLE RATS), or the whitish speck of dust, or the lady with red arms who would sing all evening if she had an endless supply of clothes pegs.I don't want to be there when Mr Charrington walks into the room and Winston knows, he just knows, again.And I don't think I'll ever sing 'Oranges and Lemons' again.This book TERRIFIED me. It shook me to the core. It's not happy. There's no triumphant ending, no place inside Winston's head the Party couldn't reach. It's sad, and it's scary, and it's truthful and expresses myself better than I ever could. Winston is one of my favourite characters ever, and at times I thought that this book was a love story, but it's not, of course. It's a warning, and it's as relevant today as it was in 1948. If not more so.And I think that, even though it will shatter me again, I will have to read it again sometime. It's too important not to be read again, and again, and again."
2325,Cheryl,"I Wish that I read this sooner. The well-known references to Big Brother and Room 101 emanated from here.Oceania is a socialistic Dystopia engaged in ever-changing wars with Eastasia and Eurasia. Wars, we later discover, keep the people repressed and easy to govern. They are kept isolated from the other countries and dependable statistics in terms of economy, wealth and history and therefore have no form of comparison. They simply have no way of knowing how worse off they are and have to believe the propaganda dolled out to them which could change from day to day. They know that logically that it's not right and have to employ ""doublethink"".""Newspeak"" is the language of the Oceania and evolved from the Oldspeak. It's constantly evolving and slowing all adverbs, adjectives, words expressing or describing emotions and beliefs are being stripped away and replaced by one precise word so for example, we have ""good"", ""plusgood"" and ""doubleplusgood"" to describe something positive. It becomes and offence to use any other word once the approved one has been adopted.The story has modern as well as futuristic themes. The protagonist is Winston Smith who works in reality control and writes one day in his diary: ""If there is hope ... it lies in the proles"". As I write this anti-capitalist demonstrations are taking place in London protesting against the Big Capitalists.It has good dramatic tension as well as comedy: I loved the description of Winston's frustration at trying to question the old man in the pub as to whether his life is better now or 50 years ago.Would recommend to anyone interested in the themes mentioned above."
2326,Carrie Slager,"1984 is probably one of the toughest (if not the toughest) book to review. It has become a cultural phenomenon and is referred to in everything from movies, news and talk shows to everyday conversation. Before even reading the book, I knew the basic plot of the story, knew the terms doublethink, Big Brother, Room 101 and Thought Police. For someone who tries to not even read reviews (unless that’s how I discover a book) before reading a book, this makes reviewing 1984 nearly impossible. But I’ll try to talk about the book on its own merits, not on what it has become in our culture.Frankly, 1984 is a terrifying picture of a possible future in which everyone’s actions, even thoughts are under strict control. Enter Winston Smith, a man who remembers the first days of the Revolution and the Party’s rise to power. But he can’t talk about it because the Party now has complete power over everything, past, present and future. The past is malleable and can be changed in an instant, which is part of Winston’s job in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth. After being oppressed for so long, Winston is the kind of person you would expect. He’s terrified of being found out, yet rebels in small ways by writing in his diary and loving Julia.Yes, Winston is a hero in some respects, but he’s not your traditional hero or even your traditional anti-hero. He’s just a man struggling through life in an oppressive regime, knowing that there is no hope of change. He doesn’t join the rebels in actively fighting against the Party and Big Brother, he doesn’t become a high-ranking official of the Inner Party to sabotage their efforts, he doesn’t distribute pamphlets denouncing the government and he certainly doesn’t do any other traditional hero-in-a-dystopia things. Maybe I’ve been reading too much YA lately, but 1984, depressing as it is, is quite a nice change. It’s not a hopeful or uplifting story; it’s a warning.I wouldn’t exactly call 1984 fast-paced by modern standards, but it’s not like I fell asleep reading it either. There’s an atmosphere of doom that hangs over the whole novel and it sucks you in, forcing you to keep reading even though you know the ending. The best part of George Orwell’s book? You can interpret it how you like. You can interpret it as a warning against big government, a tirade against socialism (or, conversely, praise of socialism), a cautionary tale about what happens when people stop questioning their leaders, etc. It’s easy to see how the term ‘Orwellian’ worked its way into the vocabulary of not only our politicians, but the general populace.I give this book 5/5 stars. I mean, really, this is one of the few classics that should be studied in school."

2328,Sora Zee,"Worth the time, worth the effort, worth reading. Best way to appreciate this is not by reading reviews but by reading the actual book/story."
2329,Matteos,"1984 takes place in London, England in what is now part of one of the three world powers, the others being Eurasia and Eastasia, Oceania is a basically communist society in which there is one totalitarian government which consists of the Inner Party (rich), the party (middle class), and Proles (proletarians). The one thing that makes this government really work is the deprivation of emotions, the constant watching, and the fear of its people. I think one of the main themes of the book was that it was a warning of what could happen if we continued on the our path. It also showed many similarities to totalitarian dictatorships such as Nazi Germany. Like even though the Party does not directly prosecute the proles the are treated as inferiors like the Jewish people were as shown here, ""The Party taught taught that the Proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection,""(71).One of the things that I really liked about this book is that it made me think of the things that a government like the one in 1984 can do to a person like alter the past and that is a scary thing for a person or even an entire event can just disappear with the snap of a finger not one question about it not one way to prove it wrong. Another thing I also liked about the book is that even though it was a slow moving book it never became actually boring because it just made you think about what was happening. Although 1984 did not come true in 1984 it still has a great possibility of happening today. "

2331,Jusmalia Oktaviani,"I do believe this novel should go into 'horror' shelves, even 'thriller' is too good for this book. During reading '1984', I couldn’t stop shake my head. This novel should be one of the scariest book I've ever read. I feel shiver, depressed, and curious at the same time. Not a long ago, I have read another Orwell's book, Animal Farm, and I got the first impression that Orwell’s strength is his imagination about how the ideal political system should be run. Alike with Animal Farm, '1984' is also a good guide for student of politics, so they can clearly know what it feels living under a totalitarian regime that very strict, and rules people’s life in every detail—people basically have no rights to own everything, every material belongs to Party, and Party have scheduled people’s daily activity. Orwell wrote it so well, made me almost feel hard to breathe at the same time as he told the story thoroughly—I was amazed of his detail in building how totalitarian-world-would-be. This novel really affected me so much afterwards, and for me ‘1984’ deserves 5 stars."

2336,Ethan Oostdyk,"As far as socialistic governments go, George Orwell has imagined the worst case scenario. It is the year 1984. The countries are divided into three super nations, Oceana being the nation that 1984 takes place in. The government is suppressing free thought via agents called the thought police. Every person is being watched through telescreens, their behavior scrutinized and examined. It is dangerous to even reveal emotions and facial expressions. English is being replaced by NewSpeak, a language which effectively eliminates creativity. Ignorance is being shoved down the throats of the people – hence the Party’s paradox slogan “War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength.” Children are even encouraged to turn their parents over to the Police for denouncing Ingsoc - the socialistic advance of the governent. The party is broken up into three groups: the inner party, the outer party, and the Proles. The inner party is composed of about 2% of the nation’s population, wherein all the Party’s deepest secrets are kept. The outer party is about 15% of the population, and despite its workers working inside the government with insidious tasks (such as the doctoring of historical notes to meet the Party’s standards) they are still kept relatively ignorant of truth. The Proles (the lower class) who make up the rest of Oceana’s population are completely unaware of the things that go on outside of what the party informs them, and are hardly monitored at all by the telescreens. Big Brother is the omnipotent head of all government in Oceana. Big Brother is watching you.The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a resident of the province Airstrip One. He is a worker for Minitru, (named in NewSpeak) and has the job of rewriting historical documents. Intrigued by learning the truth of the past Winston is a Rebel of the Party in his own mind. A thought Criminal. The punishment for thoughtcrime is death, and if he reveals one iota of his secret, the Thought Police will be on him like a starving animal on a 16 ounce sirloin.Orwell compellingly relates the fear Winston suffers through day to day, conveys the uncertainty through which he must faces his friends, and builds suspense with the deep mysteries of Oceana’s sadistic government. If you value your REM cycles, you should leave 1984 alone – it will have you staying up late on a regular basis to read just one more chapter."

2343,Amir ali,"داستان به طرزی زیبا کاملترین حالت یک حکومت استبدادی را توصیف میکند. اورول خیلی خوب توانسته اقدامات دولتها برای کنترل مردم را چه به طور مستقیم و چه غیرمستقیم شرح دهد. استفادۀ حزب از تکنولوژی و مخصوصاً صفحه های سخنگو که هم مردم را تحت نظر داشته و هم برای تبلیغات سیاسی استفاده میشوند (و این کاربرد دوم بسیار شبیه تلویزیون در دنیای ماست) نمونه ای از این موضوع است. همچنین استفاده از کودکان و آماده سازی آنها از همان دوران کودکی برای دفاع از آرمانهای حزب یکی دیگر از فعالیتهای مهم حزب را تشکیل میدهد. (موضوع کار بر روی افکار کودکان و آماده سازی آنها برای کسب اهداف سیاسی در آینده در دیگر اثر معروف نویسنده ""مزرعۀ حیوانات"" هم دیده میشود، آنجا که ناپلئون نه توله سگ را مخفیانه بزرگ کرده و مدتی بعد از آنها برای کسب قدرت در مزرعه استفاده میکند.) حزب همچنین طبقۀ کارگر را با تفریحاتی مانند خرید وفروش بلیط های بخت آزمایی به شدت سرگرم کرده است.اما احتمالاً جالبترین ایده ای که در این کتاب بیان میشود استفادۀ حزب از زبان برای اطمینان از تداوم حکومت خود است. حزب زبانی جدید و ساده ایجاد کرده است که در آن کلمه ای برای بیان مطالبی که با آرمانهای حزب در تضاد هستند وجود ندارد. بنابراین مردم نمیتوانند در مورد موضوعی مثل آزادی صحبت و یا حتی فکرکنند. این زبان newspeak یا زبان جدید نامیده میشود.کار دیگری که حزب انجام میدهد استفاده از doublethink یا دوگانه باوری است. Doublethink عبارتست از قبول کردن همزمان دو مفهوم متضاد. برای مثال افرادی که مسئول تغییر دادن مداوم اسناد تاریخی هستند با آنکه خود این عمل را انجام میدهند باز هم کاملاً این اسناد را معتبر میدانند. حتی نام وزارتهای چهارگانۀ اوشنیا هم به نوعی تمرین doublethink است: وزارت عشق محل شکنجه است، وزارت فراوانی دلیل قحطی ها، وزارت صلح مسئول رسیدگی به مسائل مربوط به جنگ و وزارت حقیقت محل تغییر اسناد تاریخی و آماده سازی دروغ ها وتبلیغات سیاسی. شعار اصلی حزب هم نمونۀ کامل و پرمفهومی از doublethink است: جنگ صلح است، آزادی بردگیست، جهالت قدرت است. (باید اشاره شود که مفهوم doublethink هر چند عجیب به نظر می آید امروزه کاربرد زیادی در سیاست دارد. برای مثال مردم آمریکا از جنگ برای برقراری صلح حمایت میکنند و یا در عین حال که اعتقاد دارند کشورشان حامی دمکراسی است روابط نزدیک آن با حکومتهای غیر دمکراتیک مانند بسیاری از کشورهای خاورمیانه را نیز میپذیرند.)کتاب 1984 به دلیل تاثیر زیادی که بر ادبیات داشته باعث ایجاد دست کم چهار کلمۀ جدید در زبان انگلیسی شده است:doublethink: پذیرش همزمان دو مفهوم متضاد مخصوصاً در نتیجۀ تلقین فکری سیاسیthoughtcrime: جرم فکریnewspeak: زبانی دوپهلو و نامفهوم که در تبلیغات سیاسی استفاده شودbig brother: شخصی که قدرت کامل در حکومتی معمولاً استبدادی دارداین اثر همواره جزو ده رمان برتر قرن بیستم شناخته شده و همچنین در نظرخواهی انجام شده از خوانندگان مجلۀ تایم که حدود سه سال پیش انجام شد به عنوان برترین رمان در طول تاریخ انتخاب شد.

2347,Ahmed Dawod,Wow ...... I had to start my review with that word. George Orwell has really did it in this novel. It is BRILLIANT with all the meanings of the word. He imagined a whole system of a country and a society. A perfect one which can be logically achieved. He invented everything in the novel literally. You will know when you read it. He actually invented everything even a language. The 'Book of Goldstien' is the masterpiece of Orwell. I totally recommend it to everyone. You will not believe that this book was written in 1948.

2350,Donald,"""1984"" is one of my two favorite books of all time. George Orwell created the perfect paranoid masterpiece, and his work has proven to be all too accurate with its nightmarish future view of our world. So many words and phrases from ""1984"" have become part of our common, everyday vocabulary; ""big brother,"" ""thought police,"" ""memory hole,"" ""comrade,"" are just a few of the most memorable. This book was tremendously influential in my own writing, and you can find echoes of it throughout my novel ""The Unreals."" The fact that it is still required reading in many high school english classes is one of the few encouraging signs from our public school system. "
2351,Anastasia,"2 + 2 = 5If you say or even think otherwise, you're committing thoughtcrime. The Party knows it and you will be punished accordingly. You're also not allowed to love, laugh, feel pleasure, write journals or have friends. All that could jeopardize your loyalty for the Party or worse, your love for Big Brother. What's funny is that the action takes place in 1984 and it's presented as a futuristic hopeless society, because the author took the world order of that time (1949) and envisioned a future where socialism continued and evolved into a horrid form of control of the masses. This book makes us realize what the people of the fifties had in mind regarding their future. They were terrified of a Government that wouldn't settle for controlling their food ratio, their property or their workplace, that would go further than the material world and do everything in their power to control the minds of the population. It's a sad story, a fictional and at the same time a very realistic scenario. Today, sadly, it's also a very probable scenario, because there's bound to be a time in our lives when power consumes people to the brink of insanity. "

2353,Matt,"Love this book. Orwell at his bright-eyed, insightful best. It has some serious weaknesses as a novel. He's a smart man who could write a good novel (Burmese Days is one of my favorites). But I don't think he was content for 1984 to be merely a novel, so I gladly overlook the fact this is a hybrid of essay and fiction. For an ardent socialist, Orwell has the unusual distinction of writing some of the best critical works on that political philosophy with Animal Farm, The Road to Wigan Pier, and 1984. Makes me wonder where he stood at the end of his life, with 1984 coming as his last major work. Animal Farm was clearly an allegory of Stalinism. Wigan Pier was an attempt to address criticisms head on. Neither of those explanations fully (remotely, really) explains why he wrote 1984....Orwell on language has always fascinated me too. Between reading Richard Rorty, a proponent of contingent vocabularies (a belief that our words frame and limit ideas and that different vocabularies would lead us to different ways of viewing the world and truth because there is no single, organizing truth; everything is contingent), and the recent handling of an eruption of political scandals along with the re-branding American political discourse in general (e.g. how discussion of abortion can now be short-handed as ""women's health""), Orwell seems as prescient, timely, and relevant as ever. However, I worry that Orwell will one day be seen as a ""how to"" guide rather than warning."
2354,Lucy Gray,"Wow, I had heard so much about this book and it definitely came up to my expectations. It was as scary and sad as I had hoped. It required concentration and was quite hard to read (especially compared to Animal Farm (and the Stephen King's which I have been reading!) but I was reading an old Penguin Classic version with tiny font and I knew that the language would be formal and complex. I almost want to use double speak myself on occasion and I am sure I will understand more references to 1984 now I have read the book. "

2356,Sherif,"For me it was not as much a novel as it was a description of the worst oppressive regime possible. The dystopia that Orwell described was far beyond my imagination. The fact that a government could torture someone physically, torment him emotionally and mentally and manipulate the human nature in the way described in the 3rd part of the book just to stay in power was terrifying. There were, as I expected, many projections into real life; either in history or in the current political affairs. For instance, the concept of erasing someone from the records was actually used, in a much less intense way, in the soviet union by Stalin. It is worth noting that throughout the book, it didn't feel like it was written 65 years ago"

I think it encourages a healthy attitude wherein you learn to think for yourself and learn to look into things rather than naively believing what everyone tells you is the right thing to do or the right activity to enjoy."
2359,Randy,"Brief synopsis of story: (1-2 paragraphs).Winston Smith lives in the empire of Oceania under the watchful totalitarian eye of Big Brother. Civil war and a movement called Ingsoc (English Socialism) have reshaped the Western world for the worse. Oceania is under control of the Party and the Party controls all….including reality. It is a world full of hidden microphones, secret police, and two-way telescreens that apprehend all. A world in which privacy is scarce and, in some ways, dangerous.Winston spends his days as civil servant in the MiniTrue RecDep revising history and deleting “unpersons” from the official record. There he meets Julia, a mechanic and member of the Anti-sex League after she secretly hands him a note that says: “I love you.” They begin an illicit affair and meet O’Brien, an Inner Party member who may actually be a member of rebel faction called the Brotherhood. However it turns out that O’Brien and Big Brother have been on to them all along. Winston and Julia are captured and finally tortured and re-conditioned for re-integration by exposure to their deepest fears. Separated and alone, Julia and Winston betray each other and in the closing chapters we find Winston an alcoholic, alone and reconciled to (indeed, sincerely accepting) Big Brothers rule. Crushed beneath the wheels.Kind of work defined by basic elements (character, plot, setting, language, theme)—what elements are foregrounded? How do they fit together?:1984 is the bleakest of bleak futurism. Big Brother’s reach extends not only into the daily lives of the citizens of Oceania, but into the fabric of reality itself. Orwell explores and illustrates concepts like Newspeak and Doublethink, processes through which meaning is twisted and negated. Through language and conditional thinking, the party is able to create a shifting and mutable reality that suits whatever purpose is required at the time. For example, seditious person who has been eliminated by the Party is referred to as an ‘unperson’. An unperson then is deleted from all records and, through the process of Doublethink, is believed by all Party members to have never existed at all. As such there existence is systematically negated and perceived realities become unprovable. It is, in this sense, a culture of madness and denial.Kind of work defined by structure—how is it constructed? Orwell tells the story with a 3rd Person limited POV—namely exclusively Winston’s. In so doing, we get to inhabit his skin and feel the confusion, dread, and oppression of living under the watchful eye of Big Brother. This helps emphasize one of the major themes of the novel: the fate of the individual subsumed by the society in which he lives. What room is there for the individual in the machinery of power?Further, the limited perspective allows us to only know what Winston knows (while we suspect oh so much more), which helps Orwell create tension and dread as the novel hurtles toward its conclusion. We know fate will not be kind to Winston, but we cannot be sure from where the blow will come, or when, or from whom. Kind of work defined by theme, interests-- A clear reaction to authoritarianism, Orwell’s dominating message seems to be that man, as he progresses, may in that process become a soulless automaton without even being aware of it. A cog in the machinery of the culture he has created and in which he expends his energy endlessly without result like a hamster on a wheel. Secondary is the fragility of our own belief systems—how easily and how effectively they may be supplanted by a system of negation similar to the one employed by the Party. Orwell posits the value of the individual—a value the Western world holds dear—is null in the face of absolute power. As O’Brien states: “…If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face . . . forever.” The state holds sway over the individual, influencing thought and action through piped ideology and forced nationalism. Indeed, xenophobia is a powerful force for the Party. By channeling the tension of the masses toward their perpetually warring rivals, the Party effectively negates that energy being directed toward itself.Finally, your overall analysis of this piece holistically  I find Nineteen Eight-Four to be one of the most terrifying visions of a human future possible. A future of complete abjection and abnegation of the self. A place where the needs of the state are served by the reality the state creates and all power is directed toward the retention of power. This is a society of purposelessness in a sense. Like consumerism, the state here only requires the acquisition and consolidation (only instead of goods and resources, power). There is no higher striving, no attempt to pioneer or progress, but a stasis of power. For that is what those in power really crave—a constant stable state. Change is the enemy. It creates opportunity for those not in power and it challenges established authority.All of this Orwell has adroitly thought out and detailed in the novel. The perpetual war creates a constant state of disorientation. By limiting thought and resources, the avenues for change are choked. By dissuading any outward signs of intellectualism or pleasure, the inward desire for those basic ideals is muted. By forcing citizens to swallow nonsensical (but purposed) language and concepts like Double Think, they condition a population to accept a permanently mutable reality dictated by the state for the state.Now that you have read and considered this work in the context of your own ongoing research and writing, how does this work inform that work?While I likely have a more optimistic view of human nature than Orwell, I still find the fundamental themes applicable. Here, Orwell reacts, as Erich Fromm suggests, to a “new form of managerial industrialism, in which man builds machines which act like men and develop ment who act like machines…” Strange that we would strive to build things in our most ideal image and yet dehumanize ourselves. So the question for me becomes…what happens to the same idea in the context of our blossoming biological and technological future? As culture evolves, how are these tropes transformed and how are they similar?"
2360,Temeika  Beasley - Spruiells ,"1984 Follows Winston Smith a citizen of Oceania, a totalitarian society. The high ranking members of this regime maintain control with constant monitoring through the ""telescreen"", citizens observing each other, and a law enforcement outfit called the Thought Police. This dystopian novel provides vivid imagery of a depressed, urban community, and its inhabitants as they succumb to the oppressive guidelines imposed to combat any ideas that did not originate with their authoritarian government. Winston faces physical and mental challenges as he battles to maintain the few bits left of his independent thought.Winston works in The Ministry of Truth, an institution designed to revise history and print language as needed, to align with the ideals of the party. Big Brother serves as an all seeing erie figure in almost every scene. This personification of the Oceanic government promotes an allegiance to a ""friend"" rather that the party. Julia, a beautiful young girl joins Winston's journey of outright rebellion and civil-disobedience, introducing him to the possibilities of escaping his tyrannical environment. George Orwell served as a civil servant during his life and noted perilous injustices with the rise of Stalin and Hitler. He first brought attention to authoritarian regimes in ""Animal Farm"", 1945, where he satirically told of the transition from Lenin to Stalin, favoring a fabled style delivery. It also had an inconspicuous moral lesson and could function as sheer entertainment without any acknowledgment of the undertones attacking authoritarian governments . Although Nineteen Eighty- Four served as a fictional account of a dystopian society, Orwell's warning was more direct to individuals that allow the stripping away of freedoms for the sake of governmental control.This is an excellent book. I give it five stars for the vivid imagery, as it allowed me to explore every one of my senses without ever leaving a room. Orwell has an abundance elements employed throughout this piece that can be analogous with any civilization witnessing the crumbling of a democratic society. This dark lyrical work of art will provide discussion for decades. It is best read exploring Orwell's background and the history prevailing during the time written."
2361,Nikolas Kalar,"And here it is. Orwell's dystopian masterpiece. Like Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange, 1984 succeeds in depicting its failed society with a certain amount of special cutting commentary. 1984, despite what it appears to be, isn't about the totality of governments, but of people, the totality of love. And where as A Clockwork Orange wears that message on its sleeve, Orwell cleverly hides his message from the reader until long after the work is finished. "
2362,Nikolas Carraway,"1984 is a staple of post-apocalyptic, dystopian science fiction. Frightening when it was first published, it has only grown more and more chilling to modern readers due to startling parallels between the totalitarian regime of Oceania and modern Western society. Ask yourself this question: Is screaming like a lunatic at a rival sports team that much different than the two minutes hate? Isn't America's history of almost constant war and conflict reminiscent of the constant state of war between East-Asia and Eurasia? Hidden within the story of government oppression and a world which is slowly becoming more and more in control of the party and the people is a moving love story between two Inner Party members. But in a world like this, is there really such a thing as love in the way we know it now? Is there any defeating a regime of control and oppression when the people being kept down by the system are simultaneously in love with it? These are the terrifying questions George Orwell asks us. You may find yourself afraid of the answers. "
2363,Vanessa,"La verdad es que me satisfizo mucho esta distopía; nació de la mano de un (según muchos escritores que se dedicaron a estudiar su vida) socialista que conoció y repudió los regímenes de tipo totalitaristas impregnados de fascismo; por lo que esta obra resultó siendo una sátira de esos dos movimientos socio-políticos. 1984 by George Orwell es una obra fascinante que disfruté desde su inicio hasta su final; en donde, como pocas veces me pasa, me gustaron más sus antagonistas que su propio protagonista, ya que me resultaron mucho más complejos e interesantes. El mundo que Orwell pintó es grandioso (y no en el buen sentido de la palabra), es un mundo lleno de odio, de miseria, de ignorancia y de mucha manipulación. Manipulación de la verdad, del pasado, del presente, del futuro, de la familia, de los placeres, del vocabulario, del pensar y del actuar en general. En el ámbito político está compuesto por el Partido, cuya figura principal es el Gran Hermano (quien no es una persona en específico, sino la conglomeración de la innumerable cantidad de individuos que integran al Partido); en ese gobierno hay tres eslóganes que resumen de manera bien breve los inconcebibles fines principales del Estado: LA GUERRA ES LA PAZ, LA LIBERTAD ES LA ESCLAVITUD, LA IGNORANCIA ES LA FUERZA.Así mismo, existen tres ministerios, 
el ministerio de la verdad:
 cuya tarea es manipular los hechos del pasado escritos en libros y periódicos para que el mismo coincida con lo que el Partido dice en el presente, es decir, se manipula así el pasado para que lo que el Gran Hermano dicte sea la total y absoluta verdad. 
El ministerio del amor
, en el cual se torturaba, o como el Partido decía, ""se reeducaba"", a todo individuo que tuviese pensamientos o cometiera actos en contra de la ideología del Gran Hermano, enseñando pues, a amar al mismo quebrando a las personas a través de inimaginables y enfermizos martirios. 
El ministerio de la abundancia
 que velaba porque predominara siempre un clima de mero racionamiento excesivo, en el que nadie disfrutara de ventajas, y en el que el pueblo en general pasara hambre, en donde se sufriera para conseguir productos básicos y no contara con buenos servicios (pues el Partido no creía provechosa la distribución de la riqueza). Y por último, 
el ministerio de la paz
, que se encargaba de todo lo relacionado a la guerra continua que se pretendía llevar a cabo, la cual era considerada ventajosa para poder permanecer indefinidamente en el poder, puesto que la misma era ficticia pero servía de medio de salida/aliviadero del odio y el miedo contenido en el alma del pueblo. Ahora pues, esto es una mínima parte de todo lo contenido en el libro, y después de haberlo terminado considero que todos deberían darle al menos una hojeada, principalmente las personas de mi país, (es obvio que no nos encontramos en una situación tan extrema, el libro es fantasía distópica, es decir, no es más que ficción), es útil para ver en qué monstruo tan horrible se puede convertir, en sus últimas fases, un gobierno dictatorial y totalitarista.  El poder no es un medio, sino el fin en sí mismo. No se establece una dictadura para salvaguardar una revolución; se hace revolución para establecer una dictadura. "
2364,Ann Schwader,"This was a reread for me -- and obviously a much-needed one. I only gave this book four stars in my original rating, and now I can't imagine why.If you haven't read 1984 since you were in school, please don't make the same mistake I've been making for years now. Make time for it again as an adult. You'll appreciate the elegance of the prose far more, and probably be even more disturbed by its implications than you were the first time.I know I was."
2365,André Benjamim,"A morte do líder querido, Kim Jong-il, reavivou-me na memória a história de Winston Smith, protagonista de 1984, romance distópico de George Orwell. Qualquer semelhança entre a Oceânia, em 1984, e a Coreia do Norte, pode não ser pura coincidência. Coincidência é o romance ter sido escrito, ou acabado, no ano em que o grande líder eterno, Kim Il-sung, chegou ao poder. 1948.Num momento em que a Europa caminha a passos lestos para um paradigma que, à semelhança da China, junta o pior de dois mundos, o pior do capitalismo e o pior do comunismo, esta é uma obra a ter em atenção. Para sabermos aquilo que nos espera, ou para sabermos aquilo que temos que evitar que aconteça. O Grande Irmão, Big Brother, indica-nos o caminho, diz o que temos que pensar, como temos que o pensar, de preferência não devemos pensar, o que temos que fazer, como o fazer, não importa porque é que temos que o fazer, como temos que viver, onde temos que viver, com quem podemos viver. Só há um pensamento, só há uma visão do mundo, só há um destino, só há um caminho. Neste grande plano desenhado pelo Grande Irmão, o grande líder, querido e eterno, as pessoas são um pequeno, pequeníssimo pormenor, sem importância nenhuma. As pessoas já não são pessoas, pensar é crime (o duplopensar), amar é proibido (a cópula só pode ter fins reprodutivos, e não pode envolver emoções: é apenas um acto físico ao serviço do partido), e quem vai contra a ideologia (crimepensar, o mais grave dos crimes, que no fundo encerra todos os outros) é simplesmente apagado, transforma-se uma impessoa (uma pessoa que a máquina do partido se encarrega de fazer desaparecer de todo e de qualquer registo, de modo a que não só deixe de existir, mas de maneira a que nunca tenha existido). Qualquer semelhança entre o mundo do Grande Irmão, com a sua ideia única, o seu caminho único, e a sua visão única, as únicas admissíveis, as únicas possíveis, e o trilho da Austeridade da Europa, do não há alternativa, não é pura coincidência.Há sempre outro caminho, há sempre outra solução, há sempre alternativa. Enquanto houver um homem ou uma mulher, como Winston Smith ou Júlia, que se recusem a não-pensar e a não-sentir, haverá sempre outro caminho. Ainda que no fim a grande máquina trucidante nos engula com as suas mandíbulas, cabe-nos resistir. Resistir sempre, a qualquer tipo de autoritarismo, de esquerda ou de direita, dos governos ou dos mercados, do comunismo ou do capitalismo, do socialismo ou do fascismo. Resistir sempre, resistir a qualquer opressão."

2368,Jill,"Orwell's most famous work, ""Nineteen Eighty Four"", written in 1949 is still as gripping, poignant and terrifying as it must have been over 60 years ago. My review is for the unabridged audio CD, skillfully read by Simon Prebble. Orwell describes a dystopian society in the country of Oceania, in which war is permanent, government surveillance is widespread, individualism and all forms of self expression are suppressed, and ""big brother"" is watching. Though this novel has been on every ""Top 100"" reading list as well as high school and college curriculums for decades, somehow I had put off reading it until now. I was quite surprised at how relevant it still is, ensuring that it will remain on required reading lists for many decades to come.The main character, Winston Smith, works at the Ministry of Truth, as part of a team that is constantly rewriting history to suit the purposes of the current party line. No one is sure who ""big brother"" really is, or even if such a person exists. Citizens are constantly programmed with ""double think"" phrases such as ""Ignorance is strength"", ""war is peace"", and ""freedom is slavery"". They fear the thought police who will punish them severely for not adhering to party teachings, even in their thoughts. Society is plagued by constant shortages, scarcity and hardships, primarily due to constant wars. The Machine believes in constant warfare to get rid of materials that might make the masses comfortable and complacent. The Party's main purpose is to mold the consciousness of the masses, and was described at one point as a ""boot stamping on a human face.""The themes of nationalism, censorship and surveillance are just as relevant today as they were over 60 years ago, ensuring that this novel will remain in the forefront of literature for a long time to come. It's not an easy book to read, since the deprivation, brainwashing and torture are hard to endure. However, I suspect that I will read it again and again because of the many levels of meaning and message."
2369,Sakina Ahmad,"I thought that this book was amazing and horrific at the same time. It was so well written, and yet so simple at the same time. This book has to be the best horror book I have ever read. I have read some horror stories, and even watched some scary movies, but this book takes the cake. A world where you can't even have your own private thoughts to yourself, where instead of you watching TV, the TV is closely watching you. You can be arrested at any moment for any crime, you could even be arrested in your sleep for sleep talking. What any amazing concept that people would have so little freedom, but at the same time would be so content with it. It was definitely a good book to read. It was very frightening in the sense that it was unfortunately so realistic. It was realistic in the sense that I feel that after reading this book, that we as the human race come closer and closer to dehumanizing ourselves, and to become more robotic and no individuality. To have no emotions, and to be punished for them is very frightening. After I read this book, my chest would not stop hurting. You know a book is really amazing when it leaves you breathless. It really gripped me a the throat, and I honestly did not think that was possible. It was only a book I kept telling myself, but it felt like the idea of society becoming a working machine rather than a place with individuals and their emotions are coming closer and closer together. I hope I will never see the day where people are dehumanized into nothing more than empty hearted machinery, with the only reason for being is to accept their slavery and to have no type of thought going through their own minds. I shudder at the thought. "
2370,Kat Hilton,"I read this book in high school. It was during my ""awakening period."" I really just didn't really care about school, reading, or the world around me before this time. I was a late-bloomer, I was just too busy being a kid wanting to play all the time. I heard some others talking about it, so I gave it a try. I liked the romance part of it a lot. But, this book is so much more. I think it is a must read for young adults who are just learning about the world around them. I also read ""Animal Farm' by him too. Both great books."
2371,Liz* Fashionably Late," “He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.” I really enjoyed this reading. It took me a while to finish it and that's probably because I had the need to stop to think about some interesting passages every few pages. More than a novel it felt like and essay and there was this urgency to consider about a lot Orwell had to say. I won't attempt to make a review here, just give a few thoughts about 1984. I was captivated by the term ""doublethink"", the idea of a hierarchical society that was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance and finally the realization that you won't win against the Big Brother. And for me, this was exquisite:“Being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.” What does it mean to be mad or rational? Sanity is not statistical."
2372,Rubens Granja,"Extremamente atual. Denso, questionador, dramático e, em certa medida, positivamente repulsivo..."
2373,Aya,"It creeped me out in ever single page. Shudder-wprthy but breathtaking, this book made me work my way into the mindset of people that now, in the year 2015 live just like that, with very breath they take under close surveilance, no personal life, no choices even in the most simple of matters. Their children are taught to have no thoughts of their own, to embrace what those few in power want them to think without any question. The people who dare develop their own thoughts are the nuisances of this world, not its guiding light and are tortured till they renounce everything that is not in accordance with the system's believes and then ostracized and awaiting their own death, that now seems like a way out of hell and not a way in. It made me appreciate every single ounce of freedom I have and undestand just how precious it really is. It's something you have to fight to keep and not take it as a given because in reality it's not and there are many people out there who would snatch it away in the blink of an eye. I highly recommend it to everyone- over 15 years old that is! ;)"
2374,Stella,"What can i say about this magnificent book. Orwell's ""1984"" is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. A realistic approach to a totalitarian and bureaucratic nightmarish society/world where love is forbidden,language is being distorted according to the rules of the Party this dystopian novel left me craving for more page after page. A 5+ star rating from me!! ""WAR is peace. FREEDOM is slavery. IGNORANCE is strength. """
2375,Sankrutyayan,"Definitely one of the most terrifying things I have read. Little by little, the Party devoured on the small flickering hope in the minds of the people who believed in Brotherhood. The Party does not want to kill you for going against the Big Brother but they want to reason with you, make you believe in what they think is right or at least what they want you to believe is right. 1984 is a prediction, a terrorizing prediction where ignorance of the people reigns the world in disguise. There is only one thing they cannot discern, that is your thoughts but soon they will control that too. There is no right or wrong, there is only the thing which lets you live. There is no escape even in your sleep, there is no one who can save you except death. 1984 is the whole new definition of utter hopelessness, despondency, misery. But only to the population ready to revolt or who think away from the bogus facts, to others it is the way of life since the dawn of human kind. Privacy will be invaded, every action is being watched even while sleeping. Your own children will denounce you to the Though Police.I read the first few pages several times before I actually picked it up for an uninterrupted reading. I could not bear the idea of Dystopia. I do not know what is left of the humanity if it could not express its feelings, thanks to Newspeak. It was really a pitiful world when we come across Mr.Parson who thanks the Party for not letting him go beyond what he is capable of, in terms of going against the Big Brother. After reading this I got a better outline of the conditions we live in and how alert we should be in order to safeguard our freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of thought.Most depressing of all is - He loved Big Brother. "
2376,Adriana,"This book was like reading a trilogy. So much cliff hangers... so much depth, fear, love, hate, anger while reading it. It angered me, espicially when comparing it to what is my reality. This book is brilliant by the reality feeling to this science fiction, that is barely fiction. It is articulate, clear. The ending stroke me like lightning ... I love it. It is exactly what I like... a book that angers me."
2377,Ross Bussell,"I never read this as a teenager in high school or in college, so I had to find out what the fuss was about. I was totally and completely floored by this book, it was one of the best things I've ever read. It's a rare thing for me to keep notes on a book, but I did with this, my wife thought I was nuts, like I was studying for a lit exam or something. This book should be required reading for EVERYONE... OR ELSE!!!!!"
2378,Ben Peyton,"Probably the best inadvertent Halloween book I could have picked up this month. I'm sure I was suppose to read this at some point in my schooling but I never did but I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much then as I did now. It would have been wasted on dumb 16 year-old Ben. I know this book is almost a cliche at this point, it is used as a metaphor for a lot of things but if you haven't read this yet I strongly recommend it. I know I said the last book I read was the best one I've finished this year but this one might be number 1 and that one 1A."
2379,The Pixie Reader,"
If you can feel that staying human is worth while, even when it can't have any result whatever, you've beaten them.
What thought-provoking and insightful novel. A truly compelling analysis of the psychology of power and human nature. This was one of the most intense reading sessions I've ever had. I would often forget I am in the safety in my own bed and experience alarming levels of anxiety.I sympathized with Winston from the first pages, even though he wasn't exactly a likable character. His experiences and emotions seemed so genuine that he felt like a real person to me. A real person stuck in one of my ultimate-nightmare scenarios. Big Brother, IngSoc, Newspeak, the Ministry of Love, the Ministry of Truth, Room 101, the telescreens, all represent horrid concepts I hope people will forcefully fight against whenever they're confronted with them. In addition to the captivating plot, I savored the writing style as well. My favorite paragraph from the book was that in which Winston was recalling fragments about his childhood, especially about his mother. I remember thinking that it was one of the most beautiful pieces of writing I've read in a long time. Another part of this book I thoroughly enjoyed was Goldstein's essay. I think it's a sagacious take on society.The world envisioned in 1984 did not quite materialize, though some people might argue that it actually did, but in a more subtle manner. With all the regulations and surveillance people face today it could all go terribly wrong, if the power ended up in the wrong hands. Beyond it being an engaging, beautifully written book, this represents quite a milestone in my life. It forced me to think about what kind of a person I would want to be when faced with dire circumstances, it made me reevaluate some of my ideals and principles. "
2380,Agua De Calcetín,"Buenas las tengan (las tardes, noches o días, no sean mal pensados) estimados lectores calcetineros, en esta ocasión les traemos “lo que viene siendo” una reseña de una novela, nada más y nada menos que 1984 de George Orwell, así que a darle que es mole de olla. Esta novela es un tanto difícil de describir: es rica en muchos temas y encasillarla en un solo género es complicado, yo diría que es de reflexión, política, ciencia ficción y un poco de lingüística, entre otros.En “1984”, Orwell nos muestra su visón de un futuro distópico en donde el gobierno manipula la información (histórica, por ejemplo); existe la vigilancia masiva por parte del gobierno y sobre todo una gran y violenta represión política y social (no muy lejano a nuestro mundo actual, si me lo preguntan a mí). 1984 está considerada como una de las obras de la llamada “trilogía de las distopías de principios del siglo XX”, junto con Un Mundo Feliz (1932) de Aldous Huxley y Fahrenheit 451 (1953) de Ray Bradbury (la cual como dato curioso fue publicada inicialmente de manera serial en la revista Playboy, ya saben por temas de censura de la época, extraño, ¿¿no??).Regresando al tema, la novela 1984 se localiza en una futura Londres, parte de una región llamada Franja Aérea 1, que “… alguna vez fue llamada Inglaterra o Britania” integrada, a su vez, en un inmenso estado colectivista: Oceanía. La sociedad de Oceanía está dividida en tres grupos. Los miembros “externos” del Partido Único, los miembros del Consejo dirigente, o círculo interior del partido, y una masa de gente a la que el Partido mantiene pobre y entretenida para que no puedan ni quieran rebelarse, los proles (¿alguna semejanza con algo que conozcan?). Los miembros “externos” constituyen la burocracia del aparato estatal (de ahí la necesidad de la estricta vigilancia), viven sometidos a un control asfixiante y a una propaganda alienante que los desmoraliza y les impide pensar críticamente. El estado suprime todo derecho y los condena a una existencia poco más que miserable, con riesgo de perder la vida o sufrir vejámenes espantosos, si no que demostrasen suficiente fidelidad y adhesión a la causa nacional. Para ello se organizan numerosas manifestaciones donde se requiere la participación activa de los miembros, gritando las consignas favorables al partido, vociferando contra los supuestos traidores, dando rienda suelta al más desaforado fanatismo. Solo con fervor fanático se puede escapar a la omnipresente vigilancia de la policía del pensamiento.En varios puntos de la novela, Orwell nos comparte su visión y crítica política de la sociedad, nos muestra con crudeza muchos escenarios, particularmente recuerdo uno en el que describe la “guerra de las clases sociales”. La clase alta y la clase media están en perpetua guerra, tomando y quitándose el poder y el dinero una y otra vez con el sobrenombre de “revoluciones” y así ha sucedido durante toda la historia, la clase media le arrebata el poder y el dinero a la alta y se convierte en la nueva clase alta y quien usan como sus peones, pues a la clase baja, la cual tiene un verdadero y enorme poder (por sus números para empezar), solo que no lo saben ni nuca podrán usarlo, esto porque siempre estarán distraídos de una u otra forma, por ejemplo intentando sobrevivir, o bien viendo la televisión o jugando a la lotería esperando por fin poder dejar de ser proles, e incluso si lo dejaran de ser, solo pasarían a ser la nueva clase alta o media y todo se reconfiguraría de la misma forma, es decir, se descarta que alguna vez la sociedad humana pueda vivir en una comunidad o colectividad igualitaria.En esta visión distópica del futuro, Orwell nos presenta a un famoso personaje (o concepto): El Gran Hermano, suple a todo personaje político: él es el comandante en jefe, el guardián de la sociedad, el dios pagano y el juez supremo. Él es la encarnación de los ideales del Partido, el Partido ubicuo, único y todopoderoso que vigila sin descanso todas las actividades cotidianas de la población, al punto que inclusive, en las calles y casas hay dispositivos de vigilancia para conocer todos los actos de cada individuo (“telepantallas”). Irónicamente, Orwell insinúa la posibilidad de que el Gran Hermano ni siquiera sea una persona real, sino un mero ícono propagandístico. El lema del partido es el siguiente: Guerra es Paz, Libertad es Esclavitud, Ignorancia es Fuerza. Otro concepto interesante es la neolengua, adaptación del inglés en la que se reduce y se transforma el léxico con fines represivos, basándose en el principio de que lo que no forma parte de la lengua, no puede ser pensado.En fin, calcetineros, no seguiré quemándoles la historia, así que si les llamó la atención lo que han leído hasta ahora, pues échenle un ojo al librito, no se van a arrepentir. Me despido con un lema muy famoso de libro: “Aquel que controla el pasado, controla el futuro, aquel que controla el presente, controla el pasado”. Nota: sí, esta novela da origen al nombre de aquel “reality show” muy famoso de los 2000´s.Por Rafael Cabral."
2381,Lucas,"1984 is a book of how a lone human cannot remain humanistic in a world of cold, unconscious life. It speaks to the goodness and cleverness of the human spirit, but also its ability to be insanely cruel. I found it refreshing that the book acknowledged that, one all of the odds are stacked against you, a few smart moves can fix everything. Once greed and domination takes its toll for several years, it might take just as long to make a step in the opposite direction, as evident from Winston and Julia's recognition of their roles as martyrs. Ultimately, Winston and Julia's relationship is shattered, as they couldn't hold their sacred ideas together in their minds during the worst torture of their lives. 1984 is a cautionary novel of how man can turn into heartless, unfeeling, unaware beings right from under our noses. "
2382,"Tyler ""jesus!""","George Orwell was a major critic of large government. 1984 sets a picture of distopian future that portrays this criticism. In the book, the government of the supercontinent Oceania controls every aspect of life, while neglecting the proletarian slums at the same time. The ""proles"" come to represent something to the protagonist and the reader, that the only way to be happy in a world where one can only be quiet about what they see happen every day, is to not inform oneself of such things. Ignorance, in other words, is the only way to maintain the mind.Throughout the story, the protagonist (named Smith) meets a few people who want to resist the ever more tyrannical government. But, as the story progresses, the reader begins to realize the Smith is the only person who genuinely held these anti-government sentiments, because everyone else was far too brainwashed. In the very end, even Smith admits that he loves the Party.I believe this book is really directed to the group of people who say to themselves ""Oh, well the government is passing all these laws to protect me."" These are the same people who don't think false-flag operations such as the Reichstag fire and atrocities such as the Nazi Holocaust, the Crusades, and various other genocides are possible in this day and age, or at least not in such civilized countries as the United States or the United Kingdom.This book to me represents the absolute worst a country could get. Orwell writes in beautifully horrific and vivid language a persuasive story for those sheeple who genuinely trust their government. The beauty of the story, to me, is not the message ""Your government is lying to you,"" it is ""Open your eyes, shut your mouth, and see what is going on around you."" I'm glad I read this book because I feel it is relevant to the direction in which many developed countries are headed, and hopefully it will open more eyes than mine."
2383,Ismail Lagouilly,"I love this book, even how depressing and terrifying it was, still it was a good read !!I'm still surprised by Orwell's genius in writing such a book. But, worse I'm terrified of how plenty of countries have developed systems close to what Orwell's has imagined over than sixty years ago.""Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past."" - George Orwell, 1984This sentence made me stop for a minute or two just to think about it. It does illustrate the Party’s technique of using false history to control the past and then the future.Controlling people's minds by defining what is true and what is not, gives the party an ultimate power on everyone and everything. When every evidence on every fact going against the Party's ideology is either changed or destroyed, people lose all chances to become conscious.""Until they became conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious."" - George Orwell, 1984Analyzing this masterpiece can be long, but what is important to say is : this book is great !I highly recommend everyone to read this book :)"
2384,Miles Dracula,"totally captivating, a must read for anyone who is interested in politics, social inequality, or revolution. with a bleak and haunting ending"

Yeni dünya düzeni, devletler, siyasal sistem, felsefe kurgulandığı gibi, yeni bir dil bile oluşturulmuş. Romanın isminin hikayesi de değişik; aslında ilk baş 1982 ve 1983 düşünülmüş, yazar kitabı 1948′de bitirince 1984′e karar vermiş. Aslında daha da ileri bir tarih atansa iyi olurdu belki, ama yazar, çağdaşlarına çok yakında başlarına gelebilecek tehlikelerin senaryosunu yazdığı için, çok ileri tarih de amaca ters düşebilirdi.- Devamını lütfen blogumuzdan okuyunuz: http://altbaslik.com/#sthash.0LiuuYiK..."
2386,Penny,I don't think I can do justice to just how brilliant this book is. All I can say is read it. It speaks better for itself than I ever could.
2387,Saud Omar,"تنبيه :في مراجعة الرواية هذه لا يوجد حرق للرواية. في هذه المراجعة يتم استعراض عقدة الرواية الأساسية. كل ما كٌتب هنا بدا لي أنه سوف يجعلك تقرأ الرواية بشكل أفضل. هذه المراجعة كٌتبت خصيصاً لأولئك الذين لم يقرءوا الرواية بعد***من مدونتي: ثمانون كتابا بحثا عن مخرجhttps://saudomar.wordpress.com***صدرت رواية “1984″ في عام 1949, وهي رواية سياسية دسيوتوبية, ومصطلح “يوتوبيا” يعني “العالم المثالي”, أو بالأخص “الحضارة المثالية” وخصوصاً في الجانب السياسي والاجتماعي منها, ومصطلح “دسيوتوبيا” يشير للفكرة المعاكسة من ذلك؛ والتي تعني المجتمع القائم على القمع والاستبداد.الرواية عبارة عن تصور وتحذير لمستقبل من الوارد جداً حدوثه, وتاريخ نشر الرواية هو في غاية الأهمية؛ فعنوان الرواية بالنسبة لتاريخ نشرها يلمّح بأن السيناريو المستقبلي المخيف المذكور فيها قد لا يكون بعيداً, بل إن العديد من المفكرين يظنون أنه قد تحقق جزء كبير منه, والعقبة التي تحول دون تحققه كلياً هي مجرد عقبة تكنولوجية؛ وبشيء من التطور العلمي والتكنولوجي قد يصبح عالمنا – إن لم يكن كذلك الآن – مثل عالم “1984″.تبدأ الرواية بالطبع في عام 1984 حيث العالم منقسم لثلاث دول: الدولة الأولى هي “أوشيانيا” (تمت ترجمتها لـ “أوقيانيا”), وهي عبارة عن الأمريكيتين واستراليا والجزر البريطانية. والدولة الثانية هي “أوراسيا”, وأراضيها هي روسيا والباقي من أوروبا. والدولة الثالثة هي “إيستاسيا” وتتكون من الصين واليابان وكوريا وشمال الهند. أما بالنسبة للشرق الأوسط, وجنوب الهند, وأفريقيا, فهي عبارة عن ساحات حرب ومناطق متنازع عليها من قبل هذه الدول الثلاث.أحداث الرواية تدور في دولة أوشيانيا حيث الأيدلوجية هناك هي الاشتراكية الإنجليزية أو ما يسميه الحزب الداخلي بـ (الإنجسوك), وحيث المجتمع هناك مقسم لثلاث طبقات: طبقة “الحزب الداخلي” ونسبتها اثنان بالمئة من السكان, وطبقة “الحزب الخارجي” ونسبتها ثلاثة عشرة بالمئة منهم, وأخيراً توجد طبقة “العامة”, وفوق هذه الطبقات كلها يوجد الحاكم المسيطر المستبد “الأخ الأكبر”؛ هذه الشخصية التي أصبحت من أكثر الشخصيات الروائية شهرة, بل إنها أصبحت رمزاً لأي عملية استبداد أو تجسس أو قمع. وبالمناسبة, سبب تسمية البرنامج التلفزيوني الشهير “الأخ الأكبر” بهذا الاسم هو عملية المراقبة الدائمة على المشاركين فيه.في هذه الرواية يثبت جورج أورويل أنه ليس أديباً فذاً فقط, بل يثبت أنه مفكر سياسي حاذق, فهو لم يكتفي بتحليل الفكر الاستبدادي وتحليل طريقة عمله, بل تجاوز ذلك ليتنبأ لنا بنبؤة مستقبلية متكاملة مذهلة لما سوف يؤول إليه هذا الفكر إن استمر حاله على ما هو عليه. هذا النوع من الفكر يستخدم ما يحلو لي تسميته (الداروينية الاستبدادية)؛ فهو بمرور الوقت يتخلص من نقاط ضعفه التي تطيح به عادة, وأيضاً بمرور الوقت يعزّز أوجه قوته كي يكسب أعضاء جديدة يسيطر بها على العامة وعلى الثورات والانقلابات المحتملة؛ فأفكار الأخ الأكبر في هذه الرواية تختلف تماماً عن الأفكار الاستبدادية التقليدية, فهو يتعامل مع الشعارات والهتافات والتسميات بطريقة مختلفة, ويتعامل مع الثوار والمنشقين بطريقة مختلفة, ويتعامل مع طبقات المجتمع والحروب والثروات والتقنية بطريقة مختلفة, بل أنه يفهم فكرة “السلطة” وغايتها وتطبيقها بشكل مختلف, يتعامل الأخ الأكبر مع هذه الأفكار ويفهمها بطريقة جديدة متطورة تضمن له أن يكون نظامه السياسي غير قابل للهزيمة؛ ويبدو لي أننا بقليل من التعديلات نستطيع تحويل الرواية لكتاب من نوع (الطغيان للمبتدئين).في أوشيانيا يستبد الحزب الداخلي بقيادة الأخ الأكبر استبداداً مذهلاً وجباراً على باقي الطبقات؛ فهو يزرع شاشات الرصد في كل مكان؛ وهذه الشاشات مهمتها مراقبة الشعب ونشر الأخبار الملفقة وإصدار الأوامر للأفراد, ويزرع الحزب الميكروفونات في كل مكان لرصد كل همسة من الشعب, بل ويتجاوز الحزب ذلك ويعمد لتحطيم العلاقات الأسرية لإفناء كل ولاء ليس موجه له, ويعمد أيضا لإذلال العملية الجنسية بجعلها مجرد وسيلة لخدمته وبتجريدها من أي رغبة أو وله أو عاطفة كؤاد لأي احتمال لنشوء ولاء لغير الأخ الأكبر. ثم يتفوق الحزب في استبداده على نفسه ليصل لمرحلة الاستبداد العقلي فيسيطر على اللغة, ويدمر, ويعيد تركيب كلماتها, بل ويصنع لغة جديدة, ويمنع الاتصال بالحضارات الأخرى, ويحرّف التاريخ, ويلفّق الماضي, ويقلب الحقائق, حتى تتوه العقول فلا تجد إلا الحزب كحقيقة ثابتة تستطيع أن تؤمن بها.في المشهد الافتتاحي للرواية نرى المواطن “ونستون سميث”, والذي يعمل في وزارة الحقيقة (وزارة الإعلام) والتي, بشكل ساخر, مناطه بتزييف الحقائق, نرى هذا المواطن وهو يدخل غرفته وقد أصابه الإحباط من دكتاتورية الحزب, ومن أسلوب الحياة الذي يفرضه. يفتح حينها دفتر كان قد اشتراه بشكل غير شرعي ليبدأ في تدوين أفكاره؛ وهو مدرك أنه ابتداء من هذه اللحظة قد صار في عداد الموتى, فمجرد عملية التفكير يعتبرها الحزب جريمة تستحق الموت ويسميها “جريمة الفكر”, يكتب ونستون في دفتره أنه يكره الأخ الأكبر, ثم يبدأ التفكير بـ “أوبراين”, وهو أحد أعضاء الحزب الداخلي الذي شعر ونستون أن ولاءه للحزب ليس تاماً, فقد شك ونستون أن أوبراين ينتمي لأخوية شديدة السرية والغموض تعمل ضد الحزب, ثم يفكر بعد ذلك في “غولدشتاين” عدو الحزب الأول, والذي كان أحد أهم أعضائة ولكنه تأمر عليه وحكم عليه بالموت ولكنه استطاع الهرب وأصبح يشكل قلقاً كبيراً للحزب.انتهى ونستون؛ هذه الأفكار المجردة تعني مؤت زؤام مؤكد, لذا لم يعد لديه شيء يخسره, فالمرء في كل الحالات لن يُقتل إلا مرة واحدة ..ومن هنا تبدأ الرواية؛ ويبدأ استعراض القمع والتسلط والطغيان والدكتاتورية والاستبداد, ويبدأ استعراض الريبة والقلق والاضطراب والجزع, الحزب في كل مكان, الحزب في كل فرد, أو كما يقول ونستون: لم يعد هناك مكان آمن سوى سنتيمترات معدودة في الجمجمة.رواية “1984″ كان لها تأثير كبير على روايات عديدة؛ فقد أثرت في رواية “فهرنهايت 451″ لـ “راي برادبوري”, و”الرجل الراكض” لـ “ستيفن كنج”, و “البرتقالة الميكانيكية” لـ “أرثر بيرجس”, ومن جهة أخرى كان لرواية “نحن” للأديب الروسي” يفنجي زامياتين” ورواية “عالم جديد شجاع” لـ “ألدوس هكسلي” تأثيراً كبيراً على جورج أورويل أثناء كتابته لهذه الرواية.أيضاً كان لهذه الرواية تأثير كبير على اللغة الإنجليزية؛ فقد شاع استخدام العديد من المفردات التي ابتكرت في هذه الرواية مثل: (الأخ الأكبر – Big Brother), (الغرفة 101 – Room 101), (شرطة الفكر – Thought police), ( التفكير المزدوج- Doublethink), ( اللغة الجديدة – Newspeak), بل لقد درج استخدم مصطلح (أورويلي – Orwellian) كطريقة لوصف الحالات, أو المشاهد, أو الأفكار, أو طرق التحدث التي تشبه ما جاء في أعمال أورويل عموماً وهذه الرواية خصوصاً.العنوان الأصلي لهذه الرواية كان “أخر رجل في أوروبا” ولكن الناشر اقترح على أورويل تغييره, وبالرغم من المحاولات العديدة لتفسير سبب اختيار أورويل لعام “1984″ بالضبط كي يكون عنواناً للرواية, إلا أنها كلها غير مؤكدة, والاقتناع السائد الذي يُذكر غالباً بهذا الخصوص أن عنوان الرواية هو عكس لأخر رقمين من سنة 1948, وهي السنة التي أتم فيها أورويل كتابة الرواية والتي استغرقت كتابتها ثلاث سنوات بداية من 1945, ونشرت في عام 1949.ترجمت هذه الرواية لـ 62 لغة, وبمناسبة الحديث عن الترجمات فإني أقدم جزيل الشكر للأستاذ “أنور الشامي” لترجمته الرائعة لهذه الرواية.جدير بالذكر أن مجلة “التايم” اختارت هذه الرواية كواحدة من أفضل 100 رواية كتبت بالإنجليزية من عام 1923 وحتى عام 2005, هذا بالرغم من أنها منعت في الكثير من الدول والكثير من المكتبات حين صدورها باعتبارها رواية خطره سياسياً.مما لاشك فيه أن جورج أورويل استوحى الكثير من سمات “الأخ الأكبر” من القائد الثاني للاتحاد السوفيتي “جوزيف ستالين”, واستوحي الكثير من سمات مجتمع “أوشيانيا” من مجتمع “الاتحاد السوفيتي” حينذاك, حتى شخصية المنشق “إيمانويل غولدشتاين” مستوحاة من المثقف الثوري الماركسي “ليون تروتسكي” الذي طرد من الحزب الشيوعي وأبعد عن الاتحاد السوفيتي.اسم “جورج أورويل” الحقيقي هو “أريك أرثر بلير”, ولد في عام 1903 في الهند لأن والده كان يعمل هناك, بقي أورويل هناك حتى عاد – “ذهب” إذا تحرينا الدقة – مع أمه في سن الثامنة عشرة لبريطانيا, وبالرغم من أنه أتم تعليمه العام, وكان أداءه في الامتحانات جيداً, إلا انه لم يرغب بمواصلة تعليمه الجامعي, وفضل أن يذهب للعمل في الشرطة الاستعمارية في الهند, وهو العمل الذي تركه بعد خمس سنوات وعاد لأوروبا, كان مقته للاستعمار البريطاني الذي يعمل له وعشقه للكتابة هما سببا تركه لهذا العمل, وقد قرر عندما عاد لأوروبا أن يعيش حياة الفقراء, وقضى عاماً كاملاً يعيش معهم ويراقبهم, ليكتب بعد ذلك تقريره (متشرداً في لندن وباريس), ومن هنا نفهم سبب تغييره لأسمه؛ فهو يريد التخلص من شخصية الرجل الاستعماري الذي كانه ليصبح جورج أورويل اللاطبقي (أورويل: اسم نهر في الهند قرب المنطقة التي ولد فيها), وفي عام 1936 توجه أورويل لأسبانيا التي كانت تشهد حرباً أهليه كي يعمل كمراسل صحفي فيها, لكنه التحق بالمليشيات المحاربة للفاشية وأصبح يقاتل من أجل الاشتراكية, وتعرض أثناء ذلك لجرح خطير في عنقه, وقد دون خبراته هذه في كتاب (الحنين إلى كاتالونيا), وأثناء الحرب العالمية الثانية عمل كمراسل لمحطة (بي بي سي), وأثناء الحرب أيضاً كتب روايته الرائعة الشهيرة (مزرعة الحيوانات), وفي أخر سنيه كتب روايته “1984″ وتوفي بعد نشرها بأقل من عام في 1950.تم تحويل الرواية لفيلم سينمائي, وقد كان توقيت عرض الفيلم مثير جداً؛ فقد صدر الفيلم في عام 1984, وفي ذلك العام أيضاً أصدرت شركة “Apple” جهازها “ماكنتوش” وروّجت له بإعلان شهير جداً مستوحى من رواية 1984, تظهر فيه شركة IBM”” كأنها “الأخ الأكبر” وهو يتحدث للشعب من على إحدى الشاشات الكبيرة, وتظهر شركة “Apple” كأنها فتاة تجري حاملة مطرقة, والجنود يطاردونها, ثم تحطم الفتاة الشاشة, بعد ذلك يظهر شعار الإعلان, وقد كان: شركة أبل سوف تقدم لكم ماكنتوش وسوف تعرفون لماذا 1984 لن يشبه “1984″.***من مدونتيwww.saudomar.com"
2388,Jenny (Reading Envy),"How have I never written a review for this book until now? I have read this every few years since the beginning of my paranoid education at the age of 11 or 12, when my Dad handed me Animal Farm, shortly followed by 1984.Except I'm not so sure I should call it a paranoid education anymore. How much of 1984 has become descriptive of our current society? Dear NSA, this is for you:
""There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time.... You had to live - did live, from habit that became instinct - in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard....""
*cough*No, I mean, everything is all right, I love Big Brother.We'll be discussing this on SFF Audio, or in Orwell's words, ""in the solemn foolery of a 'discussion group.'"" When that posts, I'll link to it!"
2389,Abdelrahman,one of the best and most painful books I've ever read !
2390,Amex Rijal,"pada 1984 hadir seorang pemberontak: winston smith, si tokoh utama. atau lebih tepatnya sekadar pembangkang. ia menyadari banyak kebohongan yang dibuat oleh penguasanya, dalm hal ini partai, tapi merasa tidak berdaya untuk membuktikan. sehingga yang bisa dilakukannya cuma membenci. membenci dan perasaan tidak nyaman terhadap kondisi pemerintahan –meskipun dengan sembunyi-sembunyi– memang sudah bisa dianggap sebagai usaha perlawanan di saat nada bicara, ekspresi muka, atau igauan saat tidur yang dianggap mencurigakan dapat dijadikan dasar untuk partai melenyapkan seseorang. ada polisi pikiran yang mengawasi lewat teleskrin. teleskrin adalah semacam penyadap yang terpasang di tiap sudut ruangan, bahkan di tempat yang paling privat: toilet.winston terus berusaha memendam ketidak-nyamanannya, sedikit bisa tersalurkan lewat kegiatan menulis yang juga dilakukan sambil sembunyi (beruntung di kamarnya ia menemukan blind-spot teleskrin), sampai kemudian bertemu julia. seorang gadis yang usianya jauh lebih muda darinya, tapi memiliki kecenderungan yang sama: kesadaran bahwa lingkungannya dibangun di atas kebohongan-kebohongan. lewat usaha-usaha tertentu sedemikian hingga mereka bisa merencanakan pertemuan privat, bahkan sampai mengadakan ""ritual"" pembebasan hasrat. untuk selanjutnya banyak ""ritual"" diadakan. mereka menganggapnya sebagai bentuk perlawanan juga, sebab hubungan emosional antara cewek & cowok sangat dibatasi. jelasnya tidak boleh ada cinta di atas kecintaan pada partai. bahkan pasangan menikah haruslah bertujuan untuk mempunyai keturunan demi bakti pada partai.novel ini terbagi menjadi tiga bab. pertama, penggambaran tirani partai penguasa secara umum. kedua, kisah kasih winston & julia. terakhir, yang paling menyeramkan: adegan-adegan penyiksaan winston. ada penyiksaan fisik yang keji dan brutal, seperti yang biasa anda temukan di cerita lain atau film, tapi lebih dari itu semua: disertai penyiksaan pikiran dan psikis. bagaimana winston dibuat sedemikian rupa sampai mengakui dan meyakini bahwa dua tambah dua adalah lima. pengakuan tersebut bukan karena winston kesakitan disiksa lalu menyerah, terpaksa. pikirannya ""diledakkan"" entah dengan alat apa dan setelahnya ia tetap memiliki kesadaran, hanya saja seolah ada serpih yg diambil keluar dari otaknya. hingga ia mati justru dalam kondisi mencintai sumber siksaannya.walaupun ber-setting pemerintahan totaliter, artinya sangat berbeda dengan kondisi sekarang (yang katanya sudah demokratis–bebas), tapi ada beberapa hal mengerikan dalam novel ini yang saya rasa masih terjadi–tentu saja dengan cara/sistem yang lebih canggih. sayangnya saya tidak bisa menjelaskan. barangkali ada baiknya anda membaca novel ini~"
2391,Christian D.  Orr,"This marks the third time I've read this book (previously in 1989 at the age of 14, and again in 2007).One of the most important novels ever written, but also one of the most depressing (though the tone and manner in which the Appendix is written does offer the reader a wee-bitty glimmer of hope). More frighteningly relevant than ever: on the one hand, sure, thankfully, 31 years after ""1984"" was supposed to have taken place (and 67 years after it was actually written), democracy and capitalism still exist, and the Iron Curtain has collapsed; on the other hand, seeing how even in the free-market democracies, Big Government has gotten more and more intrusive into private citizens' lives (see the NSA surveillance scandal in the US, the presence of CCTV cameras on practically every street corner in London, the ability of spy satellites in geosynchronous orbit thousands of miles above the Earth to take close up shots of people and property alike), not to mention any idiot with a camera phone to record your activities and emulate the Junior Spies of Orwell's book, and it becomes readily apparent that the technological potential for a Big Brother-type omnipresent superstate is stronger than ever. The year 1984 may have come and gone, but lovers of civil liberty need to be more vigilant than ever in this day and age, and reading Orwell's book helps to drive that point home."
2392,Ciarra,1984 had me hooked from the very beginning. I am extremely impressed at how the language is so easy to follow and the message of the story relates to people of every generation.

2394,Lucas Deal,"5.0 heartsA book that was certainly before its time. This is what got me so hyped about the whole dystopian genre, although this book is not your typical dystopian because of the sheer gloom factor.The horror and scare factor of this book is not something I was prepared for. I think it hits you the way it does because of how real a lot of this could be. Envision a world where your fearless leaders surmise a totalitarian structure in an ultimately severe way. This is the world that Winston Smith finds himself in. Big Brother is watching You.Every action is controlled by the state. Working, eating, drinking, sleeping, talking, thinking, procreating. You name it, it's controlled. The slightest indication of insubordination can be detected by numerous state mechanisms, which include the ""Thought Police,"" telescreen, and even your own children, who will not falter in betraying you to the authorities. ""Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system."" Language itself is modified in such ways that you cannot express yourself, since individualism is a crime. 2 + 2 = 5, if the government says it is. Any thoughts which are against its Party and any thoughts against the State are regarded as Thoughtcrime. This is really a deep look at Big Brother (which I'm pretty sure Orwell came up with and we still use it today). Again, this book was so far ahead of its time. Take this quote for example. ""Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.""Like a lot of people, I read this too early in my life. I had to re-read it. Many schools have this as required reading. I think its important, but I still think its too early. I wish we could assign reading to adults. You don't appreciate it the right way when you are young because you can't really comprehend all the nuances of life yet.War is peace.Freedom is slavery.Ignorance is strength.We watch this novel unfold, Winston must bow, not only because of Big Brother’s astounding power and existence, but also because of Winston’s inability to arrange any opposing thoughts. Even though he wants to think without restriction, he lacks the discipline and thus the analytical mind to counter O’Brien’s offenses. Ultimately, his mind follows the path of least resistance.""We are the dead. Our only true life is in the future.""This book is one of my all time favorites. You have to check this out."

2396,Ammar,"definitely one of the greatest books i have ever read . A well-written masterpiece with a very noble and very valuebale message : absolute power curropts absolutely , a fiction that is dedicated to the welfare of humanity. The horror and dread of the totalitarian controlling government and the god-like figure of the ( leader ) are conditions i have lived under and so i felt a great deal of familiarity as i was reading through the pages (being brought up in Iraq ) . although the awe of the ( Oceanian ) conditions are exaggerated for the justified purpose of satire and heightening the horror, i believe that the human reactions and behaviours in such conditions are so true-to-life and i believe that this is the main reason for the success of the novel.because we readers could identify ourselves with the humanity in the novel , we could feel Winston Smith's frail body breathing and suffering through the pages and get filled with loathing against and fear from totallitarianism , the intended message or warning reaches home and Hail freedom."
2397,Jose Rangel,Reading this novel was a haunting experience for me. Especially because I live in a country ruled by people who seem going in the same direction as the ruling party in Oceania. I hope I'm mistaken. I really hope so.
2398,Ariadne Divaris,"I think this book deserves more praise then it gets. I was shocked to find it so far down on the top books on Good Reads. If you want to understand the greatness of this book, you need to think about context. Orwell wrote this novel thinking about the future. Even though the 1984 we lived through was not as drastic as the one Orwell imagined, there are elements and themes that are relevant in modern day society. To think of one man creating this dystopian society of the future and to look at the world around us and see brief similarities is equally as impressive as it is scary. On the plot itself, I enjoyed the characters and their narratives quite a lot. The realistic and honest portrayal of love between Julia and Winston reminded a reader like myself about the harsh reality they exist in and the risks they are taking by getting involved with each other. The first person narrative giving us small insights into the time before a long with the extent of Winston's emotions made this book a good and memorable read, and this book will definitely go down as one o my favourites. "
2399,Paulo,Incrível como o livro permanece atual depois de tanto tempo. E o efeito da história é de despedaçar o espírito de qualquer um.
2400,Tarina,"5/5 means i think everyone should read this bookWhere do I begin? More importantly, what do i say that hasn’t already been said before, and better?I guess i should just begin at the beginning and keep going until I come to the end; then stop. The first thing, in that case, would be what I thought of it as a book. I loved it. This book was an emotional roller-coaster; the political activist in me fell in love, the fan-girl in my wanted to cry, the reader in me was a bit confused, and the citizen of a country that looks an awful lot like the state he describes was saddened.One thing I did not like about the book was the sequence of events; that’s right, i don’t like what happened. Not because it did or didn’t go the way i expected but because it don’t make sense. They don’t explain anything, things happen and you don’t know why. And sometimes you don’t know how either. And most of the time it’s hard to even think of a logical reason why or how. Granted I think that was the point, the main character is also just as confused so I think it’s to give us the feeling of terror but ugh. I want to know the why’s.I was, however, satisfied with the ending. I understood why it needed to end the way it did, i understood that there was no other ending. The last sentence of the book had to have been the last sentence. No other outcome would have concluded the story.If you would like to check out my full Chat, which i pulled these paragraphs from you can right here: https://volumeofforgottenlore.wordpre..."

2402,Alex Coman,"""Nineteen Eighty-Four"", by George Orwell*review written immediately after finishing reading*FIRST THOUGHTS: Wow... just wow. I can't even begin to describe how good this book was, in comparison to what I read prior to getting my hands on this!A while back, I met up with my friend Iris, whilst walking through a park with my parents. She said that she had just read ""1984"", to which my father smiled and asked when she'd blackmail me into reading it as well. A couple of years later (i.e.: last month), Iris lent me the book and I've been carefully reading it ever since.(As I've previously done, I started by writing the story of me receiving this book. Just want to mention that I took a two-week break from reading it at some point.)Firstly, here's a picture that perfectly expresses what I've been thinking since I've started reading this book:I mean come on! I'm surely not the only one to notice the striking resemblance this dystopian London bears to contemporary North Korea (I know this for a fact, because this guy wrote a whole article on the matter). Everytime Big Brother was mentioned in the book, Kim Jong-un invaded my thoughts.Secondly, most 1984 reviews I read here on Goodreads bring praise to Orwell's writing style, but what about 
The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism
? That was one of my favorite parts of the book (especially when it is stated that the Ministries were named after the opposite of the actions each one of them does), even if it took me a while to get through it. I was a tad disappointed when finding out who the book's author (i.e.: ""Emmanuel Goldstein"") actually was, though.Thirdly, another good topic that arises when discussing the dystopian novel is the actual existence of Big Brother. From the very beginning, Orwell creates a debate within the reader's mind about the corporality of the ""man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features"". In the third part, there's a flash of hope for receiving a solution to this dilemma, but it goes away as quickly as it comes (I tried so hard not to spoil the third part for new readers...). Therefore, I ask you, readers of this review (hopefully someone WILL read this): What do YOU think? Does Big Brother exist, or is he the Party's made-up poster boy?(Here's a nice map of Orwell's dystopian universe. I never would have imagined someone was kind enough to make this)Some other things that I would like to mention are:1) there are a couple of plot twists that are quite expected (because of Orwell's foreshadowing), but they are perfectly timed;2) the book's appendix (available in my edition, but unavailable through the link provided below) is both interestingly useless and uselessly interesting;3) after reading the Adaptations and derived works section on the book's Wikipedia page, I really feel the need to see Equilibrium and read 1Q84 (by Haruki Murakami);4) there's this quote which has been stuck in my mind for a while now: ""Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood."";5) kudos to Iris for being right about how the third part of the book is the best part (maybe because it's also the most explicit one); it's like the third part is the complete opposite of the first, with the second one being a passageway between them; *awesome*6) I can see how this story can appear to be a love story because of Part 2 and also the last bit of Part 3, when they meet again, but it's not literally a love story - therefore, the production of the 2015 Kristen Stewart movie ""Equals"", which apparently is somehow based on ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"", makes me wonder who allows these people to make movies.~For those who haven't gotten around to reading the book yet, click

2404,Carolyn Evans,"Every human has to read this book. It doesn't matter that it's not the most beautiful writing or that the characters are not fully-realised.It's beyond all 'that' because it forms the basis of any individual's thoughts on how societies are run. It makes you question everything that's fundamental to how we live as human beings today. Its words are the reason we read.If you haven't read it, there's an important connection in your brain that's missing, the one that links you to the truth, the meaning of everything, and yes, number 42. And to all those who think it should be referred to as an essay, rather than a novel: who the heck wants to read an essay?"
2405,Ahmed Taher,"Splendid masterpiece!it's been almost 70 years since this novel was written, yet one can still easily relate to, either you live in any totalitarian country such as a middle eastern one, or in a any capital of the modern world capitalisms. The same game is being played but with different rules!defiantly a five stars!"
2406,Michael Brickey,"Now I know why I've been told to read this book for the past decade of my life. The role the Thought Police plays in the revising, erasing, and blatant manufacturing of history effects me in two ways. First, as a teacher I see semblances of this in our school's history textbooks. Second, as a student of history I am aware of many interpretations of single, historical events. I am thankful for this diversity in interpretation because it reveals that nobody has a monopoly on the past. Imagine if there was only one account of the whole of history. Imagine that this one account was mutable and when edited the prior account never existed. Orwell does this and much more in his fictional dystopia. Throughout the tale the reader is inevitably comparing his own life and society to that of Winston and Oceania. As intended, this book will enable you to fully appreciate all that entails your life as an individual."
2407,Infame Descalzo,"Creo que fue uno de los libros que más me impactó. Literalmente me lo devoré. Me recuerdo leyendo bajo el olivo de mi casa (suena poético, ¿no?). En realidad, fue la primera aproximación hacia lo que es la vida de una persona a la que trata de resistir un lavado de cerebro y finalmente, finalmente. ¡Cómo se puede pudrir la cabeza humana!Todo 1984 precedió a los estudios universitarios de los textos de Hannah Arendt, quien cobró un sentido muy real desde aquel recuerdo de una ficción.Toda la introspección psicológica del personaje, cómo siente que va cayendo, cómo termina, cómo se desmorona todo el pequeño edificio de resistencia que estaba dentro de la mente. ¿Será tan así? Da algo de miedo pensarlo. ¿La mente humana es tan vulnerable?, ¿puede reducirse el lenguaje?.Otro libro que valdría la pena releer. Mucha agua ha corrido bajo del puente (nada menos que una carrera universitaria que se abocó a ese tipo de problemáticas). ¿Qué resultaría de una relectura?, ¿una conversión? Otra cosa que da miedo pensar... pero a la vez estimula. Supongo que todo forma parte de lo movilizante que puede llegar a ser un clásico..."
2408,Eva Shang,"WHOA. I can't wait to ""officially"" read it next year. This is probably the ultimate dystopia story. I literally felt like I was being tortured while reading the torture scene. Even the political philosophy sections were not boring in the slightest because it explained so much about our society now. The thing is, even though this book appears to be describing an exaggerated version of Communist Russia, it actually resembles EVERY country right now. In this technological dystopia set in the future, (but somehow also in the past...), they have this new language forming called ""Newspeak"" where they're cutting all unnecessary words out the language so that people won't commit ""thoughtcrime"" because they won't have the words to express it. Given the reduced vocabulary that I see around me that resorts to using the f-word as adjective, verb, adverb, noun, etc, this doesn't seem too far off. Also, their society persuades the Party members to ""doublethink"", where they realize that something is wrong with the party's philosophy but subconsciously deliberately overlook it and just KNOW that the Party is right, and it's always been right and always will be right.That got me thinking: what if WE are doing ""doublethinking"" and overlooking things wrong with our society because we KNOW that our society is ALWAYS right?(I could be ""vaporized"" for saying that)"
2409,Ali Garawi,"One of the best books i've ever read. I can't talk about any bit of it because i might spoil it. So, i highly recomend reading it especially those who love political theories that started to format between 1850 & 1950. This book is about love, human behaviour, human nature and desiers, politics and a load of brilliant ideas!Do read it! You won't regret it, i assure you. "
2410,Andres Diaz Puerta,"Fascinante lectura sin duda, me atrevería decir que es una lectura necesaria. "
2411,Jwala,"I liked the book not for its story but for the eerie concepts it promotes.The book is superbly organized and the characters are seemingly real. If i had written this book I would have called it "" The negative Utopia"" because of the concepts it promotes like ""freedom is slavery"", ""War is peace"" and ""ignorance is strength"". But the most alarming(or i should say the best) thing about the book is Orwell's ability to convince his readers that such a dreadful world could truly exist. Though the concepts flow brilliantly, the writing style becomes a turn off. I would like to know why is the author so much opposed to the ideas of communism and totalitarian Government. Otherwise I cant believe he could have written such a book. I found it a bit similar to ""Animal Farm"". Finally I say its an intellectual treat to read this book."
2412,janet,"These comment are from my reading of 1984 again in 2013 - 29 years later.For me, this book is a testament to both the strength of the human spirit and a celebration of those who resist tyranny along with the importance of knowing the past, and also of human love and friendship. However, what makes it such an enduringly relevant book is how it explores the limits to which people can be stretched and also the way he created such a convincingly dystopic and comprehensively brutal society. It is apparent to me that this book is the author's expression of his horror at what we witnessed in terms of colonialism and its way of treating the colonial subject as expendable which reminds me of the way he depicts the proles, but also of Stalinism and Hitler which he refers to directly. I just discussed it with a student and what made it wonderful to discuss are all of the things he leaves unanswered as well as the philosophical questions he asks.""He had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave, and it was not much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him"" They also said to each other: ""We are the dead.""This is meaningful because I imagine when people decide to take a stand, they have to accept this possibility.pp. 192-3 state the most important theme for me, but in the book this statement is, if not contradicted, definitely challenged.Finally, I wonder in terms of the world that Orwell created, how anyone is reading this story of Winston's struggle. O'Brien told him that he didn't matter, didn't exist and no one would hear about him. The idea that the story is being told at all might explain the disappointing or tragic ending where Winston says he loves big brother. This could hint at an alternative answer to whether anyone can take over another person's soul."

2414,Olga Shibiko,"Just finished reading '1984' by Orwell. I knew what the book was about and I have heard Big Brother mentioned in the last 20 years in reference to the internet and increasing ability of govnts to monitor it's citizens, but only got around to reading it now. And I think very timely. While the book has many interesting themes I couldn't help but concentrate on the theme of psychological manipulation and draw a parallel to what is going on in Russia today. The propaganda machine has slowly began turning it's wheels about 10 years ago and has finally gained speed in the biggest nationalistic and patriotic movement I have ever witnessed in my lifetime. Winston Smith lives in a society where history and reality are created by the Party. He begins his journey as a disgruntled member who vaguely feels that what is going on is wrong. He begins to take small actions of defiance and as we find out later he is allowed to do so. We watch him seeking evidence that an underground movement exists and joining the 'movement' willingly when it presents itself. When he is finally caught we watch the terrible transformation of defiance to submission to identifying with abuser to the final proclamation of his love for Big Brother. "

2416,Mohammad Al-Shehri,أجدني عاجزا تماما عن كتابة مراجعة لائقة بهذا العمل الضخم.هذا أول عمل أقرأه لجورج أورويل والحقيقة أنه أصبح أحد الكتاب المفضلين لدي الآن.هذا العمل السياسي المتكامل مبهر جدا، وبخاصة الحوارات والتفاصيل المسرودة بعناية وذكاء.أكتفي بهذا القدر من الانبهار وربما إن عدت لإضافة زيادة في المراجعة فسأكتب عنه بهدوء أكثر.شكرا جورج أورويل!
2417,Nema Al-Araby,"This novel is like a political dictionary. The mind of Orwell is just too genius to put in words.The explanation of the slogan was, from my own perspective, the best part in the novel..especially the ""War is Peace"" slogan.Part III was cruel and outrageous, which assured me more and more that I'll never even think about watching the movie, not to mention that i never watch movies after novels anyways.Orwell's writing style didn't strike me as much as his ideas did; to push you to think of a way out for Winston in a totalitarian society, is a thing that could actually drive you insane for a speck of a second.All in all, it's one of the must-read books of, probably, all-time!"
2418,Ali Gilani,"This is a tale about man vs state. And the state is not an ordinary one, it is 'totalitarian' in the complete sense of the word. The state not only controls people and their actions, it controls their minds, it controls thoughts and any untoward thought results in thought crime. However, Winston does commit thought crime, when he starts questioning the Party that rules the state. But they get you, no matter how elusive you are, they get you in the end and crush you. Winston knew this and yet he goes down that line. There is a flicker of hope, and then he meets Julia and dreams of finding the Brotherhood, an underground movement set to overthrow the Party. However, the world is no ordinary world and the Party has found mechanism to stay in power indefinitely, never making the mistake of letting arise any dissent or weakness. It is fortified absolutely. This is a depressing book with ideas so powerful and arguments so impactful, only an intellectual like Orwell could have pulled off. It is no ordinary Sci-fi dystopian novel, it is a shameful depiction of power in all its nakedness, stripped of embellishment. The Party is not stupid, it is not divine, it is unabashed. Total control, longevity in fact infinitude of staying in power even if it means losing humanity, the sense of reality, the past, memories, logic, everything. The end is Power, the means is power. Nothing else matters. "
2419,Noelle Mcconnell,Fantastic book! I read this my senior year in high school and absolutely adored Orwell's creepy view of a future government.

2421,Dennis Littrell,"Orwell, George. 1984 (1949) *****Still relevant as a warningWhen I was an undergraduate it was fashionable to compare and contrast the two famous dystopian novels, 1984 by George Orwell and the earlier Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Orwell was writing in reaction to communism with which he had become disillusioned while Huxley wrote in reaction to eugenics and the classical conditioning ideas derived from Pavlov and the behaviorists.Which novel more realistically predicted the future? Which one gave a better critique of the world at the time of its writing? Which novel was more fun to read? All science fiction is grounded in the present of course and reflects to a lesser or greater degree not only the author's extrapolations from that present but his or her understanding of the world in which we live.Orwell wrote 1984 in 1948. His was not strictly intended as a prediction of any kind but a warning. We thought of it as a prediction though, and in the mid-sixties when I was at UCLA there was a tendency to favor Huxley since 1984 was less than a generation away and it didn't look like the dreary hell of Oceania and the thought police had any chance of materializing that soon. Clearly the feel good, feelie, drug-infused mindlessness of Brave New World was much more likely even if probably much more than a generation away. So we decided Huxley had more realistically predicted the future (great seers that we were). But as to which one gave a better critique of the present, we were in agreement: it was Orwell's 1984. Not that we personally, as privileged members of the great American middle class had been reduced to drinking victory gin and going to rallies for two minutes of hate or had girl friends who were members of the Anti-Sex League. What we knew though was that a football rally, with just a little malevolent direction, could easily turn into a hate rally; and the Big Brother of Oceania was not at all that different in some respects from the Johnson administration that had (we believed) killed Kennedy and was now engaged in a senseless war in Vietnam from which we were spared as long as we maintained our college deferments. Orwell's idea that by reducing the words that one could legally speak, by a government imposed reduction in vocabulary through Newspeak, and by an indoctrination of our thoughts through the enforced concept of ""thoughtcrime,"" and by maintaining a constant state of war from without, the populace could be controlled--this was something that seemed so very true. We had only to witness the relatively recent examples of what had happened in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The twentieth century was indeed the century of totalitarianism, and although it did not seem to affect us now, with flower children in the streets and free love and doobies on our waterbeds, it was clear that the danger was there lurking in the distance.Furthermore we greatly identified with the secret and illegal tryst of Winston and Julia, who like us, stole hours away from Big Brother (actually we stole them away from parental authority) to meet and make forbidden love. But what I think really sold us on the psychological truth of 1984 and shocked us greatly were the rats about Winston's face that forced him to betray the only love of his life and in doing so lose his humanity and whatever smidgin of self-respect he had left. In other words what we saw was the overwhelming power of torture to completely subdue, and as it eventually happened, transform the vital human being into some kind of compliant animal filled with fear and the wretched worship of brute, physical power--humans reduced to defeated creatures glued to the telescreen, smoking government issue cigarettes, drinking government issue gin and cheering government issue soldiers on to the slaughter of distant, hated peoples, while all the while over every vacant space on a wall or billboard was pasted not the Marlboro Man but the face of Big Brother whom the populous had come to love as a beaten dog might love the sadistic human that beats it.As to which novel was more fun to read it was a tossup and depended on your personal choice of genre. Those who preferred horror to fantasy chose 1984. Those who could take some secret delight in soma and free sex and in the security of knowing who you were in the stratification of society, chose Brave New World. A consensus view was that if you were a history or a poli sci major you tended to prefer Orwell's vision; and if you were a psych major, Huxley's.One of the unanswered questions about 1984 is whether it really is possible to reduce the human ability to think by restricting vocabulary and distorting history. If some words are not allowed to exist and if history is constantly erased and rewritten in order to conform to the current party line, is it not true that we will more and more lose our ability to think independently and become more and more like cogs in a great repressive social/political machine?Final thought: what would Orwell have made of the possibilities of the Internet to enslave the populace? --a review by Dennis Littrell"
2422,Chris Quarrella,Better than when I first read it 30 years ago...Orwell had amazing insight into the nature of society....I wonder what he would write if he knew about current technology.
2423,Frahorus,"Capolavoro di fantascienza. Da leggere e rileggere.Orwell, in questo capolavoro, ci presenta la tematica della lotta del singolo contro il suo ambiente opprimente che purtroppo lo destina alla sconfitta (vedi finale). Una storia in cui in ogni riga emerge la lotta di Orwell contro ogni tipo di totalitarismo, quello che lui era andato a combattere e che aveva incontrato. Se nella  Fattoria degli animali  l'autore attaccava al cuore (Ramon!) la politica stalinista, in  1984  egli crea una vera e propria parabola apocalittica delle sue grandi paure (il totalitarismo, la falsificazione e la perdita di memoria storica indotta dai mezzi d'informazione, la corruzione del linguaggio, l'annullamento dell'identità individuale), convogliate in una raggelante descrizione di società del futuro contro cui combatte l'ultimo eroe, ovvero Winston Smith. La storia di 1984 non dobbiamo interpretarla come una visione profetica, ma più come un monito, come un esempio da non seguire. "
2424,Aygun Samadova,"Aygun has a new book in her ""currently reading"" list!"
2425,Sandy Schwisberg,"George Orwell’s 1984 is a frighteningly accurate description of what it would be like to live under a totalitarian government system. To be in a place where you food is rationed, your housing is controlled, and you are fully aware of the fact that the government may very well be watching you at anytime- since are you kept under constant surveillance. Andy if you do not agree with and/or support the ideologies of the Party, then you are taken away to a terrible place and physically tortured until you do. After all, the concept of individualism is strictly forbidden in this society.As preposterous as the idea of such a place as this to exist in reality, the book was written in the late 40s as a response to the actions of the Soviet Union and the Nazi Regime. Orwell pushed Hitler and Stalin’s values to the extreme in order to create his futuristic region of Oceania.Through the first-person experiences of Winston Smith, one of thousands of members of the Outer Party, we can understand what life for an “anarchist” would be in Oceania. The book follows Winston as he commits a series of treasonous acts- such as keeping a diary of falling in love. We witness his struggles in hiding from the government and the Though Police (a judiciary force whose only job is to read your thoughts and apprehend those who are considered to be enemies of the state), until he is finally caught in the end.A lot of this book is very psychological; and deals with the breaking point of the human conscience. In order for the Part to stay in power, they must ensure that the citizens will obey them, so they developed a system in which the majority of the population of Oceania are practically sheep. They follow their government blindly, because they know what will happen to them if they don’t. The scary part is seeing the lengths that they will go to ensure that this mindless zombie state is kept- from horrible torture to the dropping of bombs that may kill a whole black of people in an instant. Such acts are considered to be the norm in this society.Perhaps the most radical part of this story is the passage in which you get to read Goldstein’s book (the book within the book). Inside this book are the reasons how and why society operates- including issues such as the class struggle and keeping the region at a constant state of war. These few pages make up the book that Orwell most likely wanted to write originally. But by presenting his ideas in the form of a fictional novel it allowed for allegorical interpretations that appeal to a much larger reading audience.Or maybe the reason why Orwell decided to write a narrative was because he knew the controversy that would arise over calling it a non-fiction. But even still, many of the ideas that his book expresses are evident in our society even 60 years later- but in small increments. And you would have to be blind to not realise the similarities between the Party and our modern power-thirsty corporations such as Walmart.1984 is without a doubt a revolutionary piece of literature that explores certain aspects of political corruption that most people would choose to ignore. And it’s about time for us to wake up and seriously consider where we want our society to be in the future.“DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER!”"
2426,Alison,This book scared the shit out of me. It's not hard to see why this book is a classic. Am important lesson for us all. 
2427,Mathilde Minà,"Brillante distopia, grande spunto di riflessione. Da anni, ormai, volevo leggere 1984, e non mi sono mai informata sui contenuti (cosa alquanto difficile) per preservare la sorpresa. E così è stato. Sapevo di potermi aspettare il massimo da un libro di tale calibro, e non ne sono rimasta delusa. Ora siamo nel 2015, 67 anni dopo la sua pubblicazione, 31 anni dopo l'ambientazione temporale della storia, eppure i principi che ho intravisto tra le righe sono gli stessi. Seppur in modo più tenue, siamo vittime della società, vittime della strumentalizzazione sia televisiva sia informativa, vittime del potere.Per questo è un libro che verrà letto negli anni a venire: per la sua attualità. Fino a dove può spingersi l'essere umano? Perché è assetato di potere? Non si parla solo di regime totalitario, ma di molto di più: l'annullamento del pensiero dell'uomo, e, di conseguenza, di sé stesso per una società basata di odio finalizzato alla protezione dell'individuo.Tematiche ardue, piene di riflessioni, che inevitabilmente portano ad un'amore incondizionato per Orwell e per queste pagine."
2428,Mustafa Shahbaz,بحكم الطبيعة البيولوجية فان للبشر صفة قطيعية وصفة فردية كل الأنظمة الشمولية لعبت على الصفة الاولى واستفزت الثانية بصورة غير متعمدة .في هذه الرواية يحاول نظام اشتراكي صارم سيطر على بريطانيا في وقت ما يحاول ان يدجن الفرد من اجل الحفاظ على ديمومة النظام بوسائل متنوعة وبتفاصيل لا تترك كبيرة ولا صغيرة في حياة الانسان الا وكرسها -هذا النظام- لصالحه .تظهر الفردانية لدى بطل الرواية تدريجيا ليجد نفسه غريب وسط غرباء يكتشف النظام هذا الاثم ويعيد غسل دماغه ليعود راضيا الى القطيع مرة اخرى.الخلاصة هي ان النظم الشمولية الشيوعية والدينية تبدو متشابهة في النهاية وتسلك نفس السلوك وتنتهي نفس النهاية.
2429,David Lentz," came to 1984 after reading a series of novels by Russian authors about life in Stalingrad during the onslaught by Hitler and then after the cruelty of Stalin. It's easy to see how Orwell extended the grim realities of the concentration camps of Germany and the labor camps of Russia into this dark prophecy. Of course, in many instances his vision has become realized. Big Brother seeks to invade our privacy at every turn via electronic media. Governments pose rhetoric immersed in ""doublespeak"". The Thought Police exist to bully our free expression. Power is exercised by imposing real human suffering upon multitudes. ""The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent."" Oil comes to mind here. And munitions. And diverse other commodities. In 1984 the war is endless. ""Everywhere there is the same pyramidical structure, the same worship of a semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous war."" Sound familiar? The High, or the ""priests of power"" only fall when assaulted by the Middle and usually assisted by the Low classes. Then the Middle becomes the High and oppresses the Low for which change only means a new master. The protagonist, Winston, a ""minority of one"" questions his own sanity but ultimately defends the ""spirit of man"" as a force which cannot be overpowered. In the closing pages we see Orwell's true convictions about the infallible power of Big Brother and the triumph of the human spirit. This dark view has real overtones of Nietzsche and Machiavelli, who wrote with the view of realism based upon the inhumanity they witnessed in their heydays by ""princes"" with the ""will to power"". But the ""spirit of man"" is truly formidable and cannot be overcome, except temporarily, by totalitarian figures and corrupt democracies. The next US national election will be telling about down which road America will travel. 1984 is a cautionary, post-World War II tale but to say it's unrealistically dark and couldn't happen here and now is to overlook eons of history. And to be unconscious of the powers of orthodoxy infringing greedily and corporately upon the spirit of man in our time. "

2435,Līga Vītola,"The first mark of a well-written dystopian work (be it a novel or a Tom Cruise’s latest film) is the plausibility of the created society, the motives and rules behind it. The more appalling, the more undesirable, the more horrid are the acts of the society, yet within the boundaries of the human nature, the more the book is going to appeal to the audience. I understand the  how, I do not understand the  why.The genius of Orwell’s  1984  has not aged since the first publishing of the book, outliving the actual year 1984, and stretching into the 21st century. I do not think that the reason behind the perpetual topicality of this work is our resemblance to Winston or any other of the characters. In my opinion, it is because we believe that 1984 could actually happen - and not because there are technologies to support this kind of ruling, but because the human nature has not changed much. Power is still desirable, violence and manipulation are still the means of seizing this power, and the concept of war has not been abandoned as too inefficient or too destructive. Orwell has certainly created an extreme vision of dystopia - there is not a single hope left after he is finished with his story, and by the end it occurred to me that the ending suits it and I would not want it any other way. What captivated me the most was the precision with witch Orwell discusses language as behaviour control, the meaning of existence and the mutability of the past. It had never occurred to me to doubt the existence of Julius Caesar or Charlemagne. When Winston reflected on how his created comrade Ogilvy was as real as Caesar, I said, almost aloud - no, because Caesar was real! But then I thought - how do I know? Because I read it in a history book. Now that comrade Ogilvy has entered a history book as well, there will be (fictional) children reading about him without doubting his existence. Then what proof do I have of Caesar being alive other than written records? I have no reason not to trust my history book, but the idea remains the same - information could be falsified and distributed easily. In addition, O’Brian’s question whether the past exists was equally terrifying. No, it does not presently exist in any accessible form or dimension, only in memories, diaries, pictures and records. But if we change them, have we changed the past? We cannot change the events that took place, but we also cannot reach them in any way. We can, however, change how we perceive and remember them, and we also can reach these memories. Then, what is past? My dictionary describes ‘past’ as ‘earlier in time’, but time as a device of measuring the duration of events. So, then, ‘past’ are earlier events and, as discussed, we can change how we remember them. It derives that, if every single memory of an event is changed and every single trace of it altered as well, the past is changed. Of course, no one would really undergo such trouble, I hope, but, in theory, it seems possible. That is what Orwell is saying, unimaginable things are possible. And not only with history, but also with the language. Language is thought and thought is language. Have you ever spent a reasonable amount of time listening or reading in a foreign language and then discovered that you  think  in that language? But you are not fluent, only intermediate, or, perhaps elementary learner, and therefore your vocabulary does not allow your thoughts to develop or wander round much. Your thinking is reduced to basic concepts and confusion, resulting from the obstacles - your lack of sufficient amount of words in that language. You would not spend too much time  thinking  in that language but for the sole purpose of learning it, would you? What Orwell is saying in  1984  is that without the proper vocabulary and shades of meaning one is unable to express one’s thoughts, even more, unable to think. And what is a human being without thinking? A labour force easily subjected to control without any hope of rebelling against its enemies. Well, there you go, I have almost written an essay myself. The reason for this is that Orwell gives much food for thought, if you find his philosophical themes being topical and his story equally frightening and plausible. Apparently, I have, and it has lead me to write some of my thoughts down here, and I could only wish to go five or so years back to that day when we discussed this book in out literature class. Now I would make much more use of that class. "
2436,Keleigh,"Rats eating my face. Will. Never. Leave. My. Consciousness.Thanks, George."
2437,Daniel O'Brien,"""1984"" by George Orwell was an awesome book. The entire book kept me on edge the entire time. The idea of the Thought Police constantly watching the people of Oceania and reading how Winsten coped with his difficult life was very interesting. Winsten is constantly battling between the fear of his own thoughts and how the Thought Police would kill him if they ever found out his betraying words and thoughts. So many things that Winsten does could get him in trouble. To try and imagine life with each of my actions being critiqued and watched and it could end up being my death if the Thought Police didn't like it is of course a very in vervains thought so it made this read very interesting. I would definitely recommend this book. "
2438,Lavendersbluegreen,"Just reread this after gosh only knows how many years... because I saw it on a free shelf. Age brings new perspectives and I still have to recommend this one on a regular basis. It shocks me how many young people come into the food bank I work at and just don't read, or only read a very limited amount. Some actually have told me that they thought that Twilight the book was based on the movie.... and so was The Hobbit. Yup, and many others too. There is not a week that goes by that I don't generate a personalized reading list. Sososo many of these kids have not read books that I would have assumed were standard. Argh. So this book invariably makes it onto many of those lists... along with the tempting ""remember this is a banned book"" comment.OI read it at work, on the bus and etc, and because it was an uber busy few days, I actually drew this one out for 2 whole days! What was gratifying were the amount of comments and discussions I had with strangers.Everyone should read this book."
2439,Lily,"It's been 2 years since I read 1984 but I swear I still get a headache thinking about this book. This is the kind of book that still haunts you long after you've finished reading it. It makes even more sense in this century we are living in. It is one of my favorite books I have ever read in my life but it also has to be the best dystopian novel ever written. I remember when I had to put this book down, I was staring at the wall for like 15 minutes doing nothing. It's revolutionary, especially for its time. It has a great plot, strong characters, and the themes are relevant even in the 21st century. As the time passes, I more and more realize that history is changed daily as we watch. Orwell had it right. He was just a little ahead of his time. 
""Big Brother is watching you.""""He who controls the present, controls the past. He who controls the past, controls the future.""“WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH."" 
It still makes me shiver everytime I remember those quotes. Everytime I begin to describe this book, it feels like whatever I say about 1984, it is not going to be enough. It's astonishing how Orwell perfectly predicted the future and how you can relate to it. So just go and read it. It's a visionary masterpiece and Orwell is the king of dystopian literature. "
2440,Edmole,"Loved this, thought the ending was AWESOME. When Winston like rips off his shackles and totally smashes O'Brien in the face and he's all like 'this is MY boot stamping in YOUR face forever!' and then he goes and bones the hell out of Julia who had also totally overpowered her guards by being sexy and ingenious. The last chapter where they have the mexican stand-off between Winston, Big Brother and Goldstein and they BOTH shoot Goldstein and Winston and Big Brother each only have one bullet left each and Big Bro tries to trick Winston into putting his gun down, but he totally works it out and Big Bro is shouting at him ""WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH"" and Winston is just like. ""Ha ha! YOUR ASS IS MINE."" and then he blows him away and he prods the hole he's just blown in his throat and he's like ""Hey, you can do Doublespeak for real now!"".CANNOT WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL."

2443,Meera,"*Not sure if this is a review, or a rant, or just me spilling everything that's on my mind*This is a book that nearly most of my international affairs teachers keep talking about. This is one of the books that you cannot graduate from IR major without hearing about it. I picked this book because this is one of my favourite teacher's favourite novel. Before reading this book, I already had a vague idea about some of the concepts in this book, but I never knew that this book was so scary, and devastating. The scariest part about it is that some of the things in this book apply to our modern time. I have always heard the phrase ""Orwellian society"", but I never exactly knew what it meant only after I read it. Imagine living in a world where you're being constantly monitored, every move, every word, every thought...That's crazy, but unfortunately, we do live in such a world. We are being watched both indirectly and directly. Imagine not being able to have your own thoughts, and your own beliefs. For me, the one thing that I don't want to be stripped off is ""freedom of thought"".The book tells the story of a 30-something guy called ""Winston Smith"", who happens to work in one of the ministries in the Party ""The Ministry of Truth"". His job in that ministry was to alter the past along with the truth, and fabricate them so that they can suit the Party's desires. Winston happened to deviate from the Party's path, and he started to ""THINK"", and thinking was a punishable crime in Oceania. It was a crime so dangerous that you'd get wiped out of existence for doing it. Going against Big Brother wasn't the only thing Winston did, he also fell in love, which was also a crime according to the Party. Within the Party, you could only be with someone else in order to bear children FOR the Party. Winston also kept a journal with him which he used to write in, and this was also considered a crime. The book focuses on totalitarianism, and how it is like living under a totalitarian rule. I have read before that it may refer to Nazi Germany, and Russia under the rule of Stalin. The book is very depressing, but I really loved it. The story is very powerful, and I like the characters. The only thing I hated was the long descriptions in some parts of the book. I thought that since this is a classic, then the language would be a bit difficult to understand, but it was really easy to read (English is not my first language). Obviously, my favourite part would be the last part of the book, especially when he was talking about the ""war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength"". I can say a lot about this book, but I feel like this is enough. Oh, and I liked the concept of 2+2=5, it's really all about what you believe in. For example, Donald Trump claims that he'll make America Great again, I could believe that if I wanted to, just like believing that 2+2=5, however, we all know that Donald Trump will only make America even worse. (sorry for using this example, but this was the only way for me to understand it). 2+2=5, that is true, because I believe that it's true. The thing about beliefs is that they can be changed easily....Quotes I liked from the book:""He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly. The Party does not like such people. One day he will disappear. It is written in his face"" - I like this quote because when you really think of it, nowadays such things happens. There are people who are too smart, they know too much, and what happens to them eventually ? They get wiped out by the CIA for example...""If you loved someone, you loved him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love""""...Some are concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars; others devise larger and larger rocket bombs, more and more powerful explosives, and more and more impenetrable armour-plating; others search for deadlier gases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation go whole continents, or for breeds of disease germs immunised against all possible antibodies; others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water, or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing ship; others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun's rays through lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space, or producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat of the centre of the earth""-This is a passage from page 223 that describes how scientists nowadays are focusing entirely on developing new armaments that can be used in war. I like this passage because it reflects the reality of most powerful countries. We have reached a point in history where every powerful country has a nuclear weapon, or is trying to develop nuclear weapons, and why is that ? it's all for power. Having access to nuclear weapons gives you power over other countries. Now, the real question is, why are they spending huge sums of money on developing weapons that would wipe out humanity ? if these weapons are destructible, it is better not to produce them in the first place, but of course that too is impossible. War generates a lot of money, so why should they stop if it is benefiting them ? At the end of the passage he mentions a technology that generates artificial earthquakes, and just when I read this, I remembered the HAARP machine (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program), which is believed to generate earthquakes and other weather modifications. This was built by the U.S military, and its purpose is to disrupt the communications. I am not sure whether the HAARP machine exists or not, and I don't want to know anything about it. "
2444,Sandra,"A really, really good book. It's a classic and it's weird that I haven't read it sooner. Anyway, it's a negative utopian book about what the world might look like if we let things go too far. It's about dictatorship, not being able to feel, to love, to even be a human. It definitely lets you think about it in depth afterwards. It makes you think if that is the image of the future, if future will look like this. It's really worth reading! "

2446,São Palma,"Um dos livros da minha vida, sem dúvida."
2447,Tyler Willoughby,"This book is truly fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in world views and dystopian societies. 1984 is somewhat of a tough read, with parts that are very long and dry, but it all adds to the overall experience. 1984 is about a dystopia where everybody is constantly being monitored and controlled. The main character is Winston, an old man that has some faint memories of a time before the party's control over the masses. He works at a department that changes the past, rewriting it and destroying any record of things being different. He gets more and more restless of the oppression, and after finding the love of his life, they decide to rebel. Winston and Julia rent an appartment seemingly unknown to anybody, where they have prohibited sex and cook food bought from the black market. They are invited to have a brotherhood meeting by O'Brian, a member of the inner party. After the meeting, he gets a book from O'Brian that explains the way the world works, and how to change it for the better. Winston reads it aloud to Julia, and they are raided by the police. They forgot to look behind an old painting in the apartment. Winston and Julia are taken to the ministry of peace, where they are tortured for what may have been weeks. O'Brian is actually not a part of the secret brotherhood, but a thought police spy. Winston is ultimately remolded to fit the party's ideals. Winston and Julia meet weeks after the events, and tell each other that they sold the other one out. "
2448,Arnab Das,"It's difficult to summarise one's thoughts about a book like 1984. It has influenced generations and has been interpreted by each differently. There have been scores of novels and movies (and even video games, remember Half Life?) which have drawn inspiration directly or indirectly from it. At the outset, it must be said that this dystopian novel is a fantastic read. Even when you ignore the philosophy of it all, simply as a novel this is pretty amazing. Of course, once one delves deeper, there is a thoroughly intriguing and might I add, highly thought provoking, take on modern societies and power regimes and where they're headed. One may not agree with every conclusion the author comes up with but few can dispute the relevance of the book even to this day (the picture of the North Korean defector with a copy of 1984 in the streets of South Korea, ""Nothing to Envy"" by Barbara Demick, immediately comes to mind). Rulers, regimes and governments have since time immemorial been ruthless against the proletariat. And what's extremely uncomfortable and perplexing is the fact that even to this day, around the world, the exploitation of the poorest of the poor is continuing. Somehow we are still stuck with the medieval notions of the higher, middle and lower classes, in one form or the other. And therefore, much to my personal dismay, Orwell's books, especially Animal Farm and 1984 continue to be relevant rather than simply being important works of literature."
2449,Veronica,"Though possibly disturbing to sensitive readers, this book is amazing. It's the first one I read that made me seriously consider issues like underhanded politics, the best and worst types of government, the power of multi-national corporations, and the implications of the deliberately misleading ambiguity of political language. I loved it and hated it because of the truth I found in it. "
2450,Queenie,"""WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH""Words that seem confusing and paradoxical at first, but throughout the novel, George Orwell has you convinced. In 1949, Orwell wrote this novel that predicts the future of our world, and as readers read on, they will discover the resemblance between the horrific, empty and rigid society in the novel with our current society with a chill. The most obvious resemblance would be things such as the shortening and simplifying words and languages (we prob all kno tat) but it is more than that, it is evident that some governments would attempt to reword and hide facts and histories so that it is in their favor, they will do anything to make the citizens believe that life is perfect, if not good, and that the government is absolute. The government and rules built in the novel seems ridiculous at first, but as you read on, you realise how real they can be, how easily a lie may become the truth, and how easily we may lose ourselves, our identity. The novel makes you question the past, value the present and fear the future.This is definitely one of my favourite novels of all times, partly because I am a fan of books about futuristic utopian and dystopian societies but mostly because it has change the way I view our present society, the advancing technology and human knowledge. I believe this book would leave all readers breathless and its words will haunt you, Big brother will haunt you. I am convinced that if Winston Smith, the protagonist who started as a rebel that is guilty of thoughtcrime, can conform and love big brother, anyone else can. Days after reading the novel, I still have certain phrases and passagesIf you are someone who enjoys novels and stories about Utopian and dystopian societies (because really, there is a thin line between the two), this is your book, this is the beginning.

2454,Cristina - Athenae Noctua,"Non c'è da stupirsi se nel 1948, poco tempo dopo un conflitto mondiale che aveva visto scontrarsi i protagonisti dei regimi totalitari europei, George Orwell ha concepito uno dei romanzi per cui risulta maggiormente pertinente la definizione di 'distopico' e il cui titolo risulta da nient'altro che dall'inversione delle ultime due cifre indicanti l'anno in cui l'autore si accinge alla scrittura.Il mondo descritto in questo romanzo è, infatti, allucinato, spersonalizzato, dominato dalla propaganda del partito del Socing, al cui vertice sta il Grande Fratello (storpiatura ormai proverbiale dell'originario Big Brother, che significa 'fratello maggiore'), da un serrato e soffocante controllo sociale e intellettuale, da una rigida suddivisione in classi e da una violenza incontrastabile...http://athenaenoctua2013.blogspot.it/..."
2455,Inigomontoya,"As I'm kinda reevaluating my worldview at the moment, the only thing I can say is, ""Holy crap. That was freaking amazing. Doubleplusgood. "" More to come later, possibly.  Edited 9/21/2015 Alright. Now that I've finished analyzing this book inside out(thanks, English class), I can finally sit down and write this. This was the required summer reading this year, and for once, I was glad. I'd wanted to read this book for a while, so this was a good opportunity. And it freaking blew my mind. Where do I even begin? Winston? The Party? Big Brother? Oceania in general? I could just go on and on about this book. Strangely enough, most of my class hated 1984. I can't even begin to imagine why. Hm...I suppose I'll start with Winston. Winston Smith is the protagonist of this book, and he is a rebel. Or at least tries to be one. (It's a little hard to rebel even the slightest when just making the wrong facial expression can get you arrested and tortured. Or killed.)But he does his best while living in Airstrip One (aka London), in the Party's capital and nearest to the different Ministries. Contrary to his neighbors and coworkers, however, he hates the Party, he hates the war(s) going on, and most of all, he hates Big Brother. (view spoiler)[ Big Brother is the elusive leader of the Party. As much as the members say he is real, we the readers never find out if he actually exists, or if he is just an imaginary figurehead. The latter is most likely.  (hide spoiler)]Anyway, Winston tries to rebel, but fails. (view spoiler)[ He gets caught and is taken to the Ministry of Love, which deals with war, and is tortured until he becomes a loyal citizen of Oceania again. However, he only truly breaks when he is taken to the sinister Room 101. Good for you, Winston. Your life really sucks.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[ As it so happens, the rebellion that Winston tries to join is not even real- it was made up to weed out the traitors that may have been in society. Goldstein, the supposed leader of the rebellion (called the Brotherhood) isn't real, and was only made up to find possible traitors and to give the masses a figure to hate. And the person who led him to the rebellion in the first place, O'Brien, is a member of the Thought Police and captures Winston. Also, his lover Julia betrays him while being tortured. All in all, not a happy time for poor Winston Smith.  (hide spoiler)]This is one of those books that everyone should read at least once in their life, at a time when they'll truly understand the point that Orwell is trying to get across. It's one of those books that will make you step back and reevaluate your worldview, and with what's been happening in the world right now, I'm seeing more and more of this book become reality. Yikes. But beyond themes and analyzing the book, it's just a really good read. The plot was awesome, the characters were actually realistic, and even though it can be very boring in places, it is still interesting. As Orwell says in the book, ""He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past."" "

2458,Vicky,Wow I don't know how to process this book. Scarily how some ideas run true today. It was a haunting and creative look into the future. This book was definitely rich in detail and I would definitely recommend this book! 
2459,Priyam Parashar,"The perfect example that even the most complicated of ideas can be expressed by simplest of words, all you need is clarity of thought. The fact that this book was not a half baked idea but one thought through 'adventure' leaps out of almost every page. The more you understand, the less you mouth off.Unlike majority of the book universes now, this book spans a real meager number of pages in comparison and still sets up a whole world that you can soak in without feeling left out.The whole concept of NewSpeak blew me away. You can see the attachment of the author when once you end the novel and meet the NewSpeak appendix.While building up hopes that individualism (not entirely individualism but couldn't find a better term as of right now) can lead to something big, it kills some part of you at the end. And I guess the best tribute you can give to an artist is when you allow them to control your emotions. And I can honestly say this book broke my heart.Loved the writing style and the whole premises!"

2463,Domenic,"The world of 1984 is a picture of what our life might be. The totalitarianism of the party really kills the people. I can't really imagine if I am in the place of Winston. The lines WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY and IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH are totally baloney. This is really the best classic book I ever read."
2464,Inês,"Before reading it I must confess that I was a bit afraid that the book would be a massive bore. I had this general idea that it was about politics and that's one subject I'm not interested in (even if I should). But I was wrong. The book actually turned out to be about a man that lived in a belic world ruled by the ""Big Brother"", who was always watching. It is, as wikipedia says, a dystopian novel, an allegory I might add. This man, Winston Smith, manages to evade the mind control, being able to distance himself from all the propaganda sorrounding him. He questions the regime, he even tries to fight it. Of course he fails. Even though you know he's doomed since the first sentence, the book is so masterfully written that you get hopeful along the way, rooting for a happy ending that never comes. In 1984, Orwell did not intend to predict how the world would be when that year came, he intended to warn the people of his time that humanity was receding and that fascism could win.About the not so good aspects, I did not appreciate the way women are portrayed in the book. Almost every woman comes off as weak or as a puppet of the movement. Julia was different but still, she was ""only a rebel from the waist down"", having no interest in understanding the ways of the 'Big Brother' and bringing the system down.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book immensely. The last sentence even gave me chills. I won't spoil it. Just go read it for this is a book that will meet your expectations. Even if they are crazy high."

I was wrong. It totally delivered.""More relevant to today that almost any other book that you can think of"" - Jo BrandThis quote is unbelievably true. The book was written decades ago and is set decades ago, yet there is a feel that it could be happening in the past, the present or in the future. It could contain no mention of dates and you would still see the relevance. I've seen a lot of people saying that they ""just didn't get it"" or ""am I missing something?"" and that's fine; not everyone has to feel the same. I did get it though and 1984 was powerful, thought-provoking and frankly frightening.""If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever."" - O'Brien, 1984."

2472,Dave Turner,"A warning and a brilliant price of literature for its own sake.Going into one of most famous book from the last 100 years I had doubts. Books like this, you hear things about even if you wish to avoid any prior knowledge, it's unavoidable. Highly though of, political essays and an pessimistic flavour are three things I usually attempt to avoid in literature, I essentially read books solely for good stories.But. This had that. A fantastic story in an extreme world. The political points made didn't harm the experience, they enhanced it, as they're perhaps more relevant in today's society. The pessimism even formed itself into a beautiful tragedy because of Orwells flowing writing.An essential book to read (if there are any) that I'm glad I didn't have to read back in my school days. This should be something you read because you want to, not because you're told to.DT 27/03/2014"
2473,Jay Salyer,"George Orwell wrote this novel as his health was declining during the final years of his life. His writing reveals noteworthy intensity throughout, and the final product is a great classic of 20th-century dystopian fiction. In fact, this book was one of the first examples of the genre, and remains one of the very best ever written.The horrors faced by the book's protagonist, Winston Smith, are partly of a psychological nature, and partly of a more direct, threatening nature. These include omnipresent government surveillance (something that has become a reality in our own time), and the knowledge that he is engaged in destroying the truth (about past events) on a daily basis, as part of his job. Orwell's depiction of a man trapped in a hellish reality is a stunning accomplishment, and highly recommended to anyone who enjoys dark, well-crafted, intellectually challenging fiction. "
2474,Florin Andrei,"This book scared me when I first read it. Maybe it is my paranoia that the government controls us and nobody realizes it or maybe it is a testament to just how good this book is: the perfect dystopia.Despite this, I think that most people are mistaken in supposing that this book is a criticsm directed at the socialit/communist movement. It just points out to the kind of damage that too large a discrepancy between classes can create. Orwell's novel shows what can happen in any kind of society if the public (the proles) - the people who, in theory shoud have most power simply through the fact that they are many - become distracted by futilities and lose touch with the world around them and the ideas of the people that are in power."
2475,Ingeborg Hodge,"1984 is a very well written book and what I believe to be one of the best books that George Orwell has written in his lifetime besides animal farm, 1984 sets the stage by telling us how the world changed to a place where everything is separated into four groups and all of them are the opposite of what they seem to be for example the peace group is all about violence, love group hatred etc and everyone is under the influence of ""Big Brother"" and they are supposed to love big brother and think only of him or else the thought police will come and make you forgotten.  So as the story goes a man finds a journal and starts to write things he's not supposed to think about and as the story progresses he does a lot of things that are against the rules and he is soon caught and tortured until he finally gives in and shouts something I will not tell you because I already gave to much away but anyways i find this book to bee really good but would only recommend it too people who 1. do not have anger issues because the ending will shock you into anger and 2. that love dystopian novels but either way I say it is a book to read through until the very end and to be read from generations to come. "
2476,Ana ,"Group read for Cocaine Pages!
 Talking to her, he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no gras whatever of what orthodoxy meant. In a way, the world-view of the Party imposed itself most succesfully on people incapable of understanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interestedin public events to notice what was happening. By lack of understanding they remained sane. They simply sallowed everything, and what they swallwed did them no harm, because it left no residue behind, just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird. 
Reading this book has not been the massive experience I thought/hoped it would be. As Tara from my group called it, it was a dry read, not one made more beautiful by literrary effects. But I think that was the point. That was the whole idea. How can you talk beautifully about something so ugly and represent it the same? No, the writing itself must be in theme with what is happening. 1984 is pure, cruel imagery. I don't know if it's just because of my imagination or I'm the only one who felt this, but it's a powerful book no just in terms of “what-could-be”, but also in terms of “what-is”. Not just “what-ifs”, but more like coming to terms with the fact that some of those “what-ifs” are already here. I'm not saying our world is 1984esque. But it's not that far either. It's already started on that slope and if we start going faster and faster, who can guarantee we won't end up like that? Along the book, I met tons and tons of greatly written lines, of thoughts that were also mine, but in different shapes. As Allan Bennett says in  The History Boys  says:  “The best moments in reading are when you come across something - a thought, a feeling, a way of looking at things - which you had thought special and particular to you. And now, here it is, set down by someone else, a person you have never met, someone even who is long dead. And it is as if a hand has come out, and taken yours.” . Here are some of the parts that I really really really really (a thousand really's) liked: 
Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.To die hating them, that was freedom. 
And many, many others... I found this book amazing, and I wish to read it again soon. It's true, it's harsh, it's crude, yes, but it speaks of freedom and love and humanity. So yeah, my kind of book."
2477,Ashley Chen,George Orwell is just a briliant man. This is one of those books that I will re-read. The famous chapter nine was painful but deep. It will cut you open and reveal something that you had thought about before but never truely want to see. Classic!
2478,Phoebe Lynn,One of the best books ever!
2479,Steve,"parallels with modern society are so great, this could soon ( if not already) be classed as non fiction. an exceptional future history, could almost be a manual for that fall of western civilisation."
2480,Rachel Williams,"It is rare that I'm rendered speechless and breathless by a novel. It is even rarer that I find a classic worthy of more accolades than it has received. Eric Blair, under the ubiquitous pseudonym George Orwell, wrote just that.There is much to say about 1984. One could describe at length the unflinching, stark diction of Orwell, or his markedly intuitive ability to pace a story. One could, with great ardor, recount the superb use of ethos Orwell invokes in the reader. Reader, you will find yourself greatly invested in Winston. You will find that walking alongside his wiry, upright frame you will begin to take on the revolutionary's burden he shoulders so humanly. His spirit is not indomitable, nor is his will ironclad or pure or indefatigable. Winston is human, and therefore among the most sympathetic characters I've ever encountered. The hyper-political undertones of 1984 only aid the narrative in fleshing out its portrait of a revolutionary's Sisyphean undertaking.No work of art is without flaw, as the artist cannot reach every pedestrian and tailor his work to the public's liking (especially posthumously to suit the sociopolitical climate). In some instances, 1984 borders on didactic. In others, Orwell's portrayal of Julia, sexist. The former can be met with understanding that the few select pages it pronounces the politics of the book are appropriate. As for Julia's character, not much can be pardoned. Reader, read this novel critically and welcome it for its humanity. Little is contrived and much is viscerally felt upon reading 1984. That is the mark of fiction worthy of its acclaim. I urge you to crack the spin of this book and mark its margins with ink and theories, with comments and observations. Read this before you read it in an academic setting. Experience it unadulterated by worksheets, prompts, and spoon-fed interpretations. "
2481,Isabella Kim,"1984 is a book that is based on Russia's totalitarianism. The main character, Winston Smith, is the citizen of Oceania. He is a member of the party, which rules the land with their own propaganda. Proles, who are the people that are not in the party, are free from them entirely. The party's leader is Big Brother, nobody has seen him, but everyone in the Party has to praise him. Although Winston is a Party member, he still hates Big Brother and always writes in his diary; DOWN BIG BROTHER. One day, he meets a women named Julia. At first, Winston thought she was a police but she was not, and they fall in love. Because all their houses are being watched by the Party, they rent a room in Mr.Charrington's flat and make love there. Everything was going well, until they meet O'Brien and build a relationship with him. At first, Winston and Julia thinks that O'Brien also abhors the party and Big Brother. However, he turns out to be a member of the Party, and so was Mr.Charrington. They both get arrested for a 'thought crime', and go through extreme pain and torture. Finally, their minds get refreshed by the party, and they live on like that. At first, I thought that Julia would be a thought police because she was acting weird. I was really shocked at the ending, when they all got brainwashed. It was a bit scary, but it was also very useful to encounter totalitarianism through a book. I really enjoyed the book, except for the torturing part at the end which really freaked me out. "

2483,Salwa,"In '1984', Orwell paints a bleak picture of a dystopian future under a totalitarian regime that controls all individual thought and action. The narrative follows protagonist Winston Smith who tries to conceal his dissentient thoughts from a government that monitors each and every individual activity. Use of telescreens and concealed microphones to spy on people and the reduction of language to control all thought- it's all relevant to our present times what with the internet and webcams and use of media to control minds. This book is so far-sighted, it's uncanny. I sure got the creeps while reading it! Recommend it as a must-read for all. "
2484,Max Earl,"1984 - Big Brother is Watching	George Orwell’s 1984 is easily one of the best-known allegories written to date, and for good reason. Orwell paints a picture of a dystopian future, a world dominated by Big Brother - an overbearing presence, and ruler of the society. Our protagonist - Winston - is a simple man. Just like any other member of the society, he goes about his daily life in service of the Party. However, Winston is rebellious, and chooses to keep a diary - an illegal act in their society. The rebellious thoughts he writes in his diary make him a target of the thought police, and an enemy of the party. As he grows in his thoughts, and in his feelings for a mysterious woman - Julia - he becomes more and more opposed to the Party’s oppression, and eventually starts to sympathize with the Brotherhood, a mysterious organization that acts against the Party. Even though he knows that the Party is out to get him, and he has no hope of escape, he continues onwards - and becomes tangled in a series of events far beyond his control.	This story proves to be a powerful cautionary tale about the dangers of totalitarianism and manipulation through propaganda. It shows the Party as being completely backwards, as is their slogan: “WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.” The overbearing Big Brother is the ultimate expression of this danger - all seeing, all knowing, posing as a loving protector, but really a cold comfort: a wolf in sheep’s clothing. The citizens can’t think what they want to, can’t love who they want to - merely disagreeing with the Party is punishable by death. This government, this force, is so overpowering to the common man, and works very well with Animal Farm as a denouncement of communism and totalitarianism."
2485,Chris Whybrow,"Orwell's novel remains as potent today as it was when it was first published, and if anything is far more relevant now. The society he presents is a brutal and horrific vision of a Hell escapable only by death.In the world of '1984', there is no respite, no meaning to life and no happiness, not even for the ruling elite. Whole continents are enslaved to, and worship, a dictator who for all they know could have been dead for years and may never have existed. Oceania is a place where no sane person would want to live, and where no sane person could live. Only the government approved fanatical madness is permitted, and any other thoughts are punishable by death. Not that the other two great empires have much to offer either, they are just as cruel and repressive.Through the eyes of the unfortunate Winston Smith, rooted out and trapped by The Party from the very beginning, we see inside the mechanics of a brutal and vile state, designed to become increasingly repressive and cruel over the centuries for no reason whatsoever.What defines this book is a sense of hopelessness. Life in the world Orwell envisages has no meaning or purpose. The Party wants power for its own sake, but gains no joy from it. The war continues, but is never won. And when The Party has successfully indoctrinated a dissident into loving Big Brother, they simply murder them, rendering the whole torturous process obsolete.While such a depressing story is certainly not uplifting to need, it is essential to make sure that a society such as this one never has the chance to exist."
2486,Reinhold,"Der Roman schildert eine künftige Welt, die in drei Machtblöcke gespalten ist, sie gleichen sich in Ihrer politischen Struktur, führen jedoch zur Aufrechterhaltung der innenpolitischen Machtverhältnisse Scheinkriege gegeneinander.Ein Unterdrückungsapparat, der ""Große Bruder"", verhindert jedwede Opposition. ""1984"" ist ein Buch, das die anthropologische Hoffnungslosigkeit geradezu zelebriert und zu einem Abgesang auf die menschliche Zivilisation anstimmt, wie es ihn zuvor nie gegeben hat. Auch wenn inzwischen mehr als 60 Jahre seit der Veröffentlichung von ""1984"" vergangen ist, ist der Roman immer noch aktuell und erschreckend zugleich, noch schlimmer, in unserer heutigen Zeit der Überwachung durch staatlich Geheimdienste und nichtstaatliche Konzerne ist die Existenz des Großen Bruders im Bereich des Möglichen, ja sogar des Wahrscheinlichen gekommen.Man kann nur hoffen, dass genügend Menschen dieses Werk gelesen haben und die Implikationen dessen, was am Horizont erscheint, erkennen... und dagegen rebellieren !"
2487,Armaan Naghdi,"This book was great!!! The action and sexual content got me through the entire book with ease. The way the government isolates all of society has really got me thinking if such a thing could happen in the future. This book creates great scene in your mind when Winston is being tortured. Having not read many distopian pieces of art until this year,I was truly amazed at how much a book like this could create such excitement within oneself even though it is just a written piece of text. I would totally refer this book to a friend who is looking for something new to read and wants to have an adventure within a book."
2488,Alaa Abdul Razzaq,"Finally, I have finished the novel 1984. It took me long to finish it but it was worth it. The ending was, unfortunately, disappointing when Winston wins the war against himself and loves the big brother (this is the ultimate victory to the big brother). Actually I just came up with a new idea which is a mixture between ""1984"" and ""V for vendetta"". I advise to start reading 1984 and when the reader reaches the part where winston gets out of prison to go to the movie ""V for Vendetta"" and continue as if they were the same novel where V is winston and that president is the Big brother !!! You will really feel they were very much relevant with a better ending."
2489,C.A. MacLean,"You’re watching a film or playing a game, or reading a book, and the villain’s motives are laid out. Perhaps they’re the kind of villain who lusts after power and little else, who want to reign at the top of the heap and crush all opposition. We don’t often get to see exactly the kind of world the villain wants to make, other than the supposition that it’s a markedly worse one than what we currently have; invariably, the heroes burst in at the last minute and foil the evil plan, preserving the status quo.1984 is the absolute, quintessential account of the ‘what now?’ after the villain wins.Specifically, this, Orwell’s finest hour as a wordsmith and as a speculative fiction writer, discusses the kind of world that a power-mad villain would create in order to prevent all forms of rebellion and dissent. It is a world where humans have been robbed of the right to the thoughts in their brains, of any form of self-expression (this is a world where music and novels are produced mechanically) of the idea of taking pleasure from even an act as essential as sex, and even of the immutability of objective fact and history. In Orwell’s vision, the world has become a coffin lined with spikes on the inside, so tight and rigid that the slightest lateral movement is punished.In broad strokes, Orwell’s vision has gone from futurist to alternate-history as the implied time-frame of the novel has come and gone, but it retains every bit of potency with which it first was written. Perhaps even moreso, as we can now look back and observe how it foresaw the modern surveillance state.In short, 1984 is the ultimate political dystopia story in any medium. The Inner Party, who exist like barons in servant-tended mansions while all others languish in ratty flats drinking swill, do not have a particular distinct ""flavour"" to their form of oppression: there are no Quarter Quells or Death Stars here. Rather, their stranglehold over media, surveillance, and every other facet of life is so absolute that they need not demonstrate brutal force or pepper the masses with false hope.Rather, they instead are hard at work perverting, suffocating and ultimately destroying the very idea of human communication, creating Newspeak – a linguistic form that trims down language into extremely narrow forms. It is explained in exhaustive (but never boring) detail that, within a few generations, they will have ‘bred out’ even the notion of rebellion through what can only be called linguistic eugenics. Within generations, the concept of rebellion will have been destroyed at its core, because the language will no longer broker the concept. Orwell understands the sublime power of language, of meaning and speech-acts, as much as the theoretical master Saussure himself, here applied to show how these sublime things can serve as a tentpole of an evil empire just as much as a world-destroying space station.So this is why the Inner Party needs not explicitly threaten or make cruel sport to keep the masses in line. (Although, the Ministry of Love, with its Gulag-esque torture chambers, make a strong impression on those who diverge.) No, their game is linguicide, and with it comes the intellicide of all who could make a difference. This is the Inner Party’s grand plan to grind to a halt the gears of human history, which have shown that there will always be those lower in society who rise, and those at the top who fall. This is their endgame to ensure that those at the top never, ever fall.For us writers, 1984 has something very important to teach us: if I might butcher a famous line from another series, a great story is never too long, nor is it too short. It lasts precisely as long as it means to. Orwell’s prose goes on at great length about the principles of Ingsoc (English Socialism, the Evil Empire in this tale), as well as about what it means to rebel in a twisted world where even objective history is mutable and the thoughts in our heads are not granted to us. In most other books, this kind of pacing might be seen as meandering, or (insert horrified scream here) didactic. But it is not, because the ideas being expressed are in this case just as important as the actual movement of the plot. Ironically for a series about a society as suffocated as Airstrip One, Orwell knows how to let his scenes breathe.The actual plot concerns protagonist Winston’s romance with fellow Outer Party member Julia, and their encroaching on the inside of a possible conspiracy to take down the Inner Party from within, to spark a rebellion amongst the downtrodden proletariat. It’s archetypal, yes, but there’s nothing wrong with archetypes. Quite the opposite, really: it’s a tale that’s been told time and time again, these totems of oppression and rebellion, but I think it’s because these stories awaken something fundamental in us, and remind us that there are things worth fighting for, and that there are sides worth choosing.But – without delving into straight-up spoiler territory – things retain a gloomy tone throughout, and what spots of hope you may cling to will soon chime a bitter tone. Even before chunks start hitting the fan, the forbidden lovers regard their own fate as sealed, as corpses marching onward to the grave. They regard any move they make towards liberation as creating only tiny ripples, even if that, which will not amount to waves within their own lifetimes. As they resist the doublethink of the Party – the process of willful hypocrisy that a true Ingsoc believer must submit to – they engage in their own self-deception (or is it?), that of hope in a world where the concept is anathema.Because, after all, this is a world where the traditional definitions of hero and villain in a narrative have been shifted: this is a world where the villain has already emerged triumphant, and it is a reflection of the cruel, unthinkable machines that would be required for the villain to keep their power. Perhaps the cruelest thing to happen to our protagonists here is that – again, no specifics for those who haven’t yet read it – there was no struggle at all at the end of the day, any more than that of a grain of sand struggling against a violent tide. The climactic ‘confrontation’, if it can be called that, is a struggle of minds, of ideologies, but the Party has well and truly thought out its systematic annihilation of the human spirit. It may well be the most ‘successful’ villain in the history of fiction.That is one reason why I choose to view the novel chiefly in this way, rather than chiefly as a critique of Communism or Naziism, as some commenters have said over the years. Rather, it’s a look at the villainous nature of extremism as a whole. All extremes, no matter what ideology originally spurred them on, tend to meet in the middle, where torture and thought-control are the nature of the machine. They all meet in the place where there is no darkness.Incidentally, if you value 1984 as much as I do, you absolutely must check out the film Brazil by Terry Gilliam. To me, it’s Gillian’s finest hour as a filmmaker. While some elements are different, it really does feel like the best major film adaptation of 1984, even if not ""quite"" 1984. Check out the Criterion edition, which includes both the ultimate director’s cut of the film, as well as (for curiosity’s sake) the 90-minute version that the studio butchered in a baffling attempt to make it more palatable to 'the average moviegoer'.As for the novel, I first read 1984 in high school, recommended to me by my teacher when we had a choice of reading material and I found myself unsure. I first read it as a teenager, and most recently read it eight years after that first time, and it has only grown in importance and relevance. I am struck as I read these pages with the impression that I am reading something fundamental, if not to the very progress of our species as a whole, then to the society that we’ve spent the last several centuries building up.Let us as a society always keep the light lit, to never become Airstrip One."

2493,Sebastian Rusu,"It's one of the best books ever written and disturbingly actual even after decades from the first publishing. It's a machiavellic book, a manual of manipulation tactics. The concept of the ""continuous war"" makes me think at the current US policy trying to govern a nation by running unfair wars all over the world just to keep the people in fear. The ""hate hours"" in which everybody has to watch videos with the Nr.1 enemy of the state remembers strangely the current news where any questionable actions of the governement is backed up with threatening videos of Osama bin Laden. The ""rewriting of history"" and the ""double thinking"" is perfectly in line with the current american practice to ""forget"" that the countries he's fighting recently are countries and fractions he supported and made a danger of (Afganistan, Irak) based on the economical and political interests of the moment. Everybody knows that US founded and trained the mujahedeens and Osama in Afganistan but nobody sees openly the contradiction with the actual state of things.Anyway the analogy with US is just an example but the book can be read as an analogy with any disturbed society in disturbed times from Hitler's Germany to Stalin's Russia or Saddam's Irak. It's a great story. "
2494,WangPenny," I think that 1984 by George Orwell is a powerful story. The novel's protagonist, Winston Smith is a citizen of Oceania. Winston is a member of the Party, which rules oceania under the principles of Ingsoc( English Socialism). Oceania is an oligarchy, under hierarchical rule. The party consists of Inner Party members, who are the ruling elite and regular party members, who are citizens of Oceania. Outside of the Party are the proles who are simple people who live in poverty and are free from Party regulations.Everywhere that Winston looks, he sees the face of the Party's leader, only known as Big Brother. Currently, the party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. I recommend this book to anyone who seeks curiosity and imagination. The book details an emotionless world fighting with conformity. The book expresses the fear in people to freely express themselves. There are also many interesting themes included as well as universal ideas explored in the book."
2495,Greg,"A fabulous book from a prophetic voice. I'm sure every generation has thought this book was most appropriate for their time, and I can't disagree, it must be only more so now. Very well written, a deep look (in story form) into governing bodies and personal freedom, or the pretense of. Throughout history and even now, why have small groups of people taken it upon themselves to dominate and control the masses? Do we rely on the government to think for us, to protect us from each other and from ourselves? How far is too far? The inevitable question is, what really is freedom?"
2496,Leo Berggren,This book is not talked about for no reason. When I started readin the book I had formed the opinion that it might be overrated. Now that I have finished the book I can only thank the world that the society that takes place in this book is not a part of our world.A deeply frightening and disturbing book that does not dissapoint as a must read.
2497,Ahmed Abdelbaset,"تعد هذه الرواية من أفضل الروايات التي قرئتها إلى الآن, تتمحور حول الحديث عن حالة الفرد في ظل الأنظمة الإشتراكية الإستبدادية التي تمارس شتى أنواع الرهاب والقمع والكبت على الجماهير وعلى أعضاء الحزب نفسه ومايتخلل ذلك من عمليات تزوير للغة و للحقائق والتاريخ تحت مايسمى حماية الوطن وأيضا خطط الحزب في تحويل العلاقات الأسرية و الحب و عمل إلى أمور غير شخصية خاضعة للمراقبة و التطبيع الواحد, هذا الحزب بقيادة المسمى: الأخ الكبير.. ويصور لنا الكاتب بطل الرواية وينستون المنتمي إلى أعضاء الحزب الخارجي في شتى حالاته الشعورية المختلفة والمتناقضة ومايعتريه من انفصام في الشخصية و شيزوفرينيا مسماة تحت إزدواجية التفكير المطلوب للمحافظة على سلامته وحياته المقتولة الباقية له في غياهب اللامنطق و الحجج الجنونية والذكاء المتقد المرعب الذي يتمتع به أفراد الحزب الداخلي أمثال أوبراين.. ويصور لنا كل أنواع التلاعب في وحيثياتها الكثيرة في سياق أدبي ممتع جدا.. وظل هذا المؤلف مرجعا بسبب جماليته و اتجاهاته السياسية.. هذا الكتاب يقرأ, ومن ثم يقرأ من جديد..

2498,Carmen,George Orwell is a fucking genius
2499,Olga Milemis,"I am struggling with writing a comment about “Nineteen Eighty Four”, not because I have nothing to say regarding it but because only here, in Goodreads, we do have until today 28,140 reviews. Anyway, the first thing I would state is that “Nineteen Eighty Four” is a MUST READ. This is a dystopian novel (written from 1946 to 1948 and published in June 1949) which describes a world of perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, and public manipulation dictated by a political system under the control of the “Party” which seeks power entirely for its own sake and persecutes all individualism and independent thinking. The protagonist of the story is a member of the Party and his job is to rewrite past newspaper articles to adapt the historical record to the current party line. The Prols, biggest part of the population, however notice the controls without big emotions because they can survive in a frame of relative freedom enjoying some gossip and entertainment. The scaring but captivating fact about all this is how many of Orwell’s visions became reality. We are here not talking about technical development but about a society in which absolute control dominates the daily life. I found mind blowing that Orwell forecasted not only the communist and dictatorial systems emerged after the WWII but the control elements used by some actual governments and the statements with which several wars are nowadays justified (“War is Peace”) as well. Politicians who act detached from the wishes of the majority, the surveillance without gap of civil communication through the NSA and much more things about we read in “Nineteen Eighty Four” are already reality. This is a very depressing book which brings one inevitably to the question, how free we actually are. I should say I didn’t find the story itself amazing as a novel but the worth of this book resides mainly in the construction of a vision which already turned reality. "
2500,Elizabeth Moffat,"First of all, I cannot believe it has taken me this long to get to this classic and wonderful novel. But in a strange way, it's kind of wonderful, as I get to discover Orwellian genius for the very first time! The story is set in 1984 (which was the future when it was written), and presents the reader with a new dystopian world where the original Big Brother (no, NOT the television programme!) is supreme high commander and is always watching. We are introduced to our main character Winston, whose job involves editing and updating a multitude of records i.e. newspapers, pamphlets, books, to obliterate traces of a past that ""the Party"" feels necessary, or in some cases, to completely vaporise or re-write history to fit the current line of thinking. In many instances, a particular individual is obliterated from the records if required, so it is as if they have never existed. The remit under Big Brother's control is known as Oceania, and mainly encompasses America and Great Britain. Some other parts of our world are now known as Eurasia and Eastasia, one of which Big Brother is bound to be at war with at some point or another whilst informing their citizens that this has always been the case, even though in truth it has a tendency to chop and change.One of the main objects of the BB party appears to be the creation of mind-controlled, emotionless puppets in its population - this is essential for them to maintain their absolute power. With the implementation of telescreens and microphones in all homes and public places, the Party manages to keep a constant eye on their inhabitants for any signs of dangerous rebellion or indeed thoughts of their own, hence the expression ""Big Brother is watching you."" Faces must remain expressionless while body language is vigorously scrutinised to ensure no ""thought crimes"" are carried out.""Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you. Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.""Any bonds between parent and child, man and man or man and woman are severed before they even connect, to a degree where you may be terrified of your own child as they are actively encouraged to report any deviant parental behaviours. So our hero Winston is in big trouble when he feels himself questioning Big Brother's methods and actions. On meeting Julia, he believes he has found a kindred spirit and they fall in love. But can they escape BB's ever watchful eye?This is such a powerful book, and in my opinion, a work of genius first to devise this terrifying new world, and second to make the pure evil of the Party so gripping, realistic and page-turning, that I couldn't go to sleep until I knew how it ended. I don't want to say too much or give anything away, but I've never read such a brilliant personification of insanity and corruption. Finally, the Afterword where Orwell explores the language of the Party (Newspeak) is truly fascinating and made all the hairs stand up on my arms. Pure and unadulterated genius, this book should be read by everyone, as soon as possible. What's in your Room 101?Please see my full review at http://www.bibliobeth.wordpress.com"
2501,Julie,"Amazingly relevant 64 years later. I've been avoiding this book for decades, and I'm not sure why. This book could easily have been written and published today. Orwell was a visionary."
2502,laurakenji,"E' difficile, almeno per me, parlare di questo libro. In quanto, qualsiasi cosa io dica, non gli renderà mai la giustizia che merita. E' un libro meraviglioso, che ti riempie e ti fa riflettere moltissimo, e per questo vi dico: leggetelo! E, soprattutto, riflettete su quanto leggete perché è agghiacciante, non solo leggere di questa società, ma anche come questo libro (per certi aspetti) possa essere attualizzato alla realtà. Libro consigliatissimo!"
2503,Manuel Matheus,"Debo decir que desde que leí ""Animal Farm"" me convertí en un fanático de Orwell y debo esto a que como Venezolano, no puedo evitar sorprenderme al pensar que como libros ya escritos hace tanto tiempo describan la realidad que vive Venezuela con la implementación del Socialismo (comunismo) del siglo XXl que trajo el régimen de Chávez. Como ya me lo había imaginado, 1984 no fue la excepción al momento de impresionarme.Habiendo dicho esto, me tomo el atrevimiento decir que esta novela debería estar en la categoría de terror, no dejan de sorprenderme las similitudes de la realidad que tienen Oceanía y su población y Venezuela y su población influenciada por la ideología implantada por El Partido en el primer caso y el régimen chavista en el segundo. la represion que hay por parte del Ministerio del Amor, las mentiras por parte del Ministerio de la Abundancia y el ministerio de la Verdad entre otras cosas... O a lo mejor no debería de sorprenderme tanto que Orwell describa tan bien estas realidades porque la historia ya nos ha mostrado esto, recordando el comunismo de Stalin, Mao Tse Tung, los Castro y Chávez entre otros. Definitivamente el comunismo es el mismo donde sea.  Recomiendo este libro como un ""must read"", me ha marcado definitivamente. Y me pregunto, ¿Sabria Orwell que este libro seria usado como un manual de instrucciones? Porque da la impresion de que lo han estado usando de esa manera. Hahahaluego de leer este libro tendre unas cuantas frases dando vueltas por mi cabeza un largo tiempo. ""Aquel que controla el pasado controla el futuro. Aquel que controla el presente controla el pasado""""LA GUERRA ES LA PAZ""""lA EXCLAVITUD ES LA LIBERTAD""""LA IGNORANCIA ES LA FUERZA"""
2504,Julia,"I do not recall having read a novel that delivered such an on-point and direct structure of both plot and words. Extremely well crafted, Nineteen Eight Four is a book like no other in both centralized terror of a potential reality and the total dedication to the creation of a novel with nothing irrelevant ( be it excess words or events). Nineteen Eighty Four is a profound novel. It is also a terrifying observation of an alternative history build on mass oppression, pure ignorance, hypocritical concepts and a world that is fundamentally flawed in every aspect. This is a terrifying novel with a devastating conclusion."
2505,Madge,"It took about 80 pages for me to really get interested in this book, and it was difficult for me to focus while reading it. I'm not sure if it was due to outside distractions or not, but I like to think so, since I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's been on my list of books to read for years, but I finally found the motivation to read it when it was assigned in my college English class. It's a nice change from the ""happy endings"" you typically receive from any story, and the plot is quite though provoking. While reading this book, you can't help but examine the world you currently live in and compare it to the world of the book. It's almost terrifying to see how similar the two are becoming every year. I feel that this book is a must read for everyone, and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a book that does not have a happy ending and for a story that will really make them think."
2506,Ysa Navarro,Horrible.. brilliantly-written. It will rob you of your humanity.
2507,Gianni Costanzi,"Da sempre ne sento parlar bene da amici e finalmente mi sono deciso a leggere questo libro.. anzi capolavoro.. Che dire, Orwell è stato un visionario nella descrizione di questa società distopica.. tantissimi aspetti ci riguardano da vicino.. dal controllo pervasivo di tutte le forme di comunicazione (basti leggere Sotto controllo. Edward Snowden e la sorveglianza di massa di Glenn Greenwald per capire cosa fanno e cosa possono fare con le tecnologie odierne per controllare chiunque). all'esigenza di mantenere conflitti latenti e una situazione di paura (contro nemici talvolta creati da noi stessi) di fronte a cui le persone comuni sono pronte a cedere libertà, di azione e di pensiero (vedi Patrioct Act in USA dopo l'11 Settembre), ad un'oligarchia che principalmente non opera per il bene comune ma per preservare il suo potere. Anche la massima ""Chi controlla il Passato, controlla il Futuro, chi controlla il Presente, controlla il Passato"" è di estrema attualità: lo si vede dai libri di storia, scritti sempre dal punto di vista del vincitore di turno, ai media pronti a distorcere eventi del passato e del presente per compiacere il governo o le lobby del momento (L'Impero invisibile. La vera cospirazione di chi governa il mondo e L'Istituto Tavistock. L'organismo occulto che controlla le nostre menti di Daniel Estulin).Una lettura consigliatissima, anche per i giovani, tanto che sarebbe opportuno leggerla alle scuole superiori, ma creare persone formate e coscienti dei pericoli di un controllo così totale del pensiero, dei media e della società non è sicuramente in cima alla lista delle priorità della scuola odierna."
2508,Tanner Thering,"I didn't realize the first time I read it how much this book sorta cheats. The 1st third is a bit of scene setting, which is fine. The 2nd third is a lot of the plot progression, except for ""the book"" part, which is pure explanation of everything that has happened before hand like it's the stage directions at the beginning of the play, which is weird. Then the third book is essentially an ironic essay written in dialogue. Those are three cool parts to read, so I didn't mind reading it, and thus the five stars, but I get the feeling I would hate this book if I had to read it in one session"
2509,Brandon Peterson,How did it take me so long to read this? Maybe the most disturbing thing I've ever read. Totally amazing.
2510,Adam,"1984 was actually a very good read. I find the way that government uses it’s citizens to be reminiscent of the most feared powers from the past present and frankly the future. Your on a path that goes left or right, on the left is a field of flowers with your family, friends , and other loved ones, and on the right is the government that you know is evil. Using various aspects like fear, language, and violence the government side looks more and more tempting and safe. But there’s something odd you notice on the left side: 2+2=4 and on the right side: 2+2=5. You pick the left and try to stay there and also lead others that way, but the various ways the government uses to hear you (telescreens and thoughtpolice for example) catch you rebelling against government. You know were not at war with anyone, that 2+2 does not equal 5, that government did not invent everything, Big Brother is a hoax, and you remember a time before the “revolution.” But the Ministry of Love using torture and the dreaded “Room 101” makes you give up your loved ones, think government invented everything, Big Brother does not only exist but you love him, and that 2+2 can indeed equal five if need be. So the question remains which way do you go? This is the story that Winston takes around all these obstacles and questions. Very good book glad I read this for school because otherwise I don’t think I would have ever heard of it. 5 out of 5 stars!!!! (that's enough blathering for me today) PS Just as good the second time around."

2512,Eduardo Ortuño,"Many classics are read today because people find some elements in their outdated contexts that are everlasting, like love, coming of age, or revenge. However, as old as 1984 may be, its context seems as relevant as any satirical novel written in the 21st century. Reading the novel at first felt like reading just another dystopian book whose ideas were out of this world. Nevertheless, as the narrator continues to describe Winston Smith's feelings regarding the Party and after we are given a little taste of the Party's intentions, it is not difficult to associate the extreme measures it takes with those that today's governments certainly use. Every part of this book has very interesting elements; the beginning hooks the reader by describing the unbelievable dystopian world in which Winston lives, the middle of the novel gets very exciting as the plot intensifies, and the end makes the reader think, analyze and process the overall meaning of George Orwell's novel. The descriptions and explanations that Orwell uses in 1984 are not boring or excessive; in fact, Orwell's style of writing and of explaining is so interesting that there were many times when I thought that I couldn't agree more with a specific statement. This book is great for readers who enjoy analyzing and critical thinking, which are two characteristics that are of big help when interpreting the hidden meaning of 1984."
2513,Moudi Mubarak.,جورج أورويل؛ كان صديقي في مسافات السفر الطويلة، كانت روايته تمهّد لي طريق الحياة، رواية إنسانيّة بحتة، سياسية_إقتصادية، تتحدث عن الأنظمة الديكتاتورية ومدى بشاعتها.
2514,Shabbeer Hassan,"1984 is one of the most famous dystopias ever written. And with good reason -- this book is incredibly intense. Orwell's picture of the future describes the boot and its stamping of a human face in all the detail necessary to frighten everyone from the pessimistic misanthropes to the idealistic optimists. The book could only be written from the most profound conviction that such a future could indeed happen, a conviction motivated by societies where Big Brother already existed in large part when Orwell wrote the book. But 1984 has become a touchstone of our culture in the way that it functions as a warning. Can we prove the optimist in Orwell correct, and proceed to take the book's warning as a corrective for certain tendencies in our own society? We have survived the bloodiest century in human history without the final annihilation of nuclear war, and without the kind of Big Brother society envisioned by Orwell (although that is debatable).At this point, I would like to say that a self-righteous society that ignores warnings like Orwell's in 1984 frightens me.Political tragedies, such as this, are published constantly, but 1984 is one of the few that has remained timeless and will always be regarded as not only historical, but also prophetic. The book reminds us of what has gone wrong, what can go wrong, and what will go wrong when government becomes all-powerful. It is because of this political and social insight that 1984is one of the best books of all time.And to conclude here are few lines from the novel which always make me shudder in fear or perhaps awe----""Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else,"" says O’Brien. "" . . . In the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth."" "
2515,Ahmed Younis,so u think u have written a fictional story let me tell u you were wrong u have exactly told us what was coming surveillance screens yes we have them in 2014 they r called satellites your country is watching all the world by them the US is watching your country by them any cellphone call is recorded for 319 million person in the US according to NSA which we can call Thought Police plus FBI CIA MI6 a.k.a Love Ministry the torture you mentioned was amazing but after 60 years we have more Guantanamo prison and all kinds of torture never come to your dreams Abu Gharib prison in Iraq the minipicture of Guantanamo and other prisons and prisoner we still don't know where they areThe falsification of history is still here we have Jews telling us the Palestinian land is theirs and some of us is believing like monkeysWeak Of Hatred we also have one but it's one day here called 9/11 where all the world is cursing Isalm for something he didn't commit At last I fu*kin' love your reality man
2516,Ahmed Sobbhy,وصف رائع للمجتمع الشمولي .... تسلم أيدك يا عم جورج
2517,kim McDonald,the book always scares the poo out of me
2518,Rodan,"I was surprised in my second reading of 1984 in that this book is hardly a novel, but more of an essay of the possibilities and eventualities of an end result of a planned socialist society. Government surveillance is merely a tiny (yet necessary) component of the story. It's interesting that someone may rally against their certain issue, say government surveillance, yet simultaneously insist on some other form of controlling other people. Insistence on agreement for the sake of agreement, in all things, is the greater enemy.I don't know why I decided to read (listen to) 1984 at the same time as The Road to Serfdom, but found it interesting that Winston's reading of ""Goldstein's"" book was essentially a reworked copy of The Road to Serfdom. If The Road to Serfdom is the blueprints, 1984 is the hypothetical construction.But now I wonder what Goodreads' aggregator will do to people who have self confessed to reading theses two books in the future. I'm sure they've got a big ol' rat cage ready for my face."
2519,Elliot Cooper,Just as chilling and poignant (maybe moreso) as when I first read it fifteen years ago. The build up is so subtle and gentle that the climax hits like a sledgehammer.

2521,Victoria,"WOOOOOW JUST WOOOOOOHappy re-reading! Reseña pronto****************************Reseña completa en Knocking Books DownEste libro lo leí la primera vez cuando tenía como 13/14 años, lo pedí en la biblioteca del colegio sin saber mucho de este libro. Lo único que sabía era que era libro favorito de un artista con el que estaba fascinada en ese tiempo… jajaj. Lo leí y recuerdo no haber entendido mucho pero sí recuerdo que el libro era muy intimidante y me dejó con una sensación de miedo. En esta re-lectura del libro quedé con la misma sensación. Siendo este libro uno de los precursores del género distópico, creo que es uno de los mejores junto con Fahrenheit 451 y bueno ya es considerado un clásico en la literatura así que eso ya dicta mucho. Tenemos como protagonista a Winston Smith, un hombre ya adulto que vive en un mundo terriblemente aterrador. Leer las circunstancias en las que él vivía me daban mucha rabia, sentía que estaba viviendo con él ahí mismo y me sentía tan frustrada…fue súper loco. Y es que vivir con el Socing, con el Hermano Mayor, teniendo que aprender a hablar nuevalengua, la Habitación 101, y TODOS los Ministerios…¿Quién podría vivir en un mundo así sin volverse loco?Se considera que este libro posee un horror lógico y eso tiene mucho sentido ya que todo dentro de la historia tiene una cierta coherencia. Existen muchas cosas que si uno se las plantea, no es algo tan imposible. Si analizamos la construcción de la nuevalengua veremos que es así. La nuevalengua estaba hecha para disminuir el alcance pensamiento. Por ejemplo, si tenemos las palabras luz y oscuridad, que son antónimos, eliminamos oscuridad pero decimos “noluz” que vendría a significar lo mismo. ¿Para qué tener más palabras en nuestro vocabulario? Para mi gusto, todo en este libro está bien pensado…lo que no le quita el miedo que genera. Este no es un libro para ser feliz, es un libro donde uno puede cuestionarse muchas cosas. El autor se centra y quiere que el lector se centre en los aspectos morales, en el mundo construido más que en otra cosa. El final lo dejará con una sensación extraña (a mi me pasó), tal vez hayan partes que no tengan mucha entretención y que quieran saltárselas pero es al menos un libro que tienen leer en la vida. Yo quedé loca con el final, no me lo esperaba y esas son cosas que se agradecen..."
2522,James Barnard,"Dark, claustrophobic and downright terrifying. This is Orwell’s masterpiece, a novel which has given the world so many concepts and phrases it’s hard to imagine a literary or cultural landscape without it. It feels so familiar it would be easy to start writing it off, claiming that the plot doesn’t really tie together, that the characters don’t behave the way one would want them to, that the global political situation is absurd and that the apparent non-existence of Big Brother as a physical presence undermines The Party. Well, that doesn’t work here.Unfortunately for the future of humanity, Orwell’s points are so logical, well thought-through and ingeniously argued that one can’t help but be convinced that this could easily come to pass. Cameras everywhere? Check. A leader whose face everyone knows but who is complexly inaccessible? Check. Contracting (ie b*stard!s!ng) the language people are allowed to use? Check. Keeping poor people in check by pumping saccharine music into their lives? Check, check, check! We’re not there yet, despite what paranoid people may like to suggest, but the world of Big Brother remains a very distinct possibility.This is far and away the bleakest dystopic novel around. ‘Brave New World’ shows a relatively benign ruling class who control the population by keeping them in a permanently drugged-up state. ‘Fahrenheit-451’ is set in a world where your chances of survival are infinitely greater if you don’t find yourself in possession of a book. ‘Nineteen-Eighty-Four’ takes these motifs, and others, many stages further. Here, it’s not the action so much as an observed subversive *thought* that marks one out for destruction. And while the ruling elites of the aforementioned books, and the other totalitarian regimes of the then-contemporary world, may have started with a genuine desire to make their people’s lives better, and view sustained periods of repression as a regrettable means to an end, The Party make no excuses. In fact, Winston’s interrogator is outraged at any suggestion that their actions are for the people’s own good – the only time he loses his cool in the entire book.A point I hadn’t noticed in previous readings, but which is absolutely crucial, is that there’s no definitive proof that the events of the book even take place in the year of the title. But what can we expect? The Party have managed to systematically erase the past, so no one can be entirely sure where and when they are. Winston Smith may think 1984 is the year, but he’s an unreliable narrator even before we factor in the merciless manipulation of Oceanic society that goes on here. As the book points out, if you can expunge the past, you can control it, and if you control the past you can control the present, and get people to believe anything you want them to. So what if the all-pervading enemy territory keeps shifting? By removing any reference to there being a time when Oceania *wasn’t* at war with one or the other rival bloc, no one can question it, or the reasons behind these shifting alliances.Then there’s the language… This was Orwell’s pet hate, of course – twisting words and phrases so they lose all meaning and can be reshaped to form something else entirely. No surprise that this is The Party’s chosen method of control, and very convincing it is too. Newspeak is a fascinating concept, and while I wouldn’t suggest that this is exactly what our leaders are doing to us, I can’t help but see this approach being taken in this day and age. Unintentionally, of course! But, as Orwell invites us to consider, imagine what would happen if someone did take that and use it as a means of control…This is a work of an immensely high standard. It’s one of the most uncomfortable books ever written, but it really is essential reading. However much we may try to tell ourselves that this is a world that won’t come to pass, Orwell argues his case so well that it feels very real. I don’t like it, but we’re not supposed to like it. I admire it very much indeed though.Genuinely essential reading."
2523,Yanko Tsvetkov,"What I missed while reading this book was a simple smile. It's dead serious from start to finish. I know that's the idea and any sense of humor would have spoiled the terror that it is supposed to depict. And yet I hoped, until the last page, that the mood would brighten up, even for a single moment. Maybe Orwell hoped for the same thing but he couldn't fulfill it. Some stories are bigger than their author and his readers. This is one such story."
2524,سامي بن خلف الوهدان,"رواية جميلة كتبها رجل متمكن جداً أداةً وحبكةً ولغة.فكرة الرواية مبتكرة ورائعة وبسيطة لكنها امتنعت إلا عن عقل هذا الرجل الذكي جورج اورويل !تتميز الرواية بدقة الوصف, والنفاذ إلى مسرح الخيال بسهولة, فكأنك تشاهد لا تقرأ. وميزة هذه الطبعة بالذات بأن الذي ترجمها أجاد أيما إجادة.لابد أن تُقرأ "
2525,Anirudh,"How does one write a book so terrifying and yet so simple? How does one describe terror at its purest form? How does one envision such a complex dystopia where everything seems so natural and real? In his novel 1984, Orwell introduces us to a world where even your thoughts do not belong to you. In his complex and highly intriguing world, terror has a new form. Mind Control. Everything that has been described is so natural and breathtaking. The concept of a thought police, the telescreens watching everyone all the time. The constant alteration of records to change the past completely, concepts of newspeak and doublethink, to think of all this back in 1948 is truly remarkable. What is most terrifying and brilliant about this novel is that it’s based on real life events. The arrests of party leaders who are no longer trusted by the party. (Stalin’s midnight purges) The unperson concept (Again, ideas of USSR under Stalin) The hate speeches (Motivational speeches given in factories) The changing of alliances and alteration of past by destruction of records (Stalin’s agreement with Nazi Germany)The writing itself is brilliant and the concepts ingenious. The novel does not bore you anywhere despite having a complicated narrative and some concepts which need some time to be clearly grasped. The characters (Although very few) are well written and are, along with the plot, the backbone of this novel.Recommended to anyone who loves classics or dystopia. "
2526,Shaima,"""It does not matter whether the war is going well or badly. All that is needed is that a state of war should exist."".To imagine living in war, slavery, and ignorance all of your life.. In this fictional novel, Orwell describes a world that is divided into 3 dominant regions (Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia), but focusing mainly on Oceania, where The Party rules with hate and obsessed with power and control under the supervision of ""The Brotherhood"", where there is no way to scape it or fight it back...The creepy thing is that the novel was published in 1949 imagining the world in 1984, in which the concepts of it also can be noticed nowadays in 2015..Very dystopian, dark, and epic. Regardless of the repetition, it is worth reading. But remember one thing: Big Brother is watching you!"
2527,Kevin Klehr,"There's nothing I can add to what anyone else has ever said about this book. Moving, dark, gripping, frightening and totally plausible.It's not a book I'd read again in a hurry, but it is definately a 'must read before you die' experience. "

En serio, este libro me voló la cabeza, no sólo porque está genialmente escrito, sino por la complejidad de su trama y la dualidad de que la misma sea a la vez increíblemente absurda y totalmente posible. Mientras lo leía no podía evitar pensar en cuánto de ello seríamos y somos capaces de hacer los hombres. Somos el único animal en el planeta que aniquila y destruye a los de su propia especie por el sólo hecho de que puede hacerlo. Incluso hallamos la manera de justificar nuestras acciones como nuestro derecho. Nuestro derecho de ser monstruos. Este libro me hizo reflexionar a la vez que me shockeaba como la re putísima madre! Es un relato sumamente inteligente y escalofriantemente realista acerca de la incesante búsqueda de poder a cualquier costo. El poder como un medio y un fin.Mejores citas:
Hasta que no tengan conciencia de su fuerza, no se rebelarán; y hasta después de haberse rebelado, no serán conscientes. Éste es el problema.
Si la igualdad humana ha de ser evitada para siempre, si los Altos, como los hemos llamado, han de conservar sus puestos de un modo permanente, será imprescindible que el estado mental predominante sea la locura controlada.
Te aplastaremos hasta tal punto que no podrás recobrar tu antigua forma. Te sucederán cosas de las que no te recobrarás aunque vivas mil años. Nunca podrás experimentar de nuevo un sentimiento humano. Todo habrá muerto en tu interior. [...] Estarás hueco. Te vaciaremos y te rellenaremos de... nosotros.
Este es un libro muy inteligente escrito por un hombre que fue probablemente un genio y espero no un profeta... Es un clásico que hay que leer."
2529,Dareen,"Oh wow.. this's a ""Double Plus Good"" book! one of the most terrifying I have ever read, and yet brilliant. ""YOU ARE THE DEAD"" made me literally jump off my seat and throw the book lol. It might be written for year 1984 but somehow I feel it's still valid to these days, with another Big Brother, Inner Party and Room 101. I have to admit that the ending left me feeling somewhat depressed. I'm not into anything political, but I really do appreciate this book. "

2531,A. J. McMahon,"One of the great political novels of the twentieth century, this book tells the story of a totalitarian future in which Big Brother is watching you. The recent Snowden revelations show that the political tendencies identified by Orwell are alive and kicking. I would disagree with a lot of what Orwell has to say, for example, he believes that while we are free to say that two plus two does not equal five, we have not been conquered by Big Brother, and are still free inside ourselves somewhere. This may or may not be so, but Orwell's analysis is always fascinating, deeply troubling and ultimately thought-provoking. A great book."
2532,Lilia Zuhara,"Mindblowing. At first, you'll get bored reading this book. Wait until chapter 17. This book generally describes Orwell's concept about a world where big power is ruling the life of every person involved in the territory of this power. No one can ever escape the big power, even your imagination of escaping is an impossible thing to do. The world, which people perceived as a normal world, could be a big scenario which got twisted every time the power needs to do it in order to maintain the power. This book content amazing concept and explanation of the concept. More amazingly, this kind of world could be the world we live in now."
2533,John Branney,"I first read this book in the 1970s and I really did not get it at the time. The world was much different and I guess I could not see it ever getting to the point that there was one Big Brother and he would spend the time watching us. So much for my naivety.However, after reading the book a second time, I believe Mr. Orwell was off by thirty of forty years. The book should have been called 2014 or 2024. It appears by my math that the world is dangerously close to Mr. Orwell's prediction. Capitalism is now considered by many to be a bad thing while socialism has grown in popularity. Many people have lost their abilities to critically think and spend their wasteful time in social media sites, watching the idiot tube, or playing video games. The government is now entwined in everything we do from healthcare to highways and has been caught spying on people and using the IRS as a bludgeoning club for those who disagree with their politics and policies. Yes, you were right, Mr. Orwell. Remarkably well written, a great classic that I hope is not prophetic. Two thumbs way up. "
2534,Arthur Andraus,"Um livro que me incomodou desde o primeiro dia de leitura até o último. Passei por insônia, devaneios e outras perturbações, mesmo quando não estava lendo. Diferente dos estilos que gosto, 1984 não tem frases belas e bem elaboradas como os textos de Wilde ou García Márquez. A perfeição e o incômodo está em um sentimento pesado carregado pelas ideias, mais do que pelas palavras. Excelente e muito agonizante!"

2536,Sahar Iqbal,"Winston Smith is a clever man trapped in a dull, daunting world filled with tyrannical forces, otherwise known as “Big Brother”. Even upon entering a building, a poster oversees him reading “big brother is watching you” (Orwell, 2). Currently, the area he lives in, known as Oceania, is in war with its counterpart, Eurasia. However, majority of the public does not acknowledge as to why they at war. Winston believes that there is a way out of the system, in totalitarian regime. To his dismay, the “thought” police” follow every word he says and even writes within his journal. Later on within the book, it is revealed that Winston gains feelings for a young woman named Julia but he cannot expose these feelings in the public because according to the government, they are unacceptable. Winston is fed up with the restriction the government has unlawfully imposed upon its people. Winston is part of the Ministry of Truth and desires to break free from the governmental power that holds him back from who he really is. He hears about an organization known as the “Brotherhood”. This excites Winston as he finally feels as if he has found the right people to work with. A man named O’Brien leads Winston on to believe that he is aligning himself with the same beliefs as Winston. However, this is proven false. O’Brian turns out to be a member of the thought police. This meant that everything that Winston has told him, including his romance with Julia is at stake. As a result, Winston is taken in confinement to be tortured. Various cruel acts are done to him. In the end, when Winston loses his last bit of tolerance he realizes that he must “interpose another human being” by which he means blaming it on someone else. He decides to finally screams “do it Julia” (Orwell, 286). In the end, when Winston is sitting by himself, he is fully content with his life and has love for the Party. This is another dystopian theme in which if the government was to put an indivual in confinement, they are able to “get inside you” as Julia as said (Orwell, 290). This is an insight on how an individual’s dignity can be taken away even by a simple statement, just repeated over a few times especially in dire situations like this one. This can be proven true especially at the end of the novel because Julia states that a person is always selfish because whenever a disastrous action is being done to them, “you want it happen to the other person” because at that time, all one cares is about their own wellbeing (Orwell, 292). This book was published in 1949, which was close to the cold war and where communism was under the spotlight. The Western hemisphere, especially regarding Americans, strongly resisted communism. This is because the United States has prided itself of being a representative democracy in which the people are in the “land of the free” and have “free speech” as a natural, human right. Orwell himself is very experienced in writing this book because since he had “witnessed the danger of absolute political authority in an age of advanced technology” by traveling to England and Spain around in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War where he “witnessed firsthand the nightmarish atrocities committed by fascist political regime”. In addition, Orwell was present when Adolf Hitler’s and Joseph’s Stalin of political authority was prevalent which led him to despise it even further (Sparknotes.com/lit/1984/context).With all of this in mind, Orwell was a very credible man in regards of writing a novel that is centered around a tyrannical government.I really did enjoy this book because it was so well written. With every detail of Winton’s thoughts regarding the government, I felt agitated myself. However, I still am curious as to why Oceania is at war since that reason still remains unexplained. I acknowledge that the people do not know but because this was in third person narrative, it would have been helpful to know this information. As a person who enjoys reading about history, Orwell has successfully summarized the majority of the American’s people fear of a tyrannical government. He has successfully exaggerated the idea of how a government can harm its people. However, I am still wondering how the economy worked as well as other political details and how the government was structured. Orwell’s book covered not only political issues but also physiological ones. It was very heart breaking to see how a human can be brainwashed into believing fictions information merely because another person is forcing them to believe it. For example, when Winston is taken into confinement, O’Brien questions him by asking “freedom is freedom to say that two plus two make four” and to that Winston agrees and he is punished for it because O’Brien’s goal is to fully have him brainwashed (Orwell, 249). It makes sense to the reader that this statement is not mathematically logical; however, that fact does not concern the Party. Instead, their goal is just to brainwash the public and for them to “convert” any people who do not conform to their society. Overall, Orwell shows how torture can truly break a person. In addition, one last element that I really sympathized with was when Julia and Winston see each other a month later after confinement and they no longer have feelings towards each other. The torturing and conditioning they both underwent both “broke” them as people. In the beginning of the novel, Winston Smith was a hopeful man, however by the end, he is just another dull being. It puts into question how easily it is to strip someone of their creativity and thinking. It makes me wonder how media in western society can brainwash the public and we could not even know it or even realize it. This book in general puts into question what kind of reality people build and how easily it may be torn down by authority. It highlights how authority only believes those who obey are the only ones who are intelligent and those who rebel are seen as trouble makers. I personally enjoyed this book, although it was tragic at the end. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the Age of Anxiety, history post World War Two, the Cold War, or anyone interested in dystopian societies. "
2537,Carrie,"If I remember correctly, this was my third attempt to read this book in its entirety and I was happy to learn that my critical thinking skills have improved quite a bit since I was 15. This time I did not get stuck at Goldstein's manifesto as I had in the past, but ploughed right through it. I found ""1984"" fascinating and thought-provoking. As I read, I felt simultaneously relieved not to be living in the dystopian world of ""1984,"" and terrified that I am actually living in a more subtle version of that world. When Orwell wrote this novel, it was meant as a critique of Communism, but today many of its concepts (The Thought Police, Big Brother is watching, etc.) seem very of the moment. In fact, it seems like Orwell has written a piece that is timeless in its social and political commentary. I have to admit that this book left me feeling somewhat depressed, but it also left me thinking about it days after I'd finished reading. I would put it in that category of books that everyone should read."

2539,Kristian Keil,"Since this is just another review the use of which is either to criticise or praise this book, I shall make use of this in a more, in my opinion, useful fashion: stating (some of) the arguments that both the 
yaysayers
 and 
naysayers
 use in their (dis)approval of this boringly excellent work of fiction.Those who would gladly die with this book in their hands (the majority) have before them a mighty arsenal of arguments. First off, it is Orwell's great insight and foresight, as it were, for what is to come, whether a quarter of a century after his death or a quarter of a millenium. With unparalleled skill does he, subtly (albeit his way of presenting the backstory is quite ""straightforward""), present what is in store for us, and how our freedom, which we have acquired at so great a cost, will crumble and succumb to the state of semi-slavery as is described in the novel. Orwell lays strong emphasis on the inertness which will come, if we bring ourselves to such a state, and even greater in importance is the reason which will have led us to it - the same inertness. And this is the reason why there are so many advocates of this novel - 1984 is in fact a help guide, a how-to manual. Its use? To instruct us what will take place in case we do what we have grown so fond of doing: nothingOn the other side, the other side of the great acid lake of boiling reviews, we have those who deem this story a bland and unpoetical political babble, which should have been preserved in an academic newspaper rather than disguising itself in the greatest of literary forms - the novel. The prosaic dystopian history of Oceania and Winston's transfiguration and re(de)-transfiguration, are not the elements a ""story"" needs. Though I usually refrain from using reviews and opinions by other reviewers, the best way to describe the utter wrongness of this book is to use Vladimir Nabokov's words: ""A novel has never been so molested and used for other goals than art as it has been done by the horrific ""1984"".My opinion? A breathtaking story of ideas, which is, as it goes with every book out there, wanting in some aspects, but on the whole, I would humbly describe it as...hmmm...the stuff which defines what we are today. Period."

2541,Cara Pulley,"I make a point to read this book every few years and every few years it freaks me out all over again. It's troubling to see aspects of your reality mimicking such an alarming work of fiction.If nothing else, it is a reminder of the value of our freedoms and why our forefathers worked so hard to preserve those freedoms in our country."
2542,Dima ,"This is my second book for Orwell. Well, technically it’s my first book , but I read it years ago and in Arabic so. *مع انه حسيت حالي أول مرة أقرأ الكتاب ناسية كثير شغلات مهمة فيه*. Okay, that’s not why I’m here :Dـــــــــــــــــــــــقرأت حكمة لـ رالف والدو إمرسون مرة، بيقول :"" الكتب هي الآثار الأكثر بقاء على الزمن "" و بناءا على ما سبق فإنه بنقدر نعتبر رواية 1984 أهم الآثار الادبية الموجودة.""I'm sorry I don't know the exact words in English so I had to write it in Arabic, deal with it. :D *Note: This book *as a human being with a mind* you have to read it and reread it and reread it. Such novel should be taught in Arabic schools wallah, but after what happened in Egypt *If it's true or not* they will banned it not teach it. "
2543,Abdullah Adib,"Beware, this is a scary book. Orwell explores the evils man is capable of had totalitarian ideologies succeeded. Unfortunately we see far too many many elements of resemblance with life today, whether you live in CCTV crazed UK or overly censored Saudi. However there is more to this book than just the story. Understanding Orwell's life and the experiences he had as well as the overall feeling at the time helps the reader better understand the 20th century. If you intend to enjoy a good novel or go on quest to decipher the 20th century, this book will be a great companion. "
2544,Mandy,"I've known the story of 1984 my whole life.  For as long as I can remember, my Mum used to tell me about 1984 and how Brave New World by Aldous Huxley was better.  I've always known about Newspeak, Big Brother and thought crime and I watched the film starring John Hurt several times.Strangely enough though, I never read the book up until now.  I guess I believed that because it was a classic, it would be too difficult for me to read.  Well, it is an extremely easy book to read and it is exciting, romantic, interesting and as relevant today as it was in 1949.  This is a timeless, magnificent book but it is really creepy to see that we didn't learn the lessons that Orwell was trying to teach us.For the uninitiated, 1984 is a novel set in a dystopian future where communism spread uncontested across Europe at the end of World War II.  This lead to the development of a totalitarian force governing England and the United States.  The Party controls every aspect of both living and working and party members are watched and kept under constant surveillance at every moment of their days.  The ultimate aim of the Party is to control thoughts and their greatest tool in achieving this is to control reality an memories by altering all written and broadcast materials to suit their propaganda stories.  The population is kept in a state of near squalor with severe rationing continuing far longer than is necessary and relations between people are kept to a minimum.  Sexuality and passion are completely controlled and outlawed.1984 is a true masterpiece and I would certainly recommend that everyone read the book - at least once."
2545,Sorana,"Amazing, amazingly terrifying. The book keeps you in a really tense mood, especially in the third part . A society where thinking is a crime and privacy is a privilege submerges almost all its members to worship a so-said infallible party, led by a ubiquitous figure that is Big Brother. The things that struck me the most were the reshaping of the past and the control that the Party had over the minds of its people. Everybody was living under the impression that what is now has always and will always be, therefore having no element of comparison for their current living standard. The Party was taking care of all the documents that could have proven the existence of a different past, be it a month or even years before the present moment. Controlling the documents and the people's minds, they had complete control over the past, since these two are the only ways in which past events exist.Worse than the Inquisition, the Ingsoc (English Socialism) aims to obtain a complete victory over the so-called political enemies whose worse crime is, usually, thoughtcrime. Not only do they kill them, but they also change their entire way of thinking through various ways of torture, making them finally admit that reality is a subjective thing and it is completely controlled by the Party. I was surprised to find the idea of relativism in Orwell's book and I found it quite fascinating, going beyond the fact that I have no idea if to agree to it or not, or partially agree. Probably the last option.Even if the writing style was not amazing, what mattered were the ideas, the brilliant ideas. War as a way of keeping the population poor enough not to mentally evolve enough to start a revolution, diminishing the number of words from a language as a way of limitating the area of though were equally awesome and mind-changing ideas for me. And the ending, completely hopeless: perfect. I'd have analysed the political implications of the book too, if I had made any clear idea on them, which I obviously didn't."
2546,Siddharth,"Dystopia. Disturbing. I was hardly able to read through the middle chapters of Part 3. It was all so grotesque, the imagery, the man himself, the change his mind was going through, the things a collectivist group is capable of. Ew. If that's the right emotion.Parts 1 and 2 are shocking, hard to believe, fascinating and frightening all at the same time. It's hard to believe that people would exist in a society as the one depicted, but at the same time, it is easy to understand why there is no revolution. When you have no one to compare yourself to, you tend to resign yourself to what you have, take pleasure in the few privileges accorded on you by the power above, the Party, Big Brother.The book by Emmanuel Goldstein is perhaps my favorite part of the book. OR rather, the most logical? I don't know, but it made sense. The explanations, ""War is Peace"" and ""Ignorance is Strength"", these slogans are enraging when in the Part 1 of the book but they make sense in Part 3.The world makes sense once you know why it is the way it is. I had actually planned to read another Dystopian novel, The Man in the High Castle, I am not sure if I would now. Stay away from Dystopia because it is disturbing? Nah, this is probably one of the few books that people read books for."

2549,Michelle (In Libris Veritas),"I apologize ahead of time because I'm almost certain that this review is going to be tough for me to write and probably a little all over the place. First off, this book left me absolutely speechless at the end. Every time I tried to describe it to my boyfriend the only description I could come up with is 'crazy'...which means everything from 'extreme', 'disturbing', 'shocking' and well 'crazy'. It's not written in any sort of fancy way and it's not a masterpiece based on that. I think it's more important how it is written in such a plain way, after all it's partially a warning and needs to be understood. Once you get started you'll find that the words have the ability to sting and stick with you, even though they are plain. I can't say I liked the characters Winston and Julia, especially not Julia, but they represented two sides of the same coin and it was important to see. One was a rebel for personal gain and the other was a rebel who thought of the future. It was also kind of shocking to see how animalistic and yet some how machine like the Outer Party truly was, and completely insane how much power the Party truly wielded over it's ""followers"". I think the most shocking thing to me was that everything in this book seems so...crazy, but not so crazy that it could never be accomplished. To think that this was written 1948 and yet see similarities, no matter how small, to some present day governments makes part of me kind of freeze. A few quotes that really hit me: ""We do not merely destroy our enemies; we change them."" There is something monstrous in changing the enemy only to destroy them, something that can hardly be described. Not only are they going to remove you from this Earth as a being, but they are going to remove 'you' as the person you were. ""Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious."" It's one of those vicious circles that requires immense amount of thought. At first you see that maybe they can never truly be conscious, and then you see that to become conscious is to rebel. Now I'm going to go sit somewhere and take a lot of deep breaths. "
2550,Jonathan,"This is an amazingly prescient novel. When I first read it, I thought it was science fiction - dark, but - a bit like Kafka - utterly compelling. Then, later, I read it again and perceived it as a political satire. Some of it was - in a gallow's humor way - quite amusing, such as when one of the minor characters is asked what he thinks of the disgusting food they are forced to eat and he says ""double-plus good!"" At school I was told it was an indictment of Soviet communism; that 'Big Brother' was Stalin etc. Then, much later, I read '1984' a third time and realized it was about the UK - not Soviet Russia. By then I'd also read more of George Orwell's writings and a little about his life. He was a son of the British Empire. Educated at Eton - a top Ivy League type school - to become an officer in the system that controlled the empire and, after he left school, he went to India to work as a colonial police officer where his experiences made him interested in the system he was serving. '1984' expresses what Orwell spent his life finding out: the spirit, philosophy and methodology behind the British Empire. The reason the book was so prescient is because truth is always prescient. His understanding of how the British Empire worked applies to all empires. You can go back as far as Plato's 'Republic' to see the roots of it. How can a small elite control an empire? Well, in '1984' you see how it's done. Yes, the old Soviet Union did it too. Today, China and the United States are doing it. The European Union is doing it. The government deceit, media propaganda, personality cults, wars, economic state control, paramilitary police, indoctrination of children in schools, demonizing and elimination of dissidents, false flag terrorism, and caste system portrayed in '1984' are present today in how our societies are controlled. George Orwell understood government - what it's afraid of, what it wants, and its methods and strategies. Everyone should read this book and become enlightened about the nature of centralized governments. "

2552,Casper Borly,Cool dystopia.For me the book changed while reading it. From science fiction to a love story to a utopia and ending as a dystopia :)I especially like the idea of doublethink including the fact that the three lines:war is peaceignorance is strengthslavery is freedomactually makes sense!
2553,Mads Kamp,"This is simply one of the best books ever written. I even got my girlfriend, who is not a fan of sci-fi or speculative fiction, to read it and by the end of it she was crying at the injustice and bleakness of it all. She expressed clearly and emotionally what I felt reading it: a want to throw the book away, but an almost magic drawing to the book making me pick it up again and continue reading about the inhumanity and cruelness of Orwell's dystopia. If you haven't read you must! I am convinced that you become a better human being by doing so. "
2554,Mike," This was the first title I read on my new Kindle and the Kindle experience was fine. I added one of the Kindle covers and it's easy to hold and use. I downloaded 1984 from the Kindle store in just a few seconds. I first read 1984 in the early 60s when I was in the 7th or 8th grade. I re-read it in the year 1984 because it struck me as very appropriate at the time. So, this was my 3rd reading and I feel that I saw a lot of things this time that I missed before. I am a fan of science fiction and 1984 is essentially a science fiction story, so it would naturally appeal to me, but it's also much more. This is an extremely well-written novel. Orwell's use of imagery, metaphor, and simile is masterful, giving his descriptions a life of their own which makes the reader really feel what's going on in the story. Winston, Julia, and O'Brien come alive in this story despite being very different from us and living very different lives from ours. Also, the dialog is fascinating: The political interchanges between Winston and O'Brien during Winston's ""rehab"" are so compelling that both sides of the debate can be seen and appreciated (in spite of the underlying scary nature of O'Brien's side). 1984 was published in 1949 and Orwell died just a few months later. Before I read this book the first time I already had a vague idea of what it was about, having already read Animal Farm. Imagine what reaction the first readers in, say, 1950, had. This novel would have had a startling and horrifying effect.  I'm increasing my rating from 4 to 5 stars. Read it again, you'll like it."
2555,Mariella,"I came across this book by reading a tweet from Anonymous, the hacktivist group. It said, ""1984 was a warning, not a fucking guide""I'm going to take this book as the idea that it represents and not how it is 'built'. First of all, it is terrifying. Not the ""holy shit just wet my pants"" kind of scary, but the ""holy mother of jesus this is so damn real"" kind of scary. And I say this because damn it - we've never been far away from being 1984, but we're closer to it each day. A totalitarian society, where WAR IS PEACE (which is kind of accurate now-a-days mind you. We live under the constant threat of a war, we live to be prepared for war, and that my friends, is not peace) because war is the 'normal state', FREEDOM IS SLAVERY and IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH (strength for the party, that is). There is 'thought-crime', meaning thinking against the party. There is the Thought Police, and telescreens that watch and hear you - always. A small twitch or trace of consciousness and you're done for. All that we know is human is constricted so you're just an automaton..... It is a world where it is impossible to have a trace of humanity left or else it will be stripped away from you by psychological manipulation and physical torture. I have come across many reviews about this book saying its just another book fearing for Totalitarism influenced by the cold war, and/or Stalin's form of ruling. But I honestly, honestly believe that more than that, it IS a warning. It is a wake up call, even if we can do nothing to stop it, it's telling us ""hey, be prepared"". I don't mean to sound like a conspiracy-lunatic, but I truly believe this."
2556,Nikita Okhade,"There are some books that make you question your every move, your every need. This book did that for me. With every page that I read, I felt the world that the ""Big Brother"" built in front of my eyes. It is an excellent book in terms of storyline, ideas, writing style, characters and just about everything! The feeling that the author tried to create, the feeling of confinement and bondage was spilling out of every word. The way the scenes are set, the way the conversations occur...brilliant! I absolutely love this book!There is a lot that I have recorded about this book in my journals. The entire journey is a wonderful one. The heartbreak at the end just added to the realism I experienced this book carried. Not a creamy climax, but I didn't need one to love this one. The lyrics of the song that plays in the background when the two leads converse at the end of the book, ""You sold me and I sold you""...I felt it ringing in my ears. Every little thing the author wanted to create was all jumping out of the book for me. Very explicit! I saw it all and I loved it all! "
2557,Avel Deleon,"WAR IS PEACE.FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHNot merely the validity of experience, but the very existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they may be right.""Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.An amazing book. A great account of the future of humanity. George Orwell is a natural fiction writer, with an amazing ability to describe human tragedy. "
2558,Daniel Carbone," I put this novel off way longer than I should have, simply because I remembered not being of a fan of Orwell's, ""Animal Farm"" when I read it in High School. I was also under the impression that this novel would be far too similar to ""Fahrenheit 451"" or ""Brave New World,"" but I was wrong. In fact, ""1984"" is the antithesis to ""Brave New World"" and they should be read back to back.  I found the protagonist of 1984, Winston, to be tiresome and boring and the first 100 pages to be slow and frustrating with expected and contrite visions of a tyrannical socialistic society (no doubt conjured up because of World War II), but once Winston receives ""The Book,"" the novel turns into a fantastic exploration of human consciousness and political influence. The second half of the novel is simply brilliant.  You really have to take into account everything O'Brien says. What is the past but a recollection of memories written down? And those who control the media distributed to the masses--government, the rich--essentially control the past. And those who control the past control the present and the future. Orwell obviously explains his philosophy much better than me. Just read this novel. It is frightening, but it forces you to become a more open-minded person. "
2559,Sahil,"One of the best books I've ever read. Orwell is a genius. A real thinker. Don't read this book for the story or the characters but the subject matter. The author gives a chilling account of a future world where anything and everything is controlled by the govt. The books sort of open your eyes and makes you realise the importance of certain news events that you hear about everyday now - internet freedom, net neutrality, NSA snooping, section 377, Indian IT act. etc. etc. Kudos to Orwell for imagining the future so well. Even though he wrote it for 1984, the book is just as much relevant today and will always continue to be for the future generations. Do yourself a favour and read this masterpiece. "
2560,Kayla,"1984 was a great book. It's a dystopian take on a future with a totalitarian government. The government is a form of communism/capitalism mix, and is busy taking the worst qualities of the both of them. The main character's name is Winston Smith, and he's a decent character. He doesn't have any super complex personality or feelings, and actually, he's a really simple man. He's also kind of a mystery, but I like him nonetheless. He wasn't an annoying character that made me want to tear my eyes out, and because of that fact, he was enjoyable :3The kind of world they're in is very interesting. The book slowly unveils each fact and idea throughout the story, and it's like a castle of building blocks. Each block is being placed down to form the giant mega complex of Big Brother and the Party. Winston works at the Ministry of Truth, which is a giant work building made to formulate the past. Big Brother must always be right, on every wrongful fact and opinion. If Big Brother made a theory two years ago, and it came out wrong, it was Winston's job to go into the past and recreate it.This is what firstly causes Winston's doubt of the party. He knows that nobody can recreate the past. It's not possible to alter the past. The past is the past. But if our memories can only be recorded in physical documentation and in our own minds, Big Brother can change whatever he likes. The story goes on about Winston and his love affair, and his small rebellions to the Party. He believes that something will change, and he dreams about the downfall of Big Brother.This is definitely a book to read. It's a classic that has lived on for years. It's worth checking out. I was not bored at all when reading it for school. It was a little slow at times, but never uninteresting. When it gets slow, push yourself through it, and it all comes out at the end."
2561,Connie," ""BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU""George Orwell saw the oppression of colonialism when he lived in India, and the horror of the Spanish Civil War. Then he witnessed the totalitarian regimes of Hitler and Stalin. This inspired him to write Nineteen Eighty-Four about a totalitarian state that uses surveillance, mind control, perpetual war, rationing, persecution of independent thinking, and changes in the records of the past to control the people under its power.Written in 1948, Orwell's vision of the future in 1984 is an Oceanic police state called Ingsoc which is ruled by Big Brother and the Inner Party. The Outer Party carries out tasks involving propaganda, revising history, creating the language of Newspeak which removes words associated with rebellion and the past, organizing Hate Week, and constant surveillance. The proles are the lowest class who are kept undernourished, uneducated, and do the menial jobs.Winston Smith, an Outer Party member, works in the Ministry of Truth where his job is to revise history. If the past looks like a time of misery and trouble, then the present time under the Party's control looks like an improvement. When Winston rewrites the past to make the Party always look good, he also totally eliminates troublesome people from the records as if they had never been born (unpersons). If the Party tells the people the revised past over and over again through propaganda, it eventually seems like the truth. A party slogan is, ""Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.""A forbidden love relationship develops between Winston and Julia. Julia rebels against the Party for sexual pleasure. Winston is an intellectual, and believes in the freedom of the individual. His thoughts give the reader insight into how the Party establishes control over society. But their rebellions against the Party come with a high personal cost when they are captured by the Thought Police.Orwell created a disturbing vision of the future, and many of his ideas have been seen in governments both before and after the book was published. He was also concerned about how technology would be used in surveillance of individuals. Orwell was brilliant in analyzing the many ways that the state can manipulate individuals and take away their freedoms.___________________________________________I visited the Peabody-Essex Museum in Massachusetts a few years ago. They have a Chinese house from the Mao regime in China. There was a loudspeaker at the house which blared propaganda all day long, and the villagers were not allowed to turn it off. It reminded me of the constant propaganda coming from the telescreens in this book."

2563,Sakura87,"Due più due farà quattro solo finché lo vorremo noiInizio con un’osservazione estemporanea: proprio non capisco perché, al liceo, nella quasi totalità dei casi venga fatto leggere La fattoria degli animali di Orwell, piuttosto che 1984. Credo che sia un libro che tutti gli adolescenti, una delle categorie più tristemente schiave del conformismo, dovrebbero leggere per comprendere l’importanza dell’individualità, della memoria e del pensiero. 1984 è un libro che è come un tremendo schiaffo in pieno volto. Raffigura un mondo in cui il passato non esiste perché può venir modificato a proprio piacimento in qualsiasi momento, senza che rimanga traccia della manomissione. Un mondo in cui tutto può succedere, poiché basta essere convinti di qualcosa perché essa sia reale –e convincere qualcuno di qualcosa è un’operazione estremamente semplice. Un mondo in cui non c’è spazio per il pensiero, il linguaggio è ridotto all’osso perché diminuiscano le categorie della realtà a cui esso si riferisce, in cui ogni momento della vita è monitorato e controllato: qualunque psicoreato vi condanna già a morte. Non esistono leggi scritte, ma qualunque atteggiamento possa condurvi fuori dal gregge vi vale la vaporizzazione: non importa ciò che avete fatto; importa ciò che potreste fare.Orrendo, caustico, spietato, pessimista, eppure terribilmente contemporaneo: un’apocalisse spaventosamente reale vista l’evoluzione della tecnologia e la manipolazione continua dei media, nonché il grado d’ignoranza e di conformità degli attuali prolet. Un libro che invita a guardarsi dal potere e dai suoi pericoli, che sottolinea l’importanza del passato, delle impressioni del presente e del futuro. Un libro che non dovrebbe mancare in nessun caso."
2564,Annabel Lee,"This probably one of the best books I've read, and also one with the scariest message. The fact that Winston becomes compliant to Big Brother at the end made it even scarier. Fear can take you over, and can also be manipulated by others. This book is amazing because it clearly shows that you can turn against you love (view spoiler)[like when Winston turned against Julia in Room 101 torture chamber (hide spoiler)] if the opposing party knows what irks you. Good job George Orwell. What an amazing book."

Back in the days you did not have many of those kind of stories. Now , especially after The Hunger Games, although that series was definitely not the first of that genre, as some have you believe ;) But it became a hype and there are so many A dystopian series now.This is a standalone book and it pictures a world where everyone lives in fear of Big brother. Yo know you are always watched. I highly recommend this, especially to younger readers! Great read."
2567,Yasmin,"""To consciously induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed."" A general definition of ""doublethink"", one of the multiple ingenious neologies Orwell created to name the strategies and principles needed to create and sustain the ultimate dystopia.Like all fictional dystopias, this was, to an unrealistic extent, very relatable to our real world and awakens the sense of rebellion in you, but unlike the other dystopias, this went down the core and reason of rebellion to find a ""cure"" for it.That of course, as would be expected, roamed around bringing the human down as close as possible to the animal. The way he talked about how to achieve that blew my mind especially the concept of thought and how to limit it by limiting the language.And then came alterable past and the definition of facts and realism and power.Mind-blowing ingeniousness is what I can shortly describe this novel with.You know it's fictional, but this novel's ending gets you doubting how much fiction is in it truly. In fiction the rebellious nature of a human is always victorious, but this novel gets you thinking, ""If placed through what Winston's been through, would this rebellious nature still win?""Orwell left the ending of the novel to be reflected upon by each reader's true nature; the reader's nature is what decides the ending, and then of course there is Eric Blair's own nature that will decide an ending that, I guess, we would never know."
2568,Jessica O'Toole,"This is one of my all-time favourite books, and I think it's hard to add to perpetual praise for its existence, especially since its inception was barely beyond WWII.Its bleakness and desolation has not left me since I first read it, and each time I revisit it it seems more and more astonishing. Reviews about blandness of character are certainly correct on one level - is a dystopic novel about the removal of humanity's connection to each other and our history. Where do you get vibrancy of personality with nothing to feed off? A tiny shimmer of emotion in that world comes out as ""I love you"". Orwell knew very well what he was doing.It is that layer which gives 1984 such bleakness. Any thought of hope or love or anything else outlawed is only allowed to exist because Big Brother allows it. There is no beating the system, there is no possible rebellion, and ultimately, though it feels like it, to me the book isn't about a man yearning to fight his way to a glimmer of freedom and almost touching it, but more a man learning it does not exist, and it never did. There are no happy endings. Happiness has been deleted. Disney be damned!"
2569,Solor,"The great author develops obvious influences from previous dystopian works (notable We,Brave New World) of fictional totalitarian state founded on mind control through Education, Propaganda and Social Engineering in a fluid and gripping narrative.Orwell novel deals with profound metaphysical arguments in a powerful way: Nature of Reality, Solipsism and most importantly Language as identity and limit of our consciousness. His masterstroke is the invention of Newspeak, a deliberately impoverished language promoted by the state which aims at destroying unorthodox, redundant and abstract meanings in order to establish a firm thought control system. ""Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever be needed will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten."" (1.5.23, Syme) "
2570,Knaque Trasvach,"Mungkin ending yang seperti itu lebih cocok dengan cerita tapiSaya belajar banyak dari 1984. Politiknya, mamen... Politik ini sungguhan dipakai di era rezim Soeharto dan ada beberapa yang digunakan lagi oleh partai tertentu. 1984 ini perwujudan dari kalimat Alan Moore tentang fiksi menyampaikan kebenaran. Dan memang menyampaikan kebenaranlah fiksi ini sehingga ia akhirnya menjadi buku pedoman penulisan politik atau pemerintah di genre dystopia. Bahkan jadi pedoman untuk orang di lingkaran dalam S., kayaknya.Ide Orwell sinting dan sintingnya tak lekang oleh waktu. Hasil observasi yang sungguh baik dari mata yang begitu peka. Hasilnya juga sangat baik. Emosi campur aduk, pemahaman tentang manusia, dan semacam prediksi masa depan. Orang sinting. Dan tulisan sinting yang bikin sedih sampai sesaat kembali jadi misanthrope. lolKalau ada yang menyebut ceritanya kurang dalam dan ga bagus, saya kira masih bagus karena karakterisasi masing-masing jelas. Dan dampak dari cuci otak itu juga masuk akal, imho.Hal lain yang diperoleh dari kitab (yes, kitab) ini: individu tak akan menang melawan sistem. Hanya sistem yang bisa mengalahkan sesama sistem."

2574,Johnny,"I escaped high school and college having never read any George Orwell and having just finished 1984 I understand what a tragedy that is! This novel is totally brilliant, especially given the time period in which it was written. Orwell’s ability to see with utter clarity the mad power grab of those in power as they strive to maintain the hierarchical nature of Western society is something I never (and perhaps this is a fault of my own deficiencies of history and philosophical thought) considered to be as keenly focused it is presented within this book.I see so much of what Orwell details in this futuristic dystopia that is London in 1984 as part of our current political establishment in America. When Winston is given the book by The Brotherhood, he reads Emmanuel Goldstein’s dissertation on the power structure of the “oligarchical collectivism” that exists in his world. As Big Brother’s archenemy, Goldstein lays out for would-be activists the how and the why the Party maintains order and it reads (admittedly a bit didactically) almost as a manual for the powers that be of the read world today. He claims that “if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realise that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.” While this thought might be a bit radical, I really feel that many politicians, especially those on the right subconsciously suppress social programs to maintain the balance of power in their own favors. Goldstein’s thoughts on war or similarly prophetic: “The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed.” In his book, he makes the argument to his readers that war in particular feeds the need to keep the lower levels of social hierarchies from achieving a comfort of living that would afford them time to consider their country’s leadership while also taking an emotional toll on the people, provoking fear and patriotism. In the context of the novel of course, this knowledge eventually wreaks havoc on Winston’s own attempts to rebel and the accuracy of the very existence of Goldstein is called into question, leaving Winston and the reader to wonder if the rumors of rebellion that are characterized by the elusive Brotherhood are merely another tactic of Big Brother in controlling the masses, particularly those intellectuals like Winston.So much of the book reads as though it were written in response to today’s world and not the world of the mid-twentieth century; however elements of it are clearly dated. Orwell’s pre-sexual revolution male perspective comes through slightly in his depiction of Winston’s lover Julia, a much younger woman who wants nothing more than a sexual relationship with Winston. It is not until he sees her with “just a few dabs of colour [make up:] in the right places” that he discovers she is “not only very much prettier, but above all, far more feminine.” Julia not only represents the dated male fantasy of the oversexed younger woman who is madly in love with the man beginning his midlife crisis though. Orwell sets up the age difference to also brilliantly bring into the play the varying attitudes of different generations to political oppression. Julia is only concerned about subverting Big Brother and the Party in so much as it effects her own pleasure. She could not care less about playing a role in a larger and longer political movement, whereas Winston understands that he will likely never live to see the day that the masses overthrow Big Brother and is still willing to play his part. Winston idyllically tells her that he “can imagine little knots of resistance springing up here and there—small groups of people banding themselves together, and gradually growing, and even leaving a few records behind, so that the generation can carry on where we leave off,” to which Julia responds, “I’m not interested in the next generation dear. I’m interested in us,” clearly representing the voice of egocentric adolescence and early adulthood. Winston reacts with an objectifying and biting comment that she is “only a rebel from the waist downwards,” again displaying some of the misogyny that creeps into the novel from time to time, perhaps even deliberately on Orwell’s part.In 1984, Orwell creates a brilliant depiction of an oppressive society that seems far too realistic to be true fiction, something we should all be wary of even as we move further and further away from the actual 1984!"
2575,Igor,Superb.
2576,Gustavo Obregon,"...dystopian themes usually leave many loose ends but 1984 breaks that rule.The story focuses on Winston Smith, a 39 year old lonely government worker who questions the system and feels he must rebel against it but doesn't know quite how to. Winston eventually finds some allies but things don't exactly end as the reader would want. The supposed existence of ""The Brotherhood"", a secret group that plans on bringing down Big Brother's government system reveals a book that sums up the entire concept of the book.It would be foolish to judge a book great-in-concept book like 1984. This is a really true classic, even better than Animal Farm. "
2577,Charlotte Coldwell,"1984 by George Orwell really is the dystopian book, to which all modern ones should bow down towards. It does what, in my mind, a dystopian book should do, which is terrify the reader out of their wits. For if it does this, it has convinced them that the possibility of this happening isn't completely fantastical.Orwell paints a dark picture of misery, somehow made worse by the fact that nobody seems to know how miserable it is. It seemed odd how even though ""Big Brother is watching you"", few people show signs of wanting to rebel against it. This aspect is quite scary, because if nobody realises that they deserve freedom, then the Party really has gained all control. They work on eradicating thoughts and memories as well as just people and the past, so no one knows or remembers anything that allows them to fight back. I also found the portrayal of children quite disturbing, as it shows so clearly what the future holds unless something changes. It's like the next generation is born into thinking what's evil is good, so when they become adults there will be no hope left for society.One thing I absolutely loved about this book was the love story between Winston and Julia. It was as though they brought hope to the story, but at the same time making it even more tragic. Possibly the worst part of life under Big Brother is the abolition of love. You're not allowed to feel. Marriage is for children and any caring feelings towards any other except Big Brother makes you a traitor. More than anything, their relationship made me want for a happy ending.I was quite confused by the character of O'Brien. (view spoiler)[Were we supposed to think he was good or not? One minute he was in the Brotherhood then he's torturing Winston. I think it would have been clearer if Winston had started hating him for being a traitor, but he really didn't. In fact, he seemed to feel some sort of love towards him. I wish what he'd done had been clearer. (hide spoiler)]Overall I loved the book. I adored the characters (especially Julia! A new literary idol) and it really wants to make me read more dystopian books. I love how thorough Orwell is. I found the appendix really quite interesting: seeing how the language of newspeak is formed. I like that we can see how much work was put into the book through the little things such as this. It’s such a well thought out world, although it really is quite terrifying. I believe that this is a book that will always be relevant and should always be read.Favourite quote: “The paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was Julia’s life and his own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal.”"
2578,Håvard Bamle,'1984' is the single most personally influential novel I have ever read. It prompted me to study history and language and sent me on my current carreer path. Both an emotionally rivering plot and a setting which is one of the most approachable commentaries on modern world society written in the 20th century.

2580,Raluca,"Orwell""s books is a brilliant proof of what paranoia and imagination can create, but also that people need not invent monsters, for they are ever so capable of monstrosities. The book anticipates the turn of actions such as reality control, privacy invasion and espionage, but thankfully it has never come to be that free will should be obliterated. Yet, as the struggle for control still continues,would it be foolish to ask ourselves how long before paranoia turns into good reason?"
2581,Angelica,"i read this book a few years ago, and i have yet to revisit it's pages. although it's been so long i can never forget the intensity of this book. i'm only 15 years old now, and when i read it i had to have been at only 13 years of age. i sometimes question if i understood the full meaning of George Orwell's 1984. but even at my young age the message remains clear. this book is a haunting look into a future that one writer dared to predict. it tells the story of a lone man in a world where the government regulates everything. everything from your job, what you say, and how much contact you have with the opposite sex, even your thoughts.and in a world so vast and restricted a man and a women try to get back emotions that have long since been washed from the thoughts of all these people, by the one they call big brother, they seek comfort in each other, and real human contact, and a chosen connection safe from the government that holds them back.again, i could be wrong. but i loved this book so much. maybe for the fact that it was heart breaking and terrifying all at the same time. it could happen, people. it could happen."
2582,Neveen,"Inequality is the unalterabe law of human life.The ingeniousness of George Orwell (which is a pen name, by the way, did you know? I didn't!) can never be overstated. 1984 is a classic of the dystopian variety and was written in 1948-1949. Orwell/Eric Arthur Blair--sounds weird calling my man that--died two years after his novel was published. That is, to me, a very tragic notion. Glories that are earned after one perishes aren't really glories... This novel is amazeballs. Orwell is a golden writer of the English world and I don't think anyone can top him. Actually, I'm pretty sure no one can top him, considering the amount of trash and garbage inflow in the dystopian genre these days. Contemporary writings, like contemporary humans, are seemingly decreasing in intellect with every passing year and the rate of decreasing intellect only appears to be spinning faster and faster. Humanity, you displease me.""Has it ever occurred to you that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now?""Well, Orwell my hero, I think you've pegged that right. I'm already starting to see the signs of the deliberate, or even unconscious, degeneration of the language you so lovingly caressed in your novel. The world of 1984 has come and gone, and I didn't live to see it, woefully, but your prophecy appears to become more and more valid than invalid as the 21st century slowly rolls over.Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the voice, at the most, an occasional whispered word.I'm not going to expand upon the plot line. That is for prospective readers to step on themselves. It's not dystopia that Orwell creates, it could be a more humanized version of hell, more accurately. The crude society presented in 1984 is beyond the tolerance of any of us. To the liberal West, which has come crashing out of the gates of what they thought was a prison, you most definitely will die out in this society. It's a true horroshow. 'Horroshow' reminds me: the novel bears semblance to A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess. Or, rather, the opposite holds true, since Burgess existed after the cessation of Orwell. Both able writers, both owning a mind with an insight to the worst nature of mankind. ""They can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect.""These sentences, they were written more than 67 years ago. Orwell was a modern writer in an aged age. He described exquisite phenomenons, presented convoluted ideologies and spoke of metaphysics (all of which can be safely said to require a comprehension skill beyond that of our developed world's youths) in the very simplest of manners. If this isn't genius, what is?So ugly, and yet, so civilized.You can't underestimate the emotional range depicted in this book. I myself had never before empathized with the despairs and the desires our character experiences. Almost as if Orwell innovated a whole new set of various sensuality. The very fiber that knits the world of 1984 is fraught with slavery and going against that slavery is a machete in the form of two lovers, Winston and Julia. You will be Winston. You will feel what Winston feels. You will suffer what Winston suffers. You will learn, and then re-learn, what Winston learns and then re-learns. It's not the deviation in practise that George Orwell pinpoints to, it's the deviation of the mind. Of the very psyche that embodies the human nature. It is, in the lowest form, in kinship with solipsism. Solipsism, a word I've seen often, but have conversed with only just now.""I enjoy talking to you. Your mind appeals to me. It resembles my own mind, except that you happen to be insane.""1984 made its dent in my mind. Orwell scratched the surface of my cerebrum.Shh.Big Brother is watching."

2585,Claudia Toni,"Non pensavo che un uomo potesse concepire una cosa del genere. Ho appena finito di leggerlo e sono ancora sconvolta, perché ben prima dell'ultima pagina mi sono resa conto di come fosse angosciante il fatto che Orwell sia DAVVERO riuscito a farmi credere che un modo così possa realizzarsi.Winston sono io.I didn't think a man could conceive something like this. I just finished the reading and I'm still shocked, because even before the end, I realized how frightening the fact that Orwell REALLY made me believe a world like this COULD be possible was.I am Winston."
2586,Juan,"Este libro ya lo leí en su momento, cuanto iba al instituto. No, no, por supuesto que no era uno de los libros recomendados por el profesor de literatura de turno. La recomendación me llegó del mejor recomendador de libros que conozco, mi padre.Recuerdo que en su momento, con mi mente de adolescente, el libro me dejó un poco frío. No es que no me gustase, sino que no le supe sacar todo el jugo que yo sentía que el libro quería mostrar.Por eso, unos años después y entrado en la treintena, me decidí a darle una segunda oportunidad al libro. Conclusión: Fascinante.Ahora sí siento que he exprimido lo suficiente la novela para captar las ideas e implicaciones que muestra la distopía creada por Orwell. Veo las influencias de las grandes guerras y movimientos sociales de la primera mitad del siglo XX reflejadas en la novela.Sigo pensando que todavía le podría sacar más jugo al libro, pero mi cabeza no da para más. Puede que dentro de 20 años lo vuelva a intentar."

2589,Austin James,"I finished my first book of the new year – 1984 by George OrwellI had read Animal Farm as a teenager (and liked it). George Orwell is one of the most widely read authors of the 20th century for good reason. He has a simple, precise style of writing that reads easily. Combine this with his talent for telling a story rich in symbolism and you have his classic books which have become so frequently read, and loved by so many.I've never met someone whose read 1984 and not been affected by its strong presence. It's known for bringing about a strong reaction in people – I guess that's another reason it's a classic. It's one of those books that stays with you after you're finished. I think I figured out why that is.1984 evokes fear by exposing how vulnerable human behavior is to fear. Everything that happens in the book is fiction. Yet, in the darkest corner of our mind, we can see this fiction as a very real – very dark possibility.History doesn't exactly reassure us: The atrocities committed in the name of religion, the Holocaust, the communist purges of the 20th century – George Orwell is good at taking a bit from each and sculpting them into a new world, a world more sinister than anything we've come to know. He even discusses these historical events in the book – and goes on to say why these power grabs failed – and why this new dark future will be eternal. It's scary stuff to think about.Key to the story, is the idea that history can be re-written by those currently in power. Language can be manipulated. Add in fear, scapegoats, and propaganda – and you have a world without liberty, a world without free will, a less human world if you will. Is it extreme? Absolutely. Over the top? You bet. But it's almost as if the novel is begging you to prove these things will never happen."

2591,Pavan Kumar Vavilapalli,"George Orwell written this book,1984, in 1948 is a chilling prophecy about the future.The Party, Ingsoc - English Socialism, slogan is ""Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.""BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOUWAR IS PEACE.FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.Here the Party is having all the power, most powerful, than any other and controls the present which made it to control the past and further controls the future too. It can create the persons who are not existing at all, i.e., who had never existed in the present are existed in the past, and when once the act of forgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authenticated (like Comrade Ogilvy). In the same way, it can make the real person who is existing, as a person who never existed and unknown and don't have any identity (like Withers,Syme). Winston Smith, the lead character, is working in the Records Department whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens with every conceivable kind of information. He finds love with Julia. The Thought Police uncover every act of betrayal towards the Party and both Winston and Julia are drawn towards a conspiracy, as they begin to question the Party.For more http://www.myrezension.blogspot.in/20..."
2592,SJ,"How is it that I managed to get through both high school and two rounds of university without having read this book? It should be required reading, despite its disturbing content. My only fear throughout was its potential to used as an instruction manual instead of a cautionary tale. I'll be chewing on its content for some time to come."
2593,Joseph Keys,"The book that changed my view on the world. Reading this post 9/11 also contributed to it's impact, and coupled with all of the Bill Hicks shows I was listening to, this cemented as a paranoid socialist. The Americans reading might think that sounds awful. But that's why you need to read this book.In 1949, Orwell was already recognising the power of Technological Media and its potential for use in propaganda.A small (very small) spoiler is that there is a book that our Winston is given. This book describes how his world works. No wait, isn't it this world? No, it's his . . . strange.When I picked up the story, I imagined racing through to a triumph. The Hollywood ending if you'd like. Big Brother however, did not allow me this. Instead you find a crushingly realist saga, made sweet only the fact that this is not your world, despite its haunting similarities and you still have the chance to rise above conformity. You still have a free mind. The Thought Police and the Ministry of Peace may be fiction, but their unborn ghosts wait to be birthed. Don't let them."
2594,Rui Alves de Sousa,"Dizer que «1984», de George Orwell, é uma obra que possui uma fortíssima atualidade, já todos nós sabemos (e aliás, o aumento do número de vendas do livro nos EUA depois do escândalo da NSA ainda auxilia mais esse facto). Ao afirmar que a história distópica e (apenas figuradamente) futurista sobre Poder, Opressão e Manipulação é um alerta para o lado mau de qualquer ditadura, também não estou a acrescentar nenhuma novidade opinativa sobre esta obra prima literária. E ainda, ao manifestar a minha consideração de que o valor da história e das situações de «1984» torna-o uma peça de leitura obrigatória para qualquer ser humano, também não poderei acender novas luzes sobre esta narrativa. De tão bom que é «1984» e de tanto que já se disse e se escreveu e se debateu sobre o livro, parece impossível acrescentar-lhe alguma coisa de novo, no meio de um mar vasto e infindável de opiniões e interpretações que existem sobre a sua construção e as intenções de Orwell. E eu, um simples e ingénuo leitor/devorador de livros que me despertem a atenção como este me despertou, não poderei dizer mais nada de interessante ou relevante sobre «1984». Daí eu já ter lido a obra há uns meses e só agora é que consegui escrever alguma coisa sobre ela - mas infelizmente, não está a sair nada de jeito.Talvez reste apenas a experiência do leitor. Sim, porque lemos as opiniões sobre um determinado objeto cultural especial e particular, mas quando o consumimos e quando o sentimos, entramos noutra dimensão interpretativa que nunca caberá em qualquer ensaio ou dissertação ou conversa que se possa ter sobre ele. «1984» é um desses livros que nos deixa perturbados e confusos, e que desperta em nós um certo desejo de querer mudar o mundo. É uma delícia ler cada página da ficção (tão verídica) inventada por Orwell, e tão bem traduzida para português pela Antígona, e percebermos que este é um dos poucos livros que nos despertam os sentidos como os ""vulgares"" não conseguem fazer (sensação parecida com a que nos oferecem os grandes filmes, os grandes álbuns, as grandes peças, etc).Mas apesar de «1984» ser o livro mais famoso de Orwell, convém não esquecer que há outra obra prima, mais curta e mais incisiva, mas que é igualmente recomendável: «O Triunfo dos Porcos» («A Quinta dos Animais», numa tradução mais recente e que segue literalmente o título original). Ambos os livros lidam com a sociedade e os jogos de poder que se criam entre classes e ""chico-espertezas"" políticas e institucionais. Duas peças literárias que são um murro no estômago para o leitor, e que devem, ou melhor dizendo, têm de ser lidas. Depois de descobertas estas duas obras, talvez fiquemos a perceber um pouco melhor os grandes males que atravessarão para sempre este nosso mundo..."

2597,Ana Katzen,"LA GUERRA ES LA PAZLA LIBERTAD ES LA ESCLAVITUDLA IGNORANCIA ES LA FUERZA.Casi tengo miedo de escribir una reseña de esta novela, pues nada de lo que diga le hará justicia. Sin exagerar, me sacudió hasta los huesos. Al ser venezolana, no pude evitar ver las similitudes entre la ficción y la realidad: las masas idolatrando a un hombre, aceptando todo lo que se les dice sin importar las contradicciones, y, lo que es peor, la imposibilidad de una insurrección.En palabras simples, 1984 es la distopía más escalofriante de todas las que he leído. Es más, es el papá de las distopías. Es increíble que, habiendo sido escrita hace más de medio siglo, siga metiendo tanto miedo y acercándose tanto a la realidad. Solo de pensar en la posibilidad de que la realidad pudiera ser alterada al antojo de unos pocos y que la mayoría aceptara las mentiras ofrecidas sin reparar en las contradicciones hace que sude frío. Pero no hablo de una simple alteración de los hechos, sino de una reescritura completa, de un borrón e historia nueva:Quien controla el pasado controla el futuro. Quien controla el presente controla el pasado.Puedo continuar citando la novela, pero como dije en un principio, nada de lo que diga le hará justicia y sospecho que esta reseña carecerá de estructura porque el libro me entusiasma demasiado. Sencillamente, es brillante. Así que mejor me limito a callarme y recomendar 1984 a cualquier persona que me encuentre por ahí de ahora en adelante. En serio, tienes que leerla.Oh, una última cosa: la última frase fue un martillazo en toda la cara. Advertidos están."
2598,Alexa,"A classic for a reason.Set in a ""future"" where humans' every thought and action is monitored and scrutinized, a man named Winston journeys through an everyday life in the Outer Party. George Orwell presents this strange futuristic lifestyle to the reader in a normal, unphased manner, implying that the Hate Week and telescreens are, and always have been, a normal and unquestioned part of life in Oceania. Yet Winston, our protagonist, finds himself curious and doubtful of the government, or ""Big Brother"", and we find ourselves sympathizing & empathizing with him. In a sense, the reader becomes Winston.I must admit, the history part of the novel - presented in a reading of Goldstein's book - bored me to sleep. It took many an hour to get through those dreadful pages, and I was terrifyingly tempted to skip the entire thing. Some of the novel's suggestive parts induced quite a blush in my cheeks, but their existence proved necessary in developing the relationship between Winston and Julia.The ending's twist was astounding and emotional. It left me sad and with a sense of feeling unfulfilled, but the story still remained an incredible sensation."

2607,Abdulaziz Alseja,"1984 is by far one of the most beautiful books I have ever read! Although by the end of it a certain feeling of sorrow, almost sinking feeling as if drowning in a sea of complete despair, lingers in your thoughts. The book's raw characters, events and emotions keep your mind hooked on it where you desperately search for someone who read it just so you can have an in depth conversation of its contents! This is a must read classic that I am sure will consume your every thought until you have absorbed its underlying message! Great job George Orwell!"
2608,Momina Masood,"I seriously don't know what to say of this book. It is so terrifying, especially the second last chapter, that I nearly screamed in my mouth. I have had some experience with dystopian cinema, but none of it can ever come close to this. The real terror comes from the fact that it is so very convincing. Winston finally breaks down, and the ugliness in the chapter that I mentioned above, was so harrowing and heart-rendering that you must read it yourself to know what I'm saying.A daunting read! Read it at your own risk."
2609,French Giant,"I have no legitimate excuse to justify the fact that it's taken me 30 years to read this book. Perhaps I could blame it on the small town, backwoods high school I went to for the fact that they did not cover it within their curriculum? Or perhaps I can blame myself for going to a technical college where I spent the vast majority of the time studying the language of operating systems (which are now obsolete mind you) rather than cracking open a few classics for a required English Literature course at a ""normal"" school? Regardless of where the blame is placed I finally decided that it was time to take the plunge and I'm glad that I did. I won't even attempt to write a proper review of a classic novel like this as I'll most likely just end up regurgitating what has already been said in countless other reviews over the years. In a nutshell (and a very tiny one at that) what I found most amazing about this book is that while it was written way back in 1949 it is incredibly pertinent to the world we live in today...which makes it all the more frightening. That's all I got. So stop being a prole and read the damn book already. GoodReads is watching you."

2611,Kishore,"My hands weren't the only thing that shivered. This was soul stirring. Masterfully written - even though if our physical reality is not what has been described - the ground realities are the same, as George Orwell thought in 1948.There are some books you remember for a while, and talk and laugh about later.This is not one of those. Because there is another kind.The kind that makes you think."
2612,William David Hannah,"The standard by which all dystopian literary visions are judged, it is predominantly seen as a treatment of totalitarianism and government surveillance and control. But the most profound, far-reaching, and relevant aspect of its troubling world is the concept that, as Orwell says, ""He who controls the present, controls the past. He who controls the past, controls the future."" "
2613,Zineb Gharbal,"Though Fictional, a worthwhile read. "
2614,Erick Pettersen,"Whether you enjoy science fiction or not, Orwell's 1984 is a must read. Orwell writes like Monet paints, in that his description of 1984 is opaque yet colorful, mysterious, and beautiful.Throughout 1984, the reader follows Winston Smith, who lives in Airstrip One. The world is subdivided into three major super powers. Winston lives in Oceana, which is run by Big Brother. Three ministries govern Oceana: The Ministry of Truth, Ministry of Love, and Ministry of Peace. Winston works for the Ministry of Truth, and it is there he meets Julia.Much like Orwell’s description of the scenes themselves, he creates a world in which the reader feels they are looking at Oceana through a sheet. Orwell never describes Oceana or 1984 in too much detail; though, in his descriptions of Winston’s relationships to the world he lives in, Julia, and Big Brother, he writes with enough description that Orwell’s vision of the future becomes more apparent with each page.The most striking scene is when a poet is thrown into prison because he refused to take out the word, “God” from a poem he transcribed because no other word fit. No matter a person’s spiritual background, the critical person should find it uncanny that in 1949 Orwell imagined a world in which the name ‘God’ would become illegal.Though, we do not live in a world in which three empirical superpowers govern us, the critical person should wonder if we are closer to Orwell’s 1984 than we realize. Or, perhaps, ideologically, we are there and realize it; though, we have become so accustomed to living in Orwell’s 1984 that we willingly give up our rights and personal identity in the name of government sanctioned security and equality. "
2615,Connor Ottem,"George Orwell's dystopian opus 1984 is a wholly terrifying piece of fiction. There's a palpable sense of reality here, and the way it can be connected to our modern world is almost unreal. Everything the Party does can be reflected in our governments today. It's not hard to see other countries such as China or North Korea go to the extreme measures presented in 1984. In fact, the NSA's recent security breaches almost resembles the constant surveillance done by the Party.Orwell was an intelligent man. He knew enough about how politics and the human mind work to construct a story that masterfully examines both. This is not a simple black-and-white story about a man who knows that his government is oppressing the people. That's certainly there, but it's not what makes it special. What makes it special is that the book shows the futility of such struggles. While Brave New World displayed similar themes, it was firmly nestled in the realm of fantasy and sci-fi so as to lessen the impact. 1984 on the other hand does not hold back; it grabs the reader by the neck and shows him the very real possibility that this can and probably will happen and there's naught we can do to stop it when it does. And what makes it worse is that, unlike the the year the book was written (1948 for those of you wondering), we have the technology to emulate the Party. 1984's edges have been sharpened, rather than eroded, by the sands of time, and the cuts are deeper as a result.This is truly a brilliant book, and if for some insane reason you have not read, I encourage you to do so. It is a frightening little tale and one that speaks volumes more than sixty years after its publication."
2616,Bardha,"1984 warns us that ignoring the violent side of human nature can cost us our individual freedom. Difficult political ideas are expressed in a very simple and elegant style. Almost all the language associated with the Party is extremely ironic (Big Brother is a cruel tyrant, not a loving, protecting friend; the Ministry of Truth manufactures lies; and the Ministry of Love tortures, kills and destroys). Similarly, the contradictory party slogans (War is Peace; Freedom is Slavery; Ignorance is Strength) reflect the inherent absurdity of the party policy itself."

2619,Arah-Lynda,"1984 is a profound and disturbing read and one that I think will continue to resonate with me always.That says a lot about a story. And this is one that will not soon be forgotten; it creeps into your pores and reverberates there, gently.  I really thought that this was a 4 star book, because for me, there were parts of this story that seemed weighed down in excessive, philosophical detail; I mean I got it already, heavy. But in the end it was simply this story and its continued relevance today that had the greatest impact on me. What more could a writer ask for? 2 + 2 = Five Full Stars! "
2620,Ithilwen,"Hay libros que se viven. Libros que se sobrevive a ellos. Este no es ninguno de esos. Es imposible vivirlo cuando estás atrapado en un mundo gobernado por el odio, en el que no existen el amor, la pasión o la confianza. Un mundo distópico que estuvo a un paso de hacerse realidad, pero del que ahora nos alejamos para llegar a algo quizás peor. No puedes sobrevivir a un libro que esconde en su innegable optimismo un pesimismo tan pútrido que te repugna y te provoca náuseas. Es imposible hacerlo cuando cada palabra se te clava como un puñal en el corazón porque intuyes el desastre que se está urdiendo entre cada línea. ¿Qué clase de libro es este, entonces? Para mí es que ni siquiera es un libro. Durante algo más de tres meses ha sido mi almohada, mi sustrato, mi fuente de los deseos y mi fuente de pensamientos incendiarios que se avivaban con cada sátira, con cada crítica, con cada piedra lanzada a su propio tejado. Es pura filosofía; más allá del fondo político también se entrecruzan ideas metafísicas y epistemológicas, aderezado con antropología y ética para dar una obra de dimensiones monumentales. Podría concluir afirmando que esta novela es un monumento y aún me quedaría guardadas muchísimas ideas en la alacena de mi corazón, pero creo que esa palabra, monumento, la describe con acierto. Porque es tan hermoso, tan horrible, tan repugnante y tan maravilloso que, sin duda, merece un hueco en la eternidad. Aunque el pasado no exista, aunque un solipsismo desmesurado me asegure que este libro es un mero producto de mi imaginación. Es difícil cerrar un libro que te ha gustado, pero lo es más aún cuando entre sus páginas has encontrado el consuelo de saberte cuerdo en un mundo de locos para acabar en mitad de un vendaval de miseria y decadencia humana, de traición y de odio, cuando te ha hecho plantearte hasta tu propia existencia y tu vida, si es que ese concepto existe. ¿Sabéis qué es lo que sé con certeza? Que este libro se me ha clavado muy dentro y no quiero que salga nunca. Quiero que sea este libro uno de los que lea a mis hijos, nietos o sobrinos para que se duerman, uno de los que tendré siempre en la mesilla de noche por si me apetece releer cualquier fragmento de los muchos que he marcado, uno de los que se han ganado las mejores palabras que he podido encontrar en mi mente confusa y debilitada por la magnífica, aguda y certera prosa de mi, desde ahora, adorado George Orwell."
2621,Joana Guerra,"Que livro! Agora percebo as excelentes críticas que sempre ouvi a seu respeito. George Orwell desenvolveu o futuro da humanidade de uma forma que merece destaque, a opressão em que vivem os habitantes da Oceânia conseguia fazer-se sentir, quando mais não fosse se me pusesse a pensar no que tenho, na forma como todos nós vivemos, e se em determinado momento praticamente tudo o que adoramos fazer, aqueles momentos de liberdade e lazer que nos fazem agradecer o privilégio de estarmos vivos, simplesmente desaparecessem. E se o simples facto de ler '1984' fosse um acto contra o Partido, quase como crimepensar. Outras das coisas que me agradou bastante no livro, foi o facto de eu (leitor) tal como o personagem (Winston Smith) termos sido enganados durante praticamente todo o livro. Ambos pensávamos que os seus segredos (de Winston) estavam bem guardados e não estavam a ser observados. É esmagador imaginar que pode haver um final feliz, que A Fraternidade existe e vai haver uma luta para restaurar a liberdade, e em certo momento tudo cai por terra, nada consegue derrotar o Partido. Não há nada a fazer, apenas o conformismo e aceitar os factos, não como eles são, mas como nos ordenam que sejam. Uma obra-prima."
2622,شذا خالد,"انتابتني الدهشة عندما علمت أن جورج أورويل كتب ""1984"" في عام 1949 في محاولة للتنبؤ بما سيحل بالعالم , خيال اورويل نجح في رسم صورة مطابقة للواقع بصورة كبيرة .بصراحة لا أعتقد أنه بإمكاني وضع تلخيص جيد للرواية لأنني لم أستطع أن ألم بكل ما ورد بها من أفكار و استنتاجات من المرة الأولى لكنني استطيع أن أقول أنها تتحدث عن الهدف الأوحد للحزب الشمولي , انه تشويه إنسانية الإنسان و قتل كل ما هو جميل فيه , و تجريده من الأخلاق وحرمانه من كل متعة .. لأن أي شعور للإنسان بإنسانيته سيقوده للوعي و الوعي سيقوده بالضرورة للثورة ..السلطة لدى الحزب الشمولي لا تعني أن يخضع المواطن للأوامر فحسب بل أن يخضع لها بذلّ عليه , عليه أن يختار ال 5 جوايا ل 2 × 2 لا بل أكثر من ذلك عليه أن يكون صادقا في ذلك !تبدو أي محاولة للوعي في هذا المجتمع مستحيلة , فالكل يتجسس على الكل , شاشات الرصد في كل مكان ., مكبرات الصوت موجودة في البساتين والحقول , لا يمكنك الثقة بأحد , المجتمع ممزق بصورة ممنهجة , يتعلم الطفل في المعسكرات أن لا يرحم حتى أباه إن هو أخطأ في حق ""الأخ الكبير"" ... يبدو كل ذلك معروفاً لكن لماذا ؟لماذا يشوه المجتمع لهذه الدرجة , يبدو أن الحزب الشمولي يبني سلطته على هذا الكم من الكراهية و التجهيل و التمزيق , لأن ""هدف الحزب من السلطة ليس الارتقاء بالمجتمع بل غايته هي السلطة ذاتها "", و في سبيل ذلك يمكنه أن يغيرالتاريخ ويمحي أشخاص من الوجود ويخلق أشخاص وهميين , يمكنه أن يكذب وفي اليوم التالي يكذب الكذبه , لا بل حتى يمكنه أن يحرم زوجين من ممارسة حبهما و بالتالي السعي لتأمين التناسل بطرق مخبرية مجردة من العاطفة ..أظهر جوروج أورويل تشاؤما في نهاية روايته , ربما قصد من ذلك العكس !! على العموم أثبت التاريخ فعلياً ما ذهب إليه وينستون في بداية الرواية ألا وهو أن الأمل منصب على العامّة وأنهم إن وعوا ثاروا وإن ثاروا وعوا ...لا يمكن اعتبار ""1984"" رواية ممتعة فحسب , إنها من النّوع الذي يجب أن يُهيأ له ركنٌ رحبٌ في الذاكرة , وأعتقد أنه يتوجب عليّ إعادة قرائتها في وقت قريب .."
2623,Iva,"1984. by George Orwell aka Eric Arthur Blair is the last book he wrote and it completely blew me away. It was kinda boring at first even though it was totally creepy in the whole concept of the word describing the miserable world they live, and pretty interesting. But boring. I was reading it slow. But then the part of the book by Goldstein amazed me. And I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. The whole world of totalitarianism just plain frightened me and changed my view in a lot of things. I knew that the world hasn't seen anything yet. And hopefully it won't come even close to this, even though this is just an imaginary world. Crept the life out of me."
2624,Salvador Nunez,"After reading this great book, I look at the world a different way. In the book everyone was terrorized by the government (The Party) and just how much security was implemented to their citizens. Even though I don't live in a world like Winston's where we have to worry about our thoughts or not being able to love and show affection to a person, I feel like we are heading at that direction. And the reason for this is because of how many cameras are around the world just watching us just like those damn telescreens. Some of the reasons why I liked the book was because of how the author's point of view of was of the future. I also liked it because of the plot twist near the end. I had persuaded myself that he will die after the torturing that O'Brien did to Winston but in the end all he did was ""cure"" him. Another reason I also liked it was because of the personality that he made for O'Brien. Just the way that he works like a double agent a horrible nemesis but also a great friend to talk to is just something not seen in most books nowadays. All in all I just loved the book for the characters and the plot line. I just hope that one day our government doesn't turn into a communism like The Party was in 1984."
2625,Diana,"Wow.I will need some time to recover from such a powerful book. George Orwell takes us on a tour around London, but it is not just a normal holiday tour. It is a tour around the London he speculates will exist in 1984, if Britain is overcome by a totalitarian party. In this dystopian novel, we are at once made aware that privacy is impossible, war is continuous and freedom is imaginary. The reader learns of Winston's dreary routine, his smelly apartment, his unappetizing meals and of his hatred towards the party and towards Big Brother. There never was a book which made me feel as insignificant as a human being as this. I shivered, and almost exclaimed out loud that the party is not fair, that this is not how a country should be led. That I am a human and as a human being I deserve rights. That I need my privacy. That just like the Inner Party, I need comfort, and good food. Certain scenes made me shiver with indignation at what Winston went through because of what he believed in. But I know it is true because I know that even nowadays there are countries applying this form of ruling to their people.I absolutely detest how this book made me feel - useless, worthless and perishable. Vivid, graphic images exposing how powerless the human body is. I actually took a day's break from the book because I could not stand the way it affected me. However, if I ever got the chance to meet Orwell, in the afterlife perhaps, I would tell him with regards to 'Nineteen Eighty Four': ""Well written, comrade. Bloody well written."""
2626,Lee Foust,"I just finished teaching this novel that I had not read for at least 30 years. Much of what I would otherwise have written here I got to discuss in my class so I'll limit myself to noting two things: 1) This is a truly terrific and very important novel both in terms of its devastating and utterly necessary political message and also in terms of it's sharp and often beautiful prose and 2) I believe that 1984 is about love.I once wrote a prose poem that's premise stated: ""Love is the most subversive act in which two or more people can engage."" 1984, in my opinion, constructs a political party and system responding to that theory. If love between individuals is the ultimate expression of human freedom, then of course the most oppressively totalitarian state would have to seek to isolate and alienate us all and, ultimately, demand not only that we conform to the norms of its ideology, but that we end up like Winston Smith in the last line of the novel, conquering ourselves (all that we are as individuals) and learning to love Big Brother, the state's probably fictitious poster boy. To further prove my thesis, I would have you note that Smith is caught and interrogated not when he begins to defy the State by writing or through thought crime, but only when he begins a love affair with another party member, and that the interrogation process takes him step-by-step through all of the things that he has come to love in his clandestine search for individuality, culminating with the renunciation of his lover, Julia, under the most hideous of all tortures--only then can Big Brother move in to become the one and only object of love allowed in a State that demands our all, our love at the expense of all other objects of affection.Only flaw in this novel is the lengthy interjection of passages from Emmanuel Goldstein's book The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism in the second section. These passages slowed down the plot unduly and went over a lot of ground that had already been so much more cleverly disclosed through the narrative in the novel's first section. We did learn a few new, interesting things about the world situation (within the novel's fiction) but I did not find the trade-off worthwhile--red pencil, please."
2627,yossra khardani,the novel forsees the future with its very details !! One of the best books ever 
2628,Marta Oliva,"I hardly ever reread, but this book is probably my favorite and I'm so glad I picked it up again to remind myself of how brilliant it is. There's not that much action, but the ideas this story presents are incredible, and kind of terrifying. How people can live being constantly watched, in a society full of nonsense, but where everything, as crazy as it may be, is accepted if the party says it is true. The party has the power because it controls everybody's minds, and no one can't escape, they won't let them. It terrifies me how someone could be so powerful as in to make their opposers absolutely change their minds, practically become different persons after they torture them and wash their brains for months. That's what happened with Winston, and even if his story is not hopeful, it's so worth the read."
2629,Arjun,"1984 was not a book I enjoyed very much. It was more of a large description of what Orwell imagined the future would be like. I feel that the story itself was very simple. Orwell's writing is very clear and easy to understand, but I wasn't particularly fascinated with the dystopian world that he created. I wasn't engrossed in the world that he created. One good thing that I liked about the book was that the ideas that he wrote about were interesting.If only the plot of the story was better. Overall, the book was a good description of a totalitarian society of the future, but was not very interesting."
2630,Erika,"Dear God this book is absolutely frightening. I wanted to fight through every word, every horrible truth telling words. "
2631, Suzanne Kapelus,"I read this book both for school and because I'd read other distopian books that had been written over the past few years and enjoyed them. Now, that I have read 1984, I look at the Hunger Games, the Matched series and the Eve books with distaste and astonishment. How could I have thought those were even slightly good? The way in which George Orwell wrote this book is phenomenal. He took separate ideas that on their own are brilliant, unique and cut right to the core of what society could turn into and arranged them so that they formed a stunning, breath-taking, mind-boggling and quite simply beautiful book that challenges ones beliefs, ideas on society and thoughts on oneself. Ideas like Newspeak, Thoughtcrime and Doublethink are something, like Winston said about the book, that are in front of us but we don't realize. This is one of the best books that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. "
2632,Jenna,"Satirical novel of a political fiction about a society in Oceana who was oppressed by the Party with a totalitarian doctrine perpetuated by ""Ingsoc"" or English Socialism. This institution was founded by the ""Big Brothers"" who regulated the system to the name of the greater good.But Winston Smith is very industrious, and proficient worker who's having idea of an outbreak towards the Ingsoc totalitarianism. He thinks that the world view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapble of understanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because these people never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them.He was infrangible and didn't concede to the totalitarian regime for him to die was freedom, which is a very sad ending."
2633,Roof Beam Reader,Read the review:Thoughts on a Dystopian Classic: http://classiclit.about.com/od/orwell...
2634,Nicolas  Vargas,"""La mayor de las herejías era el sentido común. Y lo más terrible no era que le mataran a uno por pensar de otro modo, sino que pudieran tener razón. Porque, después de todo, ¿cómo sabemos que dos y dos son efectivamente cuatro? O que la fuerza de la gravedad existe. O que el pasado no puede ser alterado. ¿Y si el pasado y el mundo exterior sólo existen en nuestra mente y, siendo la mente controlable, también puede controlarse el pasado y lo que llamamos la realidad?""No creo haber leído antes un libro con tanta fuerza, tanta coherencia en principios inverosímiles, aterradores y sin embargo, muy posibles. La tortura a Winston resulta realmente macabra, tanto como el fanatismo desmedido del Partido y culminando con el aterrador final que, sin embargo, inexorablemente siempre esperó; ""lo más terrible era que pudieran tener razón""."

2639,Lola G.,"Oh this book! Everyone has to read it in high school and for good reason. It's the best book ever. Not only can I forever say, ""I was born in the future,"" (1984 is my birth year) but I also learned what it means to question authority and think for myself as a teenager. I remember this book being so truly cool. I should probably re-read it as an adult. "
2640,Gizella Caicedo,Un gran libro! una historia no muy apartada de lo que es la realidad en nuestros días. Increíble como este autor logra captar el interés del lector con una historia que es ficticia pero que cuenta tantas verdades! super recomendado!
2641,Ally,"I'm not sure how much I can offer on a review that hasn't already been said before about this novel. First off, I felt like I was the only person on the planet who hadn't read 1984 yet. I must have missed it somewhere on my required high school reading list. I had started it a few times in the past and never finished it. I was finally ready though to explore all that 1984 had to offer, and wow, I am glad that I did.There are some slower parts - some may enjoy the doctrines or the explanations of war - but that was tedious for me to get through. Going into 1984 I knew about some of the themes like Big Brother and the telescreens - but I had no clue where the actual plot of the story would go. There are some fascinating moments with Winston, the main character, and his love interest, Julia. These moments give you the slightest glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, there might a happy ending for some people in this world.Without giving away specific details on how the story progresses - I will just say that I have never been so uncomfortable and terrified while reading a book in my life. 1984 gives you food for thought on the way the world is run, how to be aware of your choices, and hopefully how not to repeat the same mistakes of this world. Throughout the story I had a sinking feeling it would not end well. I didn't see how it could. I had never wanted to be more wrong. Unfortunately, it ends the only way it could in this world filled with complete and utter control over one's mind, body, and at last, heart. "
2642,Matthew Fray,"Was expecting this to be dull and impenetrable because friends of mine had done it at school. But it wasn't it was clear, and up-front, and bleak and fiercely intelligent. This is an intellectual's dystopia where an intellectual elite are in charge and seek to control every person's perception. Shot through with a contempt for the lower classes. Very powerful."
2643,Metatron,"I read my old review about this book and I couldn't help cringing from how pathetic it was. It does this ass-kicking novel no justice at all!""1984"" is the kind of novel that stays with you, even after a while. When I first read it, I was new into the whole ""reading frenzy"" stuff, and it's actually the first novel I ever read, fully. And at the same time, this novel started my love affair with reading in general, and helped slay the unsubstantiated idea I had that reading books was boring (
because I've read a lot since I was a little girl, but not books, I've read from the Internet
). This I owe to my sister, who came to my aid once I asked her to recommend me books. This is the first one she recommended, without hesitation, the second being ""
The Brothers Karamazov
"" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky; which I immediately jumped to after devouring this one. I'll be eternally grateful to her for the day she recommended these two books to me. They, in a way, touched me and changed my perception in many things. To this day, the intro words send goosebumps throughout my skin: ""
It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen
"". I can write them from memory. No, not because they're easy to remember, but because these are the words, though being the first in the book, that drew my complete attention to the book and didn't allow me to put it down. This fierce novel is, perhaps, Eric Blair's best handiwork and a powerful warning against the dangers of a totalitarian society. Torture to brainwash citizens, the Two-Minute Hate and the worship of Big Brother; all these elements are made to craft walking-zombies for citizens. Some people say that a gloomy and extremist environment such as the one in ""1984"" isn't possible, but I think it is, and that it's already here. North Korea, for instance, functions as a single-party state under a totalitarian dictatorship, where the citizens are brainwashed, tortured by famine and obliged to worship Kim Jong-un as a God (Big Brother, much?), and though they don't have the Two-Minute Hate concept, North Korea's government does a fine job instilling hatred towards the United States in their citizens; blaming the US for their situation and pain, not allowing them access to the Internet with the pretext that they're protecting their citizens from harm, when in reality, they're protecting them from the truth while scattering lies and ignorance, to create more ignorants in the process. North Korea government = the Party and Big Brother.The United States = Emmanuel Goldstein and his followers.The lies instilled in the citizens to hate the US = Two-Minute Hate.Now that I've been thinking about the novel, this is what I presume and feel. Complete totalitarianism is here, and ""1984"" was a fierce warning towards a totalitarian society/government. What a terrifying prediction it was. Another aspect of the novel that fascinates me is how thought and language mould and shape the human mind and the control of it. One of the major themes in the novel is power and control, and language forms a major part in the doing of both elements. Half the tool of controlling is language and the other half is torture. Every aspect of Oceania's society is controlled---even the impulses of love and sex. Jesus, it's like Half-Life 2 all over again! There is no personal space, no free thoughts as even thoughts which are wrong in the Party's eyes are a crime (thoughtcrime). It's a compelling aspect---specially when many elements are being played out perfectly, like a divine plan, in real life. I suppose that the political oppression Blair observed in both Germany and Spain was bad enough for him to think it wouldn't get better; he exaggerated many aspects in his novel but was still accurate in his ""prediction"". Hoo-ray for prophets!It's not easy to do justice to a novel that's changed your perception in many things, specially when it conveys you a river of emotions and you can barely put them in order one by one and explain them, so bear with me for the sloppy review.This is an amazing read and I'd recommend it to anyone, without hesitation and in a heartbeat; not because this is a classic and classics are considered by many to be books everyone's supposed to read before they die, but because we're talking about a book where there's a futuristic political hierarchy which transmutes even the simplest concepts. Where the antagonists create an insane amount of ministries dedicated to transmuting all aspects of a social life; in the case of the protagonist, the Ministry of Truth dedicates to reshaping every historical occurrence and manipulates them so the past adjusts to the version they want to convey, hence making their brainwashing easier. They are literally re-writing history, hence the phrase ""
Who controls the past, controls the future, who controls the present, controls the past
""(Book I, chapter III). This insane creativity makes the novel a wonderful read, and I'd recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat because whether you enjoy the novel or not, it will enlighten you and offer you an interesting perspective. It will contribute something to you. 
“If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—forever. And remember that it is forever. The face will always be there to be stamped upon.”- O'Brien, chapter III, page 277. "
2644,Arin Melikian,""" War is Peace, Freedom is slavery, Ignorance is strength."" 1984 is a story written by George Orwell that takes place in the future for his time which he wrote to be, ""1984."" The story takes place in a fictional region of the world called, Oceana. Everyone in this region is constantly being watched by the government also know as, ""Big Brother"" through telescreens located everywhere in the public. This way, if someone tries to commit a certain crime or illegal activity, the government will find out immediately through the telescreens. The world in 1984 is very horrid and difficult to live in because of the different things that the government does to the people which is basically taking away their freedom and rights. For example, the government takes certain words and phrases out of books and if an editor decides to keep the word in the book that the government doesn't want, that person will be arrested and vaporized(erased from history.) The main character Winston Smith works in a department known as the Ministry of Truth that deals with rewriting history and documentation so if the party decides to erase something from history so people will be oblivious to it, they may do so. A quote from Winston states, ""People simply disappeared, always during the night. Your name was removed from the registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, your one-time existence was denied and then forgotten. You were abolished, annihilated: vaporized was the usual word"" (15). Winston is written to be in his middle age years because the government keeps people unknown to what their actual age is. He lives in an apartment by himself and tries to write a diary about his life but this is a risky thing to do because it is a crime to record things that will remain throughout history. Winston develops a disliking for ""Big Brother"" once he notices how much the government ruins people's lives. This book has a lot of political and social messages that are very interesting because they show the reader a scary perspective of the government having complete control over everyone and everything also known as totalitarianism. The main character Winston lives somewhat of a depressing life just like most people in the book because they don't have any privacy and they live by rations of food, drinks and other items like cigarettes. The book is very suspenseful because Winston starts to do risky activities that would get him in trouble with ""Big Brother."" The fact that this book was so suspenseful and politically influenced makes it a great story and a classic. The most suspenseful part of this book is when Winston fell in love with a girl who is a lot younger than he is and the risky part was meeting up with her because he could be easily caught by the telescreens. Political messages in the story include the slogans that the government makes up for the people to remember like "" War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is strength."" This slogan is made up in the book to show the people that the government is more superior to them and that what ever the government says people have to live by even though it might be harsh. Another political message that the author put in the book was the political system which is called Ingsoc (English Socialism). The people in the story are under governmental rule known as English Socialism which is basically the political system where the government has total power. The reason why George Orwell included it in the book was because during the time he was writing the story, the English government wanted to make Socialism their primary political belief and George Orwell wrote it in the book to show how horrible it would turn out it to be if it became the main type of government. This book definitely deserves a five out of five stars because of its beautifully written pages about political and social suffrage. It is such a memorable book that will leave the reader with a really good impression. 1984 is not an easy book to read and understand so its recommended to be read by adults or teens. This is not a children's story because it has some political messages that would just be too hard to understand for a child under thirteen. Also some parts of the book can be inappropriate for younger kids because of the sexual references and violence. 1984 is a book that everyone should read because it teaches people the predictions of people like George Orwell had for the future.

2645,أحمد البخاري,أعتقد أن هذه الرواية ليست مجرد رواية ..إنها نظرية متكاملة .. فلسفة قائمة بحد ذاتها .. تجربة تصنف نفسك بقبل وبعد .. قبل 1984 .. وبعد 1984 .. لابد أن تقرأ هذه الرواية لكي تضيف لنفسك بعد آخر .. لن أتحدث كثيراً .. إقرأها ولن تندم ..
2646,Ȝabdelrahman Farouk,"أنا هكتفى باقتباس بعض الجمل فى الكتاب:-إن جريمة الفكر لا تفضى إلى الموت إنها الموت نفسه- فى هذه اللعبة التى نلعبها ليس فى استطاعتنا أن نفوز ، إذ كل ما فى الأمر أن بعض الفشل أهون من بعض- لم تكن فلسفتهم تنكر صلاحية التجربة فحسب و إنما كانت تنكر أيضا وجود الحقيقة الظاهرة ، كذلك كانوا يعتبروا ضلال الضالين عين العقل- فى جميع العصور كان الحكام يسعون إلى فرض رؤية زائفة عن العالم على رعاياهم- إن السلطة ليست وسيلة بل غاية ، فالمرء لا يقيم حكما استبداديا لحماية الثورة ، و إنما يشعل ثورة لإقامة حكم استبدادى- الحرب هى السلام.. الحرية هى العبودية.. الجهل هو القوة""إنها رواية تقرأ ، ثم تقرأ من جديد"""
2647,Alfid Hadiat," The whole novel of 1984 is in, it's purest form, an essay about totalitarianism governments. Still a really good book, though. The book gets fairly boring during the middle and leading up to the end... But part 3 is where the pace begins to pick up again. It's essentially a novel that fits well into the time of when George Orwell wrote the book, a little after World War II, where a bunch of crap is happening to the people and our good Orwell here is trying to remind them to avoid some stuff so that they can avoid the government like in George Orwell. It's been over 70 years now that this amazing piece of English literature has been released, and I think is a novel that everybody should read. It's a book that will remind us why language is an art, that as long as we can still think for ourselves, we are free, and that we should remain loyal to the ones we care about... Because if language is taken away, if our freedom of thought becomes oppressed, and our language is narrowed down to have a smaller vocabulary, then we'd probably be in 1984. "
2648,Mario,"This is the first book that gave me actual nightmares, so that's saying something.Out of all the worlds I've read about, this one definitely scared me the most. And why? Because it is so close to today's world. And knowing that this book was written more than 60 years ago, just shows how big of a genius Orwell was. What made it even more scary, was the ending. At first, I felt iffy about the ending. But after giving it some thought, I felt like it was the perfect way to end the story like this one. It just made the book that much realistic.One of the most terrifying books that I've read (so far), but also one of the best. And even though I loved it this much, I don't think I'll be re-reading it anytime soon."
2649,Marie,This should be a must read for everyone.
2650,Larissa,"I've been reading quite a bit of dystopian fiction lately, but this book can't really be called dystopian and the events within it aren't even really fiction . . .It's called a utopia, but I can't call it that either. When it was written, it was probably a frightening future, but at this point (even though the year 1984 has come and gone) this book is what I could easily see society becoming in the near future. I'm not going to get too much into this, but the phrase ""War is Peace"" really struck me as something our current politicians would most certainly say and even seem to have convinced us of. As simply a novel, 1984, is well written. I enjoyed Winston and his voice. His confusion comes through quite well. I also enjoyed the descriptions about Julia, even though I did not particularly enjoy her character. The story unfolded in a way that was easy to follow, yet impossible to not be touched by. Dystopias of today generally end with the hero overcoming the evil overlords and establishing some form of new, more free order. This book does not end so hopefully, but it felt realistic as the world that Orwell built (or predicted?) does seem to be somewhat indestructible. "
2651,Maria,"I love dystopias and I was obviously expecting great things from this book, inumerous times mentioned as ""one of the best books ever"", ""a book everyone should read"", ""a must read classic"", ""one of the most disturbing books ever"", ""one of the most influential books in history"", ""one of the best philosophical books"", etc., etc, etc. The point is, whatever list it integrates, it is always right in the top. Both speacialists and teachers (and bookworms in general) agree that this is a book not to miss.You just can't deny that this is a great book. If not because of the great story and the great plot, at least because of the message it carries and the study of human behaviour Orwell needed to have done in order to write those perfectly brilliant essays on war, freedom, social hierarchies, politics and so on.It is quite clear why any dictatorship would ban or censor this book. It is a threat. In the reading of this book, the reader gains a whole new perspective of life, a new understanding of the foundations of totalitarism and political power.If our history has shown us anything, it is that deep human nature does not change throughout time and in studying it without being afraid to put our finger where it hurts, we can answer all our questions on human character. We have the tools we need in order to make this world an awesome place to live in, there is only one inconvenient keeping us from doing something about it: ourselves.Because I simply adore to find out more about how foul and addle our species is, I found this novel a treat. Our very worst is here exposed with such rawness, I just can't help but to be captivated and ultimately fascinated.Relativism is taken to a new extreme here, there is just no way you can ever know anything for sure. The past is constantly altered, as the ""truth"". Any demonstration of feelings can get you slayed and you are always being watched. Affection is discouraged, even between family members, in fact, parents usually end up being sent to the Ministry of Love (where the torture - and I mean, real heart wrenching, nerve racking, what the fuck is wrong with this goddamned people torture - and slaughter go down) by their own kids, which are put in groups meant to format their minds into what is desired since the very begining.Constant warfare is necessary in order to maintain peace; having the freedom to act and, more importantly, to think, will enslave you to unimportant vices and feelings; and, at last, remaining ignorant about what really is happening around you will be best for you (cough, cough, for the Party, cough, cough).I'd already understood this after reading Animal Farm, 1984 just confirmed it, and I have to say it: Orwell is/was just a fucking genius.Compared to the system he created, all fascist regimens that ever existed since there is record (you know, those we learn about in school, lead by those fine specimens of the human race that were Hitler, Stalin, Mao Tse Tung...) can be ridiculed for having such big, obvious and easily avoidable flaws. But hey, I'm glad they were flawed, I may be misanthropic but I've never been further away from being genocidal."
2652,Priyatham Bollimpalli,The world presented here is absolutely horrifying and depressing. It is dark and hopelessly realistic. What is even more terrifying is that some of the things in the novel are inspired from real incidents. A classic masterpiece. Highly recommended.
2653,Ace,will re-read...
2654,Hanna,Great book. Not exactly a typical novel.
2655,April,"Truly progressive thinking and warnings from Orwell. Given his background and personal history and experience, this is quite fitting coming from him. He creates a society that could potentially exist if humans gave into the importance of power and domination over everything else--over humanity itself. I wonder if our current technology and the encouragement of materialism and vanity may produce a society that places humanity below these. Certainly the availability of information and over-sharing by people can cause one to be more narrow-minded than open-minded, to buy into only the ways of thinking that serve the individual. We must continue to strive for a balance between the individual and the collective. As we gain more freedoms for all groups in our society, does it really make us more free or more bound by some need to control these freedoms? I hope that we will always have a place for love, community, and gratitude that will overcome hatred.As a writer, he is thoughtful in his descriptions and even within such an intense subject matter delivers bits of comedy and beauty. ""Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face. His powers of sweating were extraordinary. At the Community Center you could always tell when he had been playing table tennis by the dampness of the bat handle."" pg. 55.Book: Skyline College library book."

2659,Marcos Kopschitz,"George Orwell, (pseudônimo de Eric Arthur Blair, 1903 - 1950) foi um importante e influente autor inglês do século XX. Entre seus livros mais famosos estão este 
1984
 e 
A revolução dos bichos
 (Animal Farm).Orwell escreveu o livro em 1948 e o situou em um futuro longínquo (1984). Ou pelo menos assim parecia então, pois 36 anos é um tempo razoável, seria como um futuro imaginado em 2016 para 2052, parece longe. A mudança de posição dos dois algarismos parece ser um indicador de que estaria também se referindo ao seu próprio tempo.Podendo ser considerada como um clássico da distopia e até na ficção científica, entre outras coisas, a obra é principalmente uma sátira política, que critica com veemência os mecanismos de poder e os regimes totalitários. O mundo acabara de derrotar uma ditadura terrível, a da Alemanha nazista, mas ainda enfrentava outra tão ruim quanto, o da União Soviética comunista que, ao fim da II Guerra Mundial, dominou todo o leste europeu.No livro, o regime totalitário alcançou a perfeição, domina tudo. Por meio de telas, um certo líder, o “Grande Irmão”, que inclusive deve ser idolatrado, vigia a todos, o tempo todo. Note-se que em 1948 não havia sequer televisão, muito menos telas de computador, tablets e celulares. É conhecida a história de que, no regime soviético, quem caía em desgraça era removido de referências e mesmo de fotografias (coisa fácil hoje para qualquer usuário de Photoshop, mas artesanal na época). Na ditadura do livro, o sistema já está muito adiante: todos são treinados para repensar tudo o tempo todo, é o “duplipensar” (doublethink, no original), a verdade passa a ser aquela que é determinada a cada momento. Por sinal, existe um Ministério da Verdade. A própria língua é reestabelecida permanentemente, é a newspeak, traduzida para ""novafala"" ou ""novilíngua"", conforme a edição. E o mundo foi reduzido a três países, Oceania, Eurásia e Lestásia, que estão aliados ou em guerra entre si - mas isto também muda a cada momento.O futuro remoto chegou, e já se passaram mais quase outros 36 anos depois de 1984. E o mundo, como está? Se formos ver, a vigilância sobre os cidadãos atingiu níveis inimagináveis. As telas e câmaras de vigilância se multiplicam, e isto em regimes que nem são totalitários. E de onde você acha que tiraram o nome do tal programa de TV em que todos são vigiados o tempo todo? O regime de Orwell avisava pela “teletela”: “O Grande Irmão está de olho em você!” (“Big Brother is watching you!”).1984 entra em qualquer lista de grandes livros a serem lidos. Foi um sucesso de vendas no lançamento em 1949 e permanece assim quase setenta anos depois. Esta edição da Companhia das Letras, por exemplo, é de 2009 e, em seis anos, em 2015, já estava na 26ª reimpressão. Atualmente, a editora publica a obra de Orwell em português, em edições muito boas e atraentes, que contêm textos de apoio, sempre importantes para melhor compreensão da obra. Neste caso, três posfácios, de Erich Fromm (1961), Ben Pimlott (1969) e Thomas Pynchon (2003).Excelente leitura. Sempre atual, para pensar sobre limites de sistemas políticos. E uma obra impactante: ninguém deixará de se sentir atingido.Frases escolhidas de 1984:“Guerra é Paz.Liberdade é Escravidão.Ignorância é Força.”“Quem controla o passado controla o futuro. Quem controla o presente controla o passado.”“Cada registro foi destruído ou falsificado, cada livro reescrito, cada quadro foi repintado, cada estátua e edifício renomeados, cada data foi alterada. E o processo continua a cada dia, a cada minuto. A História parou. Nada existe exceto um presente sem fim no qual o Partido está sempre certo.”“O passado foi apagado, o apagamento foi esquecido, a mentira tornou-se verdade.”Veja mais informações:

1984
A Revolução dos Bichos"
2660,Elizabeth,"In my opinion this is the classic dystopian novel and the standard by which I compare all other books in this genre. It is frightening in a way that will destroy your belief in humanity because of its sheer honesty. But the scariest part is not the horrors this futuristic society inflicts on its citizens, but the moment when you realise you see the beginnings these attitudes in own society. 1984 contains an uncomfortable amount of fact embedded in its fictitious world.This novel is the a not casual bedtime reading book, because to read it requires a level of thinking that is difficult to reach without being fully awake. One of the themes is the necessity to control a person's mind in order to control the person themselves and this is done simply by inhibiting free thought and thus said person doesn't think. So I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes or wishes to think about humanity, society, power etc. Side note: If I ever wanted to take over the world 1984 would be my first choice for a handbook. "

2664,Daniel Guzman,"Excelente libro, una mirada particular a una distopia ambientada en Inglaterra donde se muestra la mas cruda expresión del poder, revelando cuan catastrófico puede ser cuando es ilimitado. Por otro lado exhibe sin tapujos una mirada a la verdadera naturaleza del hombre. Es interesante ademas porque define al liberalismo mostrando lo que no es. Lo recomiendo bastante."
2665,Rachel Brand,"Reread for EN4413: Reading the 1940s, 2011-2012.I loved this book - if it's possible to love such a bleak story. It reminded me a lot of Margaret Atwood's ""The Handmaid's Tale"", which I read when I was in high school and also adored. I thought that I'd given up quite early into this book but when reading it I remembered a lot more than I'd imagined and I think I only gave up about 3/4 of the way into the story when the main character reads the book he's been given. To be honest, I found this section hard to trudge through even on the second reading. I think my only displeasure with this book was the torture scenes, which I found very difficult to read. But I will admit that I'm a rather sensitive soul, perhaps too sensitive sometimes, and not everyone will have issues with this part. We debated a lot in my study group as to what the end of the book truly meant and none of us could really agree. Perhaps not as entirely relevant as it was in the 1940s but still provides a lot of food for thought. 9/10---First attempted to read in November 2006 but gave up.I attempted to read this book when I was fifteen but really struggled with it. I think the main problem was the time that I was trying to read it; I was on a work experience placement for school, and I kept trying to read this in my lunch breaks. But the other girls at the nursery would talk really loudly about the articles in their gossip magazines and it became really difficult to concentrate. Eventually, I had to return the book to the library before I was finished, but I shall go back and read it again someday as I was enjoying it."
2666,Daniel Clausen,"Long Live Ingsoc? Or Long After 1984 Big Brother Still WinsWarning: Drenched in Spoilers.Long after 1984 has come and passed, Orwell's book still remains relevant if a little dated. I was highly tempted to give this book four stars instead of five. In a way, the book has been outpaced by the times. What made me change my mind? Great details and a very riveting and appropriate ending—but also perhaps the notion that Ingos, Doublespeak, and Big Brother may be with us in ways we have yet to realize (see for example Hardt and Negri's Empire). Even though Fukuyama declared the End of History and made reference to the last man, we are left to wonder if liberal democracy really did “win” and whether there is not something strangely Ingsoc about our own time. After all, we continue to see examples of doublethink and doublespeak in our own politics and times—see for example the works of Derek Gregory and other Critical Geopolitics scholars. There is also no reason to believe that the conceits of domination through party rule are over. It seems to me that our postmodern times contain the seeds of many transformations including those that render us dominated by party or a kind of Big Brother. As I was reading this book, many people commented to me, “Didn't you read this book in high school?” Certainly, the book seemed a bit dated. After all, while I was reading it it seemed that I had read the book without ever having really read it. The words doublethink and doublespeak, to say nothing of Big Brother, were already familiar without having read the first page. The scenes and nomenclature of Orwell have been used a number of movies and TV shows from Star Trek to that weird gun Kung Fu movie with Christian Bale. I'm not sure if negative utopian books (Fromm's word, though wouldn't “dystopia” be more apt?) have really ever evolved beyond 1984. But even if the book is too familiar for most readers, it still did have a few surprises, especially at the end. Many of the political landscapes are familiar. We saw them in Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Soviet Union, and still see it today in Kim Jong Il's North Korea. But the details have an infinite ability to amuse. How can one ever forget a world where machines write novels as humans toil in fields. It is not until you hear O'Brien's rants and see the lengths the party goes to control the inner reality of a person that the book really earns its fifth star. The political philosophy of the book is also highly evolved: Orwell makes the bold claim that a socialist world will still have a proletariat and that despite our best wishes, they will not save us from corrupt oligarchies. The proletariat never revolt is the message throughout the book and even in the end, the author does not waver (sorry for the spoiler)!. It's also good that we arrive at the book in 1984 (though we cannot be sure of the time) and not later. As O'Brien explains later, Winston is the last man (though this is somewhat in dispute). Julia might be the “last man” as well—but she seems totally uninterested in understanding the system she rebels against, only the carnal pleasure of rebellion. One of the things that is essential for this book—the one area where you must sustain your disbelief at—is that there is a human at the center of it. In other words, there is someone who is not a product of Ingsoc or Party ideology. Eric Fromm's conclusion states, Orwell assumes that humans have something innate inside them that struggles for peace, justice, and liberty. Whether Orwell believed this or not—he probably did—it is absolutely essential for the novel. You have to care about poor Winston and his varicose ulcer. You have to feel his suffocation and long for freedom as he does. And you have to see his transformation at the end. In order for the book to work, there has to be things such as love and orgasms (O'Brien and the party of course have vowed to eliminate the orgasm). By the end of the book though, we are left to wonder if there will be anything left human to carry on a story in another ten years. After all, O'Brien calls Winston “the last man”. This of course may not necessarily be true, since O'Brien—and it is assumed other members of the inner party—are aware that there were once things that existed outside the party and the demands of Ingsoc. The end of the book reminded me very much of Shusaku Endo's Silence, perhaps because both books end with torture and the obliteration of a person's inner self. In that back too, the novel ends with the main character a shell of a person. One of his friends too is a shell of a character. Much like 1984 also, the main character is forced to work on a project which upholds the credos of a regime he doesn't believe in—in this case xenophobic tenets of Tokugawa Japan. It's not an easy thing to read, but if the author has done his work and made us care for the character, hope that he can somehow resist, then we endure the torture with him to a degree. "
2667,Anne Hawn Smith,"I read this in high school and remember thinking that 1984 was so far in the future it seemed impossible for some of the issues in the book to be relevant. It is amazing how many things have come true, or are comprehensible now. I think the border between ""political correctness"" and the concept of ""thought crimes"" is actually scary. I am also amazed at the role of the media. Until the last 20-25 years, the idea of a biased media was something I never thought I'd see. I remember talking in class about propaganda and thinking it couldn't happen here and now I am all too aware of ""interpretive journalism."" Once a country loses the objective voice of truth everything can be manipulated. 1984  isn't fanciful thinking, it is the natural extension of things that are taking place right now. Some have called our government a ""nanny states"" and the government in 1984 is a logical extension of that kind of thinking; ""Big Brother knows best""...and then ""Big Brother is watching."""
2668,Геллее Авбакар,"Disclosure:I get this nice edition from the well known website of Planet eBooks. It was a nice attempt to reach something that was impossible to reach during the hot Political days. I have it in PDF Form.My Plot:First of all, this not a real story that happens. It is just an Imagination of the world after the war the Orwell used to participate in. In fact it was all a world that consist of three powerful states. Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia. Our main focus lay on Oceania the country that was Ruled by the INGSOC the Abbreviation of English Socialism. Inside Oceania was the Protagonist Winston Smith. a functioned outer party member who used to work as a Rectifier in the Department of Records in the Ministry of Truth. Our Protagonist used to lead a life full of fears and hatred due to the constriction level that the INGSOC Party used to implement on its citizens. Oceania divided into three main social entities. Big Brother at the top followed by the Inner party Members followed by the Outer Party Member and finally the Proles who last the Social Pyramid. Anyway Winston was leading a normal life at the beginning of the story, until the day when he decided to write a diary to the future. It was obvious that the Citizens were forbidden from such a thing including writing diaries and Thinking of the pasts in addition to the falsification of the facts that the party said. Winston go against these norms as a rebellion, This fact annoyed the Inner Party member called O'Brien, and thus he pull the trigger saying to Winston that he ""will meet him in a Place where there is no Darkness."" Winston grows hasty with this statement. He get enthusiastic with O'Brien. Days past when he fall in love with Julia an outer party member, there meeting first began with Hatred toward her till he get the small paper saying ""I love You"". They pass some fine days together in a secret way. Winston lent a room in Mr. Charrington Junk shop. There he spent most of his time Julia. Until the date when they both met O'Brien, Winston shows an ardent feeling to get against the party and to rebel over it. O'Brien gave Winston a Falsified sort of the BOOK that Emmanuel Goldstein pretend to write. In fact Winston put a blind thrust toward O'Brien and that's what leads him to be arrested and tortured by the Taught Police in the Ministry of Love where O'Brien was his chief torturer. In the End Winston and Julia both got enough Torture and Winston had a brain wash. In the last Chapter Winston became a daily customer of the Chestnut Tree Café. he get another Job in the making of the Newspeak dictionary, Finally the shot him secretly and thus was the Finish line of the story.Positive and Negative Aspects:I would say that this story was the worst of all time. It was obvious that the INGSOC was somehow like an imitation of the Russian Socialist party during the Soviet Union. but the Laws used here in the book were exaggerated. People were deprived from thinking and from learning, from every aspect of good life. Besides it was unsuccessful attempt to imagine a party that was going to kill the sex instinct and the language as well. the INGSOC was trying to kill all the Human aspects of life and to make from the citizens as dog that do not dare to say anything front of the Party. Everything the party said is right and ineligible to be discussed. Besides falsifying the past was not something new to us. Indeed It was negative to imagine a world that will never stop from war. It was a Horror inside Horror but this time in an imaginative way, Another bad aspects inside the story, was the Chapters of Goldstein's book. It was a devastating to read a long meaningless Chapter that O'Brien deceived Winston's with. I read them and I feel a Headache inside my Head. Because it was a Book inside a Book. Finally It was meaningless too to read the last appendix of the Newspeak. because nothing is worth reading inside it but a minor Glimpse of how the party changed it language form.My Personal Reaction:Actually I wasn't fond of the story so much. Besides I was negatively impressed especially by the manner of Torture that the Ministry of Love used toward every convicted inside it. I expect George Orwell will deny any sort of torture but in fact he was teaching the world of how to implement these kinds of torture. I put a shame to the world, because much of the methods that are used by the party in the Book are used nowadays in the world of our Generation especially in the Arab world. where the King represent the Big Brother who can't get be reached to or he should not criticized, or so on and so forth. I was waiting from the writer to ban these forms of killing the human nature but he was otherwise reviving the weak instinct of Power inside every ruler today. The Death of Winston represent the status of human who want to live with mind and Logic. It was a nice symbolizing but a worse teaching for the other part. In another way I gave this book 5 stars just because of its literature attempt, but in fact the contents according to the Newspeak are DOUBLE PLUS UNGOOD.Recommendations:I don't recommend this book to anybody, Otherwise it should be banned, due to its negative teachings of such negative forms of life. It was a Book full of worst aspects of life and full of political problems. If someone read it I am sure he will get full of Intoxication. Without forgetting that this Book used to be Banned in several countries. All I would say is that for people who want to read it should care much of themselves by not implementing the methods of life used inside it. "
2669,Austin Roberts,"This was the first adult novel I ever read. I must have been 13 or 14, I had borrowed it from the library. I remember reading it and getting to the rough parts and looking around to make sure nobody was looking over my shoulder. It was the early part of the early decade of the century and as a young conservative american I was wading chest-deep in propaganda for the newly minted Iraq war that we were assured would clean up as nicely as the last one. The book resonated with me on a carnal level that I wasn't able to articulate quite yet, and I'm glad I read it - it sowed seeds in me about war and about modernity that made me much more critical about what was happening in my country and in the world. A remarkable and important book."
