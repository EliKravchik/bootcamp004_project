0,Lars Andersson,This is a very good book indeed. It sure will make you act in a different way! 
1,Ivy Zhang,incredible book. I am not a big fan a non - fiction. but I love this one.
2,Awdhesh Singh,"According to me, this is this the best book ever written on human relationship and communication skill. I must have read it several times and I always find something interesting every time. It may not appeal to people who are young and yet to see the realities of life, but for those who have flexible and mature mind, this book is not to be missed. However, you must never use the formula of the book because that will not work, if copied. The author provides an alternative thought that should be explored before you decide your action based on impulse or commonsense."
3,Leah,"It's an easy read with good principles to follow in any given situation. Some of it may seem like common sense, but it explains that common sense and why it is good to practice it. It will show you how to become a much better people person, even if you're not a people person to begin with. Read it! :-) "
4,Kyle Marsh,"Though it suffers from a bad title, which makes it sound somewhat malicious, I found this book to be just the kind of no-nonsense advice I needed for learning to be a conscientious and thoughtful person. It really helped me to consider the world from the other persons point of view - and was a major turning point in helping me create better relationships with those around me. "
5,Nathan Patrick,"loved the advice, really taught me better ways to interact with others and how to speak more respectfully; I wish the title were different as I find it to be a bit misleading - the book is not about manipulating others"
6,Tiffany Hatch,This should be required reading! Excellent!
7,Ahmed Afifi,it's a very good book 
8,David Grimaud,"I first read this book in ninth grade, and it influenced my whole personality and outlook on life."
9,Jānis Brikšis,A masterpiece and a must-read for everyone. Even if you are not a top notch Forbes 500 manager.
10,Ronald,"This is an excellent treatise on interpersonal relationships, and one that has stood the test of time. A simple, unpretentious book filled to the brim with social wisdom and packed with anecdotes. You could say that much of what is written herein is common sense, but if it is then we take it for granted because far too many people are lacking in good manner. If everyone made an effort to apply these principles in their daily lives then I have no doubt that the world would become an infinitely more pleasant place. Now, some people accuse Dale Carnegie of being shallow and manipulative, but I didn't get that vibe at all. In fact, he repeatedly makes a point of stating that you should not be reading his book if your intention is to take advantage of people. The core message is that to make a friend, you must first *be* a friend. Most of the book is spent discussing how to look at the good in every situation and become a friendlier and more polite individual, how to be a good listener, how to sympathize with the viewpoints of others, how to avoid causing unnecessary offense, conflict, etc.Still, there are two key things to remember when reading this book: One is that all interaction must be sincere and come from the heart, shallow flattery will only backfire on you (and the author says as much in the book); if you truly have nothing nice to say to a person, either be open about it or don't say anything at all. Be honest, not manipulative. The other thing to remember is that some people (a small minority) are just impossible to deal with regardless of how diplomatic you are and these principles only apply in full when interacting with someone of sound and sober mind; alcoholics, drug-addicts, paranoid schizophrenics etc. may have trouble appreciating and reciprocating your efforts at geniality (this little caveat is not mentioned in the book). That aside, I'm of the opinion that this is one of those rare gems that should be taught in public schools, and it's worth keeping a copy around the house."
11,Barb McDevitt,This book is something to keep around to read and re-read
12,Atalie,This book is one I like to revisit often! The teachings are timeless.
13,Andrea Kladar,"This book is one of the greatest classics of all time. It changes lives for the better as it's been doing for many decades, many different languages and many different countries around the work. A must read. "
14,Larry Basgall,A great treatise on how to communicate with people. Worth the read.
15,Bridgette Hannigan,I think that these principles can still be applied to today's culture. The information was very relevant to both business and personal relationships. I actually had this on audiobook and it was easy to follow.
16,Zarina Gore, A book must read ..
17,Abdullah M. M. S.,This is the most practical book in the art of dealing with people. I have used some of the techniques mentioned in this book. And they really work. I highly recommend this book for people out there who think they have a leader in them.
18,Reagan Ramsey,"My dad made me read this (God bless him) when i was in middle school...and it's amazing how much it has ""influenced"" me without my realizing it. I would encourage reading it a second time for those of you who read it years ago. Just simple, straightforward good sense. "
19,Mohamed Yosry Mohamed,One Word: Life Changing!
20,Alli Dalton,"Pretty much the basics on how to be a decent, kind human being"
21,Juraij Ibnu Rani,"""Human"" is the most complex living thing to understand. Everybody wearing a necklace says ""Make me feel importance""."
22,Jake Barrington,"Dale Carnegie fills his book with many interesting tid-bits and stories. He makes the book enjoyable to read while providing useful life lessons.Age Recommendation: 20+Suggested Audience: Anyone in Business, Politics, or anyone else wanting/needing to learn some good life lessons."
23,Ashley Curnutt,"This coupled with the teaching self-government skills taught in the building a house united book by nicholeen peck are so inspiring! I can parent without force, and heal relationships by changing me in the most Christlike ways! It really is me not you when it comes to success in dealing with people."
24,Mallie,Amazing! 
25,Josh Brown,Excellent book - I learned a lot about people and how they operate. I could read this 100 times and still find new things to apply.
26,Jennifer Ready,"Although you may think this book would be business-speak tripe, it was one of the best books I've ever read. It is full of obvious, common sense-type stuff, but the principles are things you don't spend a lot of time thinking about. I got so much out of this book that this was my second reading. I strongly suggest it to anyone and everyone."
27,Sherif ElHennawy,من الكتب التي اثرت في شخصيتي جدا. وانصح بقراءته 
28,Vinh Nguyen,It really influence me. Amazing
29,Hossam Al-Zahrani,أفضل كتاب قريته عن التعامل مع الناس، انقذني من أزمة
30,Paul,"Ignore the tittle, read the book. "
31,Asdf,Offers immense insight good stuff mate
32,Michelle Hoover,Another essential book for anyone who wants the ability to deal with people well. 
33,Kaan Kasım,"When you are reading the book you may think that it talks about obvious stuff. But these are the things pretty much all of us neglect to do, or just don't know how important they can be. All in all I enjoyed reading it, learned a thing or two and will try to apply some of those to everyday life. Maybe it'll help? Who knows, at least it was an interesting insight into human psychology."
34,Sallybeans,Great book that actually teaches you how to talk to people and be effective at it. A book that you constantly refer back to and constantly re-read. Recommend! 
35,Stef C,A classic must read for everyone who wants to get along with others!
36,Mitch,Amazing book that really opened my eyes to the way people can influence each other. I would say this is a must read for any decent human being. 
37,Matthew,Easily a five star read. This book should be read by everybody at least once. Maybe everyone should read it at least once a year!
38,Joshua Clement,"I absolutely loved this book. I didn't exactly know what to expect when picking this up but I had high hopes, and those hopes were greatly met. The book is emphasizes all the little things that you almost never think about when interacting with others. How To Win Friends... Is filled with common sense topics, yes, but in an age where sense isn't so common anymore it is a great read for anyone and everyone. "
39,Lee Whiting,A must read for everyone
40,Jacqui Daves,Everyone needs to read this book. Highly recommended!!!
41,Dmytro Savchenko,I honestly think everyone should read this book. 
42,Mohammed Alsharif,"Many ideas are well known to anyone, but what I liked that they are organized in principles and you can remember them and apply them to any situation. I liked the way of telling stories to explain each principle. "
43,Kaarthik Anebou,This book will be a good start to change your attitude towards people - & if you do the results are amazing!
44,Bryn Donovan,"I picked this book up because it's been in print for about eighty years, and I wanted to know why. Here's why: it's brilliant, and it might change your life.The title suggested to me that it might have a lot of sneaky tricks to try to get ahead. The book is actually more about being a decent human being, with success being one likely positive outcome. It could just as well have been titled, Have You Tried Not Being a Self-Involved Jackass?I found the first chapter, about how absolutely pointless it is to criticize people, to be particularly provocative. I try not to criticize much, but I could still do it less. I loved this passage:""Do you know someone you would like to change and improve? Good! That is fine. I am all in favor of it. But why not begin on yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable than trying to improve others--yes, and a lot less dangerous.""Carnegie is a clear and persuasive writer who uses anecdotes to good effect. His chapter titles read like modern clickbait article titles (for instance, ""If You Don't Do This, You Are Headed For Trouble."") It's an engrossing read, and I'm already finding opportunities to put the principles of his book into practice."
45,"Nikki ""The Crazie Betty"" V.","This is an absolutely timeless and fabulous read. Dale Carnegie truly was a man ahead of his time and I feel so grateful to get the opportunity to learn his teachings through this book. There are so many passages that I have copied from this book and hung on the walls of my cubicle area at work, I love looking up and reading them to remind me of those things I'm working on.Although I use these principles in my work life I find I use them much more in my personal life. Especially when dealing with silly little disagreements, where I would normally argue how I'm right regardless of how it is affecting other people. Reading this book really helped me to recognize that automatic response to argue and prove our points so that I'm able to refrain from such behavior when it isn't even remotely necessary.This is a book that is meant to be read multiple times. So much great information that you'll never retain it all in one read.Highly recommended!!!!"
46,Sally,"I first read this book years ago when I took a management position. Even though I quickly decided that management was not for me, I have re-read this book over and over. The principles make sense and I have had success with them. The problem for me is that I keep slipping back into my old ways, so I need a refresher."
47,Asiel,This is an amazing classic. If I could follow even half of the lessons from this book consistently I would be a much better person. I try to re-read this one every year or so to remember what I need to continue to improve on.
48,Nattaya,Powerful. Good for everyone. 
49,Hemn Khalaf,"Warren Buffett which owns almost 67 billion USD remarked in his book (Warren Buffett's Management Secrets) that he began with this book (How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie) and later on it became his ""Bible""... the natural and universal truth about dealing with people can be found in this book ... nobody could and can live alone, but with others ... it is about the ""how"" whom we are dealing with..."
50,Ralph Apilado,"All time classic, If the readers are having a hard time talking to other people the book is a must read."
51,Stephanie,"A must read for not only entrepreneurs, business owners, network marketers, but everybody!!!!"
52,Estevo Raposo,"La edición que tengo del libro de [author= Dale Carnegie] lleva impreso en la portada “22.000.000 de ejemplares vendidos”, y se puede definir como un manual de las relaciones personales. Un título más adecuado al que tiene sería el de “Como tratar a la gente”. No contiene formulas mágicas, ni grandes secretos, si no solo mucho sentido común. Su contenido se estructura en cuatro partes:Técnicas fundamentales para tratar a los demásSeis maneras de agradar a los demásLogre que los demás piensen como ustedSea un lider:como cambiar a los demás sin ofenderlos ni despertar resentimientos."
53,Angie,Everyone should read this book!
54,Dominique,"Excellent read. The principles seem like common sense until you hear them applied in the examples. If you want to be a more effective leader, this is a must read."
55,Tony Guo,"The lessons may seem basic, but the practical applications and Cargenie's overall positivity make this a great read."
56,Rodrigo Bacila,"Incrivelmente útil e extremamente revelador. Uma ferramenta de defesa e ataque indispensavel sobretudo para executivos, politicos e outros profissionais que dependam de relações interpessoais para o seu sucesso"
57,Andre,"""Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain - and most fools do"""
58,Jermajesty,"I was skeptical, but this book really is a classic. The grand-daddy of all self-help/management book seems just as sage today as I'm sure it did 80 years ago (!!).It's basically about the art of the soft sell- psychological judo for handling people, using their own psychology to change their behavior rather than taking them on by blunt force.A terrific, fascinating book."
59,Kariuki Njiru,"I have had a long reluctance to read this book owing to its title. A book on how to influence people seems like an advert made by a snake oil salesperson intended to sell something even more sinister. However this book turns out to be a great delight and quick read. Dale Carnegie offers advice that is neither sinister or pretentious. It does not offer tips on manipulation as most books of similar titles would. The book though lacks any research, that usually characterises modern books on social psychology but makes up for it by offering a healthy dose of anecdotes. It is important to note the anecdotes are of characters set in a different era.This book should be a recommended reading for everyone, even more so if you suffer from any form of social anxiety."
60,B G,"A fantastic journey into the human psyche. If you wanna know how to better get along with people, read this book. Eighty years later and it this has valuable wisdom."
61,Fany Wedahuditama,One of great books... must read... it will change how you see other people..
62,Sokunna,This book is very helpful. It helps us to open up our mind and understand others more. 
63,Momus,"A really wonderful book that inspires and encourages.Hundred short stories exemplify a few principles that one can use to life a more fulfilled life, to become a better listener, friend, partner or boss.Everyone, how well mannered he or she might be, could benefit studying this book and apply its suggestions.Those thirty principles separated in four categories might sound very obvious and too simple; this is their strength! As they dont intimidate the reader, but encourages to go out into the world and apply them, test them in the real world. "
64,Susie Shy, My motivational and inspirational book ! 
65,Gil Michelini,"This was the first personal development book I ever read. Just after I started in the direct selling business, my manager suggested I read this to help my issues with getting along with people. The results were amazing! While I am still not the best in many social settings, I understand myself better and how people think."
66,Jen,This book has wonderful advice on how to be a better person.
67,Rocky Rojas,"Characters: 4.     How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie remains an informational text; therefore, none of the characters have more influence on the book than others. With that being said, Carnegie is able to describe the characters fully and in detail. As he included Andrew Carnegie in one of his arguments, for instance, he wrote about his background by stating, ""Andrew Carnegie, the poverty-stricken Scotch lad who started to work at two cents an hour and finally gave away $365 million..."" (Carnegie 32). The author managed to introduce readers to persons they may have known nothing about, yet his descriptions allow readers to form opinions about Andrew Carnegie and his past. I truly enjoyed reading about the diverse characters Carnegie includes in this book, in that they each have a story that relates to forming better relationships in life. In many instances throughout the book, the characters eventually end up changing in one way or another because of a key concept described in the book. Specifically, a man named Ken Nottingham, an employee of General Motors altered his approach to addressing people as he is quoted relating, ""The only difference was I noticed her name tag. I smiled and said, 'Hello Eunice,' and then told her what I wanted"" (Carnegie 78). Nottingham found that straying from his normal life habits benefited him by relating to a woman who was serving his food. Language: 5     In this informational text written by Carnegie, his language throughout the book can be described loose and free-flowing. In other words, Carnegie's language is not restricted to orthodox approaches in formal writing. The language remains heterodox, for instance, when Carnegie uses questions to appeal to readers as he relates, ""Could my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or merit in their position or argument?"" (115). The author's use of interrogatory statements affects the overall language of the book as it creates a mild mood. As Carnegie's tone remains persistent, yet considerate, his language enables readers to connect with the text as he portrays himself as having problems with human relations similar to many other people. A clear example of the role slang plays in the text is revealed as when Carnegie writes, ""...the name will work magic as we deal with others"" (79). The implication of magic playing a role in the situation is not in fact meant to be translated literally, yet its point is evident as a reader knows it means a benefit is to follow. When reviewing language throughout the book as a whole, it is quite effective in terms of relating the main idea. Carnegie's smart choices in language do not go unnoticed when he directly addresses readers by writing, ""In preparation for this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions"" (115). In this excerpt, Carnegie specifically addresses readers as his loose language includes the use of ""yourself"" to empower the reader. Naturally, language plays a major role in the effectiveness of an informational book, and Carnegie managed to appeal to readers through the use of entertaining, unconventional language. Information: 5.      The main topic as described in detail by Carnegie remains finding and applying methods to better relate to people throughout one's life. To clarify, the techniques within the book are meant to guide readers in forming healthy interactions and relationships. In particular, Carnegie offers effective information as he explains the importance of a smile by conveying, ""Especially when that someone is under pressure from his bosses, his customers, his teachers or parents or children, a smile can help him realize that all is not hopeless─that there is joy in the world"" (69). Carnegie relates the imapct a single smile can have on a person, which provides useful information for a reader who might feel obligated to help someone find joy in their life. The book could not have been written as a story with a plotline in that Carnegie's points are categorized into four distinct sections about human relations with no chronology to other examples. The impossibility of a plotline in Carnegie's book is evident while he explains how the information for the book was obtained by relating, ""I read everything that I could find on the subject─everything from newspaper columns, magazine articles, records of the family courts, the writings of the old philosophers and the new psychologists. Clearly Carnegie could not have imagined a chronoligical method to provide structure to his points because they stand as historical facts and information. Theme(s): 4     The author's main message as clear after reading the informative text, remains the idea that problems occurring within human relationships can be improved through the use of techniques designed to appeal to a person's feelings and motives. To clarify, Carnegie reveals this theme through real-life examples of where these fundamental concepts are utilized to improve relationships. Specifically, he provides an explanation on the negative effects arguing has on relationships as he relates, ""I not only had made the storyteller uncomfortable, but had put my friend in an embarrassing situation"" (Carnegie 110). By describing his first-hand encounter with argumentation, Carnegie realized there were better methods available for approaching another person than by arguing. With that being said, the book is really about uncovering ways to better oneself from a moral standpoint. In particular, Carnegie states the extent to which many people have become self-concerned by explaining, ""We are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob us of their companionship"" (119). As he refers to a person's inability to change, Carnegie reveals the main idea behind the book in that one must strive to better their interaction with others by first improving their own flaws. Additionally, the title of the book hints at the theme as it refers to making friends and having a greater influence on others. The importance of the title is explored as Carnegie writes, ""The survey revealed that health is the prime interest of adults─and their second interest is people: how to understand and get along with people..."" (xvii). By including this statement in the text, Carnegie supports the relevance of the title and overall message of the book that a prime concern in a person remains their desire to be important as well as influential from a social perspective.Personal Response:      This book was truly interesting and helpful to read, as I enjoyed learning the numerous techniques that can be used to better communicate with others. Particularly, I am hoping to apply many of the concepts that are explored in my everyday life. Additionally, Carnegie wrote the book in such an effective way, and his examples remain very easy to interpret. I would absolutely recommend this book to a friend in that it can provide him or her with valuable knowledge they might not have ever come across before. By and large, How to Win Friends and Influence People is a phenomenal informational text with many valuable tips on how to improve one's social life and live more freely amongst others."
68,Casey,All of the recommendations in this book seem like common sense when you're reading it! But a bit harder in practice. :-) Great and easy read.
69,Juno,"This book should be read by everyone. It is full of important information that everyone can benefit from. Its most important feature is its combination of well formulated principles and carefully selected life stories. These stories well illustrate the principles and also make the book very interesting to read. Its style is like ""tell stories, make a point"". I was really surprised as to how much this book matters and how much I learned by reading it. Yes, some of the advice may be obvious, but it brings the correct way in which to interact with others to the forefront of the mind and that's why it's so valuable."
70,Yusef Trowell,"As corny as the title might sound, this book should be a must-read on everyone's list. After reading this book I am surprised that schools do not teach the simple principles/methods for youth to get along with each other and have less conflict. This book is a classic and I believe it has stood the test of time. The information provided works just as well today as it did when it was written some 70 years ago. What motivated people 70 years ago still motivates them today. What worked on making friends and influencing people 70 years ago still works today. Any person going into any sort of business must read this. The advice this book provides is more applicable than a college education on business (IMO). While reading this book, I have already had a lot of success, whether it's dealing with colleagues, friends, or family. This book was enjoyable and easy read."
71,Manuel Valencia Restrepo,"Este libro necesita que le pongan un nombre distinto. Algo así como: Recomendaciónes básicas de como tratar con personas.De entrada este libro parece que fuera de superación personal y todos los que no se lo hayan leído van a pensar que lo es hasta que se lo lean.Para spoilear un poco, en el prólogo aclaran que este libro es producto de una investigación social acerca del segundo campo, después de la salud, sobre el cual los adultos más desean aprender: Lidiar con personas.Es probablemente el libro más revelador que me haya leído pero curiosamente es revelador de unas verdades muy evidentes y accesibles. O Yo me volví fanático de esta secta, o realmente es útil."
72,I Read,"Valuable advise that can help in both career and personal life. A 'does what it says on the tin' book! The techniques can be understood and put into practice easily, but as Carnegie warns, what a person will get out of his book depends entirely on the effort and commitment they dedicate to the practices explained.I felt the chapters were just the right length to get the points across and give real life examples where they have been successfully implemented to encourage the reader without it getting tedious or feeling like they are being lectured. The only issue I had with it was that the view of all humans was very cynical; that we are all egotistical and selfish, which of course isn't always the case (though perhaps true 95% of the time!). "
73,Jeff Wilson,Excellent book on relationships and getting along with people. I read it a few years back and listened to it as well. Very sound advice...especially for those who have a tendency to drive people away from them by their actions and their words. I really like the advice from this book.
74,Charity,"Fantastic listen, fantastic brainstorming. Wish I owned this and could pop it in for a refresher from time to time. Anecdotes are timeless. Can't believe I never ""read"" this before."
75,Christina,Great practical advice. Easy read. Will definitely reread. 
76,Miguel Manzanares,"A very good reading. It shows basic guides to: treat with others, to be likeable, to be persuasive and to be a motor to change behaviors and get people focussed in the accomplishment of punctual objectives.Highly reccomended to everyone, as everyone has to treat with others, but specially to business people, sales persons or managers"
77,Christine,Despite of being an old book but it covers alot of tips that will lead you to handle people successfully especially in the business world. Very interesting for people who are willing to develop their interpersonal skills! 
78,Mohamad Fakih,A classic...
79,Sabera,It's an amazing book indeed. And also I am writing my first review for any book ever. I was depressed thinking what is wrong with me. It made me to think actually what is wrong with others! Why they do what they do! It made me learn how to look at the life from a different perspective. Author tried to make the reader to understand the psychology of the other people. But besides these I have understood the psychology of mine when I had lost 'myself' for a long time.
80,Paul G,"This is a very practical, general common sense guide for interpersonal behavior of all kinds. Like all books of this kind, it's not a miracle cure, and some of the suggestions would only have limited effectiveness in the present day. It is nevertheless a quick and extremely insightful read. I recommend this book to everyone who's never read it, and I'll definitely read it again. "
81,James Affleck,"This book is great. It teaches you how to get along with people better, and how to be less selfish in conversation. Everyone should read it."
82,Eric De Feo,"Nothing revolutionary here, but the point of reading it (or listening to it on audio as I did) are the important reminders about listening and paying attention to the interests of others. Even though the anecdotes are from many years ago, they could not be more relevant especially in the digital age. "
83,Lucio Diaz,very useful
84,Thomas K,Often imitated never duplicated!
85,Chad Reinhard,"Amazing book to help you with people. I enjoyed the ""do this"" and ""don't do this"" sections. Very straight forward."
86,Newmy Fumes,"All time classic. The ideas expressed in this book are timeless. This book can literally transform your life as you realize that most of the things Carnegie talks about are very true. It helps you in interacting with people, and developing new relationships. I would recommend this book to anyone."
87,Alsicia Pringle,This book is a must read for anyone who is into Networking. This book gives lots of useful information that can help with understanding the nature and the art of meeting people. The information is good to read and also good to know.
88,Adrian Blanco,Carnegie approach simple and common sense
89,Jered Schock,read and re-read many times. sooooo much good stuff in here.
90,Richard Shulmistra,Great book! Timeless! I read it about 10 years ago and use the principles....will re-read it again.
91,Oscar Romero,"It amazes me how the exact same book can arouse so many different feelings in all of us. Some people like it so much--they are quite surprised about a simple book written so long ago. While others are so sickened by it--they take the time and trouble to write and let everyone know-not to read this book-- in an attempt to of course, saving them their valuable time. Well...here are my two cents:I love this book and its contents…..and I like it more each time I read it.I definitely can say that this book affects me different according to my own life experiences--If I have been in the giving end or the receiving end--I definitely can connect with all of these recommendations and I agree totally as to why we should do it….it sure makes sense to me, I can see why.What is hard is to practice it—My own nature comes up first and I tend to respond too quick without thinking it through and how that action may come back to me, like a homing pigeon, eventually. Just as when I say something that I regretted right after I said it.I think you should read it (few times) and make your own opinion—so; go ahead and get it and read it. I am telling you; you will love it....maybe!"
92,Gregorius Gerry Purnomo,"If I only can recommend one book to you, I will definitely recommend this book. How to Win Friends & Influence People should be read by all people. It teaches us the basic of human relationship: how to make friend with others. Some good quotes from the book:“You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.” “Any fool can criticize, complain, and condemn—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.” "
93,Jacob Seymour,Invaluable. Must-read. Magical. Effective. I loved this book. I intend to re and re-read this without end. Don't pick it up unless if you have a desire or are interested in getting a desire to be better with people. A big desire. A burning one. And you must be willing to apply it. I frequently found myself excited when I finished a chapter because I'd immediately try it and more times than not it worked! Wonderfully!
94,Sara,no book was more useful to me than this book.my relationship with people improved a lot because of applying its theories or recommendations.i wish everybody read it.
95,Ralph,"A must read for everyone, for all walks of life. The book really impressed Luke."
96,Jerry,The BEST business book ever written...by far !!
97,Brian,"For anyone in Sales or in busuiness, you have to read this."
98,Denise Foppiano,Great book but following the advice is a lot harder than just reading the book.
99,Dylan Soule," The best book I've ever read to date, hands down. How to Win Friends and Influence People details the essential guidelines of effective Human Relations. Every paragraph uses real life examples of the principles in practice to be used as evidence of the principle's effectiveness. One of the principle's in this book was under the chapter ""How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking"" and it was to try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view. ""There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret out that reason—and you have the key to his actions, perhaps to his personality."" This quote is one of the many key points in this book that was able to alter my state of mind on how I treat people.  I learned that success is easier to achieve when you are able to manipulate your relations with other people by speaking in a way that the other person has no choice but to like you. Even when you are at fault, admitting that you are wrong opens the door to an unpredictable amount of respect. While Charles Schwab may not be a role model, his approach in dealing with people sets the standard as an example of how far human relations can take you in life."
100,David D'angelo,How to Win Friends and Influence People is probably the most important book I've ever read. Invaluable advice for your personal life and professional career. This book was first published in 1936 and its principles and techniques for handling people are absolutely applicable today. This is the type of book you can reread every month to keep sharp.

102,Renee shi yan Liu,"It is not really a how-to book, but rather, it is a book poking deeply into human nature."
103,Jessica Rounsaville,I love this book. I've listen to it on audio a couple times and you can always learn something new from Mr. Carnegie. It's great at inspiring and motivating you to do better at life and think about the way you interact with others.
104,Liz,Classic - helps you to understand people more.
105,Chris Coccaro,"Despite the economic downturn of the Great Depression, Dale Carnegie made millions selling his ideas on personality and human communication to business people nationwide. He sold out halls and toured all over the country teaching executives and managers how to manage and lead. By documenting his techniques he immortalized his lessons, told over 200 easy pages in anecdotes and stories from his classes and experiences. If you can get over the fact that there isn't a single Ipad or computer mentioned anywhere (this was the 30s, after all) there's something to learn on every page. Even if you're not in a position of power you can use these techniques in your every day life to improve your social standing. I picked up this book expecting a lot of hot air but I found myself nodding and agreeing with a lot of what Dale had to say. I continue to be surprised by not only his insight and ability to read people, but also by the application of his 100 year old ideas. I would suggest this book to anyone aiming to improve their social skills.Please note - introverts may disagree with a lot of what is written here. After reading Susan Cain's ""Quiet"", a seeming counterpoint to Carnegie's heavy wielding extrovert ideals, you can begin to see a world where it makes sense that not everyone is a guns cocked conversation cowboy. I do think there are strengths to each type of person though. On the subject: ""Don't Criticize, condemn or complain""...B. F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior. Later studies have shown that the same applies to humans. By criticizing, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment. 5.And when Mrs. Lincoln and others spoke harshly of the southern people, Lincoln replied: ""Don't criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances. 15. Instead of condemning people, let's try to understand them. Let's try to figure out why they do what they do. That's a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness...As Dr. Johnson said: ""God himself, sir, does not propose to judge a man until the end of his days."" Why should you or I? 16.On the subject: ""Giving honest and sincere appreciation""...The only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what you want. 17.Dr. John Dewey said that the deepest urge in human nature is ""the desire to be important"". 17.William James said: ""The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated."" He didn't speak, mind you, of the wish or desire or the longing to be appreciated. He said the craving to be appreciated. 18.The desire for a feeling of importance is one of the chief distinguishing differences between mankind and the animals. 18.""There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise."" - Charles Schwab. 23.On the subject: ""Arouse in the other person an eager want""...The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition. 42.On the subject: ""Become genuinely interested in other people""...Yet I know and you know people who blunder through life trying to wigwag other people into becoming interested in them. Of course, it doesn't work. People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves-morning, noon and after dinner. The New York Telephone Company made a detailed study of telephone conversations to find out which word is the most frequently used. You have guessed it: it is the personal pronoun ""I""...It was used 3,900 times in 500 telephone conversations. 52.""It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring."" - Alfred Adler. 53.""We are interested in others when they are interested in us."" - Publilius Syrus. 61.On the subject: ""Smile""...""Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.Thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there.."" - William James. 67.Thought is supreme. Preserve a right mental attitude - the attitude of courage, frankness, and good cheer. To think rightly is to create. All good things come through desire and every sincere prayer is answered. We become like that on which our hearts are fixed. Carry your chin in and the crown of your head high. We are gods in the chrysalis. 69.On the subject: ""A person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language""...Half the time we are introduced to a stranger, we chat a few minutes and can't even remember his or her name by the time we say goodbye. 77.""Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices"" - Ralph Waldo Emerson. 78.On the subject: ""Being a good listener and encouraging others to talk about themselves""...That kept her talking for forty-five minutes. She never again asked me where I had been or what I had seen. She didn't want to hear me talk about my travels. All she wanted was an interested listener, so she could expand her ego and tell about where she had been. 80.""Few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention."" - Jack Woodford. 81.Many people fail to make a favorable impression because they don't listen attentively. 87.Lincoln hadn't wanted advice. He had wanted merely a friendly, sympathetic listener to whom he could unburden himself. That's what we all want when we are in trouble. That is frequently all the irritated customer wants, and the dissatisfied employee or the hurt friend. 87.Remember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems. 88.On the subject: ""Make the other person feel important, sincerely""...If we are so contemptibly selfish that we can't radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return - if our souls are no bigger than sour crab apples, we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve. 95. One of my favorites.On the subject: ""The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it""...I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument - and that is to avoid it. Avoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes. 110.A man convinced against his willIs of the same opinion still.111.""If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent's good will."" - Benjamin Franklin. 112.""Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love,"" - Buddha... and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person's viewpoint. 113Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite. 113.""My wife and I made a pact a long time ago, and we've kept it no matter how angry we've grown with each other. When one yells, the other should listen - because when two people yell, there is no communication, just noise and bad vibrations."" - Jan Peerce. 115.On the subject: ""Show respect for other's opinions""...There's magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: ""I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let's examine the facts."" 118.Few people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and biased. Most of us are blighted with preconceived notions, with jealousy, suspicion, fear, envy and pride. And most citizens don't want to change their minds about their religion or their haircut or communism or their favorite movie star. So, if you are inclined to tell people they are wrong, please read the following paragraph every morning before breakfast:""We sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any resistance or heavy emotion, but if we are told we are wrong, we resent the imputation and harden our hearts. We are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob us of their companionship. It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us, but our self-esteem which is threatened...The little word 'my' is the most important one in human affairs, and properly to reckon with it is the beginning of my wisdom. It has the same force whether it is 'my' dinner, 'my' dog, and 'my' house, or 'my' father, 'my' country, and 'my' God. We not only resent the imputation that our watch is wrong, or our car shabby, but that our conception of the canals of Mars, of the pronunciation of 'Epictetus,' of the medicinal value of salicin, or of the date of Sargon I is subject to revision. We like to continue to believe what we have been accustomed to accept as true, and the resentment aroused when doubt is cast upon any of our assumptions leads us to seek every manner of excuse for clinging to it. The result is that most of our so-called reasoning consists in finding arguments for going on believing as we already do."" - James Harvey Robinson. 119.I am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished and a lot of damage can be done if you tell a person straight out that he or she is wrong. You only succeed in stripping that person of self-dignity and making yourself an unwelcome part of any discussion. 124.On the subject: ""Begin in a friendly way""...""If you come at me with your fists doubled I think I can promise you that mine will double as fast as yours; but if you come to me and say, 'Let us sit down and take counsel together, and, if we differ from each other, understand why it is that we differ, just what the points at issue are,' we will presently find that we are not so far apart after all, that the points on which we differ are few and the points on which we agree are many, and that if we only have the patience and the candor and the desire to get together, we will get together."" - Woodrow Wilson. 135.If a man's heart is rankling with discord and ill feeling toward you, you can't win him to your way of thinking with all the logic in Christendom. Scolding parents and domineering bosses and husbands and nagging wives out to realize that people don't want to change their minds. They can't be forced or driven to agree with you or me. But they may possibly be led to, if we are gentle and friendly, ever so gentle and ever so friendly. 137.The sun then told the wind that gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force. 142.""A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall."" - Abraham Lincoln. 143.On the subject: ""Get the other person saying 'yes, yes' immediately""...The Chinese have a proverb pregnant with the age-old wisdom of the Orient: ""He who treads softly goes far."" They have spent five thousand years studying human nature, those cultured Chinese. 149.On the subject: ""Let the other person do a great deal of the talking""...La Rouchefoucauld, the French philosopher, said: ""If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you.""Why is that true? Because when our friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them, they - or at least some of them - will feel inferior and envious. 154.On the subject: ""Let the other person feel that the idea is theirs""...""In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty."" - Ralph Waldo Emerson. 158.""The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, putteth himself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury."" - Lao-tse. 159.On the subject: ""Be sympathetic with other people's ideas and desires""...""Sympathy the human species universally craves. The child eagerly displays his injury; or even inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap abundant sympathy. For the same purpose adults...show their bruises, relate their accidents, illness, especially details of surgical operations. 'Self-pity' for misfortunes real or imaginary is, in some measure, practically a universal practice."" - Arthur I. Gates. 174.On the subject: ""Appeal to the nobler motives""...""A person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one."" - J. Pierpont Morgan. 175.We are either men or monkeys - and the choice usually lies with ourselves. 176.You may be right. Nothing will work in all cases - and nothing will work with all people. If you are satisfied with the results you are getting, why change? If you are not satisfied, why not experiment? 177.On the subject: ""Throw down a challenge""...""All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory"". - King's Guard, ancient Greece. 187.On the subject: ""Your own mistakes""...It isn't nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the person criticizing begins by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from impeccable. 204.On the subject: ""Let the other person save face""...Letting one save face! How important, how vitally important that is! And how few of us ever stop to think of it! We ride roughshod over the feelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing threats, criticizing a child or an employee in front of others, without even considering the hurt to the other person's pride. Whereas a few minutes' thought, a considerate word or two, a genuine understanding of the other person's attitude, would go so far toward alleviating the sting! 211.Even if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face. The legendary French aviation pioneer and author Antoine de Saint-Exupery wrote: ""I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime."" 214.On the subject: ""Praise the slightest and every improvement""...The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life. 219.""Compared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use."" - William James. 219.On the subject: ""Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to""...""The average person can be led readily if you have his or her respect and if you show that you respect that person for some kind of ability."" - Samuel Vauclain. 222.On the subject: ""Outro. Teaching masses on dealing with people""...The fact that these people, ten or twenty years after leaving grade school, high school or college, come and take this training is a glaring commentary on the shocking deficiencies of educational system. 238.Dale Carnegie would tell you that he made a living all these years, not by teach public speaking - that was incidental. His main job was to help people conquer their fears and develop courage. 247."
106,Donna,This book helps me everytime I read it.
107,Jennifer Wortham,One of the most important books in my library. I never stop reading this book. I finished another read-through recently. It never ceases to amaze me how a refresher in Carnegie can improve the ways i interact with others. 
108,Tamra,"I read this book many, many years ago. I am now old enough that I can say, ""many, many years ago."" Anyway, and over the years I've read different parts. I think it's a really good book. Especially for times like now, where everyone seems to be so self absorbed and wanting to get your attention and time to talk about themselves. Everyone could always use a little help on how to be a better conversationalist and how to make others feel comfortable around you. It also helps if you have a tendency to be shy. Which I have been and at times still am. I think it's good for any and everyone to read. I can especially think of some people who could REALLY, REALLy use it. I've had fantasy about anonomously sending this book to some people. Don't we all know folks like that:)"
109,Jordan,Excellent book. I wish I had read this a long time ago. It flows well with lots of advice and interesting stories to go with it. Everyone should have to read this book and have a copy in thier collection.
110,Jack,The chapter are short and to the point. The examples are very helpful and emphasize the points. Everything is clearly explained and makes for a great advice book.
111,Kat,"This is a wonderful book! Some of the examples are quite outdated, but they still beautifully illustrate interpersonal relationships. I really need to read this one again - I really kept feeling like 'This is truth!' when I was reading it the first time."
112,Gretchen,"I think the world would be a much better place if everyone read this. Yes, there are parts that are dated but the overlying theme is great."
113,Gabe Mounce,A must if you have to interact with people to achieve anything! 
114,Renee,"Must Read Book. Embarrassing title to carry around, but will make you a better person to be around. "
115,Dylan,9.8/10 - phenomenal read. the single best improvement/life&career enhancing book a person can read. the importance of top-notch communication in life can not be over-stated. 
116,Lucas,"Are you unliked by people? Do you have real difficulties in making people accept your suggestions and opinios? Then you have to read this book! If you don´t do it, than I didn´t learn how to convince people well. The book is still awesome, though."

119,Sammy,Love how the author uses real life examples to show how the theories can be applied to various situations. A must have for people who deal with people.
120,Carlos,"Lista de principios y reflexiones, con muchos ejemplos, para conseguir un trato más agradable y mejores relaciones con las personas.Uno de los imprescindibles para todos los públicos. Siempre hay algo que aprender y recordarnos a cambiar de nuestra personalidad."
121,Alexander Novicov,fantastic book! A must read book by everybody on this planet. ( of course if you want to communicate with others efficiently ) 
122,Shubham srivastava,must read book once in life but try to read as early as you can.
123,Sparks210786489 Cocuzza,I read this book over ten years ago and loved it so much I try to read it once a year. Michael got me the book on CD and I love it. I listen in the car and I always learn something new. Its wonderful because it applies to all aspects of life including home and work.
124,Jeffrey Pritchard,"Absolute classic on getting along with people. Some people claim that what Carnegie teaches is how to be dishonest. I didn't get that at all from this book. What he teaches to take an interest in other people. How to listen. How to reserve judgment. How to be a friend. In doing all these, you will earn influence. It's just a simple fact. I highly recommend this book for EVERYONE."
125,Quinn,Awesome book. Probably the best study of the way people react out there. It was a life changing book in the way in influenced the way I interact with others.
126,Veena,Amazing points to read and remember.I felt if we use these suggestions in our daily lives we will improve our communication and relationships.
127,Radhika,"An amazing book! The title isn't the most catchiest, but I would definitely recommend it to those who want to know how to survive in the real world! MUST read!"
128,Kerri Painter,I loved this book!! I would highly recommend this book. A great book about life lessons and how to be the best person you could be. 
129,Bruno Skvorc,"A book that tells you what you already know, but does so with examples and categories you can follow and apply in real life. While the content is somewhat dated (the book is almost 100 years old), that doesn't diminish its value - the examples within are of pure human interaction, and while naivette has dropped and resistance to some of the ""tricks"" within has grown over the course of the past century, the advice is mostly sound.Perhaps most importantly - the book is written in an amusing, friendly manner which makes you glide through it. It's readable in a weekend easily, so it's easy to follow the author's advice on re-reading it every month until the principles within are embedded in your very way of being."
130,Abdullah (Abu Rayan),"Amazing book, It is not just a book to read, it is more like a guide to follow for improving your relation with all types of people. a huge effort have been spent on gathering and forming all book's ideas from different successful people in that time. "
131,Constantin Minov,"I don't know why I have been putting this book away for a such long time. It is a well crafted classical worth reading. No descriptions needed, it is self explanatory."
132,Osiris Estrada,Top 5 books I've ever read. Probably top 3. Read every year
133,Nicolas Mondragon,"This book is a MUST!!!Absolutely one of the best books I've ever read. Easy to read, lot of examples and tons of tips for a better life and the best relationships. Give yourself this gift"
134,Ravi Shrivastava,Timeless & highly recommended.. Key takeaway: Always be genuine & truly interested in the other personThis is one self-help book that - in my humble opinion - really touches the issue at its core. Most other books talk about low level tactics but this one hits the point home - Always be genuine & truly interested in the other person.
135,bluevirgin23,keren! keren! keren!!!
136,Menna,"Dale Carneige, is a widely famous author. Even in Egypt, here, most of the HR seminars would have his books listed as a ""Resource"". So, I decided to give this book a try and see what comes up.What I really admired about this book, is how Dale at the beginning; provides you with tips about how to use this book and actually apply the concepts. This really captured my eye. It made me take the entire thing seriously.I have read the book a while ago, so I dont really remember the topics and how it was divided. But rest assured, that Dale covered most of the aspects of simply ""How to be nice to humans"". Honestly, it surprised me how simple the techniques he described, yet, I dont really practice them. I guess, being a selfish jerk could sometimes be easier than being the nice cool guy who accepts criticism by the face.All in all, I advise most people to give it a read. And I also, advise you to actually take his advise that is mentioned early in the book."
137,Alysha Johnson,"This was a good starter book for a socially awkward person like me. I don't follow it to a T, but the ones that I do remember, had helped me well in becoming a more social person. Some of my favorites are: take interest in others, stop thinking about what to say, be generous with compliments, and most importantly, be sincere. I can see how some might think this book can be manipulative, and it can be if that is the reader's intention. This book presents the tool, it is up to the readers on how to use these 'tools'. "
138,Gabriel ,"Obligatory, mandatory read. Simple tips to relationship"
139,Bobby,"One of the all-time best self-help books EVER!!! Mr. Carnegie had a real knack for winning over the reader with experiences and anecdotes, instead of the typical lecture being preached to you by some pompous know-it-all. I have read this at least a half-dozen times."
140,Jon Young,"The only thing I don't like about this book is perhaps its title, because people think it sounds like a cheap self-help book. And i can't blame the author for that. Everyone should really be intentional about improving their people skills, this book can help do that."
141,Thomas,Excellent book on interpersonal relationships. 
142,Gord Young,"Much has been written since this book on the topic of influence but nothing new.This book covers it all and in a very concise manner.Anyone, nay everyone, who would win friends and influence people should learn whatis taught in this book."
143,Bobbi,"I had the impression that this was one of those dime-a-dozen manager inspiration books until I saw it on a Reddit list titled ""the book that changed me most"" or something like that - and a bunch of people had agreed. So I decided to give it a shot. And I agree. I think everybody should read this, and it's a shame that the name itself has become a bit of a cliche. The content of this book is about getting along with and handling people - not gaining power or bending others to your will. It is full of advice pretty much everyone I know could use. "
144,Drjackman,"I thought this was an incredible book. I thought that I'd have to weed out a lot of antiquated advice, but I can't think of one principle or even story that was inappropriate for today. Much of the advice was stuff that I already knew, but put into context with the excellent concrete examples that he used has reinforced the basics of interpersonal relations."
145,Haim Cohen,"Published in 1937 for the first time, this book is still a pure gold. It contain what some would consider good old common sense, and reminds again and again from various aspects, a very important principle: No matter what we do, where we live, what business we are in, how the world looks like, or how far technology will advance - more than anything else, this is still a world of people."
146,ME TOO,A true self-help book for folks who actually can reflect on their own behavior and change. For those who can't don't waste your time as you will never change!
147,Ahmed Erfan,you have to read it at least once in your life ... :) best book ever 
148,Ruth Thompson,Everyone in the world should own this book and read from it regularly. Inspirational.
149,Aaron Zaccaria,"Indispensible for anyone looking to build a career in dealing with people - whether its sales, business, customer service. Probably one of the most enlightening books I have ever read, and the audiobook is superb as well. "
150,Adam Vine,"Nothing you don't already know, but it always helps to be reminded. "
151,Leo Tran,Recommended by my Mentor and this book is AMAZING!DEFINITELY A MUST READ!
152,Svetlio Blyahoff,The perfect book for improving your interpersonal relationship skills. Would definitely recommend it to all of my friends and colleagues. Applying even a bit of the principles in that book could potentially make you life a lot better and much more bearable. 
153,Matt Perrone,"You just can't beat this book in practicality. Everyone should take a college course, or maybe two, based on this book. The world would be a better place."
154,Joe Cafferty,Great read! I read some chapters more than once I liked it so much. I will probably continue to hold on to this book and read it time and time again.
155,John Sherif,One of the best books I've ever read!
156,Rajveer,"If you know me, you'll understand why I love this book so much. It's easy to read and littered with wonderful examples and stories about the application of Carnegie's principles. "
157,Lionel Ling,Unbelievably easy to read and apply. Remains a Classic still applicable today because we are only human.
158,Zabasha,"Simply, a must read. I don't think there is anyone on this planet who don't want read this. I mean subconsciously.It is very easy to read, light on the mind and effective in real life."
159,David Tendo,"Truly indispensible - whether you're a salesperson, businessman, teacher or just trying to relate to other people a bit better, this book truly does inspire and encourage diplomacy and amicability. It's even written in a easy-to-read-and -understand style so that you're able to process and remember the different techniques. The things I like most about the book is that he gives practical examples that we can all relate to, and then he gives a summarising principle at the end of each chapter. Definitely one of those books, like the Bible, that I can refer back to time and time again."
160,Stephen Cook,"This is the Alpha book of the genre. The style is typical of self help books written in the 1930s. This book, along with Think and Grow Rich, The Master Key System, and, The Power of Positive Thinking  defined the genre. Modern books always go back to these and the new authors may restate what Carnegie, Norman Vincent Peale, Napoleon Hill, and Charles Haanel wrote, but they seldom add any new information. Carnegie's work seldom dips into psychic phenomena as Hill and Haanel do, but focuses on the daily methods of genuinely taking an interest in people, and making your life better by making their lives better. I think these types of books are important, and try to read this one at least once a year. It reminds me of the importance of treating people with dignity and respect. It also gives me a little brighter outlook on the day. "
161,Abhishek Bakuli,its a very nice book
162,Faith,"This is one of those books you read over and over again. Worth the read. Definitely a must-read, in my opinion."
163,Adrienne Jacobs,I try to read this book (or listen to it) at least once a year because I'm still working on everything suggested in the book! Highly recommend this book to everyone age 12+
164,Rawan,هذا الكتاب وصلني هدية من زوج اختي:) كتاب جميل جداً وفعال، من ضمن اهداف الكتاب ان لا احد يهتم بما تريد انت ، لذلك عندما ترغب في اقناع مديرك مثلا بامر انت تريده حاول ان تتكلم عن ما يريده المدير، ابحث عن ما يثير اهتمام المدير في الامر الذي تريده ثم تحدث عنه من وجهة نظر المدير ..
165,Iuliia,Most usefull book on this topic I've read
166,Derek,"great book! one of my favorites, it really helps with the profession of sales but should be considered if you want to make better your own individual character."
167,Sandra Kerr,This is one of those books that never goes out of style. It lays on my nightstand and I often re-read a chapter before I go to bed.
168,Jeramy,One of the best books I have ever read - recommended to all open minded individuals who are interested in accomplishing what the title suggests.
169,Hajer  al-souli,كتاب ممتاز و أعجبتني أمثلته القصصية

176,William,"A book everybody should read, about relationships in general.It's not boring and really easy to read, since there are a lot of small stories and interesting facts in it.It's a book about ""what you should do and what you shouldn't do"" in every kind of relationships: friends, family, work, love, etc. It can help to have more smiling people around you (and to have more friends if you need so, but that's not mandatory), so I think it can help YOU to have a better life. It can help you to manipulate (or Influence, like the author say) everybody around you as well to do WHAT YOU WANT.Warning: It's not because you know what to do in life, that you will do it."
177,Montazar,"simple, easy enjoyable, It emphasis on many small things that we tend to forget and tell good stories on how to use it."
178,Jana Kaiser-johnson,"inspiring and helpful, liked it may reread it."
179,Aubrei,"All leaders, CEOs, and small business owners should read this book. I was introduced to this book in high school by my mother's best friend. It changed my outlook on people and their personalities. "
180,Josh Davis,Essential for anyone to read.
181,Tayway,"Outstanding book. To this day it still gives excellent advice. I was skeptical to read another ""self help"" book, but this was well worth it. One of my current favorites."
182,deborah trout,"Good bookthis is timeless good advice for anyone, in business or not. these principles will help everyone have a happier life by minimizing conflicts and promoting harmony. Good common sense."

189,Ariadna73,I applied all those advices and they were magic. I was a teenager then; and I felt so empowered for what I read; that it has been a unique experience in my life. I think that I read it at the right time of my life.
190,Tomadur Alamro,This book should be required reading for anyone who works with other people. I think I will force myself to re-read it again. 
191,Colin Pearce,"What did I think?Silly question:It's Dale Carnegie! – one of the most fundamental reads for anyone living in Western society where the culture has warped, the mores have morphed and the folkways have blended with the need to have, get, and own; stuff, reputation and money.I don't know why I took so long to get around to reading it. Might have saved a lot of agony for me and other people.."
192,Jeffrey Hanshaw,If all of us would only adhere to the wonderful advice put forth by Carnegie then we would all find our business and personal relationships flourish!
193,Chris Ruby,"After reading ""How to Win Friends & Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie, I realize that I do the exact OPPOSITE of what is proposed in the book (on a daily basis) and it has been to my detriment! As a result, I am making changes to the way I communicate with my family, friends and colleagues. I know this change will help me live a better life."
194,Chad,"A must read for anyone trying to do either of the two things the title suggests (""win friends"" or ""influence people""). All of the suggestions seem like no brainers, but then you realize that you're not doing them. There is a reason this book is still relevant after so many years."
195,Desiree Wills Velazco,Definitely one to read again!
196,Kendra,"This book has really great tips not only on how to get others to like you, but how to become a better person. I highly reccommend it."
197,Avn Raju,About to read the book
198,عارف المرشدي,أفضل كتاب في التنمية البشرية بلا منازع يكفيني أنه حصيلة 15 سنة من الأبحاث ومئات المراجع ، وليس كتاب نصائح وآراء من كاتبه ، رائع وإنصح به بشدة
199,Sandy,"all these principles are so practical. literally you can apply all of them to enrich your life, help yourself and others. Now I understand the power of church.. it is not because the bible, but great people always ready to serve others. also let your kids involve church activities to nurture their virtues and the spirit of leadership. I will read this book again, and teach my son about all these great principles. "
200,Klevi,"This book changed my worldview. It is not the greatest piece of literature I've ever encountered, as far the art of writing is concerned, but it is without a doubt a necessary and priceless component of the personal library of whoever is interested in the study of human relations."
201,Nicolas,Timeless principles to learn and diligently apply in real life 
202,Sudhir Mittal,"HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE, I believe deserves great respect from us. Only from this book I learnt - ""You cannot kick beehive if you love honey."" Here I trust, beehive means the world of friends and people who are important around us. We all are supposed to live our lives skillfully and not foolishly. We do not live on island. I am writing this because it's so surprising to see a few people criticizing this master work. A work that teaches you how to live skillfully, must not be 'kicked'. Maybe 'rebellious attracts most attention' is the motive behind certain people recording their negative remarks; though full democracy in our current times very much allows that.Above all, I had such a pleasant experience with this book. It's not that I was unaware of many things written by Dale, but effectually the words written in a book do make impact. Earlier to HOW TO WIN... I had read a few fantastic books, such as WHAT GOT YOU HERE WON'T GET YOU THERE. Tremendous experience it had been altogether. These kinds of books helped me refine as a person, both at home and at my workplace. I began to observe my behavior more meticulously now. I improved a lot. I made progress too. Later on another wonderful thing happened to me. I felt so inspired with new ways of life, that I ended up writing a book myself. It is LEAD LIKE A MASTER. I'd figured out generally what stops people from getting five star rating in their both kinds of life (home and workplace). And I poured it all into this book. I am glad to have contributed my bit. I have been receiving many reviews that LEAD LIKE A MASTER is indeed helpful for getting the readers Five-Star-Ratings. And it's all thanks to the legends like Dale, Marshal Goldsmith and many more who have continued to impress me till date. I wish happy reading to all, even generation to come with this timeless piece of work."
203,Bridget,Because common sense isn't.
204,Steffi Dipp,Brilliant book about how to manage your inter and intra personal relations.
205,Mohammed Kamal,"Nice book, I think our lives will much better when we apply these principles,though I think the writer is over-optimistic but let's try the advices and then judge :)But again it's a very nice book"
206,Marcus Calvin,"Wonderful book! Read it after you haven't read it for awhile and certain passages pop out at you in a new dimension. If your looking for a foundation of speaking to folks and being genuine in your approach, this is definitely a must ready"
207,Withoutink,"Older book, but lot's of good info, especially for an introvert like me. "
208,Imraan,"Carnegie wonderfully expounds on the trivialities of human interaction on every level, time, and place, making the etiquette of socializing simple and easy for anyone to understand and apply in their lives!"
209,Portia,"Great book for those of us who are socially inept! Seriously, I should have known 99% of the things I read but growing up as an only child and being raised by a single mom who also grew up as an only child... lets just say I was a tad socially awkward and lacked basic socializing skills. This book helped me learn some skills to not only interact with people, but to learn how to make myself likable which is something everyone is concerned with right? Towards the end it gets a little bland (for me at least) but overall it was fantastic! Highly recommend to anyone :)"
210,Kah Goh,Heard about this book from a colleague. I felt like I've learnt from this book and helped to improve my people skills. Certainly would recommend it to others.
211,Jazz Sembhi,AWESOME :)
212,Toivo,"This book is a classic on human nature. The title is misleading, as it is about how people think and what drives their decisions. A must read for everybody, and I have recommended this book to many former, and now very successful employees."
213,Rebecca,Tons of great advice in this book!
214,Ahmed,Amazing book for all times read
215,Owen Yoder,A must for anyone that wants to live a better life !
216,Mike Gray,"First time reading this one. I had always put off reading it thinking it was an old, out-of-date self-help book. I am glad I was wrong and mad I hadn't pushed myself to read it earlier in life. The principles are timeless, but it is the large selection of anecdotes from historical figures that made this really meaningful to me. You can get the principles from Wikipedia if you want the short version. You will miss so much this book offers though in the anecdotes involving Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, General Robert E. Lee, Socrates, Jesus and more. I anticipate reading this book many more times in the coming years because I fully believe that as life changes I will perceive different points to be more relevant or more wise than during the previous reading. I recommend this book for anyone that has a desire to learn and grow."

220,Shahabudin,"it is all by heart... either it's your sympathy, empathy, or even a slight gesture toward the person who look back at you."
221,Elliot Hellwig,"This is one helpful book.The writer is precise and understandable, giving a lot of practical information on how to make yourself a more likable person, and to get people to do what you want."
222,Chase Cottle,"Everyone in the world should read this book at least once a quarter, minimum. "
223,Sammy Ro,"An excellent instruction manual for dealing with people in all settings. The techniques discussed range from ""obvious, but good to remember"" to ""wow, I've been doing the opposite for years."" The book definitely gets repetitive, but I think that's the point given that there are a few major themes (e.g., empathy, positivity). Bottom line: I can see why this book has been popular for the past 100 years.For those who just want the techniques, here is a complete list:Fundamental techniques in handling people:1. Don't criticize, condemn or complain2. Give honest and sincere appreciation3. Arouse in the other person an eager wantSix ways to make people like you:1. Become genuinely interested in other people2. Smile3. Remember someone's name4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.5. Talk in terms of the other person's interests.6. Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.How to win people to your way of thinking:1. The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.2. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, ""You're wrong.""3. If you are re wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically4. Begin in a friendly way5.

Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest."
224,Craig,"I have wanted to read this book for well over 15 years now. It has been recommend by so many, who are much wiser than I am. I now regret that I did not read this sooner. Even though this book was written in a different generation, the principles in dealing with people remain true. Some of the examples in the book are humorous as they are very dated in regard to some sort of technology that might be referred to or a recent president that by the time I read the book has been out of office and even dead for many many decades. The writing is excellent, and made it very easy to digest. I believe this will be a book I add to my yearly reading list. The principles taught in this book are pretty simple, and in some cases rather basic, never the less they are often long forgotten techniques you can use to improve relationships. The main target of the book seem to be people in business, but I think with a little creative thinking these principles work in every situation that involve relationships. I work in the non-profit sector, and I see this information being very beneficial for me. I also look forward to applying it and using in working with my children. This really is a good read for nearly anyone! "
225,Roji Abraham,"This book is absolutely brilliant. It's surprising how a book that's over 70 years old can still be completely relevant in today's times. But then after all all the technology doesn't change the basic way in how humans behave, feel or think at an elemental level. Read this and start practicing what it says, it will definitely make you a much more sociable and likable person!"
226,Ron Hayes,Must read for anyone
227,Ressurrection,Great book! Helps you to pay more attention to how you give and receive in person to person interaction.
228,Stephen Boak,"I wasn’t expecting much when I opened Dale Carnegie’s canonical business school book How to Win Friends and Influence People. I anticipated a long series of platitudes about power and leadership, but it turned out to be one of the most insightful and enjoyable reads I’ve ever had.The book is a collection of warm and inspring stories gathered under Carnegie’s organizing principles. The principles are presented as rules to live by, and the stories like character-building exercises for each principle. It’s hard to imagine much of this being taught in today’s business schools, as most of the stories teach lessons in generosity, humility, and empathy."
229,Subrotho Bagchi,One awesome and mind boggling read. Great refresh your self overall and inside-out way. Anytime and every time read to up your self. 
230,Jonathan Perez,A solid reminder that communication and listening skills are at the center of everything. Thank you dad for recommending this book.
231,Lewis Hyam,Just read it - see the world differently!
232,Erick Nelson,one of the best books I have ever read - learn to improve your people skills and communication abilities.
233,Angelo,"The book shows signs of its age, making it hard to get through in the beginning. However, once you get over these initial hurdles, it's a wonderful compendium of the ""simple things"" that will lubricate your social and business life. Highly recommended!"
234,Mélissa Lampron,Livre audio. J'en suis à ma deuxième écoute et j'envisage de l'écouter une troisième fois. Excellent!
235,Stevie Dean,A classic self-help book...training for successful communication in all areas of life…it really needs to be reread at least once a year. 
236,Shelly,Great ideas on how to make new friends
237,Angela,"I am always reading this book. It will always be on my 'current reads,' and I suggest that it be added to yours."
238,Roger Agashe,"This book covers three topics in detail, how to converse, how to make people like you, and how to lead. For each topic there are approximately 10 principles that the author dedicates a chapter and shows many examples from Abraham Lincoln to a random family applying this rule to great success. Some principles are ""Give honest and sincere appreciation"" or ""Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.""I learned many new principles, and for the ones that seemed obvious like ""smile,"" Carnegie convinced me of their vast importance and I'm striving to do them better. It's a pleasure to read, and I would definitely read it over again(Carnegie actually recommends to do this several times). A good plan to truly absorb all of this information would be to apply a principle a day."
239,David Taylor,"It's not the book I expected. Title makes it sound like some cheesy ""Hey, it's great to meet you salesperson walks you through his bag if communication tricks. Instead, it's the seminal work on business communication. MANY books have been derived from the concepts taught here. Teaches you how to better connect with people. One if those books I need to re-read (or re-listen to) every year or so."
240,Holly,A book to be read over and over. It is a part of me. 
241,BBBTerri,I've read this book and portions of this book over and over for years and years. A good reminder for tact and good interpersonal communications...a lesson everyone can learn and utilize.
242,Devon,best book to help in life we all need to be better at relating to people if we want to better ourselves and get the best out of this life the lord gives us here on earth
243,Lawrence Ricson,Great tips to help you advance your professional career!
244,Rodney Hart,"There is a reason this book is a classic! It is essentially story after story of illuminating incidents, with insightful comments about how human nature gears people to feel at certain moments and how we can best deal with them. My favorite aspect of this book is that it doesn't over-simplify for the sake of having your traditional ""5-step"" business books. It highlights things like giving people compliments (which may seem obvious) but is insightful when it says that compliments only are meaningful if they are sincere and specifically applicable to the person you are talking too.Cons: some dated languagePros: when you read it lives up to its billing as a classic, full of human relationship insights relevant even after a century!"
245,Lynn,Great principles to get along with people.
246,Daniel Miesner,"A must read for any aspiring business person, or better yet, anyone who wishes to be an active, successful member of civilized society."
247,Samira,"هذا الكتاب هو مجموعة من الفصول اختيرت من أفضل كتابين لـ ديل كارنيجي. هما ""دع القلق و ابدأ الحياة"" و ""كيف تكسب الأصدقاء و تؤثر في الناس"". يعد الكتاب من أفضل ما قرأته من كتب تطوير الذات حيث يحتوي على العديد من الأمثلة و القصص لغرض التوضيح. يلخص الكتاب النقاط المهمة في الخاتمة بإيجاز و هي كما يلي:-	""قواعد من كتاب: دع القلق و ابدأ الحياة:1-	لا تقلد الآخرين و كن نفسك. 2-	طبق عادات العمل الأربع الجيدة: -	نظف مكتبك من جميع الاوراق, باستثناء تلك التي لها علاقة بالموضوع الذي تعالجة.-	افعل الأشياء طبقاً لأهميتها. -	حين تواجهك مشكلة, قم بحلها فوراً إذا توفرت لديك الحقائق الضرورية لاتخاذ قرار بشأنها.-	تعلم أن تنظم و تفوض و تدبّر. 3-	 تعلم أن تسترخي أثناء العمل. 4-	ضع الحماس في عملك. 5-	عدّد مزاياك, و ليس متاعبك. 6-	تذكر أن الانتقاد غير العادل هو مجاملة مبطنة. 7-	أبذل قصارى جهدك. - قواعد من كتاب: كيف تكسب الأصدقاء و تؤثر في الآخرين: 1- لا تنتقد أو تشجب أو تتذمر.2- امنح الثناء الصادق و المخلص. 3- أثر في الشخص الآخر رغبة جامحة. 4- اهتم بصدق الآخرين. 5- أجعل الشخص الآخر يشعر بأهميته, افعل ذلك بإخلاص. 6- أظهر الاحترام لآراء الشخص الآخر. لا تخبر الشخص الآخر أنه مخطئ.7- ابدأ بطريقة ودية. 8- استدرج الشخص الآخر لقول ""نعم"" في الحال قبل أن تظهر له موضع الخلاف بينكما في النقاش.9- اجعل الشخص الأخر يجعل الفكرة فكرته.10- ناشد الدوافع النبيلة. 11- أشر إلى أخطائك قبل انتقاد الشخص الآخر.12- تحدث عن أخطائك قبل انتقاد الشخص الآخر. 13- اسأل أسئلة بدلاً من إلقاء أوامر مباشرة.14- دع الرجل الآخر ينقذ ماء وجهه"". "
248,Cody Siemiatkowski,"While to book is old, Dale Carnegie's methods and advice are practical even now for a hard-working, high school student in the 21st century. Having always struggled socially, I found this book while searching online for advice on not coming across as a pessimist. After reading it, not only am I confident that the techniques and rules in this book will help me defeat my own pessimism, I plan on recommending it to anyone else who suffers from the same problem. "
249,Preet,"People say I remind them of this book, so I must have taken a lot from it."
250,Archie Meng,"without much doubt, one of the best books i have ever read. With the advancement in cyber technology, people can find information on most, if not all fields of studying and knowledge. What ultimately determines people's success is their people skills. However, that is the very thing the Internet cannot teach you. Open up this book, and you will find all the fascinations about human nature and human interactions."
251,Alexandros,One of the best books I've read on the subject. The irony is that I lost my best friend while reading it. Wish I had read it earlier...
252,Karrie,I have read this book more times than I care to admit. It is just a great guideline for being social and likable.
253,Arismendi Mejia,A must read classic
254,Karl,"1st book on sales I ever read, makes a lot of sense and is still very applicable."
255,Yogi Putra,Good Book with Good example not just Theory 
256,Eryn,Very interesting - lots of good tips and insights for dealing with people. I'm already trying make habits out of many of the principles.
257,Justin Mainville,Everyone in the world should read this book
258,Dave,This book was excellent. Lot's of common sense ideas to shift your perspective on how to deal with people.
259,Crixly Viera,Brilliant and inspiring. I literally couldn't stop reading it and wanted to take notes while reading because there were so many good points I didn't want to forget. Dale Carnegie describes events from his own life and his managing people and trying to get people to do what you want by making them think it's what they want to do. I just loved the whole approach of being nice and getting things done that way but I read this book while dealing with roommate issues so my frame of thought wasn't quite open to using the tactics right away.
260,Kwaku Yiadom,Most comprehensive insight into human relationships and a very thorough guide to becoming an effective leader.
261,Rian,This book is of great importance to me. I had difficulties in understanding How to interact with people. This book changed my life in a big big way. Must Read! 
262,Timon,"If you skip the anecdotes, the crap and the historical fallacies, there's a 30 page book of awesome in line."
263,John S,"Despite an awkward, creepy title, the best book ever written on getting along well with other people on a daily basis. Have used these techniques for 20+ years with success."
264,Ahmed Al-Mangour,"This book has changed me to become a better person. This book is a must read!The top principles that I've been focusing on after reading this book were:* Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.* Give honest and sincere appreciation.* Become genuinely interested in other people.* If you are wrong, admit it quickly andemphatically.* Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.* Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view* Dramatize your ideas.* Let the other person save face.* Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.* Let the other person do a great deal of the talking."
265,Robin Davis,"Excellent concept explanation of interpersonal relations and how to improve your ability to ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you"". Winning is about the result, not about hurting people. "
266,Fred,Awesome and life changing book. A lot of great tips how to make your life easier.
267,Goran,Possibly the best one book everyone should read in school.I believe this book can add value to anyone's life and improve social as well as business life.A must read if you want to understand practical form of communication.
268,Kadri,Best book ever that people should read at least once-a-year! Reminds you the basics that actually are THE basics that also make everything work/happen!
269,Sherri Moorer,"It amazes me how timeless the advice in this book is. If everyone in a leadership position even did a few of these things, I believe that people would be more productive and successful to a level that would be unimaginable. As it is, I have not seen these principals put into consistent practice in 21st century America. When people do it, the results are still amazing. The problem is, they're only followed out of desperation. It's a little discouraging to see that people are still falling into the same, age old traps of criticism and ""power plays"" to get things done. It could be done so much better if we played to strengths and not to humiliation or ""showing them who's boss."" I think this should be required reading for everybody in a leadership position of any kind, and would go so far as to say that they should be challenged to implement at least one part of this book into their lifestyle to see what a difference it could make. "
270,Megan Elizabeth,"If you only ever read one book in your whole life, I think it should be this one. And that's a hard thing for me to say, man. I've read a lot of REALLY good books..."
271,Jason Caldwell,One of my all time favorites. Worth reading multiple times.
272,Markku Tauriainen,"I finnished this awesome book of Dale Carnegie 1990´s when I was bit over 30 years old. One of the best wisdom book ever : ) for every man who is in business! Why?The central info in this book is the simplyfied way of thinking. To whom you really should point your interests out - how to think, to yourself and by from your own needs of making deals and sales? Absolutely NOW! Dale Carnegie´s wisdom is: Focus on your potential new customers life, way of thinking, what they really want hear and have.I will very highly recommend to read this book as a first ever book before starting to make steps in business. If you catch Dale´s wisdom, you will never fail. Your path will be golden, when you sell only benefits and advantages to your customers! And when you are showing a real genuine interests to them and their customers needs (b-to-b).

275,Karen Jain,Hello Nice job!!It is very informative and very helpful on my research online marketing. Thanks for sharing this good book.
276,Steven van Doorn,"Great book on how to improve your interpersonal skills. I found that it was a very easy read, the principles outlined straightforward and effective. The thing that makes the book so important is that the right way of handling situations or people is often the exact opposite of the best way. Taking the low road often gets you further than asserting your authority ever could. I recommend this book to everyone who wants to improve. "
277,Suvi,"I read this when I started my ""adult education"" of learning to grow as a person a long time ago. It was and is the best book I've read that applies to real life."
278,Ben Stevenson,Incredible book. Will read it every year. Everyone should read this book. Read it through twice now.
279,Honoree,"How to Win Friends and Influence People is a classic that should be read by everyone, at least once a year. I got mine in under the wire, but next year I'm going to read it once a month. There are so many common sense strategies and tips that don't seem to be as common as they could be ... even if you read it previously {like I did, about 20 years ago}, I guarantee you will re-enrich your life by giving it another read ASAP!"
280,Amy Sinnott,"The only book my dad ever read! He gave it to me when I was about 8 or 9, I read it cover to cover several times just because it was from him. I really believe it gave me a great head start in life, both personally and professionally."
281,Samer Chidiac,One of the Best books ever written on the subject!
282,Veselin Nikolov,Горещо препоръчвам. Общочовешки правила за човешките отношения. За много от не знаех и ми се иска да бях научил в детската градина.
283,Mackenzie,Definitely a self help classic. A good book to reread and review year after year. 
284,Bjartn,"A really great book for any person. The title sounds cynical, but the book is not at all."
285,Brandon Little,"Book that has many potentially life changing topics. Areas of interest are:techniques in handling people, making people like you, get people to your way of thinking and being an effective leader. As I have just read this book I dont have any major life-changing stories--yet. Although I can see it affecting the way I go about my daily life, interactions with people, and in some way my outlook on life already. "
286,Humphrey Boon,Truly brilliant! If you want to improve how you get thing done; this is the book for you!
287,Debbie,"Classic must read. Principles and techniques shared in the 1930's are still very real and effective today. I rarely give a book 5 stars, but had to in this case. It exceeded my expectations. I'm glad I read it, and have already successfu,ly used several of the techniques shared!"
288,John,This is a timeless book that simply teaches how to build relationships with people.
289,Lindsay Haber,Dale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People” is a non-fiction book that details human behavior; it also gives the reader instructions on how to accomplish their goals and truly get the most out of life.Carnegie makes a seemingly dull topic extremely captivating. His witty humor entertains the reader while his historical allusions and real life examples prove that his formula for success really works. Carnegie’s voice is honest and sincere. He manages to define human behavior from an objective viewpoint. He does not think he is special or lucky; he believes that success is attainable to anyone if they have the right tools. The text is broken up into chapters; each one is compromised of a different life lesson. This helps the pacing of the book and gives the reader places to start and stop. Carnegie’s repetition also plays a large role in the effectiveness of his concepts.This book has shown me that it is possible to make an advice book really interesting. It will improve my ability to capture an audience's attention even if the subject matter is not extremely entertaining and plot driven. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone. Every reader can gain helpful knowledge and utilize this publication. 
290,Scarlett,"This is the second time I have read this book yet I didn't think I remembered anything from the first time so when I reread it, I found a whole new treasure chest. This book changed my attitude about people and their behavior, their words. And I made a promise to myself to change."
291,Linda Horn,Very influential book for me as a teen.
292,Jessica Buike,"This is one of those rare gems of books that you can't just read once! You have to read it, then re-read it again to truly absorb all of the wonderful knowledge contained in these pages. I recommend it for any person looking to improve her- or him-self, not just business professionals or those who are feeling like they lack true friends. It is packed full of useful advice that is completely relevant today, despite the fact that this book was originally written so long ago. Keep this in your arsenal of personal development books!! "
293,Lady_lit,"Absolutely outstanding and a deserving classic of non fiction as relevant today, as in the era of its conception - and so it will be in another 50 years. Carnegie's narrative is engaging and warm, delivering information that many arguable subliminally, while presenting it in a way that even the most earnest practioner will be inspired to improve upon. I loved how it wasn't a lecture, but delivered kindly and interspersed with many anecdotes of others(Including some VERY famous people) and quotes. I honestly don't think that I've ever underlined a book so much before.I can't say enough about its benefits and am forcible ending this review here and now."
294,Vivian Chao,"This book serves as a great reminder that people are ""not creatures of logic, [they are] creatures of emotion"" and that we must remember to treat them as such. However, if you don't the time to read the entire book, I recommend the last section ""How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking"". It's got many great examples and tips such as: ""postpone action to give both sides some time to think through the problem"" and ""get the person saying yes, yes on the outset""."
295,Aaron Rumack,Read. Reread. Repeat. 'Nuff said?
296,Roswitha Muntiyarso,A superb book. Really useful in the real life situation
297,Gordon Casey,I love this book. I'm always reading it. 
298,Jonathan Bitgood,Simple ideas about basic communication yet it seems like these principles are not often practiced. A good read.
299,Dickson Xavier,Something that Influenced the Very Core of My existence and my character. 
300,Nitesh Kanthaliya,"I don't know how I came across this book, but the moment I picked this up, I was floored by the writing. The thought process of the author is amazing and the ideas presented are really fantastic and common sensical. We come across the described situation more than once per week and I am sure, that this is one of the book which will make a change in my way of life. Would be amongst those few books I will read more than once.I would recommend anyone and everyone to read this book. I agree that most of the teachings from the book are pragmatic in nature and can be followed in life. The most important take away from the book - Change your perception. See what you see from other's eye. Understand why someone did what they did. Appreciate Lavishly. "
301,Dellyna Septia,"Reading this book gave me so much moment to contemplate. Have many friends doesn't count if you couldn't make them feel comfortable when you're around.""We all know how to get the attention, but just few who know how to get attention and respect at the same time"""
302,Shaun Bicego,"The book may be 80 years old, but the principles are bang on. Simple, easy changes that will work wonders."
303,Bryan Bernhardt,One of my very favorites and one that I will continue to reference throughout my life. 
304,Devang,Amazing classic. If you want to improve yourself as a human being then this is exclusively paradise for you.I think this book will also arise interest in people who generally don't prefer to read this kind of books.
305,Brian Hart,"Gold standard. I have probably read this 4 times, need to read it again. "
306,Kostas,"brilliant book, with many take-aways for everyday life situations"
307,Steve Long,"one of the best business books I have ever read, because it goes beyond work, to how to live life to it's fullest."
308,Aligroof,"I've never been motivated by a motivational books. This book was the only exception. Usually I don't believe in this kind of books. I found it among my parents books and picked it out of bordem, I would never have bought it otherwise. Maybe the 5 stars tells more about what I was going through - I was going through depression and hated everybody - more than it tells about the book itself, you will never know unless you try it."
309,Gordon Paisley,One of the best books you will ever read. Everyone can benefit from this classic. Emminently readable. Recommended to everyone who can read. Just finished my fifth read of it and am re-impsired to live more carefully as I interact with people.
310,Douglas Green,"By far and away the simplest, most easy to understand book on how to change your life, your relationships, and everything around you. Universal truths that should be required reading in high school and college. Hint: This book isn't about you, it's about everyone around you. Treat people the way you would like to be treated."
311,Dujon,Excellent book to enhance your skill with people.
312,Laura,I will always love this book
313,Aiden Davis,"Goodreads Book Report on how to win friends and influence people	Dale Carnegie’s first book entitled “How to win Friends and Influence People” was the most eye opening book i've read in 10 years and the second most eye opening book i've ever read in my entire life. How to win friends and influence people doesn't only teach you how to influence people but it is in itself a very influencing book and it taught me a lot about what it means to be me as a teenaged male that's never been “Good” with people, it's taught me a lot. I wish I would've read it years ago.  “How to Win Friends and Influence People” is simply about how to win friends and influence people. Dale Carnegie is a genius when it comes to the human mind, not scientifically but Mentally, as in he doesn't understand the science behind the brain but understands how others can affect the brain with how they act and speak towards people. this book has four parts to it. Part One talks about the “Fundamental Techniques in Dealing with People”. Part Two talks about “How to Make People Like You”. Part Three Talks about “How to Win People to your way of Thinking”.and Part Four simply tells you to “Be a Leader”.Dale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People” is a must read for anyone that has trouble making or keeping friends."
314,Karen,One of the best books ever! Everyone should read this book. The title can be misleading. It's more about improving yourself and the way you interact with people and how you can do that more effectively. I marked this book up and plan to read it again and mark it some more.
315,Lukas Deem,"If you are an ambitions person, you will never reach your goals if you don't know how to manage people in your life. This book, though it may seem manipulative, provides excellent insight into getting the results you want in any exchange. The lessons are well designed and often communicated through engaging anecdotes."
316,Cyndi,"This was my favorite book in college, it just made so much sense with the leadership roles in my life."
317,Doug,Absolutely phenomenal . . . A masterpiece on interpersonal relations.
318,Elain,A very practical approach on how to influence people around you...
319,Dawn,"Always good info and the way to be, it isn't about you -- it's about others. :-)"
320,Christopher Vassel,"Changed my life. Looked at myself and everyone around me totally different in a good way. Quick read and would recommend it to everyone, not just those who have having a hard time in life."
321,Mohamed,Boost your communication skills
322,Ahmed Soliman,كتاب رائع لكاتب عملاق
323,Manish,Fantastic must read book. The Book will only help people who are looking to change themselves .There has to be a urge to bring a changes and progress that s when one can make full use of techniques presented in the books. I have been simply gaining and climbing in my life after i have read this book. I love it to the core and have made notes which i go through every day and since the techniques work it keeps me motivated.
324,Lorraine,Best book you will every read. Read it many times.
325,Abdullah Fouda,its great books
326,Saurabh,This is one of the best books anyone can read. It had a great impact on me. 
327,Yana Petrova,"This one is definitely a must-read for anyone working (and living) with people. The rules are very simple and yet powerful when it comes to empathy, understanding and good business or personal relationships. "
328,Drew B,One of the best books I have ever read.
329,Holly Kartchner,This book should be read on a yearly basis and we just might have world peace!
330,Dante Bergamotto,"Many people have recommended that I read this book. I am very glad that I listened to their advice. The basic idea behind the book is that is explains how people became successful through making relationships with other people. Warren Buffet, arguably one of the most successful people in the world promotes this book and says that this book helped him accomplished his achievements. The author of the book, Dale Carnegie, suggests that you read it often so that they ideas are in your head. I intend to do so because of the way that this book has already shown results. I am only a sophomore in high school and this book helped me to form relationships with people that I didn’t know so well at the beginning of the year. This was attained through using one of the earlier skills of “becoming genuinely interested in people” which seems like a no-brainer, but you would be surprised at how well that has worked just by leaving it in the back of my head. Another simple thing that I did was think from the other person’s perspective, and think about what they wanted. I have not been able to test out all of these tips, but after what one the tips has already done, I predict that the others will have just as great of an effect. It is amazing how much of an impact you can make on someone by just following the guidelines. Carnegie mentions in the book that there are classes that teach this book and other things involving Psychology. After reading this book, it spiked my interest in Psychology and the way that the human brain works. This book also goes into examples that are very interesting, and give a cool perspective of historical figures’ success that I never would have thought of had I not picked up this book. He gives you the perspective of President Lincoln for example and urges you to think of what they would do in that situation. Even if you somehow come across this book not aware of the information it holds, it will still be an enjoyable read. I don’t know how it wouldn't because it mentions on the back that it will go into how to make people like you, win people to your way of thinking, and to change people without arousing resentment.I would recommend this book to everyone because everyone could always improve their social skills. Since my reading of the book, this has been the most beneficial book that I have ever read, and I haven’t even tried out half of the things Carnegie put in there. I could see this information being helpful after high school, into college and for the rest of my life. Many people praise this book as being one of the best books that will lead you to success, and I 100% agree with them. "
331,Alyssa De Guzman,"It's a really good book.It doesn't teach you how to win friends and influence people by showing you the literal way of making friends.I believe it approached the topic on a different perspective. Moreover, i doesn't only change the way you make friends it also encourages you to change yourself for the better.it is somehow a self help book on improving one's personality and at the same time teaching you to win friends.It's a great book and I recommend everyone to read this. It's those kinds of book that can somehow restore humanit of everyone can only read this."
332,Coen,"You know, it's incredible that people don't know the things in this book. It's amazing. What is further amazing is how odd I feel even doing the simple things that it says! How far gone has society gone? One of the important things illustrated in the book is to use people's names when talking to them. It makes sense. It connects you to people. People love the sound of their names. But why is it so difficult? I go to the bank and I want to say, ""Thank you [name of teller:], have a good weekend!"" but I can't do it. I feel like I'm not supposed to use her name. I don't know her well enough, or she'll think I'm being too personal. How is that possible? I'm trying very much to get back into the game... be how I'd really rather be. It's just difficult because everyone is about personal space and texting. No one talks to each other anymore. It's sad."
333,Douglas Zwolski,"I can't believe how much I learned from this little book! ""I didn't know what I didn't know"" - Chris Brady. All time top 5 must read and implement books!"
334,Kumanan Murugesan,"Very good book. Very useful to anybody. After I reading that book, I learned a lot on how to improve my inter-personal skills. The main point that I learned from the book is not to criticize anybody and If you want to pinpoint mistakes, you have to highlight the good things first and then let them know the mistake is a easy one to correct. I have not been doing this before."
335,Marco Barajas,"This is a ""must read"" for everyone. Yes, the concept is very basic and we all ""should"" know it but really, we don't. You won't regret reading it. Some of the examples and stories are dated but what do you expect from a book written before the 1930's. Get past that and everything else is very relevant to today's business world. My children will not leave the house without reading this book."
336,Edmond Fernandes,"its good if people apply it, if i have reached till this level,its bcoz of influencing people, ideologies and etc"
337,Vica,This is a timeless classic for anyone interested in leadership - One of the best books I've ever read!

344,Mo_shuaibi,One of if not the best self help books. Very easy to read and relate to. Supported with good examples. I recommend it for anyone to read.
345,Heinz,I read this book in high school and there's a good reason it's a business and self-help classic. Dale Carnegie has influenced my dad's generation and mine.
346,Yingying,"This is the best book I love ever! It has a huge positive influence on me. I got the Chinese version in the year 2005, when I just completed my national examination for college. After reading this book, I decided to get involved in college activities even if I was very shy at that time. I felt great with a lot of friends in my undergraduate years, and I know most of them from various events. This book helped me so much, I appreciated it a lot."
347,Jenny Yelle,I can see why this book us an all time classic.
348,Trent,"It has been a while since I have read this book. Though I do remember it giving great tips on holding relationships and establishing them. Good book, will read again when I have time."

350,Matthew Glenn,This book taught me a lot of great concepts about managing people. There are a lot of things that I could use in my career and I hope to apply the concepts when I get more leadership responsibilities.
351,Noha Sherif,must be read from time to time . With a highlighter and try to grab some scrape phrases or let's say principals in a handy tool . wish my world be dealing together according to this directives

354,Sukan Sethi,"It's a manual for understanding human behavior.Read it once a year to reinforce the principles of human interaction.You will understand people more, and loved more."
355,Carolina,Um verdadeiro manual de como ser um ser humano e como lidar com as pessoas.
356,Sunil Kumar Dugulam,awesome classical principles that work even after the human race nears extinction....

358,Cameron Smith,One of my most favorite books!
359,Yasir Alruwaili,كتاب رائع ..قراءة واحدة لا تكفيه انصح الجميع بقراءته

367,Gavin,"Everyone should read this book. It's purpose is to change the way you see people and conduct yourself in a proper business fashion. Thus, creating a successful transaction, if you will, where ever you go. I read it while working in sales because my manager suggested it. And once I started seeing all my errors and how to improve myself with random people, my sales skyrocketed. Everyone really should really read this book. "
368,Candace Smith,"This is another of my continuous reader books. This is my first time through, but I've decided that it's going to be reviewed often until the principles it teaches are habits in my character. This has got to be one of the best leadership book ever written. I highly recommend to anyone seeking to improve their relationships in any part of their life."
369,Shannez Vancauwenbergh,"Very amazing personal development book! Dale Carnegie teaches you how to interview, how to listen to people and how to connect with them. A must read."
370,Ahmad Moshrif,كتاب بسيط في محتواه عميق في تأثيره، من الكتب التي يجب على الإنسان أن يقرأها في حياته.جميل جداً

374,Danish Adenwala,"i think it is a small book packed with loads of wisdom.the book certainly guides you in dealing effectively with people and achieving your objectives, but with a good intention.the teaching of this book is good and it certainly has been a result of life long study and experience.must read this book."
375,Eryc,A classic that took me forever to finally get to. Glad I did. I love the fact that so much that Carnegie intuited was later validated by research. Timeless stuff. 
376,Gabriel Castellanos,Best relaionship book a must read classic. 
377,Amberjoynelson,"This is one I will have to reread many times more. Although the information is very common sensical, it is easy to forget to put it into practice daily. A very pleasant and quick read!"
378,Carlos Rodarte,"I can't believe it took me this long to pick up this book. The book is laid out in a very easy to read manner, and can easily be digested. I am adhering to the recommendation at the onset of the book, and revisit it time and again for a refresher. "
379,Renato Diniz,"This book is just amazing! A MUST for every human being.It is outstanding how much we do not know about how to deal with people!""How to win friends and influence people"" is a complete guide to human interaction. It taught me how to understand others and extract the best of each person.It is not just how to make friends, it is about how to be a better human, what then leads to make friends and influence people."
380,Keith Lawrence,An excellent foundation in human relations and communications. I've lost count of the times I've read it (I try to read it every year) but still I learn from it... It couldn't recommend it more highly!
381,Zach Merk,"How to Win Friends & Influence People by Dale Carnagie is one the original books on leadership. I am glad I chose to read this book, which was recommended to me by a friend. I borrowed his copy, and after I finished reading the book, I ended up buying my own copy to have. This book teaches you fundamental techniques in handling people, six ways to make people like you, how to win people to your way of thinking, and how to be a leader. A lot of the ideas in this book are common sense, but this book gives you good ways of implementing these skills in your everyday. It has many great stories in it to help you remember what these skills are too! This is a very easy read, and I had difficulty putting it down at times. Dale Carnagie's book has already impacted my life and my relationships; I cant believe its not a required read for everyone in high school. Read this book!!"
382,Umesh Halappa,"Read on recommendation by an office colleague. This book has been quite useful.Definitely recommend this book to someone like me, who is socially less able."
383,Yolanda,"Some books that have profoundly affected my life, and how I deal with family, acquaintances and friends include:How to Really Love Your ChildBetween Parent and ChildThe Proper Care and Feeding of HusbandsThe Road Less TraveledThe ScripturesAND.... Ta Da!!! How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. This was the first ever book written about human relations and it is still the best. I read it Many Years Ago and had almost forgotten about it until I happened upon it at the library a few days ago. I have re-read it and it was definitely worth the time.Now I know where I learned a lot of what I know. Thank you, Mr. Carnegie."
384,Khaled AlFaleh,من الكتب القيمة يساعد الانسان على اجادة فن التعامل مع الناس ويبين الايجابيات والسلبيات في التعامل ويساعد على اكتساب الناس من خلال التعامل وهذ مايختاجة كل انسان في الحياة انصح بقراءة الكتاب 
385,Philip,Amazing book with an excellent message. I am implementing some of these in my day to day interaction with others.
386,Chiara Cokieng,"It's the cheesiest title ever. But seriously, everyone should read this book. Getting into each advice, my head goes, ""But I can't do that because..."" and then the chapter goes on to tell stories and reasons that show how wrong my (and popular!) thinking is. This book taught, convinced, and changed me into not being a smart ass who has to be right all the time. Seriously, what are you waiting for? Read this book."
387,Krishna,"A must read book. It will guide you in realizing how what you say can affect others. Pleasant read, definitely checkout the audio book."
388,Erin Taylor,This book really helped me especially when disciplining and teaching my child and how to get her to want to do what I want her to do. It also helped me in the work place on how to influence others to my way of thinking.

390,Blakefam,A must read for young adults
391,Nephi,Great information on how to treat others for your own benefit.
392,Kenny Lee,A definite book on handling people. highly recommended to anyone anytime whether they're looking to improve their relationship with people or already a good communicator. you can definitely benefit from this. 
393,عقيل,كتاب رائع لديل كارنيجي انصح اي شخص بقراءته وخاصة في بداية الشباب فسيغير نظرتك للأمور وطريقة تعاملك مع الناس. تمنيت لو تسنى لي قراءته قبل سنوات من الان
394,Zameel,Dale's 10 years of research has contributed a lot to us....there has never been a similar book ever published....
395,Michael Steinsdoerfer,"This is a fantastic book for a person who finds themselves in a leadership position but feels ill-equipped and undertrained in it. The book is broken up into small segments so you can read it at your own pace and put the suggestions into practice immediately. You will want to keep this book close after completing as a resource of basic ""how-to's"" in everyday leadership situations. "
396,Tim Dierckxsens,"Simply timeless. We all know these rules yet fail to apply them. This book is filled with stories to give you context of how different responses give different outcomes. Keeping these stories in mind will help you become aware of how you are responding to situations or events around you. You will learn to pause, reflect and create a better solution."
397,Art,"Absolutely smashing read on human relations. I cannot think of a single person who wouldn't benefit from this timeless classic. A lot of the time-tested advice offered in the book is not ""new"" per-say, but it is rather compelling and the bevy of real life examples make it easy to apply the principles. Strongly recommend it! "
398,Prateek,One of the best self-help books you can ever read. Consists of timeless wisdom & tips that will stay with you forever and make you a better person.
399,Michele,This book helped me tremendously both in my professional and personal lives.
400,Cherry Coley,"First let me say that this book and the wisdom and insight it provides will never outlive it's usefulness. The book its self is a good reminder of respecting your fellow man, and that just because you're right or disagree, doesn't mean you should stand and demand recognition and belittle someone just because you can. The art of influence needs to be re-cultivated in our current society where people believe it's okay to beat someone down with their own opinion just because it is different than their own. Beating someone down and forcing them to agree is not influencing them, it is bullying them. This is not a good way to live, not a good way to do things and whether in business or in personal life, the toll on the relationship will eventually become evident. Dale Carnegie was a master at getting people to step back, be humble and patient enough to listen, to find out what the other persons needs or concerns were, learning how to address them and put the other person at ease and THEN moving forward. It is a lesson that needs to be carried forward and reinforced. I have this book in book form and on Audible. I listen to it once in awhile as a refresher and reminder. If you have not read or listened to this book, it is well worth the effort. This is not time that will be wasted. "
401,Lloyd Bilal,very good book if you are having problems getting along with people
402,Lyg,A guide for life. A reread at intervals until I have ingrained these ideas is in order.
403,Luu Khue,"Read this long time ago in Vnese version. I was really interested in the book and it gave me quite good thoughts for my life. I thought it was written by some vnese guy at the time. Then when got back to the interest of reading self-helped books few months ago. Found this version in english and read it till the end. Though I have read this book before, but it's still give strong impact as a reminder for what I choose to live.Great book from my view!"
404,Nickole,Great info. I think I will read it every 5 years. Everyone should! 
405,Steven,"I read this once a year. This book has taught me how to work with people, who make every decision that affects you. This should be taught in school as its lessons have led to much success in life, business and relationships."
406,Shashi bhushan,not a single book can be written on personality development wdout this one the tragic of this book is that it is written by one of d greatest failures of his life . who had never succeeded in his life .
407,Prince,THIS IS A GREAT BOOK FOR ME.....
408,Warren,This book was a great read for someone as introverted as I am. It gave me a better understanding of social interactions and motives. Would recommend to anyone struggling to understand the way people think.
409,Erica Oglevie,I was pleasantly surprised by this book. Originally I judged these principles to be manipulative. But as I listened to the book I came to realize that many of the shortcomings in business and friend relationships are due to the exploitation of others toward self interest. I didn't find these principles to be manipulative at all. In fact I found this to be a great tool box. This book helps me have the tools to express consideration and compassion towards others; this is a skill I seriously lack although I feel it inside I'm unable to express it adequately.
410,Cullen McGowan,This book can make you a better person if taken seriously.
411,Garrett,"The title of this book is decieving: How to Win Friends and Influence People. Generally, we don't win friends. We earn them over time through our actions. Conversely, we all need to be able to influence people in positive ways. Each section introduces a principle, for example: ""The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it."" Then, it expounds upon the principle with recountings of situations in which the principle applies. The book provides examples of people who taught these very principles. In one section, Carnegie sites Jesus when he said, ""Agree quickly with your adversary."" This book is about successfully managing our human relationships. It collects a lot of ideas and teaches them all at once. It is a book that contains a lot of common sense; yet, we all struggle with our personal and professional relationships.If you dedicate your yourself to practicing one principle a week, you will be a better person every week of the year. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
412,Anugrah Nagaich,"Simply the best book out in the market for improving your interpersonal skills. First published in the 1930's, this book is continuing being recommended & preferred even after 70+ years thus reflecting its excellence. The best part is that unlike other management or self-grooming/improvement books, the author's language here is so much casual, ascertaining with examples where-ever possible,that it gradually becomes a fun to read & making it easier to comprehend the real essence.Surely a must read at least once. I would *strongly* recommend it."
413,Nippon,"E'l'unica guida che insegna a saper parlare instaurando ottime relazioni interpersonali. La retorica è un'arte affascinante. E' il primo libro che leggo dove ci sono le ""istruzioni per l'uso"". Non saprei dire se il suo metodo funzioni: certo sarà servito a molti, però è molto sottile, difficile, richiede astuzia, ritmo (saper aspettare i tempi) ed esercizio. Ho preso tantissimi appunti. Dai consigli che elargisce, l'uomo sembra essere un essere spregevole, concentrato solo su di sé. (principio 3: ricordatevi che per una persona il suo nome è il suono più dolce e più importante in qualsiasi lingua) Ma si può essere così egocentrici? Si, si può. Anch'io la penso come Dale.Molte sue lezioni già le conoscevo, come i primi capitoli del libro, però leggendolo ho potuto approfondire con nuovi concetti e soprattutto conoscere meglio personaggi come Lincoln, Al Capone, Rockfeller, Crowley ""2 guns"", T. Roosevelt. Questo libro è come un manuale per risolvere i problemi di tutti i giorni. Permette di trasformare qualunque lettore e di prestare più attenzione al proprio comportamento. E' interessante coinvolgente : basta relazionare gli errori commessi alle pagine lette."
414,Shanna,"This book is amazing! Don't be fooled that it was originally written in the 1930s, the principles in it are still true today...we humans don't change THAT much. LOVED IT!"
415,Vinay Hy,Already lots & lots of reviews followed by praise have been showering to Dale Carnegie and I am very proud to say that I am among those many. Its in the best interest of everyone that I reveal nearly nothing about this book because it is highly recommended by me that you go thro' this personal experience of reading this book all by yourself :) !So buy this NOW & Change your life ..★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ '[Carnegie] changed my life' - Warren Buffett.★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Need I say anything ;) ?
416,Youngju,Timeless advice. teaches you how to deal with other people. 
417,Lee,Everyone should read it twice.
418,Debica,"This book is on the top of my list. A life changing book that everyone should read. 'I'm not teaching a bag of tricks. End of the day, none of this would work if there are no sincerity and empathy' The honesty put down by Dale Carnegie got me hooked in this book till the finishing. I strongly recommend this book for everyone."
419,Kristal,"I am wanting to work from home selling handmade crafts, but I still felt like I need to learn my business and for that reason, I have tried to find a few books that might help me. And I feel like this one not only helped me learn some good business etiquette but also how to (hopefully) be a better person. There are no earth-shattering secrets listed yet the techniques are simple things that many people overlook in their daily lives and could benefit from applying them and opening up many more doors. This is definitely one of those books that would benefit from multiple readings as there are many areas that are touched on and can be applied as needed. "
420,Zocurtis,"A must read for anyone. This book is packed with simple, day-to-day principles that serve to help people get along, simply put. It is probably one of the first books anyone should read."
421,Max Bush,"This book is a manuel to effectively win people over. Definitely something I'll reread through my lifetime. Biggest highlight for me was learning techniques on how to remember names. I was terrible and decided to change it, thanks to that chapter. "
422,Gunar Gessner,"Recommended to everyone. I wanted to read this book over again and again. Dale Carnegie shows you how simple it can be to have empathy, but how powerful it is as a way of better communicating with people and achieving positive outcomes for both sides. This should be a must-read at schools."
423,John Schneider,"""I've not written a book of tricks but a new way of life."" Dale CarnegieOne might think from the title of this book that Dale Carnegie has written a ""how to"" book on manipulation. Nothing could be further from the truth. To quote an Eastern proverb, ""If you wish to change the world, you must first change yourself."" In ""How to Win Friends and Influence People,"" Carnegie presents techniques on how to act like a decent individual. He contends that if you act like a decent person to other people, then you will in turn be treated much better by other people. Reading this book will reveal how often we all fail at acting decently and gently. If you want to live a better life, then read this book and put its lessons into practice. Although I can't claim to practice this book perfectly, what I have put into practice certainly have helped me."
424,Joe Roche,This book is must-read for anyone in business. 
425,Chris,More important to humankind than the bible!
426,Courtney Stout,"Fantastic read. I loved this! Such great tips for interacting with your friends, co-workers, and strangers! "
427,Bob Schenck,"One of my Dad's books. I read it many, many years ago."
428,Keith,I have read this book 3 times this year and I learn something new each time!!!
429,Kirsten,"A classic! Worth rereading, especially when facing a change in life - new job, new school, new neighborhood, new church, new friends."
430,Patrik Hallberg,"You might Think it's common sense, you might Think it's an easy read, you might even Think it's easy to live by...For me it's the second time I read it. I read it once when working at Intentia, but it was this time it made an impact it was this time I realized that I must read this book every year and try to live by it for the rest of my Life...it might be easy to read in a couple of hours but to live by it that's the challenge! I really, really loved this book."
431,David Thompson,Very practical and best I've read in this areaDale Carnegie has written a fantastic Tomb of knowledge here. For anyone looking to improve there soft skills I highly recommend it. The examples were fantastic and really hit home to moments in my life which made it a highly impact full book for me. Great book a must have.
432,Sevo,"Great book, I already know I will read it again and again."
433,Marc J. Dubois,"One Life changing book. Must read if you are into personal development & growth. You can apply what you learn in this book in your social life, work life, love life and so on. Dale Carnegie is easy to read and gives great lessons about human beings and relationships dynamics. He illustrates his ideas with numerous examples from great leaders, thinkers and also persons like you and I. The author has this ability to get close to his reader and accompanying him in his quest to self-realization."
434,Chrisanne,"At first glance this may look like a how-to be manipulative manual but it's not. It's a how to be that person you always wanted to be. The person who enjoys socializing, who isn't afraid of people and who is at home in any situation. Genuine people do these things-- sometimes unknowingly. Sure, some people may abuse them, but if you're really doing it the right way then the focus becomes all about the other person. Love It! "
435,Amy Ambarani,to all people who still needs others to live... READS THIS BOOKS !!!
436,Chittu Desai Reddy,Literally saying this is one of the book that changed my life....
437,Ahmed Essam,افضل كتاب قراءته فى حياتي لقد غير حياتي فعلا
438,Madison,"This was an excellent read. Very informative and entertaining, I recommend it to everyone who wants to know more about handling people."
439,Songguy,"I wish this book was named something else - like ""How to treat people respectfully"" or something else that doesn't make you feel like you need friends or actually want to influence people. It's just a really good handbook about how to be a nice person."
440,Rich Perrotti,"I have read this book at least once every year since the late 80's. It's been in print for 77 years and the info is just as (if not more) valuable as the day it was written. The better we get in working well with one another, the better the world will be. "
441,Faye Oney,"This book was originally written in the 1930s, but it is still relevant today. The author explains how to use psychology and good manners to get people to do what you want. The principles in this book can apply to your personal as well as professional life. The underlying message is essentially the Golden Rule: Treat others as you would want to be treated. I highly recommend this book, and I'm sorry I haven't read it before now. An excellent read for salespeople."
442,Jessica Cox,"Amazing. Wish I'd read this book in high school!Instrumental in learning to communicate well with other human beings :).Great stories and illustrations throughout, and a humble perspective of how to understand other people.Will have to re-read to absorb thoroughly. In the meantime, I apologize for my learning curve. :)"
443,Paige Gordon,"This book is amazing! Mr Carnegie lays out clearly and concisely some steps you can take to become a more likable, friendly person and a more effective leader of those around you. I will admit that I was a little hesitant to read it at first, foolishly think ""I don't need to be taught how to make friends!"" but I had no idea what I was missing! This book is wonderful and will be re-read many, many times from now on. If you haven't read it yet, go buy it and read it today. If you have read it, go pick it up again and re-read it today. You won't be disappointed! "
444,Ximena,Amazing and helpful!
445,Ezra Crangle,One of my favorite's ever!
446,Vivian Adram,Loved this and am going to make it a point to reread at least 4x a year!
447,Jacque,A classic -- the foundation for many of the success books written today. Groundbreaking for it's time. I first read it decades ago. Worth re-reading.
448,Troy Kuhn,This book is one of the best I have ever read. A true classis and a must for anyone that deals with people or wants to improve their people relationship skills.
449,Linda Newman,"Should be required reading and used as a learning text for everyone, starting in childhood. Not everyone learns the ""rules"" of getting along in life."

459,Zbyszek Sokolowski,"Zdecydowanie warta przeczytania, mądra, pokazująca jak mądrze radzić sobie z ludźmi. Gdyby ludzie znali i stosowali mądrość w niej zawartą Świat byłby lepszy.Cytaty:Otóż nawet w zawodzie inżyniera, tak wydawałoby się, specjalistycznym, sukces finansowy zaledwie w 15% wynika bezpośrednio z umiejętności fachowych; pozostałe 85% zależy od „inżynierii dusz” – osobowości i zdolności przywódczych.„W porównaniu z tym, czym powinniśmy być – powiedział kiedyś słynny profesor William James z Harvardu – w stosunku do naszych możliwości jesteśmy jedynie na poły rozbudzeni. Czynimy użytek jedynie z niewielkiej części naszych psychicznych i fizycznych potencjałów. Mówiąc inaczej, człowiek żyje w ciasnych, wyznaczonych przez siebie samego granicach. A przecież posiada najróżniejsze możliwości, których nie wykorzystuje na skutek złych nawyków.” Możliwości, których „nie wykorzystujemy na skutek złych nawyków”. Jedynym celem tej książki jest pomóc czytelnikowi w odkryciu, rozwinięciu i wykorzystaniu z zyskiem tych drzemiących w nas, ukrytych sił.Krytykowanie jest bez sensu, ponieważ zmusza do obrony i zwykle powoduje, że zaczynamy się usprawiedliwiać. Jest niebezpieczne, gdyż rani naszą dumę, poczucie wartości i budzi niechęć.Jest tylko jeden sposób pod słońcem, aby sprawić, by ktoś coś zrobił. Czy kiedykolwiek zadałeś sobie trud, żeby się nad tym zastanowić? Tak, tylko jeden sposób. Trzeba sprawić, aby ten ktoś chciał to zrobić. Pamiętaj: nie ma żadnego innego sposobu.W kontaktach z ludźmi musimy pamiętać, że nie są to istoty kierujące się logiką. Mamy do czynienia z istotami powodowanymi emocjami, pełnymi uprzedzeń i dumy wynikającej z próżności.Krytykować, potępiać i narzekać potrafi każdy głupiec – i większość głupców to robi. Ale aby zrozumieć i darować, potrzeba charakteru i samokontroli. „Wielki człowiek pokazuje swoją wielkość przez sposób, w jaki traktuje maluczkich” – powiedział Carlyle.„Uważam, że najcenniejszą rzeczą, jaką posiadam, jest umiejętność rozbudzania w ludziach entuzjazmu – powiedział Schwab – a jedyny sposób, w jaki można nakłonić człowieka do ujawnienia tego, co w nim najlepsze, to uznanie i zachęta. Nic tak nie niszczy ambicji w ludziach jak krytyka zwierzchników. Nigdy nie krytykuję nikogo. Wierzę w dawanie ludziom bodźców do pracy.Kilka lat temu przeprowadzono wywiady z żonami, które opuściły mężów. Jak sądzisz, co było główną przyczyną ich odejścia? Brak uznania. I założyłbym się, że podobne badania wśród mężczyzn, którzy odeszli od żon, przyniosłyby te same wyniki. Często jesteśmy tak pewni lojalności swoich współmałżonków, że nie przychodzi nam do głowy powiedzieć im, jak bardzo ich cenimy.To bardzo dobra rada i chcę ją powtórzyć: jeśli jest w ogóle jakiś sekret sukcesu, leży on w umiejętności przyjęcia punktu widzenia innych i patrzeniu na rzeczy zarówno z pozycji rozmówcy, jak i własnej.Tysiące zmęczonych, źle zarabiających i zniechęconych akwizytorów zdziera dziś zelówki na ulicach naszych miast. Dlaczego? Ponieważ zawsze myślą tylko o tym, do czego sami dążą. Nie zdają sobie sprawy z faktu, że ani ty, ani ja nie chcemy niczego kupować.Gdybyśmy chcieli, po prostu poszlibyśmy do sklepu. Jednak i ty, i ja jesteśmy zawsze zainteresowani rozwiązaniem naszych problemów. I jeśli akwizytorzy wykażą, że ich towary lub usługi pomogą nam je rozwiązać, nie będą musieli nas namawiać do kupna. Sami kupimy. A klienci lubią czuć, że sami kupują jakiś towar, a nie że towar jest im sprzedawany.Nawet chorobliwi pieniacze często miękną i dają się uspokoić, gdy mają przed sobą cierpliwego i współczującego słuchacza, który nie protestuje, kiedy władczym głosem wyrażają oburzenie i wypluwają z siebie jad.„Są tak przejęci tym, co mają za chwilę powiedzieć sami, że nie trzymają uszu «otwartych»… Wiele ważnych osobistości mówiło mi, że wolą dobrych słuchaczy od dobrych mówców, ale umiejętność słuchanie wydaje się rzadsza od wszystkich innych.”Małe zdanka, takie jak „przepraszam, że sprawiam kłopot”, „czy zechciałby pan…”, „czy mogę prosić…”, „czy miałby pan coś przeciw.” i wreszcie „dziękuję”, a więc te drobne uprzejmości naoliwiają tryby monotonnej maszyny codziennego życia. I przy okazji stanowią znak rozpoznawczy dobrze wychowanych.W dziewięciu przypadkach na dziesięć spór kończy się tym, że każda ze stron przekonana jest bardziej niż kiedykolwiek o własnej racji.Kłótnia jest zawsze twoją przegraną. Dlaczego? Ponieważ jeśli przegrasz, to przegrałeś, a jeśli wygrasz, to i tak przegrałeś. Przypuśćmy, że zatriumfujesz nad innym człowiekiem, obracając w gruzy wszystkie jego argumenty. Udowodnisz mu, że jest non compos mentis. I co wtedy? Ту poczujesz się świetnie. A twój rozmówca? Pokażesz mu jego niższość, zranisz jego dumę i spowodujesz, że obrazi się za twoje zwycięstwoPohamuj swój temperament. Pamiętaj, że klasę człowieka można mierzyć tym, co wyprowadza go z równowagi. Najpierw słuchaj. Daj oponentowi szansę wygadania się. Pozwól mu skończyć. Nie przerywaj i nie protestuj. To tylko wznosi bariery. Próbuj budować mosty porozumienia. Nie stawiaj kolejnych przeszkód na drodze do niego.Obiecaj oponentowi, że przemyślisz jego pogląd i dokładnie go przeanalizujesz. I faktycznie to zrób. Twój rozmówca może przecież mieć rację. Jest o wiele łatwiej zgodzić się na ponowne przemyślenie argumentów rozmówcy niż gwałtownie przeć do przodu i doprowadzić do sytuacji, w której będziesz musiał usłyszeć: „Próbowałem przecież ci to powiedzieć, ale nie słuchałeś.”Czasem zmieniamy zdanie sami z siebie bez żadnego nacisku. Jednak jeśli ktoś mówi nam, że nie mamy racji, powoduje, że nasze serca stają się twarde. Jesteśmy nieprawdopodobnie wręcz niedbali w kształtowaniu naszych przekonań, ale w momencie, kiedy ktokolwiek chce nam je zabrać, natychmiast wypełnia nas niezłomna wiara w ich słuszność. Oczywiście, to nie przekonania są nam tak drogie, lecz nasza duma własna, która jest przez to zagrożona… Mały zaimek „mój” jest słowem najważniejszym dla każdego człowieka i właściwe zrozumienie tego faktu stanowi klucz do mądrości. Ma tę samą siłę bez względu na to, czy jest to „mój” obiad, „mój” pies, „mój” dom, „mój” ojciec, „mój” kraj czy „mój” Bóg. Odrzucamy z urazą nie tylko zarzuty, że nasz zegarek źle chodzi albo nasz samochód jest kiepski, ale również możliwość, że nasze wyobrażenia o kanałach na Marsie, sposobie wymowy słowa Epiktet, wartości medycznej salicyny czy panowaniu Sargona Pierwszego mogą zostać podważone. Lubimy wierzyć we wszystko to, co przyjęliśmy raz za prawdę, i podważenie któregokolwiek z naszych przekonań powoduje, że za wszelką cenę szukać będziemy wytłumaczenia, dlaczego je żywimy. Waśnie dlatego nasze tak zwane rozumowanie sprowadza się do wynajdowania argumentów, które pozwolą nam wierzyć dalej w to, w co już wierzymy.Jeśli się mylimy, możemy to przyznać sami przed sobą. A jeśli postępują z nami delikatnie i taktownie, przyznamy się do tego przed innymi, a nawet będziemy dumni z naszej szczerości i otwartości. Ale nie wtedy, gdy ktoś próbuje wepchnąć nam nasze niestrawne słowa z powrotem do gardła.Jestem przekonana, że nie osiągnie się nic dobrego, a można tylko wyrządzić wiele szkód mówiąc komuś wprost, że nie ma racji. Jedyna satysfakcja to odarcie rozmówcy z poczucia godności; z siebie czynimy wówczas nie chcianego rozmówcę.”Odwaga przyznania się do własnych błędów przynosi wiele satysfakcji. Nie tylko pozbawia poczucia winy, ale często pozwala rozwiązać problem spowodowany tymi błędami.Każdy głupiec potrafi podjąć próbę obrony swoich własnych błędów – i większość głupców to robi. Ale przyznanie się do nich daje poczucie wyższości i szlachetności, poczucie, że jest się lepszym.Krytyka podcina nam skrzydła. Nasze możliwości rozkwitają na skutek zachęty. O tym nie wolno zapomnieć dobremu przywódcy. ZASADA SZÓSTA Pochwal najmniejsze nawet osiągnięcie.Krótko mówiąc, jeśli chcesz wpłynąć na coś w postępowaniu danej osoby, zachowuj się tak, jakby już posiadał pożądaną cechę.Wystaw im dobrą opinię, na którą mogliby zapracować, a uczynią olbrzymi wysiłek, aby cię nie zawieść."

461,Shawn,A classic that is well worth reading.
462,Paul Simkins jr,Actually recently re-read this book. Tremendous insights that you will hear in different forms from different people today. Pay attention and apply what you read and see what a difference it will make in your life.
463,Gillianne,A must read and re-read for anyone who lives/ works/ plays with people.
464,Mingyi,Worth reading over and over again. New learning every time. 
465,Dorsaf,"This book is worth reading.Here some quotations from it:"" Don't complain about the snow on your neighbor's roof, when your own doorstep is unclean""""A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men""""Don't be afraid of enemies who attack you.Be afraid of the friends who flatter you""""Every man I meet is my superior in some way.In that, I learn of him.""""People who can put themselves in the place of other people, who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them"""" One wears on one's face is far more important than the clothes one wears on one's back""""Actions speak louder than words"""
466,Elena,"As much as we thirst for approval,we dread condemnation."
467,Doug Perry,Dale Carnegie's best. No one does a better job of teaching you how to put others' interest and needs before your own.
468,Herson Alexandrino,Best book I ever read!
469,Rob Wilder,"If you are in the capacity of managing people or you would like to drastically improve the way you communicate and work with people, then this is your bible! It is one of those books that qualify to be on the short list of ""life changing"""
470,Brandon Baggett,"Great little bits of information for you scattered through out this book. Not just on ""how to win friends"" but on history and how people think as a whole. "
471,Aziza Khan,"A lot of people have talked about it, thought u might just read it my self, I think it's better what they all said about it. It's more about self improvements "
472,Daryl King,Read this book back in mid 1980's and loved it. Would rank it as one of the top 10 books a person should have in their library. 
473,Rahul Sinha,"This one might seem like a no brainer, due to its status as a classic. Aptly named, this book discusses how to “express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people.”"
474,Rhyando,Carnegie teach us not to win friends but to be a good sincere person and friends will be win without we realize it.
475,Marcello Scacchetti,Old but still actual principle on how to handle relation with people.
476,Adam Van,"When I first heard the title of Carnegie's description of successful human relations, I must admit that it sounded almost as if it had a malevolent tone to it. That notion soon left me when I read the summaries of the chapters and eventually the whole book. I grew up with some understanding of most of the ideas that are promulgated by Carnegie, but had never organized them into quite the cohesive unit of philosophy and behavior that his book details. I highly recommend this book to anyone who deals with people and would like to improve their positive interactions with those around them."
477,Jun Nguyễn,"Chắc vai trò của cuốn ""Đắc nhân tâm"" với thể loại sách kĩ năng cũng gần giống khai quốc công thần nhỉ.Biết rõ sách kĩ năng bây giờ rất đa dạng, không còn giới hạn gọn trong giao tiếp (vốn từ trước đến giờ vẫn là mảng lớn nhất trong sách kĩ năng) mà đã mở rộng sang nhiều thể loại hơn từ quản lí chi tiêu, thời gian đến dạy con cái. Nhưng khi đọc một cuốn sách kĩ năng nào đó, có thể bạn sẽ thấy thấp thoáng bóng hình của ""Đắc nhân tâm"".Một cuốn sách tuyệt vời, viết bởi một tác giả tuyệt vời, được dịch bởi dịch giả (Nguyễn Hiến Lê) tuyệt vời "
478,Marianne,everyone in sales should read this book - oldie but goodie
479,Heather Iveson,"Although this is a book I couldn't avoid knowing about, I did avoid reading it for many years as I have a deep-seated cynicism regarding self-help books. In this case, that cynicism was misplaced.The book offers straightforward, practical advice and examples on understanding and dealing with people. It's mostly common sense once you think about it, but I realised there were a few things I wasn't doing well. I'm now working on changing those. The most significant for me was remembering to think about what the other person in any given situation wants. I think that this will help me improve outcomes in many situations, even though it's by no means a panacea."
480,Farshad Asl,Awesome book...must read!!!
481,Paul Corrado,- One main point in book:People will think better of you if you talk to them or listen to them about things they are interested in rather then if you talk about how great you are or about things you are specifically interested in. In general people are interested in themselves. He tells a story in the book about one individual who listened to another person for an entire conversation and did not speak much at all. After the had the conversation the talker commented on the listener being a great conversationalist. The talker enjoyed the conversation because it was about them and felt that the listener was enjoyable to talk to because of this. - How this relates to view of the worldAsk people about themselves. I can learn about others point of views this way and have then leaving the conversation with a warm feeling. I have a tendency to point out the other side of an argument ( nicked name devils advocate by friends) and this can be less usefull if the goal is to win friends. The idea of listening to other people and making them feel important is a skill that is worth developing to both being a good friend and learning how to influence people ( ideally in a positive way). Over all i enjoyed the audio book and have listened to it a couple of times. once in 2004 and once in 2007. Probably a book worth re-reading every few years. 
482,Tony,Very well-written. Great examples are given thru out the book to give you an idea of how to use the tips. Overall this is book for those who want to be better at influencing others as well as speaking. 
483,John Nguyen,Must-read to anyone!!! I have read to three times to absorb its lessons and it may take me my whole life to practice those.
484,Jose Rosario,Awesome. A must read for everyone!!
485,Josh Ochs,One of the best books I've ever learned from on human interaction...
486,Linda M,"1983 - This was the very first ""business book"" I read. I was working for a corporation that offered Dale Carnegie courses at no charge to its employees (what a blessing!). Little did I know, this book would later sit prominently on the bookshelf of my own company when the one I worked for changed hands. It changed my life for the better."
487,Josh,"This a typical ""how to"" book but filled with an array of stories that anyone from a CEO to a middle manager can relate to. There are fascinating stories of people like Lincoln, Schwab, and Truman, among others, who have used the techniques to their advantage. A parent, president, or aspiring business student can all get the most out of this book. "
488,Deanna,Everyone should read this book. It offers great tips and examples of how to be a better person. If only I could implement them all immediately. I should probably read this book over and over again. 
489,W. Holmes,"Sounded Cheesy, but was recommended by literally every successful person's reading list I've ever seen. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger especially tout this book as a way to be effective even when dealing with assholes."
490,Raiya,Ini buku bagus! Wajib dibaca bagi orang-orang yang terpaksa harus berada di lingkungan yang kurang menyenangkan. Buku ini memberi petunjuk bagaimana kita bersikap dan menanggapi orang lain...
491,Mckennah Bybee,"How to win friends and influence people teaches you basically how to be a good person. It highlights three main points when dealing with people 1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain. 2. Give honest and sincere appreciation. 3. Arouse in the other person an eager want. This book doesn't have characters or a setting. This book give real life examples of why people act the way they act and how do deal with them. It also teaches you how to make people think the way you do, how to be a leader, and change people for the good.I picked this book because it was recommended to me by two different people. They said this book completely changed the way they though of things. One is a very successful business man and the other is a missionary. The way they think just blows my mind and makes complete sense. I read this book because I want to be like them. I think the book worked very well the way he explained things and gave real life examples. I like how he breaks things down into simpler parts. I like that in the beginning of the book he says to mark things so when you reread it you remember what stood out to you. I like that he gives you ideas and challenges. Most of all I like the way he thinks and what this book is really about. There was only a few things I didn't like about the book. First, at times it got a little to advanced for me and I didn't know what some of the words were. Second, some of the examples he gave were too old for me to really know about and they didn't help me understand what he was trying to say. My overall impression is that this book is amazing. I know I will continue to reread it throughout my life. It really does teach you how to be the kind of person you want to be. I think everyone should read this book. Although I don't think everyone should read it young, it's more something adults and mature younger people should read. This books is especially good for people who want to be successful in life not only in their job, but just dealing with everyday people. This book doesn't have any content that needs warning. "
492,Melissa,Questionable title but very good book.
493,Kimberly Smith,"A must read for EVERYONE living on planet earth who deals with human beings! Very useful, easy-to-read information.I wish I had read it before ever getting married! I'm already reading it through again with a pencil this time to underline passages. I am truly going to attempt to implement the principles in each chapter. "
494,Dino Price,"If I had no limits, I would give this books to every young person in hear shot."

497,Maya,"I really liked this book. I think that if everyone read this book, people's social relations with others would improve dramatically. There are so many great tips in this book, all stressing making the other person happy. If everyone tried to make the other person happy, imagine the great improvements people's relationships would have. However, I can see how this book would be controversial. Some people think that having principals on improving relations with others makes things not very genuine. However, Dale Carnegie stresses practicing these techniques in handling people over and over again until they become second nature. Then the habits in dealing with people you formed will come naturally. While reading this book there were so many instances where I thought ""If I did this, that situation would've been so much better,"" or ""If more people were educated about this, the world would be so much more pleasant."" Since reading this book and practicing the principals Dale talks about, I've already noticed a dramatic improvement in my relationships with others. I think that there are many great ideas that someone could take away from this book, and I'd recommend that everyone read it. "
498,Hasan Qureshi,Must read for anyone who wants to succeed in personal and professional life. The best book ever written on management.
499,Jonathan Monasterial,"Great read, full of information. Learn it and use it."
500,Jaycee Lam,"Great translation, really helpful"
501,Traci,everyone should read this book!
502,Andrew,"This is the most important book anyone will ever read, and constantly refer back to. "
503,Troy Hollabaugh,It was a great insight to how relationships work. It also gave me a better understanding of how to be more persuasive and still maintaining all core values. It is a must read for anyone in business or that deals with people on a regular basis
504,Nick Giddings,"The Book ‘How To Win Friends And Influence People’ By Dale Carnegie is a great informative read about learning how to deal with people and how to win people to your way of thinking. The author Dale Carnegie (rip) was an excellent author who not only just provided you with information on how to deal with people in certain situations, also gave excellent examples on how to do so. I find that every day I act and think differently based on reading this book.This book is divided into several parts all about how to deal with people, rather than influencing them to think like you, you change their mind by getting them to want to do it. There are 4 parts to this book, each with a large group of sub-chapters that sometimes overlap each other, but all together teach a different lesson the book starts with Part One. Fundamental Techniques in handling people, which is really just an overview of basic lessons and quotes to think about before you actually start the actual learning. Then the book really picks up when you enter part two. 6 ways to make people like you. This chapter is a good part about making friends ,making people like you and leaving a good lasting impression. Then we go over to part Three,.How to win people to your way of thinking. It is here where we learn more of the persuasion of the book where it shows how people think and how when they have made up their mind you really can't change it by force. Part Three, shows how to change people's thinking the right way without making them mad. This chapter is personally my favorite part of the book. Part Four. ‘Be a leader: How to change people without giving offense or arousing resentment’.This part was part about leading people and how to get people to like you and follow your command without being a jerk about it. This part really capitalises on the idea that everyone makes fault and no one likes to look at there own, but point out others this part helps you understand how beneficial it is to criticize yourself.Overall this is a great book and will probably be one of my all time favorites. It is a great read and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get ahead in their own lives and careers."
505,Wouter,Great book on interpersonal communication skills.
506,Andrea,I refer to chapters of this book often. Loved it!
507,Andrew Ye," In a documentary I watched on Warren Buffett, it said that when he was young he was not good at public speaking. He took a Dale Carnegie course and he says it influenced him a lot.I decided to read the book and see how this book can affect me. The advice in this book applies to everybody, and the advice is timeless because in every era you need to learn how to interact and deal with people.  One of my favorite quotes in this book is, “Personally I am very fond of strawberries and cream, but I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went fishing, I did not think about what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn't bait the hook with strawberries and cream. Rather, I dangled a worm or grasshopper in front of the fish and said: ""Wouldn't you like to have that?""Why not use the same common sense when fishing for people?""(Carnegie 145). This quote made a lot of sense to me and when you read the quote the first time it just makes an impression on you. “You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you”(Carnegie 120).These quotes probably takes a lot of experience to make and some people still ignores it and think what they do is right.  This book taught me a lot on psychology as well as interacting with people. This book can probably change many people's lives because the wisdom in this book can change your decisions and how you act. "
508,Sher Shah Rahim,"Amazing book, I hate reading books but when I started with this one it totally changed me. I was to read more and learn more about handling people.Thanks"
509,Malvina Molnar,One of the best book I've read in my life
510,Ben Jakuben,"I liked this a lot more than I thought I would! I thought it would be a tedious review of things I already knew. It was a review of things I knew, but it was a great review that wasn't tedious. Some things were particularly helpful to be reminded of as a parent. I didn't view the advice as tricking people into following you but rather working on one's empathy to understand others and move forward together."
511,Hamza,Very direct book with principles and steps to understand and influence people.
512,Mozhi Arasu,"step by step ...went through this course, I'll do what the author prescribed in preface- read again the points mentioned and put inside your head and stop violating from the principle, we need to follow up the things mentioned in the book, which is actually pretty straightforward with real life examples, doable and necessary for improving your relationship with people. i have my notes listing the principles for daily look through. it is not a book for the week or day, it is for your life so read the principle again and again to have a successful result."
513,Rahul Mahindru,"In today's world where human skills is the most important thing, we don't give much attention to it and do some stupid mistakes in daily life. This book will make you realize about some of mistakes that we do repeatedly and don't know the impact of it on our relationship with others. Author has tried to convince reader with examples takes from his students and great people from history. I loved some of points like1). With argument you might win, but you will loose a friend.2). Finding mistakes in others won't bring anything but appreciating them on small things and talking about your mistakes can bring lot of improvements.3). What you want no one cares so match your want with their want and you won't need to do anything else to get things done.4). My favourite 'If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you.5). Dont give orders, ask them questions.6). Show 'genuine' interest in others and they will always take care of you.7). Don't criticize, condemn or complain. Also never say, you are wrong and let the other person save face.8). Always begin with praise and honest appreciation."
514,Tim Kindem,"The title makes it seem much more nefarious than it actually is, which is a shame. I hope it doesn't turn people off. I found it to be a wonderful examination of how to have mutually enriching relationships with others."
515,Charles,"I have read this book twice before, but decided to read it again since a friend is reading it and I wanted to compare notes.Carnegie says criticising people will never work as people will always justify their behaviour. It is much better to reward good behaviour and to understand the other person. ----Finished reading it! The beauty of reading on the Kindle is that I highlighted the key points and will make a summary/ reference document. I may publish this on my blog.This book is certainly a classic on interpersonal communication and leadership."
516,Cassie,Very good book. Everyone should read!
517,Brian O'Rourke,"Goodbye, social ineptitude!"
518,Sherap Therchin,"This book is ever relevant. I intend to read it till I perfect it and I know I can never perfect it. So I am gonna read it for ever...till my eye sight doesn't fade away. Though most of the examples quoted are centuries old,it strikes chord with your so called contemporary times instantly. I wish I could thank Dale Carnegie in person. The world would be a better place to live in if everyone reads this book."
519,Emily,Be sure to read the non revised edition. The revised edition is missing a whole section on marriage.
520,J B ,"I was recommended this book about 20 years ago and have read it a few times since then and highly recommend it to anyone. To some, the title might suggest that this is a book on how to manipulate people to your way of thinking, but it is the opposite. It is a book on being a genuine, likable person by forgetting about your own selfish desires and becoming genuinely interested in others and their point of view, and showing it through how you act toward them. The book is broken down into a set of basic ""skills"" he describes through anecdotes from his own experience. The stories make the book interesting and entertaining to read, and help illustrate his concepts."
521,Matt,A must read for everyone in my opinion!
522,James Oliver,"One of THE classics in human communication and self-help books. A true classic. I first read this a long time ago and I need to re-read. Particularly the bit about criticising (don't do it) one's nearest and dearest.In a nutshell, the fundamental way to get someone to do what you want is to make them want to do it because they want to...There's a lot more on human psychology so go read it. It's an easy read.There is only caveat I would add: Not everyone will respond to the Carnegie method. Sometimes one has to guard against psychopaths and other malevolents that one comes across. All the 'seeing things through their eyes' in the world will not help... "
523,Dan,"Principles of dealing with people that are simple but often overlooked. Very dissimilar to many modern, aggressive, individualistic methods of success. The principles all develop from a sincere appreciation for others."
524,Michelle P,"such basic principles that really, any human should follow, but somehow we all forget. fantastic read and def a must-have for any in-home library. "
525,Mitchrice,A book that reaffirmed and quantified lot of things I have thought for a long time. Like the morning sun revealing a grain elevator you suspected was hidden in the morning fog the entire time. Great book. 
526,Ardi Rakai,bagus..buat melatih emosi dan bergaul yg efektif..Ini jg salah satu buku yg banyak berpengaruh dalam hidupku
527,Erin Galland,One of the first self-help books I read. Easy to read and understand and quite a few light bulb moments for me.
528,Richard Harbridge,A terrific book on how to be successful in both your personal and professional life.
529,Razvan Macovei,"I personally think it's one of the best books I have ever read in my life. Dale Carnegie wrote it in 1936 and it's still one of the best sellers of all times!It took the writer 15 years to actually write it because he did a very thorough research in the lives of many great leaders, philosophers and men of letters that had lived before him (ex: Jesus, Buddha, Julius Caesar, Shakespeare, Napoleon,Lincoln, Mark Twain, Edison, etc). The book is more like a collection of wonderful stories of how these remarkable men and many others reacted in different situations. The book teaches you how to cherish LIFE and how to nurture feelings of love and friendship towards others. Above all, it teaches you how to develop your emotional intelligence and senses of empathy. I can honestly say this book has changed my life, as I now have a better understanding of human nature. I think if at least half of the people of this planet read this book, the world would definitely be a better place!:) "
530,Theresa Chan,Had to read it for myself to see why a 1930s book is still so popular today.
531,Swapnil Warke,must read book 
532,Valerie Steimle,A great way for the socially inept to understand other people and get a long.
533,Brandon Rogers,"Was initially turned off by the title, but after hearing about the book and the author a lot i decided to give it a try. Was definitely not disappointed and it truly is practical advice. "
534,Kent Carpenter,"Wow! I hope this book changes my life. I feel like I should read it all again because i would be ashamed if I can't apply what Dale Carnegie is teaching. This book explains all the adroit mannerisms of social interaction in a simple way. It's full of numerous examples that highlight his suggestions to succeed in compromise, win friends, and influence people. I can not say enough about how excited I am with this book. "
535,Ann Hudspeth,"Title makes it sound lame, but it's influenced me deeply over the years. "
536,Rana,Great and easy to read. Another book that everyone should read.
537,С. Бат-Очир,Агуу карнегийн агуу ном. 
538,Andrew Weiler,A timeless classic that will always resonate
539,Cashman65,A great referance book.
540,Sundeep,Brilliant
541,George,Great book on practical tips of how to succeed in any scenario. I try to re-read at least once a year.
542,Kevin,"This book is amazing. It is now on my ""Books everyone should read"" list."
543,Ileana,Good common sense and practical guide to how to treat people.
544,Joshua Goddard,A genuinely fascinating insight into the social dynamics and psychology of winning people over to your way of thinking - would of loved to have met Carnegie!
545,Emma Stockdale,AWESOME. Changed the way I view all of my relationships. 
546,Marian Shelley,"Very, very, VERY good!! Definitely recommend this to any girl, whether they're a tween, teen, mid-teen, or late-teen. "
547,Alexandre Zara,If everyone reads this book the world would be a much better place to live in. Every one who wants to handle people better should read this one. For managers is a must reading. 
548,Nathan Burrows,"This is an excellent book that should be read by everyone. This will definitely put you on the right track with dealing with people. I think if everyone read and put this book into practice, we would probably have a world with less conflict and more personal growth. "
549,Libbey,"For all of those reviews that bash this book, I must ask myself, did they even read it? There are so many people who say that the book turns you into a ""people pleaser"" or a manipulator who ""uses"" your relationships. None of this is the case, Carnegie states (VERY frequently) that if you are not earnest, honest, and sincere in your attempts to win friends and influence people you will totally and utterly fail. Now off my soapbox and onward towards the positive, what I would like to highlight is that even after all the years since the book was originally written all of the same principles seem to ring true! I have been applying them as I have been learning them and, let me tell you, ALL of them WORK! I have used each and every principle to either smooth over a situation, get a person to come over to my way of thinking, or bring new and exciting people into my life as friends. I would suggest that everyone, especially those who have bashed it, read (or reread) this book and implement the rules and principles covered. Those who do will, most likely, lead happier, more harmonious, and more productive lives!"
550,Jacob Pogson,Long standing advice on communicating effectively with strangers and colleagues. 
551,Fathi,كتاب رائع وجميل وسقرأه مرة أخرى في القريب العاجل إن شاء الله
552,Gaurav Vimal,"Awesome book, one of the must to read.."
553,Bruce,Really helped me understand what I am already doing to be a good friend and where I can improve in my relationships. 
554,Dr-qamar,في الكتاب هذا طرق مفيدة وجيدةاشايء نتعلمها من غيرناتنفعنا وتفنع غيرناتحسي الكتاب يتكلم عن نظرة معينة بصراحة كتاب جيد انصحكم بيه
555,Krishna Kumar,"The techniques in this book are immortal. Dale Carnegie's book is very compelling 70 years later. The most important aspect of the book is that first and foremost, it is a book about sincerity and deep human values. Winning friends and influencing people comes first from genuine respect and caring for others. The book's techniques provide additional guidance in identifying blind spots in one's behavior that turn off people and create unnecessary friction. "
556,Emma,"Lots of very valuable information in this book. It all seems like common sense, yet not many people actually use these skills. It will take some time to implement them into my habits though.."
557,Simon W,Love the analogies and stories. Make perfect sense. Some were just repeating though or rather similar.I love the Lincoln references.
558,Mj,"I read this book years ago and remember how impactful it was on my life. What I remember most is the encouragement to take the first step in any relationship - to smile and say hello to the person who never says hello and always seems grouchy i.e. the person who you've been totally turned off of. What happened by taking the inititave just to smile and say hi, was amazing. Invariably, there was a return smile and instant connection. The next time, that same, so-called silent, grouchy person was smiling and saying hello first to me.If Dale Carnegie's advice seems simple, it is because it is. But his simple advice is also very wise. His message is basically treat others as you would like to be treated, don't judge anyone until you have a walked a mile in their moccasins and each of us has much more in common with every person than we can possibly imagine.This book is very positive and wonderful guide for living a kind and fulfilling life. It is well worth reading again and again because its message is universal and will never be out of date."
559,David,very helpful and my son loves it
560,Chris Holdgraf,"This book was surprisingly good. I assumed that it would be a bit hokey, what with the business world obsessing over it. However, underlying the whole book is a message that not only makes you successful with people, but also just makes you a better person in general. I'd definitely recommend reading it and trying to incorporate some of its ideas in the ways that you interact with others."
561,F.C. Etier,The granddaddy of self help books. 
562,Maseo15,"GREAT BOOK, WITH GREAT ADVICE."
563,Cynthia,"With this book, Carnegie created the relationship Bible. The advice he shared is just as relevant today as it was when the book was first printed. This is, in large part, due to the fact that Carnegie's understanding of the timeless aspects of human nature is so complete. This is a book that should be on everyone's bookshelf."
564,Vishal Verma,I am going to keep it in my personal library forever..
565,Alex Pricop,"Despite the book's name, that sounds really scheming, I wish more people would read this book, it has a lot of good advice on how to be a decent human being, friend and even life partner. "
566,Shafik Keshavjee,Read dozens of times Time to reread. Truly a classic. Turned me from a shy boy into a confident salesman!
567,Richard Arblaster,"Excellent book, a must read for anyone that wants to improve their lives.Don't be put off by the title, it isn't a manual for manipulation, totally ethical techniques that not only can help you, but can help others at the same time."
568,Dariant Virgi,"i have heard many comment about this book, suggestion and criticisms alike.but for me personally, i love it.dale carnegie tells basic principle of human relation that is so commonsense.. i don´t know why wouldn't i use it earlier.it acts more as a remainder then a lecturer.he also strengthen those principle with a true story that act as an evidence to proof that those principle is do work on business, as well as on family.i would recommend this book to my family and friends.it might not make them be a great public speaker.but at least it encourage them to be a nice person that we all love."
569,Max Nova,"One of the best books I've ever read. Much of this book is common sense, but Carnegie presents everything in very clear and engaging anecdotes. This book isn't really a book about how to be successful in business, but rather a guidebook on how to be successful in life. Carnegie puts a huge emphasis on being a good person. This is a truly inspiring book that changed the way I see people and the world."
570,Johnnyle,I have to admit that this book is amazing. It has completely changed my life in many aspects. Thank you Mr. Carnegie for publishing this book and changed millions of people's lives. Visit my blog for stories on how this book changed my life! http://yoursandmystory.blogspot.ca/

574,Edward Gichia,Two thumbs up! This book is timeless and a must read. There is a reason why it remains popular since 1936..
575,Sanjeev Sajjan,"Best book to start to Handle complaints, avoid arguments and keep our relations smooth and pleasant."
576,Charmaine Arellano,i want to read this 
577,Ammon Beckstrom,Currently re-reading this classic on human relations and communication. I'm enjoying it even more this time than my first run through it. This is the kind of book that should be re-read every few years. I'm amazed at how much I'd forgotten and how accurate and useful Carnegie´s observations are.
578,Jeff Nider,Awesome books. Principles are still relevant today!
579,Rupinder Kaur,There's a reason why this is a classic & must read in personal development world! It works! 
580,Ben,Everybody should read this book
581,Kathryn Chedgzoy,An old classic but still so true
582,Oumaima,"Great book- A must read for everyone who wants to improve his social skills..It's a useful book,it made me change many ideas and improve my skills as well..In my opinion,this book must be read for everyone working in Buisness,the book was very diversfied,from stories to conclusions..I really liked this book,and it's one of the most smart books i've ever read in self-developpement! I advice it to anyone who wants to be an efficient person,and a true leader..I wasn't bored in any page from the book,because every page ,every single word,was studied and well adapted,the traduction was very good! I think this book changed my life.."
583,Konstantinos,"In the beginning I underestimated the principles of this book. I considered them to be just a cheat sheet on how to become more ""like-able"". Well, basically it is that, but the author has put a great effort in convincing the reader about why these principles work. In the end I was thoroughly expressed from the examples the author users, and his style of writing. I now consider it to be a classic book in its field, well worth reading. "
584,Nic Keep,Great book for all managers and sales people! 
585,David Zhang,"There are a lot of intricacies behind the pithy aphorisms that are frequently repeated in this book. The scenarios and examples offer eye-opening windows to not just how to apply Carnegie's tips, but how human nature works at the ground level. Knowing what is core to human relationships is not only important in vocational success but in personal pursuits as well. Becoming someone who is genuine - that's the meaning of this book, and in a world where everything is becoming less and less, it's an important one"
586,Martin De boer,If more poeple would communicate using these principles our live would be a lot better.
587,Bryce Randle,"I have been meaning to read this book for a very long time and finally just bought the audiobook on iTunes. I quite enjoyed it and I can already see how it is helping me with my work, family and church responsibilities. I think everyone should read this book at some point in their lives. "
588,Sage,"It's Dale Carnegie, enough said! "
589,Christina Hibbert,"Fabulous book, with so many great insights to digest. Excellent for improving social skills!"
590,Jenn,"This is a great, logical book about dealing with people. It is not a book about being manipulative and mean to get what you want. It's about giving other people what they want and need and in return, you'll be blessed too. I like it because it's true. This is a good book to read and reread. (Incidently, I've read it several times over since I was a teenager.)"
591,Dina Maklad,"this book is incredible , its like a magic ,first i didn't know if what people saying about it is true , Is it really able to change your attitude? , how can a book do that? , How could those famous people just got through these things?... and now i have their experience ...... its also a non boring book , i read it more than one time and Now iam making notes just to remember the important advice and situations ....i hope people try this book and try to do exactly what is written in it "
592,Sharon,A good book for tips and techniques in working with people.
593,Heather,"Very insightful book, now if I could only heed the advice :) I took good notes which I plan on reading frequently and have this book on my 'to read again' shelf for a year from now."
594,Damos,Picked the book up for 99c & downloaded it on audio. Awesome stuff. May need another read for principles to really sink in. Potentially a life changing book but the reader must take the content seriously & be prepared to consciously put it into action.
595,Nancy Sherman,"This book is perfect , especially for the socially awkward such as myself. I've always had problems relating to people. Hopefully, by using the mentioned techniques I can build more fulfilling and meaningful relationships. It will be painful and take a lot of practice but I'll master it. "
596,Zahhroor,"I Read the translated version of the Arabic and it was very useful and fun =) "" Lovely book ^_^ "" "
597,Gage,"I plan to re-read this book until the pages fall out. I think it's a must read for anyone who has to deal with people on a daily basis, which is almost everyone. While the ideas in this book aren't that far from common sense, reading it will remind you of how to be better person. "
598,Jeri,"The title makes this sound manipulative. On the contrary, it is just full of good principles on how you should treat people at home as well as at work. It is a great study on human nature and I will definately read it again."
599,Sarah Haney,Super practical!
600,Chase Parsley,"A timeless classic. Carnegie is part mentor, part wise sage, and part historian. An inspiring book that should be on everyone who has to work for a living's shelf."
601,Steve Sarner,A business classic that is always a good refresher to end one year and start the New Year. 
602,Natalie,I found this helpful. I was glad to know that I already do some of the things he suggested. 
603,Dylan Hobrecht,"this is atleast the tenth time ive read this book, and its still giving me new knowledge!"
604,Maha,A very good book.. The stories are very rich and entertaining.. It Deserves to be read and reread... Especially the part about building leadership.. 
605,Furqan,"I think we should be given this book in high schools to read... It changed the way I thought about people, completely! A life changer for certain!"
606,Cole Simmons,"My second read-through of this timeless classic. Handling people is certainly an art, and is something that not nearly enough people (myself included) are adept at. Implementing just a few of these principles have helped my relationships dramatically. I will definitely be reading through it many more times in the coming years.The only downside to reading this is that to people not familiar with the book, you look like a psycho. "
607,Amrya,Great book 
608,Godiva Rachel,"This book is ESSENTIAL. If I were to memorize by heart a book, this would be one of them. I've read this numerous times and I always learn something new. Thank you Dale Carnegie! "
609,Jason Mathes,This is one of those few books in a lifetime that actually provide practical advice that isn't complete bullshit. If you don't read anything else in life? This should be in the top 10 of them.
610,Lazăr Alexandra,"""Un zambet transmite mult mai mult decat o incruntare"""
611,Greg Gates,This should be a must read to graduate from Elementary School and then Junior High School and finally High School. It should then be re-read every 5 or 10 years... 
612,Lille Sahar,أقرؤه للمرة الثانيةخمس نجوم مش كتيرة عليه
613,Wafa'a Al-ziadi,واحد من أعظم الكتب التي قرأتها وغيرت حياتي جذريًا
614,Princesshonor,This is a classic that I really do plan on re-reading. I thought I did well in communicating with people but this book is really genuine about how to treat people well and be sincere.Its written with great examples on how to use the tips in the book. 
615,Michael Grills,Just a reminder of how to live.
616,Jay,"Another must read for those who have careers that require a proper ""bedside"" manner."
617,Mandi Friedman,"I loved this book. I am naturally very task oriented, and so this brought so much clarity to me about what people love and they way they think. I feel more equipped to please people and bring more life and vivacity into the world! I am so inspired. Carnegie's points are applicable to my actual life. Even if you are naturally people oriented, this book teaches you how to improve on those qualities. It is all around helpful, and worthy of time in your busy schedule. It truly helps you want to love people. I recommend this book with any authority I possess."
618,Jan,"Another book everybody who considers themselves human, should read."
619,Sai Venkatesh,"author guides us with awesome examples, little stories rather than jotting down point ,like in professional books.I asure u this book will mould you in to a perfect human"
620,Katsunobu Yagi,"No wonder this book still sells millions of copy around the world. If you have some problems relating to human relationship, you will find a solution in this book."
621,Alberto Lucini,"Great book. A must read for anyone whose livelihood, happiness, and peace of mind depend on their interactions with people; which is really everyone. Probably the best book regarding how human psychology and sociology effect every aspect of your life."
622,Sathish Sekar,"Very eye opening. Dale Carnegie has captured the essence of efficient communication and compiled it into a neat, methodical manual. Each chapter is succinct and clear. The one-sentence summaries at the end of each chapter are also useful. Anyone who is placed in daily contact with people (small demographic, I know) should be reading this. The book discusses many conversational techniques that seem to be common sense but are usually overlooked. Carnegie tailors his advice to business situations but it is also good for personal relationships as well. As a college student (Business major) I understand how these communication strategies can prove useful in a corporate setting. I am glad that I encountered this book early in my life since I will be referring back to its material often.I have read the book twice as was suggested by the author and will continue to read it many times more. It is that indispensable and that is why it is still relevant over 70 years after its original publication. The only significant flaw was that many of the anecdotes were outdated by current standards, but again that is not the fault of Carnegie. Overall, this book is definitely worth at least a single read."
623,Ashish Aryal,Nope
624,Samantha Hennessy,One of the BEST books I have ever read. Read when I turned 20 and completely changed the way I communicated with others.
625,Lucas Remmerswaal,"I learnt how to not criticise condemn or complain! and lots of other handy tips. Dale Carnegie, is one of the classic self motivation guru's this book was first published in 1936 sold over 15 million copies."
626,Whitney,"Everyone should read this book every few years. Not because it is mind boggling, revolutionary, etc. But because it is a great reminder of how we should interact with people in everyday life. I liked all the stories."
627,Ayush Garg,"One word - ""Legendary"" that's it."
628,Nicolas Rotta,Really amazing book!
629,Grace,Creo que necesito leerlo unas 10 veces mas! Excelente libro!
630,Ken Hoekstra,Should be required reading!
631,Von Sowards,"Apart from the Book of Mormon and the Bible, this is one of the greatest book to make a person more christ-like and happy in this life.Dale Carnegie teaches that as we be nice to be people, listening to them, consider their point of view, appreciate what they do, help them in their goals, and smile that we will achieve what we want, and feel satisfaction for it.Read this book!"
632,Micah Elliott,"Paul Graham (Hackers and Painters) has mentioned that an important read for preparing to start your own business is How To Win Friends and Influence People. I'm happy to report that this gem from 1936 is timeless and truly life-changing. I believe Paul's reasons for the recommendation include: the importance of charisma, general rounding out one's personality, and finding ways to get responsiveness from people by making them feel good.My real intent in making this review is to get you to pick up a copy of this book and absorb every nugget, so your relationships will increase and improve.One complaint I have is that the table of contents does not very well summarize the maxims. They are, however, listed in a table at the end of each of the sections. I'll combine them here by their major sections.Fundamentals for handling people: Don't be critical. Be sincerely appreciative, not flattering. Arouse in the other person an eager want, by focusing on their needs instead of yours.Making people like you: Get others to do most of the talking. Listen well, and make them feel important. Then they'll feel so good about being listened to that they'll do anything for you.Win people to your way of thinking: Always start in a friendly way, and be dramatic! See things from the other person's point of view, and be sympathetic with that view.Leadership: Give lots of genuine praise, and be encouraging. Talk about your own mistakes first, and make his faults seem easy to correct. Ask questions instead of giving orders. Give the other person person a fine reputation to live up to, and let him save face.Some of the lessons in the book are especially challenging to apply; e.g., making other people feel like your ideas are their own. A fundamental part of an entrepreneur's livelihood is idea generation. But ideas supposedly are not terribly valuable on their own (it's the execution that counts), so maybe this maxim is still valid. This seems to underscore the importance of having a lot of trust in your business partner(s).I've noticed that a lot of people don't call me by my name; maybe just because it's slightly uncommon. I do make an effort to remember someone's name and use it with some frequency. It was encouraging to hear Carnegie underscore this. He's right -- it does feel good when someone addresses me properly.I'm going to change my approach to making requests of people. I have a habit of getting right to the point and immediately stating what I want and why. That's probably why so many of my requests go unanswered! A general theme in the book is that getting what you want involves some indirection. I.e., think of things from the other person's perspective and present things from an angle of how they are the beneficiary.Overall, lots of Carnegie's ideas are common sense, but it still was useful to hear him voice them. Some of the principles are not so obvious and I probably wouldn't have ever discovered them on my own. I toted this book around with me for a couple weeks and found that having the ideas fresh in my head greatly improved my interactions with people. For this reason, I think this book (or its summary) would be highly valuable to skim over before every important meeting."
633,Shay,This book is wonderful and timeless. The principles it teaches are easily applied to life situations and it has made me rethink the way I've been handling people. Its opened my eyes to a lot of behaviors that I've displayed that only hurt my relationships to people. I'm going to read this book at least once every year because it is so important to have these human relation skills. It has also been a great tool for combating anxiety issues.
634,Manas,"If you r a good person, this book will influence u to become a better person. Truly amazing. worth reading..."
635,Kyle,"Simple but practical principles to help you live a better, more fulfilling life. A book that I can see myself rereading a year or two from now."
636,Sean Cheah,"If only I had read this sooner! The advices in Dale Carnegie's How to win friends and influence people are easy to practice and hard to forget. It teaches how to resolve and avoid conflicts, as well as valuable leadership skills. Although winning friends may be from another era (Adding friends) might be more relevant, the lessons still apply today.As I was reading the book I realised the amount of conflicts I could have handled better and the amount of lost opportunities I've missed. I'll recommend everybody to read this at least once, especially the ones who have to work with people (very rarely do people work completely alone) or manage them. 10/10 would recommend and I look forward to catching up on his other books!"
637,Maximus,Fantastic. Super practical advice for handling the title.
638,Gordon,"6 stars. What every person should read at an early age and frequently re-read. Our lives (professionaI, family and personal) would all be so much more enjoyable and fulfilling. I wish I had read this in High School. It would have saved me many a hard lesson at West Point and as a young officer. Reading Dale Carnegie's examples from the classics and early 20th Century America, anyone will realize just how enduring his comments on human nature are and how relevant his lessons in leadership and getting the most out of people remain today. A must read for any military, civic or business leader."
639,Manas Saloi,Probably one of the most influential Professional/Life Advice books I have read in my early 20s along with Never Eat Alone and Lynchpin.
640,Drsireen Ali,الكتاب رائع و شيق جدا....استفدت كثيرا منه و سأطبق ان شاء الله ما تعلمته....انصح الجميع بقراءته و تدوين الملاحظات الهامة اثناء القراءة.
641,Emir Omeragic,"This book surely must be a classic. Although it's written quite a while ago, the main ideas of this book are still used to this very day. I believe anyone can find this book useful. It is simple, right to the point, including good examples.I also liked how the author mentioned the way this book is supposed to be read and used. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, no matter the age. I am looking forward myself to re-read it and come back to it's main points from time to time."
642,Anwar Mohamed,كتاب رائع جداً ..استفدت منه كثيراً.
643,Jackson Harvey,"It's not as Machiavellian as the name suggests. It should be called ""how to be a decent person"". It should also be mandatory for anyone teaching at any level, and on any subject. "
644,Gary Baker, Totally not about what most people think its about everyone should read this book the world would be a better place
645,Catherine Letendre,"Vous détestez lire des livres reliés au travail et souhaiteriez n'avoir qu'un seul ouvrage de référence à consulter en toutes situations? Ce livre est pour vous!Mon top 1 du meilleur livre de psycho/travail/relations humaines EVER!!! Le titre est toutefois trompeur, il aurait dû s'intituler quelque chose comme: ""Comment manipuler les gens de façon élégante et subtile"". Écrit en 1936 par un États-uniens, cet ouvrage ne passera jamais date car les êtres humains seront toujours les mêmes. Découpé en chapitres très courts, l'auteur va droit au but dans son argumentaire et donne une foule d'exemples très pertinents. Vous n'avez pas le temps de vous taper tout le livre? Aucun problème! 1 chapitre = 1 conseil! Lisez-le par morceau et essayez ses trucs! Moi je l'ai fait et avec un seul conseil j'ai réussi à changer l'opinion politique d'un ami!!Ce livre c'est de l'or en barre! Mais surtout ne le lisez pas, car je ne voudrais pas que vous appreniez tous mes trucs... ;)"
646,Ayush Agrawal,A Wonderful Book That Teaches Powerful Lessons for Business as Well as Home Life
647,Kenya,"Must read for everyoneHow different would our world be if people would read the Word of God and this practical and easy to apply book on the invaluable lessons of relating to others and making people feel important. I think if people were valued, appreciated and loved we would live in a more peaceful society. "
648,Andrew Lloyd,A must read for anyone with a pulse and a job. 
649,عبادة الحمصي,أروع كتاب قرأته في التنمية البشريّة وأعتبره أمّا لكلّ كتب التنمية الأخرى أكثر شيء أعجبني في الكتاب هو الأفكار الملخصة في نهاية كل قسم والتي تعتبر الزبدة والعصارة لذلك الفصلصدر للكتاب نسخ كثيرة مترجمة للعربيّة منها الرديئة والمليحة لكنّني أنصح بنسخة مكتبة جرير وبشدّة، فترجمتها قويّة ومتناسقة 
650,A,قرأته منذ مدة ليست بالقصيرةأذكر بأن الكتاب أثر فيني كثيرا 
651,Luz,Must read!!
652,Erin Waters,"This book is a great guide to improving human relations. As you read, you will find many opportunities to apply the lessons to your own life. Skills acquired while reading this book include: becoming a better listener, becoming less self-centered, discovering motivations of others and realizing we all basically want the same things out of life, how to tactfully go about getting the things you want from other people, avoiding unnecessary conflicts/confrontations, etc... Some of Carnegie's advice may seem like ""tricks"" or sales tactics used to essentially manipulate people, but I've found the results of practicing these principles to be positive. Anything which encourages harmony between myself and others is welcome in my life. I saw results immediately as I began to apply the lessons I learned from this book, and received positive, unsolicited feedback about my changing attitude and performance at work, and improvements in other relationships. Overall, very insightful and applicable. "
653,Rheal Gauthier,"I thought this was a really good book considering it was written in the 60's. Maybe there's an updated version, but there was language in there that i just didn't understand. What are Hollyhocks?"
654,Syifarah,"Buku yang amat sangat bagus, penting, perlu untuk dibaca dan juga langsung dipraktekkan dalam kehidupan kita. Terutama bagi orang yang ingin meningkatkan kualitas hubungan sesama manusia di semua segmen, entah itu di dalam keluarga, hubungan bisnis, maupun dalam sosial kemasyarakatan."
655,Emma Pemberton,Everyone should read this book.
656,Caroline,Still so relevant almost 100 years later!
657,Cris Lopes,"It is a great book that has tips that are always useful! I feel I should read it more often as it applies so much in life in general, not only in business. I really want to study this book."
658,Deborah,"Common sense stuff, but is so true! Some of it gets dry and I just skimmed it, but I found myself nodding and underlining. and Making comments in the margins...which i don't do."
659,elizabeth,"even though this was written in the 1930s, everything is still extremely applicable and timeless. and obvious! just not so obvious that you think of it yourself."
660,Khuram Malik,"This book should be taught in all high schools. I can't believe it's not part of the curriculum. If it was, we'd have a much better set of youth.That said, if you understand the power of one to one marketing, this is the defining book for it. You (essentially) don't need to read anything else."
661,Ken,This is an annual read for me.
662,Drew West,"Without a doubt, the single most important book I've ever read."
663,Charles Xu,"Illuminating read on how to deal with common social situations. What I don't necessarily agree with is the author's idea that everyone is a narcissist and dogmatic person. However, much of the book's content will behoove me when dealing with people and being a leader. Will definitely have to reread and review Carnegie's core principles to win friends and influence people."
664,Elizabeth,"Despite the dorky name, this book definitely influenced my life for the better. I was 16, and no one had ever told me that you might make people like you if you smiled at them when they were talking. Revelations!"
665,Mathias Luz,"That book has showed me has to be a better, pleasing and kind person!Must read of self-development literature!"
666,Diddier,"If you want to learn about leadership, start with this book."
667,Bill Nelson,I have read this book no less than 6 times. It is one of the most influential books in my business life. 
668,Joe,"First read May 27 - July 26, 2014. Second read was listening to audio book, May 2015. Terrific book about how to be a better, nicer person.Despite the gimmicky title, a phenomenal book that should just be titled ""How to be a nice person.""One of my three books I think EVERYONE should read. "
669,Maureen,I wish all people would take the time to read this book!
670,Jon,Read it in high school and re-read it again a few years ago. Love this book.
671,Valerie,This is one of the best books I've read. It helps me to change the way I communicate and think. It's really hard to apply but I am willing to do it if I want to be successful in life. :)Highly recommended. :)
672,Peter Finnie,Must read!
673,Corey A. Jones,Wow! What a book. It's hard to believe it was written so long ago. This is really a must read for everyone who cares about relationships...which should be everyone. Dale just forces you to think about how everyone percieves your actions and words. It's really a guide humble communication. I will make this required reading for my employees.
674,ZIyad,One of the must-read in your life.
675,William Decker,"This book is one of those books where you will read the advice and think ""Duh, that is so simple."" and then realize that you have not been following that advice very much. The book covers many different types of interactions with people and each chapter begins with a simple goal such as ""Win People to Your Way of Thinking"" and then spends each section expounding upon a simple principle that can be summed in a simple sentence such as ""Get the other person saying 'yes, yes' immediately."" Through out section, Carnegie sprinkles stories involving ordinary people and famous people and how they use that particular principle to influence people. Interestingly, the book is written in such a positive fashion that you don't really consider the unethical uses of the principles. The emphasis all the way through out the book is gaining a deeper empathy for your fellow human beings and how to avoid/resolve conflicts. The book is a breath of fresh air compared to some of the Pick Up Artist or Sales Techniques modern books on persuasion. After reading this book, you will genuinely want to go out and influence people to make the world a better place.My favorite quote from the boo was when Carnegie is talking about one of the strongest drives that a human being has is the desire to feel important. In middle of tlaking about how this can be used to influence people (especially their first impressions of you), he drops a little statement that is much deeper than it orignally appears. He says, ""If you tell me how you get your feeling importance, I'll tell you what you are."" From that simple little sentence comes an easy to use heuristic that can let us understand other people's behavior that we find so baffling. When I was reading the book, this statement smacked me between the eyes like a sledgehammer and I had to stop reading to be able unpack what the statement really means. All too often we focus too closely on just the actions or the results of those actions for a person, that we never attempt to uncover why they are doing something. You can have two people doing the same thing for completely different reasons and then they both do the exact opposite and it can be quite baffling. This is isn't a big deal, we all know this, but the reasons that people do things are tied strongly to what makes them feel important. And important in this case has a very broad definition outside of famous or well known or popular, people derive all sorts of feelings of importance from doing things that will never be seen by the vast majority of other people. They seek to find their reason for existence and the purpose of their life. If you can figure out where they get their importance, how they place themselves in the universe, then your words can resonate deeply with them. "
676,Sharath Reddy,"This book has motivated me in many ways. When someone did something good or bad, I used to think.. ""What would I do If I'm in their's place ?"". Now I'm thinking like.. I would do the same thing if I'm in their place."
677,Victor Faletutulu,"no doubt the Best book on interpersonal relationships. if you want to be a leader of any organisation, church, etc this book is a must read "
678,Rita Stradling,"It's hard to rate this book, instead I'll call it... essential. "
679,Charlotte Glow,This is a must read for people who have to interact with other people (a.k.a. everyone)
680,Erin,One of my favorite books
681,David Richardson,I thought it was an amazing guide to help someone without the natural skills to function within the sensitive office political domain. Highly Recommend it!
682,Jeacques,An incredibly insightful and useful book that will change my life for the better
683,Danny McGuffin,Really changed my life. Very basic tenets that people should naturally follow. I honestly cannot commend a book more and have gone out of my way to suggest others read this marvelous book. 
684,Juarez Junior,"This is my #1, favorite book of all times. I have no words to recommend it, if you have never heard about it you must read it and follow all the advices by heart. I do recommend it, a classic!"
685,AmyLyn,"I just re-read this with my kids and though some of the examples and ideas are outdated, overall, the concepts are absolutely genius. I have already seen a huge change in the way our kids deal with each other, with me, with others, and with how I interact with others also. We will probably re-read this book every few years."
686,Eric,"A must read, great people skills book"
687,Dimi,Simple yet profound.Great guidelines and rules for handling your interactions with people in all areas of life.The best book on interpersonal relationships.
688,En Lerk,Great read that will definitely help in life
689,Brandon Perry,"A lot of great wisdom in this book. In fact I took the highlights and put them into the notes of my phone so that I can review them on a regular basis. We are working with people on an everyday basis, whether it be in a personal business, family or even an employee at some store we shop. This book offers that practical wisdom that helps you to understand people, therefore allowing you to work better with them."
690,Lamech Mariita,One of the most influencing books I've ever read. It really gets you thinking about your actions. Dale has changed many lives through this book. It's on many top 100 lists. I recommend it to everyone. It's definitely a must-read.
691,L.L.,"Z książki mam całą masę notatek, wszystkie zasady zamierzam przepisać (lub wydrukować) i zaglądać do nich często, ale tutaj nie będę ich przytaczać. Tutaj przytoczę tylko kilka dobrych cytatów.""Raz źle zrobiłem, krzyczeli wciąż na nowo, Zrobiłem dobrze dwakroć — nie padło ni słowo.""""Latem w Maine często chodziłem na ryby. Osobiście bardzo lubię truskawki ze śmietaną. Odkryłem jednak, że z jakichś dziwnych powodów ryby wolą robaki. Kiedy więc szedłem na ryby, nie myślałem o tym, czego chcę ja. Myślałem o tym, czego potrzebują one. Nie nadziewałem na haczyk truskawek w śmietanie. Zamiast tego umieszczałem przed rybim pyskiem robaka lub konika polnego i pytałem: „Czyż nie o to właśnie ci chodzi?"" Dlaczego nie kierować się tym samym zdrowym rozsądkiem, kiedy „łowimy"" ludzi?""""Dlaczego mamy mówić o tym, czego sami chcemy? To dziecinne. I bez sensu. Oczywiście, że interesuje cię to, czego chcesz. Interesuje cię to wiecznie. Ale innych nie interesuje to zupełnie! Niczym się od ciebie nie różnimy: interesuje nas to, czego chcemy my!""Właśnie za takie cytaty jak dwa powyższe uwielbiam Carnegiego.A poniższy cytat też jest bardzo dobry, kiedyś zapewne przytoczę go w notce.""Cokolwiek zrobiłeś od dnia swoich narodzin, zrobiłeś, ponieważ chciałeś. Pytasz o dzień, w którym przesłałeś sporą dotację dla Czerwonego Krzyża? To też nie jest wyjątek. Przeznaczyłeś pieniądze na Czerwony Krzyż, ponieważ chciałeś podać komuś pomocną dłoń, chciałeś dokonać pięknego, altruistycznego, świętego czynu. „Cokolwiek uczyniliście jednemu spośród tych braci moich najmniejszych, mnieście uczynili."" Gdybyś bardziej pragnął pieniędzy niż tego szlachetnego uczucia, nigdy nie przesłałbyś tej dotacji.""""A jednak równie często jak ja spotykasz ludzi, którzy idą przez życie usiłując wszelkimi sposobami zwrócić na siebie uwagę. Oczywiście, to do niczego nie prowadzi. Ludzie nie interesują się tobą. Nie interesują się też mną. O każdej porze dnia i nocy interesują się wyłącznie sobą.""Powyższy - po raz kolejny potwierdza tylko to samo. Ale lubie sobie to uświadamiać :PA poniższe dwa... warto o tym pamiętać.""Zachowuj się tak, jakbyś już był szczęśliwy, a zobaczysz, że faktycznie będziesz szczęśliwy. Oto co pisze o tym filozof i psycholog William James: „Działanie wydaje się iść za uczuciem, ale w rzeczywistości działania i uczucia są równoczesne. Regulując działanie, które znajduje się pod bardziej bezpośrednią kontrolą woli, możemy pośrednio wpłynąć na uczucia, które nie są kierowane przez wolę.""""Ilekroć wychodzisz na zewnątrz miej radosną minę, noś głowę wysoko, jakbyś miał na niej koronę, i do samego dna nabieraj powietrze w płuca. Upijaj się słońcem, witaj znajomych uśmiechem i w każdy uścisk dłoni wkładaj całą duszę. Nie obawiaj się, że zostaniesz źle zrozumiany, i nie trać ani minuty na myślenie o wrogach. Spróbuj jasno nakreślić sobie w umyśle cel, do którego zmierzasz, a potem skieruj się tam bez zbaczania z drogi. Nie przestawaj myśleć o wielkich i wspaniałych rzeczach, które chcesz zrobić, a wraz z upływem dni przekonasz się, że podświadomie chwytasz wszystkie sposobności do spełnienia marzeń, tak jak koralowce wychwytują z przepływającej fali wszystkie potrzebne im składniki."":)""Pamiętaj, że ludzie, z którymi rozmawiasz, stokroć bardziej przejęci są sobą i swoimi problemami niż tobą i sprawami, które de trapią. Ból zęba znaczy dla każdego więcej niż głód, który w Chinach zabija miliony ludzi. Problem, który musimy rozwiązać interesuje nas bardziej niż czterdzieści trzęsień ziemi w Afryce. Pamiętaj o tym, kiedy następnym razem rozpoczniesz konwersację.""""Czy chciałbyś poznać magiczną formułę, która rozstrzygnie spory, wyeliminuje złość, spowoduje dobrą wolę i sprawi, że rozmówca będzie de słuchał uważnie? Chciałbyś? Dobrze. Oto ona: „Nie winię cie ani na jotę za to, co czujesz. Gdybym był tobą, bez wątpienia czułbym to samo."" Takie stwierdzenie zmiękczy nawet najbardziej swarliwego rozmówcę pod słońcem! A możesz to powiedzieć i być stuprocentowo szczery, ponieważ gdybyś był na miejscu tej drugiej osoby, z pewnością myślałbyś tak jak ona.""Powyższy też jest dobry...""Antoine de Saint-Exupery napisał: „Nie mam prawa robić ani mówić czegokolwiek, co pomniejsza człowieka w jego własnych oczach.

692,Jonathan Phares,"I read ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" as homework for the Dale Carnegie class ""Breakthrough to Success"". This book is an excellent toolkit for getting what you want out of life and work. The principles are practical and effective. I've put many of them into practice at home and at work, and have enjoyed better relationships and quicker project turnaround. I recommend you read it. Moreso, I recommend you follow Dale Carnegie's rules for dealing with people. You will see immediate results. "
693,Kody Farnsworth,Every person should be read this book multiple times in their life. Your success in life will be directly correlated with your ability to communicate and build relationships. The rules of this book should be memorized until they are engrained with your everyday thought processes. I have seen lists of over-hyped books with this book on it. I feel like those writers are trying to do something outrageous to get people to read their articles. This book was decades ahead of it's time when management viewed people as things to be controlled. 
694,Joe Petrini,Interesting stuff. Probably will read this once a year
695,Quinn Ouellette,"I believe, if read thoroughly, this book can act ask an incredile source of advice. Upon getting hired for my job, I was required to read this book. Though I was somewhat frusterated that I was essentially being forced to read, my mood quickly changed once I realized how great the book was. Carnegie does an impressive job of offering real-life examples in order to make his insight both relateable and sincere. I plan to read this book several times throughout my life."
696,Vandry,One of those books that you walk away a better person from. Truly empowering. Pick it up and change your life.
697,Linda Barton,"A really great book that I read years ago. The main concept is something you can put into practice: to actually be interested in other people, what they are saying, etc. will win you friends and influence people. It may, however, work too well. If you are always the good listener, and interested in others, you may attract many people who love to talk, indeed are compulsive talkers, and will take up all your time!!"
698,Julie Carratt,"I have seen this book many times in book shops but the title always put me off, I thought it sounded a bit 'sales gimmicky'. It is a must read for anyone who manages people and psychology students. Although it is an old book the examples given still make it an interesting read. It is basically about treating people with respect, putting yourself in their shoes, and being sincere with praise. I wish I had read it when doing my behaviour diploma as it would have made an excellent reference tool. "
699,Alex Arner,Absolutely amazing! This book has literally changed my life! 
700,Joshua Dror,"Awesome book, a must read for any professional "
701,Mathew Vicknair,Well written and with precise exercises on how to do exactly what the title says
702,Philip Pierce,"I'm on the last stretch of this book, and what I've learned thus far has been the most practical and enlightening insight to the day-to-day workings of social psychology I've ever come across. Everyone, everywhere, could benefit tremendously from the lessons and advice in this book."
703,Rhonda Howard,"I read this years ago. Guessing at the date. I revisit it occasionally just because it made me more tolerant of other people's views. I would say it is one of my favorite informational books, if not my favorite. I also like John Wooden.""You can be right, or you can be kind."" I am not sure if this was in the book, but I think it captures a lot of what I got from the book. There is much more, I'm sure, but my memory............."
704,Amro Almrghlany,مهم لكل شخص مهتم بالسلوك البشري وتطوير الذات والقيادة كتاب يغني عن عشرات الدورات من دون مبالغهشامل ل( القيادة ، فن الاقناع ، فن التواصل ، صناعة بيئه محببه للنفس ، التسويق ، فن الانصات ، ازالة المشاعر السلبية وامور اخرى كثيرة )
705,Branden Driver,One of the most influential books I think I've ever read. It has truly helped me understand how to deal with people better and how to make others feel better about themselves. A book I will always recommend. 
706,Patrick,"A must-read for anybody of any age. I should have read it fifteen years ago. After you read it, re-read it. "
707,Ahmad Husseini,Amazing book that changed my life
708,Peter Lai,Must re-read this. 
709,Tony Jr.,"Definitely a must-read for everyone. Probably one of the most practical, helpful and insightful books I've ever read. A classic work indeed."
710,H.Y.P.E.,Great read!Great read!this book taught me things that I wouldn't learn anywhere else! definitely recommend to anyone that wants to learn how to become a better leader!
711,Teresa,Useful information. Key point - put yourself into the other person's shoes. People have a need to feel important. Cater to this. Would read this again to refresh memory.
712,Abdallah El-Shafe'y,one of the best books you will read
713,Widyoseno,the best book for leaders
714,الهنوف,من أجمل كتب تطوير الذات، اعطاني ماكنت احتاجهيلخصلك قواعد أساسية في التعامل مع الناس تكسب محبتهم وتؤثر فيهم.طريقته جميلة فقبل كل قاعدة يسرد قصص واقعية على مر التاريخ قائمة على هذه القواعد ليبين لك مدى أهميتها وفاعليتها.انصح الجميع بقراءته وتدوين القواعد ليطلع عليها دائما.
715,Lynsey,"The person who recommended this book needs to be given a hand clap that can be heard around the world. Literally. We read books that not only teach us how to perfect our craft, but our character as well. How to Win Friends & Influence People by Dale Carnegie is highly recommended text for those looking to improve their attitudes towards people and especially potential clients. The main rules to learn in this book are:The six ways to make people like youThe twelve ways to win people to your way of thinkingThe nine ways to change people without arousing resentmentHow to… is a book we plan to keep on our desks as a personal character bible when certain situations arise. The most important lesson we both learned was remembering a person’s name is the sweetest and most important sound in any language. In other words, don’t perceive your clients as just that; your “client”. They do have a name. Respect it. Live it. Remember it."
716,andrew mcgraw,"Amazing that this book was published in 1936. It's amazingly replete with insights into human nature that are spot on. Mostly intuitive, but chock full of anecdotes and stories that support his points. If you interact with human beings you should probably read this book."
717,Amber Miller,loved it
718,Adriane Devries,"Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence people is the enduring self-help classic, written originally 1937 to wild acclaim, that keeps on giving charmingly charismatic advice for success in both work and society. Focusing on other people’s strengths and striving to genuinely like and show interest in them, we win their admiration and trust. Then we can make them do stuff! It’s not really that easy, of course, but this book is a refreshing reminder to use encouragement rather than the intimidation which only engenders resentment, to deftly nudge others around you into becoming the best they can be, which is, let’s admit it, your minion! While reading this, I often thought to myself that it was like a paraphrase of so much of Jesus’ teachings, that we should love others unconditionally (sometimes requiring extensive use of our imaginations), that the first would be last, that we should give of ourselves to extremity without thought of what we would gain, and that others would follow and do even greater things as a result. By applying these principles, which still seem to go against to our natural negative inclinations despite evolution and modern science and all that, we all would win, wouldn’t we? If yes, then click like on this review!"
719,Cassie Cox,"I work with hundreds and hundreds of people every year, so I figured this book could do me no harm. From beginning to end, I was hooked. The principles in here are really common sense principles, but it's good to be reminded of the power that our words and actions have on others. As a teachers is so important that I ""win over"" my students--quickly! This book gave me the tools I need to do just that. I believe this is a must-read book for everyone."
720,Positivism1,Absolutely this is the best book on friendships/relationships and how to interact with people ever.
721,Briostheman,"So obvious, but overlooked"
722,Larisa Popa,"Even though it was written so many years ago and some of the examples he gave might seem a little curious now, the principles still apply and it's a simple and fun way to improve your social skills and get to master human relationships."
723,Manoj Arora,"My learning:(1) If you disagree with someone, you may be tempted to interrupt. But don't. It is dangerous. They wont pay any attention to you. They still have lot of ideas crying to find their way to expression.(2) Dont you have more faith in your own ideas than those offered to you on a silver plate? If yes, then it applies the same way when we offer our ideas to others. Offer ideas only if asked, and even after that, retract and let them make their own decision.(3) A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall. Speak softly. Be polite.(4) Humility and praise, when rightfully used, can work miracles in human relations.(5) Praise is like sunlight to the warm human spirit. We cannot grow without it.(6) We might do the same thing as others, given the same circumstances.(7) Teaching children to count is important. Teaching them what counts is critical.(8) Even God does not judge. Who are you and me?(9) The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to feel important. Make people feel important and they would do anything for you.(10) Be lavish in appreciation. People will cherish and treasure your words, and repeat them till years after you have forgotten them.(11) the rare individual who unselfishly tries to help others has little competition in this world. He need not worry about his future.(12) You can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people that you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.(13) People are not interested in you and me. They are interested in themselves. When you see a group photograph that you are in, whose picture do you look at first?(14) There is nothing either good or bad. Our thinking about it makes it so.(15) A person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.(16) When your child talks to you, stop everything else and listen. There is nothing more respectful and lovable as listening.(17) Many people call a doctor when all they need is a good audience.(18) Any fool can try to defend his or her mistake, and most fools do."
724,Julio Lins,In opinion the concepts in this book should be taught in school. 
725,Alicia,A classic - life lessons and examples from Abraham Lincoln still apply to life today. 
726,Rich Gray,"What a wonderful book! So much of the world is full of negativity anymore. This book, though dated in its examples, is a refreshing guide to life and interacting with others. I HIGHLY recommend this book to everyone, but especially those whose vocation requires working with other and leadership."
727,Dana Farmer,"What can I say...this is an amazing book! Truly a book about finding the best in others and encouraging them to be the best they can be, which in turn benefits everyone. Very inspiring!"
728,Sean,"Standards to live by, I'd recommend this to anyone who wonders why they have no friends."
729,Ravimohanv Ravi,A book every one must read.This should be part of school curriculum.
730,Steven Wan,Extremely powerful and numerous tips that I will be using for everyday life
731,Jay Nair,A classic which may never lose its edge. A book full of examples of how famous personalities/individuals influenced. Many simple and effective tools are mentioned towards building long lasting relationships.Surely a primer for anybody interested in connecting with people.
732,Mark Tilchen,I have been in business for 35 years and I recomend this book to all new managers. It goes to the heart of what business is all about - people.
733,Sébastien,Livre très intéressant qui cache beaucoup plus de ressources que ce que ne laisserait penser le titre.Un certain nombre de principes à mettre en oeuvre pour se sentir mieux avec soi et avec les autres :)
734,Chantelle,"Not as manipulative as it sounds, more about self improvement. A lot of the points you would think are common sense but...Anyway, I thought the author wrote splendidly plus he really did his research which helped to back up his points. I especially liked this book because I read one of the first editions published so it was neat to see some of the different cultural aspects at the time come out in the writing (which I assume are edited out in the other editions) "
735,Akif,Classic. Enough said.
736,Sisouma Islem,it's really nice to know yourselves guys !
737,Keri,"This book is a must read for anyone who will communicate with others - personally or professionally - at some point in their life. In other words, this book is for everyone.This is the absolute BEST book I have ever read for evidence-based (research and practical) suggestions on how to effectively communicate with the people in your life. Carnegie provides real life examples and scenarios from historical (as well as personal) experiences that clearly and humorously illustrate how to positively influence others and achieve win-win results.I couldn't put this book down! It is the only self-help/business book I continually refer back to while consistently implementing the suggestions (with success).This book has improved my interactions with everyone in my personal AND professional life. It truly has changed my life for the better."
738,João Ricardo,Livro muito dinâmico mas com conceitos complexos. A aplicação é essencial juntamente com a releitura regular para a fixação dos mesmos.
739,Michael Pagan,"This book is a must read on human relations. It explains the value of understanding people from an empathetic point of view. It not only helps you improve yourself, but it enhances the way you can treat others."
740,Celeste,This is a book I must read every year. Really helps to read this in order to keep communication open and positive.
741,Lindsey Turnbaugh,I think that EVERYONE should read this book! It is amazing
742,Audrey,"Fantastic! I loved all of his suggestions. Most of them seen like common sense because the author suggests well-known behaviors such as smiling, complimenting others, listening sincerely, and asking good questions. But, the stories he uses to exemplify each principle are very interesting and convincing. I'll have to read this book again sometime to refresh. "
743,Ronica,LOVED it! EVERYONE should read this! 
744,Avtar Singh,Dale Carnegie Classic. Must read for all. The way i see it its a great programme to be followed to get better. 
745,Vikesh Ramtohul,Big things have small beginnings....Changing our behaviour with small steps will lead to a better world. A must read!!
746,Bob Pollock,I'm beginning this book for the third time in four years. It's that good.
747,Beez Beasley,Reminders of how to live your life....and be a better person. Should be read more than once.
748,Jeremy Morgan,"My all time favorite book. Read it so many times I lost count. I try to apply more and more of what's in it as time goes on, I'm not always successful at it but I always try. The advice contained in it really does work if you have the discipline to apply it. "
749,Effendy Yahaya,"I love it. Right to my noose. Never thought it was the art of learning behavior on human beings. Its simple but yet so complex for a human beings, affectionate by their needs. My bedtime read, after stress reading on financial and economic. Interesting, for now and future, always forever. Thanks."
750,Kent,classictrue classicthis is what Seven Habits and all books like it are based i will read this again and again - its lessons are timeless
751,Stephen,"This book gets hated on sometimes, but I found it at a time I was struggling with my sense of confidence with other people, and it was just what I needed."
752,Toan Bui,my life follow this book
753,LATOYA SAUNDERS,"I reread this book every so often because it is just so illuminating. If you ever have to deal with people, ever, this book is for you. "
754,Mohammed Issat,"Brilliant book, helping you understand and thus influence the behaviour of others"
755,Abdulrahman Aldawsari,كتاب اساسي لمن يريد النجاح في حياته.كتاب يعلم الدبلوماسية و الحكمة و الحلم.يجب ان تقرأه.
756,Molly Cecile,"As corny as the title might sound, this book should be a must-read on everyone's list. After reading this book I am so surprised that schools don't teach the simple methods for people to get along with each other and have less conflict. On top of it, any person going into any sort of business must read this. The advice that this book gives is more valuable than a college education on business. While reading this book, I've already had a lot of success, whether it's dealing with work, friends, or family. There's nothing to lose, this book was enjoyable and fast and on top of it, I read every single chapter twice-over and took notes, as Dale Carnegie suggests in the beginning of the book and I would suggest the same thing to anyone planning on reading it. Don't miss out - it's like a manuel to life.""Compared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake."" (from Pt. 4, Chapter 6)"
757,Kierston,"love it. well written, simple and spot on"
758,Sarah Messenger,I need to read this and reread! 
759,Shalva Tandilashvili,“The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.” How to Win Friends and Influence People - One of the best books I have ever read.
760,TURKI ALHARTHI,A must book
761,H,Without which I may still be friendless. 
762,Arif Adli Suhaimi,give me motivation onhow to win mad'u ^^
763,Patrick Bergen,"Very, very useful to someone as socially ignorant as me."
764,Filip Matous,Essential read alongside Influence by Robert Cialdini.
765,Ville,"Very clearly focused, achieve the goal as defined by the title of the book, by increasing the awareness of how other people judge. Attempts to help not be rhetoric, but by actual improvement of characteristics such as diplomacy, felling and expressing genuine appreciation of other people."
766,Adam Tiam,"One of the most helpful books you'll ever read, whether you think you need it or not"
767,Marc Josef,"Quite possibly the best sef-help/motivational book that I have read.The concepts and ideas provided are very simple. However, it is the simple things in life that we tend to forget. Everyone at one point in their life should read this book because it will only help them become a better person.Although, the book was published in 1936, the ideas are still highly applicable more than ever in today's world.There is a reason why this book has sold 15 million copies world-wide!"
768,Felix,"A book that can make you befriend people, and yourself!"
769,Jeevin Gill,One of the most helpful books every to help you avoid arguments.
770,Geoff,"6 star book, best one I've read since Thomas Sowell's Basic Economics.Applicable advice for dealing with people. While not mentioned specifically by the author, many of his points come from Biblical principles. Biggest take away..no point in arguing with someone and try to prove them wrong. This will only cause them to ""dig in"" in their position. Their pride will then be involved. Author postulates that arguing is a lose-lose proposition. Even if you ""win"" the author person will resent you. You cannot win an argument and its best to avoid them, even if you are right. Author uses examples from 1900s-1930s. Charles Schwaube maybe worth reading about. Also, Dale Carnegie reference Lincoln frequently. He even wrote a biography about him. This is probably worth reading as well."
771,Allen,"@Allen: This book did NOT change my life. It says a whole lot of things that I would hope most people will learn through trial and error while growing up. I was already in my mid thirties by the time I came around to reading it.I'm also pretty sure that I would not have taken this book very seriously when I was still a young man, either.However, this did help me tune my knowledge. It helped me realize that certain habits I have are particularly useful when dealing with others, and it helped me realize that certain habits that I don't have are still things that I, even now ... five years later ... still need to do more to work on.For me, the biggest help was the book explaining that ""I am bad with names"" is NOT an excuse to not remember them. I absolutely recommend this book, but I warn that it is a self-improvement book. You have to WANT to work on your own betterment to get any value at all from it."
772,Easy Projects,"Project management is essentially people management. Without the right social skills, you’re going to be more dangerous to your team than effective. This classic book on social interaction is still as relevant today as when it was released over 80 years ago. Not only will you learn how to make yourself accessible to and valued by others, but you’ll also become a better manager because of it."
773,Taher,most helpful book on communication with people 
774,Shiloah,"Written almost 80 years ago and it is still as useful today as it was when it was written. I truly believe everyone should read this book. My only regret in reading it, is not reading it years ago. It has changed my perspective in my relationships with all people and really has opened my eyes to the truths of human nature.Second reading/ all people who have relationships with people need to read this book. It's applicable not only in business, but for families & marriages as well."
775,Justin Maynard,This was a great book and I recommend it to everyone. 
776,Rosen Wong,"This book is awesome, one of my favourite. I didn't read this edition yet, but did read the Chinese edition, which already gave me tons of inspirations, and changed my attitude of communication and social activities. Now I am able to understand the right way for conversation, and makes me think more too. I love this book, surely one of the must-read books here on earth."
777,Grant,"What did I learn??? Smile, learn from other people (get to know them), be what I want people around me to be like and people really do want to talk to you... they are probably just as scared as you are (that may have been from another book but I think it is from this one... lol)!"
778,Mark Mitchell,"Dale Carnegie's classic has a deservedly fabulous reputation. The title does indeed capture the intent of the book; it's a pragmatic how-to manual for getting people to like you and do what you want. It is thus a self-help book, no different from any other self-help book about advancing your career or succeeding in life. But, pleasingly, because the advice largely consists of being genuinely nice to people (giving praise whenever possible, listening to what other people have to say, and so forth), the book is really about constructing so-called ""win-win"" situations, in which you get what you want and everyone else is happy that you did. So, it's a book about being selfish and generous at the same time. What a pleasing idea for any aspiring capitalist who fancies himself or herself a moral human being! I find it very pleasing that Carnegie emphasizes that your words and actions must be genuine (praise) rather than false (flattery). While the writing style may seem a little dated, and the claims that these techniques are the only ones overblown, the advice given is as valuable today as it was when the book was first published in 1937. It's tempting to dismiss it all as obvious, and, indeed, much of the wisdom in the book has passed into the realm of conventional wisdom amongst professional business people. But, while I find myself saying ""I do that"" often enough, I certainly also found myself saying ""Oh, I know I should do that, but sometimes I don't"" even more often. And, by having all the ideas in a single book, and uppermost in my consciousness, I've found that I'm trying hard to build relationships on a daily basis. (Just yesterday, I decided to try to make friends with Eugene, who came to repair our stove, and with some success...)Given the importance of personal relationships in business -- and, for that matter, in life -- if you haven't read this book, you should do so now. And, if you have read it, it's probably time to read it again; I plan to read it cover-to-cover on an annual basis."
779,ToastyStrudel,Excellent communications book. Very clear and simple to understand. 
780,Marius Colacioiu,"Recommended read, one of Dale Carnegie's classic."
781,Melody Riches,"There aren't a lot of books that I purchase and even less that I find myself reading more than once, but I have read this twice in one year and encourage many others to read it."
782,Jessica Aquila,A great book on how to deal with people in the business world as well as with friends. 
783,Sabrina Lin,"I really like this book! It's an really helpful book because it teaches me how to be positive and have a better relationship with other people. In the story, Dale Carnegie, the author, told about his life experiences. For example, he once faced a big problems, but instead of feeling depressed, he tried to think positively, and the problem was solved shortly after. This book really helps me on how to face problems and solve them easily without any troubles."
784,Gideon Ballou,"This book is a must read for anyone who works with people. It gives great insight into the minds of people and how they want you to treat them. This book can truly transform your relationships. Many similar books have been written, but few compare. "
785,Justin Ton,Currently in the early chapters. Must take notes on this info and try to read it slowly.
786,joshjs,"Most of the points herein are pretty obvious, but they're also easy things to forget."
787,Nandasiri Wanninayaka,"How to Win Friends and Influence People was written by Dale Carnegie and published in 1936. By now 15 million copies of the book have been sold worldwide. This is said to be the first self-help book ever published.I listened to the audio book only a few days ago. What an excellent book it is. This should have reached me a couple of years ago before I took some unwise decisions in both my personal and professional life. The book tells you how to win friends and retain them by not hurting them yet getting your things done. I have not been as smart as Carnegie in those areas. I have made a lot of friends and lost some of the best of them due to my impatience. I should have dealt with them in a more diplomatic way. But there was no Carnegie book with me those days.I don’t think I am late. It is never too late. I can start NOW. I am 41 now. I can win my friends back. I can win what I lost now, well except one thing. You can guess what.I used to criticize people in public and even through media for their faults with the hope that they would correct themselves. But I don’t think anybody was corrected by my criticisms. Instead they became hostile with me and attacked me fiercely whenever and wherever they could. It cost me dearly. I should have been shrewd with them. Criticizing doesn’t bring good results at all. It only hurts people and make them your enemies. You can attract people by admiring them rather than criticizing. That is what I am going to do from now on. I would have to do it sincerely without flattering them though.I had been bad in letter writing too. I have written many emails that hurt people. Those who receive them retaliated. Only few who were educated enough understood my sentiments and took things logically. But many started scathing attacks on me. One has to be very careful in this age of Internet. You should not just hit the send button before reading the email you wrote once more. If the email is on a critical issue, keep it in the draft box at least for another day before sending. Carnegie gives you good examples of how to write good letters in the book.The book teaches you how to win people and increase one’s influence, prestige and one’s ability to get the things done. In fact his ways are very simple when you read. You feel that you complicate simple things by being hasty or impatient. And you make a mess ultimately.The book also teaches you how to sell yourself. You can become a better salesman or executive if you follow Carnegie’s advice. He will tell you how to win new clients and customers in creative ways.The book helps you to handle complaints, avoid arguments, keep your human contacts smooth and pleasant. It will also help make you a better speaker and a more entertaining conversationalist.As a whole, after reading the book, you will become a totally changed individual who can take life positively. You will also be a more productive person who can take intelligent decisions in both your personal and professional life.It is said that the billionaire businessman Warren Buffett took the Dale Carnegie course “How to Win Friends and Influence People” when he was 20 years old and to this day has the diploma in his office."
788,Matt Busche,This is a book I will probably re-read yearly because it was so great. So many great tips for being a better person and getting along with others. Everyone should read this book.
789,Janene,so practical! will definitely read and reference again and again...
790,Michael Carlson,"Dear Dad, 45 years ago you so wanted me to read this book that you offered to pay me $10 if I did it. Well, Dad, I finally did! And I now see why you thought so highly of this book and how it shaped you so profoundly (and then, how you shaped me so profoundly!). I thought it was going to be trivial and trite; just a bunch of ""positive thinking"" type stuff. Instead, I found it full of real wisdom and insight.And every page reminded me of you!Love,Mike"
791,carlos benjamin,A timeless classic. It sometimes catches me by surprise when I hear someone attributing their success in part to this book among a couple of other classics. It shouldn't though. Times may change. Fads may come and go. Each generation may seem more cynical than the last. Human nature pretty much stays the same.
792,Nichole,"Absolutely Fantastic!!! Nothing I say will do it justice, it has to be read! "
793,K.E. Patton,"This book gives you the keys to human relations, social skills, and sometimes just common courtesy. I recommend this book be read by ANYONE who works with people - sales, retail, CEO's, and guys just starting out at the bottom rung - this will change your life. "
794,Tejas,A nice book! Very good lessons about human nature. It gives basics for behavior. 
795,Yang Ming Wen ,"With 1965 reviews before mine, I don‘t think I am able to pay this book any compliment that hasn’t been paid by someone else; but like many other best-selling inspirational books, “How to Win Friends & Influence People” got, from many of its readers, little more than “pure inspiration”. How many, after reading and praising this book, would be able to claim really applying the rules presented in the book as guidance of their everyday interaction with the others? Not too many, I‘m afraid; otherwise the effect should be easily felt. The inconvenient fact is: people are egoistic and self-centered, and often fail to realize that others are as egoistic and self-centered as themselves. To recognize the existence of such traits as part of human nature is to acknowledge their existence in one’s self. So, to insist on applying the rules set out in the book, while not having too high expectation on being reciprocated, requires a strong sense of purpose and some serious will power. "
796,Abdulwahid,This book is literally the best book in human relations of all timeThis book is priceless It is very affective Its instructions are very powerful that it works instantly This book really makes you win friends and influence people with honesty and Sincerity....REST IN PEACE MR DALE
797,Vivek Rajan Vivek,"With over 15 million copies sold, this book will continue to sell for all time to come.In a nutshell ""Do unto others that you would have them do to you"" is the underlying theme of the book.Very well written, it is a book that must be revisited at least once a year.A must read and a must on everyone's book shelf.Vivek Rajan Vivek A Great Sage and A Rascal Named Dokuwww.vivekrajanvivek.com"
798,Jo Morgan,Fabulous.....I took notes in my journal and refer to them often!!
799,Doug Rice,"This a classic in the study of communication. What is now considered common sense, Carnegie lays out in rules and applications. Very good advice about communicating with people in an honest and productive manner. Gets a little repetitive in the second half, but is all in all an engaging read."
800,Jeremy,I learned these principles when I was young. Everyone should commit them to their heart. 
801,Nabil,كتاب قيم لكاتب رفيع المستوى .. كارنجي استطاع أن يقدم نموذج للإنسان الذي يتحرك بإيجابية وبحكمة في جميع مواقف الحياة..من المؤسف أن نرى غير المسلمين يسبقونا لاسعاد البشرية عن طريق المناهج السوية في العيش ...ونحن أصحاب الوحي.
802,Paul (Skip),Timeless!
803,Jason Poling,"Allthough I can't agree with every part of the psychology, this is a very worthy read. Many of the principles are right in line with loving your neighbor and becoming a servant to others. I loved all the anecdotes as well."
804,Riley,"Timeless. Well, perhaps times are a little more complicated now but the basic principles remain the same"
805,Meredith Worley,"Couldn't be a better book. Applicable for any job and multiple relationship, both business and personal."
806,Karoline,"So good! In my opinion, one of the best books ever written! Timeless classic.."
807,Laurel Karnes,"Sections/paragraphs are outdated, but overall this book is full of common sense, yet oftentimes forgotten, keys to successful social interactions. I have a growing list of people for whom, I think, this book would be VERY helpful..."
808,Charlotte,"CLASSIC!!! I try to read this every year to remind myself of the ""Social Rules."""
809,Samuel Savuica,"Understanding that people skills are indispensable to a good life is one of my first ""aha"" moments. Everything you do involves people."
810,Melanie,"This is one book I can read every couple of years. This was written 75 years ago, but is still relevant today. Definitely a staple on my bookshelf. "
811,Lukas Dufka,"The most life-transforming book I've ever read! In my opinion, everyone should at least read it, if not study it and live by it. World would be a greater place and life easier to live if only that was true. Even if you hate books and can't bring yourself to reading one, I'd still recommmend you reading this one; I'd force you to if I could:)"
812,Beth,Great classic self-help book!
813,Laurel L. Perez,"This title is misleading, the age of this book is misleading. Sure it was written in the 30s, sure, it sound cheesy. Let me tell you, I don't usually read books like this, and I wasn't sure what I had gotten myself into. That being said, I think everyone needs to read this book, the principals in this book are so important to just being a kind, and considerate human being. If you happen to work with people, which seems like something we cannot escape in our world, or you are a manager, instructor, or overseer - READ THIS BOOK. Honestly, I think this book could be titled, ""How to Get What You Want & How to Not Be an Asshole""."
814,RC Langilll,"I've read this book through several times over, but I carry it with me on my daily commute so that I can go back and read another chapter if it's been a while.This book has been out there for some time, but its advice still applies today. This is my best example of how his advice helped:I was arguing with a bank branch manager who was telling me that the check I was depositing was going to be subject to special holds. At the time, not being able to use the money wasn't critical, but it was inconvenient, and damned annoying since I knew there wasn't any problem with the check. I had raised a points regarding the source of funding, rules on clearing, and level of customer service I was receiving. The manager responded with several points, including, how this was for my protection. My annoyance was heading into anger when I remembered Dale Carnegie's advice to avoid getting into an argument. Once you're in a argument, he said, you're not going to win, no matter how effectively you press your point. I hadn't avoided the argument, but I could still keep from making things worse. I took the check back, and then stopped at the branch that was close to my home (the first branch was close to where I work). There, the branch manager politely asked about the nature of this check. I told him, and things proceeded normally.This book provides Dale Carnegie's advice and techniques for interacting with people, but, even more than that, it invites you to adopt an outlook and understanding that people do things based on their beliefs of their valid needs. If you respect that when you're dealing people, you're much more likely to have a better, agreeable outcome. "
815,Theigbobandit,Written in clear and simple language... difficult to apply as i find myself constantly reverting to criticism etc. Need to summarise and put same on my desktop wallpaper
816,Phil,"Pretty old book with a lame title, but surprisingly relevant and helpful. I can see why it's considered a classic and is still read today. Pretty much everyone can benefit from the things that are in here. (The section about home life is more than a little outdated, but considering it was published in 1936, it's understandable.) I'd say read this book. Do it."
817,Lee Sacco,This book should be 6th grade mandatory reading. The name really does not fit. If you never took the time to read it please do. This is really an excellent life lesson book. easily one of my favorites
818,Gaurang Garg,"I learned an incredible amount from this book. Ideas are great when they seem simple yet profound, and each one of his suggestions are both. "
819,Brayan Lopez,"Very specific giving examples, its an amazing book to read:)"
820,Vincent,"The book itself is interesting in that it was published in the 1940s but still provides relevant advice for working with people. Despite technological advancements, the human ego remains unchanged. I am particularly drawn to the stories he tells to bring his point across. It worked much better for me than similar books where you are simply told ""this is the way you need to do it."" "
821,Richard Stephenson,"Beautiful - the title almost kept me from reading it (as I thought it sounded a bit manipulative) but this book is SO much more than that. I'll come back and add more, but this is a life changer."
822,Salliwarner65,It's amazing how simple this book is and how much sense it makes. Why is it that every time I read it I realize that I have forgotten to do everything it says?
823,Kenneth,"A timeless classic on how to get along with people on a daily basis. Much of the information is probably already evident to a well-mannered ethical person with some experience working with people. It should be especially useful to younger adults, as I don't think this wisdom is taught quite as much as it used to be."
824,Lori Kelly,I've read this book several times. It's brilliant. 
825,Marshall,"I have read this book cover to cover 3 times. The first time my dad paid me $20.00 and all I wanted to do was finish it as fast as I could. However, the 2nd and 3rd time I read it, I attacked it at a complete different approach. I wanted to actually learn and change and better myself cause of it. It is an excellent read and should be read slowly. Dale tells many great stories. I learned a lot of traits and characteristics from this book that has helped me along in life. I put it on my list of Top 10 of All-Time."
826,Michał,"Most important book ever! (after Bible) Should be must-read for all adults or even kids. Don't get fulled by the title. It's about how to be better, live better, pay more attention to other people, about healthy relations in business and personal life. You probably haven't read Bible, Tora or whatever-your-religion-is Book so... this one is like essence/summary of healthy human relations - might seem to get helpful for You ;)"
827,Lauren,One of those books everyone should read at least once. Highly recommended to all young professionals
828,Sueanne, I just love this book. I have read it 4x. I always come away with wanting a better memory and recall about facts and meeting people. Slowly I am applying the tools it taches to do so.
829,Vladimir Tsebenko,Рус. вариант.Читается очень легко. Главная идея - будь проще и люди к тебе потянутся)
830,Kecia,This is one of the most important books I've ever read. There is nothing new in this book really. It's just that Carnegie frames the importance of being kind in such a way that the reader feels like they can change the world with only a smile. I checked this one out from the library but I wanted to underline and highlight and make margin notes...so I had to buy a copy from Amazon today. It's that good.
831,Edwin,Read it at least 3 times in my life. A must read for everyone.
832,Amber Fuller,"I read this book as a young teen and absorbed some of the lessons that Carnegie shares on how to interact effectively with people. Classic. Still worthy of its reputation as one of the best ""people skills"" books ever written. "
833,Brianne,If you're socially awkward...read this book!
834,Anton Klink,"This was the first self-help book I ever read (I may have been around 12 at the time) and it changed my world. I even wrote out suggestions on cue cards and carried them with me at school and pretty much everywhere. I must say the relationships in my life started to improve markedly once I started applying the suggestions given by Carnegie and it also gave me my first impulse to become more interested in psychology and development - an interest, which has persisted to this day. Although I admit a 12 year old mind can be easily impressed, I still consider this one of the most life-changing books I've ever read and a true classic."
835,TrustNo1,"I try to read a chapter of this book every day (usually week days). It is hit or miss, but I have read this book at least a dozen times now. I will likely read it many more times. I do this basically just to remind myself of the lessons in the book. Of course, some lessons are more useful than others and I just gloss over the examples he uses as I have read them so many times before. "
836,Jazz,must read book ... deep and basic insights in human interactions .... I chaned after reading this book
837,Brentley Campbell,A guide on how to be a really nice person
838,Julie Baylor,"Even if you've read this before, do so again. It keeps you inspired, motivated and on the right track with people. "
839,Shane Vitriol,"Required reading if you deal with people, like work with people, have a significant other, in a band, have friends, etc. Basically, everyone. Wish I read it 15 years ago. It's up there or even higher than Stephen Covey's 7 Habits. Worth a re-read every few years. I learned much of what's in this book the hard way, but somethings are worth reiterating. 1. Acknowledge everyone. 2. If you think you've won an argument, you've actually lost. "
840,Rahul Sharma,Pefect book for people skill. You can't succeed with people without reading this book
841,Drahmed Tarek,Sufficient instructions and basics which change each of personality ..
842,Carol,A timeless self help book...the tips in this book hold true today as they did back then!
843,Stuart Creamer,Incredible read if you want to grow as a leader. Timeless tips for growth.
844,Darla Wiltse,"I have heard of this book for decads, but finally read it and was very pleasantly surprised. Dale Carnegie had a very conversational style of writing that makes for an easy read. When reading the book, the lessons taught are simple, clear and obvious, but presented in such a way as to give them a fresh insight and application. I'll be reading this book many times."
845,Chetan Madaan,Awesome Piece. Changed my life to a certain extent.
846,Ianthe Hernandez,"This is an awesome book that everyone needs to read. It will make communication a lot easier with friends, family, employees, managers and all else. This is not only a book you need to read. It is a book you need to study. Every chapter is an ""aha"" moment. I am letting my children read this book because I truly believe that it will help them in many aspects of their lives."
847,Mindaugas Vilius,Book about work with yourself.
848,Soul,"Absolutely amazing book on people relations and how to improve them one at a time. The title of it have kept me at bay from reading it any earlier(I mean who want's to influence anyone... right) But I was so Wrong... Now I wish I had read it in my teen age or earlier still.. I would go on to say that, this is The only book you need for becoming a better person.(period)Enjoyed it thoroughly, completed it in 3 sessions.. so you can guess how engrossing it must have been. :D Please if time permits read it once, for I am sure you will like it; if not then just pass it along..This one cost me almost nothing but has value like anything...definitely a reread every 6 months or so.. ;)"
849,Abdul Qayum Aria,The things that i have read of this book is similar to the other author's books it is hopeful and a good book it does interested me alot with few interesting pointsIt is quite interesting book...Sincerly yoursAbdul Qayum Aria
850,Makeida Ezekiel,"Good book. Book summaryTo win friends and influence people one must be like a dog. Not in the negative sense, but dog is mans best friend for a reason.... Give without expectation, always be happy to see people on a good or bad day. Never ask for too much, comfort others, serve, give and love without limit. There, that is the book in a nutshell"
851,Victoria Lea,This book just gives us an alternative to treating people in work relationships in a negative way. I've found that it's helped me deal with others so much better. 
852,Peter ,"Got it on an audiobook, Recommend to listen to his stories daily. "
853,Ruebs N,This book is absolutely amazing!! If everyone read this book the world would be a better place!! Highly recommended!! :) 
854,Harshavardhan Kadiyala,great book with simple truth about human relationships
855,Byuboston,I absolutely love this book. It is definitely one of my all-time favorites.
856,Nic Pluto,"Definitely a must read in order to enhance the quality of your life. As of this moment, this has been the most humbling book for me to date. I recommend to start applying these concepts asap!!"
857,Brett Anderson,This book has immensely practical advice on the matters of interpersonal communication.
858,Suzan Oktaria,mari mencari kawan sebanyak-banyaknya
859,Kent Taylor,"fabulous book, worth reading every few years"
860,Daniel,This was one of the best books that I have ever read.It works!
861,Jim Traylor,Good 
862,Molnár Tamás,"When I started reading I thought, come on... Reading a book from 1936 in the 21st century about influencing? But after reading, I was amazed how good ""rules"" are in the book and they still timely! This is a must read for everyone and the world would be a better and more peaceful place if these rules would be known and be kept."
863,Nicholas XP,"I am at a loss of words. I seldom feel ineffable, but this book has struck the right cord. Nothing could wholly elicit the magnitude of this book's truth. However, I will try to enact my mind's sentiments in the best way possible and to be the bearer of unvarnished truths that this book promotes. I have read many books over the course of the year and none have measured up to the quality of this insightful and completely viable book. The reason I never got around to reading it until now is because I thought I understood human nature; the intricacies that beleaguer us, where our thoughts come from, to how to influence - I ignorantly thought this was an innate power and could not be taught. In turn, I am now flabbergasted I wasted precious time and put off reading this quintessential book until this date. I will not go into detail about everything because I have already kept detailed notes in a file on my computer. However, I will extol the perpetual, and ubiquitous veracities this book so handsomely presents. Dale Carnegie was nothing at his conception until his late teens. He thought about suicide after feeling at loss with himself, but he wanted to make a name for himself; he wanted to fulfill a purpose. He knew athletics and the public speaking at his college were prominent, and knowing he had no athletic abilities he turned his energy to the latter. He studied day and night and lost a myriad competitions, but one day, he prevailed. And as they say, it is history from there. Reading his backstory, along with the many rag-to-riches stories in this book always fills me with an ambience of eminent power. One day I will be one of them. Furthermore, while reading, everything seems as if it was a truism, yet it needed to be said for me to wholly understand the ways of the human experience. As Carnegie profusely stated, the only way to get the best of this book is to practice. We are creatures of habit and habitual creatures are in need of constant and continuous reinforcement. We must break the bad qualities and ingrain in ourselves the more noble. In addition to the content, the anecdotes and quotes are exceptionally canny. I am a person who puts a lot of thought into what quotes to keep in my common place book, and this book has showed itself to be profound that I extracted the most quotes than any other.This book is meant for everyone. This book has no cordons, real or imagined; it is translated into almost every language, and the cultural barrier argument is dismal and faint. We are all humans and are all in need to peruse this sage advice. Knowledge is not enough. We must have the people skills, of which I must work hard on for it is my weakest link, to empower others and to fulfill our dreams. "
864,Bianca Casetta,"This was amazing. Sometimes people can be so easy to read it hurts. The overall idea is that you have to be kind to people if you want them to do something, and therefore that will make them want to do it. Not shouting, not giving orders, not imposing yourself, because that makes them feel inferior and hurts their pride, and thus not do whatever you wanted them to do. Also, be interested in them. Fake flattering won't get you anywhere. Listen to what they have to say and you'll be surprised.All in all, a great book."
865,Zach,"Excellent book filled with practical advice; Carnegie's enthusiasm is contagious and radiates off each printed page. Changed the way I interact with people on an everyday basis. The techniques Carnegie discusses are fantastic, they work like magic."
866,Thomas Zeman,Very valuable for written communication especially.
867,K.A.M. Boham,"I picked this up because my book club is reading it. I don't know if I ever would have otherwise and that would have been unfortunate. There is so much information in this book. I bought it so I can reference it again and again. And, it is life-changing. I started applying some of the principles in this book at my job and saw an instant difference, especially in how I felt at the end of the day. Well worth it. I recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their relationships with other people."
868,Mikhaila Christian,"Wow!! I remember reading this years ago after hearing about it over and over again and seeing it in the offices of many local leaders (even my bank teller had it on display!) As I was just looking through my collection of books in my library I realized that I was so empowered by this book and it's something you should truly read monthly, as recommended in the book itself. As mentioned on theguardian.com ""Carnegie taught very simple rules of interaction, such as try to use someone's name when talking to them or first meeting them. Listen to what they have to say and let other people do a lot of the talking when discussing your ideas. Be enthusiastic and never let an opportunity to make a new friend pass by as you never know when you might need them.""That's the gist of this book and it's such common sense you almost feel like you already knew it all along but needed some guidance to refresh your memory. This is your refresher ! "
869,Jaybelz,This book should be required reading begining at age 12 and must be re-read every 5 years for life.
870,Uday Batra,"it has been of great help and has changed my way of thinking in how to deal with people . the principles in the book are genuine , universal truths that we overlook in our daily lives . thoroughly enjoyable with so many short anecdotes that the book is definitely 'unputdownable' . 5/5 and two thumbs up"
871,Mark,A classic I wish I read a long time ago. If more people took this stuff to heart the world would probably be a better place. And if politicians and foreign policy advisors adopted / adapted these approaches the world would definitely be a better place.
872,Meshaal Alshehri,This book is like the Mona Lisa of self development . It's faccinating .
873,Arnav Shah,"This is among the most useful books I've read. Dale Carnegie offers his insights in dealing with other people in the most human ways and allowing for a mutual benefit in turn. As Carnegie [disappointingly] points out on several occasions, this is the sort of stuff they should us in school (and even since 1936, our education system lacks this important knowledge). Carnegie writes well and much of the book is filled with actual stories of his principles put into practice. I highly recommend this read to everyone, and especially so to geeks, as they'd benefit greatly from the skills presented in this book."
874,Budoor Al-Yousuf,"the book was really good in the sense that you can immediately start implementing the things the author mentions. It is very realistic and down to earth, not too confusing or too difficult to try and do. I also loved how the examples were of normal people and the author went the extra mile to give more than one example on each item to insure you understand the different approaches.I started using the suggestions almost as and when I heard them because they left a quick effect and are fairly easy to do as long you remember to do them.for anyone who works with clients/customers or is in Marketing/Communications or even if you want to develop your people skill, this is a brilliant book !"
875,Phillip,This book was better than I remembered it being from the time I read it decades ago.
876,Pratikblackunicorn,Great book which helps me to improve my communication skill .
877,Chris Thomas,"I've resisted reading this because it sounded manipulative, fake. Having read the book now, I think we'd enjoy a far better society if we all followed these rules. Highly recommended read."
878,Brandon Keller,I love Dale Carnegie books and i'm a sucker for self improvement books because they always make me feel like i can do anything. Plus... i've won many a friend and influenced hoards of people due to this book. Just sayin.
879,Binazehra,The reading of this book helped me to know how to tackle situations and be intrested amoung people.
880,Shari,I have read this book several times. It is one that is based on basic principles that we often forget. Highly recommend it be read by anyone who interact with others - so yes that would be everyone!
881,Olya Shahinyan,Excellent ideas!
882,طريف,أظن بان هذا الكتاب هو أول كتاب قرائته من الحاسوب، ديل كارنيجي ترك فيّ أثرًا طيبًا وحسّن من طرقة تعاملي مع اﻵخرين .. لا يمكنني أن أتجاهل هذا الكتاب عندما يطلب مني كتاب جيد عن التعامل مع اﻵخرين .. وأتمنى أن اعود فأقراه يوماجمعت جميع قواعد ونصائح الكتاب بملخص شامل هناhttp://tinyurl.com/cz8aztyولم يبق من الكتاب إلا القصص والأمثلة الكثيرة حول هذه القواعد
883,Shara,Excellent! One of my favorite books that I read over and over.
884,Bobbi Castrovinci,reading for the third time.. a must! 
885,Troy,This is a MUST read. This timeless classic will help anyone in all areas of life.
886,ron newman,This book takes information and interviews form thousands of successful people and compiles it into a format that makes tremendous commen sense. The narrative is plain spoken and folksy. Truely a timeless self help book. 
887,Bev Dowdell,There are many milestone comments in this book which changed my thinking. Changing my thinking changed my world both inside and how I related to people around me. It wasn't easy to set aside past behaviours and attitudes I had learned but it was worth digging it up and throwing it away and starting afresh. That God didn't judge people until the end of their days so what right did I have to criticise made me cry my eyes out for an hour and then the real work of change began! The blessing from that cannot be quantifiable.
888,Tania Victory,This book MUST to read. 
889,Aaron Yoder,This is one of those books to study and reread and reread. Tons of wisdom! ;-)
890,Lauren Hawkins,This was the most influential self-help book I've read and it always kept me interested with the anecdotes!
891,Dahl Kids,"My two oldest (ages 11 and 10) read this. I never have, and they've been calling me on not acting by its ideals. Time to pick it up!"
892,Shahid Hussain Raja,"Carnegie’s book –How to Win Friends and Influence People should be read in one’s teens as I did and have been a great admirer of Carnegie since then. It has played a very significant role in my personal development, teaching me two very important lessons-how to empathize with others and secondly, keeping the business relationships and personal relationship absolutely inseparable."
893,Jefferson F,"Every time I read this book (I have read it between 20-30 times) I find that I tend to treat people a little better every time. I have it both in audio and in written, I strongly recommend it."
894,Naveen Sharma,Masterpiece! i don't have words to explain but i think i should've read this years ago!! 
895,Gerald,"classic, everyone should know and practice these basic principles of human interaction"
896,Ritesh Bhagwati,"So, I finally ended reading this book. For me this book was one of a kind. I read about one article on warren buffet in local business newspaper one day. In which he mentioned how this book has been a great influence on him and how he lauded the author’s work. Then that’s it, I made up a mind to grab this book and make sure I too read this book, and here I did. This is very few of my non fiction reads till now. Let me put it this way, I may not be a perfect reviewer of this book (because of my negligible knowledge of reviewing or at least particular in non fiction area) but I can least say how satisfied I was after reading this book. Nevertheless, it’s added to one of my favorites for my life. As it is mentioned in the book by author, this book is not supposed to be read like a novel, but more of like a life help book which you can refer to or re read it as many times as you can and try to imbibe the principles stated in the book.This is what I’m planning to do, to re read it very soon again. It’s a must haves for all the novice/pro readers, as I think this book would help you in some way or the other. I don’t think its any genre specific or anything rather its more of general human specific. Which is why I think this book needs this very attention. I shall not speak much about this book, I think it’s a quite a quick read and definitely worth a time. Go and grab this book when you can, its definitely a worth the money at which it sells.Am actually looking forward to read more books by this author. "
897,Paddi,Everything valuable in Psychology is in this book for making your life better. The ideas are also in the Bible. 
898,Olga Barasoain,The very first book I read with my Mom....I was 7 how lucky was I to have such a progressive thinkers as she.
899,Eric Raabe,"This book teaches you fundamental techniques in dealing with people, how to make people like you, how to win people to your way of thinking, and how to be a leader. I enjoyed reading this book very much and thought it was very well written. It consists of several short stories which makes it easy to read without getting bored. I liked how Dale Carnegie utilized his broad spectrum of knowledge in history to thoroughly explain skills he's obtained over his lifetime to truly be a better person. My favorite thing about this book is how you can read it in any order you want, unlike an ordinary book. I don't usually enjoy reading but I was able to easily give this book a five star rating. "
900,Joe Tee,"A self help worth readingWho am I to review this old yet still new book, a classic easy to read book full with gems of wisdom that never goes out of style."
901,Chathura ,this is a very useful book though its a bit old the applications available for the methods given will be out there until human communication remains. 
902,Melissa T,"One usually hears the title of this book in conjunction with a joke about someone...but it shouldn't be a joke! Not only is it a book everyone should read, I think everyone should read it once a year as a review. "
903,Meg,"I loved this book. Great advice for anyone. Some people probably see this advice as all ""duh"", and while it is common sense, it is presented in such a logical manner that it still feels like you're learning. I think this is the best management book I've read. Plus- the writing and examples are so adorably old-timey!"
904,Andrew Clouser,I've thought more about listening since reading this book. 
905,Fatima  Alghamdi,أول كتاب قرأته تقريباكان له أثر رائع في نفسي .. تعلمت منه أدوات بسيطة ولكنها فعالة و مؤثرة في كسب من حولي
906,Weiwei Zhu,"It's a very useful book. Simple principles. It's easy to read but not so easy to apply those principles to everyday life. Practice is very important to make the best use of the book. Because it was written quite a while ago, certain rules in the book are kind of outdated. "
907,Rob Myklebust,"I loved this book. Easy to read, with great anecdotal stories to support each chapter's principle. A must read for anyone in a sales and marketing position."
908,Dasha,"I listened to an abridged/summarized version of this book based on a recommendation, and found it very insightful and helpful. I probably wouldn't follow every advice in it in that exact way, but it is definitely worthwhile to check out. While a lot of the ideas weren't new to me, I found that it is written with great examples and anecdotes to make the concepts more demonstrative and relatable, as well as interesting. I am going to get the full copy in the future, as well as read Carnegie's other books, and do recommend this one to others. "
909,Marilyn,"What an AWESOME book!!!! I loved it! It makes so much sense! He teaches the reader so many ways to be a more thoughtful, caring, humble, sincere, selfless and an all around GOOD person! If everyone read this book we'd all change the world for the better. :D"
910,Michael Cunningham,"If you never read Dale Carnegie's best selling book `How To Win Friends and Influence People (1938)', then it's likely you haven't got many friends, and have a laughable amount of influence over people.The author, Dale Carnegie used to give lectures on how to become a more likeable boss in the workplace, and increase staff productivity as a result. It was when he realised that these tactics were extremely effective at getting anybody to like you, that he decided to write the book. It was first published in 1936 and has since sold over 15,000,000 copies worldwide, it is also widely considered to be the world's first self-help book.How to Win Friends and Influence People might be a funny name for a book, but it is undoubtedly the tome for helping one develop better relationships with anyone, whether it be at work, on the bus, or at home. Highly recommended. "
911,Teodor Ciuraru,"In my opinion, this books presents the most important principles mankind can learn. It doesn't only help you in entrepreneurship or sales, it is this high level way of living that we all must accept as mandatory. This book (also applying its rules), is all that it takes to make the world a better place. My sincere appreciation."
912,Zaini Mokhtar,This goes on the greatest book in my list as 'Intelligent Investor' does.
913,Venkataraman Kumbakonam S.,This book is simply a masterpiece. Its usefulness extends not only to those who have to move with a number of persons on a daily basis; but also to individuals mostly left to themselves. This is so because the author prepares the reader to be a good human being at peace with himself or herself. 
914,José Sosa,This book changed my life for the better!
915,Karthikeya Sharma,"This is a gem of a book. Whenever an author tries to blindly advocate some philosophy as a universal truth, especially in personality development books, I tend to repel from it and apparently can't trust his doctrine. This is one guy who probably did more research than any other human being for writing a book with this theme. He also demonstrates it. He himself mentioned to use this book as a dictionary which should be revisited several times. After reading once, I agree that the book stands upto this statement."
916,Dre,"Even though the book was dated, the information was timeless. Easy to implement in daily living!"
917,Stacey,Such a great and entertaining read. Plus it should be a required read in school since some people are so socially handicapped and dumb.
918,Ernie Dean,This book is a must read for anyone wanting to do better in any business or personal endeavor. 
919,محمد الذهبي,كتاب رائع يمكننا أن نجد لكل قاعدة من قواعده شواهد من القرآن الكريم والسنة النبوية الشريفة .. والقسم الأخير فيه هو الأروع بالفعل .. رغم أن النسخة المترجمة التي حصلت عليها ليست جيدة على النحو الذي يجعلني أثني عليها كثيراً .. أشجع الآخرين على قراءته أو على الأقل قراءة الفصل الأخير الذي يتضمن بعض القواعد للمحافظة على الحياة الزوجية الناجحة ..
920,Farras Wibisono,"The main idea of this book: ""Don't resist the nature of human"". You can call it normative, you can call it old and dull, you can call it ""common sense, everybody already know it"" type of book, but admit it: Carnegie tells the truth. Many people never aware the importance of traits that this book taught you to do, and Carnegie explains it with a straightforward examples that will make you feel guilty about yourself. Why this old book still relevant today? Because human's nature is never changed. Definitely a timeless masterpiece."
921,Dayla,"I took a course one Saturday just on this book. I was 19 at the time, and I have never, ever regretted having this information under my belt.If you are shy about talking socially, this book has all the answers. I still remember the order:housefamilychimneyplaneJust those four will be enough conversation for at least an hour. "
922,Tim Harper,"As one with a more scientific mind, this book helped me to better interact with people. I've read it several times, and it has changed the way I interact with others for the better.Some highlights:* Those who have technical skill, plus the ability to *EXPRESS IDEAS* & *AROUSE ENTHUSIASM IN OTHERS*, are those who are headed for higher earning power (not those who can simply outperform everyone on a technical level).• When presenting an alternative point of view, lessen the pride-wall by admitting ""I could be wrong""; If you admit you could be wrong, they're likely to as well• Avoid correcting people in public, especially over trivial things. You may be right, but it could cause you to lose a friend.• Speak to other's interests. When trying to sell them on something, remember that people don't really much care about your interests at all; How is what you are selling going to benefit them?* Never forget the futility of criticism: never say anything critical of anyone, at anytime. The person in whom your confiding when blaming others is also a ""one"" - why wouldn't you do the same behind their back? It destroys trust."
923,Yvette,Stands the test of time. Still completely relevant!
924,Christina Ledesma,"Great, practical advice on how to talk to people that you interact with daily while making lasting impressions on their perspective of you. I learned a lot from this book and believe that if you try to apply the principles to your life, you will be very successful in all your relationships. Great communication tips. "
925,Abu Yillah,It helps... That's all I can tell you! IT REALLY DOES HELP :)
926,Ian Cassel,"Written in 1936, this book ranks up there with Think And Grow Rich as one of the best books of all time. "
927,Julianna,A MUST read!!
928,Jared Pangier,"77 years later...and still great!If you love self-improvement, love people, and want to figure out how to get along in the world, then read this book."
929,Akash Aggarwal,"incredible book and what more incredible is ""the forgotten basic"".Mr. Carnegie will not told you to change them but he clearly mentioned the fact that what we need to change in ourselves to see the change in themselves.I have not even a slightest doubt that if I can follow these principles even a bit of them the story will be different.but here comes the most challenging task....to religiously follow them.Awesome read"
930,Philip Johnsey,A great reminder on the power of personal leadership. 
931,Matt Millett,"Great read! Very good and simple advice! Told with interesting stories that keep the book moving along. If you only have a little time, each chapter could probably be read independent of the rest of the book. I think I may actually start reading one chapter at a time here and there to give a little food for thought for the day."
932,Robert Laffoday,"I read this three times before graduating high school in 1991. I make it a practice to read it again, once a year and on a couple occasions, even twice in a given year! One of the best (and most common-sense) books of all time!I think this should be REQUIRED reading at least by the Sophomore or Junior year of High School. Even if it was pushed back to the Senior year, it should by ALL means, be a part of graduation requirements!"
933,Philip Faustin,Some people may think this is a book about kissing up to people and playing games of manipulation to get what is desired out of people. This couldn't be farther from the truth. This is a book about human nature. It teaches you to communicate in a way that will give people what they want out of interactions with you and in turn you will get what you desire out of them. Everyone should read this book. 
934,Sangeetaa Menon,I read this nearly 15 years ago and it helped me turn from shy introvert to an extrovert. I'm still using some of the tips I learnt back in those days.
935,Kadie Bennion,Good interpersonal relations book!
936,Ryan Ellis,This book is an essential read. Everybody should follow these simple steps and watch their world transform! Amazing book that stands the test of time.
937,missk,"Amazing book, read the English version:) I keep reading it over and over again"
938,Jamie,This book should be required reading for every human being! The world would be a different place :)
939,Brett Spiva,Great book for any business leader! I've read it twice and parts of it three times. We should really ask ourselves why books like these do not make their way into our schools. 
940,Joseph Bakshandeh,A must read on human relations. One of the most influential books in my life. Taught me how to properly deal with people in life. In a good way.
941,Floris Wolswijk,"How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie is a classic. That is all there needs to be said. It is a book that you can read, make notes in, and pick up every year. It has had a powerful influence on the way we think about other people, and ourselves. It was way ahead of its time in 1953, and is still topical more than a half century later. A must read for anyone interested in making new friends, acquiring new clients and customers, improve your conversation skills, and to win people over to your way of thinking. Brilliant in simplicity, it is the groundwork for self-improvement.The book begins like no other. Carnegie encourages readers to make notes, to jot down in the book and read every chapter at least twice. By actively engaging in a book, you will be most involved, and will remember more. Even before the book engages you to think about personal interactions, you have learned a valuable lesson applicable in all your further reads. The learning continues with chapters on topics like 1) How to interest people, 2) How to get cooperation, and 3) No one likes to take orders. One of the basic techniques featured in the book is to put yourself in someone else’s shoes. This is in total alignment with the fifth principle of leadership by Stephen R. Covey: Seek First to Understand, Then to be Understood.‘You can’t win an argument’ is the clever title of the first chapter in the section about getting people to your way of thinking. After giving a lively example, Carnegie explains what is wrong with arguments. He states that nine out of ten times people will be more opposite to each other than before the argument commenced. Even when you win, it will be an empty victory, because you will not get the opponents good will. The chapter concludes with nine tips on how to prevent a disagreement from becoming an argument. In less than ten pages, a very important aspect of daily interaction has been explained, without jargon or unmanageable ways, but with simple language and clear examples and tips.Dale Carnegie grew up as a poor boy without any special skills. He learned all the skills written in the book along the way of life. He shows that you can change yourself over the years. He was a firm believer that only 15% of your (financial) success depends on your professional skills, and that 85% is based on interpersonal skills, described as: the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people. To date 16 million people have been influenced by the book. Among them is Warren Buffet, he followed the course related to the book, by Dale Carnegie himself, and to this day has the diploma in his office.How to Win Friends and Influence People is a straightforward, no-nonsense, go-and-do-it book. It has been a life changer for many people, including the author of this review. Although it does not give much advice about how to implement the techniques, not much is actually needed. Without a doubt the book deserves a 6 out of 6 rating."
942,Sabrina,the best book i've ever read. now it's a matter of practicing what i learned..good insight.
943,Chelsea DeVries,"This book, although this was the second time I read it, opened my eyes to such simple ways to be kinder and an overall pleasant person. Now I must start putting these tips into practice so I can make more friends."
944,Jameson Whiskey,I love this book! It's absolutely powerful and the principals are incredible when genuinely applied!
945,J,"Great book. It teaches and change my philosophy/way of thinking about communicating. Though, first time reading might have a hard time understanding (I read the revised edition). Try to digest it one chapter at a time and you'll get the hang of what he's telling you there"
946,Caellum,I think that everyone should read this at least once!
947,Aaron Williams,Excellent book - amazing that even so long after its initial publication it can still be so relevant to human nature. Lots to think about.
948,David Garza,"This is quite possibly one of the most important books ever written. Dale Carnegie's insights into dealing with people are timeless and effective. While some of the concepts seem too easy to work, when actually applied, they truly do win people to your way of thinking.I had a meeting recently with my boss, and walked away confused because he was very defensive the entire conversation. In our next meeting, instead of going to him with reasons that I was right, I decided to test out one of Carnegie's principles. I went into the meeting and gave him an honest complement on how his hard work and skills are very hard to match. If the organization had more men like him, it would be filled with heroes... so, how did he respond? We had one of the most pleasant and effective meetings that we had ever had.Thanks Dale Carnegie!"
949,Ridgewalker,"Don't let the fact that this book was first published in 1936 make you think that it is at all out of date or not applicable in todays brave new world. Getting along with people is one of those skills that no one teaches you, but every one of us would agree there is a wrong way, and a better way. I picked this up because I knew I was lacking in my ability to work with and influence others. I know someone who read this book while young and it was a life changing experience for them. To me, this person embodies many of the principles contained in this book. The book has been updated through the years but still retains the style and phrasing it did when first written. Many of the stories and examples from the original book are retained. This can make it come across as overly simplistic, and undocumented in todays world where the sum total of human knowledge is a click or two away. Speaking personally though, I quite fell in love with this book. It has the element of wisdom pasted down from the elder generation to the younger generation. I highly recommend it."
950,Vishnu,THE BOOK THAT CHANGED MY LIFE FOR EVER. SENT BY GOD
951,Fábio Rodrigues,Fácil entendimento e de ótimos resultados.
952,Phuc Apple,This book great for many pepople and special for young. 
953,Mrig,One of the best book you'll ever find on people..
954,Kyle Sawyer,"Everyone should read this book. It is quite possibly the best ""how-to"" on people interaction that I have read."
955,Edgars Labans,"Not all, but some advice could be successfully applied in real life in post-soviet country ;)"
956,Michael Brown,well worth reading and applying
957,Eddie,I cannot even begin to tell you how monumentally true and practical it's message is... This is a relationship book of biblical proportions. Which is why it was such a challenging read--taking me two courageous years to press through and finish. Everyone should read this book. Literally. The world would be a much better place.
958,Joanna,"Timeless, research based advice on how to be a classy, decent human being, in both your personal and business interactions. All based on the understanding that what you put out is what comes back at you. A lot of this is common sense, and a lot of it is what we already know (i.e., follow the Golden Rule) but it is a very well written, well organized, concise, invaluable compilation of these things and more. Great examples from history of these principles in action (via Lincoln, Roosevelt, Charles Schwab, etc.). Also some surprisingly good parenting advice! I think, unfortunately, some people misinterpret the advice in this book and think it is advocating manipulation and flattery. Carnegie is very clear that it is always imperative to be genuine. But it is beneficial to everyone to try to see things from other viewpoints, use tact, and look for and emphasize the positive when you can. "
959,Tom Dearden,"Finally read this classic. Why did it take me so long?! You simply must read this book. Some of the stories are a bit dated, but it doesn't make them any less appropriate. Get a paper copy and take notes. "
960,Sondos Shapsogh,This book should be taught in school. No joke! 
961,Alison,One of the best books I've ever read. 
962,Stacy Ramkhelawan,"Since I was about 15 years, I was advised to rad this book but never made any attempt to until I was 23 years. It was defintely worth it. I used to think, I have friends already I don't need anymore etc..Trust me..if that is your approach when considering whether to read this book or not, don't let that pre-conceived notion I had defer you from reading.Mr. Carnegie indicated ways of dealing with people..for eg, the simple task of smiling with someone you pass by, remembering someone's name. the latter principle i have strongly adopted because i take a lot of pride in my name. I like when people remembers my name.I read this book when I finished law school and began my working career. and it has helped!!!!! Strongly recommend it. would read it all over again. "
963,Seth Hutchison,really good advice
964,Justin Oliver,"Timeless instructions on being a charismatic and influential person, I recommend this book to everyone. "
965,Camille,Very good book about human relations - not much for entertainment but hopefully it will help me at work and home!
966,Krista Knigge,should be on everyone's reading list
967,Greg Poulton,"I read this book around the age of 14-15. Without exaggeration, it transformed the way I saw and interacted with the world. Hokey-sounding, maybe, but for a struggling teenager it changed the direction of my life."
968,Thanh Nguyen,Best book to read when you're taking psychology
969,Ginny,A must read for everyone. Great book.
970,Monica,"I would re-read this book every year of my life. The name sounds just awful, but actually this is a wonderful book... the main message is, the way you win friends and influence people is you show them you genuinely care. Really good little ideas on how you can do this in your every day life."
971,John Anglis,"The most powerful book I've ever read.Honest to god, I was NOT a very likable person growing up. I had maybe 2 friends. No girlfriends, got in fights every year. Never got along with anyone. I read this book and it changed me for the better.Every where I go now, I can make friends with anyone. This book has helped me become a better salesman as well for my job.At the same time, this book can be used for evil. I've used this book in seduction-and it has increased my dates tremendously. I can get someone who's incredibly mad at me for anything, to forgive me within minutes. I can use these techniques to con people, play them and get what I want. Very, very powerful book. One that I will continue to read over and over again.But enough talking me, my life isn't nearly as interesting as yours. Tell me more about yours? "
972,Karl-Friedrich Lenz,"Pasted from Lenz Blog, published there on October 10, 2011This book has its own shiny Wikipedia entry. Authored by Dale Carnegie and first published in 1936, it has sold over 15 million copies since.My interest for the last half year in writing this blog is in advocacy related to global warming. If I am bothering at all, I prefer to get the most impact for my efforts. “Influencing people” is therefore an interesting topic.I have just finished writing every word of that book in a file on my personal computer. Copyright for the book has expired in Japan, but this is privileged use anyway, since I am not giving anyone any copies but am just doing that as a method to read the book attentively, which is privileged under Article 30 of the Japanese copyright law as “personal use.”I think that many of the suggestions in this book make sense, and am looking forward to applying some of them.I even found some mistakes in the process. After all these years, page 76 cites “Shakespear” and on page 101 there is the sentence “You want to approval of those with whom you come in contact.”"
973,booklady,"Re-read (or rather re-listened to) this, as I promised myself I was going to do when I got it last year. I really think the title is misleading. It should be something like, How to Have Healthier, Happier and More Positive Relationships with People. This time I actually got to put some of the principles of this book into practice when tutoring an unwilling 7th grader. Receiving D's and F's and reading at 3rd grade level, ""M"" is not unintelligent. She is just one (of the many) child(ren) pushed through the system ready or not.Anyway, when M failed to respond to my charming personality, I realized that I needed to find what interested and motivated her. Ever since, we have been gradually building a relationship based on who she is, what she wants, and how I can help her. Admittedly I started at a very low level (candy for good performance!) but it got her attention and we are slowly making progress, little by little each week. Anyway, she at least talks to me now and doesn't hide behind her long hair anymore. This last week I challenged her to show me her first test or quiz, in any class, above 80% and promised an unspecified reward.Thank you Mr. Carnegie!<><><><><><>Recently a good friend and colleague told me how much this book helped her and I remembered how much I enjoyed it when I first read it (years ago). As I could hardly remember any specifics from that distant time—only the overall favorable impression—I learned a great deal from this reread. The author and my friend both recommend returning to the principles of this book at least once @ year. Based on my own desire to have happy and positive human relations I agree this is a worthwhile book. I hope to make reading/listening to it something I do every January. We all need to get along and this book is chock full of helpful ideas for improving all of our relations with others. It isn't about using other people to get what we want, except insofar as we learn how to achieve happy, loving relationship(s), mutual respect and peaceful homes/workplaces.Highly recommended! "

As a salesman and aspiring actor, he traveled to New York and began teaching communication classes to adults at the YMCA. In 1912, the world famous Carnegie Course was born. He authored several best-sellers, including, “How to win Friends and Influence People”, and “How to stop worrying and start living.” Over 50 million copies of Mr. Carnegie's books have been printed and published in 38 languages. Mr. Carnegie was a prominent lecturer of his day and a sought-after counselor to world leaders. He wrote newspaper columns and had his own daily radio show.

977,Frank Cardenas,"The writer did not get it wrong when he chose the title 'How to...', an amazing timeless book you can read to help you in your everyday life. No matter what your profession is, you will find that the principles described by the author apply to any situation you find yourself in. I read this book a long time ago and I still remember the satisfaction I experienced on each page I was devouring: easy-to-read, with very realistic examples and full of simple techniques, this book should be made mandatory when you are at highschool; I'm not joking, it is exactly at that time that we're forming our personality, by reading such an amazing book, we will have more chance to react to situations in a most intelligent way and grasp the opportunities that are always there.The funny thing is, although I read it at highschool, I still seem to remember some of the techniques as if I had read it recently; I am not sure, though, if I am applying them correctly, you might ask my friends...

979,Alex,Must have rules with great examples.
980,Fay Wu,"excellent book!I really love the advice he gave in this book, and especially appreciated all the examples listed from history and his personal experience. I think it is especially important that he emphasized being genuine and sincere because I can see how the book's advice could also be applied in a fake and bad manner. I plan on trying to remind myself and incorporate many of these tips in my interactions for people!"
981,Alessandra Renzi,"É sicuramente un libro molto utile per imparare a relazionarsi con gli altri anche nella vita di tutti giorni... Qualcuno affermò: ""la gentilezza è rivoluzionaria"", questo libro ne è la conferma.Sebbene ricco di aneddoti e fatti storici si legge molto facilmente. Consigliato!!"

985,Jen Whittaker,"Amazing book! If you have a pre-teen or teenage girl, a must read for you and them!"
986,John Mortenson,"Excellent book on the habits one might cultivate to be nice. Contrary to what the title may suggest, what you really do is earn people's admiration and trust by taking an interest in people, giving credit to others, and smiling.

990,Vicki Dull,A classic with basic interpersonal skills
991,Benjamin Sigrist,"An excellent book that is surprisingly readable for a book first penned in 1936... and just as applicable today as it was then. This is definitely one to read again periodically... Yes, much of it is common sense today, but it is definitely worth a read through, if only for the inspiring anecdotes on historical figures like Lincoln, Charles Schwab, and others. Carnegie handily breaks the book down into several sections on social-interaction with a handful of principles in each. Fundamental Techniques in Handling People-Don't criticize, condemn, or complain-Give honest and sincere appreciation-Arouse in the other person an eager wantSix Ways to Make People Like You-Become genuinely interested in other people-Smile-Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language-Be a good listener.

Be ""hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.""-Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to-Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct-Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest***If I could summarize the book down into one principle, it would be this... Yes, it is the golden rule, and fairly obvious, but it is something that many (including me) often fail to consider before speaking. Great read though... and surprising. I went into it thinking it was a classic I should read, but not expecting to be such an easy, fluid read... This is one I suspect I will read many times throughout my life, and I'd love to hand it down to my children..."
992,Larry Cassesa,"First influential based book that I read. Being in sales, being a father, and being a community member this book provides a basis for allowing you to see how to best utilize your time and hone your skills for more success. Daily, we interact with other human beings, and this book helps you focus on how to be an effective communicator. "
993,Michele Pratusevich,"I think this book should be on everyone's reading lists. Although it is old and Dale Carnegie sounds quite presumptuous throughout the entire book, his main message is one I think people should adopt as their own. Through many personal examples and stories, he sends the same message for what he calls the ""secret to success."" I wouldn't say this is the only quality you need, but it is an important one to take to heart."
994,Ashley Smith,I really like this book - thanks Amanda!
995,Piece Of MinD,"One of the best,if not THE best, self-development book,i love the sarcastic style of carnegie.and it still works even after years and yearsbut still the right deal when it comes to dealing with people."
996,Eliot Ho Wai Kwan,It's a MUST READ book in life time.
997,Bruce Jones,"There is a tide in the affairs of man, which taken at the flood leads on to fortune, etc, etc.I know what you are thinking. You're thinking, hey, that sounds good. That Shakespeare (for obviously the words are his), I reckon he was really on to something there. It would be a good topic for a self-help book in fact. I would have chapters called, ""locating your inner beach"", ""swimming to connect"" and ""mastering the management wave"" or some such like. The book could be called ""Flood AquaticKing - the seven principles of tide management theory for the fish generation."" Alright, alright: I'll admit it. I can't bear self-help books. Mostly they are patronising and rather disingenuous entreaties that you can have anything if you just stop being shy and try a bit harder. A plethora of TV talent shows have grown like topsy and thrived on this mantra, that its not talent that matters, its effort and yearning that really counts. There is however one honourable exception, the original grandaddy of all self-help books. Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends & Influence People"".It may not be the best written book in the world. It has a folksy, down at home style and it's pretty repetitive in places, but at heart it contains real insight into human nature and what makes people tick. I've seen some claims that the book is only really relevant to sales people and that the application of the principles of the book beyond the sales arena is a little creepy and liable to make you cringe. That's unfair and to maintain as much is to focus too narrowly and too literally on the case studies the book contains by way of illustration of its central tenets. Viewed properly, the book offers the sort of guidance that is just not taught in the classroom amongst the Physics and the History and the Maths. It lucidly explains that most valuable of skills, how to deal with people, and to my mind, it ought to be compulsory reading for every teenage school leaver."
998,Jane Johnson,Make someone smile today
999,Anthony Tenaglier,An excellent read! Essential fundamentals to recognize when interacting with others. I feel as though this book should be read once a year to refresh one's memory if anyone wishes to better their communication with other people.

1008,Barbara,This is one of the few books I have ever read that I have kept with the intention of reading it again!
1009,Brian Stewart,"A must for sales professionals, management, human service professionals, and anyone who encounters people in their work or outside life. Dale Carnegie uses his unique perspective, dozens of interviews, and research that included hundred of books, manuscripts, and letters to analyze, synthesize, and condense the silver bullet of human relationships into a little less than 300 pages. This book more than delivers what it promises, assuming that the reader follows the principles set forth and one refreshes those principles periodically. Definitely a classic, and definitely a recommended read for almost everyone I know (some need it more than others)."
1010,Silver Kuklase,Great book. This is the one you will probably go through more than once. Glad I read it.
1011,Israel Goncalves,"this book shows details that make a difference, and that is extremely applicable and of great importance"
1012,Erik Potter,"I always thought this book was about how to be a greedy creep and be rewarded for it. Turns out its full of great advice about how to be a thoughtful, nice person, which comes with its own rewards. Excellent book. "
1013,Adrian Dahlin,One of the most helpful books I've ever read. I plan to pull it out again every year.
1014,Meleny, This book is a very helpful source for teens such as myself. This book is like a teacher. It has different lessons and advices to know and learn. I learned many things from this book that i've never thought of that'll work. What this book teaches is how to win friends the right way and how to influence people just like the title says. When I read this title I thought who made this book like I have several friends and I know what the right way to gain friends and I thought that there is no wrong way to win friends. Yes there isn't a wrong way to win friends but this book helps you out how to win friends and/or influence people the most professional way.  This book was actually a gift from my dad. So I guess I did need another way how to win friends and specially to influence people. The first thing my told me was here read this book you need it. I didn't take it offensively because I already know that my dad sarcasms too much. So I took the challenge and started to read and I thought that it'll be a good idea to be my outside reading and share what I think about this book. Some things about this book that caught my attention was that it was a person talking to me directly and talking teen language. Also how i understood what it was trying to say because in other books that i've read i had to read over twice or thrice to understand it. In my opinion this book does actually change people's way of thinking. Me myself I did change they way of thinking and learned that the bad things I've done that makes me look like a bad person. Overall this book is a vry helpful and teachful book to read for teen girls. 
1015,Lionkhan-sama,"This is one of those rare books that deserves an honest 11/10 rating. Superb, classy and very easily read.A compilation of simple yet effective lessons, which if carried out will propel you into the forefront of people handlers. Although it is a book of lessons, it is written in such an accessible and enjoyable style, that you can't help but want to continue reading it.Truly a book to be read, reread and then reread once again to enhance your life in every way possible, through bettering the way you deal with others."
1016,Drew Crumpton,"This book is great if you want to improve communication skills. It is made up of ""principals"" to follow when communicating with others. Here are some of the principals I got the most out of:Principle No 1: Don’t Criticize, Condemn or ComplainYou should try to understand that people may not necessarily be wrong and it could actually be you who’s wrong. Try to see another persons’ point of view by trying to understand why that person acts this way. This exercise alone can give you a significant understanding of another person. Not many people can see both their and others’ points of view.Principle no 3: Remember the names of the people you meetWow! This is a big one for me and it is sooooo hard but soooooo important in the business world. It can be an extremely powerful tool because someone's name is personal and if you remember people’s names, they normally think positive things about you. According to the author, here is an unconscious process going on in the minds of the people whom you call by their first names when you've just met them.Principle no 6: Say something nice to a personDuh, but hardly anyone does it. "
1017,rogue,"I was always too snobby to read this book, so I'm grateful that someone turned me around & recommended it to me. These are the basics of social grace and so there isn't any revelatory information, but this book shines because of clear, timeless examples from sources like Abraham Lincoln & Ben Franklin. Its principles are things everyone should know, but may somehow have failed to learn if they've spent too much time living within themselves instead of paying attention to other people. "
1018,Shing Chen,Read it before getting a highly competitive sales job position that's based on full commission. Carnegie explains human social strategies in through examples.
1019,Jevon Gondwe,Life is all about relationships. This book really helps you see things from the others point of view and helps you both get what you want. The keys is this book are so simple and easy and yet few people actually apply them in life. It has helped me have more confidence with my interactions with people and I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to strengthen their people skills. 
1020,Aroona,بدأت قراءته في الثانوية ومازلت أعود إليه!
1021,Edwin Canlapan,Great read. I suggest teenagers read this book. it will help them deal with people from their teenage years and beyond.
1022,Joshua,I would highly recommend this to anyone.

1024,Vito Colano,After reading this book and using it's advice I was happiest I'd ever been in my life save travelling. 
1025,Ajit José,The most influencing book ever i red...
1026,Genomar,Fantastic book!
1027,Darrell,A classic! The ultimate guide on getting along with folks. And the best part (although it is NOT pointed out in the text) is that these are sound principles that can be backed up with God's Word.
1028,Simon Dot,Love the analogies and stories. Make perfect sense. Some were just repeating though or rather similar.I love the Lincoln references.
1029,Daoning Zhou,Some times it helps to just read about the effective habits of dealing with people to make you be more introspective of your actions.Carnegie's clear writing style and storytelling ability makes this an easy and delightful read.
1030,Ngoc,"My 1st time reading the book is probably when I was in grade 5. It was the translated version, called ""Dac Nhan Tam"". I was too young to understand what the book was really about then, but I was very into the stories that Carnegie told. One of the stories I have always remembered is where the author saw a group of children start a fire in the forest. How he dealt with the children to persuade them to be more careful next time, in a very polite and persuasive but gentle manner, has left a strong impression in me till now.I don't remember the 2nd or 3rd or 4th... time reading the book. I just remember when I was in grade 11 or 12 I found an article saying 7 Habits of Stephen Covey is the genuine self-improvement guidance while How to Win Friends is a manual which only create fake personalities, I stopped thinking about reading this book again. When I went to Goodreads, I rated it 3, based on the last feeling I remembered about the book.This year 2015, for several reasons I decided to pick up this book again. I wanted to see how I perceive the book after a very long time not reading it and compare it to 7 Habits, which I'd reread before. And the book didn't fail me. I've come to understand it in a whole new light. While 7 Habits is kind of a systematic approach, How to Win Friends is more intuitive. 7 Habits and How to Win Friends don't conflict with each other at all, but they are perfect companions for each other. "
1031,Mckay," In this book, Dale Carnegie explains the importance of being friendly to all. It gives many examples of people in the real world who have influenced others by being kind and genuinely interested in them. He informs the reader that someones name is the most important word in any given language. Using the name shows that this person means a lot to you.(No movie made from book) I would recommend this book to readers of all ages. This book teaches the reader about life. The author has amazing values that he is sharing with you. He gives you guidance to become successful in anything you wish to achieve."
1032,Parker Larson,Really enjoyed this classic. Principles to live by and Carnegie provides several great examples. 
1033,Kirat Randhawa,Amazing Book. Thanks to my Father for gifting me one to read :)
1034,Chris Gorycki,A great book! This is a book I will revisit annually.
1035,Shaun Davis,Amazing!
1036,Vincent De snerck,amazing. will read many more times.
1037,Niloofar,Great book to apply to your business and personal life. If only we were all so understanding of the human interaction. 
1038,Phoebe Hall,"This book should be your personal ""bible"" to maintaining friendships and networking."
1039,Peter Perhac,"maybe not really a five-star book, I found it amazingly good and think this should be mandatory reading in high schools / colleges. The book ends abruptly but that's perhaps for the best."
1040,Col Sunzu-lu,"This is a great book. It teaches principles that are very important to anyone that wants to gain more influence amongst people. Some of the principles that I found to be very down to earth and common sense are ""be loyal to the absent"" I find that a lot of people do not realize how much gossip is so detrimental to reputation. Once we realize and prevent it at all costs we will find our selves much more likeable. That is just to name one important principle found within the book. It is a great read indeed!"
1041,dennis demski,I think this really is a great book on the qualities a leader should have. Often we think of people as objects to be manipulated and not human beings.
1042,Frank Deschain,This is one of those books that can be referred back to over and over again. It's a great manual and continues to be relevant for every generation.
1043,Benny John,I don't have much to say about this book. Because everything has been already said. I cannot say I have finished this book. I will re-read it again. I knew everything what has been said in this book. But I didn't realize this. The book has really changed my approach to people and all the thoughts in the books are still haunting me. I was really lucky that I was able to read the book. Thanks Dale for giving us this gift.
1044,Ershad Ganjy,I read this book every 4-6 months. I need to be reminded of the points he make and stories to support them. You cannot just read the book get inspired for two weeks and forget about it later. You need to read and do it until they turn to habit. This book makes you be a blessing to life of others and that kids is how you win your friends. :)
1045,Amylia,"Great book. I first picked it up at the library at 12 years old and read it again in college, many years later. "
1046,Sergej Müller,Ignore the cheesy title. This is one of the best books on human relationships and the way of life I've read so far. 
1047,Charlie,"In fairness I have this book on Audio tape, love it and listen to it on many a long drive. It gives great advice and is quite an effective aid in improving ones dealings with people."
1048,Evan Wondrasek,"This book is important. Sure, it's got a goofy old title. And it was written a long time ago. But this book literally tells you how to be a good person.There are so few things you can do in life that are truly meaningful, and one of those is being a good person. Like a real, honest, good person. This book talks about how to do that.""Kill them with kindness"" is the overarching theme of this book in my opinion, and it's a good one. Whether with family, friends, or business, I think Carnegie's ideas can solve a lot of problems. As an independent software developer, I get a few emails from people occasionally upset about something that isn't working quite right. They're used to dealing with some faceless, giant software corporation, so they don't know there's just one guy from the Midwest United States behind that email address, reading each one of their emails carefully. So whenever I get an email that might be a big on the inflammatory side, I just take a lesson from this book and be a good person. It's amazing what a positive attitude, gratefulness, sympathy and forgiveness can do.I'll be reading this one a few more times I think. Highly recommend. And I won't complain if someone changes this book's title."
1049,Muhammad Ali,Easy to follow advices with real world examples. A perfect recipe for a training manual
1050,Casey Christy,"Timeless, practical book on understanding human nature. Good story telling to illustrate points. Highly recommend."
1051,ashleyTIA,"If more people read this book, the world would be a different place. "
1052,Amor,Book of my parents...I read this when I was still a teen...one of the biggest influences in my life.
1053,Patty,So far this is a page turner and an excellent self help book if your feeling like you just arent getting along in the workplace with ppl or even in life this book is helpful:)
1054,Haelly Kirk,"To this day, I reference this book in any leadership classes I take in order to enhance their understanding of people skills and cement my own people skills. This book teachers you the best ways of working with people and knowing the best way to go about all types of social situations. A MUST READ FOR SOCIAL SKILL SURVIVAL!"
1055,Justin Owens,"This book is a perennial read. So practical, so accessible, and still so needed in our society. In summary, it's a book about tact. I like it most for it's tips on helping to express interest in people and recognizing how much everyone craves good relationships. While at times the techniques come across as having skin-deep sincerity, I feel like sometimes you just need to fake it until you can make it. He talks about sincerity, but for a more ""inside out"" approach to good relationships ""7 Habits"" (another perennial favorite) is a good complementary read. "
1056,Paige Hackler,"Excellent. And so much of it is common sense. Apparently, common sense is what so many are lacking these days!"
1057,Joan,"read many years ago, i am sure this book must be very dated. at the time I read this I was in my teens, different times, different views"
1058,Devin,Everybody should read this book if you want to be a better person.
1059,Sophie Parks,Reading this should be mandatory.
1060,Adnan Branbo,"Wonderful book, with great results"
1061,Chris Chandler,One of the classic works on human relations. Perhaps the best one ever written.
1062,Synnta Claus,This book has given me confidence. It helped me alot in terms of the way I communicated with my friends. And the rapport that I have built with them.
1063,Haitham Arshid,"Wow!So simple, so obvious but can make you think positively! Maybe in the digital age it's a little bit different but still good piece."
1064,Lacey,I have read it twice and I am just starting it again! It teaches true principles in dealing with people.
1065,Dave Walker,"An incredibly useful book. These strategies are all so great - I've benefited so much from thinking about them and trying to apply them in my life. Most of the book is filled with examples illustrating the principles suggested. I felt like it was quite repetitive, but this actually ended up being more helpful than annoying, as the repetition engrained the information in my mind. So glad I finally got around to reading this."
1066,Bob Wallner,"I found this book simply amazing! I'm disappointed that it took me until now to read it. I truly believe this book should be required reading in any universities leadership or management program. Whether you are in business setting or simply want some sound advice on how to handle people, this book is fantastic.Dale Carnegie mixes theory with actual examples to keep the reader's interest. Although his writing is decades-old, it is as relevant today as ever.When I was a new manager, I made so many of the mistakes that Carnegie points out. It has taken time but my personality now matches what he recommends. There is always room for improvement, and Mr Carnegie points that out too."
1067,Cori,"This is an excellent book. It infuses enough humor in the topic to keep the audience engaged, and the tools are very applicable to real world situations. (view spoiler)[Part 3: Win people to your way of thinking:1: The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it2: Show respect for the other person's opinions, never say ""you're wrong""3: If you are wrong admit it quickly and emphatically4: Begin in a friendly way5: Get the other person saying, ""yes, yes"" immediately6: Let the other person do a great deal of the talking7: Let the other person feel that the idea is hers8: Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view9: Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires10: Appeal to the nobler motives11: Dramatize your ideas12: Throw down a challenge  (hide spoiler)]Bonus Material:Dale Carnegie [Leadership] TrainingHow to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age"
1068,Alex Fontanetta,"This is a brillant insight into human nature. Carnegie isn't content to merely discuss philosophy though. Well ahead of his time, he uses his knowledge, his humor, and countless real-life narratives to posit a brillant approach to living."
1069,Andd Becker,This classic is still useful after all these years.
1070,Joel Goldberg,"This book was one of those life-changers for me. I recommend it to anyone who wants to become a better person, more personable, conscientious, and impacting on people around you."
1071,Chris Hill,"fantastic book everyone should read, couldn't put it down. Nearly 80 years old but still very relevant, thought provoking & motivational. Will read again"
1072,Hyrum,Must read 
1073,Cory,"While many of the ideas seem obvious, the stories are wonderful, and the writing heatfelt. Everyone should give it a read, some perhaps more than others ☺️"
1074,Josefindeiving,Classic! Very good and timeless!
1075,Valorie,Mostly loved this book because its perfect for a social retard like me. I needed every lesson in it. I have it easily accesible and reread it frequently. Maybe one day I'l learn.
1076,Stephen Floyd,"Favorite Quotes: ""Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain - and most fools do. But it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving."""
1077,wly,Really good book. Basically. How to go beyond respect.
1078,Ashlie,I agree with your estimation of Carnegie's masterpiece. The more I manage and try to lead people the more I realize why this was and is such a revolutionary book. So many people struggle with even the simplest of interpersonal interaction and virtually no one is a master of it.
1079,Stacy Beck,"This book is a fantastic read for everyone! It's applicable to everyday circumstances at home, community, or work. I would recommend to read it more than once!"
1080,Erica,"I found this book to be very insightful, and I expect the concepts it discusses to be vry useful in handling people."
1081,Yuting,"I purchased this book 6 years ago and I have read this book many times over, each time the book becomes more meaningful and insightful. It is an amazingly clear book that explains why and how some people are socially suave and how you can become that way too.This book is fundamental for any professional seeking to win people over to their thinking, build relationships and networks, and to expand your social circle and social skills.It is truly a shame that the skills and knowledge in this book is not taught in our schools today."
1082,CHRISTINE ALEXANDER,wonderful. nothing to say more
1083,Saifuddin Merchant,"I should have read this book long ago. Considering that its been over 60 years that the author wrote the book its amazed me with its simplicity. In the few pages that I have read, I can already see how I can improve myself leaps and bounds. I have read a couple of other self help books --Seven Habits of highly effective people and 92 way on How talk to anyone but found this much more interesting and intuitive to apply!!Hats of to Dale Carnegie:)!"
1084,Dan Oliver,This book is fantastic. I can't recommend it highly enough. Learn how to deal with people.
1085,Yamato,Great read with many examples.Concepts are so simple and seem obvious but so hard to follow in real life!
1086,Jack Gibson,"I made about 2 pages of notes when reading this, as it is just one of those books where you have to in order to soak in what you are reading.At the end of those two pages, I wrote: ""Concluding, an interesting book and many people do a Carnegie course. Ultimately though, I will continue to be myself in life, but it was interesting to read about how human minds work and how motivation works."
1087,Sheila,Loved it. Everyone should read this. Wonderful reminders and info for all ages!
1088,Marcelo Cé martins,An enticing book. A must-read for everyone who wants to improve their hability to get along with people and do better business in general. It also shows an important lesson on decency and good social manners. I'm looking forward towards reading the other Dale Carnegie manuals - I'm sure they'll be written in the same light-heated manner.
1089,Tiffany,A must read for everyone. Great people skills book.
1090,Mary Cravets,"When I first heard the title of this book, I truly thought it was about manipulating others and persuading them against their will, so I resisted reading it for a very long time. I finally picked it up after having it recommended about 10 times. My initial belief could not have been further from the truth.This book is about being friendly, kind, generous, encouraging, tactful, humble and inspiring. It is a must read for any entrepreneur. Actually, it's a must read for every human- I believe people would get along better if they took to heart some of the principles in this book.And it was very humorous, with lots of stories and examples making for a very pleasant and easy read."
1091,Noura,It shows how we should appreciate people and be treat them better.Very important lesson I love this book I want to read it over and over agin 
1092,Leigh,Everyone should read this book at least once.
1093,Jose Gonzalez,"Excelent book, a book that everyone should read"
1094,Eric Kleiman,The best book out there on people skills!
1095,Sean Helvey,This book honestly changed my life! Definitely worth a read.
1096,Andrew Grossbach,Really a great read. This should be required reading in high school or at minimum college. 
1097,Lauren MacMillan,Timeless!
1098,Alana Munro,"This book is essential reading for any young person. Dale shares his life wisdom in a simple, easy to read manner. I particularly like his wit. Enjoyable, eye-opening read! "
1099,Carly Movius,I know 100% of these strategies! But reviewing these is so refreshing!
1100,Kristiina,A must read for everybody. Too often and too easily we tend to criticize people. We tend to only think about ourselves. However the key to good relations is to think about other people. This book contains a lot of tips on how to become better with people and make your life easier when it comes to any kind of relationships.
1101,Nora,Awesome book if you want to add value to yourself. 
1102,Cristian Marrero,Amazing audiobook. Definitely worth hearing. Structured through different principles with many examples to help you change your mentality. 
1103,Coleman,"This book requires note taking, and it'll be a major disservice to you if you don't go over those notes at least once every six months."
1104,Norm,A blue chip standard of relating to people in business and personal life.
1105,Frederik Larsen,"an awesome book with an amazing inside to how and why we do what we do. It is also really pratical in your eeveryday life. I really recommends it to everybody, especially to business people."
1106,Dominik Ley,"A good guide for all aspects of live, personal or professional."
1107,Ben Wilde,"This is a ""classic"" that is worth reading time and time again. The principles discussed are logically sound, but less easy to consistently perform. I especially like the many concrete examples demonstrating the taught principles in action. Thanks to those who recommended it. I now need to get my own copy to reread and mark-up."
1108,Janelle,This is one of our family classics.

1110,Chirs,"This is good book about how to communicate with other people, even strangers. In our life, we should not blame others too much. We’d better find problems on ourselves. We also need to praise others, so that they can be more confident and be close to the success. Besides, we need to think for others. When they have problems, they may be shy to tell you. At that time, if you take the initiative to help, they may feel very warm. Every day we go to school, we should be confident and happy instead of bored and tired. We need to bring a good mind to the school. If we fall in the exam, don’t be sad. Never mind, relax, you can be better next time. This book also tells us how to make a good family. I think the first step is the sense of responsibility. We should take care of our family and be honest to every member in the family. Spending more time with your family is also important. That will makes the family more harmonious. I really like this book and it is very useful for me."
1111,Allegra Hailey Green,"I love this book and everything it stands for. It really makes you think about how you treat people and cites interesting examples from historical leaders such as Abraham Lincoln and Benjamin Franklin.I wish someone would update or re-write something this good for dealing with appearance and relationships in the digital age, since social media has changed a lot of how we interact in personal and business relationships. "
1112,Navya Bharathi,"Worthwhile reading this book, author Dale Carnegie, conveyed us how to handle people and make them friends. He explains with examples, that makes us to understand, how to react to the people in positive way in any situation. Some of the principles that we have to follow are Don't criticize, condemn or complain. Give honest and sincere appreciation. Smile. Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, ""You're wrong."".If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. If we follow the rules, it will help us to handle any situation and maintains a good relationship with people in our life. "
1113,Bassem,Should've been taught to every single person in school growing up. Love this book. I applied it immediately and results are real! 
1114,Willi Braun,Probably the best book ever written. So much truth in every sentence he wrote. I just love that book and can read it again and again.
1115,Aileen,"A great book. Timeless considering when it was written. I expected it to actually bore me, how wrong was I! I found it fascinating yet so so simple, ill definitely need to read it again, I have a social awkwardness and shyness that can cripple me and I feel everyone should pick this book up and give it a chance. Not because of my own reasons but because it teaches us to be nice to people, to want to be nice, not to manipulate or bully. Will pass this on to my daughter when she's old enough to appreciate the words."
1116,Ami Doshi,"Timeless treasure. I can't believe this was written in the 30s... definitely a book to share with friends and family, regardless of age. "
1117,Bressain Dinkelman,"Oh man, I plan on re-reading this every few years or so. A few things seem to be out of date with some modern psychology but the vast majority of the techniques all feel super legit and have even been reiterated by more modern books on similar topics. Highly recommended."
1118,Vignesh P T,A book that needs reading many times to keep one-self on track. A very good book overall.
1119,Kelli,"I love this book and have started rereading it. I tried it as a social experiment, and the affects were immediate and positive. I loved the experience of seeing it in action. i highly recommend reading and applying it to your own life."
1120,Sharyn,Still one of my all time favorites!
1121,Matteo,A great book that encourages you to think again about your habits during conversations.
1122,Aku,"For a book published in 1936, it has remained highly relevant today (2013). There has to be something right about the book & you have to see that for yourself.One of the oldest Western books in my collection that is principally centred. Each one will have a different lesson to take away."
1123,Umar Maaz,best book ever
1124,Rachel Klingbeil,This is an incredible book! Changed the way I think about conversations with people and has helped me to become a more selfless person when I'm in a conversation! Carnegie really puts things into perspective! This isn't a read for a certain type of people..it's a must read for everybody who wants to be a good friend and an approachable person!
1125,Kelly,"Another awesome book from Dale Carnegie. Great examples, great principles."
1126,Mark S.,Great book!
1127,Gerald Mcnair,All Dale Carnegie books are outstanding and necessary reading. Simply the best set of self-improvement books you will ever find.
1128,John Jinks,"Its amazing that a book written roughly 75 years ago has so much useful and helpful points that still apply today. While the world has changed quite a bit since Dale Carnegie fisrt wriote this book, how people want to be treated and spoken to hasn't.Regardless of your current situation in life, you can learn something valuable from this book. If you have never read this book, it is a definite MUST READ."
1129,Begoña,"Ya comprendo por qué es un clásico. Muchísimas son cosas que sabía, pero es un gran resumen y reafirma verlas por escrito."
1130,Greg Webb,"For years I avoided this book, as I found the title to be a little off-putting.  I was worried the content was going to be full of sleaze like so many others in this niche I've wasted my time with (*cough*RobertGreene*cough*).  A clear-cut case of 'judging a book by its cover'.  Given it's timelessness and consistent recommendation​, I decided to 'get it over with'....   Wow!  Despite it's origination date, I really enjoyed this book and found it's content to hold up.  If only I'd let go of my reservations years prior, I probably could have saved myself years of frustration and anguish in dealing with people (especially the argumentative and/or ""me, me, me"" types).This is another book I'm going to have to revisit - multiple times, most likely - in order to absorb and put into practice all the principles laid out for us."
1131,David Davis,Read it. Learn it. Live it. 
1132,Laura Varela,It makes you rethink the way in which you act daily. A must to improve relationships with others.
1133,Sri Hari Prasadh Radhakrishnan,"one of the best books I have read... after reading it, I recommend think how you can apply the techniques learnt in the book to your own life as each person is unique and would have been exposed to different scenarios.... easily understandable...."
1134,I_love_a_happily_ever_after,"This book was much more than what the title claims it to be. I found it more to be about being a better friend, co-worker, spouse, human than just winning more friends. If people everywhere read this book and took it to heart our world would be a much better place, indeed. Common courtesy, patience, and the ability to see a situation from another's prospective are lost arts in this age of communication via e-mails, texts and snapchats. I wish everyone in the world all had Mr. Carnegie's kindness and thoughtfulness. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be a better person inside and out. "
1135,Kristiann,An oldie but goodie. I really liked it.
1136,Roger Rojas,"In order to get the most out of this book, one must take the time to really break down what was just read. The content of this book-as many have said-is very simple, but also very powerful. When you take the time to study the techniques, learn how to implement them, and actually put them into practice, you have a solid return of your time and money. As mentioned in the first couple of pages in the book, it is very easy to forget the principles if you don't constantly strive to perfect them in everyday life, so it is recommended to read each chapter more than once and then put what you learned into action (I agree!). It takes time for it to become second nature, but once you have it all down, you will definitely see peoples interaction with you change for the better.I recommend this book to everyone! "
1137,Chukwuma Asala,People love to talk about one thing: themselves.
1138,Sami,"If you are from the league who thinks criticizing, condemning and ridiculing does the job every time, this is for you. The author shows how a little compassion, appreciation and consideration can help you to influence people to get the job done.This will teach you a different approach towards your social and professional relations."
1139,Nikki,"I absolutely LOVE this book. I read it in college, and it was a great way for me to improve myself, but it didn't make me feel bad. It made me have more confidence and become a more well-rounded person. Highly recommended, no matter how introverted or extroverted you view yourself."
1140,Ivan Peevski,"Very good book about how to communicate with people (elements of psychology and sociology presented in a very down to earth way, using stories as examples)"
1141,Brett Kopf,"Fantastic book, the art of human relations. "
1142,Kristina Hollis,Was a bit of a life-changer for me :)
1143,Bobby Williams,This book made a huge change in my life. Very useful in learning (or re-learning) basic interpersonal skills. I am even teaching my daughter some of the steps in it to help her at school!
1144,Jacek Korzeniowski,Must read for every manager or salesman !
1145,Wan Siti,Pilih rakan dan dorong manusia dengan cara yang sama..Setiap manusia adalah mad'u dan andalah jua yang memilih untuk mengadaptasi setiap yang dilihat dengan bijak!
1146,Tomas,"A must read for everyone, preferably once every year"
1147,Joe Lopardo,This was an absolute classic and must read. It has become my hand book to all personal interactions. This has become on of my top book reads of all time and something that I contently refer back to for advice and guidance. 
1148,Tawni,"I really enjoyed this book. Very common sense stuff like remembering people's names and smiling, but such a good reminder. Hope I can influence my kids now and win a ton of friends :) I hope to reread this book in the future to remind me its concepts."
1149,Hitesh,All time Favourite ...Long Live Dale
1150,Dania Assi,We all seek self and social improvement and this is the book to do so! i recommend it highly and i believe it should be studied like a course in schools and universities because in order for us to develop as humans it is very important to know how to deal with people and how to win them. I love it the section where he wrote tips in how to get the best of the book. I am inspired by Dale story of success and i will read all his other books!
1151,Arica Morgan,I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. I am learning a lot. I am learning how to win friends and influence people
1152,Libromaniac,"I give it five stars. Feel free to disagree but keep in mind ""you can never win an argument""."
1153,Punne,Got hired because of this book. Thanks
1154,Michael,Want to be liked? Read this book.
1155,Adam DeBoer,"This book is by far the most amazing personal relations/communication book I've ever come across. Normally I find myself drawn to titles by John C. Maxwell, but this book (written as an alternative textbook) is just too incredibly good to miss.If you ever plan to have a conversation with another human being, I strongly suggest you read this from front to back and follow the directions outlined in the beginning."
1156,Jolynn,"As old as this book may be it can teach anyone some valid lessons on how to work with people. Sure, the concepts are simple, though often forgotten. It serves as guidance to those wanting to lead a better/more fair life with others. What a great read especially for me considering I'm majoring in Business. "
1157,Fermin Quant,"A must read for everyone. This book should be a must read in every book in all the world, at least once a year, for every degree. If people knew the information inside this book, so many misunderstandings would be avoided between family, friends, co workers, customers, and between every human to human interaction.If you haven't read it yet, make the people in your life a favor, and yourself too, and read and apply it's wisdom daily. There are parts where it will make you want to cry for not knowing that stuff sooner, because of all the pain you could have avoided by behaving like it suggests. "
1158,Sander Roelandt,Life changing experience
1159,Sandie,"I do love this book...and anyone who would like to be successful in MLM or business in general should get a copy and work through the items. 1930's book, but still applicable."
1160,Dave Applegate,-Excellent introduction to the pseudo-science of developing win-win relationships. -I found the behaviors HTWFIP discusses were both effective and easy to implement. 
1161,Savannah,"DH had been pressuring me to read this book for AGES but it just did not appeal to me. I can make friends. I'm a good leader. And I have never enjoyed reading books that are basically informational, even if they are good. The only one I've ever finished before was ""Leadership and Self Deception"" and that was mostly because it is written in story form. However, this book is fantastic! You learn all sorts of wonderful things that help you to be a better friend, leader, parent, spouse... person! It's really wonderful! And you learn the lessons through reading a bunch of short stories that illustrate his different points. It really is great. I had a hard time putting it down! I was SHOCKED and know that it is a book I will read again. "
1162,Ram,"a cult classic, have read it umpteen number of times. don't mind reading it another 100 times"
1163,Ali Al-kubaisi,I cannot express how much i enjoyed and educated my self by reading this book. I will read it again in few months time to reinforce the knowledge i got out off it 
1164,Stephanie Dallas,This book is an interesting and insightful as I'd always heard. Makes me rethink my personality and the ways I interact with others. Lots of real world examples of his advice in action.
1165,Shillene,I read this for my Interpersonal Communications class and Loved it!
1166,Honza,Brilliant book about relationships.
1167,Tariq A,Really nice book - much better than the name sounds!
1168,David Ogilby,"The book is fantastic. The practices he encourages aren't new, I believe to a certain extent everyone subconsciously knows these traits are desirable but until Dale no one had taken the time to really dig into why they're desirable. Everyone should read this book, i loved it and will use it as a reference for years to come. "
1169,Tamara,Wow! Why have I not read this before? Brilliant!
1170,Liam,"Though nonfiction, and though it repeats itself several times, this book was phenomenal."
1171,Christine Tran,"After obtaining a sales/marketing job for a small company, I boss made all employees to read this book. My boss also had questions for every principle of the book for every section, which made the meetings more like a book club when we are in discussion. Book was wonderful and fascinating. My co-worker believed that this book addresses many ""common sense"" details, which I agreed on. However, to have the ability to outline the principles is something that requires a lot of experience, planning, and acknowledgement of little details learned on a daily basis. There are some principles that some people may have naturally acquire such as ""smiling"" or even ""saving face of another person."" Yet, there are other principles that other individuals may not learn and acknowledge the principle. I recommend that this book should be exposed to kids at the high school age, because I personally wished that I read this book prior to entering college. If I was able to read this book prior to entering college, I firmly believe that I would have a lot of easier time understanding how to learn and deal with people. "
1172,Anfal Alsultan,"A life changing book. It took a long reading time in order to try to apply what I read. Overall the book is v. good, it's suited to all kind of people. In two words; must read. Thank you Dale Carnegie, it's my first reading for you but it won't be the last!"
1173,Liz Wright,"I have heard for years that I should read this book, and now that I have finally gotten around to it, I found I really enjoyed it. Leaders, folks in sales, and literally every person in the world should read and understand the principles described in this book. Most of the chapters relate specifically to things I teach in my social psychology class, which made me happy because it shows the overlap between business, public speaking, and psychology that my students need to be able to see to relate to the content. This is definitely a book to buy, read, and re-read once per year to remind yourself of the principles."
1174,Debra,"Great book, definately one for the personal library. I read it after high school and have reviewed it many times since. "
1175,Casandra M.,Everyone should read this book. I read this book years ago once as a college student and didn't implement it into my life. I quickly learned that was a mistake. This is a must read for anyone who is serious about building relationships and growing their business network or career. This book is packed with practical wisdom that you need to use now.
1176,Jen Le,"A must read, and re-read each year, for everyone. "
1177,Joseph,One of my favorite all-time books. A morality book for atheists. Read more at http://paintroller.blogspot.com/2007/...
1178,Nick Huemmer,"Even though the title may seem a bit hackneyed and possibly cheesy, this 70 year old book is a great resource. I advise anyone (at least anyone that deals with people on a regular basis) to read this book. Dale Carnegie's approach to interacting with resolving conflicts and motivating others is straightforward and sensical. He wrote this book based on much of the contemporary psychology of the day-much of which is still relevant. It's a quick read full of anecdotes that are sometimes dated but all relevant. "
1179,Amanda Box,Classic book that everyone should read!
1180,Osama Abdelghany,اكثر ما يميز هذا الكتاب هو إعتماده على احداث وروايات حقيقية لاشخاص من انجلترا او امريكا او اى منطقه اخري فى العالم يعني يعتمد فى كلامه على احداث وقعت بالفعل لاشخاص نجحوا فى حياتهم بشكل فعلي -- كتاب جميل يستحق القراءه لكن تخير ترجمه جيده له او اقرأه بلغته الاصليه افضل
1181,Serdar,Great book with amazing and teaching stories about human interactions.
1182,Ross,"Invaluable in an age where being polite is optional and based upon one's ""feelings"" about another person. Everyone who expects to be, or desires to be a success in life should read this book. It's all about treating others as you would want to be treated. Truly timeless."
1183,Janis,"A must read for the human race. I prefer the first version the best, it loses something in the updated one."
1184,Yelena,"I have read this book first time when I was 19 years old. Absolutely loved all the practical advises that author offered. Now, I am in my late 30's and I feel like I need to refresh my memory on how to form personal relationships once more."
1185,zac helms,Great bookamazing read I can use every sentence in this book for real life application. I recommend this to anyone interested in leadership.
1186,Samuel,Dale Carnegie packs this book from cover to cover with easy to implement advice that spans the decade and still remains relevant today. This is a must read for readers who have a burning desire to improve their human relationships in any aspect. The advice is simple but often forgotten. 
1187,Robert Liburd,Wow! So deep and insightful. Just what the doctor ordered. 
1188,Dylan Stroke-Daddy Smith,"How to win friends and influence people is a book that was written by famous author Dale Carnegie in 1936, and has been used by many people in an effort to master the arts of getting what they want. Carnegie uses countless real life quotes and examples to enlighten all satisfactory individuals who bother to study its ways of human social interactions. A four part, 30 chapter ""social bible,"" this beauty can help even the least sociable of men to become not only an exceptional conversationalist, but an instant friend to anyone he, or she, may come in contact with. If someone asked me what the best way to make friends would be, I would simply hand them a copy of the book and instruct them to carefully read it at least twice and report back. Since Carnegie wrote the book in such easy to understand language, there are no prerequisites to reading and fully understanding it. I can testify that I have learned countless skills on how to do exactly what the title promises: winning friends and influencing people. Per completion of this book, I can now set simple factors into simple conversations, and simply change the way people feel about certain subjects. This is the beauty of the book; it teaches to sculpt the subconscious mind into almost whatever shape you desire. It is quite effective at doing this, which is why I would recommend it to anyone with the lust for a better social figure. On a scale of one to ten, this book would certainly break the scale. Carnegie goes above and beyond in an effort to help build American citizens' sociability. "
1189,Dave Warawa,"This book is one of my Top Five of All Time. If you interact with people, read it. How to Win Friends and Influence People was written from a training program that Dale Carnegie taught many years ago. It stands the test of time. 50 years from now, people will still find use and application for it in their everyday lives. When your book title has become a cliche and means of expression, you know it has become a brand onto itself."
1190,Janell Dirksen,This is what got me through the following all at the same time:- Long distance relationship- New career which meant moving to a new place with no friends/family- Realizing I'm poor and getting a 2nd job while starting my career and long-distance engagement- Planning my wedding by myself- Moving to SF with a new husband who was a long distance relationship for a year!Whew! I think it was a good eye opener! 
1191,Sascha,A classic. Title sounds cheesy today but the tools involved are helpful for anyone. I consider this a must read.
1192,Bryce,"This book is absolutely no gimmick. If you have trouble making friends or especially dealing with annoying people in the work place, you must read this book. It is recommended to be read every year and I suggest anybody to take that advise. Believe me, you will want to anyway."
1193,Parker Stewart,"Amazing book that gives great insight into how other people think and how to genuinely win them over with ""people skills."" I've read this book several times and find something new each time."
1194,Jenna Burns,"Absolutely fantastic book. I have read a few 'self-help' type books but none has resonated with me like this book has. It makes everything seem so easy, and achievable. I believe I can handle any situation now, I just hope it stays with me! "
1195,EB,After reading this I understand why it's a classic. I wonder why I waited so long to read it. It's an easy read and full of straight forward techniques to improve your communication and how others relate to you. In particular I loved the back section which was on how to give criticism in a positive way. How to help people not feel picked apart and demoralized by it. 
1196,Melanie Rach,"one of the best books I have read concerning people skills. Lots of great ideas, inspirational!"
1197,BriZen,"This is an excellent read. It might not be the most enthralling of reads, but the content is something everyone should absorb. I felt the urge to take notes many times as I was reading this book, and admittedly, I did take notes a few times. I feel the information is so important that I fully intend on going back and taking more detailed notes to incorporate some of this advice into my everyday life. The world would be a better place if we all lived by just one of these tenants:""Be hearty in your approbation, and lavish in your praise."" - Charles Schwabb"
1198,Melissa Falgier,"I just love reading this book. I placed in the bottom of the pile of books to read in 2014. I always love to read this. It reminds me of things I do correctly in handling people, and things I can improve on :) "
1199,Allison,One of my all time favourites. A book you can come back to and review again and again. 
1200,Suzanne,"This is a fantastic book, one I read over and over again."
1201,Elizabeth Lauer,"I enjoyed this book a lot mostly because I am stubborn and the book reiterates lots of very simple and basic rules for communicating with people. Lots of things you know you should be doing, but aren't. It isn't quite as manipulative as the title suggests, but has lots of great little historical feature-type stories inside as it seeks to prove the point of loving other people and treating others as you like to be treated. It's one of those books that should hit your read and re-read shelf of life. "
1202,Ed,One of the best business advices I have read
1203,Scot Maitland,Great book - still relevant. A little hokey at times but the information is still solid.
1204,Sara Murphy,"Dale Carnegie writes with a rare enthusiasm and affection for people in general. He offers common sense advice about situations we encounter everyday. This book is highly recommended for anyone who wants a greater sense of how to approach difficult(or to prevent) situations in business, in the home or in solving any dilemma we may encounter with another person. It was a quick read and it was pleasant as well. I look forward to rereading it. "
1205,Wadi Bardawil,Great Classic worth every page
1206,Chanika,"Awesome book on how to get more out of life, work and friends. Great for goalsetting, career development and management."
1207,Greg,Provides timeless tips on how to be more civil towards others and be more effective. 
1208,Bushra,"If any book has changed my belief after 'Alchemist' and 'The Secret,' it's Dale Carnegie's best seller 'How to win friends and influence people."
1209,Marc Brodeur,"Amazing and timeless. very fun to read, and an instructive guide to...basically being a good likeable person. "
1210,Hellacrickets,everyone needs to read this twice.
1211,Kacper,I'm preparing for a job interview tomorrow. This is a great book!
1212,Phelicia,"Criticism is futile, enough said."
1213,Ankit Dikshit,"The book focuses majorly on two points ways to make human relations better and introduction about leadership skills. As the first edition of the book was written in 1936 and it should be considered as the mother of all self improvement books. Dale Carnegie himself said that he has not written anything new, he was inspired by the ideas of Socrates, Jesus, and different Presidents in US history. Dale has shared experiences from day to day lives of him and his students to get the concepts better understood.A must read for everybody, not just once but again and again during different phases of life. This book can be read to refresh your human relation skills time to time. Five stars. *****"
1214,Emilie Thiffault,"Le titre peu sembler enfantin, mais non! Ce livre s'adresse à tout le monde. Il donne beaucoup de conseils concret pour la vie de tous les jours sur un paquet de sujet au niveau des relations humaines. Je le recommande fortement!"
1215,Giray Batıtürk,so so good.
1216,Boualem Magramane,I have read most of Dale Carnegie books but i found this book very helpful to improve my life and really win friends
1217,Nils Bergeson,"Absolutely priceless knowledge. If you haven't read it, you need to."
1218,Robin Yaklin,"It's been around for years and it's still good advice, especially if you want to stand out."
1219,英三 岡本,"人を動かす,D・カーネギー,創元社,1982"
1220,Kristen,Everyone should have to read this book. 
1221,Loiue Hanna,How to Win Friends and Influence People
1222,Andy Stehr,"This sounds lame, but this book changed my life."
1223,Justin,Read multiple times. Continue to take it off the shelf from time to time and reassess how I'm treating other people
1224,Priyanka,I just loved this book. Easy ways to succeed in life. Please read this book if you get a chance.
1225,Satyam Twanabasu,"I read this book right after my graduation! It was quite easy and enjoying reading! But when I read some part of it, it seemed quite guffy! Anyway, its one of the widely read self-help book that I can recommend to any early reader and I am sure that they won't be regretted!"
1226,Brad Mills,I try to listen to this audiobook at least once every couple of years. 
1227,Helene Pilibosian,"I read this book many years ago out of self-doubt. The ideas in it were wonderfully positive, both for the individual and for one seeking a job. I was interested in the first and learned about positive thinking and acting, about reversing the withdrawn personality etc. Trying to put these into practice was difficult and took years. But gradually and with some help it was possible. The book is excellent for its type, and I recommend it."
1228,Mohit,"initially thought it was tacky to read such a book, but i took warren buffet's advice and did so. one of the nicest books I've ever read, really digs in to fundamental behaviour of people. really enjoyed it and really helps you to effectively understand people and deal with them much better."
1229,Fernando Suarezserna,"I read it again after almost 10 years since the first time. Great book on persuasion and negotiation. There are no new fundamentals, I would totally recommend this book to anyone interested in getting better in making deals happen."
1230,Martin Asenov,A great book I regret not having read some ages ago :)
1231,Jennispeed,Everyone should read this book!
1232,Jose L. Caballero,"Por un lado están los libros de ""autoayuda"" y por otro está Dale Carnegie. Es la Biblia de las relaciones humanas.Y hay dos opciones: leerlo a toda velocidad y no sacar absolutamente nada o verdaderamente reflexionar y estudiarlo con detenimiento. En apariencia es un libro casi infantil, la realidad es que es un libro complejísimo y que requiere un esfuerzo activo para sacarle verdaderamente provecho.Leyendo a Carnegie te sobran el 99% de los llamados libros de ""autoyuda"" (digamos que así llaman ahora a cualquier cosa que trata sobre las relaciones humanas, emociones, etc). De hecho, la inmensa mayoría no dejan der ser intentos de copia de obras que como ésta se escribieron hace la tira de años."
1233,Stephen Leung,great read for interpersonal communications
1234,Kalvin Lam,Hmmm - just some thoughts to myself-a lot of cool insight from this book-I think it's important to realize that humans are things to be tricked/manipulated but rather it's kinda beautiful how we interact with one another and this book should be viewed as a way of enhancing our interactions-really applicable things for life
1235,nichiseven,"I was handed this book as a child and it's one I would highly recommend to anyone old enough to understand the concepts outlined in it's chapters. The decades have proven to me that this book is as relevant and applicable now as it was then and core values never change. Read it. If you understand it, you won't regret it."
1236,Julie,"Good useful book. Even though this book is pretty old in content and quotes, he still knows people. "
1237,Roslyn Telusma,"I read this book when I did timeshare sales, which was more than nine years ago, but even up to this day i am still finding it's techniques very useful in meeting people outside of trying to sell an item. Two of the things I still try to remember to do, is to call people by their names, because people like hearing their names called, it gives them a sense of importance, and they also like genuine compliments. If you are marketing anything at all, or would just like to hit it off immediately when you meet some one, this book will be a good one to read."
1238,Rich,An excellent source of ideas for those who want to be successful in business and life in general.
1239,Carlos DaSilva,Amazing! All teens should read as it will have an impact in the rest of their lives. Read ASAP!
1240,Tasneem,من افضل الكتب التي تتكلم عن تحسين الذكاء الأجتماعي فاق كل الكتب التي قرأتها سابقا
1241,hyp3rkyd,This book could change your life and how the world sees you. I am definitely going to read this for a second time. 
1242,Kimberly,"This is one ofthose rare books I have read multiple times. It is a great refresher, especially when work gets stressful and you need to turn things around."
1243,Jessica Sorensen,"Absolutely love this book! It taught me so much more the second time through! I definitely recommend to all. Knowing how to relate and deal with people with love and confidence that you are relatable to that person is so important! And this book has so much truth. Don't only read, put into action the principles and see people light up when you are around. "
1244,Markham,Excellent book. I need to read it again.
1245,Pamela Fox,Great read for anyone who works with people - i.e. everyone.
1246,Hannah,Genius book. Definitely up there on the must-read business books. 
1247,"Debbie ""DJ"" Wilson","Read this one quite awhile ago, but was reminded of it again. Don't let the title fool you, this is actually a very spiritual book. I loved it!"
1248,Kim,"A must read for understanding and dealing with people. Really, an outstanding book."
1249,Maryn Edgmon,Timeless! I hadn't read this book since high school. All I remember was that it was impactful and it didn't disappoint this time around. Everyone needs to read this one.
1250,Deb Clawson,This will be a yearly read for me. Everyone could use his advice! Love it!
1251,Aram,"This book is a practical, it contains the techniques and principles necessary to develop and sharpen your people skills. When I first read the title I thought only people without friends would want to read it…not the case, very powerful concepts, this book should be read by everybody! "
1252,Calynn,Must read for all humans who interact with other humans.
1253,Nhu Luong,"The best self-help book that can apply to our ordinary life. In the book, How to Win Friends and Influence People , Dale Carnegie persuasively provided the readers more effective communication skills that most people don't know about. This book is well-written and credible due to enormous sources of citations and researches that was put into. Dale Carnegie, a successful coach in many aspects of professional work and leadership development, is one of the most thoughtful and competent communicator and writer I had ever knew. I had some opportunities to try his methods of developing relationships and it worked like magic. Therefore, I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to improve their communication skills and leadership management. Embrace the book and learn from it ~ "
1254,M,This is one of my favorites. I reread it often and its perspective is great. Very cheerful and effective.
1255,Adolfo Salas,"El libro es básico para cualquier ser humano, te habla de una mejoría en tu persona y te menciona personajes trascendentales que han logrado dejar una huella en cuanto a las relaciones humanas, esto ejemplificado, con reglas practicas, hacen que tu vida sea más cortes y más humana. Un libro que debes leer puesto que cualquier libro que te invite a mejorar como persona siempre debe tener algún efecto positivo en ti."
1256,Hosam Elshambly,بجد كتاب جميل جدا وتوجد به كثير من النصائح التي تساعد في التعامل مع الناس والاهم فهم ما يحتاجه الاخر أثناء الحديث وكيفية تلبية احتياجه وكيفية توصيل الفكرة الي الغيرة باسلوب شيق ومقبول
1257,Luda,"ספר מדהים. בר מזל מי שקרא אותו בגיל צעיר ויכל להעצב על פיו, אך זה ספר מעולה לכל הגילאים ואני בטוחה שאחזור אליו שוב"
1258,Akhil,Quite a book . Most of the content is brilliant and you start using on the people around you to check if it really works. You find that it surely does.
1259,Slow Man,A short cut to distinction with APPLICATION.
1260,Dennis Clause,This is a must read. At least for me. I love the simple and easy to understand idea. Do on to others. 
1261,Peteh65,I have probably read this book over 100 times since getting it my senior year in highschool. 
1262,Nathanael Kanyinga,"One of the books a young adult should read, especially if he or she is going to be a people's person "
1263,Kellyann,"This is a book to stew on. Rather than reading straight through, i kept it in my work bag and read a chapter or two on the bus every morning. This steady influx of reinforcement set my perspective for the day, which resulted in a lot more good days. While none of his points are rocket science, their simplicity is deceptive and implementation isn't always easy nor do they come natural to me. I'll be re-reading this book on a regular basis."
1264,Karla,A must read! I've read this several times as well. 
1265,Dolores,"A book I've heard about for years and assumed it had something to do with manipulating people so was negative to read it! My 19 year old son bought it on audio and persuaded me to listen to it!! I was inspired to find it all about the golden rule, putting others first and never humiliating or putting others down! Great read or audio! "
1266,Xin,Classic book. The stories are somewhat too outdated though - I just don't feel connected to the people and stories of 1920s or 30s. 
1267,Sally Chu,"Great work about building social skills and behaving in various situation! I learned tons and gained confidence, hope to have chance to reread the book!"
1268,C.J.,"Every person should make this book a part of their life's curriculum. It is widely considered the bible of human behavior and is a must-read for everyone.Although it was written in the 1930s, Carnegie's philosophies still hold true. Timeless. Don't borrow it, buy it. You'll be a much better person for having read this book-- not only to yourself but for everyone around you."
1269,Chester Hong,The six ways to make people like you The twelve ways to win people to your way of thinking The nine ways to change people without arousing resentment...enough said lol!
1270,Maurice Hons,One of the best self help book out there. One of must have book
1271,JC,"I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did. The author broke down his points very concisely amd with obvious knowledge. The stories told did the job of explaining why his points on getting along with others work, quite well. A lot of them are quite common sense, but to take as a whole, I see people and my interaction with them differently. If you are wanting to be better at interaction with others, both in business and relationships elsewhere, read this book and apply his principles."
1272,Yohanna Rizk,"very useful stuff. some minor inconsistencies, as well as troubling implications. "
1273,Damien Franco,"This is such a classic. While most of the examples may seem dated the ideas and the lessons are not. In fact, given our current fast paced digital world, this book may be of more importance now than in any other time in history.If it's been a while since you've read it, or if you've never read it, I highly recommend giving it a read."
1274,Jo,This was required reading for my Junior Achievment team in HS. I never regreted it.
1275,Luis Fernando Franco,"Que buen libro, conciso, lleno de ejemplos de y para la vida real, nada nuevo de hecho, mucho sentido común, pero también mucha sensibilidad (que también es lo que nos falta muchas veces).No soy mucho de leer estos libros clasificados como ""autoayuda"", con ideas de ""el cambio está en ti mismo"", ""la ley de la atracción"", etc., por lo que no sabía que esperar con este. Lo que encontré es básicamente mucha responsabilidad y lo más importante, técnicas que se separan de la manipulación tan solo por la intención honesta de los actos.Creo que es un libro del cual tendré que leer al menos un capítulo cada semana de aquí hasta que logre asimilar y hacer míos estos conceptos, o me muera (cosa que probablemente ocurra primero)De verdad, debería ser libro de texto en las preparatorias y universidades, tendríamos un mejor mundo."
1276,Natasha,Nothing new but great reminders and well told through stories! Glad I finally got to read this classic!
1277,Michelle,Everyone should read this at least once!
1278,Heather ,classic. first heard about this book by overhearing a conversation at a country club.
1279,SJ Barakony,I re-read the books on the 'top 5' shelf every single year. The September completion was the 3rd time I had gone through it cover to cover. 
1280,Omar Zambrano,"Un libro tan elocuente y tan simple, si, simple(y no por eso deja ser excelente) .. Lo instruido no es secreto de estado, es más, es una serie de evidencias para lograr ser una excelente persona, y adicional, inculcarlo en los demás. Las rutinas cotidianas de la vida enmarcan tantos principios, que sin el conocimiento adecuado, nos alejan de nuestros objetivos. Esos objetivos son resumidos en reglas que estoy seguro auguran excelentes resultados. El ser humano se hace rodeado de personas, y ese tacto de relacionarse con las personas es la clave de cualquier éxito!"
1281,Crystal,"This book is very useful for becoming a better negotiator and even a better person in general. I plan on rereading this book just to make sure I picked up on everything. I am interested in social psychology, and this is one of the best books on the subject that I've ever read. "
1282,Ahmad أحمَد,You have to read this book .. Really Amazing! :D
1283,نجلاء العريفي,سبب تمام التقييم ريادة الكتاب في مجاله. كتب قبل أكثر من ٧٠ سنة.صحيح أغلب ما فيه بديهي للقارئ، ولكن قلما يطبق. الأمثلة رائعة. كتاب فاهم نفسية القارئ.
1284,Una Tiers,This was a re-read. I'd forgotten it was about positive thinking and all the benefits it has.
1285,Ashleigh Yates,"Love this book, so informational and motivating."
1286,Lukáš Rolf,"Doporučuji všem, kteří si přejí efektivně vyjadřovat svoje názory a znát mechanismy jednání s lidmi. Prozatím nejlepší a nejzajímavější kniha z těch, které jsem četl.""Když uvážíme, že celý náš život, veškeré naše snažení je vždy bezprostředním či zprostředkovaným jednáním s lidmi, úspěch při jednání s lidmi je úspěchem úspěchů"" - David Gruber, 1992"
1287,J. Hopkin,"We all hear about books that should be taught in schools, well this is truly one of them. If we all were a bit more thoughtful and respectful to others, not only would it make the world a better place, but our own lives would be that much more fulfilling. The values it teaches are priceless and are far more valuable today, than when the book was written. When I first came across this book, it was presented as a sales person book, however, I would like to view it more as a character building book for all people."
1288,Andrew Hansen,"Some of the concepts seem straight forward but their application is life changing. Carnegie has such a natural tone in his writing. It feels like having a conversation with him. Even 70+ year seperated from the original publication, the lessons in this book are extremely applicable to business and personal applications."
1289,Salma,"من امتع الكتب التى قراتها فى حياتى كنت اذهب لقرائته بين الفينة والاخرى متلهفة ,, تعلمت منه الكثير وتاثرت به حقا ,,فى تقديرى ممتع الى ابد حد ومفيد وسلس للغاية "
1290,Farhad,"This is a fantastic book. Many of the ideas put forth seem so obvious once you read them. You'll have probably heard similar words before but you'll find that rarely do you put them all into practice. Although his (sometimes unusual) examples are selected carefully to prove his points, Carnegie does a great job compiling and organizing practices that should be made second nature for those looking to enhance personal and professional relationships. The ideas are all so simple, yet so powerful, and can be implemented by anyone with a genuine interest in other people. It is not a book on theory, trickery, or insincere seduction, but rather a practical book on good manners and recognizing or appreciating others. I will continue to review this from from time to time with the intention of truly embedding a significant portion of his principles into my character, without having to consciously think about it. The beauty of this book is that each idea can be implemented immediately and the results are visible just as quick. Highly recommended."
1291,Jeff Lenhart,"Great book, written over 70 years ago and the same principles still apply today!!"
1292,Corky LaVallee,Should be required reading to graduate from high school!
1293,Challa Fletcher,"I actually liked this book. I checked out from the library but I will def buy my own copy and read it again. Most books like these are so stuffy you have to force yourself to read it. This was not the case with this book. The chapters aren't too long so you can get a little bit in each day, even on a busy schedule. This book has been in publication for quite some time but the techniques and skills are still very much relevant, needed and works. I recommend this book!"
1294,Franck,"To be loved, you must love first. To be considered, you must consider first. To be respected, guess what, you must respect first. When you recieve, never forget. When you give, never remember. "
1295,Charles Desouza,Probably the most important book you MUST read if you want to start your own business
1296,Atul Nagi,All go to book every year
1297,Spyros,"I found this book in my school library, and ever since I read it, Dale Carnegie became my favourite author!This book literally helped me resolve situations which appeared helplessly complicated!It helps you influence people not by rhetorically tricking them, but by employing the best aspects of your character in order to build rapport with the others.Surely recommend it!"
1298,Mohamed abdulkadir,life changing book...
1299,Ben Silver,Should be required reading for every student in the 6th grade! Full of useful advice and insight.
1300,Chad Williams,Opens your mind to how to better work with people and understand where they are coming from!
1301,Maureen McLaughlin,"His methods really do work. This is a great read. As you read it, think about how you talk to people and how you can change some of your relationships. "
1302,Esma Gulmez,It gives real examples about how to behave people and lead them.
1303,Chance Smith,This will be one I read again for notes. Loved it!
1304,Js Park,A very nice read there. Gonna read it again sometimes to re-learn and re-live the insights. :D
1305,Terri,"This book sat in my parents bookshelf for all the years I was growing up. My dad may have read it, as he was a master at business relationships. Recently it came to my attention again in an interview with Warren Buffet, who said it was one of the most important books he ever read. He said that he takes this book with him every where he goes and re-reads it often. Written in 1936 it's still completely applicable today - one of the most effective tools for managing relationships. It's an easy read and everyone should read it. "
1306,Madeiny,"Speechless... I have so many phrases from this book in my memory that it seems like I printed them there, it´s a WONDERFUL book, I only can say that, 100% Recommended!"
1307,Snezanelle,My first book in business psychology.
1308,Sonia Kantak,"Dale Carnegie's book is the perfect example of what timeless advice truly looks like. Though first published in 1936, his advice on how to foster positive relationships both in business and in our personal lives still rings true today. Make whoever you come across feel important--such a simple concept that is so often ignored in our daily lives. This book is well written with a plethora of examples. If you can acknowledge that Carnegie's advice will not work in all situations this can be incredibly transformative in the majority of your interactions. This is not a book of magic tricks or short cuts. It is a book on human relationships. This is definitely worth reading multiple times as a constant reminder to acknowledge those around us. "
1309,Terry,"a classic through and through. wish i had read this thing 15 years ago. friends, relationships, colleagues - i'm sorry I just got to this one! "
1310,Adnan Falak,Excellent book for improving social skills
1311,Erin O'Roark,"A book that everyone growing in a generation that's all about ""me"" should read.You'd think learning to be quiet and actively listen to people, learn about them, and be excited about their life would prove to be a difficult experience. But Carnegie weaves this how-to into an elegant and fun read.I've always been a person who was interested in others and thought I knew how to make friends. This book humbled me and made me see how I could change. As a result, I have loyal people in my life like I never have before. Highly recommended for anybody."
1312,A.D. Rutter,"Despite this book being 70 years old, it is not at all anachronistic. The principles Carnegie teaches are the same today as they were yesterday. It could be argued that more than ever we need to learn them today as society is forgetting how to just talk to each other. Other reviewers say this is only useful to sales people. If so, then we all need to read this book because we are all constantly selling our selves to those around us. Great, easy and short read."
1313,Abhijeet Lele,Fantatstic work with lots of examples
1314,Harry K,"The author died at least 50 years ago. The society, world has changed so much since. So one may feel this book not informative enough.But some rules of this book are timeless. Read it not to miss a Classic."
1315,Dani,As long as people inhabit the Earth this book will be relevant. 
1316,Jason,The BEST book about communication I've ever read. I apply the things I've learned to this DAILY.
1317,Hari,"One of my first self help books that I happened to read by chance, and this is primarily the reason why I started reading a lot of books.Well worth the money, This also happens to be my most favourite book to give as a gift."
1318,Malleswari,"Making good relationships with the people around us makes a healthy and friendly environment to work with or to stay with. This book tells us the way to make that happen. Its all about the way we to talk to others, and treat them. The principles Dale Carnegie describes in this book, truly helps to improve the way we act in a particular situation. Appreciation, Encouragement, Having smile always on face and more are the strong tools to build the better relationship with people. I strongly recommend everyone to read this book. Thank you."
1319,Steve,I wish I had read this book when I was younger. I would have learned how to get along with people and bring them around to my perspective instead of arguing with them.
1320,Todd,This book was included in my book: The 100 Best Business Books of All Time. www.100bestbiz.com
1321,Luis Barcelo,A must read book for anyone desiring to succeed in life.
1322,Mohammed H,"What a great book! Simple ideas yet make a massive difference. There is a part in this book called father forgets, its probably one of the most influential parts of this book! Well at least for me. If you have argumentative friends you most definitely want to recommend this book for them. I am surprised it was written a long time ago!! Good advice never perish.. "
1323,Robert Anderson,"Amazing read! Filled with stories of people, from all walks of life, gaining confidence in themselves and achieving what they never thought possible."
1324,Margie,This was one of my favorite books. He has a positive attitude. I used to go to the bookstore and found him in there so I always looked for his books.

1326,Aurimas Mikalauskas,A must read for people like me :)
1327,Meagan Latimer,An amazing book that has completely changed the way I interact with people since I first read it years ago. I think he recommends that people read it at least once a year which I think it good advice... and which I have not done. It's definitely one worth revisiting.
1328,Ken Parsell,"Though written nearly a century ago, this book still rings true. Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" deals primarily with basic human nature and how most of us share the same basic sentiments in how we would prefer to be treated. It is not a book about high platitudes or ideas, but rather a basic ""how-to"" approach to interacting with people on a personal and professional level. I was put off by the title at first, but after reading it, admit that it was nothing I had initially expected it to be."
1329,Jayson,"One of best books I have ever read. I learned a lot from this book. I highly recommend it. Actually, this book should be required reading.The only negative thought I have about the book is sometimes it feels like he tells to many stories to get his point across. "
1330,Daniel Lakstins,Awesome book written in a very unique style
1331,C-Nat,"I actually read this books years ago and decided to pick it up and read it again, this time taking notes on notecards and keeping them nearby so that I will have a daily reminder of how to better myself and to pay attention to the needs of others. "
1332,Mariana,my father bought this book for me when i was 17..and i think this is one of the greatest gift he ever gave me.perfect book in the perfect age. 
1333,Jihwan Yun,"must read for a life at once. It has full of humanity ideas and motivates you to behave nicely to people and friends. I can't find any helpful self-help books than this. The suggestion in this book is very simple and cliche, but very important and fundamental to our relationships."
1334,Sara Scheuermann,Great! Would re-read multiple times and get as presents for my Dad and boss!
1335,Amanda,I loved this book. He has great information that I think everyone can relate to. 
1336,Macy,classic self-improvement book - you will learn how to be likeable and improve professional as well as personal relationships. The examples/stories are somewhat outdated but the points remain up to date.

1338,Katie Q,I have started this book many times. It is great but when it stops talking to me I stop reading it. I will turn to this book many times in my life and so will you.

This is among my all time top five books.I have given this book to a number of people as a gift as they were moving into leadership positions and such.Truely, one of the best pieces ever written. read a few pages every day if you can."
1352,Chris Leach,"Outdated and cliched by now, though not without merit. I gave it five stars because it completely changed some of the important relationships in my life. Primarily, it showed me that I was not listening very well and that the prejudices that resulted were hampering my enjoyment of the people I cared about. I recommend it for anyone who thinks they might improve the way they communicate."

1356,Patrick Budd,"I don't think this book needs another review... It's probably one of the best books you could possibly read if you are in any sort of career that deals with people on a regular basis. I work in sales and found it extremely helpful, and most of all, practical. Literally every principle can be applied almost immediately."

1358,Razvan Fecico,This migth be the most important book I've read.Everyone should read this amazing book!Seriously!!!
1359,Sean Bean,"Simple, unadulterated advice that has been stretched out and sullied by the overload of self help books out there. Dale Carnegie gives excellent pointers that may seem hard to follow (basically, swallow your ego!) If everyone, or at least more of us listened, the world would certainly be an easier place."
1360,Tim,A timeless work! This will be in my regular rotation for years to come.
1361,Tanya,Loved it. Reminds you of the basic principles of humanity. And of being liked. Sometimes these principles need a refresher course. 
1362,Jonas Dralle,I love itI'll definitely read it again in some months
1363,Chrissy Wissler,"If you're a manager, supervisor, or in a position where you deal with people - read this book. You will learn so much, including suggestions on getting people to do what they're told and how to make them want to do it. As a manger, this book has helped me tremendously. Everyday I'm pulling something from it and using his principles in the office."

1365,Tia,"I understand why this book is still popular after so many years. It goes over the basic realities about interacting with other people in such a straightforward, honest and applicable way! True, the writing style is somewhat old fashion and made me laugh a little, but the principles the book teaches are timeless. It's one I'd like to re-read every couple years to refresh myself and hopefully keep working towards improving the way I interact with others."
1366,Henry Manampiring,"I have always been cynical about self-help or motivational genre. I have known about this book for a long time and always stayed away from it. One day I read that the legendary investor Warren Buffett said this book changed his life. Now I have a lot of respect for Buffett. If he said it's good, it's worth giving a shot. My prejudice was proven wrong. This book can NOT be grouped together with nonsense like The Secret. Here is a practical book based on observed human behavior and commkn sense. It does not promise you miraculous success in life. It just gives us tips on how to RELATE to others better. And that, for a lot of people, is enough. Simply a must read for anyone who is interested in improving their social lives."
1367,Haytham Badawey,"THIS BOOK CHANGED MY SOCIAL LIFE.

1368,Sweetsell,"How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie is a phenomenal self-help book, set in the thirties, which sold more than 15,000,000 copies around the world and was first published in 1937. A revised edition of the book was released in 1981.The book’s sole purpose is to help people solve the biggest problems they face: the problem of getting along with and influencing people in their everyday, business and social contacts. The content of the book is told through and based on the personal experiences of the author himself and of his students from his courses in Effective Speaking and Human Relations. It focuses primarily on the do’s and don’ts in interacting with people, and emphasizes the things that should be remembered when a certain “undesirable” situation arises.I truly enjoyed reading How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie because of how useful and helpful it is when it comes to dealing with people. The points were made out clearly and the author wrote it with all love and sincerity. There’s nothing fake or unreal about it. Trying to follow all the principles pointed out in the book can be very challenging, because human as we are, we all have flaws, but the simple fact that you tried to follow the fundamental rules in dealing with people in your own sincere little way gives not only great joy but also great satisfaction. While it is a human story, it is told so that all humans will understand it and relate to it.If you are like me and love to read books to help improve oneself in a very positive way, you will love How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. This book is a very precious piece of literature and will surely bring out the best in you if you try to absorb its message by heart. I whole-heartedly recommend this book not only to those who are struggling to have better human relations, but also to people who would love to know the secret of winning friends and dealing with people."
1369,Kiriko,Instantly helpful. #personaldevelopment
1370,La pointe de la sauce," There's magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: ""I may be wrong.I frequently am. Let's examine the facts."" Ha! Loved the book. Manny, read it!"
1371,Luke,"Finally read it...and will read again, many times, in my life"
1372,Jordan ,Eye openerI recently begun studying more about human relations and self development this year as a resolution and this book has by far been my favorite read. Dave Carnegie broadened the ways I view running a business as well as dealing with people. The book provided an ample amount of examples that put the way I viewed human relations into a better more clear perspective. This is definitely something that I'm going to re-read every year. 
1373,John Smolen,"Really easy fun read, really applicable for any business person."
1374,Venessa Martens,This is one of the best self help books I've read. This guy knows what he's talking about and delivers his information on a very comprehensive and readable way. I loved the real life stories he used to illustrate the principles in the book. Great read. Very effective.
1375,Maitha S 240521,"This book is amazing. It describes how could you build your new relationships and make friends easily and quickly. It also gives advises of how you could influence others and win them over to your way of thinking. The book gives some advises that could help you to improve your conversation skills and makes you more entertaining. I recommend this book for everyone because it could be used as guide to successful life. The principles of this book could be use in the social and professional level, which will leads to success in both of them.This book is well written and provided with good example that makes you understand the ideas of each principle.

1380,Fabian,"I have read many books in the personal development field and I can say without doubt that this book has altered the way I think in very a positive way.Most of the points in this book should be common sense but the way that everything is explained and bought to your attention really caught my eye. Without even thinking, I apply these principles everyday now and I have become a better person for it.I would highly recommend this book to everyone, no matter what field you work in or where you live!"

1383,Julianne Delvina,A timeless classic with great advice for dealing with people. 
1384,Cameo,"This book was awesome!! It just has so many good ideas that all make sense. Most of his ideas aren't new concepts, but I love all the anecdotes that put the concepts into real life perspectives. I want to re-read this book over and over and use these principles with my kids and family especially!"
1385,Andrea Liu,"This is an important work in which I can see why it has been a huge bestseller for 80 years. The advice is so practical and clear, you wonder why there are so few people with these great skills. A successful person can apply these ideas likely without trying. The rest of us can learn from the wisdom of the many great people quoted here, Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Charles Schwab, Ben Franklin. You can read this and be an improved human the next day.The advice is presented as a series of principles to follow, accompanied by many anecdotes that show how well these techniques work, from famous figures and everyday Americans, collected from Dale Carnegie’s classes.I'm tempted to make a PowerPoint slideshow to make sure I've internalized all the valuable information imparted by Mr. Carnegie."
1386,Beatrice Chang,Really solid advice. Still very applicable to our modern day society.

1400,Fatooma Aj,قبل قليل أنهيت كتاباً أعتبره أحد أروع الكتب التي قرأتها .. رغم أن كثيراً مما قاله الكاتب سمعته من قبل أو قرأت عنه .. لكن لا أعلم لم شعرت وكأنني أقرؤه لأول مرة .. لربما أسلوبه الرائع هو السبب.. ولربما حوجتي لكتاب كهذا يوقظني من غفلة كنت أتمرغ فيها لفترة طويلة .. أكثر ما أعجبني هو تحدث الكاتب عن أهمية أن يحب الانسان نفسه .. أن لا يسعى ليكون شخصية مقلدة من الآخرين .. لا يسعى لاسترضائهم بشتى الطرق .. فإن إن فعل سيجد نفسه متعباً ومرهقاً .. تعلم أن تتقبل الانتقاد . فوراء كل انتقاد لاذع حب داخلي أو مجاملة مبطنة .. إن أردت الانتقاد فتوقف أولاً .. ولا تحاول أن تظهر إنك على حق والطرف الآخر مخطئ فذلك لن يولد لديه إلا شعور بالرفض ورغبة في الدفاع عن نفسه ورأيه .. ابدأ بطريقة ودية .. أشعره أنك تهتم بما يريده أكثر من اهتمامك بما تريده أنت .. وكن صادقاً في ذلك .. وستجد نتائج رائعة .. امنح الثناء .. فكل انسان يحب أن يشعر بأهميته .. إن أشعرته بأهميته سيعطيك من وقته ومحبته الكثير .. وما أعجبني في هذا المقطع بالذات ذكر الكاتب لشخصيات تاريخية عظيمة قد لا نعتقد أنها تحتاج لاهتمام أو شعور بالثناء .. لكنها الفطرة الانسانية بغض النظر عن المكانة الاجتماعية ...:) باختصار .. افتح قلبك للناس ..

1402,Samantha,"This is an amazing book. I dislike that the title reads like a woo self-help book, but everything between the covers is golden. It provides a plethora of tips and strategies to effectively deal with people in a way that caters to human emotion over rational thought. I've tried out only a few of these ideas and noticed an immediate positive difference in the way people received me. I'm posting these principles up in my room so I don't forget them! "

1407,Christopher Luna,"Phenomenal book for any one who will be in a situation involving other people. Carnegie provides an easy, enjoyable source of social graces that will surely increase the charisma of any reader. The information presented is not manipulative, as some may assume from the title, but rather a series of concrete tips on easy philanthropy that makes a difference."

1411,Darcy,"I can see why this is such a classic. So much of it is common sense and how to deal with human beings, yet it still resonated with me. I really like the antidotes and stories of how these tools work. I plan to re-read this again, which I never do, just to be sure I remember all the tips. Definitely worth a place on my bookshelves. "
1412,Dave Hill,A couple small tweaks to the advice in this book and you have basically bought yourself an express ticket to Poontown.
1413,Brendan Barrett,""" Dale Carnegie is a well-researched author that supports his points in this timeless self-help book with sound reasoning and plenty of engaging stories. I recommend listening to the Andrew MacMillan-narrated version of the audio book. I will be reading and referencing this book again, possibly many times."
1414,BethAnne,When I read this book many times I felt like someone was punching me in the stomach. It made me realize I could be treating people better and I had a lot of improvements to make in my life.
1415,Billy,I highly recommend this book for those interested in bettering their leadership ability.
1416,Stephen- Craig,I read this book when I was 15 years old and it changed my life......It made me aware of people and what is important to them and to place their needs in front of my own.......Just re-read it and it is just as true and valid today as it was nearly 50 years ago ! ! ! 
1417,Aslam,"I understand that everyone will not agree with the ideas on this book, but for me it's an eye opener. In my opinion, probably the best book out there on persuasion and human behavioural psychology. "
1418,Jessica Metcalf,Every time I re-read this book I learn more life lessons. This book relates to all types of people and spans across time with its universal knowledge of how to work and live with others.
1419,Rculliford,"This book was AMAZING! I would recommend it to everyone. From the title of the book I wasn't sure what to expect. The book takes the wonderful approach of sincerity. With each lesson he makes sure to stress the fact that the points will only work if they are sincere. The whole point of the book is to behave in such a way that the other person feels important and valued, while still getting the task at hand done. It is about lifting others to reach their full potential. I loved the fact that in most of the examples the job got done, but the person in charge was not the only one who was satisfied with the job well done. I'm terrible at writing reviews, but of all the books I've read recently this one is probably the absolute BEST!"
1420,Sean Rosenthal,"Interesting Quotes:""Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain - and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.""-Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People---------------------------------""The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simply. One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned.""-Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People-----------------------------------""At one time I rented the grand ballroom of a certain New York hotel for twenty nights in each season in order to hold a series of lectures. ""At the beginning of one season, I was suddenly informed that I should have to pay almost three times as much rent as formerly. This news reached me after the tickets had been printed and distributed and all announcements had been made. ""Naturally, I didn't want to pay the increase, but what was the use of talking to the hotel about what I wanted? They were interested only in what they wanted. So a couple of days later I went to see the manager."" 'I was a bit shocked when I got your letter,' I said, 'but I don't blame you at all. If I had been in your position, I should probably have written a similar letter myself. Your duty as the manager of the hotel is to make all the profit possible. If you don't do that, you will be fired and you ought to be fired. Now, let's take a piece of paper and write down the advantages and the disadvantages that will accrue to you, if you insist on this increase in rent.' ""Then I took a letterhead and ran a line through the center and headed one column 'Advantages' and the other column 'Disadvantages.' ""I wrote down under the head 'Advantages' these words: 'Ballroom free.' Then I went on to say: 'You will have the advantage of having the ballroom free to rent for dances and conventions. That is a big advantage, for affairs like that will pay you much more than you can get for a series of lectures. If I tie your ballroom up for twenty nights during the course of the season, it is sure to mean a loss of some very profitable business to you.'"" 'Now, let's consider the disadvantages. First, instead of increasing your income from me, you are going to decrease it. In fact, you are going to wipe it out because I cannot pay the rent you are asking. I shall be forced to hold these lectures at some other place. "" 'There's another disadvantage to you also. These lectures attract crowds of educated and cultured people to your hotel. That is good advertising for you, isn't it? In fact, if you spent five thousand dollars advertising in the newspapers, you couldn't bring as many people to look at your hotel as I can bring by these lectures. That is worth a lot to a hotel, isn't it?""""As I talked, I wrote these two 'disadvantages' under the proper heading, and handed the sheet of paper to the manager, saying: 'I wish you would carefully consider both the advantages and disadvantages that are going to accrue to you and then give me your final decision.'""I received a letter the next day, informing me that my rent would be increased only 50 percent instead of 300 percent. ""Mind you, I got this reduction without saying a word about what I wanted. I talked all the time about what the other person wanted and how he could get it.""Suppose I had done the human, natural thing; suppose I had stormed into his office and said, 'What do you mean by raising my rent three hundred percent when you know the tickets have been printed and the announcements made? Three hundred percent! Ridiculous! Absurd! I won't pay it!'""What would have happened then? An argument would have begun to steam and boil and sputter - and you know how arguments end. Even if I had convinced him that he was wrong, his pride would have made it difficult for him to back down and give in.""Here is one of the best bits of advice ever given about the fine art of human relationships. 'If there is any one secret of success,' said Henry Ford, 'it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.' -Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People---------------------------------------------------""You don't feel like smiling? Then what? Two things. First, force yourself to smile. If you are alone, force yourself to whistle or hum a tunr or sing. Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to make you happy . . . ""Everybody in the world is seeking happiness - and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.""-Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People----------------------------------------------------""So if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments. ""Remember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems. A person's toothache means more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million people. A boil on one's neck interests one more than forty earthquakes in Africa. Think of that the next time you start a conversation.""-Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People-----------------------------------------Bits & Pieces, published by The Economic Press, Fairfield, N.J.:""How to Keep a Disagreement from Becoming an Argument""http://www.turnedondigital.com/2011/h...-------------------------------------------------------""Years ago, when I was a barefoot boy walking through the woods to a country school out in northwest Missouri, I read a fable about the sun and the wind. They quarreled about which was the stronger, and the wind said, 'I'll prove I am. See the old man down there with a coat? I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you can.'""So the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until it was almost a tornado, but the harder it blew, the tighter the old man clutched his coat to him.""Finally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and then the sun came out from behind the clouds and smiled kindly on the old man. Presently, he mopped his brow and pulled off his coat. The sun then told the wind that gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force.""The use of gentleness and friendliness is demonstrated day after day by people who have learned that a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.""-Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People---------------------------------""Remember that other people may be totally wrong. But they don't think so. Don't condemn them. Any fool can do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do that.""There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret out that reason - and you have the key to his actions, perhaps to his personality.""-Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People----------------------------------""Wouldn't you like to have a magic phrase that would stop arguments, eliminate ill feeling, create good will, and make the other person listen attentively?""Yes? All right. Here it is: 'I don't blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.'""An answer like that will soften the most cantankerous old cuss alive. And you can say that and be 100 percent sincere, because if you were the other person you, of course, would feel just as he does . . .""Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.""-Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People----------------------------------------""I knew a man who had to refuse many invitations to speak, invitations extended by friends, invitations coming from people to whom he was obligated; and yet he did it so adroitly that the other person was at least contented with his refusal. How did he do it? Not by merely talking about the fact that he was too busy and too-this and too-that. No, after expressing his appreciation of the invitation and regretting his inability to accept it, he suggested a substitute speaker. In other words, he didn't give the other person any time to feel unhappy about the refusal, He immediately changed the other person's thoughts to some other speaker who could accept the invitation."" -Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People-------------------------------------------"
1421,Lwin Mar,Great Book
1422,Addela Garboos,This book was great! Easy to read and insightful.
1423,Eddie Runner,"this is a must read book for everyone.. I first read it decades ago, but I recently re-read and made my employees read it as well. It changed the moral of all my employees in a great way."
1424,Hind Pansuria,A must read for every avid readers. Favourite book of Warren buffett. The book will influence your life. guaranteed!
1425,melydia,"In general, I do not read self-help books. I find them preachy and uninspiring. This book, however, was highly recommended by a blogger whose post convinced me to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. Though the principles are probably common sense (motivate through praise rather than criticism, listen without interrupting, smile, make the other person feel important, etc.), I believe it did me some good to hear them all laid out in such a straightforward manner. Everybody else on the planet is just as self-absorbed as I am, and they care far more about what they want than what I want. Each chapter began with a principle, described it a little in general, then listed anecdote after anecdote about the principle in action. Most telling to me was the repeated assurance that these techniques only work if the feeling behind them in genuine, not manipulative. People can see through flattery.This book was first published in 1936, and we certainly have not become a more genteel society since then. I wonder what Carnegie would think of the internet and its trolls. For much of the book I could imagine people hearing the advice and thinking, ""Yes! This is how other people should treat me!"" But of course that's not the point. The point is that if you treat other people this way, you will benefit. Sometimes this will be through convincing people to come around to your way of thinking, but more often just by spreading good will. Had this book been written a few decades later, I'm sure karma would have been mentioned more than once.Though a couple of the techniques described might come off as passive-aggressive today, by and large it's a good resource - a good reminder for how to deal with other people, to give and receive criticism gracefully, and generally improve your attitude. I hereby recommend it to everyone on the planet. In return, I will attempt to practice its principles in my own life more often. I can't promise I'll always be successful - three decades of acerbity do not disappear overnight, after all - but I can try."
1426,Lex Alexander,"There's a reason that this book has sold millions of copies and is still in print after 75 years. Carnegie hits on fundamental aspects of human nature and how empathy will diffuse arguments and influence most people. By appealing to the other person's vanity and highest ideals, insinuating ideas, letting the other person do most of the talking, speaking in terms of the other person's interests, allowing the other to save face, by ""throwing down a challenge,"" etc., you can turn anyone into a friend or influence them to your way of thinking. I highly recommend this book."
1427,Joe Guerra,"Definitely a must read for everyone. It's crazy that the original version was written in 1936. The examples Dale gives is pretty detailed, from a letter that Lincoln never sent to one of his Generals to his own experiences from years of research. I'll be reading this again."
1428,Duyên Phạm,"Đọc cuốn sách khi nghe nhiều người bảo hay lắm, hay lắm, đọc đi. Đọc lúc đầu cũng thấy bình thường, cũng cưỡi ngựa xem hoa,vì đa phần những điều này mình đã từng trải nghiệm trong vài năm qua khi sống chung phòng với nhiều người ở kí túc xá. Đặc biệt tôi nhớ nhất là quy tắc đặt mình vào trong tình huống của người khác, cũng nhờ quy tắc này mà tôi nhìn sự việc ở một cấp độ khác, không còn phán xét phiến diện nữa, vì thế thái độ đối với mọi người cũng có vẻ cảm thông hơn. Đi mua vé tàu, phải chờ lâu mình nghĩ họ cũng cực chứ đâu sướng như mình đâu, thầy cô làm khó mình cũng có vẻ thông cảm và cố gắng hết sức, bạn phê phán một đứa cùng nhóm nhưng tôi vẫn cố bênh cho bằng được. Tuy nhiên mọi việc nên xuất phát từ sự chân thành, nó mới phát huy tác dụng.Trước khi đi học xa, gia đình đối với tôi chưa có ý nghĩa nhiều, đi xa mới biết nó quan trọng. Tôi rất ít khi thể hiện tình cảm với gia đình nên tôi chỉ đành gửi gắm qua thư và những món quà. Hồi năm trước đã từng dùng cách viết thư để khuyên nhủ ba, và nó đã có tác dụng, đôi lúc câu chữ lại lay động lòng người hơn. Qua thư cũng thể hiện tình cảm mà mình yêu thương không đủ dũng cảm để nóiHôm nay tôi đã nói ra suy nghĩ của mình với mợ, tỏ ra thông cảm với mợ, thật sự rất chân tình. Tôi cũng không quá khinh thường mợ như trước nữa vì tôi biết mỗi con người có một nỗi khổ khó nói, đôi lúc họ cũng bất đắc dĩ mà thôi, tình yêu thì đôi lúc hơi mù quáng. Mợ đã cảm ơn tôi, vậy là đủ rồi"
1429,Alex Einz,quite good
1430,Ridhwan Abdul,"Took me some times to complete the reading of this book due to heavy schedule. Worth reading, practical theory and helps me a lot understanding other people."
1431,Dharmesh Manglani,"A must read book to get acquainted with psychology behind convincing and persuasion. This book has taught me priceless lessons which have already started to pay-off in my relationships with family, friends, seniors and juniors. I encountered a great change in my attitude and interpersonal skills. I got to know some secrets behind human persuasion. A must read for future leaders or for those who want to effectively lead in one or the other areas of life. Author has structured the book in perfect way, covering principles related to dealing with people, make people like you, win people to your way of thinking, change people without offending them, and to make home life happier. "
1432,Andy,"I've read it twice now, and will likely read it again soon. "
1433,T Campbell,"One of those books that really can change your life and make you a better person, if you read it at the right time. I was a teenager when I finished it, and while I wouldn't say it cured my social awkwardness altogether, I was much more able to relate to people and understand conversations after finishing it. It gets my highest possible recommendation."
1434,Kevin Cook,"This is as essential reading as my Bible! I love this book, and I re-read it every year. If you wish to live out the golden rule, this book is a quality road map and pleasure to read."
1435,Carole,Fantastic--EVERYONE should read this!
1436,Sandheep Vurukkara,"This book clearly explains how you must behave with people and make them interested in you, and finally win them as your friends for life! "
1437,Vincent Boateng,"This book is filled with wisdom and practical techniques for dealing with everyday situations in your relations with people. After reading it, I feel like I can more easily get along with people, influence people and get them to do what I want (within reason) without a hassle. Dale Carnegie teaches in this book that to change people's attitudes and behaviors, begin with praise and honest appreciation; Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly; Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person; Ask questions instead of giving orders; etc. This is certainly a must-read for anyone who desires success in human relations."
1438,Frank,"Best book on the subject you will ever find. A read and reread throughout your life, a definite must for everyone!"
1439,Masrudin,Buku ini banyak menginspirasi cara manusia berhubungan dengan manusia lainya.
1440,Sara J.,Interesting book (more so in audiobook form - the novelty of which still hasn't worn off for me - haha). Great principles to follow although you probably should keep in mind to not end up being a doormat following said principles.. or a sycopant... or to sound over patronising. Lel. Positivity is always a good thing. Sometimes one negative comment from the wrong person... and one is unable to recover for life. Extreme. But possible.
1441,Clay Olsen,One of the best books I've ever read. Its advice is timeless and life changing. 
1442,Kendel Christensen,"Save the gospel itself, and my mission president, this book has been the single most influential thing in my life. Insightful? Yes. Timeless, Absolutely. But for someone who had no social skills to speak of until his mission? Transformative.Here are just a FEW of the nuggets in this amazing book:“Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.”(Emerson, As quoted by Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People, p. 31)“You will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will . . . inspire your opponent to be just as fair and open . . . as you are. It will make him want to admit that he, too, may be wrong.”(Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People, p. 125)“Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.“‘A great man shows his greatness,’ said Carlyle, ‘by the way he treats little men.’”“Criticisms are like homing pigeons. They always return home. Let’s realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and condemn us in return”“There is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to admit one's errors. It not only clears the air of guilt and defensiveness, but often helps solve the problem created by the error.”(Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People, p. 138)But my #1, favorite principle from this book is DEFINITELY: ‘If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.’ “That is so simple, so obvious . . . yet 90 percent of the people on this earth ignore it 90 percent of the time.”(Henry Ford, then Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People, p. 37)"
1443,Abner Huertas,Buen libro de superación personal..
1444,Thanh Ho,The book might fall out of fashion with some young readers. But it's recommended to give this book to them as soon as they can read text books. We need more books for making better living.
1445,Balimuse,Good book with a lot of useful thoughts.
1446,Henry Park,"I know, I know, I need the help... for those of you familiar, I'm sure you've read it and loved it. for those who aren't, this is a business classic. Carnegie goes over very common sense and practitical habits that all people should build. what i loved about it was the examples he gives; the extent some of the famous figures in history have used these habits are incredible. "
1447,Brady,"Definitely from the time period when the ""extrovert ideal"" was king (as discussed in ""Quiet"" by Susan Cain). However, there are some critical takeaways such as active listening and motivating that remain timeless. "

1460,Glenn,"Clearly deserving its classic status, Dale Carnegie's folksy wisdom rings true nearly 80 years after it was penned. Carnegie uses anecdotes and research alike to demonstrate the needs of human nature, emphasizing that an authentic interest in others (which is most people's number one priority and area of expertise!) is the best way to get along with and ingratiate yourself to others. Lesson upon lesson of selflessness and patience are excellent reminders as we polish our social skills with these intuitive truths."

1463,Catherine,"This book is a guide to life. I think several people should be required to read this book at least once. Teachers, emotional teenagers, employers, employees, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, friends, neighbors, politicians etc...I truly found this book oddly entertaining. Although it is a self-improvement type book, I couldn't put it down. Through the examples of many famous and successful people throughout history, this book teaches us how to work with others and be nice. I sincerely believed that my ability to effectively communicate and work with other people improved exponentially through reading this book and putting what I learned into action.I love this book and am going to require that my children read it before they get a job, a drivers' license, or a date.

A lot of the techniques Dale Carnegie talks about can be apply to an everyday relationship and what a difference it makes!!
1468,Jason Iyasara,"I first read “How to win friends and influence people” way back in January 2000. That’s nearly 15 years ago. It had a profound effect on me. Yes, it is a little old and there is more up to date advice on a few of the points in other books. But I've re-read it every couple of years as it contains imperative guidance for all sorts of situations – whether networking, selling or resolving conflicts. It changes your whole way of thinking. For the better!"
1469,M_moatassem,"Great Book, really inspiring and helpful. Offering a complete set of ready-to-apply advises and techniques. Old fashion writing style and classical real life examples make the book a little bit hard to follow, unless you skip some of the ""Story"" details, and directly jump to the conclusion or the advise offered by the author."
1470,Waseem,"Excellent book and now after reading it I see exactly why this is one of the all time best classics, these principles and skills are of much importance for any sane human being to help deal with society and people in a mututal beneficial manner without the crap we get!

1476,Jenny19910419,"I grow up in a very competitive environments and struggled along the way to achieve what I have accomplished now. Throughout the time, I am comparing myself with people around me, and try to prove that I am better than others in academic and other fields. I also like to share my moment of joy on social network to manifest that I am leading a good life. As a result, a lot of people stay away from me, since it seems like I am only concerned about myself, and do not pay attention to others, which is not true. After reading the book, I have been trying to control my self-esteem, and try to make other people feel that they are appreciated by me from the bottom of my heart. I am not outgoing person who would like express appreciation, but I will try my best from now on for both my families and people around me. I hope that in a few years, I can have more friends, and enjoy my life more with them."
1477,Marc,"I found this book on a bunch of ""must read books"" list, the first couple times I saw it didn't think much about it, but after A couple searches I decided there must be something to it. This book is like a text book for human interaction which as the book illustrated is the most important quality while going through life. I half expected this book to get really boring but for every lesson in the book that the writer gives several examples on historical figured that used the same practices in their lives all the time, like lincoln or other successful people.

1485,Skagz23,I loved this book! It's so simple yet so brilliant. I'm a naturally shy person and I thought this book could give me tips to make me feel more confident in social settings where I don't know anyone. I tried out some of his techniques at a party recently and I had no trouble making conversation with strangers. The advice in this book is really timeless. It was an eye-opening read and has given me a new way to think and interact with people. I highly recommend it!
1486,Sandra Simmons,"A classic whose message is appropriate for any century. If you can't interact effectively with people so they know, like and trust you, then it is difficult to do business in a world where your reputation, good or bad, can be discovered on the internet by millions. Good lessons in this book have stood the test of time."
1487,Michelle Reid,I wondered why I hadn't read this before! Made me think and look internally at how I deal with people.
1488,Katie Coates,This book is amazing. It's probably the only interesting nonfiction book I have ever read. Dale Carnegie's advice is supplemented by real-life stories that prove how caring about what other people want and creating a win-win situation can really work and can lead to success-- whether in business or just in everyday life.
1489,Jeff,Read it many years ago . . . Worked for me!
1490,Rachel Ong,"A must-read for everyone, at any stage of life. I will revisit this again and again. There is a reason why some books have yet to go out of print despite it being decades old. "
1491,Helena,Very useful!
1492,Nodefahad,i like the way the author talk about it i wanna finish this book ASAP 
1493,Blake Schreckhise,The first book that I read that showed me how people like to be treated. Excellent book and in fact I need to reread it! It's been too long.
1494,z,"full of anecdotes and not exactly a page-turner, but it speaks the truth about human nature and really makes a lot of sense. should try to condense it and put it into practice now!"
1495,Tiwik,"Ini adalah buku yang pertama kali menginspirasi saya untuk menjadi seseorang yang lebih baik, dan mendorong untuk selalu maju. Diperkenalkan oleh salah seorang teman. Dan dari buku ini saya mulai menjadi semakin rajin berkunjung ke toko buku untuk melihat dan mengoleksi buku-buku pengembangan diri."
1496,Luis Ignacio,"No soy un lector asiduo a este tipo de literatura, sin embargo me quise dar la oportunidad de leer lo que durante años me negué a aceptar como una posibilidad. Les soy sincero... tenia una idea equivocada de este libro... no es el tipico libro de pseudomotivación personal... es un libro realmente enfocado a darte conocimiento respecto al trato con la gente con la que te relacionas. Aunque fue escrito hace muchas decadas, este libro contiene información que sin importar el paso del tiempo permanece vigente. Un ""must read"" sin duda."
1497,Hamse,I hope I Will Find My Point!
1498,Muhammad Tayyab,It such a great book really helped me to make friends and even made keep them.
1499,Phil Simon,"Excellent and worth its weight in gold. Going to a technical school didn't exactly grace me with killer people skills. I only wish that I had read this book in high school, although I may not have appreciated it so much."
1500,Ayman,every human should read this book
1501,Caleb Philbrick,"A book to study, not skim. In taking it seriously, however, it hurt me to realize how poorly I have treated others without knowing it. "
1502,Sierra,"""Why 5 stars?"" you might ask. Knowing that I basically loathe self-help books. Considering that the book reads like someone summarizing really touching stories his cousins or acquaintances forwarded in an e-mail (""This really happened!! Forward to 10 people or you´ll burn in Hell 4ever. Thanx!"").Well, you always get kudos for being the one to launch a genre. And while the writing may not be, the advice is pretty damn timeless. People do like to talk about themselves. Appeal to nobler motives. Let the other person feel the idea is theirs. Smile a lot. I´d tell you more, but I don´t want to give away all the secrets I use to manipulate you."
1503,Linda,It was required reading in my 12th-grade business class. I liked it because it was practical. I still remember many of these principles.
1504,Nilam Wulandari,"After I read this book, I have a lot of friends!.Two thumb!."
1505,Leo Nestor,"When the first time I heard of this book, I thought it's another guide of how to live your life for dummies. It attracted my attention when I realised it has been around for much longer than I thought, namely since 1936. This is one of the most important books I read in my life so far."
1506,Bradley Eylander,"Really good book. I cheated unfortunately, and listened to it while driving to Boise ID. Taught good techniques to be a better individual and please people. I couldn’t help thinking this book taught salesmen how to better deceive people into buying their product. Fortunately, the author made points to tell his readers to be genuine in their approach to everybody you meet, not only attempt to “get something out of them.” The book had a lot of key points on being a better person that are valuable for anyone in any situation. If I were to use these key points I’d probably jump up to management really quick in my career field, due to an ability to get along well with people. If I met anyone that had all the characteristics of this book I’d sure get along very well with them.If you don’t want to read the book, I’d say look for the highlights online somewhere and you can save a lot of time and get what you really need out of the book. "
1507,Hazel,If you're:- a bit anti-social- you think you're too shy to make new friends- you think you can't make make friends because you're boring- you want to convince people to pursue your decision or to think like you do- you don't have leadership/people skills (and believe me you need it)- you're joining an organization and you need to get noticed- you basically want to survive social life because everything in this book is needed to add to your life skills
1508,A.,"this is a book about common social interaction; or social interaction that has had its time of being common. Nowadays this book should be required junior high reading so people will grow up having some common decency, manners, and thoughtfulness towards others which would probably result in more social interactions improving dramatically.i remember talking with a teenager about using common decency and common sense.....and she said she thought there was nothing common about them, or else more people would be using them.i think this is an important book."
1509,Cristian Martínez,There are many tools that help you to be a better person to spare appreciation to people and become in many cases a leader. Praise and a big smile to share your happiness.
1510,TK,A highly-entertaining little slice of genius :)
1511,Leona Svetlik,This is my life philosophy. 
1512,Tifa maharani,"waaaw....pokokny recommended bgt laaa buat yang anti sosial....ni buku,,bikin banyak temen bgt,,kereen bgt...Dale Carnegie...Jeniuuus..:D"
1513,AB,"This book really taught me great things. I think the title ""How to Deal with People"" suits more.It isn't the best but it sure is a must-read book.I actually applied everything I could from this book, it really helped.There is another book that has the same principles it is called ""Enjoy your Life"" , ""استمتع بحياتك"" it is also very nice."
1514,Blaid Burgess,Great BookI rather enjoyed the practicality of the approaches Carnegie uses and the endless examples of success from each lesson. I now feel ready top be an effective leader. 
1515,Adrienne Looman,amazing. Simply amazing. I looked at life in a whole new way. Looked at complaining in a more constructive way. This is the best book I think I've ever read.
1516,Arash Narchi,"Dale Carnegie's principles for communication are still practiced today. This is one of my favourite books because it reminds us to listen for the intent of hearing someone out and not for crafting a reply, for putting people first in conversations and practicing empathy.It's an easy read but one you will go back to again and again!"
1517,Adi Narayan Mandalemula,One of the all time great self help books. Thanks to Dale for this gem.
1518,Christian Allen,"An absolute must read for anyone who wants to understand the fundamentals of human dynamics. Best used as a frequent reminder on how we should best behave, to be read over and over again."
1519,Cindy,Everyone should read this book. A classic.
1520,Alicia Bernal,"The book just jumped out of the Bookstore's shelf, figuratively of course- at a time when I was doing FB publication studies for our website. The timing was perfect as I needed to know if I was on the right track. The result is an incredible community of masters from diverse backgrounds coming together for the love of sublime arts, Tielhard de Chardin could not have been more right about his ""noosphere"" in the digital age, when Dale Carnegie's advice is still so aptly most admissible."
1521,Hamish Davidson,"I believe this classic text is still most relevant. If you actually care about other people, Carnegie's advice will already be second nature, but you will still enjoy the amusing stories and anecdotes he uses to demonstrate his concepts. I enjoyed this book and will probably read it again in the future."
1522,Ali Panahi,Amazing! Never read anything like this before.
1523,Pamela J Myers,"One of the best known motivational books in history: Since it was released in 1936, How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie has sold more than 15 million copies. Carnegie’s first book is timeless and appeals equally to business audiences, self-help audiences, and general readers."
1524,Tammy Huynh,"I am very impressed with the book. The title merely describe the book, it is more than that because Dale highlighted appreciation and sincerity throughout this book. It is a must read book if you aim to develop people skills and develop the better ways to communicate with people whether in business, friendship, and family."
1525,Scott,"I was so positively influenced by this book as a teen I now give it away on ""loan"" and never get them back. I always give the cavoit to give it to someone else too. I have given twenty books away and gave ten last year in rememberance of E. personallity. "
1526,Alam Mahmood,I think I have changed a lot after reading this book. Apply this in real life and you will never be disappointed. 
1527,Rui Delgado,I read this book when I was 17 years old. I was hesitant because of the title and I took offense when I was recommended this book. Turned out to be one of the best books I've read and changed me dramatically for the better. Everybody should read this book. Everybody!
1528,Haneen,يعتبر كتاب “كيف تكسب الأصدقاء وتؤثر في الناس” من أكثر الكتب مبيعًا وانتشارًا في العالم، إذ يقدر عدد النسخ المباعة منه بما يزيد عن 16 مليون نسخة.ولعلّ قصة تأليف الكتاب مثيرة وغريبة في الآن نفسه، ويقول ديل كارينجي إنه كان يحضّر لإلقاء كلمة قصيرة في حفل بعنوان “كيف تكسب الأصدقاء وتؤثر في الناس”، لتمتدّ وتصبح محاضرة بمدة ساعة ونصف. لاحظ كارينجي بعد تكرار إلقاء المحاضرة أن مجموعة “قواعد” بدأت تتشكل لديه، فطبعها على قطع ورقية صغيرة، لتصبح فيما بعد نشرة، ثم كتيّبات، وتحوّلت إلى الكتاب الذي نقرأه الآن بعد 15 عامًا من البحث والجمع لقصص النجاح في العلاقات.وربما يكون هذا الجهد والصبر هو أبرز ما يميز كتاب كارينجي، إذ يمكن لأي مدرب تنمية بشرية اليوم أن يكتب عن تعزيز العلاقات الإنسانية (مكتباتنا مليئة بهذه الكتب بالفعل)، لكن من سيصبر على جمع كتاب واحد لمدة 15 عامًا؟ وهل يمكن لكتاب نال كل هذا الاهتمام والجهد أن يكون مشابهًا من حيث المحتوى والنتائج مع سواه؟يقسم الكتاب إلى 5 فصول رئيسية، يستفيض كارينجي في شرحها والتدليل عليها من خلال قصص عاينها أو قرأها أو سمعها من أصحابها، ما بين فنون التعامل مع الناس، إلى طرق كسب محبتهم وجذبهم إلى تفكيرك، السيطرة على الناس دون استبداد، لينتهي بنصائح للتعامل بين الأزواج.الكتاب مهمّ لنا جميعًا، للموظفين والطلاب والمدراء والأزواج والأبناء على حدّ سواء، قد تقرأ نصائح تنفذها بتعاملك مع الناس فطريًا، لكنك بقراءتك عنها ستفعلها بوعي، ما يجعل نتائجها أكثر وضوحًا في حياتك.نشر الكتاب لأول مرة عام 1936، ترجم لعدة لغات ونشرته مكتبة خانجي عام 1951 باللغة العربية، يقع في 286 صفحة.اقتباسات من الكتاب:“إننا نعرف أن السمك يفضل الديدان، لذلك عندما أذهب للصيد لا أفكر فيما أريد أنا من الفروالة والقشدة، بل أفكر فيما يريده السمك ولو أني أفضّل أن أضع بسنارتي الفروالة والقشدة، وأقول: أيها السمك ألا تحبين تناول هذا؟لماذا لا تستخدم نفس الإدراك عند كسب الرجال؟سُئل أحد الأشخاص: كيف نجح في البقاء في السلطة بعد العديد من قادة الحرب الذين تم نسيانهم.أجاب إن بقاءه في الذاكرة وفي القمة كان نتيجة إدراكه أنه من الضروري أن تزوّد السنارة بما يناسب السمك، إن الطريق الوحيد للتأثير في صديق آخر هو أن تحدّثه عما يريده هو وكيف يحصل عليه.رابط مراجعتي على موقع عنب بلديhttp://www.enabbaladi.org/archives/53195
1529,Az,This book helped me be less socially retarded!
1530,Nidal Iguer,Excellent livre qui donne des résultats immédiat.
1531,Chelsea Thompson-o'brien,"A reminder of how the phrasing of your words could be detrimental to the success of a project, relationship or business. I am surprised to read such negativity in the reviews - there's nothing dishonest in these pages. Be a good person and work hard to be self-aware - your peers, reports, clients and bosses will thank you."
1532,Erin L.,"A great book full of helpful insights in how to treat people that makes both them and you feel better. Some parts could be bordering on seeming ""manipulative"" but I think the author does a good job of reiterating the importance of being genuine and honest. Really, it's just a different way to look at things. Definitely a book I want to add to my library and refer to often."
1533,Jim,Picked up on a few more things this time around. Great read!
1534,William McClelland,"One of my all time favorites, and word I try to live by! "
1535,Azez,هذا كتاب...بالفعل الاب الروحي للعلاقات العامه...كتااااب رااائع جدااااااا
1536,anand chittoor,Great book with learnings built on core values of human relationships Easy listening. I suggest an audiobook as well since this is a lot of content. Whisper sync works as a charm. 
1537,Casey Emerson,A friend tried to get me to read this book over a decade ago and I didn't because I thought it was about manipulating people. I read it about three months ago and I couldn't have been more wrong! It's a very basic handbook about relationships (especially in business) and how to adapt to different personalities for successful relationships. Tons of great information.
1538,Ahmed Al-Hulaily,كتاب أكثر من رائع / صحيح أنَّ به بعض النصائح الّتي ما عادت تُفيدنا في أيّامنا هذه و لكنّه كتاب مفيد و قيّم لا يُستغنى عنه / مُقسّم إلى عدّة أقسام تُفيد في الحياة اليوميّة و الحياة الزوجيّة و أنصح به كثيرا
1539,Billcorcoran,"I read this book a decade ago and loved it and recently decided to read it again to get reacquainted with the concepts it espouses. Anyone who is in a sales or management position should read this book. It is the foundation for virtually every self help book that came after it. I love it because it doesn’t read like a sales/management book. It isn’t about a bunch of sales tricks to get people to buy from you. It really is about how if you treat people with respect and live an honest life you will reap enormous rewards not just in business but in life. It is so easy to read and is filled with interesting stories illustrating the points the author is making. Many of the stories are from the life of people like Benjamin Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, John D Rockefeller, Theodore Roosevelt, Gandhi, and just average people who have used the suggestions in this book to improve their life. If I could convince people to read just one self help book in their life, this is the one I would pick."
1540,Stef,Love this book. I have read it many times. 
1541,رهفْ ||Rahaf ,كتآب رآئع بكل مآ تحمله الكلمة من معنى قرأته عديدآ لكن في كل مرة احس بشوق اكبر لهذآ الكتآب 
1542,Bharath,"I don't think I need to recommend this book, because the title itself lures people to read it. "
1543,Candide,Although this isn't a book I'd read by choice (my dad had me read it) I loved the many quotes and ideas on how to become better in life. I'd honestly recommend this one to anyone ages 14 and up.
1544,Khalid Ismail,What a book !. It teaches you how to deal with people and how to make them on your side. 
1545,Shrinivasan G,"I heard it through a librivox recording.The principles are timeless and will be an eyeopener for everyone. The fact that this is a best seller across generations, is a great testimony for the book, format, case studies and the principles.It baffles me, as to why teachers, universities, colleges, schools do not include this as an essential reading before letting students go out to step into the corporate world. This is the best education a teacher/parent can give their wards.Dont miss reading this."
1546,Jaime,"Great book. Everything makes so much sense, but it's hardly ever conscious in people's thoughts.And the reason why I read so many self-help/interpersonal relation books is usually required for my classes. "
1547,Deedubau,This is one of the first self help/development books I've read and still one of the best. Extremely inspirational and well written. Dale Carnegie is a very likable man and this book is practically a bible for self development gurus.
1548,Maxim Vasilkov,"There is no ""secrets"" or magic things. Just about how to be more polite and caring. Must read for everybody and especially for those who feels alone.can find it here https://www.facebook.com/DaleCarnegie..."
1549,Joseph Jay,An Amazing book. Its easy to understand
1550,Kimball,"What a solid book. All optimistic and positive. I love that it was written almost 80 years ago and that the principles and lessons are just as clear and valid as today. That's how you know it's True/Valid: When it stands the Test Of Time. The only part I struggled with is when he discussed letting people ""save face"" (I hate that stupid phrase by the way) even when you know they're wrong. I have mixed feelings about that. I think it's good to not embarrass someone in public but sometimes people need to know they are wrong. Otherwise they'll go their whole lives not knowing just because someone tiptoed around their feelings. He mentioned the way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. Arguments are necessary at times. Perhaps this was the part I need to go back and re-listen to since I struggle with it the most. Now that I read this book ""I'm going to have 100 kids so I can have 100 friends and no one can say no to being my friend."""
1551,Branimir,"Instant classic wort reapeated reading once every year.It just has that ''old timey'' sensibility that seems lost nowadays.If you want to try to experience a little light, feel-good nonfiction I can not recommend this book any more."
1552,Matt Ryall,"I've gone back to my copy of Dale Carnegie's book more than a few times and I never fail to learn something from it. The book is chock full of useful advice about how to deal with people in the real world.If you're a nerd wondering why you're so often misunderstood and have trouble convincing people of your ideas, you need to read this book."
1553,Kevin Hanks,"Easy to see why it's such a classic! This was a well researched, well written book. The principles are easily put forward and the logic is easy to follow. I found it very fun to read (well, listen to anyways ... Thanks audible!). I think I'm going to have to follow up with the audio version and get a printed copy I can peruse and mark up. "
1554,Diego Corzo,Great book that shows how someone can have a better relationship with others and successfully influence others.
1555,Matthew Thomas,Maybe the most important book I've read in my life. Teaches how to be more of an effective communicator and leader
1556,Katie Luman,"Great, practical, helpful, read. On my list of books I think everyone should read."
1557,Raffee,This is a fantastic book. I learned so many new things that can help me become a better person. Not that I'm not one already HAHAHA jokes.
1558,Michael Jeanmary,Great book to read and definitely a re-read type of book. I've implemented a lot of the techniques and can visibly see my life changing for the better.
1559,Gustavo,"Fundamental reading for anyone with less than perfect ""people skills"". While most of the suggestions individually sound like something you should already know, the exemplification and structure of the book makes the ""rules"" crystal clear."
1560,Inna Gubeladze,Super needful and super interesting book for those people who try to succeed in this Life! 
1561,Jonathan Baktay,This book provides clear principles that you should repeatedly read over and practice until they become habitual and a part of your life. I highly recommend it.
1562,Deborah Parker,What a trailblazing book! For Dale Carnegie to put these principles on paper during the early part of the century was a testament to his insight. The issues around human relations continue and this book shows how important it is to give thought to how we interact in the world.It's another book that I keep close by to revisit from time to time.
1563,Leanna Criddle,"Everyone should read this book, especially if you work in account/client management"
1564,Faith Gudal,"This book could be called-How to remember how to be a good person. I realize the title does sound a little like the book is intended to teach you how to manipulate people and get what you want. But in reality, reading this will make you think deeply about how to take care of people and be gracious. And as a benefit, you will have made friends and influenced people. It's a short, quick read-don't be turned off by the copyright haha. It is still just as applicable. "
1565,Kevin Huang,very good
1566,Cliffside Park Public Library (NJ),"How to Win Friends and Influence People teaches people how to make others like them, and gives tips on how you can be a leader among others in your job or class. It gives real-life examples of how choice of words and body language can change how tough conversations and meetings end, and gives different approaches of solving problems. It can help people of all ages with everyday situations they struggle to handle, and give young people important life lessons that can get them on the right path in life. I would recommend this book to a friend because it gives tips on how to treat others well, and it can bring out positive change to his/her environment if the techniques are applied properly. It is a highly rated book that can always help you at whatever age you are, and it is a very quick read. It definitely inspires you to read more books that give life tips and teaches you that your cup is never full.T.J. Grade 10CLPK Young Adult Readers Advisory Board Member"
1567,Panata Harianja,"Saya sebetulnya dulu suka sebel kalo liat buku-buku self-help atau self-improvement, tapi setelah ketemu buku ini pandangan saya berubah. Buku ini bukan saya beli. Entah gimana buku ini ada di rumah kontrakan saya jaman kuliah dulu. Dicuekin, dianggap gak penting. Tapi begitu mulai baca, ternyata sulit berhenti.Buku ini (yang saya punya edisi terjemahan bahasa Indonesia), adalah hasil perahan pengalaman hidup dan pengalaman berbisnis dari penulisnya. Saking hebatnya dia sebagai motivator nama Carnegie bahkan mendunia lewat kursus-kursusnya. Saking hebatnya buku ini, kalau tak salah buku ini juga jadi kitab pegangannya para pelaku bisnis MLM.Kalau pepatah bilang 'pengalaman adalah guru yang paling baik', maka buat saya 'pengalaman orang lain adalah guru yang lebih baik lagi'. Kenapa? Karena orang yang menulis pengalamannya sudah berbaik hati mau mengajak orang menghindari kesalahan yang sama. Buat apa dia berbuat begitu? Agar orang lain jauh lebih berkembang tanpa mengulang kesalahan-kesalahan yang sama. Saya gak akan bocorin isi bukunya. Tapi yang pasti, si penulis menunjukkan satu kebenaran yang tak berubah hingga hari ini. Yaitu, bisnis apapun adalah perkara bagaimana kita memahami hubungan antar manusia. Seorang pebisnis tangguh adalah seorang pembelajar unggul tentang manusia. Memahami dirinya dan memahami orang lain. Keahlian itulah yang akan terlihat dalam komunikasi, bicara dan dalam bernegosiasi dengan lain.Buku ini saya anjurkan dibaca oleh siapapun, umur berapapun dengan bisnis apapun."
1568,Jessica,"If you want to know how to win someone's respect, or convince them to your way of thinking, this is the book I would recommend. Carnegie has some very interesting (not to mention useful) theories about human behaivior. -VERY cool book. "
1569,Prashant Kelker,Written nearly eighty years ago and still so relevant!
1570,Link,"This book has become more pertinent than ever. In a culture in which snark rules, it is good to have a wise and benevolent voice setting forth principles of personal respect and practical courtesy. Although there are a few devices Carnegie suggests using, he also tells the reader to be genuinely interested in other people, to provide honest appreciation, to practice sincere friendliness and also to do tough things like readily admit mistakes. Read the book Carnegie wrote, not the one he is often presumed to have written. "
1571,Anna,"This is a classic book that I hope EVERYONE reads. It seems like common sense, but so many people do not follow these principles. The world would be a much kinder and pleasant place if everyone would follow the principles that Carnegie discusses in this book."
1572,Rachel Greco,Everyone should read this book! It helps you understand human nature.
1573,Maryanne,"My dad walked in, turned the light on in my dim room, barked ""Don't read without your light on"", threw this book on my bed and said, ""Read this one"". Okay. Still five stars to me."
1574,Romulo Velasco iii,"This is an amazing book! It's broken down into principles, and they are very easy to understand. One thing about this book,though. Read it slowly and apply the concepts in your daily interactions. Don't rush through the book! Take your time and make sure you understand and apply the principles. Personally, the principles work like a charm! Probably, the best human relations/behavior book I have read, so far..."
1575,Christian E,"Just read it, and apply this principles in your life. You will be pleased. Really, just read it. I would recommend it to ANYONE."
1576,Lina,by far the greatest wisdom and life lesson I have acquired through a book. I really recommend this to everyone. :)
1577,Mandi Pralle,I've read a few times...
1578,Marty,Recently re-read and it is a great as ever.Took lots of notes.
1579,Kathy,"I kept this book close a long time, if I had a minute a read a concept, now is seems like just plain common sense, but if you don't know these principes, you have to work on them."
1580,Matthew Campbell,"This book should be in every elementary classroom, its the fundamentals of how to communicate with other people."
1581,Joseph Young,"The audio version is not nearly as good. The speaker does not arouse excitement or eagerness in me. I know I shouldn't criticize, condemn or complain, but this guy is awful. He has no freaking up-tone! He completely lacks the sense of playful rascal-sense that Carnegie's original text holds. Although he has a sophisticated voice, his vocal range is not suited to this book. Don't bother with the audio book, go for the paperback; it'll be one of the best investments in your life.I've loved this book ever since I was 10, and find that reading it every couple of years helps keep me sharp, and stay up top. It's amazing what you can forget in a few months, or even mere moments. Every time you read it, it gives you something. "
1582,Vinny Pardi,"This book was very good and insightful, it's just too bad that the title makes it sound like you are desperate or trying to take over the world if you're reading it. Makes it awkward to recommend"
1583,Mahendr bakolia,this is a great friend winning book 
1584,Jay M,"After reading this book, it has give me a better understanding of how people behave and how to engage with them effectively. I now look forward to having intelligent conversations with some people! This book can help with building stronger relationships and motivational techniques, something that is really necessary in today's day and age. But ultimately it can aid in the process of getting the best out of people! "
1585,Nhi Hexe,"Never old-fashioned. You always can learn from this book no matter how old, mature you are."
1586,Nikka Calindas,"What I observed from this book is that the truths stated within are also the truth within other 'self-help' books - hence it is quite appropriate to call this one the 'original'.Though I had my frustrations in reading this (owing that the book clearly suggested you read each other TWICE, then meditate upon them before moving on to the next chapter), I found that the morals and lessons does quite stick when read according to the rules stated in the preface.Other self-help books can be regarded as further readings. But 'How to Win Friends & Influence People' should really be on top of anybody's list who wanted to change their lives and make a difference. "
1587,Ryan Barron,"This has to be one of my favorites, although difficult to read. Re-reading every chapter was a tough task but totally worth it with all of the wonderful information on how to interact with others!"
1588,luis,The best course of human relationsReally great book to read. Everybody should read this. It will change your social life for ever! I totally recommend it.
1589,Hussein,Wow. I don't read many books but this was amazing. I'll have to re read it very soon because t was that good. It is filled with theories but also examples of implementation of the theories and ideasTop book
1590,Larisha,"Timeless classic by Dale Carnegie. Carnegie studied Lincoln, Roosevelt, Charles Schwab and many others and this book has a number of great examples of positive human relations on not criticizing, talking about your own mistakes first, spurring others onto success."
1591,Lorna,"This book will stay on my shelves forever. I wish I had had it earlier in life; I now know how my husband is the calm, wonderfully awesome man I have admired for years ( he read this book long ago) and I will reread this every few months for the rest of my life."
1592,Xpresscarrental, Nice Book turn the thinking...!!Communication is the best attractive art. And this art is a touching feel.  For details http://bit.ly/23ngEu9
1593,Marnie,And re-read and will eventually read again...
1594,Ben Klopfer,"Dale Carnegie’s well-known book is by far the best business book I have ever read. Possibly the best book overall I have ever read. Carnegie was born in to poverty and made a tremendous living lecturing on self-improvement. He believed that the best way to change other people’s behavior is by changing your own reaction to them. The publishing of this book represents his crowning achievement in life, and outlines his learned principles for accomplishing success. You simply can’t come out of reading this book with anything but a positive, sunny outlook on life. If you read this and discover you embody just a quarter of the principles he describes, you are already a marvelous individual. This book reminds us what it truly means to be a good person–striving always for the ideal, the best, in ourselves. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll pick it up for a re-read."
1595,Jennifer,"Written in the 1930's. One of the best, informative books I've ever read! Get your thought processes turned around for the better. "
1596,Joakim,"I love this book, well worth reading!"
1597,Blake,the stories are just the best.
1598,Mostafa Ahmed,One of the most amazing books i have ever read.totally recommended
1599,Robert,I've read this book several times - applying Christ's teachings to living - good for all generations and a must read for everyone.
1600,Farah,"It is a really nice book, because i read it twice :P. It teaches you how to be kind to people even though youare completely different. Donna Dale Carnegie has a lot of information and knows how to explain well. She puts examples of what girls have gone through in real life, there is a reality check, and the thing that i like the most is that she is explaining it as if she is talking to you in real life. "
1601,Nick,A must read for everyone.
1602,Mary ,Amazing book. So well written. Perfect examples. Timeless. 
1603,Sam Erickson,"I began listening to this book primarily to see what all the hubbub was about. It had received recommendation after recommendation and I honestly had a hard time believing it was that great having looked at summaries. That was the biggest mistake. If you read the summary of this book and the listing of the principles you will assume everything in this is obvious and say ""well duh"". Unfortunately it is the same as being given a bunch of math formulas and saying ""well duh that's how the basic structure of the universe works"". Until you see some examples, have them spelled out for you, and hear stories of their creative application you can't appreciate the immense value they have. The topics Dale Carnegie covers offer a lifetime of wisdom in interacting with other human beings. "
1604,David Wijaya,I regret why didn't I read this book years before...
1605,Soluc,"The essence of the book is great, even though it was written over 80 years ago we haven't change that much. The bad:the book has a strong bias towards chauvinism. "
1606,Dale,"I can't begin to tell you how useful this book has been to me. I read it long ago, the message stayed with me, and has helped me so much in my life ever after. A must read for anyone struggling to get along."
1607,Romnick Ladera,Good Book!
1608,Dave Emmett,"This book is surprisingly current for something written 75 years ago. The advice is so simple and so obvious that you can't help but wonder why people even need to read it, and yet I felt like I learned something and find myself mentally checking the things I'm writing to others against Dale's rules. To sum it up the advice from the book in a few words: be genuinely interested in other people and appeal to their interests, not your own. "
1609,Kory,"What an excellent book! The principles are very applicable to any job situation, or really any interaction with humans. If I had to say a negative I would definitely say it is dated, and many of the examples he gives to illustrate his points are historically based (many during the Lincoln days). He frequently cites military leaders and presidents. This did get a little monotonous by the end. I definitely think anyone could benefit from the advice in this book. It will be a book you will want to have on your shelf to consult before any type of confrontation. "
1610,Daniel Domenech,"This book is great!!! It basically explains that the keys to good relationships are appreciation, tolerance, listening to others, and a positive attitude."
1611,Диана Петрова,Прочетох я на 14 години. Върши работа :)
1612,jonathan,"If you are looking for something to remind you what a terrible, self-absorbed asshole you are, this is a great read."
1613,Brandon,Helpful since I'm far from socially adept.
1614,Chris Cano,This is a classic that everyone should read. Seriously.
1615,Tony La rosa,"This is a great book, a great read for anyone."
1616,Chuck,this book should be on everyone's shelf. I have read it at least 6 times 
1617,Nicky Llerena,WowIt helped me to improve my relationship with my friends and parents. It also gave me a good understanding of other's point of view.
1618,Manugw,"A TOTAL WINNERWhat can I add about one of the books most ever read after the Bible in a simple review ? Well, I think that Dale Carnegie found a practical application of the Ancient Jewish Principles encompassed in the ""Ethics of the Fathers"" and in the Jewish Torah itself altogether, and this is one of the reasons why the book became so successful, it is backed by four thousand years old wisdom, the time mankind took to evolve into a civilization During the 20th century, Dale Carnegie got to the same conclusion that, King Solomon, the wisest of the Jewish Sages, had reached almost three thousand years ago, ""..vanity of vanities; all is vanity.."" I can also add, that the first time I took myself to apply the principles detailed by Carnegie to solve a problem, the people I was negotiating with not only expressed their total satisfaction for the solution I had found, they also congratulated me, and, frankly, I did not expect that reaction And then, for the first time, I realized that knowing how to deal with people is as important in life as having the best education one can afford. If you have finished college and thought you have graduated, first read this book, I can assure you that your life will change for the better "
1619,Josip Brecak,"At first I was skeptical to buy this book. ""How to Win Friends"". Honestly felt like I was going to look like a loser buying this book, but I have to say, I am extremely glad that I picked up this book and far from feeling like a loser. The concepts in this book are entirely true. All these small things we could do that would improve our relationships with the people around us.Yet we tend to ignore them and take things for granted. Especially when they're obvious. For an example, to smile and appreciate others. (SOME SPOILER)Some of you might be unwilling to buy this book, maybe cause you might think it is a scam. Well I can assure you that it is not, from my personal experience through the principles that is contained in this book.Heres a little story:A week ago before I finished this book, I was reading it during a religion discussion class. The sister told me to put the book down 3 times and wanted to see me after the class. We spoke what ""was wrong with me"", and I just defended my self saying "" Time is precious, and I rather use it being productive and learning something valuable"" ( We weren't even talking about anything during that class. Barely even talked about religion )- In the book, principle 2 states ""Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, ""You're Wrong"" If you do you have struck a direct blow at their intelligence, judgement, pride and self-respect. And that's what happened when she asked ""What was wrong with me"" and I was quick to defend myself. She then went onto give me advice(since I want to be entrepreneur(high recommend this book if you want to become one as well) and said, each person is your customer and you must listen. I told her thank you and that I honestly did learn a lesson from what she is said. As I went on to read the next chapter of the book was Principle 2 ""Give honest and sincere appreciation"". Just like I had done to the sister. And her response was ""Really!?! With a big smile on her face. You could tell she felt ""important"". Which in the book is one humans most desirable feelings to feel. Then the next day I continued reading the book , I got to part 2 of the book . And I was shocked to see Principle 4 which states"" Be a good listener."" I was like wow that's what sister had told me to do. So all Im trying to point out is that, each day you can find principles of this book being applied to our daily lives and relationships without us noticing.And one more thing, Principle 8- Try honestly to see things from the other's persons point of view. I feel like this is far the most important principle of them all, if not, one of them. My dad tells me all the time when I get into fights with my mom/him, that I have to look from their point of view. Either though I don't like it, it is true. It is a hard thing to do, since human nature is quick to judge. If only we could refrain from judging, and just step back and become more open minded. Maybe then, the world might be a better place.Oh and if you came this far in my review, this is my first book review I ever written. So for me to write this review, this book must be worth it."
1620,S.A.,"Life changing for me as a teenager, again as adult!"
1621,Ben Sutter,"Largely anecdotal, but simple, powerful ideas. I'm embarrassed by how much of this stuff I'd never actually thought about hard enough to understand up until now. "
1622,Gaurav Prabhu,This books holds true even now & will for coming time. Really wonderful insights on developing good relations. This book is even a must read for people in hospitality industry. Dale Carneige shines throughout!
1623,Yassine Laroussi,this will change your whole perspective to interacting with people everyday.
1624,Peter Galamaga,Fantastic resource to help remind you how kindness and respect improves one's relationships and sense of well being. Sounds obvious - but most of us could use this book as a reminder of how to best practice these things.
1625,Nicole,"There is nothing in this book that you probably haven't heard before, but it's great to have them all in one location. It's a good read. It was very motivational. I would read this one again in the future"
1626,Alexis Avila,it's a classic bc you can apply the same principals today. nuggets of practical wisdom
1627,Danilo Stern-Sapad,A commonsense guide to human relations. Hint: have tact and listen.
1628,Sam Feder,"I was deciding whether I'd read this book and a starkly different book, Vagabonding by Rolf Potts, this December. Eventually, after careful deliberations, I settled on Vagabonding.However, the very first paragraph of Vagabonding details the narrator, floating down a river in Thailand, desperate for a read. He stumbled upon a setting that had exactly one English book, How To Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. The narrator continues on to tell his readers on how this book affects him and inspires him to write the book I was currently reading.I took it as a sign.I find myself sometimes aggravating friends, and oftentimes aggravating coworkers when making suggestions and expressing my desires for their and my own productivity. I expected there were ways to express myself without upsetting people, and figured that this book could give me a baseline for contorting myself in these environments.It did. This book tells you what you should have been taught in elementary school. While the book doesn't tell you anything you don't know, it tells you things explicitly in ways you may have not considered. Each principle includes multiple examples of how they have helped different people in home-life, work-life, and life altogether. It was a fun practice to study each chapter each day and ensure that I followed the principles dictated in that chapter to ""win"" some friends and ""influence"" some people. Again, this is basic information, and it shouldn't be hard to consciously observe the suggestions in this bookI can see the potential for the principles in this book to lead to manipulation, but I doubt it could be used for truly malicious purposes. All in all, this book is very very good, and makes my must-read books as far as self-help books go."
1629,Relleasy Harrison,This book gave me more awareness. You never know what someone is going through and something as simple as a smile can make them feel better. Even when i am feeling down and out i think about the book and try not to let that take control of me or the people around me. any situation you are in and you do not like.... you can make it better or cry about it like a little ho!!! enjoy life 
1630,Ryan Tomkins,One of the best books on how to communicate with purpose. A must have for your personal library. 
1631,Jaspreet Narang,"Very nice book. A lot of suggestions in this book are common-sense but we all fail to use them. This book reminds and suggests to Smile, Stay Humble and Accept your mistakes. Overall, the first 3 sections are really good but the last one gets a bit boring (at least that's what I think), the last section could have been better.Overall, I really suggest this book... a Must read"
1632,Archuleta Chick,"This is a great book! I've learned so many things from it. I have been praising people and made so many more friends since I read this, and I'm reading it again! wahoo!"
1633,Miss Mouse,"This is a real 'Duh' book. No magical formulas, or anything about how to take advantage of people but really just common sense about how to treat people. But, sometimes we really need this as a refresher."
1634,Christopher  Kemur,i learned a lot about social skills from this book and all of the lessons are applicable in daily life.
1635,Kyle Campbell,"All-time classic! Must read for anyone! Great book for living, life and success."
1636,Audra Gines,"I just started reading this because a friend of mine was telling me that everyone should own a copy! I have only been reading this for two days, and already I am in agreement with her. It's definitely a book that you will read over and over again; a book that will influence you and the rest of your life!"
1637,Hanaa El-Sherbiny,one of the BEST !It helps me alot ..
1638,Molly,"Great guide for daily diplomacy. Does a good job of re-framing interactions, with relatable examples, to highlight what a difference a simple change of perspective can make when working with others toward a goal. Highly recommend. This is one of those books that can completely change the way you think about the world around you, the people in it, and how you interact with them. "
1639,Sondra Willhite,"This book is a classic for a reason. Although the writing may not stand the test of time (it's not terrible, just a little stilted by today's standard), the tenets still hold true. There's no earth-shattering advice in this book. Everything in it is intuitive when we regard the advice on how we want others to treat us. But it's in the application of applying the advice to others that we all benefit from being reminded of. It's uncommon common sense, and worth reading and re-reading. "
1640,Harizah Kamaruzaman,The best book about human relation. still relevant up till now.
1641,Jackie Davis,"This is a must read for everyone...I tested the practices suggested in the book as I read it and the results are incredible. I'll be reading this 2X a year forever, or a good while at least. Highly, highly, highly recommend!"
1642,Roshan Perera,"A must read book for entrepreneurs. It will not only motivate you to be better among people, but also help you improve yourself. From creating wonderful things to making sales and influencing customers to buy products, this book covers them all."
1643,Nathan,Fantastic! Application will help in all aspects of life.
1644,Joel,A must-read book for those who want to reach the top--and stay there.
1645,Serra Zander,"Lots of good advice, if not a bit dated examples. Seriously though, you can get past that. Definitely a good book for anyone who wants to improve their ability to function in public or with people. "
1646,Ryan,Dale Carnegie menciptakan formula yang mengesankan untuk menciptakan hubungan yang lebih baik antar manusia. Salah satu pelajaran yang paling saya ingat : Satu-satunya cara untuk memenangkan perdebatan adalah menghindarinya.
1647,April Larcher,"great bookThis book is a must read for everyone. Although there are many chapters that are common sense, this book serves as a great reminder for all. "
1648,Nitesh,"fine book, adds to your way of tackling difficult problems of real life into easy way. also defines the ways to tackle people influentiallyI liked it "
1649,Halima Aquino,"Don't worry- it's not a manipulative book! This is a book about manners. The world, our country and our homes would be much better places if we all just kept this book on our night tables.These bits of wisdom are things we should have learned at home and school but our laziness, coolness, competitiveness, rebellions and snarky ways- just got in the way!If you have children and you want to give them practical and timeless wisdom about good social skills that will last them a lifetime-(from an expert who really understands why we haven't achieved peace and prosperity, love and comfort in the world)- then share this book of age-old wisdom from a timeless and respected author. If you're an employee, family member or friend - this book will help you too!"
1650,Quinn Curtis,I recommend this book for anyone especially in business and attend networking functions. 
1651,Mark Manderson,Such simple and fundamental information that has held true over the test of time. This should be a must have in all personal libraries.
1652,Mutamuriza,"""any one can criticize, condemn and complain but it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving""""if there's any one secret of success it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own"""
1653,Whitney Bowman,"Loved the real-life, solid advice. Could be dry, but the quality was so worth it!"
1654,Scott Hicks,"With one of the most pretentious and seemingly manipulative titles, and an even more pretentious introduction, I was a bit off put in the beginning with How to Win Friends and Influence People; however, knowing its reputation I trudged on, and I am glad I did.I think the content of this book is crucial to know, as it deals with probably what is of the utmost importance in our world: people. If a book of the ""self-help"" genre doesn't appeal to you, let me say that nearly everything within this book can be summed up in two words: be nice. Almost all the tips and examples of how to deal with people are truly common sense, yet it's still eye opening as you reflect on how simple and powerful the easiest of gestures can be.It's interesting to think how universal these ideas are, and how they truly can stand the test of time. I'm curious if Carnegie knew back in 1936 when How to Win Friends and Influence People was first published the impact it would have, and if he knew it would still be read a great deal more than seventy years later. While you have most likely heard of each of the pieces of advice at least once in your life, the elaboration and use of historical examples, as well as Carnegie's ""brash and breezy"" style along with his 1930's slang keeps the entire experience intriguing and captivating. It's easy to see the effect each and every one of his tips has on people, and it's a book that you can get the most out of with practice of the tips and observation of the results.It's hard to nitpick a book that's both entertaining and interesting, and has an underlying message of just being kind, considerate, and thoughtful. While it did not reveal to me anything mind-blowing or shocking, it served as a reminder of how to properly interact with others and gave me a heightened sense of social awareness, and I'm sure my life will be all the better for it. I'm also sure I'll be reading this again more than once in the years to come."
1655,Takedown,Absolutely great book and more important still relevant.In this book you will read about how to handle people communication effectively and make more out of it.
1656,Nabil Hamed,الكتاب الذي غيّر حياتي ..
1657,Regina,Amazing book! Everyone should read it!
1658,Kris,My college age daughter has read this every year for the last 10 yrs and says it has made a big difference in her life.This has been one of the all- time bestsellers for the past 60 yrs and there is a good reason for that.
1659,emma seven,it is so easy to live simply and happily contented
1660,Parijat Mishra,In one word - Amazing. This book changed my life.
1661,Karla Jacqueline,This book is one of those you need to read over and over again. 
1662,Nicki,Loved this book. Nothing in here is truly groundbreaking - it's all stuff I've heard before - but the way he puts it together is really inspiring. Made me think long and hard about how I act toward other people. 
1663,Eng.Asma,كتاب ممتع ولكن الترجمة كانت ضعيفة في بعض المواضيعسيكون أجمل لو كان كاتبه مسلم ودعّمه ببعض الآيات والأحاديث
1664,Jennifer Murray,"Very good book. It is a lot of common sense when you read it, but isn't something you necessarily think of during the moment. It's one of the best personal development books I have read."
1665,Elena Ose,"Incredible book! Simply put, but so richly backed with examples. Particularly, loved how the author explained the anatomy of certain essentials: the words ""yes"", ""no"", ""praise"", ""flattery"". Most importantly how it is vital to step into other person's shoes. Elementary; we so often forget about that trivia.Title doesn't do the book justice."
1666,Maurice Rubino,Step by step guide to changing your paradigm and becoming a more influential person in all your daily roles both personal and work related
1667,Cami Putnam,I learned a lot from this book. Although some of it is common sense and I already knew it's good to hear a refresher course on it and remember why we treat people with respect and kindness and to be interested in others and not so stuck on ourselves. This is a must read for my kids too. My 17 year old read it last week now on to my 15 year old.
1668,Pascal Wagner,"Read:Nov 1, 2011Sep 20th, 2015"
1669,Richard  Ni,A must-read unless you don't wanna deal with people.
1670,Brooke,"I got my hands on my grandfathers copy of this book published in 1936, I enjoyed it, the author has great advice if you want people to like you. Congrats to those who can do it."
1671,Luis,This book was written almost seventy years ago and still the principles and strategies that are laid forth for enhancing people skills are spot on. If reading this book doesn't help you deal with people than you have no hope. 
1672,Sasha Ignk,"I never fathomed sitcom ""The Nanny"" believable until I read this ;-)"
1673,Tony Wang," I am reading a fabulous book,I think I must tell you what this book.I want more people can read it because you must like it.I recommend the book-How to make friends and influence people sincerely.And this book was translated to many main languages in the world.You should try it. How to Win Friends and Influence People is one of the first best-selling self-help books.This book is about “increasing our popularity” “Enable you to make friends quickly and easily” “Become genuinely interested in other people”etc. After read this book,we can get many help from it.It also can make our life get better even we can feel more happy than past.So,I think this is a self-educational book. There are many parts in this book,they all about how to change our self to influence the people that we can touch. I think the author do well on come up with many advice and used many examples to show how the advises worked.Some advice even include two or three instance to connect it.In my opinion,I cannot come up with any place can be better,this is a perfect book.At the same time,this book must be compelling and page turner.When you read first chapter,you must want to read next chapter until you finish this book.Because this book can bring qualitative help for readers. I suggest the people who feel not happy everyday or always feel under much pressure really should read this book.I swear you can be better by this book.In fact,not only the people I mentioned above,but also everybody should be potential person. To sum up,this is a self-education book,when we read this book,we can get a lot of help from it.Everybody should read it to improve the quality of our life.	"
1674,Andris Vizulis,must read for anyone
1675,Matthew Reyes,"This book makes a bold promise to the reader.It proclaims itself to be: “The Only Book You Need to Lead You to Success.”Although skeptics may reject this idea immediately, doing so would be a major mistake.Carnegie’s advice is repeatedly proven to be as good as gold, through the use of anecdotes & examples. Chapters build on each other by focusing on one skill-set at a time. By applying the principles outlined in each chapter, the value of this book will be engraved in one’s mind. Repetition is used sparingly to reference previous material. Although some examples may seem miraculous, by simply following this book’s advice remarkable changes will appear in your life.Like water in a barren desert, this book is able to give life to whoever finds it.Dale Carnegie’s brilliant mind brings soul to his inspiring writing; it is as if he were sitting beside the reader, guiding them through every page. Similar to a loving father, his tone is compassionate yet authoritative. My recommendation is for any prospective reader whom selects this book, to follow Carnegie’s advice without delay. Persisting in their efforts until they too become a master of communication."
1676,Car,"This book is AWESOME! This is a great read for anyone who is looking to brush up on their human relations skills. To see my full review, click here: http://www.associatedcontent.com/arti..."
1677,Huda,"I really liked this book and it was interesting. It taught me a lot about how to make more friends and make less enemies. Chapter 1 was my favourite along with, chapter 4, chapter 7 and the last chapter. It taught me to get along with my peers, not act bossy around people, always smile and say hi and never bully people. "
1678,Jack Perry,Dale Carnegie wasn't fazed by the dire economic times in 1937 when he published How To Win fiends and Influence People. In the worst of times his gem became a run-away best seller and continues to be valuable tool for all of us today. Why? Carnegie reveals to you basic truths in plain language that show you how to appeal to people and win their confidence. Don't be put off by the fact that it was published 76 plus years ago. Assign it as reading for all the young students and adults in your family. 
1679,Usman Ali,One of the best books I have read so far!
1680,Adam,A must read self help book. 
1681,Susan Devy,"if I have to choose one book that has influenced and changed my life and my point of view to others, then unquestionably this book is the one.I heard about this ""bible"" so many times, people quoted this book, but I never had interest to read it until my father gave me an old copy of this book. and as I read it, I couldn't put it down till I got into the last page !What I like most about this book is the way Carniegie elaborated his main points and sub-points with stories, not just common stories but very interesting stories from AL-capone, Lincoln, and many more.I found that those lessons that I had learned from this book is timeless and priceless, somehow I just want to read it again and again, and still I learn a new insight from it. And the one thing that I don't like about this book is the title......""How to Win friends and Influence people"" ? well, if this book is launched during modern days, most likely people will misjudge it as a MLM guidance book ! "
1682,Robin,"Unfortunate title for such an amazing book. It is a compilation of Dale Carnegie's collection of books on dealing with people. I had a friend growing up who must have read this in her youth because she has always been an amazing communicator, showing intense interest in others, therefore, making her well loved by those she has taken such interest in. Highly recommended on everyone's bookshelf!"
1683,Jonathan Stiansen,"To be perfectly honest I can't rememeber a LOT of this book. In the past I've read through it twice or three times, I do remember being recognizing that lots of people (especially in our modern society) should read this book. It purpose is to treat people with dignity respect, not some magic formula for manipulation. (I believe) its a powerful book."
1684,Summer," I wish everyone would read this and live by it socially. It's simple and easy to understand, but profound because hardly anyone I know actually reacts to interaction in this way. I wish everyone would read this and live by it socially. What ever happened to common courtesy? I really enjoyed all the simple tactics in this book that, if you're willing to read between the lines, shout out help in almost every life situation."
1685,Ricardo Fabrizio,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It gives you a lot of practical rules to handle many kinds of problems and help you get what you want, through diplomacy and the good treating with others. Excellent book."
1686,Sam,Be sincere and become genuinely interested in other people.
1687,Mohdalshawan alshawan,من ضمن الكتب التي تشرح دور كسب المحبة من الناس
1688,Roger,Still one of the best business books ever!
1689,Sanath Kumar,This book is indeed a game-changer. Just 30 pages into the book and it is already having a profound impact on my character. This is one of the timeless classics ever!!
1690,Adam Johnson,"Fantastic!! This books includes very useful tips on how to be a better person. The tittle makes it sounds self serving and shallow, but in truth I feel that by applying some of the principals not only can I do better professionally, but I feel I can be better as a husband, father, and friend as well. I plan on re-reading this often."
1691,Ruye,I thought it was one of the best way for people to learn how to improve their human communication. It gave many example for people to know how to win friends and influence people.
1692,Brandon Lee,Should be required in high school reading. Basic people skills that are never taught. 
1693,Gary,"I should have read this ages ago. I need to re-read it again, and again, and again, and ...."
1694,Azman Hafid,one of books that shape my life
1695,Kate,EVERYONE should read this. It's a great handbook on how to deal with people in almost any situation. 
1696,Alexander Clawson,Very good book. Clear structure and good content.
1697,AJ Ostrow,"Learned a lot, and interested to see how having read it affects my personality. "
1698,Sarhn McArthur,This is a book everyone should read again and again and again. I read this book every year. I actually can not remember when I first read this book.
1699,Niko Batir,Great book!!So many things that can be learn from reading this book. Taught me so many key points and wisdom in dealing people and situations that is very relevant in my course.
1700,Wendy,This book is full of delightful anecdotes and positive solutions to problems. Everyone should read it. The messages are timeless.
1701,Jordan 1,"Dale Carnegie is an excellent teacher, and writes in a very straightforward manner. He uses clear examples, and language that is motivating.A must-read for anyone looking to understand the dynamics of human interaction."
1702,Shawna,Nice quick read packed with valuable people management insights. I would recommend it to anyone in a leadership position as well as anyone that is having difficulties relating to others.
1703,Gerardo Esquivel,This is one of the best books I have ever read. It has helped me to be a more confident person in my every day life.
1704,Devon Hinton,"This book pushes forwards a 'results driven' 'other focused' manner of dealing with people. That will lead to better friendships, greater business success, and overall happiness.It contains a series of practical principles to deal with people. Each of which is supported by anecdotal evidence that is convincing (though of course anecdotal evidence is not good evidence). However, further evidence can be gained simply by using these principles yourself and seeing the immediate changes.More then a series of practical principles, Carnegie shows you how your assumptions about others and your day to day mannerisms are misinformed. You will learn how if you're goal is to have 'results' and not some childish pleasure of 'venting' then it is much better to not argue, but push forward your ideas in other ways.A sneak peak is the high level idea that damaging a person's self-perspective or arguing directly against their beliefs is as harmful and rude as physically punching them. And most importantly, the single best take away, years spent trying to charm people is far less effective then simply taking a genuine interest in other people."
1705,David Tenniswood,"Very helpful, practical book on relationships and working successfully with people. I'll be recommending it to my kids in their teens!"
1706,Jack Poole,One of the best books in print. A must read for any person looking to develop themselvs!
1707,Cariongtyll,This is a great book.It should be read again and again as it gives positive tips to increase your personality and perception about people and yourself.
1708,Mellissa Thomas,"Amazing book on human relations and leadership. Every literate human being needs this. (That may sound like hyperbole, but it's true.) The principles are true, timeless, and always effective. Read it at least once a year."
1709,Janine Schütze,"Jeder der lernen möchte besser mit unterschiedlichsten Menschen umzugehen sollte Dale Carnegie lesen. Praktische Tipps zum Umgang mit anderen und mit sich selbst, großartiges Buch. Lesen, nochmal lesen, weglegen und was anderes lesen, wieder von vorne mit Carnegie anfangen ;)"
1710,Yogesh Mehra,"Its a life changing book, personally for me.Things are beautifully described with ample examples portraying vivid scenarios.Things starts from being polite and goes all the way to inducing rational thing in yourself and others.I would recommend it all my friends and family to read it and shape their prospective to live a better and more effective life."
1711,Christine Leber,"This book changed my life, literally. I was never a ""self-help"" reader, but I read this book at a key point in my career where I needed to gain perspective on how to work and manage other people. It truly changed my perspective on how to deal with my day to day life. ""Accept it, leave it, or change it."""
1712,Sandy Wells,"I try to read this one each year, as I always do a little better with some principle each time. It's one of my favorites to help me back up and remember to see things thru others' perspectives."
1713,Anna Kelberg,"A very fruitful book for anyone, really. Many advice on how to communicate with people. "
1714,Shawn Camp,This is one of those books where you know every section like the back of your hand but are compelled to retread once a year just to re-energize yourself for whatever you do. If your in sales or just want to get further in your career this book should be in your library with well worn pages and a cover falling off.
1715,Rajagopalan Venkatakrishnan,The single most effective book that led to great change in my life.
1716,Melanie Walker,"This is a great book and helped me to rethink and analyze situations in the past that I could have handled differently, and most importantly, what to do now! A book about empathy and caring about others. As Professor Dumbledore says, kindness is ""a trait people never fail to undervalue."" "
1717,Troy Connor,This book was phenomenal!!!! I did what the book suggested and read each chapter twice highlighting key points. I loved the principles and summaries that the book provided. The application of each principle is outstanding. Once you start reading it seems like it just works. I will be reading this again and I recommend everyone to read this as well.
1718,Ahmed Hassan,simple facts with simple acts.. needs practice and repetitive readings though..
1719,Mr. Shits,"I must have read this book 3 times. This is not just the stereotypical book for business professionals, it works for everyone. He has list of very basic common sense rules that just click when dealing with people. "
1720,Shorel Kleinert,"""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" is one of those books that I was a fool for having not read earlier in life. I had assumed the title meant ""how to manipulate people"". How foolish I was. This book is a masterful guide in how to communicate with tact, courtesy and respect...and thereby building others up along with solving the ""problem"" you might have with that person. This is a book that the current generation needs to read, the generation that is so quick to point out faults by every review or comment. Read this, my fellow fool, and you will be the better for it."
1721,Stefanie,<3 <3 <3 The best self-development book i've ever read so far ;)Lots of things to learn from this book :)
1722,Owen,"I wrote this review some two years ago, perhaps a little more. Since then, it has attracted the unbelievable number of soi-disant negative or unhelpful votes of 152 (June 2004)(and now, in November 2007, the count is 10 Useful and only 102 Not Useful - stranger and stranger!). I suppose it is the work of one person, as one scarcely imagines there are so many people out there who would care enough about this particular work (or about this particular writer - me). Nevertheless it is a fascinating statistic and it adds a little more colour to our understanding of a world which is already malfunctioning in numerous other ways.Here's the original review:I guess if Dale Carnegie was writing today, he would be quite a star author, since the subject which he helped to develop has become one of the most popular of all those to be found on bookshop shelves. How surprising is it then, to consider that Carnegie had such tremendous success in an epoch where a great many people would have had difficulty just coming to terms with his ideas, let alone embracing them. It seems simplistic to say that most of Carnegie's text is just plain common sense: it certainly is that. His prose is also delivered in an unequivocal fashion, but with humour. He knows what he's talking about, and he knows probably, that you or me or the next guy is going to be sceptical anyway. So he just tells it like he sees it and hopes the reader will catch the vision. Since he really hasn't got a hobbyhorse to ride, we do catch the drift (at least the millions of copies sold suggest that we do). I believe if you read this book and don't have a thoroughly enjoyable time (as you straighten out a lot of your own thinking), then it will only be because you need to come back to it in two or perhaps five years time. In addition to the above, let me say that Carnegie is also a fine writer, which helps. "
1723,Jesus,"It's a great book, for me it has five stars, the only thing is that in the final part I felt like it repeats the first parts, it could have been shorter and give you the same ideas."
1724,Ivana,This is a must-read book for all humans on the planet. And I recommend purchasing it so you can revisit the book yearly. It provides simple and practical advice based on common sense via elevated and highly entertaining prose. 
1725,Roxane Lapa,"I read this book when I was a young teenager and it changed my life. Decades later, it is still affecting the way I deal with people. This book is so old but the knowledge is timeless. Dale Carnegie was a social genius."
1726,Hugo Nascimento,"Provavelmente o melhor livro da minha vida.Já li, estou relendo e provavelmente o relerei por toda a minha vida."
1727,Shimron Trammell,I don't know why it took me this long to read this book. There are a lot of common sense concepts that everyone should know but we often forget. I really want to print out the lists and hang them where I can see them everyday to beat them into my head. Excellent read.
1728,Rakesh Ghumatkar,"It is a masterpiece, I read long back but still strongly feel the book is relevant today in the era of Social media, computers. This book was written when people were not even aware of internet, computer but basic principles are still relevant to this age."
1729,Sandy Geroux,"Obviously, Dale Carnegie is the master at this... and I still refer back to many stories and examples in his book on how to treat people with the respect they deserve. Incredible read!"
1730,Melissa Martin,"Read this book for work, amazing! I think everyone would benefit from this one. "
1731,Gunner,An understanding of how to relate to any type of person. I used this book understand how to motivate people. Easy book.....never quite finished it but I learned A LOT from it. 
1732,Scott Dinsmore,"A title like this could make a potential reader think one of two things. One is that they would not be caught dead reading a book as corny as this one sounds. Two is that they could not possibly afford to pass up a book that appears to contain so much value. I hope all of you think the latter when seeing this book on the shelf or on my site. How To Win Friends And Influence People is a classic, first written almost 70 years ago. This is as timeless as they come.Two good friends of mine turned me onto this book years ago and for that I am quite grateful. The book does an excellent job of getting one to see everyday actions in a completely different light. The funny thing is that after reading this book you may find yourself thinking that you’ve read it before. That is probably because you have been hearing these principles from your mother since before you can remember. My mother has been (and still is) an incredible teacher of how to act, how to treat, and how to most effectively deal with the people with whom I interact. She has been telling me these things for so long. When I was a child they did not have a chance of breaking through my rebellious shell. Thankfully that has since changed.It is such a shame that it often takes the words of someone famously successful to drive a point home. After reading this book I had Carnegie to thank for reminding me of these principles, but more importantly my mother to thank for ingraining them. If these books serve as nothing more than reminders of what one has already learned, then so be it. They serve just as great a purpose in that respect as they would in teaching you them for the first time.Let me give you an example of some of the principles that Carnegie brings to light. As I mentioned before, keep in mind that many are quite basic and common sense to most. Unfortunately common sense is not common practice.Smile. That is one principle. Most of us hopefully smile everyday, but do we ever take the time to think about a smile and the incredible power and effect it has on others? A smile can often be the single deciding factor between a deal being made and being broken. Neither party may consciously recognize it but it is true. Think about the way it feels next time you smile at someone or how about the next time someone smiles at you. It is one of the most powerful split-second actions in existence. We would be foolish not to take advantage of it.Here’s another principal: Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view. How basic is that? Too often do we get caught up in the heat of a discussion or argument that we do not take the few seconds or minutes to try to see the discussion from our opponent’s point of view. In fact it often becomes impossible once we get so emotionally involved in the argument. Next time you find yourself in a discussion with someone, try taking a moment to look at it through their eyes. You may be very surprised with what does and does not seem “obvious” from this person’s vantage point. Use those discoveries in your discussion and you will likely be surprised by the positive result.Another principal is, “give the person a fine reputation to live up to”. At first this may not seem like much, but have a look at it through this example. Someone in your office has a very important presentation to put together and present in the next few days. She needs help from someone in the office to make the workload manageable. You know you are confident with your presentation prep skills. She now confronts you and says, “I saw the incredible presentation you put together last week and I have heard that you are the best in the office at this. I could really use your help with mine. Would you mind?” Imagine the feeling of pride that hearing this would give you. You can bet that after hearing about your “reputation” you are going to be sure that you live up to it and help her to create an incredible presentation. A good reputation is something that every success-conscious person wants to live up to in their life. Think about that next time you need help.The final principal I want to mention is one that I feel has had the most powerful and positive effect on my life since reading it in this book. This principal is to always remember someone’s name. This is one of the biggest problems in our society. I certainly used to be 100% guilty of it. I would introduce myself to someone and be so focused on what I said that I did not even give myself a chance to hear their name. Whatever technique you find that works, it is vitally important that you remember that person’s name the first time you hear it. Few things feel better in this world than hearing your name (especially when it is from someone whom you did not expect to remember). One of the most powerful ways to build rapport with a person is to call him or her by their name right from the start. As I said earlier, it is often the small things that make the huge difference. Taking this one principal seriously and living it the rest of your life will undoubtedly have tremendous implications on your future success.Carnegie starts out this book by recommending how it should be read. He tells the reader to read through it once, and then do so again while highlighting key portions. Then read through the key portions every month or so to make sure that you are constantly living these principals. I picked this book up a number of years ago and I have since read through it countless times. I made an outline of the key principals and am sure to read through that every few months. As Stephen Covey says, “to know and not to do, is really not to know.” These life-changing principals will get you no where if you keep them locked up your mind. As with every other book that you read, you must make reality out of the knowledge you gain. It is that reality that will bring you your greatest success. Read, understand, live and apply every one of Dale Carnegie’s fundamental principals and your success will be unbelievable. Start today!"
1733,Alwyn Velasquez,I thought that this book has a lasting message and that is that if you invest in people at some point that invest will pay off. Ina society where its all about me its good to read a tome written in the 60’s that speaks about caring and investing in others.
1734,Shane,I will read this book many more times to come.
1735,Jay Kovach,One of my favorite books and authors!
1736,Mansoor,"This book really changed the way I interact with people. Its advice can be roughly summed up in one sentence: be geniunely interested in people. Despite the simplicity of its advice, it is still important to read. Through its advice and examples, readers can rediscover a skill that's mostly lost in these hurried times: listening."
1737,Javier,A book every person needs to read to learn how to deal with people better. Halfway through I book I got bored though.
1738,Dmitri Pavlov,"Read it many years ago, and Just read it again, picked up a few new points again. will come back to this masterpiece in a few years once again."
1739,R,"I have read this book multiple times and believe it is a must read for anyone going to school, looking for a job, trying to advance their career, or just want to create stronger relationships with those they will meet throughout their life. Easy to read chapters, and very practical advice to becoming a more likeable person."
1740,Matt Livermore,Everyone should read this book
1741,Frank Factora,How to Win Friends & Influence People is so timeless and valuable.. even in the digital age and modern age of social media. Success is always going to boil down to having skill in dealing with people. I only wish I could have read it sooner.. like in high school. =)
1742,Jessica Thelander,"Loved this book. I think one of my goals for 2016 might be to read more nonfiction books because I realized earlier this year that I'm lacking there. This Dale Carnegie book is a classic, and I figured that if it's been around for this long, it's got to have some advice worth listening to. I thought the advice laid out here was quite sound and sensible, and it was refreshing to hear instinctual truths laid out in such a straight-forward manner. The book is designed to provide advice on how to interact with people in order to get the answer that you want. The advice is accompanied by success stories to give you an idea about how to implement these values in your day-to-day life. I don't think readers will be particularly shocked by what Carnegie lays out, but I think much of the advice describes behaviors we don't always actively pursue. The value in Carnegie's book lies in its ability to make you take more purposeful action toward your goal, and it never hurts to have a reminder like that."
1743,Linda Sauve,"Wow. A must read for anyone, really. It is so intelligently writen just like a novel."
1744,Anupam Kumar,One of the best self help and personality development books I have ever read. I have seen the principles working. I highly recommend this book!
1745,Jharrison,Everyone should read this book. No need to reiterate what many others have said. Timeless!! 
1746,Patrick Terrio,"My favorite aspect of this book is its timelessness. The first edition written 3/4 of a century ago makes constant references to the ability of Lincoln, Roosevelt and other Presidents as the position requires more of a charismatic spark like no other in the modern world. Carnegie also writes about the teachings of Socrates and Aesop. Though thousands of years have passed, they ways to win friends and influence people has stayed the same."
1747,Marty Kaz,Still the StandardI read this book 25 years ago and read it again in 2015. It is surely one of the best books on influencing others ever written. 
1748,Caleb,Perfect explanation of common-sense social interaction
1749,Emilien Lebaudy,"This book really helped me to understand how to make social interaction work.It really changed my insight on relationships, at a moment of my life where I had many doubts about me and my interaction/communication skills. It truly influenced me and following the author's piece of advice is already improving my everyday life. I would recommend it to anyone!"
1750,Sheena,"This is a great book,especially for anyone in sales."
1751,Lisa Ryan,"Another classic. I took the Dale Carnegie course for the first time in 1987 and it changed my life. After taking this class, I knew that I wanted to become a professional inspirational/motivational speaker and be able to positively influence the world the way Dale Carnegie has done. This is a must-read.It is in the recommended reading section of my book, The Upside of Down Times: Discovering the Power of Gratitude which can be found here: http://amzn.to/NjNs06"
1752,Joel Katz,This book is a life changer.. It's a must read
1753,Peter,I will owe all my success to this book.
1754,Stefan Andrei,Totally recommended. One of the best books outhere 
1755,Diego,Amazing. Great read. Everyone should read this. It's a classic.
1756,Pat,"I'm looking forward to reading this book. Altho I've always been a people person, and find it easy to connect in ways that are meaningful for both myself and the other folks I connect with, I believe this book will take me to a new level. New to business, I know this will open new avenues and give me new tools. It comes highly recommended by Dani Johnson, who has set her own amazing standards of excellence in the business community."
1757,Richard,Great book. I'm reading it again (for the third time). This is one of those books that never gets old - you could make it an annual event to read this book.
1758,Abdualaziz,Good
1759,Jody,"Every human being should be required to read this book. I read it for a Dale Carnegie course I'm taking, and although some parts of it are a bit cheesy, it's all still totally applicable all theses years after Dale Carnegie wrote it."
1760,Bailey Coleman,"This book gives pointers and life lessons that help you to communicate with other people. It tells about how you can more easily handle people. This helps you to become more sucessful and have better realtionships. It says that someone that wants to be recognized for thier achicvements needs to have a true interest in other people. When yout truly interested in the other person, the other person feels important and wanted. They are more likly to enjoy your company. It also explains how each person in this world has a need almost as strong as hunger and that is the need to feel important, by giving someone that you are feeling their needs and buliding them up.This hasn't been made into a movie.I really liked this book. It has helped me so much in my realtionships in others. It has given me knowledge that I will use for the rest of my life. I like how the author describes each subject. Dale Carnegie is also able to thrown in some humor with every concept which made the book eaisier to get through and quiet entertaining."
1761,Inspiring Energy,"This book is a guide to life. I think several people should be required to read this book at least once. I loved this book and recommend everyone specially introverts like me. I struggle in social parties and to have friends. I applied the teaching of this book in one of social parties, and I loved the results.this book teaches us how to work with others and be nice. I truly believe my ability to effectively communicate and work with other people improved radically."
1762,Cheryl,Timeless advice. Fun to read.
1763,Michelle Ricciardo,"I read this book as a painfully shy teenager. I realized the simple truths of just looking people in the eye, smiling, and shaking their hand firmly for making a good first impression. Use someone's name to acknowledge that you remember them. When you treat people with respect and politeness, you can never go wrong. I moved back as an adult into the neighborhood where I had grown up. My mother's friends and our neighbors said to me, ""Do you know that you were different as a teenager? You were not the typical teenager. You looked me in the eyes when I spoke to you. You answered directly, and you were always polite."" I credit this book for those compliments."
1764,Susan Dooley,Incredible... A man before his time with a message that has no bounds.
1765,Chris Peterson,"The single most obvious and simple yet still fascinating insights from an author whom has truly stumbled upon some remarkable quirks of human interaction through his own experience. This allows him to very personally and very convincingly tell stories as examples of his points. His advice is very concise and eloquent; Many self-help books leave you with a long list of things that in my opinion simply amount to ""mental masterbation,"" that is to say feeling good about having gained much knowledge knowing that the knowledge in theory is actionable but is often too much far too much information that won't benefit the majority of readers as they won't know where to start. Dale Carnegie makes it very actionable and for that reason I have re-read this book once a year every year for the past 3 years. "
1766,Vinay,An extra ordinary book. It is a must read for everyone! 
1767,Michael Coletta,This is probably the most universally needed book ever written.
1768,Pranav Garg,Its an awesome book which tells one how to understand other's viewpoint and how we can approach what we want to say without getting in face of people. Giving options to people without making them sound that it's how we want it to be.
1769,Bimo Ario Tedjo,Wow! Membuat saya lebih berhati-hati dalam bersikap.
1770,Sheridan,FAVORITE BOOK. Very informative and has a lot of great points.
1771,Mindy,This book has completely changed my life. I am in awe at the nature of human beings and how we are all the same today as 100 years ago. I'm making Jakob read it and will definitely make my boys read it before college.
1772,Bryan Larsen,Amazing! Everyone should read this book.
1773,Harlen Bains,Very good book worth reading. Lots of important lessons. This book changes the way you communicate with other people and how your react to difficult situations. 
1774,Jenifer,"This Book I read some twenty years ago. This was such a good book that altogether changed my behavior. This is a book that must be included in school course. This teaches the reader to behave and find success. This book impacted much on my life and relations. I followed this book almost all the time.I gifted this book to several people during last twenty years. Surprising, none of them read and find its treasure. "
1775,Heidi,I read this about every year and am making my teens read it too..lol. 
1776,Rachel Wagner,Brilliant. I particularly love the '6 Ways to Make People Like You'. Amazing how it has stood up from 1936. Still feels remarkably relevant. 
1777,Ibukun,"Inspiring, socialization makes us human and as there different characters on the stage of life, one need guidance in dealing with specific characters. in man's selfish nature, he is to be a little selfless to be accepted and vice versa"
1778,Abraham,"OK, I know the title of this book is ridiculous. Honestly, I picked it up more with the expectation of laughing at it than actually getting something out of it.Boy was I wrong.The title of this book is by far the worst part. It was written in the 30s, so forgive it that. Once you get past the title, the principles that this book teaches are timeless and universal (at least, in my experience).Nothing in here will feel radically new to anyone who has had any sustained experience in dealing with people. I didn't learn anything ""new"" by reading this. HOWEVER (and this is a big ""however""), I absolutely needed to be explicitly reminded of the basic rules of how to deal with people in a way that benefits all and doesn't create animosity. Every day, my life is defined by thousands of small and big interactions with people. The choices I make in how to approach those interactions determine how I'm seen, understood, and treated by others. I know this, and yet every day, I do and say things that go against what I know about human nature. Why?Honestly, because it's difficult. It's tough to treat people with respect when they seem to demand ridicule and contempt. It's difficult to point out my own mistakes when someone else seems to have so many glaring ones themselves.And yet...Carnegie is right. You can't win an argument. You won't get what you want by criticism. There's always a price to pay for negativity. If you want to win, positivity is the only long-term way. And that's a lesson everyone can use.Ignore the ridiculous title, read the book, and push yourself to apply these principles that absolutely govern how we are treated and perceived in our social world. "
1779,Tamcamry,"It’s very seldom that something, anything can live up to the hype it gets or reputation it has from people who like a certain thing. This book is one of the few things that lives up to every bit of praise that has ever been given to it. This book literally puts every action or reaction that one should have in any given situation in business. It fills you in on the importance of things that may seem like common sense. Everybody knows if you deal with the public it’s good to smile, but this book tells you why. It gave me new insight into how important it is to learn and repeat peoples’ names back to them. It tells you how important things like approbation are when criticizing someone. There are so many different tips and tools that there really is no way I could possibly list them all in this report, but needless to say, this is an invaluable book that I will be happy to reread on numerous occasions."
1780,Bachir Z,nice book that put things into perpective for handeling people in the best way 
1781,Lindsay,"I think the title of this book is somewhat misleading as the casual passerby in the bookshop may think it's only for people with no social ability whatsoever. I found this was quite the contrary, and rather a guide for anyone looking to improve their social skills in a variety of settings from friendship, relationships, and in the workplace. Despite having been written in the 1930s, the skills taught and examples shared by Carnegie are still very relevant. "
1782,Mohsin Shaikh,"This is a timeless book . although this is a book for everyone, but if you are a manager , business owner or a sales person its a must read . this book will give you an idea on handling people , relations , prospective client , upset customers , juniors and giving you way to do thing which will make you win hearts. it will also open your eyes on many things which you did and thought them as right, it will tell you on your face on how wrong you were.most of the examples used here are still relevant and you could connect to most of them happening to you in day to day life. so don't wait grab a copy"
1783,Brett Cruickshank,Still holds true after all of these years. A must read for everyone.
1784,Jordan Lewis,"If more people followed the advice of this book, the world would be a much nicer place. Carnegie reinforced in me the need to show appreciation, sincerity, humility, and a positive attitude. It's prescriptions are less about controlling others and more about improving yourself.This book is highly anecdotal, but when you're Dale Carnegie and have personally helped thousands of people, your anecdote can carry plenty of weight.To me, there is more value in reading this book a second or third time than most books on sales or organizational management. So if you haven't read it once, what are you waiting for?"
1785,Leah Goldberg,A must read for anyone and everyone. Incredibly insightful into what it means to be human - why we act the way we act and how we can improve our interactions with others
1786,Ambra,"Un libro incredibile che aiuta ad aprire la mente e a vedere le cose sotto un'altra prospettiva. Qualunque sia l'ambito in cui si vogliono applicare i suoi principi (lavoro, famiglia, ecc...) al fine di migliorare sé stessi e le relazioni con gli altri, è in grado di trasmettere positività e la sensazione che tutto sia possibile.La grande qualità di questo libro lo posiziona indubbiamente tra i migliori libri di crescita personale."
1787,Ashok,"It is a really nice book, because i read it more than 4 times :P. It teaches you how to be kind to people even though youare completely different. Dale Carnegie has a lot of information and knows how to explain well. He tells about nobody thinks about you, you have to think about others inorder to make them to do your work!!Excellent for marketing guys and everybody!!"
1788,Alkan Öztürk,"Nothing to critique on this book. Definitely a must-read on relationships. Business, family, love... All those strategies can be implemented in all the areas in life. Specifically, if it's business relationships that you want to improve, I would recommend reading this book with Never Eat Alone by Keith F.  "
1789,Bishop,I have just finished this book. It is great and a lot of good info.
1790,Matthew Johnson,I must for anyone who plans to talk to other people.
1791,Santos,"Excellent book on how to make your friends, business partners, and subordinates like you. If you lead people, it will help provide you some simple good tips to be liked by your group."
1792,Ian,Interesting review of human motives and how common sense goes a long way.
1793,Ricardo Monagas,Good book! Nice perspective to build better human relationships.
1794,gina  al ilmi,really blaze my social life to a higher level
1795,Shima,لقد قرات هذا الكتاب مت قبل مرتين وهو كتاب جيد تشعر معه بصدق التجارب وفعلاجربت الكثير من المواقف ولكن علاقتنا بالناس وكسب الأصدقاء تحتاج الى الصبر والحكمهوحب الناس بصدق أضاف الكتاب الى ولكن ليس كثيرا فمعظم المبادئ والأفكار تعلمتها من حبيبي ومعلمي رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلم ولكن ديل كارنيجي يستحق الشكر والثناء على هذا العمل
1796,Cordell,"Very good. Its one of those self help books that inspires. Every word rings true and as you read it you think to yourself, yah thats right but I already knew that, but its all here in one place."
1797,Timothy Smith,"If you are in any business, or want to know more about yourself, and other people, This is a must read. More like a book you'll want to read year after year."
1798,Leyendecker1874,Excellent. I took notes and also underlined certain passages. I'm glad I own this book as I plan to re-read it.
1799,Sarah alhussinan ✨,I needed this. I needed a great 2015 reading ending with an extraordinary book like this ..
1800,Vanessa,"Even though this book was written a while ago, the principles still apply today. I've even tried applying them in my life already! Excellent read."
1801,Coco Prato,I love this book! It's so simple and so straightforward. Everyone needs to read it. 
1802,Jill,"I know the title, but this has helped me more in mothering than many parenting books. That alone made it worth the purchase price. "
1803,Odanga Madung,This is one of those books I'd buy in crates and hand out to every single person who comes to see me. I had seen the book everywhere and mistook it to be one of those get rich quick books that led people astray. I was wrong. The book is profound. The book is a powerful take on what it takes to get by in this world. Whether we like it or not our number one job is to work with people and they are the one constant in our lives. I am truly impressed by the timeless principles of this book and intend to read it again in the near future.
1804,Jacob,hi
1805,Domagoj Franc,Greate book helped me alot in my Life
1806,J.t.,"I know it's an oldie, but it is a goldie! Easy to read. Taught me a lot about myself and the world around me. Definitely gives you food for thought."
1807,Brittany,"Very well written, the examples are a bit outdated but still serve the purpose. I would love to see a re-write of this book, using more current examples."
1808,Kaumal,"This is the most amazing non-fiction book I have ever read. No doubt about it.I am heading to college this year and I'm so glad that I read this unlike many others who wouldn't even know about this gem of a book!No wonder it has been around for decades - its principles are still as important now as when Carnegie first wrote them. If everyone in the world had read this book, we would have peace in all countries. Human suffering would be cut down by an immeasurable amount. If you think of it, most of the times that we've been upset is due to someone else's mishandling of a situation. This book changes all that.I know how many times this might have been said, but this is a book that can really change the course of lives. It really creates a 'new you' and once planted, Carnegie's ideas won't leave your mind. His words will be reverberating in your head all the time, and trust me, that's a hell of a good thing. I don't know how much more of a higher recommendation I could give this book. Basically, if you want to live an amazing life, read this. And quick."
1809,Bernie Walsh,Written earlier in the last century but the stories still show relevance in how the principles relate to human relationships.
1810,Michael Nvety,This is a great book. I view it a guide to succeed in my work enviroment. I highly recommend it.
1811,Maria Stancheva,"Страхотна! Карнеги - преди и след, две вселени. "
1812,Jim Peters,"Everyone should read this book. Dozens of simple persuasion tips for everyday living. Great illustrations of why alternative self-centered approaches (which most people use all the time (including, before reading the book, me)) are counter-productive."
1813,Remo Uherek,"Deep and rich book about how to deal with people, despite the quite shallow title. Showed me how 30 simple – but certainly not always easily applicable – principles can minimize my conflicts, enrich my relationships and generally make me a happier, more peaceful human being. The book is filled with a vast collection of valuable case studies and examples. This book is my reference whenever I encounter a difficult relationship that requires skillful communication."
1814,Razia,A must read for everybody. I can definitely feel a difference in interacting with people and getting a positive response from them.
1815,Paula,It was one of my first book when I starded to built the bussines. I was shy and this book help me in relationship at work and at home! I recommerd it!
1816,Alex Mou,Read long time ago and recommend it frequently to friends I know. A great little book that changed my understanding of people. Had a great impact on my dealing with people. A master piece. It's a must-read for anyone who wants to understand America where this book has become part of its folklore. 
1817,Mike Koch,"The title doesn't do it justice. I was half expecting some slime-ball manual of how to fake being a sympathetic person. On the contrary, this is a classic. Its message is that if you want to do well with people, you'd better become interested and considerate and pleasant to be around. The book tells you how, over and over, with principles and examples and anecdotes. The phrase ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" was probably coined in reference to this book. Although I admit the book's title is overly aggressive, anyone wishing to learn more about the nature of human relations will love this."
1818,Bernardine,"An amazing book and a definite must read for individuals in the corporate world and those willing to join. Most of the principles if not all, that have been cited by Carnegie are terrific. They are not principles that have merely been stated to make the book seem fancy. But here are some techniques that can actually be put to practice in daily life - and that's the most amazing part.What I liked about the book:The fact that you can actually make an effort to practice the principles mentioned in the book.What I disliked about the book:Too many examples have been cited for every principle. For somebody like me, who hates books with a lot of pages - too many examples would just get me irritated.Total rating: 8.0 - 8.5 on 10"
1819,Marlon Katsigazi,An excellent book for improving relationships with people to increase success in all facets of life.
1820,M.L.,"There's a reason this is a classic, and if you're going to read persuasion and influence books, this is a great place to start. It's practical and not scientific, the way most pop-sci books are today. There aren't worksheets or quizzes -- simply anecdotes, well-written, from which the reader is free to take what he/she may."
1821,Samantha Justine R. Zamora,"Everything I read I didn't realize I was already learning from my mother.My mom is a branch manager in one of the most well known Insurance companies. She's managed her people very well and have managed conflicts and challenging situations with such professionalism. I am about to start my own business and being the introvert that I am I thought I needed extra help to learn how to influence people. After finishing the book, I just realized that everything I read I was already learning from my mother. I just didn't realize it before because there was no specific blueprint to how she does things to become such an influential manager. This book explains everything and I can't wait to practice everything I've learned here."
1822,Suzy Vandyke,My #1 recommended book to read!
1823,Mark Thompson,"Started applying many of the subjects to my every day life. Found myself smiling more, engaging more, complementing more, looking for positives in everything, listening more, listening before speaking, more comfortable speaking in front of groups, and overall enjoying life more. I will definitely read it again. "
1824,Rylan Perrott,Highly recommend it very practical and easy to follow.
1825,Angie Guarnieri,Leadership 101...a must read for a anyone who wants to be successful in business!
1826,Tony Wong,Great book for the 20 something.
1827,Kristin Hindenach,"I use this DAILY!(completmenting others, asking questions about them, and getting them to hear you out!)GREATEST WAY TO AVOID AN ARGUMENT!"
1828,Ahmed Hagagović,واحد من اجمل واروع الكتب اللى قراتها ف حياتى الكتاب دا مش يعنى ازاى تكسب اصدقاء الكتاب دا يعنى ازاى تعيش حياة مليانة راحة نفسية شابووووووو لديل كارنيجى بجد 
1829,Hawley,"Really well expressed with clear examples, this book looks at human interaction and helps one to be more humble and thoughtful to bring about better interaction and relationships. Very good and a pleasant read - though I take that it may be hard to live out the values it expresses as much as I'd like!ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. I hope to continue reading and re-reading this for years..."
1830,Maggie,Everyone should read this book. Highly highly recommend this.
1831,Barbara Lovejoy,The principles in this book originally written in 1936 are just as important today. I'd read this book a number of years ago and found it wise to read it again. Now to apply it!
1832,Larry Ortman,Should be required reading for everyone. Valuable insight into understanding and getting along with people. If you read this book and practice the principles inside it's guaranteed to improve your relations with everyone. 
1833,Bridgette,"Great book! Helps you be a good friend. It was writen back in the days, (aka...my grandpa read it in college) Each chapter addresses a different issue when dealing with people."
1834,Keli Wright,I was hesitant to know if I should give this four or five stars.. I used the same adjectives a lot..and it got a bit repetitive..but something like this you need to repeat a lot. I found this on my boss Mike's bookshelf and decided to read it. My friend Kathy's son Dan told me to read it years ago .. and I am just getting aroung to it.. it was a real eye-opener and I think that everyone should read it and if I ever see it at the thrift store I am going to buy it. I think that it also helped me from getting in an argument with the guy I have been going sorta dating.. because before I said something I thought about what I had been reading and decided to say it different. So I am very grateful that I read it and it has a lot of good ideas of how we can say things to people.
1835,Hrag Saatjian,There is a reason people still read this book and recommend it almost 100 years after its first publication.
1836,Pratap,"A must read. No matter who you are what your field, or goal is, everyone should read this book asap."
1837,Tobias Desomer,So simple and so easily forgotten. One of those books to re-read every year.
1838,Lily,I bought this book in its original print at 12 years old at a garage sale for 10 cents. That dime spent changed my life!!! This book made my High School career AMAZING simply by following the advise contained within. I recommend this book to EVERYONE!!!
1839,Yong Yi,"I confess that I have previously thought of this book as a guidebook on manipulation. Then I started reading it and soon discovered how wrong that thinking was. To be sure, some malicious types would use the principles of this book to manipulate others to their own ends. Yet the heart of this book is centred on improving one's intra-personal manner and fostering strong, mutually beneficial relationships in both business and home life. The principles expounded in this book are backed up by a well-researched litany of anecdotal evidence. Sure, the principles come across as obvious and common sense. But this book reminds us that common sense is at times (possibly due to pride, ego, or insecurity) not as common as one would think. "
1840,Maiko,"At my first reading, I thought Dale Carnegie might have had a serious psychological problem with human relationship in his young age. Because his point of view in the book is filled with irony, and I believe he was a misanthropic. He defined people as emotional creatures like animals. He seemed to think human is foolish all in all, and have to manupulate the power for himself in a good way to servive in the cruel world. I read the reviews of other's Goodreads review, and some people felt exact the same like me. ""Dale Carnegie told us how to manipulate people, and it's not How to win friends"". But I think Dale Carnegie is not a bad person because he opened his mind in his own book even he believes human is foolish. He put us all cards on the table, which means he trusted people in a some way. I imagine he faced to some relationship problems and desperated human.Maybe, he put wrong title on the book. ""Friends"" is not ""Friends"" most people think for him. Some reviewers would feel weird ""Friends"" things. Most people think ""Friends"" are not thing to make use of.He should put the title ""Listen to everything people want to say, and you can make enemies help you like a friend"" -- or something like that. In Japan, the title ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" is not adopted, I got the book title like ""How to motivate people"". So, I can see just few negative reviews in Japanese book market. Dale Carnegie's method of motivating people is however useful except his irony to human. So I gave 5 stars! "
1841,Christiana Hadji,"If you're planning on reading only one psychology book in your life, you better make it this one. "
1842,stickytacky,strongly recommended. a great read.
1843,MJ Hoffman,"Simply put, the greatest book on sales ever written. Sublime and powerful - worth reading every year."
1844,Nora Habibur,Fantastic!!! Read it when i was a teenager n it changed my life!!! I've read it more than a dozen times!
1845,Alexis Smith,"Great guide to human relations, a very profitable asset. Easy read with tons of examples. Suggest highlighting key points within chapters."
1846,Clay Teller,A book everyone should own.
1847,Sandra,Smile! always smile and ever try to win an argument cause u lose it!!!
1848,Kevin Conde,"Fascinating, provides great ideas for improving interpersonal relations. "
1849,Sean Grimm,One of the most impactful books I have ever read. 
1850,Abdullah Altammami,رائع و الأفضل في مجاله من الكتب التي يجب ان تقرأها أكثر من مره 
1851,David Tran,Re-read on Audiobook and loved it again!
1852,Jamie Wall,Fantastic and insightful. Standard reading in this genre.
1853,Kathrynn,"I love this book! My copy is from 1964 and yellowed, but one of my dearest books. I think reading this book was a life-changing event for me. A must read for every human being!"
1854,Awen Finn,Fantastic book with timeless wisdom. 
1855,Lynda,"A book I go back to over and over. Yes, it is old, and yes it is anecdotal, but it is one of the best and most helpful books I have ever read."
1856,Vicki,"Read this book many many years ago, but still benefit from the lessons. It helped me work through business and personal issues. I read it during the time of my marriage to Essi after only knowing him for 6 weeks. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!"
1857,Phil Clamp,Great book. One of those that should probably be read year on year to reinforce the principles.
1858,Jonas N.,It was a good book I read it a long time ago. I gave to my ex-wife as a gift for her birthday.
1859,Puja Gupta,Truly amazing a must read for all even those who don't read.
1860,Adrik,I'm always sceptical about reading such works- mainly because it’s difficult to admit I would need help in the socialising department- but this book is well worth a read! 
1861,Ivica,"One of the best books I've read.Dale was/would be one of a hell copywriter. He makes you to read this piece of art without leaving book at all.And yeah, he gives you some great timeless advice.If you work in sales/marketing this should be on your shelves. If you want to be nicer person get it. If you want to improve your communication with other, then... This book should be on your shelves.Get it to understand how some people could get something from you by acting nice in specific way or saying some nice words. With this knowledge you can avoid being manipulated in so many occasions."
1862,Prakhar,A book every one should read! 
1863,Michael Johnson,This book changed the way I manage people.
1864,Jillian,"Great advice. While I've read most of this information in other books or magazines before, I love the way that the author puts things. Example: ""Criticisms are like homing pigeons. They always return back."""
1865,Cortleigh,"I always heard that this was one of those books that ""everyone NEEDS to read,"" but by it's title I was never very interested. I'm so glad I finally picked it up after I found a 1960s copy in a large lot of books I purchased. Fascinating study of people, relationships and how essentially we are all the same. I will read this again one day and I will make sure my children read it. I recommend this book to anyone who talks, interacts in any way with other people :-P . "
1866,Uso Sayers,"Love this book. It has tidbits for all aspects of life - leadership, parenting, friendships...."
1867,Rusty,A bench mark in human relations. This should be part of everybody's educational curriculum as they move through life.
1868,Christopher Weaver,Excellent book. 
1869,Ashwani Sharma,Absolutely brilliant... One of my favourite books .... 
1870,Elian Ciptono,I personally really like this book
1871,Jeanne Soileau,This is a very good read.This is a very good book. It is informative and motivational. The stories are interesting and encouraging and keeps your attention. 
1872,Ammar,"The book raises useful hints on how to deal with people. As a reader, you would realize that all principles are rational and logic, hence you need to keep them all listed to refresh your memory with. I like various hints such as:Persons name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely. When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.Distrust your first instinctive impression.Show respect for other people opinions, never say you are wrong.This is a good book to start with to win you friends and influence people and finally be a good leader."
1873,Augusto,"I really liked this book. Unfortunately, the title kept me away from it for a long time, as it sounds more like how to manipulate people rather than /the way to win friends and influence people is to be honest and humble/."
1874,Hillary Garner,"One of those ...""an oldie but a goodie!"" My Grandma gave me her old worn copy of this one and said that besides the scriptures this book influenced her the most. One to read and read again!"
1875,Robin Filipczak,An excellent update to Carnegie's powerful principles...distilled in an manageable packet for teens.
1876,Megan Campbell,"Brilliant, Loved it! Highly recommend to everyone!!"
1877,Kalobw,"Great book for anyone in any walk of life, not just the business world."
1878,Ashley,You would be a fool not to read this book. It has changed the way I think about life. 
1879,Brendan Hall,Excellent read recommended to me by a college friend. Helped me to improve my conversation skills and become a better listener. Would highly recommend.
1880,TQM Doctor,This is a book I always need to return to. Provides the basic rules and concepts for successful interpersonal relationships. A fantastic book!
1881,Lowell,"Just read this for the second time. I consider everything discussed in this book to be common sense for society. Regardless of the examples stemming from the 1930's, the principles are so essential for general interaction. And considering how socially retarded we all are today (in varying degrees), this book is even more important with every passing year.My only qualm about this book: the title. It is misleading. It gives the impression (to me) of a book that is one of the repulsive ""can-do"",""reach-for-the-stars"" rubbish literature that is so widespread. Had Carnegie made the title something like ""How to Be a Civilized Person"" would have been more effective... but even that title (apart from being lame) doesn't do it justice. "
1882,Wildwind,Must read book
1883,Troy Gregory,The language and anecdotes are dated but the pages are practically worth their weight in gold. This book is full of sage advice that would move anyone forward in life. I'll probably re-read this book once a year to keep me out of mental ruts at work.
1884,Jalem,"The best productivity book I've read till now.The way the author puts forward the gist, through ""been there, done that"" examples in just too good. Makes you just sail through the pages with delight.Been using these principles in life too. Believe me, they do work wonders :)"
1885,Trevor Price,"Ok, so cheesy title and salesmanship in the introduction aside, this book wasn't at all slimy or cynical. ""The principles of this book will only work if they come from the heart. I'm not advocating a bag of tricks,"" the author stresses. The 1930s language is charmingly old school once you get used to it.None of these principles are really groundbreaking revelations; people skilled in human interaction are probably doing most or even all of them already. However, this book is inspiring and left me confident that I have lots of improvements to make in how I deal with family, friends, and co-workers, and that knowing the path is different from walking the path."
1886,Mahmoud Atta,أقتنى نسخة الولد التى اقتناها فى أواخر الستيناتمن أروع الكتب التى ساعدتنى كثيراً فى أكتساب مهارات أجتماعية فى بداية حياتىومازلت أذكر منه بعد العناوين الرئيسية والقصص الشيقةأنصح بقراءته
1887,Danny Verpoorten,Brilliant book. Must read for everyone.
1888,carl caesar,"Warren Buffett dijo de Dale Carnegie que le cambió la vida.Así que quien soy yo para negarlo. Creo que este libro, entre todos los libros que tiene Dale Carnegie son libros que deberían ser de lectura obligada en la educación pública.El libro nos muestra las facetas más básicas de la ingeniería social, o dicho de otro modo. Como ser educado y entenderse con los demás.Pese a que el libro se tiende a mover mucho en el ámbito empresarial y comercial, creo que es un libro muy válido para todo el mundo, ya que todos, en un momento u otro, necesitamos explicarnos de la forma más adecuada posible para que otro los entienda y además no solo consigamos de él lo que nosotros necesitamos, si no que podríamos incluso conseguir que él quiera que nosotros consigamos lo que queremos.Los conceptos escritos en este libro son realmente fáciles y simples. Se pueden asimilar sin mucho problema, y podemos incluso llegar a darnos cuenta de lo importante que son ciertos hábitos que en muchas veces hemos olvidado.El libro además explica como se debería leer según Dale Carnegie. Ya que este nos propone el leer un capítulo. Dejarlo madurar. Y volverlo a leer al día siguiente y si se quiere, otro capítulo más. Y seguir con la rueda de dejarlo madurar y leer todos los capítulos dos veces, para asimilar los conceptos. Yo lo he leído de esta forma y me ha parecido una idea interesante, con una segunda lectura se sacan impresiones diferentes. Lo malo de leerlo de esta forma es que se tarda más de leer de lo previsto, pero merece la pena.Conclusión:Este es un libro que debería leer todo el mundo. "
1889,Christy,I can honestly say that EVERYONE (yes YOU) needs to read this book. Just using the basic principals within my own family is making a world of difference. This is a book to read over and over and over again. I'd give it 6 stars if I could!
1890,Ettienne De Beer,A MUST HAVE in every personal library across the world. Powerful philosophy. 
1891,Marcus,"So many tips. The book suggests you read each chapter twice. Well I made sure I did, and I know I got a lot more from it for that! The book gives you several short tips, then a 5-10 minute chapter explaining that tip. Write those tips down and the entire book will stick! Definitely something I plan on reading again someday!"
1892,Daren Eiri,Anyone who works with others and wants to improve their relationship with their colleagues (or even friends/family) should read this. 
1893,Tom Gagne,"My favorite lesson from this book, the one that has stuck with me for years, is how to listen to people. You have to be genuinely interested in what they're saying.In social settings this is especially valuable. Everyone we meet is better than me at something, or knows more about something than I do, and it's my job to find out what it is. It serves two purposes; first, people enjoy talking about themselves; second, I learn something; and last, it's easier to listen to others with genuine interest in what they're saying when what they're talking about is interesting to both them and you."
1894,Joe McPlumber,"My father gave me this book in my early teens, it was given him by his father. It's a very, very tired old paperback. I can't read it anymore for fear of it falling to bits but that's OK since i've got it on my Nook.This is the great-grandaddy of all self-help books, which i find ironic since its focus is on how we treat other people. I hate to make sweeping generalizations but it seems to me that our culture of individuality tends to put the focus on self, and self-interest at the expense of others. Hence, the irony of this book is to inform us in no uncertain terms that our self-interest is inextricably entwined with the interests of others. So if we want others to like us, we want them to do what we want them to do, and we want to be happy, then we need to like other people, do what they want us to do, and see to their happiness.In very rough terms, this book is an elaboration on the Golden Rule. Except it doesn't stop with pithy aphorisms but goes into detail about how others want to be treated, and why. It often illustrates points by describing how you, yourself, want to be treated, and you may be surprised to discover how much you didn't know about that. If i have any criticism of this book it might be for its title, which seems unfortunately cynical from a superficial perspective. But on the other hand it may be a brilliant title because anyone who picks up this book purely for its manipulative potential is going to quickly discover that it simply doesn't work in the absence of sincerity and authenticity. So there's the potential for turning a manipulative person into a sincere one, by means of appealing to his self-interest. Oh, the irony..."
1895,Ahmad Nazeri,One of the best books ever! A life changing read for me and highly recommended!
1896,Danni,This is one of the best books I have ever read. I will be taking some notes before it goes back to the library. My mom has been recommending it for years I am glad I finally picked it up.
1897,Thomas Cannon,I read Dale Carnegie when I was in my teens. His books are life changing and give you a fresh perspective on life.
1898,Marcus Mullins,Must read for anybody aspiring to do anything positive in life. Best book on how to communicate with others.
1899,John Mellody,The focus on Abraham lincoln's approach to difficult people was especially helpful. 
1900,Hadi Mohamad,يمكن ترتيب بعض الانفعالات عبر الاستنباط من هذا الكتاب الجميللاسيما ان كانت امقارنه فى بعض الملاحظات تبدأها بالنفس اولا 
1901,Lizzie Jones,"This book is brilliant. Honestly one of the best I've read. I think everyone should read this, perhaps multiple times. I know I've heard the name tossed around for years but I'm so glad I actually sat down and read it. Actually, I plowed through it. It was fascinating, applicable, and has already helped me reconsider my approach to certain people and situations. An absolute must-read."
1902,Ron Shore,Wonderful book! It gives a great deal of insight as to how everyone can become a better listener and friend.
1903,Trisha,"A wonderful book! I think I had let the title stop me from reading it for so many years from fear of manipulation. Silly. This is a great guide into how individuals like to be treated and why, and how we can keep these ideas in mind when interacting with others. I don't buy many books. After reading this one via the public library, I bought myself a copy!"
1904,Manish Chetani,"Even if the book was published long ago the psychology and philosophy of basic human nature and wants remains the same, which has been taken out very beautifully by the author. A recommended read for all."
1905,Esraa Swillam,"must read, life changing book"
1906,Deehan,"you would say..""yes ofcourse""..""sheesh, its not sumthing new for me at all""..and yet, you're not doing it!..Dale Carnegie put the ways of influencing arent really like telling you what to do, but with such interesting story..The moment i read this, i said ""please god, just lemme be the only one whoever read this book.."" hehehe"
1907,April3lue,"My mother has been telling me about this book ever since I was a little kid. She said that my father's mother had read and recommended this book to her but it was banned in their home country at the time. I suddenly remembered to search for it today...and so far, the first chapter is amazing! Definitely in the best interest for ppl of all ages! I know I'll be buying my kids a copy when they reach high school! :)"
1908,Valenfore Alestreneon,A staple for any business owners or corporate professions which require that you deal with people a lot. 
1909,Ahmad Maqram,قرأته 3 مرات وفي كل مرة أجد شيئا جديدا يوافق تغيرات العمر والمكانة 
1910,Aras Atasaygın,"So obvious that you think it will not work, and it works like a charm! This book not only radiates positivity for your inner self but also to the people around you. A great read for me, and hopefully for you as well."
1911,Haje,"An absolute classic, and I think a must-read for all people. It's mostly common sense, but by golly is is well-articulated common sense that might make you think about the way you run your life. Wonderful stuff. "
1912,Jacopo,"Mi sono accorto di non avere scritto una recensione di questo libro, quindi rimedio subito perché lo ritengo uno dei libri che più ha influito sul mio modo di essere.Titolo orrendo (sia in Inglese, che in Italiano), per un libro la cui lettura ritengo essenziale per qualsiasi persona. Di fatto è un manuale di comportamento, l'autore in ogni capitolo descrive un' ""abilità"" che sarebbe utile sviluppare per trarre il meglio dalle interazioni tra le persone. Lo stile è estremamente scorrevole, a volte colloquiale, si ha l'impressione di ascoltare le parole di un saggio anziano che racconta aneddoti riguardanti numerosi personaggi del passato come se fossero suoi amici di vecchia data per supportare le proprie tesi. Tesi che, alla fine di ogni capitolo, sono sintetizzati sotto forma di regole, di ""comandamenti"".Molto interessante è la premessa dell'autore, che invita ad incorporare nelle proprie abitudini i consigli elargiti. Il libro va letto lentamente, meditando, sottolineando, glossando e provando a mettere in pratica gli insegnamenti settimana dopo settimana. Non è un volume da leggere e poi riporre in libreria e dimenticarsene, bensì va costantemente tenuto a portata di mano e va riletto, di tanto in tanto, per rinfrescare la memoria. Per questi motivi consiglio di possedere un edizione fisica, non una versione ebook.Leggetelo e spargete la voce, mi raccomando."
1913,Felipe Gonzalez,"Es increible que luegomd etantos años, este libro siga teniendo la misma ( o incluso mas) vigencia que cuando se escribio. Siempre lo recomiendo, el lbro no cntiene mas que enseñanzas practicas y utiles en la vida laboral y personal."
1914,J. Best,"Great book. The granddaddy of all self-development books, up there with Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. The info in here has been adopted by virtually every other life coach or self-help guru, but its good to go back to the source. It never felt dated to me, but rather that info here is timeless. "
1915,Richieandmona,"Although the book teaches principals we, this day in age, have heard before, reviewing such important life skills is incredibly invaluable. It's one of the best reminders I have read in how to relate to others. Its a book I intend to read and review throughout my life, and I'd highly recommend others do the same. It should be a part of everyone's book collection. The world would undoubtedly be a better place for it."
1916,Sridhar Jammalamadaka,Great book for introverts! :-)
1917,Anirudh,Very insightful!!The book has justified the author's acclaim and is definitely worth a read. 
1918,Timothy Fitzwilliams,This book changed my life forever.
1919,Udaykumar Thakare,Hello
1920,Denise Henry,"This book should be a must read for anyone in leadership or who aspires to be in leadership. I have seen far too many managers/directors/vice presidents/etc. in my career where bullying is a daily occurrence and fear is used as a motivator. This book is old, but the advice is gold and will help you grow in not only your professional life but in your personal relationships as well."
1921,Yaymed,Ageless advice on treating people with respect and how you would want to be treated
1922,Rhonda D,I loved this book. It talked about manors we learner as kids but have gone out of practice. Simple things you can do to communicate successfully with people.
1923,Jose Belalcazar,"Really interesting, full of examples and very precise.PD: Tips have really worked for me"
1924,Mai Mazoku,"It's a great book. After reading Dale's 'how to stop worrying' it's a bit disappointing at first, because he says same things, but further I read more useful info I got. It doesn't teach how to manipulate people (I find title quite inappropriate), it helps not to stress because of them and don't be discouraged to communicate. And most importantly it teaches how to be kind, don't have negative feelings towards others, resolve conflicts and be humble."
1925,Du Nguyen,"An excellent book and the precursor to self-help books. Dale Carnegie's book is filled to the brim with great tips and advice to become a person with better interpersonal skills.The book itself is easily read and Carnegie favors clarity to tell what you should do to become more liked but also why. The strength of the book is clearly in the many examples and anecdotes of people who have used the advice to great effect.Some of the tips or ""principles"" as they are known as in the book however do overlap each other and by carefully reading you can glimpse many insights of human nature.Overall a great book and if everybody read this I am sure the world would be headed to a better place."
1926,Kelsey Kacher,"I think about this book nearly every time I interact with someone (whether consciously or not). I've never forgotten its simple principle of CASH: Care about the person you're talking to, Ask questions about them, Smile genuinely, and Help whenever you can. I'm not good at this, but I work on it all the time because I know it is so effective in not only helping you ""influence people,"" but in being a happier person. Fabulous book."
1927,Jason Riemens,"THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVOTITE BOOK OF ALL TIME! This book has helped me through relationship problems, work problems, and has made me a better person overall. It discusses the fundamental techniques in handing people, how to win people to your way of thinking, ways to make people like you, and how to be a leader. It is all common sense, but as we all know, common sense is not always common practice. It is not a business book, a relationship book, or a self-help book. It is a life book - my life has been changed forever by it - and hopefully I have helped others improve their lives because of it as well. I have this book many times and listened to the audiobook many times. "
1928,Carrie,I love this book and have read it several times.
1929,Mary Lou,Fantastic yet amazingly simple concepts....should be required reading for high school and college.
1930,Wijayanto,"It is kind of a tips book, according to the way he wrote, it is also easy to be understood. You will even know the inside only by reading the page of contents. He divided it into 4 big chapters. The first one is “Teknik-Teknik Dasar Dalam Menangani Manusia”. “Enam Cara Untuk Membuat Orang Lain Menyukai Anda” is the next chapter, and it is followed by “Bagaimana Memikat Orang Lain Mengkuti Cara Berpikir Anda”, and the last one is “Jadilah Pemimpin: Bagaimana Mengubah Orang Lain Tanpa Menyinggung atau Membangkitkan Kemarahan”. Sorry for not changed it into English, I am just afraid to ruin the ori version.Plenty stories which were written there were based on his class experiences, as he told. Other stories came from his research about some well-known people at his era. No wonder, some of stories leaving its good impressions in my mind. It gives some points that we could believe if the tips are really working in our daily life, and seems its work forever just like the way he convinced it to the reader. Even somehow, I felt boring with it’s monotony plot. He depicted problems, giving some succeeded samples to overcome the problems, and ended it with a conclusion. That is the right plot for sure, and that is how an article should be written, perhaps. I mean, it will be more interesting -at least for me- if he could plays with the plot. Or, maybe it because of me who is quick to get bored of anything.Overall, this book is great. It helps to realize if we, human beings, need to get appreciation, love to have attention from others, selfish, conceited, arrogant, and so on. He said those matters as basic human behavior. The tips he gave are about how to handle those behavior whenever we meet to treat people. The easiest way, from which I concluded, is to treat them as the way you treat yourself. What will suit you, probably, suit them either. What you dislike, perhaps, they do also."
1931,Cayla,"This book is fantastic! The book is filled with expert advice on how to deal with people. I think what made it so great was that it wasn't filled with tricks, but emphasized that you need to be genuine. It talks of complimenting people, but reminds the reader that people can see through empty flattery. For example, it discusses the technique of complimenting a person before mentioning a flaw or mistake, but then it provides the additional advice that so many people forget - if the compliment is general and fake, and is quickly followed by a ""but"" it was worthless. It states that the book provides a new way of thinking - a way that appreciates people, sees their value, and looks at situations from the other person's perspective. In discussing techniques in making business deals, it emphasizes that the deal should be beneficial to both parties. The book isn't about manipulating people, but just understanding people and treating them better - which inspires friendship and better work. One of my favorite parts of the book were the examples provided of people using the techniques and how that improved various situations. Altogether, this is a great book. I plan to read the book again and think it's a must-read for anyone who works with people...or otherwise ever has human contact!"
1932,Edgar Perez,The best book on socializingThe best book on socializingthis is pretty much the essential self help book their is. being social is critical in our everyday life. let this be the guide for everyone looking to improve your disk skills. 
1933,Trevauhn Grant,"This book is amazing. It really looks at one of the most important aspects of human nature: the need to feel important. The author doesn't simply exploit this need, yet he takes it and shows how humility on your part can play a powerful role in empowering another person. This book is not the kind of book with a simple plan and execution scheme, yet it deals with growth and maturity. It lays out ideals which one must aspire to be through patience, humility, keeping a calm head, and allowing the other person to feel as important as they are."
1934,Jason Zhang,confucius would be more comprehensive
1935,Dhandapany Venkatasubramanian,A book every manager should read. They would become better at handling people and have more friendly team.
1936,Andy Westbrook,"Great Book, I read the Digital Age version and it contained a lot of pertinent information that everybody need to remember. It reminds me how far caring for people and just smiling can go. "
1937,Edo Yavino,"Buku ini mengajarkan saya bagaimana cara hidup yang baik dalam masyarakat, dengan keluarga, teman, rekan kerja dan tetangga. Semua orang harus mempraktekan saran yang ada di buku ini. Setiap anak sekolah harus menjadikan buku ini bacaan wajib."
1938,Tim Martin,"I've read this book many, many times and will pick it up again many, many more. This was the 2013 reading and it's relevant every day if you ever come into contact with other humans."
1939,Rachelle Gemme,"If you are a person with introvert personality, and afraid of peers, this book is good for you. The book will teach you how to talk to your peers and get out of your shelve."

1942,Saqib Khan,Masterpiece. Timeless.
1943,Matas,"This book covers all the principals that are foundational for interacting with other people, fantastic content and examples. Second re-read."
1944,Jonathan,It changed how I communicate with people. 
1945,Suz,This book is very interesting and applicable to every day life. A lot of what it has to say is common sense... I would recommend it. I love self help books :)
1946,Igor Duvnjak,"I like this book because of the way it was written. It's fun to read, there are lots of examples and storys from different people. It will change your way of dealing with people. You will become more courteous :)"
1947,Day New,A good book to read if you want the easy life
1948,Sean Everett,"Absolute best book about human behavior that has for nearly a century, and will continue, to stand the test of time. Many things in life change. But humans never will. At our core all we really want is just to feel loved. If you only read one book in your life make it this one. The art of selflessness has nearly been lost to the sea of selfies but Carnegie makes the truth shine through like a distant lighthouse beckoning each of us to come ""home""."
1949,Muslim2proud,ده من نوع الكتب اللي تبقى عايز تقراها اكتر من مرة بعد ما تخلصها .. مفيد جدا و اسلوب الكاتب مختصر و مقنع، اعتقد ان طريقة كتابته من افضل ما قرأت في مجال التنمية البشرية. كما اجد تجارب الكاتب في الحياة بتربط بين الكلام النظري اللي بيقوله و بين فايدة تطبيقه عمليا.
1950,Mike,Lots of good advice on how to treat others.
1951,Mariella,... another book that should be required in school.
1952,Liu Zhen,"Title: How to Win Friends & Influence PeopleAuthor: Dale CarnegiePages: 288Publisher: Published August 24th 2010 by Pocket (first published 1936) 	This book is officially my favourite book of the year. This book is incredible, it teaches a student the most crucial skills to deal with people. This book revolves around a few theme: everyone likes to always talk in his or her own best interest and everyone who is alive needs to feel a sense of importance. If there is any of a book that I would like to have my brainwashed, How to Win Friends & Influence People will be it.	The structure of the book divides into a few parts. Within each part, it contains a few chapters. Inside each chapter, it summarizes principal(s) at the of each chapter. And of each principal, it is accommodated with specific stories that proves the true value of the principal(s). The principals are recommended to be practiced by the author in our real world - to deal with people. I read this book during Spring Break. I was very surprised that a scholarship that I applied to also require me to read this book. I felt fortunate that I read this book because with the knowledge I gain from this book, I applied to the real world to compete for the scholarship - and I got it at the end. Thanks to this book.	With no further explanatory, I highly recommend this book to high school students and adults. How to Win Friends & Influence People is not only teaching you how to win friends nor to influence people, it is the basic education of morals (I believe it is). This book helps people to survive in the real world - in particular people who work in the business field. "
1953,Wissam Raji,"The kind of book that you say of course for everything you read but when it cools down to practice, it is definitely an eye opener."
1954,Gabriel Romero,good read and alot of eye opening ideas
1955,Abi Olvera,Much better than I expect. Provided many examples where these strategies worked that were quite interesting. I definitely have tried to apply more of these concepts to my day to day interactions.
1956,Mary Elliott,"When I first started reading this book I thought it was bullshit. Not complete and utter bullshit, but overall bullshitty. Of course, it put forward ideas that were kind of nice but they stroke me as nearly impossible to apply in the real world, and the examples provided seemed contrived. It was very hard to believe that people would fall for these kinds of - what I perceived to be - manipulative approaches. And, if these did somehow work, I wasn't sure I wanted to adopt this mentality anyway.As I read on, the book didn't change. The ideas and examples in it didn't change. Somehow, though, my feelings towards it changed. Somehow, I started to understand.I've often been accused of being way too nice to people, too tolerant, too polite, even, on occasion, of being a pushover or a doormat. I've been advised to be harsher and care less about what other people think/feel/want. Of course, we shouldn't let other people govern our lives, our behaviour and our decisions and, on that point, I always agreed with my critics. I even tried to be colder and meaner and, to some degree, I've succeeded; that's not terribly hard to achieve. After all, it's not like I had a plethora of good opinions about everyone - I'm just as judgemental, critical and selfish as the next person. And it's from this aspect that I drew my initial dislike of the book, because I thought it was trying to teach me precisely what I wanted to avoid: to care yet more about others than I do about me.Still, I could never fully agree with the general opinion that I - that we - should be completely selfish, self-sufficient and indifferent to the people around us. I could never share the same appreciation for ""directness"" that other people did, either. It especially peeved me when I heard things such as ""I call 'em like I see' em"" or ""I'm just being honest and if you can't handle it then that's your problem, not mine"". I dislike flattery and falseness as much as anyone, but I always did respect tact and diplomacy and was always of the opinion that extreme directness and an unfiltered speech are decidedly a failing and a disability, rather than a quality. A 5 year-old child can just as easily ""call 'em like he sees 'em"". Sincerity isn't the same as bluntness. Virtually anyone can crush somebody else's self-esteem or ruin a relationship. It takes a hell of a lot more to get people to listen to you.And, not in the least, I do care about people. I mean, okay, not all people, not all the time. People are strange and curious creatures and the ones I meet and interact with are often challenging to my patience and my good will. But a pleasant interaction with a person - especially a person I'd be naturally inclined to dislike - is so much more rewarding than having an argument or a power struggle, more rewarding than even winning one of the latter!We all care about people, even those of us who claim to be indifferent, independent and perpetually unfazed. And we should care. The secret is to do it intelligently.This is where Carnegie's book excelled. It explained to me where I was horribly wrong and reinforced the beliefs that were surprisingly right. It taught me the way to not simply filter out the ""evil"" in my speech and phrase my insults in nicer words, but to really respect and appreciate people, truthfully, without being dishonest and manipulative and, more importantly, without sacrificing my identity in the process.We're all driven by more or less the same emotions, we all feel the same longings, we're all motivated by roughly the same phenomena and we feel the same pain, sadness and resentment when our desires are not met. Self-esteem, the need for a feeling of importance, a love of praise and an ingrained fear of criticism and rejection - these are all human traits, they're all natural and we all share these in common. Recognising these things in other people and fully taking them into account in your interactions is an amazing way to reach the same wavelength with others. It helps to understand them, appreciate them, find a common ground between their feelings and your feelings, between what they want and, ultimately, what YOU want - and do all of this earnestly, gladly, full-heartedly.I'm not saying I'll suddenly become the perfect human specimen now that I've read this book. I know I won't apply quite all of the principles in it and I most likely won't even remember all of them. I'm certain that, even if I carried the book around like a gospel and practised all of its teachings to the letter, there'd be a million cases where they would fail horribly. People are largely unpredictable and this book is far from a fix-all.But it did promise to change my life - if I were to let it - and it did, to a certain extent. It strengthened in me the belief that the people around me are important, that respecting them is important and that being an overall patient, kind, sincere and tactful person can accomplish great things in the long run. It gets five stars from me, not necessarily for its specific teachings (although they're pretty useful, too) but mainly for its very significant message."
1957,LJDestrooper,This is one of the finest books on social behavior ever written
1958,Kamal Yagubov,"Can't say anything bad about this classic. In today's day and age, everything Carnegie wrote about could be found across a variety of self-help articles online, but I would still suggest giving this book a read as the example-focused writing makes it easy to absorb.Favorite excerpt: ""There is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument - and that is to avoid it"""
1959,Prince Ahmed,"Its an amazing book , which tells you the way people thinks about you and how to deal with this to win them to your side !"
1960,Jessica Elizabeth,"An incredible book! I have learnt so much on how to be both intuitive and receptive to the needs of others, including how to communicate better.. and to also be a better listener!.. "
1961,Hosanna,"This is excellent! It challenges both your value of the people around you as well as how you convey that to them, and provides helpful ways and insight to improve in your relationships with anyone you encounter! "
1962,Andrew Flynn,"An amazing manual, one I will re-read for a very long time."
1963,Justin Tapp,"How to Win Friends & Influence People is still one of the Top 40 Amazon Bestsellers for a reason. Dale Carnegie wrote this book in 1936 because no one was aware of anything like it in existence. All recent works I've read on the Great Depression marveled at its importance. Carnegie taught public speaking and became such a popular lecturer that eventually he turned his lectures into this book and updated it throughout his life with real-life illustrations that his students sent to him.(The edition I read was revised in 1981 and has been updated by the editors with some 1970s examples, making the book slightly odd). More than 8 million people in 80 countries have taken his training course.""Dale Carnegie would tell you that he made a living all these years, not by teaching public speaking-- that was incidental. His main job was to help people conquer their fears and develop courage.""Carnegie was scholarly beast in studying people, having read hundreds of biographies and critiqued something like 150,000 speeches.What Carnegie writes jives with recent articles on what Google is looking for in an employee-- how to be someone who leads with confidence. The importance of humility and personal ownership of your own mistakes, while emphasizing others' achievements. Expertise is the least-important to Google and to Carnegie:""15 percent of one's financial success is due to one's technical knowledge and about 85 percent is due to skill in human engineering-- to personality and the ability to lead people."" (p. 22-23)This is a book that probably been little improved on by other self-help books of the same genre, only the details remain-- for which you can find in psychology books. Carnegie gets his point across with probably a couple hundred stories, ranging from tales of Presidents (Lincoln, Taft, Hoover, TR, FDR) and titans of industry (Andrew Carnegie, Rockefeller, Schwab) to various lecture attendees who wrote Carnegie over the years (the index is impressive). Some of these stories--particularly those of Lincoln-- make the point stick in my mind quite vividly. The American history in the book is great. There are also oft-overlooked biblical references, much of what Carnegie is saying is strongly encouraged in the New Testament.You can read an outline of the chapters on wikipedia.I have read many works on pop psychology, and even though I'm aware of my own cognitive biases I still am quite susceptible. A smile from a person makes me like them more-- makes me assume other positive attributes about the person.""'People who smile, tend to manage, teach and sell more effectively, and to raise happier children. That's why encouragement is a much more effective teaching device than punishment'"" (quoting a psychologist, pg. 204).I am often around politicians in hallways and have noticed that they tend to greet strangers with a warm smile, hold the door open for people far behind them, and perform other people-pleasing gestures. It's central to their core. Carnegie gives several examples of politicians and industry leaders in this book who do exactly the same thing-- it's central to their personalities and helps explain their success. People like them just because they seem warm and friendly. I need to smile more. I need to remember more names and call people by their names. All the time.This week I had a rather critical email written to someone, with a complete rational argument. I felt it was my duty, conviction to correct the person's error. I then shelved it. I am going to re-write tactfully Carnegie style. I may still never send it.One of the more powerful points Carnegie makes is that ""You can't win an argument."" (One of his principles is to ""never criticize,"" but he later has a chapter entitled ""How to Criticize--and Not Be Hated for It."")""Why prove to a man he is wrong? Why not let him save his face? He didn't ask for your opinion. He didn't want it. Why argue with him?... What price will I have to pay if I win?"" (p. 312, 326)It demeans people when you set out to prove them wrong, it says ""I'm smarter than you and here's why.""""It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us, but our self-esteem which is threatened"" (338) when someone challenges us. ""Two thousand years ago, Jesus said: 'Agree with thine adversary quickly'"" (356).""(A)s Charles Schwab put it, 'hearty in their approbation and lavish in their praise.' All of us want that. So let's obey the Golden Rule and give unto others (lavish praise) what we would have others give unto us. How? When? Where? All the time, everywhere.""Owning up to one's owns faults is important, especially before entering into a critique of another or in an argument.""When we are right, let's try winning people gently and tactfully to our way of thinking, and when we are wrong--and that will be surprisingly often...let's admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm"" (376). ""Almost all people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance..."" (290).So, encourage others to talk about themselves, talk in terms of their interests, and make them feel important.Criticism in the absence of an understanding of total love and/or respect is going to be harmful. I can scold my son or criticize my wife for something only if they know that they are 100% secure in my unconditional love. I should draw attention to their mistakes ""indirectly,"" and ask questions rather than giving orders-- for which Carnegie gives several examples. An important point in all cultures I've lived in is to ""let the other person save face"" (556).Carnegie has reinforced much of my belief in positive reinforcement of my son-- a cornerstone of ABA therapy for autism. There's principle of ""Make the fault seem easy to correct""(590) and this is crucial in dealing with my son-- the example in the book is one of a mentally challenged child who overcomes by gradually building his strength and confidence in certain tasks.He ends the book on ways to encourage people toward success-- namely focus on the process and small improvements. ""Give a dog a good name"" (579). Put the seed in the other person's mind that they are greater than what they realize-- the results will follow as they become that person.Fantastic, classic book. I give it 5 stars."
1964,Amr Zidan,من امتع الكتب اللي قريتها في حياتي لان الكتاب شيق ومفيد 
1965,Sashi,A beautiful book with loads of wisdom
1966,Kristi Stilwell downing,"When you learn to stop talking all about yourself and start listening to others, your relationships evolve and become more meaningful. It's completely changed how I interact with people especially when I meet someone new. It's not manipulation; it's showing genuine interest in the other person."
1967,Joebiz,Great tips on social skills
1968,Shelley,"One the best books ever written. Why did it take me so long to read this? It will influence my people skills for the better, forever."
1969,Pedro,"Great insight into communication and relationship building. Altough I'd recommend just reading a summary of the main points exposed in the book, as the book mainly consists of (good) examples of putting into practice the conducts the author recommends."
1970,Roselle,"Some of the principles, I already know. I must put this to good use right away."
1971,Sarah Kortright,"First published in 1937, this book is entertaining as well as thought-provoking. The 'influence people' part of the title threw me off; I thought the content would be tips on 'manipulating' people to get what you want, which is why I've put off reading it for so long. Carnegie actually addresses authenticity, consideration for others, and many effective communication techniques. A delightful, helpful book. "
1972,Houssam El okda,This is a book that could change your life!
1973,Jeff Kent,An annual read.... I always pick something useful....
1974,Natalie Rice,"WOW! There is not possibly enough that I could say about this book, so I will keep it brief. Carnegie is one of the smoothest and most entertaining writers I have ever read. And he did his homework. He literally read hundreds of books to collect all of the impelling stories and evidence he presents in his book. This is one book I am determined to read once a year for the rest of my life. "
1975,Yahia Hassan,"I think that this book is one of the greatest books ever, I loved reading because of this book."
1976,Ellin Whitson,This is the best self help book I've ever read. Using the tools in this book helped me immensly in my career.
1977,Magda,"Even though some of the language and concepts are a bit out of date, the essence of this book still holds true. I learned a lot that I've tried to implement in my roles at work and home. I also plan to reread this book periodically to keep the ideas fresh. "
1978,Todd Decker,"I call this the path to awesomeness! Seriously, this is one of the most important lessons there is, how to win friends and influence people. This is such a hard lesson to learn but it is so basic, one of those kindergarten lessons. I just couldn't put this one down because it's so enlightening. I could just see being the kind of person who lights up the room and makes everyone feel better about themselves and is a general positive force in the universe. Now that is awesomeness."
1979,Karen Thibodeau,I've read this book many times... starting 20+ years ago. I think everyone should read this book every few years! It's required reading in my house!
1980,Dio Aufa Handoyo,"A timeless piece even in this time and age. Principles introduced should be read and re-read from time to time, especially the key tenet: sincerely care about the lives of other people."
1981,Eng Amr Hussein,كتاب جيد فى كيفية معاملة الناس بصفة عامة وليس الأصدقاء خاصة .ربط النصائح بالأمثلة مفيد فى تطبيقها ع المستوى الإنسانى او الواقعى .انصح بقراءاته 
1982,PU PU,good
1983,Vickysmatt,"Llegue a este libro buscando algún material que hablara sobre la comunicación no verbal y cuando leí el titulo reconozco que mi primer juicio fue el de es un típico libro de auto-ayuda, pero sin embargo comencé a leerlo por intriga. Esta obrita creo que es elemental para todas aquellas personas que quieran mejorar las interacciones con otras personas. Sus reglas principales son las mismas que aplican muchas religiones o filosofías de vida como el budismo, a diferencia de que están explicadas cosa que creo que a mas de uno nos hacia falta: que nos expliquen porque tenemos que hacer algo por otra persona.La idea del libro que es lo que apliques a tu vida diaria sino seria como leer un prospecto de un medicamento y pensar que me voy a curar sin tomarlo. Note grandes cambios, comencé a sentirme mejor y solo haciendo pequeños ajustes. Es fantástico como un libro o una aclaración a ciertos temas pueden cambiar tu forma de ver, de pensar, de tratar al otro siempre y cuando se apliquen en tu vida, no?Desde ya lo recomiendo totalmente. "
1984,Jasmyn,"Fantastic book, that I've also heard several general authorities recommend. It's pretty much just a reminder to be kind and smile and be interested in other people and their lives, but it's a great reminder. The author tells some fascinating stories and it makes me want to be a better person every time I read this book."
1985,Amy,A great book and perfect reference.
1986,Antonette Morabe,One of the best self-help book i've read! :)
1987,Taylor Mcclellan,This is a classic for a reason. It is filled with little quotes and anecdotes from some of histories greatest people. I will be returning to this again and again for talks and leadership training material. 
1988,Victor Espinoza,Outstanding bookOutstanding bookIt is the best book I have read. It entertaining and full of realistic everyday examples I can put in practice in and out of work. 
1989,Jameel Hijazeen,The best self-improvement book that I have ever read so far!!!
1990,LeeAnn Taylor,"I found this book to be an entertaining and smart read, definitely applicable to modern readers despite its age. The author was insightful, experienced, and has a no-nonsense approach to social and professional success."
1991,Rachelle,I absolutely loved this book. I think everyone should read it. Such wonderful information and so easy to use. It's really about being the best person you can be. I definitely will be reading it again and again.
1992,Anthony A,"This book is an absolutely outstanding book if you care about how you interact with other people - whether it be at work, at church, or at home with family members. A lot of what was in this book was already an integral part of how I interact with people, but I learned a handful of very good lessons. I highly encourage anyone who interacts with people in any capacity to read this book. This is an excellent book. It took me a long time to read because I adhered to the way in which Carnegie expects the reader to cover the book. For example, the reading of each chapter twice."
1993,Kate Wu,I recommend this to anyone that wants to enrich their personal and work interactions. One of the best self-help books I've read! 
1994,Barsoum,this is like a bible for human relations. it should be read again and again. it's an awesome reference and a life changing companion as well.
1995,Adi Nugroho,I read this book in Indonesian edition. I really like this book and give a real influence in my life. This book opened my eyes on how to make friends and influence others.
1996,Chelsea,"A great book, classic and stands over time because the principles are so straight forward, sensible and applicable. They are things that make sense and that we should be doing daily with those we interact. Ive tried a few techniques and it's amazing the results and difference in the human response - especially with how ingrained in technology we are - it's surprising for someone be thanked, given a smile or praise, etc. Recommended read to anyone working with people ... Which is all of us ;) "
1997,Dee,"What a pretty impressive book! Hopefully, I shall apply the principles, although it's kind of difficult to switch to a method you already know to another but I guess this is human nature, always adjusting and evolving!I would definitely recommend it!"
1998,Matt Hulse,"This along with ""How to stop worrying and start living"" should be required reading for every high school senior. We need more people that understand and apply these principles in our society."
1999,Cara,"This book has given me insight into how to win people over, like the title suggests. It caused me to rethink things I thought I knew. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family. This is definitely a book a new college graduate should read. "
2000,Mustafa,هو حقاً كتاب رائع يلهمك لقرائته مجرد اسمه يكفي لالهامك وهو مفيد جداً لتحسين التعامل مع الناس وتكوين علاقات مميزة وجديدة وان شاء الله يفيدكم
2001,Diana,"Although the title is quite cheesy and makes people wonder what is wrong with you, this book is totally an eye-opener! A lot of the ideas in this book made totally sense to me. I actually went along and incorporated some of them as soon as I was finished with a chapter into my daily life and was not disappointed by the results. Although the title suggests a really obnoxious salesmen/businessmen attitude, the content is more focused on real, honest relationships between people. So, if you ever wondered, why some people seem to naturally be popular with everyone and why there are such people we call 'social butterflies', this book shows you exactly what behaviors are responsible for this and how you can easily make them your own, too (and even if you don't, you learn some useful stuff about how to circumvent stressful interactions and fights with other people and how to be a nicer, more approachable person in general)."
2002,Diane,"A must read for how to get better at building relationships. I have the hard copy edition for easy reference. Even, my Michael has read it twice."
2003,Ryan_Napolillo,"This is truly a superb book. It would be enough to leave it at that. The brilliant Dale Carnegie did an outstanding job in writing this book. How to Win Friends & Influence People is a book that makes you think about sociology, how you perceive other people, but most importantly, how other people perceive you. How to Win Friends & Influence People is an excellent publication that if read by all, would make our society exponentially better.It is outstanding that Carnegie has managed to wedge so much knowledge and insight into a mere 262 pages. Every word Carnegie placed throughout the entirety of this text seems to have a particular purpose. Every dozen pages, or so, I felt the urge to stop reading and reflect upon Carnegie’s teachings. I feel that this is the pinnacle of self-help books. As a matter of fact, this feels less like a self-help book, and more of a lucubration of Carnegie’s philosophy.I feel that reading this book has had a tremendous impact on my life. It has changed how I interact with others, and has made me notice how others interact with me. I feel that this is a great book to be read by anyone. I might even call this book life changing. This gives me the sense that I can read other’s minds. I can tell why other people do what they do, and what I can do to make them do what I want to do. If everyone were to treat this book as a bible, the world would be a great place.In conclusion, How to Win Friends & Influence People is an exceptional book that you should read. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I feel that no matter who you are, you will enjoy it, too. It is more than just something to pass the time, it will have a lasting impact on your life."
2004,Kristine,A great book that everybody should read!
2005,Jessi,"This book is filled with an enormous amount of wisdom for dealing with other people. Most of it is simply relational common sense, but presented like this, it serves as a good reminder for even the most ""people smart"" person. It is a must-read for everyone, but especially leaders and those in the workplace. Why make everything so hard when you can easily and kindly find solutions that suit everyone?"
2006,Jenni,This book helps me when i was teen time.. It's really right poin and good practice suggested.. I recomment this book.. Enjoy it..
2007,Erika,"A classic. I love that Carnegie tells a story about a man from Rocky Mount, NC who attended one of his classes- this book was published in 1936! It's timeless."
2008,Virgilyo Souza,Very good book to anyone who are looking for improving their communication skills. I highly recommend this book.
2009,Adam Gossman,"Wow. You might feel silly reading a book called ""How to win friends..."" but wow. wow."
2010,Charles Mccown,"Wonderful book. I didn't know what I had been missing. Full of wisdom and yet the title doesn't do it justice. It's simply a guide on how we may better love and encourage the people around us. The title came across as manipulative so I avoided it for many years. Having finally been convinced to read it, I regret missing out on this great read for so long and wish I'd granted Mr. Carnegie some grace long ago. I could not recommend this book higher."
2011,Jay Thompson,The book has basic stuff that is worth reading ever so often. 
2012,Mohamed Harb,كتاب ممتاز جداً عن التعامل مع الناس وفهم متطلباتهم بالأضافه لأسلوب القصة الرائع
2013,Dr Dinesh,Bang on the mark!
2014,Kristen ,"This was a re-read for me, and I enjoyed it just as much as I had several years ago. I think that this should be required reading for everybody in the whole world. The only reason you shouldn't read this book is if you already have. You might think its not for you - I don't like non fiction or self help books, I prefer fiction and fairytales. But this book? You can't not learn something from it. Promise"
2015,Kelly Ann,"I've read this book twice and will definitely go through it a third time once I graduate and begin embarking my career as an educator. Carnegie's lessons have stood the test of time. Some of the references are a bit dated but when you begin to input these rules into your daily life you immediately see a change in how people respond and treat you. I was recommended this book by a psychology professor that I greatly admired and though I wasn’t much of a reader at the time, I couldn’t put this down. In a world where most of us communicate via electronics today, I believe a book like this is even more necessary because those “common sense” lessons of how to deal with people are even less common nowadays. I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially anyone beginning a new career and entering or leaving the college world. I will recommend this book to all my future students. "
2016,Maddy,This is my absolute favorite book of all time. Totally applicable to almost any situation.
2017,Gibran Tocao,"Some of you might not now this or some of you do already know. If you don't then read it, if you do and you forget then read it again."
2018,Marie,"I love this book. Not only is the advice in it superb but the audiobook read by Andrew MacMillan is a joy lot listen to. Using Carnegie's techniques, I can already see an improvement in my success in relations with others and get what I want more often with little added effort. Basically, Carnegie says what we should all strive toward: being extra extra kind no matter who we're dealing with. A classic I highly recommend!"
2019,Natanael Leon,"Easy to understand, aplicable, and interesting"
2020,Larissa,Must read!
2021,Maria,I think everyone has or should read this book
2022,Francis  Grajales,"«El principio más profundo en el carácter humano es el anhelo de ser apreciado». Como ya lo he señalado, ese impulso es lo que nos diferencia de los animales. Es el impulso que ha dado origen a la civilización misma.”"
2023,Susan Howson,"The last 50 pages or so are just comic relief, but the first parts of this book are pure gold. I try to read it every couple of years, just so I can keep batting my eyes at you all while I steal your wallet. Jk jk!"
2024,Brian Black,"WHen my wife recommended this book to me, I thought, ""I'm not desperate for friends."" but there are great tips on how to be more personable. I highly recommend it."
2025,Mary Ann Spier,"Carnegie is a genius and understands communication and basic human decency in ways that are lost on many. I wish everyone could read this book, but would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their communication,selling or arguing skills. 2 things I always remember from this book-'The sun can make you take off your coat more quickly than the wind''The only way to win an argument is to avoid one'"
2026,April,"Don't judge a book by its title! Horrible title. Great book! It's a ""must read"". "
2027,Mark Daniels,"One of the best books I ever read. This book was written decades ago, and it still rings true today. I believe that this book will still be guiding influencers decades from now."
2028,Kate Powers,"If I had any say in the educational system, I would enforce that every single high school and/or college student read this. Everything Carnegie preached back in the 1930s is still so unbelievably relevant today. Such a groundbreaking and thought provoking novel that really changes the way you do business and how you should treat other human beings. Human decency, composure, and compassion is so important in everyday life. Carnegie did an amazing job of breaking it all down and simplifying how one should think and do business. 5 stars doesn't seem enough. "
2029,Kiran Parab,nice book
2030,cliff,Very profound and inspirational.Very profound and inspirational.This book has opened my eye in so many ways on how to deal with my business and personal life.
2031,Dan Derry,"Brilliant book, offering meaningful advice on personal interaction."
2032,Benn Marine,"Very powerful book, a lot of common sense things in here spelled right out. A book everyone should read at least once and revisit every few years."
2033,Martin Matous,"""how a lot of people is going to try to screw you"" would be a correct title for this book. while reading i recollected many instances when somebody tried to sell me something or make me do something using techniques from this book. definitely worth reading. Dale Carnegie is world renown, his perhaps most famous pupil was Charles Manson, who used it very effectively, as its mentioned in books about Manson."
2034,Daniel Clausen,"So here I am on Chapter 3...and I'm thinking that this has to be one of the most phenomenal self-help books ever written. Basically, it argues that if you earnestly invest in other people, care about them in ways that few people do, you will have success throughout your life. As many others have already commented, the name of the book leads you to believe that it will be a load of sleaze. And indeed, the book's title did put me off it for quite a while. After all, this is a book about how to influence people. For the most part, I haven't found the part of the book where the sleaze comes out. One thing I am wondering about however is how the book will address dealing with horrible people: with the tyrants, emotion terrorists, or just plain whiners. More importantly--the first rule: not criticizing anyone. That seems like it would take quite a toll after a while. "
2035,Thomas Sandu,"I just finished reading this book and I must say that this is the first book that I know I can recommend to everyone I know. And I will do this. A big part of this book is full of examples from sales, but the principles from this book can be applied to every domain, every situation where you interact with other people. So many things inside this book seem common sense in our days, but you will be surprised while you read this book, how often you interact with people against your common sense and against the principles taught in this book.The book is structured in four main chapters:- Fundamental techniques in handling people- Six ways to make people like you- How to win people to your way of thinking- Be a leader: How to change people without giving offense or arousing resentmentThe chapters are packed with real life examples and the reading is fun, you really do understand why the people in the examples had problems and why, after changing their way of interaction with other people, the problems almost disappeared.This book is an inspiration and the more people will follow it, the better or world and work environment will become. A must read!"
