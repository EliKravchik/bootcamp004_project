"11",10,"Henri","Oh my WORD.... What a piece of crap. Boring and senseless. Cant imagine why so many people like this one. "
"20",19,"Sandy","Didn't really need to read this, since I've already read On the Road. Same book, really, although the insanity of the stoned characters is more delightfully creative here. How they interact with others to achieve their insane purposes is a little hard to believe, but it's fun. The lifestyle of the dedicated druggie, on the other hand, is no fun at all."
"30",29,"Pamela D.","This could be the worst book I have ever read. Juvenile, pointless & disgusting."
"32",31,"Nancy McKinley","I hate to quit a book especially 91 pages in but life is too damned short to muddle through this pointless and overrated babble. Wading through inane muck for a few mediocre gems is not worth it."
"57",56,"Tessa","I thought this was OK but really boring so I didn't finish it. I think the book is 100% better than the movie though, because really, who wants to spend 2hrs of their life watching Johhny Depp taking heaps of drugs?"
"62",61,"Faye Ducker","I did not enjoy this book. Although it is seen as a classic, I was bored throughout. There is no real storyline and the constant drug bender was a little gratuitous. Maybe the film will be better."
"71",70,"Alex MacMillan","""One of the most striking characteristics of drug takers is their intense and tedious self-absorption; and their journeys into inner space are generally forays into inner vacuums. Drug taking is a lazy man’s way of pursuing happiness and wisdom, and the shortcut turns out to be the deadest of dead ends. We lose remarkably little by not being permitted to take drugs."" - Theodore Dalrymple""The only thing white people talk about when they get high... is other times that they got high. I could listen to that all night."" - Dave ChappelleIt's only been a few months since I finished a sublease (I unwittingly signed) in which I shared an apartment with a drug addict and his codependent girlfriend. This book was a like a bad acid trip back into the vibe of living with a selfish loser: being an adult besieged daily by the pathetic existence of a corpulent, narcissistic manchild and his rotating coterie of customers.Hunter S. Thompson is an awful, selfish, completely unsympathetic character. So is his attorney in crime, Oscar Acosta. You can see why both ""protagonists"" ultimately died alone, broken men. They demonstrate themselves to be complete monsters in this book, inflicting manipulation and abuse onto anyone they cross paths with. Their antics, as with their idiotic ideological rationalizations for their actions, must be titillating to the kind of juvenile who smokes weed before going to high school english class, giggling to his Hot-Topic clad compradres as though he were Medgar Evers.Was this book edgy when it first came out? Is what happens in this story supposed to be funny?Thompson has a surprising amount of filler here, given that it's a 200 page book where his drug abuse gives him the freedom to make up whatever stories he wants and pass it off as hallucinations. At multiple points he fills pages by repeating, word-for-word, the headlines of newspapers, or describing his paranoia about getting caught and repetitively catastrophizing the consequences. (Nothing ever happens, Thompson never faces up to the consequences of his actions)"

"123",122,"Sara Pauff","I read about 100 pages of this book, then skimmed ahead and decided I wasn't interested in finishing it. All he does is take a ton of drugs and drive around the desert. This may have been shocking and interesting years ago when the book was published, but now it's just another weekend. What's the point? What's he trying to say? Is there a meaningful plot buried amongst all these hallucinations of giant reptiles and white rabbits? If there was, I couldn't find it. Maybe it's a book best read stoned."
"132",131,"Jay Kenworthy","This is the first book of the New Journalism ilk that I've read since I struggled through ""The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test"" in college. I never found it to my liking, but a friend's insistence that this is the funniest book he's ever read piqued my curiosity. I was disappointed, to say the least. I'm sure Fear and Loathing was very important for its time, and Gonzo Journalism was a groundbreaking new genre. But the lack of plot doomed this book from the start. And despite a few funny scenes, the book does not retain its importance today. Worst book I've read in a long time."
"154",153,"Karrie","I was awful. I would give it not stars if I could. Vulgar and profane. Awful, awful. Don't read it!"
"172",171,"Robin Randolph","One of the worst books I have ever read. What a waste of time, paper and ink!"
"179",178,"Tracyh","I thought this was among the most sickening books I have ever read. A complete waste of time."
"180",179,"Kyle Ryan","Sooo….I don’t get the appeal. This observation struck me quite early in the book, and much of the rest of my reading of the mercifully short ‘Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas’ was spent trying to figure out what all the fuss was about and why I didn’t have the urge to participate in the fuss. Let’s start with the primary disadvantage I had – over 40 years of time elapsing between 1971 and 2013. Let’s just say this book doesn’t hold up that great. I can’t recall offhand, but I hope that the contemporary novels and essays that I consider my favorites aren’t as littered with the equivalent of Nixon/Agnew jokes as this book was. Additionally, this book is going to resonate with people who consider hard drugs “cool”, are fascinated with the effects of said drugs, and refer to people that are trying to keep hard drugs away from drug users as “uncool” and/or “The Man.” The country’s perspective on the drug culture has changed so much in the ensuing time that much of Thompson’s sharpest satire falls on deaf ears.  In today’s world, drunk and high driving is universally looked down upon by society. From a drug perspective, outside of marijuana, which recent legalization trends would suggest is now deemed ‘a good time in moderation and pretty harmless in the grand scheme of things’, most other drugs would be categorized as ‘try it out if that’s your thing, but watch out because your life can really go into a toilet spiral in a hurry if you start abusing it.’ Given such societal context, I have trouble commiserating with the two guys blasted out of their minds for a week straight mooching and stealing their way through a Las Vegas joyride. Am I supposed to be idolizing these guys? Am I supposed to side with the guy who vomits in his shoes by mistaking them for a toilet and then attacks an old cleaning lady at the knees because he confuses a mop handle for a battle axe? No matter how square and backwards the law enforcement community is regarding prosecuting criminals, the book’s protagonists don’t exactly scream ‘renegade heroes’ to me.It seems like one of the arguments the book is making is that the American Dream is there for anybody who’s willing to lie, cheat, and steal their way there. And even if you’re high on drugs, if you’re a smooth talker (and ideally a lawyer), there are plenty of idiots out there waiting for you to take advantage of them. It’s a grim worldview and not one I’m eager to inhabit. Plus, the volume of drug use and the depictions of its effects has a ‘look at me! I’m so anti-The Man I do lots of drugs and f*ck stuff up and get away with it!’ vibe to it that turned me off. Or maybe I’m just a square and will grow an unironic moustache and wear aviator shades later in life while telling the kids next door to keep the music down. Given the alternative, maybe that’s not such a bad thing."
"188",187,"Nadine Larter","Oh I don't really know where to begin with my absolute hate for this book. Hunter Thompson is a famous journalist. He is respected. He rode with the Hells Angels and he interviewed all the musicians that we worship. He was Rolling Stone Magazine ""cool"". He was so cool that friggen Johnny Depp played him in TWO movies. Loving him is just a given. Apparently. Unfortunately I can't get past the fact that I just think he's a fucking twat. "
"205",204,"B.C.","Abandoned.This book was awful. There was no plot and no character development. It was just a guy doing drugs. Drugs aren't cool to me, nor are they funny. Watching (reading about) people on drugs makes me feel bad because I watching an empty soul try to fill their black hole with an abundance of futility. The writing was short and choppy. He did not change his style from magazine to novel. He had some good descriptions and the language was very natural. This is because he wrote like he spoke. Drug humor is not my thing and I feel bad having wasted my time. "
"241",240,"Elzakun","I was so not impressed. Should have read this when I was 15."
"258",257,"Echo","A friend insisted I HAD to read this and loaned me his copy. I read it, but I hated every second of it. He tried to explain to me what was so great about it. I still don't get it. I guess I just don't care to read pointless books about a couple of guys getting high. I dislike this book more than anything else I've ever read in my entire life, and that's not an exaggeration."
"269",268,"Ed Bremner","I can see how people might think this was good....maybe the same people who go to a gallery and see a pile of shit in the middle of the floor, with a price tag of millions of dollars.""Oh but how challenging"" they say ""At the very edge of what we call art"" ""Re-establishing the borders of art"" etc etc.No.....its just a pile of crap."
"292",291,"Kathleen Harrington","Expecting great things of Hunter S. Thompson, I was disappointed by this monologue of narcissistic revelry. The whole novel details general fuckery with a heavily egotistical lilt. I'm an ideas person. I prefer ideas to experiences for experience's sake. Thompson spends the book experiencing mescaline, and I was left experiencing nothing but disappointment."
"310",309,"Michael Battye","I've had my share of multiple day booze benders so I GET the appeal of unplugging and not giving a fuck for a few days. The hardest drug I've ever done is grass, so I can't relate to the degree of unplugging in this book. I had to read a few other reviews before sharing my thoughts because I wondered whether I might have read a different version of the book to those who rave about it. I like a bit of self loathing from time to time, but when its completely self-inflicted by a complete lack of regard for everything and everyone around you, it's not quite so worthy of celebration. I appreciate the satirical social commentary of the American culture of excess, but maybe being 40 years old worked against it for me. Some people might find this book liberating, but I found it a pretty shallow and pointless. "
"324",323,"E","I realize you're dead now Mr. Thompson but, Y U WRITE THIS?"
"345",344,"Julie Williamson","I read this book to impress a guy. That's the last time I ever did that."
"373",372,"Marita","Oh man. I don't do enough drugs to enjoy this book. Got about 50 pages in and had to give up."
"393",392,"Tiho Kujo","this book is for people who actually think dan blizerian is king, those who after watching movie wall street thought that they don't live as they should. For those who think that they should try everything and then they dont and then feel unhappy. book for boring ""I have old camera I am pro photographer"" hipsters.in short: no plot, just insane unbelievable amount of drug addled wondering about life. I did 2/3ds of book and no point reading it at all."
"394",393,"Noe Crockett ","This book was crap. 204 pages of some dude staying completely wrecked. There was no point, I kept waiting for some deep meaning to come out of it but it never did. A complete waste of my time."
"399",398,"Stephen Arnott","Hunter S Thompson is a talented writer with an incredible ear for words, but this story is empty. Empty of interest or meaning.Two men go to Las Vegas, get high (why, I don't know; they don't appear to enjoy it) and in a very selfish, arrogant way annoy, inconvenience, insult and occasionally terrorise (I'm referring to the waitress and the elderly hotel maid) the people around them. The point being...what?In Thompson's defence, this work started life as a couple of magazine features. It was never meant to be a book and doesn't work as one."
"400",399,"Sherlindreah","I just hate everything that looks like drugs praising and I don't really see the interest of a book with no stories involving two guys who do nothing but being two totally fucked up freaks.I'll give Thompson another chance though (even if one of his best friends was Johnny Depp who I despise as well.The guy is bonkers and plays bonkers...and of course people cry ""genius !"" at that...)No point in doing anything with this book than forgetting it quickly"
"410",409,"Manray9","Over-praised, drug-fueled trash. I wouldn't call it literature."
"412",411,"Haloperidol","mmmmm Extrañamente , no me ha gustado.Yo creo que me lo he leido en un mal momento y bueno no se.Me ha costado acabar de leerlo y no me ha hecho demasiada gracia que al hacer la pelicula hayan usado parrafos exactamente iguales.Me resultaba raro leer algo que habia oido como una voz en off al principio de una pelicula ( por cierto a mi la peli ni fu ni fa, tiene sus cosas ,pero es de esas pelis en las que Terry Gilliam ME AGOBIA).Me costaba enterarme de lo que leia, aunque tengo que reconocerle el merito de transmitir a la perfeccion sensacion de confusion (! rodolí!)"
"414",413,"Lois","Hated this book."
"431",430,"Jackie","I can't see why this book is so popular. Best bit is the illustrations by Ralph Steadman.Story starts at frantic pitch, stays there throughout, then stops."
"434",433,"WendyMcP","I give up. I know many HST fans, but I just couldn't hang with this one. A few chapters in and then it moved further and further down the stack of books on the night stand. ""Which one tonight? Fear & Loathing? Nahhh."""
"440",439,"Ed Blanco","Stupid."
"451",450,"Cathy DuPont","I will not kid you and say that being twisted on drugs won't help you understand this book more; it will. Not a necessity but once you dig deeper into the mind and works of one Hunter S. Thompson you will crave whiskey, beer and ""...everyone narcotic known to mankind..."" Enough of my story, this is after all a book review.Rest assured that is not my comment and those words were not uttered by me. I copied it from another Goodreads member. I tried reading the book and got to about 1/4 and just shook my head in amazement and wonder. (I had previously glanced through some comments many of which were four and five stars from members of Goodreads.)Then I got the movie with Johnny Depp and watched most of it, then went back to the comments here. Then read more of the book. Guess I've never been ""twisted on drugs"" enough to like and/or understand why mind altering drugs such as LSD and methamphetamines were the rage in the late '60's and '70's. I hope that doesn't make me a bad person because I'm not judging Hunter Thompson and Gonzo anything. It's just not my taste, color and imagination. "
"452",451,"Elinor","A friend of mine summed up my feelings towards this book by describing it as ""shallow, boastful and tedious""."
"476",475,"Viridian5","I gave up on page 95, too disinterested to go on. It started off sharp, but I got tired of all the drug-fueled paranoia and ego, how it kept hitting one note over and over."
"503",502,"Alicia","I saw the movie first and liked it. I read the book and couldn't get the images of the movie out of my imagination, or lack thereof. Movie better!"
"504",503,"Cheri M","He used words well. the story itself was not entertaining to me. "
"515",514,"Missy J","Very difficult to follow. There are some funny sentences here and there, but this steady stream of consciousness plus the fact that fiction and reality are not distinguishable, made it very hard for me to follow the story, thus I didn't enjoy it."
"525",524,"Bianca","When a friend recommended this book to me, it was after we had a conversation about Las Vegas and how I had worked there. Consequently, I figured the book was about Las Vegas, the mafia, the darker side of Vegas, gambling, working the system, etc. Normal sort of Las Vegas book themes. I should've read the reviews or something beforehand. This one is all about 2 guys' drug binge for a week while they happened to be in Las Vegas in the 70s. Talk about some gnarly stuff. I've never even HEARD of half the drugs they mention, and has less knowledge about what kind of crazy trips they induce. At any rate, there are a couple of comical moments in the book, but overall, not worth reading (and since the books are 99.99% of the time better than the movies, I probably wouldn't watch the film either)."
"572",571,"Brenda Jean","I tried. More than once. I just couldn't do it."
"581",580,"kaitlin","I think I missed something. This is supposed to be an American classic, but I just didn't get it. It took me about a month to read 1/3 of it and then I just quit. "
"584",583,"Lauren Gural","No. "
"588",587,"Wood","This book is awful. Tho movie as well."
"604",603,"Kaitlin Mooney","What a crap book. I might of enjoyed it more if II knew more about the politics of the 70s I was only able to grasp one Lyndon Johnson reference and that was only because me and my dad were watching his inaugural speech on the american history channel before I read that chapter. Like I would know what LBJ meant. I hate the drug the culture. I am getting rid of this book so if anyone wants it tell me, its yours. "
"608",607,"Ali Ünal","What a waste of time."
"618",617,"Jafar","Yes, I see all the raving reviews and the four- and five-star ratings, but I honestly don’t remember the last time I was so bored and annoyed by a book. Barring a massive conspiracy, maybe I just didn’t get this book? This is what I got from the book. Please help me if missed something. We drove more than 100 miles an hour while drunk and high. WAHAHAHA! We ran up a huge bill and fled the hotel without paying it. WAHAHAHA! We picked up a teenage girl and gave her drugs and then left her alone, all scared and paranoid. WAHAHAHA! We nearly strangled the poor cleaning lady. WAHAHAHA! Do the good people who’ve never done, and will never do, and in reality will be quite appalled by the things described in this book, really find these tales so interesting and charming? Or did this book offer subliminal messages about human nature or sociopolitical conditions of its time that I missed? What does this have to do with the heart of the American dream? Describing the book as some kind of a backlash against the Vietnam War and the fraudulent Nixon administration must be another joke that I don’t get. This book somehow reminded me of Sexual Life of Catherine M. People waving their filthy laundry – the stench going up to high heavens – in our face, just out of sheer narcissism. Look at me! Aren’t I great?This book must have been really cool and hip when it was published in 1971. If anyone writes a book like this these days, the only thing that I have to say is: grow the fuck up. "
"621",620,"Tafena","Easily the worst book I have read. I hope the movie is better"
"629",628,"Alethea","Not my thing at all. Dribbling drug drivel. For me it's like a loooooong dream sequence without any literary merit. "
"646",645,"Ruby","Nope, couldn't do it. There was nothing gripping me to the story or compelling me to go on. Even the ""funny"" bits were trying too hard. I thought this book would be a fun Christmas read but it was just... No. Possibly I have just heard enough of this sort of story for one lifetime. Other people's hallucinatory experiences = BORING to me! Even the writing was bad. Ugh! Ok, I will stop now. "
"657",656,"Rory","Stupid. How did this come to be considered a classic. It's supposed to be funny but I seem to have missed most of the humor."
"666",665,"Robert Jacoby","I didn't like this book much. Oh, there are funny episodes strewn throughout, even some laugh-out-loud moments. But as the ""story"" moves on you'll find that everything is self-induced. It's just Hunter S. Thompson (and his lawyer) sent by a magazine to cover events in Las Vegas over a weekend, but instead they're loading themselves up on whatever drug they can get their hands on: mescaline, acid, cocaine, uppers, downers, ether, amyl, tequila, rum, pot. ""In search of the American Dream.""Right.Just watch the fun now, kids! We’re going to get loaded up on whatever mind-altering substances are available and Let’s…See…What…Happens! Even if that means putting ourselves and innocent folks in life-threatening circumstances! And when we “come down,” don't worry, we’ll just reach for more (or different) drugs and do those! And do it all over again! And again! And because we don’t *really* have anything to say, about anything (throwing a sentence or two in about Nixon to make it look like you're talking about “something” doesn't count), we’ll get in the car (our *rental* car) and drive around and drag race with ""the man""! And vomit out the window! And ruin hotel rooms that we don’t have to pay for! What a dick move.After a couple of episodes I was wondering when the heroin or crystal meth was going to be administered. Oh. Wait. Is *that* stepping over the line?Crap like this wears thin really fast because, in the end, it has to end. It’s the same reason Cheech and Chong aren't doing their ""drug bit"" anymore: it's old and pathetic. Because it's only funny being a dope-head for a little while. A *real* little while. Then you wake up. And that’s when your limited view of the world is revealed; if not to you then certainly to everyone around you: that the drugs are not expanding your universe, they’re actually making the universe collapse in on you—selfish, self-absorbed, pitiable “you.”How childish. How retarded. And by that I mean ""stunted,"" for that's the origination of this text: a stunted and self-centered view of the world."
"698",697,"Sera","I thought that this book was terrible. At times it was funny, but overall, I found no point in it."
"700",699,"Alec","I honestly could barely get through this book. It has no plot, it really is just a bunch of rambling about doing a case full of enough drugs to kill an elephant, and roaming around Las Vegas. There is absolutely no story, and nothing new or exciting to read about it. It's literally just drunken ramblings of 2 men doing every drug imaginable and going to, of all places, Paradise City. I just don't see what is entertaining about it, or why it is considered such a classic. I kept reading about how it has so much to say about American culture and the ""American Dream,"" but once again I found it to be just drunken, incoherent rambling. I don't even normally write reviews on books, I guess I am just pissed that I spent 20 bucks on such garbage. Maybe if I tried watching the movie first or reading it at a later date I would understand why it is so popular and why everyone and their mother has a tattoo of Johnny Depp tripping balls in the desert, but that won't be for a while."
"701",700,"Tanja","Only read 20% of the book but it didn't seem like it was going to improve. I don't quite get all the high ratings."
"704",703,"Jen Nguyen","I read this book based on a recommendation...and I shouldn't have bothered. This is one of the few books that I tried to get through but just couldn't. I can't appreciate the story because I don't do drugs, so I had no idea what he was talking about half the time. The other half of the time, it just bored/confused me. The story never develops into anything meaningful or anything that makes even the slightest bit of sense. I have a feeling the people who claim to like this book are either bandwagon fans or drug addicts. As for me...I am neither. So, not my cup of tea."
"706",705,"Katie Lindquist","Didn't get it, didn't like it."
"734",733,"Patti","Meh. Maybe I'm too old for this book or I should have read it when I was more adventurous. Couldn't get into screaming, drug induced road trip. I prefer a plot or message."
"749",748,"Wendy Crittenden","i am 90% sure i read this, but i don't remember really taking a liking to his writing. maybe i just don't like the cult following he has. your guess is almost as good as mine."
"751",750,"Courtney Perry","After about 50 pages I finally had to give up on this book, which is something I usually never do!! I guess I can see how it could be funny and entertaining, but to me it was really just annoying how the two main characters are narrating through acid-filled heads. You have to really try and search for the plot of the book through the extreme hallucinations that the main characters are constantly seeing. Maybe if I had read further, would have enjoyed it more, but it probably just wasn't for me!"
"754",753,"Jen Jaketic","I agree with another review: don't read this if you have never read Hunter Thompson before. Actually, don't even read this at all. I think two of his other books, ""Hell's Angels"" and ""Fear and Loathing on the 72 Campaign Trail"" are great - documentaries done in his voice. This is just a book about him and his attorney being high off a bunch of drugs...and the movie is way better, as it actually had a point. There was no Super Bowl in the book."
"777",776,"Luke Petersen","this book is silly"
"785",784,"EgoYoMe","So boring."
"799",798,"Mahana Petersen","While technically I was on drugs (cold meds) when reading this, I feel they weren't strong enough to get me through it or make me understand any of it. It's chaotic, wild and nonsensical. Thoroughly disjointed with entertaining moments and WTH did I get myself into ones as well."
"822",821,"Beckie","Frankly, I just don't get it. What does everyone see in this book? It's just the drug-addled ramblings of a rebellious misfit as far as I can tell."
"836",835,"Anna Brammeier","Unfortunately, despite its revered placement in the niche group of stoner-stream-of-consciousness lit, I did not like Fear and Loathing at all. The narrative is even less apparent than in On The Road, and the characters are flat out unlikable as well as being unintelligible. I didn't make it past page thirty. The only good thing I can say about it is that I like the inclusion of illustrations, even if they were ugly. "
"856",855,"GONZA","Libro lisergico dall'inventore del gonzo journalism, morto suicida a 68 anni meno di un mese fa. Parlava di se stesso in terza persona il Dott.Gonzo, reporter di guerra e giornalista sportivo, oltre che scrittore di questo romanzo psichedelico e allucinato in cui racconta di un weekend tossico in nella capitale americana più finta del mondo.Il libro, uscito inizialmente a puntate su Rolling Stone, è stato poi portato al cinema da Terry Gillam e interpretato da un fantastico Benicio del Toro assieme a Johnny Depp, film tra l'altro bruttarello IMHO. Come storia è pazzesca, va presa a piccole dosi, quindi siccome ritengo dobbiate leggerla, ve ne posto una piccola parte:[...] San Francisco e la metà degli anni Sessanta erano un bel tempo e un bel posto da vivere. Forse ha significato qualcosa. O forse no, alla lunga... ma nessuna spiegazione, nessun insieme di parole o musiche o ricordi può toccare la consapevolezza d'essere stato là, vivo, in quell'angolo di tempo e di mondo. Qualunque cosa significasse...La Storia è difficile da conoscere, per via di tutte le stronzate che ci aggiungono, ma anche senza essere sicuri di cosa dice la Storia pare del tutto ragionevole pensare che ogni tanto l'energia di un'intera generazione si concentri in un lungo bellissimo lampo, per ragioni che sul momento nessuno capisce - e che mai spiegheranno, retrospettivamente, ciò che è veramente acceduto. Il mio ricordo principale di quel tempo sembra aggrappato a una o cinque o forse a quaranta notti - o mattine molto presto - quando mezzo sconvolto lasciavo il Fillmore e, invece di andare a casa, prendevo la grandiosa Lightning 650 e sfrecciavo sopra al Bay Bridge a centosessanta all'ora con indosso dei calzoncini L. L. Bean e un giubbotto Butte da pastore... irrompevo di là del tunnel di Treasure Island sullo spettacolo di luci di Oakland, Berkley e Richmond, non molto sicuro su quale uscita imboccare una volta arrivato di là [...]... ma assolutamente certo che per qualunque strada fossi andato sarei arrivato in un posto dove la gente era ispirata e selvaggia, esattamente come me: nessun dubbio su questo...C'era follia in ogni direzione, a ogni ora. Se non attraverso la Baia, allora su al Golden Gate o già sulla 101 per Los Altos o La Honda...Potevi sprizzare scintille dovunque. C'era una fantastica universale impressione che qualunque cosa si facesse fosse giusta, che si stesse vincendo...E quella, credo, era la nostra ragion d'essere - quel senso di inevitabile vittoria contro le forze de Vecchio e del Male. Vittoria non in senso violento o militare: non ne avevamo bisogno. La nostra energia avrebbe semplicemente prevalso. Non c'era lotta - tra la nostra parte e la loro. Avevamo tutto l'abbrivio noi; stavamo cavalcando un'onda altissima e meravigliosa...Ora, meno di cinque anni dopo, potevi andare su una qualsiasi collina a Las Vegas e guardare verso ovest, e con gli occhi adatti potevi quasi vedere il segno dell'alta marea - quel punto in cui l'onda, alla fine, si è spezzata per tornare indietro. [...]""Paura e disgusto a Las Vegas"" , 1971, Hunter S. ThompsonNell'edizione Bompiani c'è un utilie dizionarietto per capire al meglio citazioni e acidi presenti nel testo, le parole in questione, accuratamente ""grassettate"" hanno una specifica scritta da alcuni scrittori italiani, esperti nell'epoca della beat generation, alla fine del libro.

"914",913,"Reddy Katz","what a bloody awful book - but then ive never been into drug related stories - the best part about it was that it's really really SHORT !"
"921",920,"Arielle88","First off, I’m really into drug books. They’re like a window into the drug culture of a different time and place. I started reading Fear and Loathing and loved chapter one. Ether and Amyls? New candidates for my look-up-on-Erowid list. The anecdote with the hitchhiker was entertaining enough. I was excited to see where the story would go.And then it never went anywhere. I mean, is it me? Did I just miss the point? Or was every chapter really just a disconnected story about two main characters being incoherent and destructive? Where was the plot?? I recently read Junky by William Burroughs and in that book the narrator was high and did crazy things every chapter, but there was so much more continuity and plot development and depth than there was in this book. The story had a point. I’m not trying to say that Fear and Loathing has no themes. The parts where he discusses what went wrong in the ‘60s and the acid generation’s wrong turns stand out as clear and interesting in my otherwise boring and painful memories of this book. But that happened like twice. Maybe three times. It seemed like he felt compelled to tack-on some themes to his enthusiastic recounting of crazy drug adventures. Maybe I missed more subtle indicators of meaning. Maybe the wacked-out drug times were more meaningful when the book was published in 1969 and those kinds of descriptions were ground-breaking and controversial. Not sure where the problem lies, but me and this book did not connect.Also, I've gotta say that I lost all sympathy for the main characters they cover up lawyer-dude’s rape of that girl (and yes, giving a woman lots of drugs to the point where she can’t talk or walk and then having sex with her is absolutely rape, even if she weren't underage). I get that they’re amoral, I get it, but that whole section could only be entertaining and excusable if we don’t see rape as being typically lifetime-traumatic and sad. Whatever hedonism or political point or pointlessness the characters were trying to push couldn't be important enough to rape some kid. I mean, I get that realism is important and that if stuff like that happens it should be depicted. But it can be depicted in different ways. The narrator and the “perspective” of the story gave her no sympathy or empathy, in a way that was explicitly linked to her (“ugly, pit bull”) appearance.So yeah, not a fan of this book. But apparently people study it in like academia. I've got to read some academic paper on it, out of pure, morbid curiosity if nothing else."

"978",977,"Wendy Scott","I have a theory about this book, and that is: You probably have to be at least a little into chemical experimentation yourself to like it. 'Fear and Loathing' has been recommended to me by a number of people over the years, some of whom I had (and still have) a lot of respect for. This last year I finally picked the book up, and . . . I guess I should state at this point that I'm not an ""experimental"" kind of person.Fear and Loathing is (apparently) based on real experiences from Hunter Thompson's life. In this book, Thompson and his 'lawyer' travel to Las Vegas on a writing assignment. Thompson is supposed to be covering a big off-road race in the desert, but really the trip is an excuse for him and his friend to hang out in Vegas hotels and get messed up on all kinds of strange illicit substances. I finished this book more out of determination than anything, and quite honestly I felt like I was witnessing something akin to bulimia. How appealing is it to watch people make themselves sick over and over again? I guess the appeal is in seeing just how crazy two people are willing to get (in one scene, Thompson takes a dose of adrenochrome, ostensibly extracted from the adrenal gland of a living human donor). Then again, if this kind of activity doesn't appeal to you . . .The only thing in this whole book that I found initially promising was Thompson (and friend's) decision to gate-crash a regional law enforcement conference while in their (perpetual) chemically-altered state of consciousness. Surely, I thought, something interesting will come of this! Nope. It didn't. The two friends stayed at the conference for a while, had some weird hallucinations, scared some people in the hotel and that was that. There were a couple of other misadventures involving bashed-up cars and a girl Thompson's lawyer picked up on an airplane flight, but the whole time I was reading all this I couldn't shake the feeling that this book was written in a language I didn't understand. When I finally got to the last page I felt somewhat oppressed, and it frustrated me that I didn't know how to explain this feeling to friends who were fans of Thompson's writing. When I put the book down all I wanted to do was take a walk out in the desert and clear my head by looking at the plants and lizards and rocks. But I guess that makes sense. Nature writing is so much more my kind of thing . . . "

"994",993,"Nenia *War of the Adorables* Campbell","Going through the reviews made me feel a little cowed because almost all of them are 4- and 5-star reviews and even the people who really didn't like it caved and gave it a ""3"" just because of its so-called literary merit. WHAT literary merit? I hadn't the faintest idea what was going on — and considering what the author was popping, I'm pretty sure HE didn't, either.From what I could get, this is the basic itinerary of Hunter and his gang.-Smoke, drink, and pop tabs while going over 100MPH in the desert.-Scare the crap out of the poor teenage boy hitchhiker they pick up (to the point where he jumps ship, preferring to take his chances WALKING in MIDDLE OF THE DESERT).-Smoke, drink, and pop tabs.-Buy guns and shit. Those lizards are watching you.-Kidnap young girl, feed her tabs, and RAPE her.-Smoke, drink, and pop tabs.-Go to hotel and act like total assholes.-Tell hotel concierge that aforementioned girl is a “patient” of theirs who's currently on lithium.-Smoke, drink, and pop tabs.-Freak out because you run out of coke — but it's OK, there's a convenience store with a clerk who'll sell you over-the-counters under the table.-Smoke, drink, and pop tabs. Snarf your ill-gotten prescription pills. Who cares what they're for or what they do? They're medicine and they're for your HEART, dammit. Why are my organs coming out of my stomach?-Buy some useless shit because you're an upper-middle-class waste of space and you can. Also, albino dogs rule. I don't know why. White dog. White rabbit. Maybe there's a connection? There isn't? I'm on acid, man. Of course there's a fucking connection. Drug logic. Speaking of which —-Smoke, drink, and pop tabs.-Insult some marines because the war is a fucking waste.-Smoke, drink, and pop tabs.-Laugh crazily at your own brilliance and hillarity. Then shop at the 1960s equivalent of Hot Topic and mope about how nobody understands what it's like to be living as a nonconformist in a conformist world. Console yourself with a Che Guevera T-shirt purchased at the GAP. Then see if you can smoke the fabric preservers.My God, what a loathsome man. I don't understand why people are saying that this book is the representation of the “American dream” or a brilliant criticism of American society. The only impression I was left with was of the ranting memoirs of a drug-addled sociopath who has no qualms about electrocuting his friend with a radio or selling their best friend's $100 dollar gun to pay a $30 dollar loan to that same friend (WTF). Sure, there were some really funny lines in this book, but it's a cringey kind of humor. Like when your best friend gets totally wasted and starts talking about all her sexploits of past years and everyone's laughing but you know they're never going to see her the same way again but she is ignoring all of your pointed signals to STFU while she's ahead and just carries on talking about the cucumbers and the rubber body suit? Just like that. But on acid."

"1038",1037,"Abdullah Alhomoud","What is this shit? Dude gets sent on a couple of writing assignments to Vegas, but instead decides to take the opportunity to fuck around, do a shitload of drugs, and pretend to look for the “American Dream”, which is just an excuse to be a self-entitled prick and a reckless party fiend.Is this supposed to be an ironic jab at the American lifestyle, an infiltration, a “look at me, I’m not one of you, but I can pretend to be” schtick? Because it’s not. Thompson just comes off as some privileged man fucking around because he can afford to, because he can get away with it. Maybe he would’ve found the American Dream if he had looked in the mirror.And his writing leaves a lot to be desired. He dedicates a large chunk of the book rambling on about his paranoid thoughts and what-if situations. I mean, sure, we all like to think about imaginary scenarios, but that hardly makes for reading material for anyone else. This story (if you can call it that) shouldn’t have left the author’s notebook."

In truth, it was simply a recording of an event where two folks consumed lots and lots of drugs and didn't have the least bit of a good time. At times it rose to begin perhaps a social commentary, but then it stumbled and fell in some ether filled hallucinatory stupor.After spending a life time hearing people rave about this bit of counter culture literature, I'm left mostly disappointed."

Not just in the sense that it has a lot of talk about vomit and blood, but also it just follows some icky people. I'm sorry, I cannot bring myself to like either protagonist. I read it with a kind of ""aww, do I have to?"" attitude. I picked it up each time knowing I would be disgusted by what was happening, but I guess that was the point, so kudos on getting that across I suppose."

"1361",1360,"Marlan","This book is no doubt iconic in how it explores drug use and the aftermath of the 60s.That may be, but it does so by being a thoroughly unpleasant book. The story follows two bonkers, drug-addled individuals as they create mayhem in Las Vegas over the course of a week. It is written in first-person, so you get a glimpse into the train of thought of their horrible decision-making, which exacerbates the distastefulness. As the book goes on, their grasp on reality loosens, the story becomes more disjointed, and it becomes difficult to even pay attention. I breathed a sigh of relief when the book finished.In effect, it was like being forced to talk to (and follow around) the crazy druggie who just caused a scene on the street corner before running off. It may have been entertaining for the first two seconds, but it got old really fast.I imagine this book may capture the ""feel"" of an era quite well, hence why so many have related to and loved it. But if so, it must also be demonstrating why that era combusted - chaos, craziness and general ugliness. And it is exactly those attributes that make the book unpleasant to read."

"1379",1378,"Suad Shamma","I admit, I picked up this book with very high expectations. I know it was made into a film (one I've yet to watch), and I know that it is one of those greatly talked about books, but what really pushed me to buy it was the fact that one of my friends spoke highly of it (and I tend to trust her judgments in books). Not this time though.This may not come as a surprise to many, as I've already reviewed On the Road and was one of the very few people who did not give it a five star rating, but at least I ""liked"" it, as opposed to this waste of time. I really wanted to get it, and I really wanted to find it funny, and I really wanted to like it - no, LOVE it - but I couldn't. I finished it, out of pure determination if anything, but I still could not find anything amusing or enlightening about this crazed journey. I suppose I am categorized with the few who failed to see the humor in embarking on a journey with a massive amount of drugs in your trunk as you consume excessive amounts of alcohol simultaneously.I did not expect to relate to his journey, I read it in the hopes that I would feel the way On the Road made me feel, which is to pack my bags and head out for a grand adventure. I read it in the hopes that I would perhaps experience a lifestyle so different from mine, a form of educating yourself so-to-speak. Admittedly, I did read about a completely different lifestyle, but it is not one I wanted to experience, or enjoyed in the least.Maybe this book was a breakthrough in its time, I will give it that much, but I find it very overrated and a huge disappointment. I will say this though, these kinds of books, I find, are usually a lot better translated into films. I do plan on watching the film, and I suspect I may actually find it amusing, but in my opinion a journey such as this one translated into writing fails miserably.Finally, I just want to say that it's laughable how many people take other's reviews personally. It doesn't mean anything to me that I don't get ""it"", whatever ""it"" is. If we all thought the same way, there would be no point in reviewing books at all."
