1,11,17,16.0,"I didn't like the book 1984 for many reasons. A couple of reasons would be it was a little confusing to follow and I couldn't follow along like i normally do in others books. Another reason would be that it wasn't an interesting book to read full of adventure and mystery like most books have.

1,20,31,30.0,"In my opinion the book was not really what I expected it to be. I think the book did not live up to the expectations. Someone told me that the book was about George Orwell who had a thought about what was going to happen in the future. I imagined a book with maybe 200 pages where George Orwell had written down his thoughts. But so was not the case. Instead, Orwell makes a novel about his thoughts. And that novel was not my cup of tea. I just could not enjoy the book. The language was difficult, the setting was a bit unclear and it did not content so much action.The whole story from characters, the action and the author’s choice of words did not fit together. The book did not have that effect which sucks you in to the story and keeps you in a stranglehold. I want breathtaking stories with a lot of drama and emotions. This was just a grey and boring journey through some kind of unexciting future society. No I am really disappointed, I will not remember this book as a good experience and I would never recommend it further to another person. The books gets 1 of 5 stars.",Gurkmaja

1,27,44,43.0,"Imagine living in a world where emotions such as happiness and love are outlawed and thoughts are constantly being monitored. Where your own children will turn you in to be tortured or killed and freedom of speech is totally unheard of. This is the frightening picture that George Orwell portrays as the future in 1984, the story of Winston Smith and his rebellion against a totalitarian government called “Big Brother.” Throughout the story Winston breaks away from government ideals by having an illegal affair with a mechanic named Julia and recording a journal against the ever watchful Big Brother. Although many people find the book to be bleak and depressing, George Orwell’s 1984 proved itself to be a classic because of its ability to cause the reader to question their idea of heroes, society, and symbolism. Probably the biggest reason why 1984 has remained a classic is because of its views about the progression of society. In the book a totalitarian government called the party rules society with an iron fist and an unquenchable thirst for power. “The ideal set-up by the Party was something huge, terrible, and glittering…a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting” (Orwell 64). This government and the power it holds over the minds of its citizens, forces the reader to question whether the progression of human society is a negative or positive thing.	While most may imagine a hero to be someone who is both strong both mentally and physically Orwell challenged this idea by creating Winston Smith, an anti-hero. Unlike the heroes in television and books, Winston is an overweight middle-aged man with a “varicose ulcer above his right ankle” (Orwell 1) and an inability to climb a flight of stairs. And while the thought of someone who can barely climb a set of stairs trying to overthrow an ever-watching totalitarian is somewhat laugh worthy at first, Orwell proves him to be a memorable character. With each and every chapter that passes it becomes easier and easier to relate to Winston and his somewhat flawed character and by the end of the story the reader is able to imagine themselves in Winston’s place fighting for their freedom against Big Brother. 	The last reason for why 1984 still remains popular is because of its use of symbolism. Throughout the story George Orwell uses short songs and rhymes that symbolize the fate of the main characters. When these songs and rhymes are first mentioned in the story they seem insignificant, thus causing the reader to ignore their importance. However after going back over the quotes used by George Orwell in the story it is noticed that they are actually used as tools to foreshadow the fate of the main characters. The best example of this in the book is the short song sung by Mr. Charrington, the Pawn Shop owner. “Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St. Clement’s…Here comes a candle to light you to bed, Here comes a chopper to chop off your head” (Orwell 83). At first glance this quote is insignificant but later reveals itself to foreshadow the fate of Winston and Julia, the main characters. 	Although at times dark, George Orwell’s 1984 proved itself to be a classic because of its ability to cause the reader to question their idea of heroes, society, and symbolism. For those that enjoy dystopian or just interesting books in general I would definitely recommend it. ",Eleanor

1,33,52,51.0,"If you're considering reading this book please note that it contains graphic thoughts of rape, self harm/suicide and torture. You have almost certainly encountered some of the language invented in this book in your daily life and not realised it. It must have been a game changer on many fronts.Unfortunately time dulls political satire; the use of the word comrade doesn't strike fear into my Russian-hating heart (note: I do not hate Russians), even when paired with communism that denies people such things as sugar and lemons.At the beginning during HATE WEEK Winston fantasies about raping a young girl and then killing her, which is pretty fucked up. Seriously, what the fuck, Winston. He ends up dating her, which is illegal (because the party don't like people touching each other) and also fucked up because she reacted to the line ""I wanted to rape and murder you"" with ""cool, let's get naked"".They faff about for a good while not really doing much more than talk about murder and how this girl (Julia; I'm surprised the younger generation doesn't have Russian sounding names) wants to get a real woman's dress and wear makeup, which makes me wonder if George Orwell was afraid of feminism as well and readily brought into the idea that all feminists are butch man haters, and that real women(tm) are unafraid of men who want to murder them.It isn't until half-way through the book that someone comes in to give them a purpose. They get a book, which leads to an obscenely long chapter of them reading. This book mentions that there is no racial discrimination right before going on to describe people as ""Jews, Negroes, South Americans of pure Indian blood"" which, uh, doesn't strike me as post racial, per se. It turns out that the book ruse was a distraction because, lo and behold, their purpose is ripped away from them before anything interesting happens. There's a lot in the way of torture scenes and I cared about none of it, because I couldn't forge the slightest connection to Winston. The book on a desolate note - something I'm all for, especially in this type of story - but the only thing I cared about was that, in terms of the 1984 universe, absolutely nothing happened.",Thomas

1,48,84,83.0,"[Note: I give this one star not because it was a crappy book, but because I just could not get into it. One star means ""did not like it"" on this site, not ""this book was horrible."" Big difference, and I recognize that, so don't go saying I'm an idiot or something.] Alright, the plot of any book or movie generally needs to start around the end of the first third of it; 1984's plot did not begin until the halfway point was reached. Maybe the second half of the book was better, but I wouldn't know because that's where I stopped. I was annoyed that I read half of it and still nothing of interest had yet begun. I was also pretty confused during most parts of it, but that's probably just because I'm not used to Orwell's writing style. I think the reason so many people love this book is because they think they're ""supposed"" to love it. It's a ""classic,"" as they say. People love to agree with brilliant critics and analysts because it makes them think they themselves are brilliant as well. But just because a book or movie has a cool idea to it (as in this book's case) doesn't mean that that idea was portrayed and executed well. I did enjoy ""Animal Farm,"" though.",Chris Graham

I kept expecting something to happen that could at least change the status quo of that society, so that the book would at least become a narrative of a society being transformed, but that change never came. The world ends as it started, and although it can be argued that the main character himself had a transformation at the end, it is done in such a way that it does not feel as if it happened at all.You get to finish your reading experience with a feeling that you just read a sociology textbook written on the 50's.

Βέβαια, η ανάγνωση ξεκινούσε μ' ένα μεγάλο ντεσαβαντάζ: το βιβλίο υποφέρει εκ των πραγμάτων από το φαινόμενο του παρωχημένου μέλλοντος* που για τα δικά μου γούστα είναι ένας μεγάλος ανασταλτικός παράγοντας.* δηλ. περιγράφει ένα μέλλον το οποίο παρήλθε και δεν είναι πλέον πειστικό.Επιπλέον, ακόμα και η φοβία προς τον κομουνιστικό ολοκληρωτισμό είναι μάλλον παρωχημένη. Από εκεί και πέρα η δυστοπία που περιγράφεται είναι τόσο ακραία που στα δικά μου μάτια μοιάζει με καρικατούρα. Ίσως εάν υπήρχαν κάποια άλλα στοιχεία να μπορούσε η ιστορία να ζωντανέψει και να γίνει πειστική κι ενδιαφέρουσα αλλά εγώ δεν μπόρεσα, δυστυχώς, να βρω κάτι που να εκτιμήσω.Άρχισα να πηδάω σελίδες εκεί που ο Σμιθ διαβάζει ""το βιβλίο"" γιατί το περιεχόμενό του μου φάνηκε σαν ένα αδιάφορο κατεβατό (αφού περιέγραφε μια υποτιθέμενη αλήθεια για έναν κόσμο που δεν με πείθει).

1,79,154,153.0,"The setting is London. Not that it matters. Oceania is Utopia or Panem or the Community. It is a dystopia and the story is told in third person limited, entirely from the point of view of Winston Smith. As boring and ordinary a fictional protagonist we could ask for. He is a true everyman, doing his best to muddle through each day as dictated by the supreme will of his superiors. He has a job, one meal a day and a roof over his head. Nobody questions the traditional family unit in this futuristic setting. Women have no real role except as baby makers, laundresses and exercise instructors. Nobody questions anything.For a true appreciation of 1984, watch Star Trek, TNG S6:E10-11, ""Chain of Command"" That's the way this story should've been told. There are twenty-four chapters divided into three parts for a total of 298 pages. The plot is slow to develop. Orwell spends the first ten chapters introducing Winston, setting up his world and letting us follow him around so we can truly understand just how lucky we are to have the internet, the sexual revolution and to live in the information age that Orwell could never have foreseen. In a world where everyone shares their most intimate activities and tattles on each other daily, ""Big Brother is Watching"" has become laughingly obsolete. We are Big Brother. Winston's sexual partner, Julia, is the true martyr of this political propaganda tale. She does everything for Winston: initiates the relationship, provides their first meeting place, pretties herself up for him, encourages him to rebel against Big Brother, brings him gifts like black market sugar, coffee and bread. And what does Winston do for her in return? Not much besides curing Julia of insomnia by reading aloud to her and giving them a false sense of security which ultimately betrays them thanks to Winston's complete lack of character judgment. The ability of The Party to torture and destroy a man in a quest for ultimate power is insignificant next to a man and woman's ability to create life. Since Winston never cared about his ability to procreate with his first wife and cared even less if Julia was using contraceptives and O'Brian never used sexual abuse on Winston during the torture chapters, 1984 is laughingly outdated indeed. What is the worst torture you could imagine? What is in Room 101? Besides being forced to listen to a complete recitation of The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism for any single, never married woman living in Utah, Room 101 is an LDS singles ward.

1,97,187,186.0,"As difficult as it may be to criticise a book of such immense popularity, I shall sheepishly do so nonetheless.I did not find the inner world of characters convincing at all. This novel, much like the Handmaid's Tale misses the strength of human soul...Under severe conditions people become stronger inside, all sort of things might happen on the outside, but the inner world is there and feeling of love and affection become sharper in the same way life gets sharper for those who know they have only a few years left to live. Here the characters are too bland and robotic, the author does not speak from experience but has this paranoid fantasises...If one writes about suffering for the book to be good it has to come from personal experience and Dostoevsky does that exceptionally well. If it is a science fiction book then one has to have a much better plot than Orwell demonstrates in 1984...Read the good soldier Sveik which is a historical account of the times when people had to think in a certain way and when they could be killed from saying one word wrong.

1,134,252,251.0,"In the book 1984, George Orwell was writing around the time of 1948 which is around the time after world war II and the cold war period. I think that Orwell was trying to warn all of the world what could happen if something wasn't done about the spread of communism. So he wrote this book 36 years into the future. Everything was watched what you did what you thought even a twitch of your face could give you away to the ""thought police"". Winston the main character in this story was a man who was against the ""party"". The party which was under the rule of Big Brother was a horrific thing. Their goals were for children to turn against their parents and turn people against sex and relationships with people they wanted all you attention focused on Big Brother and the party. But, foolish Winston rebeled anyway. The rebel was brought about by the beginning of an affair with a woman he met named Julia. They began having secret meetings that involved sex, coffee, tea, and bread (all illegal things). But their fun was shortlived because little did they know the thought police had been keeping a close eye on Winston for seven years. After they captured Winston he was tortured into believing the lies of the party like 2+2=4. He was eventually shot his final thoughts being ""I love Big Brother"". This book was not my favorite. Many of the parts were very slow moving and hard to follow. I would recommend it to people who are really into history and communism and all that good stuff...",Chelsea Waddell

I definitely did not expect that it would contain so much sex (though I guess if you wanted to control the world sex would be a good place to start?), when the government told him ""we shall abolish the orgasm"" I'm pretty sure I laughed until I cried (this was not supposed to be funny). The dystopian concept is interesting, but a lot of other authors have explored this type of society with more success in storytelling. I know this is a political novel, but if you're not studying politics don't read it. There is about 30 pages that does nothing other than dryly explain their whole political system.

One of the grossest lies ever forced on the American people, what a great line. Strangely, however, I find this is also a fitting description of George Orwell's 1984.I don't understand how a book this awful managed to force itself so successfully on the English-speaking/reading public. This is a truly terrible book. The crux of the story is a prolonged torture sequence, which Orwell uses as proof to show that torture and totalitarian societies can make people think whatever they want, and also, strangely, mirrors Orwell's strategy of storyteller: namely, bashing his reader over the head with the same dumb points continuously until they have no choice but to agree with him. Of course if this was the conclusion Orwell wanted his reader to arrive at I'd buy him a beer and take everything back, but I don't think that was Orwell's thought process. My sense is that Orwell was a good man who genuinely cared about humanity, but I think it's also fair to say he was an idiot. At this point, I mean. I mean it's thirty years after 1984 and seventy-five years since the book was published, and clearly the world Orwell described just didn't happen. But on top of this, Orwell himself admitted that he misinterpreted certain events during WWII, essentially saying that he confused the collapse of the British Empire with a revolution and the end of society. I mean, alright, there's plenty of problems with our current system of government, but when is it that we can all agree Orwell GOT IT WRONG, because he really did. A lot of people are talking about this recent NSA spying controversy and talking about how this proves Orwell right. I'm not saying what the NSA was doing was right, because it wasn't, but my general opinion is that anyone who says the NSA IS BIG BROTHER, ABSOLUTELY WORD FOR WORD, BIG BROTHER, is hysterical, a clown and probably never read 1984 because aside from the monitoring and data collection, there are real significant differences between 1984 Orwell society and the modern day NSA.To give Orwell credit I don't think he wrote a very good prophecy for the future, but how an individual living in a highly technologically advanced society might feel. But in that case why didn't he just set the story in Soviet era Russia or East Germany. That might've been an interesting story. My sense is that the reason Orwell didn't set the story in Russia or East Germany was that he didn't want to or was incapable of doing any research.Altogether, a shoddy, lackadaisical, lazy exercise in fiction writing.Seriously, grow up people, find a new dystopia novel. Orwell got it wrong, plain and simple. ",Neil Mckenzie-sutter

Whenever I hear that tone of aggressive don’t-you-tell-me! moral indignation, I know I’m hearing a vocal mask of bad conscience—hear it in my own voice I know it’s time to rethink seriously whatever I’ve just said.	A few years back I wrote to a National Post columnist about what I thought was a rather bizarre contention: that the trial and execution of Saddam Hussein was a triumph of natural justice. Her reply turned on that sentence: “I live in the real world”—a world, apparently, in which natural justice can embrace the assassination of three consecutive defence attorneys—no doubt to encourage the fourth—and, in general, trial proceedings that—I kid you not, look up the news reports of the time if you don’t believe me—resembled nothing so much as those of the Red Queen’s court in Alice in Wonderland. Apparently we’ve been wrong about Lewis Carroll all this time; he was actually a naturalist in the manner of Emile Zola.	Of course Lewis Carroll was writing about the real world—aspects of it I should say, that’s all any of us can claim—telling the truth but telling it slant as Emily Dickinson put it. Thought I don’t think the word totalitarian had been coined yet, the court of the Red Queen strikes me as a far more astute vision of totalitarianism than George Orwell’s 1984. Orwell imagines a middle level bureaucrat like O’Brien could be a philosopher prince—or is forced to pretend he does, since otherwise he can’t get out the reams and reams of argument he has to fall back on, lacking the skill to show the intricate apparatus of totalitarianism—instead he has to turn a character into his mouthpiece, improbably and at whew! length, so he can tell tell tell you what he thinks. It’s what happens when you send an impatient schoolmaster to do a novelist’s job (and his fervid misrepresentation of Gulliver’s Travels shows he was equally as capable a misreader of novels).	None of the attendants at the Red Queen’s court pauses in frenzied action to give a solemn exposition of its inner workings at a hundred pages’ length—the chop logic they speak very frequently conveys sense (hidden from themselves), but their words don’t explain the social order—they reveal it. So do their actions—principally variations of running around like chickens with their heads cut off, mainly in the devout hope that they can thereby prevent their actual heads from being, you know, actually cut off. Motions of that kind—paranoid, frenetic, scrabbling—are constant in Stalin’s Russia as well—from the lowest level at its outer to the highest level at its inner circle. A middle manager like O’Brien in such a maelstrom will have little time to concentrate his thoughts , what with the huge proportion of every working day and restless sleeping night that must be given over to metaphorically, and on some occasions perhaps literally (state occasions I’d be inclined to say, but that may be editorializing) pissing his pants with fear.	The curious thing about the columnist who argued the Red Queen’s court was an admirable model of natural justice is that she’s interesting and provocative—on the euthanasia movement, feminism and men’s rights, the rising tide of anti-semitism in polite society and (perhaps most worrying) public schools—whenever she engages with the world around her. Her occasional book reviews are a delight—where the subject isn’t overtly political—because she has far more practical aesthetic sense than most professional reviewers. It’s only when alarmist tendencies send her back to the entrenched redoubt of living in the real world that she ever talks solemn nonsense, as in a recent column commending realists (rightists) and savaging dreamers (leftists) in our society for their respective views on militant Islam. Apart from the fact that it was right-wing realists whose dream of miring the Soviet Union in Afghanistan precipitated the exponential leap forward in power and militancy of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, this is a classic example of an either /or question—“Are you a realist or a dreamer?”—that can only be coherently answered “Yes”. It’s possible to criticize a particular dream on any number of counts—it’s wishy-washy; too aggressively self-centred; so unfocussed it has no centre at all; seems high sounding and noble but would lead in practice to self-replicating (self-exploding) nightmares—but it’s pointless to criticize (or praise) anyone for being a dreamer if it’s impossible to discover a single example of a human being who isn’t.",Martin

1,159,287,286.0,"I did not like this book at all.

I get Orwell's idea, I get that it was written in the 40's but I just don't get why so many people love this book. It starts ok but then you have 40 pages of Goldstein's book that take you out of the novel completely and then it ends.

1,161,290,289.0,"1984, by George Orwell, was a tough read for me. I'm not sure whether I was born too late to relate to the language of Orwell's time period; or if I came to it with high expectations, following Christpher Hitchens frequent praise of Orwell's work. Whatever it was, I hate this novel and early on it became a real chore to read. I spent the majority of the novel telling myself, “One more chapter and it will pick up. One more chapter and it will be worth it,” yet it never did pick up and I finished it sorely disappointed. The torture scenes at the end of the book paled in comparison to the torture the author made me go through. I just wanted to call it quits but persevered out of my own stubbornness.In short: the book is slow, painstakingly so; The characters are boring; the dialogue is fleeting and mind-numbingly pointless when it does make an appearance; the ending is unsatisfactory. The book is more of a statement than a story; a good example of why an idea by itself doesn't guarantee a good read. Safe to say this has firmly put me off reading any other books by this author. Don't trust any five star reviews like I did. Reviewers are either just beginning to venture into the world literature and are yet to strike gold, or they think classics can do no wrong and deserves a higher rating.Would not recommend.",Sean

Winston is very selfish, as is Julia. All anyone in this novel cares about is their own skin. Don't get me wrong, I think it's good to have ""flawed"" characters.

I couldn't find a reason why I should read a detailed description and a critique of a fictional totalitarian society that does not exist, and it is unlikely to exist in the future (although you may never know). I have better ways to waste my free time. This book might have been useful, even brilliant, in 1949 when it was first published, but it's obsolete now.To make it even worse, there is also a very unconvincing love story between two unlikeable characters.Of course this novel is a valuable warning against being brainwashed by propaganda, or about the importance of preserving history, or the dangers of being watched by our government, blah blah blah...; but still, there is nothing here I haven't heard before.",Simone

It was boring and tedious with the rants and explanations of the system of government. The characters (with the exception of the main character, Winston) were underdeveloped and for the most part uninteresting. There were moments here and there that the story began to get interesting, but then it really didn't go anywhere or the situation was resolved quickly.

1,256,459,458.0,"1984 was not one of my favorite books to read in school. We read this my sophomore year of high school, and I found myself very confused half of the time. Someone's view of a book depends on their interests and qualities they look for in a ""good"" book. Basically, everyone has their own definition of a good book. For me, books that are solemn and don't really bring out any positive emotions in a reader can be depressing. Now, for 1984, I understand there were a lot of underlying assumptions within the text. For example, Big Brother was a symbol for the government. Big Brother is portrayed as a controlling, manipulative, and somewhat terrible ""thing."" It's more of an idea than an actual person or people. Basically, the citizens of Airstrip One all did what they were supposed to and obeyed this higher power. Although I didn't seem to really enjoy it while in high school, it is a little bit interesting when you think of this time period with English socialism. When you try to imagine yourself inside the book and as Winston Smith, the protagonist, it becomes a little more fascinating. Also, learning that George Orwell wrote it in 1948 and it was his take on the future makes you dig even deeper while reading. Now that I have furthered my education and have a better understanding of symbolism and vocabulary, I might consider taking another stab at reading 1984.",Karyn Buibish

I disliked Winston as a character, hated Big Brother and The party. If I had lived in the 50's and read this book I still don't believe that I would have found it disturbing or thought provoking, simply because I believe that humans will always have compassion towards one another, even if there is war happening in many places around the world. When it came to the parts with Winston reading 'the book', I had to skip those pages as what I did read was a repeat of what had already been written in the novel 1984, and I had had enough of the repetitive descriptions and dialogue. My first real joy came when Winston was locked in the Ministry of Love(what fucked up kind of name is that for a prison, seriously Orwell this is what you came up with?), and he was thinking of the bullet entering his brain through the back of his skull. I was hoping in the next chapter that it would happen and I would not need to read anymore, but no alas he survives and miraculously loves Big Brother.

Winston's job is to distort or doctor the truths and facts that may contradict the Party.Discontent with his monitored life, he begins to secretly write in a journal which encourages him to think with critical analyses that would be viewed heretical by the Party. In addition, he meets Julia which they initiate sexual escapades, also in secret.Predictably, Winston and Julia are captured by the Party. Winston goes through torture to which the Party oversees in order to condition him back to Party's mission and beliefs. The plot is fairly simplistic but with redundant lines.

I rate it alongside all Ayn Rand books- in the exact same vein it goes on and on preaching against this imaginary political- economic system- some sort of communism + plus ultra security. The meandering of the theology goes on for so long, you cannot get attached to the characters at all- even lesser than you would in Fountainhead. But honestly, I cannot stand these books with all those philosophizing about freedom and government repression where authors take some sort of moral highground of Western philosophy and write as if they have discovered the secret to an ideal society and ideal government system. Perhaps adding to this, is also the fact that I read this book in 2015 and not earlier. By now we have been so inundated in the media about the evils of both communism and heightened surveillance you cannot help but be bored by this same repetition. More to the point- living in the real world we are exposed daily to some of the real horrors being committed by governments of all kinds- China, US, Afghanistan and the Middle East that you cannot help but feel this is some feeble horror of a worst case scenario. Certainly- after the mess of the Middle East you feel like neither does the Western World who created this mess have any right to any moral high ground and writing these preachy books about the real nature of freedom, nor indeed the East with the horrors committed against people and especially women everyday.

However, when you take into account the context in which this book was written, the political implications that come along with it, and when the character of Orwell himself are taken into consideration, the book's counter-revolutionary nature is revealed. Written by George Orwell, a man who at the height of the Nazi onslaught that resulted in the death of 28 million of the Soviet people, he declared that “willingness to criticize Russia and Stalin is the test of intellectual honesty. It is the only thing that from a literary intellectual’s point of view is really dangerous”, wrote 1984 above all as a political statement.

I regret every hour I lost in reading this, truly. The world made NO sense, contradictions abound and every other detail just had me thinking, ""really?! Big Brother let that slip, that's going to bite them in the ass one day and they don't even realize!"" That's just unbelievable, that such a supposedly all-powerful totalitarian state could make such simple mistakes, that weren't even acknowledged as mistakes in the narrative. It says miles about how lazy Orwell was about the finer details of his worldbuilding.The romance was bland as fuck and disturbing to boot. Over and over again I wanted to strangle Winston, and the only reason Julia is at all suited to him is because they're both terrible people. Utterly terrible. The amount of classism in this book made me feel ill, frankly, and I can't understand why anyone would want to write such a dreary, hopeless book. The only characters I actually liked were killed off.I just cannot comprehend how this book became so big. I can't. It's terrible. That's all I can say.",Emeline

1,347,635,634.0,1984 was a novel about the totalitarian government. George Orwell wrote this novel as a warning to the people that the government might one day strip them of their rights. I didn't like this novel because the ending was freaky and a tad anticlimactic. The rats were a weird touch. It was way over done and over the top during the bulk of the novel and jam packed but the ending was awful. It was revolutionary for the time however. The main character did a complete 180 with his personality and made it difficult to render him dynamic or static. The woman in the novel named Julia was shallow and I didn't like her. Her note to him essentially asking for sex seemed fine but afterwards through her manners and such she showed herself as a poor representation for women. This novel was meant as a warning but it was more of a badly written complaint.,Andrea Bomalaski

Only when you get to part 3 and see what horror is in store for those who enter room 101 does the book's plot start to pick up the pace, but then all of the sudden the book became a snoozer and to cap it all off the good guy losses that wasn't right the bad guys always get theirs in movies, TV and books the good guys are always supposed to win that was the most disappointing thing about 1984. Despite my feelings of frustration with this book the narrator for the audio book did a very good job. I think you can never go wrong when you have a British narrator,but it wasn't just his cool accent that made the book great many narrators have that but a great narrator can put the emotion of the moment into his words. When the book is at a scary part the narrator's tone lets you knnow that and when Winston was in pain and crying the narrator put that sense of pain and crying into his voice that really brought the book to life.

At times, real life events do have a resemblance to fiction.Our leading character, Winston works for a department of the Ministry of Truth. Proles are the working class people that Winston thinks and/or voices his opinion about. He spoke out loud his thoughts in a room he assumed was safe. He stated that “these people will become a race of conscious beings”. This was considered a thoughtcrime which causes him and his lover, Julia, to be hauled away to the Ministry of Love and endured tortured for their correction and/or conversion process. This place is a windowless building in which there is no darkness because the lights are always on and never turned off. Charrington, a Thought Police Enforcer and O’Brian are both higher up in the “The Party” regime and controls all records and human memory. They take great pleasure in the torture of others to keep them in line and to “correct” their thinking.While held captive at the Ministry of Love, Winston finds that Parsons, a neighbor is also there because he was denounced by his young daughter for a thoughtcrime; she heard him said that he hated “ Big Brother” in his sleep one night so she reported him to the authorities. In this world, it is believed that reality “exists” only in the “Party” and not in the individual human mind. Only the “Party” holds the truth. Winston is reminded that he is not here to be punished, but to be “cured” and converted. This correction went on for weeks. O’Brian ordered that Winston be taken to Room 101 for the ultimate correction. Finally, at his wits end, Winston is forced to abandon his beloved Julia; turning against her to save himself.

1,406,734,733.0," Brilliant books require plenty of insight and creative thought to spark the readers inquisitive nature. George Orwell's 1984 clearly lacked a lot of this. His depiction of a militant society that exploits terrorism and has plunged into regressions was a product of absolute folly. Furthermore, his diction and attempt to keep a common thread of logic flowing through his characters failed to express itself legitimately and resulted in an obtuse depiction. His creation of a hierarchy society that is constantly monitored and treated poorly by the state was a failure to pass the precinct that typical authors stay within. The senseless drama and needless exertion of Orwell's theme of mass surveillance proved to be excessive and a dull read.  The main characters in the story, Winston, O'Brian, and Julia, all share the desire to escape their governments grasp. In particular, Winston is the protagonist against the malign nature of The Party. That being the government, which attempts to control every aspect of human life through manipulation of the press, in citizens speech, and in new technological advances. It is this aspect of having a totalitarian government dictating over human life that rankles me. Orwell's word choice made the reading too extreme and rid itself of the reason that creates sound books.  This absence was accompanied by a simpleminded girl, Julia, who came into contact with Winston and fell in love with him. Their love affair in the massive surveillance society faced a multitude of obstacles and plenty of close calls with the government, but Found a way to manage besides coming into close contact with The Party. Again, on topic of love , Orwell fails to utilize the profundity behind this awesome abstraction. In particular, the highs and lows of their relationship created droll paroxysms that left the reader discombobulated at the abrupt scenes. These abnormalities in the structure of Orwell's writing lacked a tenacious quality and failed to hold the book together. This deficit was neither noticed or atoned for by Orwell's meaning in the obscurity between the lines within the pages of his book.  Next, Orwell's attempt to manifest the liberation of the individual was nebulous and difficult to notice within the black and white comprised in his writing style. Winston being the individual, an alleged intellectual who is exhibiting the erratic qualities which his socialistic society is against. His contempt and aloofness towards Big Brother, the head of The Party, is ridiculed by most of the citizens and disregarded by The Party. It is Winston's strive that is revered to by the book and treated as the sign of a desire to keep the ego. Here, Orwell established another primary theme, but didn't format the notion in an order that flows. Such an action took away important aspects of the books theme and and sullied an opportunity to explain a valuable aspect of modern day ideology. Overall, Orwell selected a profound theme with various ramifications, but failed to explain his perspective due to vapid diction and a dull writing style which reached to entirely predictable scenes. Though I would recommend looking into the theme of mass surveillance society, I wouldn't search for it in the horrendous style that comprised Orwell's writing.",Daniel Gomez

1,413,741,740.0,"George Orwell comletely ripped off his 1984 from Yevgeny Zamyatin 's We (published in 1921)Yevgeny Zamyatin 's We novel is much better. I recommend it to everyone who liked 1984 Zamyatin E.МыFirstly, language and other stylistic and symbolic aspects are much better: We contains religious implications (references to the Bible) which 1984 is lacking. Commonly, countries with totalitarian regime forbid people to have any religious views.Secondly, We is a story written by the real witness of creating of totalitarian regime (Bolshevism-Leninism-Stalinism) and personality cult (subsequently depersonalized and called Big Brother) or by allegedly a main character (as you wish).Thirdy, it is a fact that Orwell has read We before writing 1984. And lets be frank Orwell has completely swiped the plot of the story with its major details.Eventually,that is why it is easy to notice that We more truly depicts people`s life though it is anti-utopia.",Elen Neuve

1,454,815,814.0,"1984 is the classic dystopian novel. It tells the story of Winston and his life in the authoritarian regime of Oceania. All activity is monitored and the story revolves around Winston’s rebellion. The novel is packed with symbolism and metaphors. If you into stories with deep meaning, then this is really the book for you. Otherwise, you will get tired of the political manifesto that plagues this novel. Many of the novel’s theme involve personal liberties and freedoms. Although Orwell tries to be meaningful, the story and the characters are not charming or personable at all. Indeed, the creepiest part of the novel was Winston’s fascination with a younger woman. I was not a fan.

The psychological portrayal is decent, but the dystopian vision is one-dimensional & the evolution, particularly the last few chapters, was for me farcical & utterly unbelievable, as well as completely non-instructive/constructive.

I didn't recall it too well since I'd read it in high school (a loooong time ago). For the first 3/4 of the book, I was interested. It's a grim, grim tale, but it's a powerful one, written soon after WWII. I was very surprised at how much sex there was in it; I didn't remember that at all. I also was reading it this time always conscious of how a 13-year-old might react to it. I can't see how kids that age would get through the book. It seems to me that it would bore them enormously. Moreover, I think the sex, while it might at first titillate, would be disturbing since it is grim and unpleasant: sex is seen as an act of revolt against the Party rather than as an act of love. In fact, there is little joy in the first 3/4 of the book. However, the last quarter was unreadable for me. The violence, humiliation, and terror that Winston & the other prisoners are put through were unbearable.

1,498,909,908.0,"It is apparent by this book that George Orwell is highly intelligent. The society spoken of in this book must have taken a lot of figuring out, looking at every angle with which one might be able to dispute the likelihood that a society as Oceania could evolve and come up with a reasonable argument to support his idea. He did very good at that.However, I couldn't stand this book. It was depressing throughout. I kept hoping for something uplifting, and never found it. I thought the end might turn around into something that showed Man's spirit triumphs, but it did not. I was terribly disappointed.This is not to say that others would not like the book. It is very well-written and did keep my interest, and some might like the deep thinking that it induces. I did not. Call me a shallow thinker. ;)Several times the book brings out the fact that there were no laws; but contradicted it by having consequences to actions, words, thoughts, and feelings that were not allowed. Are those not laws? They didn't call it punishments, but re-training. I didn't buy that.Big Brother was supposed to be watching your every move, listening to your every word, even being able to know what you're thinking by the smallest twitch in your expression. Poppycock! I just don't see how it would be humanly possible to have a person behind every person's telescreen. And then you would have to have a person watching every person who is watching a person, and so forth. Yes, we could argue about that from this story's point of view, but it really isn't logical in the real world we live in.I also didn't understand not being allowed to write. There were exceptions, but I still wonder if children were taught to write in school or not. This seemed contradictory.I also thought his betrayal of Julia was weak. That part of the story just didn't jive with me.I find it very unbelievable, too, to think that a society could reduce their language's vocabulary to such a narrow range as suggested in this story. Even if they succeeded, it would begin to grow again, because people make new words to describe thoughts and feelings not found in other words. Sure, if everyone was truly brainwashed into only using those words, it might be possible; but then, that is another thing I disagree with - not every human being can be brainwashed into the model this story suggests; there would always be those where logic would rule. And let's not even talk about the Light of Christ.These are just some of the things I found not plausible. I feel Orwell cheated, too, when he was able to explain his theory by introducing ""The Book"" and then having Winston read from it. While it gave a quick understanding to the audience as to Orwell's theory of this Big Brother society, in my judgment it was cheap, not to mention dry and boring.It is inconceivable to think that man can be reduced to a purely mechanical mentality. Orwell takes the spirit out of man, takes his agency or freedom to choose away, and takes emotion and all that makes man a man, and turns them into biological robots. If that were the case, man could not survive. I wish I had the vocabulary to use words that could really describe how I feel about this book. Even though I use Oldspeak, I still don't have the ability to put my feelings into words. How ironic!",Alice
1,499,911,910.0,"It is hard to really like 1984 after reading Мы (We), the Russian classic dystopian science fiction written by Zamyatin E. in the 1920s. 1984's plot is almost completely copied from We (Orwell admits he was ""inspired,"" though frankly, he might as well have said it was copied scene by scene, character by character, for 3/4 of the book), but what made We compelling were lost. The fluid narrative with its absurdly mathematical references were watered down, taking away from the intensity of the change for the protagonist when he falls in love. In Orwell's defense, 1984's more ordinary narrative is more relateable, and the anguish and physical discomfort experienced by the main character **spoiler alert** during the torture scene later in the novel **spoiler end** comes through in a way We isn't able to convey as vividly.

By no account was there a futuristic society involving some omniscient leader named ""Big Brother."" If this is a stab at Ronald Reagan then as a devoted American citizen, I am highly insulted. And it obviously takes place in the US (they all speak American English), so don't attempt to contradict me by saying it could be Communist Russia or the People's Republic of China. I wasn't in the least ""challenged"" by the book as all my colleagues predicted I would be; in fact my intellect was insulted by the lack of research put into this novel. Obviously this George Orwell is some punk kid out of college who wasn't even alive in the 80s and is preaching about something he did not even experience. Obviously this Orwell spent his high school years playing hooky and smoking the reefer instead of attending his History class, a utility that would have greatly benefited the writing of this novel.",Eddy Allen

To be fair I was going to give it a 2 star, one for me opening and one for me finishing the book.. however it really lost that second star when I started reading the appendix and actually felt suicidal it was that boring and depressing!! Reviewing the book itself.... what a drag! The only time it got interesting was towards the end. I won't say why for those poor people who will read this it's the only decent bit and I don't want to spoil it! I know I'm being harsh but to be honest it's only got the one star as I made myself suffer to the end in the small hope it would get better!! This book is slow and boring for me, some OK concepts but that's pushing it. Couldn't wait to finish so I could read something better like the back of a bleach bottle.

1,518,946,945.0,"Contains Spoilers!I'm not very political, so I choose not to review this book on those grounds. People will argue that that's the whole point of the book. If that's what you care about, then read another review. My objective is to review it on the basis of books in general: was it worth reading? My answer to that is no. It starts off well enough, focusing on Winston, the world around him, and his interactions with and within it. It actually develops well enough that I became excited to find out what happens to Winston and Julie and become emotionally attached to their situation. Then when I expect the next logical progression of the plot, they meet O'Brien, and they get the book. This is where the book goes totally off the rails and turns into (in my opinion) a piece of shit. Winston reads from the book. And at that point I begin to realize I'm reading about a character reading about a subject that 1) I don't care about 2) Is presented like a dissertation to be presented for scholarly review and 3) Totally cuts through the story Orwell was weaving and ruins any momentum he had generated to that point. And the worst part about it is, after throwing up his political perspectives in my face, he has his character directly acknowledge that the book ""had not told him anything that he did not know, it had merely systematized the knowledge that he possessed already."" One could argue that we the reader already had a decent idea of how Oceania worked before Orwell drove the story into the ditch, so why do it? The remainder of the book seemed more to me a walkthrough of how, through torture, you can utterly destroy the mind and spirit of another human being. I didn't particularly care for it. I had lost my connection to the story and this walkthrough wasn't enough to get me to re-engage with it. I finished the book feeling angry and cheated of my time. If anyone would care to inform me of what it is I'm missing that makes this book so widely adored and required reading in many school systems, I'd greatly appreciate. As it stands, my suspicion is that most say they like it to feel superior, intelligent, and an accepted part of the majority. What a waste. ",Rich Thornton

1,523,961,960.0,"I wanted to read this book for quite some time, just to see what all the fuss is about. I expected a lot from it since it's a ""must-read"", a classic and so many people's favorite book. Having now finally read it, I have to say I don't see what is so special about it. In my opinion, it's actually pretty bad as a whole. Contents: I was quite impressed at the beginning of the book, what with all the control over people and its similarity to today's surveillance issues (remember NSA?). But from that point on things just started to get silly and way too exaggerated. 1. Changing history. Yes, the history is usually written by winners, but is it not nearly as subjective as this book wants us to believe + how could everyone just forget something happened? Which leads to 2., brainwashing. Yes, it happens, but to this extent? I don't believe all the people can be brainwashed (although this is precisely what Orwell wants to show with Winston, that pitiful bastard). Then no genuine relationships between people; newspeak; thoughtcrimes... And the final disappointment: Winston converting. Despite all his previous scepticism, doubt and arguments he not only embraces Ingsoc regime, but actually starts to love Big Brother. Love, like he has never loved anyone before! This spineless creature makes me sick. So all in all, the contents did not convince me. Writing style: Oh, my god, where do I start. The first part of the book seemed to be 700 pages long. It just wouldn't end. When things started happening with Julia, I thought ""this is it"" but was only let down again by all the awkward scenes. If this isn't the clumsiest way to describe sex I don't know what is. The last part of the book was a total opposite to the first: it all happened so fast. Even the important scenes (like Winston's imprisonment) were so poorly described and all of a sudden it was five years later. Are you kidding me? Final verdict: This book is bad literature and there are many, many better books worth picking up. As to the (supposed) parallels between this book and today's reality: despite all the conspiracy theories etc. I refuse to draw them. I refuse to believe the world can be so corrupt and humanity so weakly. The thought that whole populations could actually be reduced to this is frankly insulting. ",Manca

1,526,967,966.0,"Winston is a middle aged man who lives in present day London. He is a regular member of society, meaning that there is nothing that really separates him from others. Winston currently lives under a totalitarian government, which rules by fear and harsh punishments. No one ever thinks about going against them, until one day Winston finds an old diary and decides to write his thoughts in it, which is a crime punishable by death. Throughout the book Winston is constantly trying to do anything and everything he can to go against the government, all without them finding out. I didn't like the book mainly because there wasn't very much speaking, the author just went into extreme detail about everything.

1,529,976,975.0,"Hmm... Okay so I'm sure that many people have gone before me and wrote extremely intelligent reviews about how this book is so timeless and still relates to the present worlds politics and how it's so well written for it's time and basically just how wonderful it is but I'm not going to write a review like that. I was disappointed to be honest.I found the characters to be lacking any interesting personality traits. The whole concept of the world they were living in was confusing a lot of the time and I hated the ending. The ending usually makes or breaks a book for me. I personally like things to be tied up nice and neatly with all subplots and major plots alike come to complete close. Only if the book is one in a series do I tolerate anything else. So I did not enjoy the ending of this book.Of course there were good things about this book too, it wouldn't make it onto dozens of best books lists if there weren't some appealing things about it. I liked the fact that it was written in 1948 about the future, 1984 obviously, and how the author had come up with this possible world we could have all been living in. I'm not sure if you can call it a post-apocalyptic or dystopian future as there doesn't seem to have been any major disaster or pandemic but it is a completely different world all the same so it's defiinitely post-something. I don't know, I'm actually trying really hard to think of something else good to write about this novel but I'm failing miserably. I feel like because it's such a classic that I should like it but I apologise to any Orwell fans out there as this was a brutal disappointment in my eyes. There were too many confusing twists, the whole Party ideal was ridiculous and also extremely confusing at the best of times (don't get me started on DOUBLETHINK) and the characters lacked appeal.",Laura Crosse

1,534,983,982.0,"Se dicessi che ho capito questo libro, esagererei; se dicessi che mi è piaciuto mentirei. Eppure qualche cosa, qualche piccolissima cosa, mi ha lasciato. Già solo le date di inizio e fine la dicono lunga sulla mia svogliatezza nel girare queste pagine, ma quando mi impongo di leggere un libro, normalmente, che mi piaccia o no, mi impongo anche di terminarlo. Stavolta è stata davvero dura ed a un certo punto ho detto “ok, ti lascio un po’ sul comodino”. Le ultime cento pagine le ho lette negli ultimi 4 giorni; a saperlo prima, finivo mesi fa. Di fatto c’è che mi ha annoiato e molto. Non ho mai amato Orwell come autore… ma per averne consapevolezza dovevo leggere qualcosa di suo, partendo dalla “Fattoria degli animali” ed arrivando al tanto conclamato 1984. Che noia! E che angoscia! So che un libro ha la metà del suo contenuto legato al contesto e sicuramente estrapolarlo non è mai una buona idea, però, sinceramente, è un libro di un sadico. Ne ho letti di libri di torture e massacri, di stragi e di terrorismo n’è colma l’Europa come l’America Latina, l’Africa come l’Asia. Ma c’è una grossa differenza tra queste storie vere e il libro di Orwell: il sadismo. Questo libro emana una cattiveria infinita e sembra quasi che l’idea che si trasmette sia quella di esaltare tutto questo, invece che deplorarlo. Non è per la fine, ci sta anche un po’ di realismo: quando mai vedete il bene trionfare sul male? Mai. Il realismo ci sta. Ma tutto questo sadismo meno. Le prime cento pagine sono state un’agonia, una lunghissima agonia girata intorno a Winston Smith, unico (o quasi) protagonista del libro, se escludiamo il Grande Fratello. Il mondo di Winston è un mondo diviso in tre parti, in guerra tra loro: Estasia Eurasia ed Oceania, patria di Smith. In Oceania esiste il Partito e l’occhio del Grande Fratello che guarda tutto e tutti sempre, 24h su 24. Guai a discostarsi da quello che secondo il partito è vero e giusto! La Psicopolizia (che ricorda molto le Squadre della Morte argentine) entra in azione. Ma come si fa a credere in qualcosa che ogni cinque minuti viene adattato e cambiato a seconda della esigenza? Nel mondo dell’Oceania non esiste il passato: questo infatti viene riscritto ogni giorno, è in continuo mutamento ed in continuo adattamento… ma sempre in linea con il partito. Il Partito è l’unica certezza. Nel mondo di Winston non c’è spazio per nulla, le giornate sono rigidamente scandite, ben regolamentate e regolate; con un occhio sempre puntato addosso non è facile scappare da questa regolarità che, se infranta, porta alla morte. O almeno per una parte della popolazione; per il 90% di essa, invece, la Psicopolizia non esiste nemmeno. Sono i prolet, il gradino più basso, l’incarnazione della degradazione e dell’ignoranza, personificazione dell’inutilità. Capisco il pessimismo di quegli anni, ma questo mondo, ribadisco, è proprio eccessivamente sadico. Senza contare che in tutto il libro i discorsi filosofeggianti di Orwell non fanno una piega, se si segue il suo filo, ma c’è una pecca: dov’è il bandolo della matassa? Dove è cominciato il filo logico? A metà del libro c’è una lunga lettura di Winston, il quale viene in possesso di un libro pericolosissimo, di quella che potremmo chiamare la resistenza, un libro nel quale si smaschera in Grande Fratello per quello che è; in questa parte l’autore regala perle di saggezza sull’evoluzione delle masse, sul progresso, sui cicli storici, arrivando poi a dimostrare come sia possibile che il regno della dittatura Oceanica non finisca mai… si ma senza contare quel gradino iniziale che spieghi come tutto quello che Winston vive sia stato realizzabile che è molto diverso dal dimostrare come in realtà possa sopravvivere a tutto. Non credo nell’assoluta imbecillità dell’intera umanità nello stesso momento; disgraziatamente al mondo esistono le dittature e grazie a Dio finiscono, che mietono un’infinità di vite e costano molti sacrifici che si ripercuotono sulle generazioni successive. La gente (tutta) però, ad un certo punto, desidera la pace talmente tanto che è in grado di ripristinarsela a forza. E la gente scontenta è sempre di più, rispetto a quella contenta. Variabile non indifferente.Senza questionare oltre sulle teorie di Orwell, vi dirò che a un certo punto Winston viene scoperto, viene accusato di essere contro al Partito e viene catturato. Essere catturati dalla Psicopolizia significa due cose: essere torturati e morire, perché il ribelle va prima distrutto, poi ricostruito ed infine eliminato. Questa sarà la sorte che attende il nostro protagonista, insieme al quale vivremo l’angoscia del torturato, la paura e la sofferenza, l’egoismo di chi per amore della propria vita è disposto a sacrificare il mondo intero. Mors tua vita mea. Indubbiamente c’è poco da giudicare in questo atteggiamento.Non è un libro che consiglierei, però forse leggendolo vi rimarrà qualcosa, qualcosa che non saprete cos’è né come chiamare ma pur sempre qualcosa. Alla fine l’importante, per un libro, è lasciare la traccia dentro di noi.",Ileen

I’ve never hated a book so much in my entire life.News for you: This book is written by a jaded, old, crabby man who became disillusioned with communism. That’s right, disillusioned, meaning at one time, he thought highly of it, but it didn’t go his way. Why? because communism never does.In the year 2016, everyone thinks Ted Cruz and Trump are raging lunatics who place fear at the top of their agenda to scare everyone their way. Turns out, Orwell is that same guy. He’s the antithesis of an intelligent doomsday prepper, suffering from paranoia, hiding from Chem Trails. Also, if you haven’t read much about him, I recommend taking a glance at his Wikipedia page, and you can see for yourself that he was an asshole who thought highly of himself and his views.This book is long and it’s boring and it’s meant more than anything stir up fear about the Russians in a Cold War era.

Afraid of Bush-era Republican America? Sure. That's in here somewhere, I bet. Terrified of Obama-Stalin leftist death panels? Why not. I bet that's in here somewhere.

That book was just... so...BOOOOOOOOOO-RING!I started reading this book because it's a known ""classic"" and considered to be very good by many people.It took me FOREVER to read it, because it was so dull (though I'm pretty sure some blame goes on the translator).The last chapter of the book (which is roughly 50 pages long...) was somewhat interesting on a psychological level, but until that point, it felt like I was reading a detailed ""historical"" description of how the world came to be in a messed up state of ""Big Brother Government"", where everybody's monitored and there are no things like joy or human interaction. This was made in a VERY boring, uninteresting and depressing way, side-by-side with the ""story"" of Winston, a worker of the government who begins having thoughts of revolt. This ""main plot"" of Winston, however, was poorly done and meant nothing more but to give a personal insight for the reader to emphasize with, as a foundation on which Orwell can present his made-up and over-the-top Big Brother regime. Orwell was probably a lot more enthusiastic on giving a detailed description of this new-possible-future he has thought of, and as a result, Wilson's ""story"" is very shallow and... well, stupid.Besides that, I really like ""possible futures"" genre, but the world Orwell describes feels too farfetched and impossible to actually occur, a thing that really threw me away from enjoying the read.This is NOT a book to read for its plot. The plot itself is just BAD.However, if you can enjoy a detailed description of a universe in which the ""Big Brother Government"" has taken its hold on the people, read this. There are several extreme thoughts and ideas in this book that can really make you think about things like human interaction and what it is to be lead blindly by a selfish government.I, personally, just started skimming whole pages of the book...",Ori Pilo Kerman

It's little more than confirmation bias for the politically disaffected. Orwell, George does a great job of making us feel hella hopeless and futile, but he insists on doing so through a draggy and oft uncomfortable narrative. That's it though. It's not an anarchist's anthem, it's not a communist's mid-revolution pick-me-up; it's a book that paints a picture of a mildly sickening alternate reality, but a reality far less sickening than the one we actually live in.",Carly Casper
1,606,1111,1110.0," When I was told that I could read 1984 by George Orwell for my CP English final, I was extremely excited. As I started reading, I became less and less excited about it. The novel is George Orwell’s pessimistic view of the future if totalitarianism continued around the world. The novel’s main character, Winston Smith, is a man that has become fed up with the oppressive world he lives in, but is too pathetic to do anything about it. Eventually he meets a young girl that is in love with him, and the two meet in secret locations, and despite knowing very little about one another, they make love. They meet only a few times until they are captured by a secret police organization known as The Thought Police. They are captured because premarital sex is against the law. Winston and his colleague Julia are imprisoned, and after a long period of time, during which he is tortured, Winston is let out of prison after he confesses to his past crimes, even though he actually did nothing wrong. After a few days of freedom, Winston is killed by the Thought Police. Despite the novel being considered a classic, I did not like it. I did not like the novel for a few reasons. The first reason is the fact that it seem a little unrealistic. In 1984 even thinking about doing something illegal can get you arrested and even killed. That to me, is just something that could never happen. There is no way that a government could find a way to read people’s minds. Also there are television-like devices called telescreens, which enable government agents to spy on people in their homes and just about everywhere, even the restroom. That to me is just creepy to me to think that someone is always watching someone. The final thing I do not like about the novel is the fact that it is a little long. Sure Orwell had to develop the characters and the plot, but it just gets a little dry because of the length. I did not like the novel, but I am just not a fan of post apocalyptic themed literature, so if you want to read it go right ahead. ",Nate

1,612,1124,1123.0,"I once had a really inane and unintelligent review here that drew some trolls and unwanted attention, so I took down that review because I generally hate any kind of negativity and it makes me extraordinarily anxious to have any kind of criticism (constructive or destructive) pop up on my ticker feed on a semi-regular basis (I don't really need that); and it's especially disheartening when that criticism deals with a book that so many intelligent people love. I hope that one day I will return to this book and really grasp what it is that so many people love about it, but until that day, I suppose I can continue bashing it to the discomfort of all of us. My main issue at the time was that the book wanted to argue about these political ideas through a story, and it left me wondering why a story was even necessary in the first place. I think I was pretty reductive in my approach to works that combine artistic expression and politics. However I thought that if the author really wanted to convey a point about a political or social issue, why not resort to the good old, syllogism and debate format? I think the answer to this should be obvious; it should make me look blatantly particularly provocative for having made that point. The reason why it’s a book is because it has reached such a wider audience as a work of fiction, than if it were to be a political essay (which probably would reach only a handful of those in academia and those working in that field of study). It’s hard to deny the impact that this book has had, and how many people it's reached. Who doesn’t use the terms “double-think” or “big brother” when discussing any issues involving oppressive bureaucratic systems, or other similarly related issues? (This doesn’t change that the fact that the book has really boring characters and the writing is bland as hell (and it especially doesn’t change the fact that I love literature that is focused on character and language which is well out of Orwell’s wheelhouse, but I can’t hate on Mr. Orwell too much because the late, great Bonnie, had such affection for him and let’s face it: she was a far more intelligent and thoughtful reader than I was or will be!))It was aspects of its simplicity that I resisted. And not just the simplicity of prose and character, but the simplicity of us versus them, the people vs. Big Brother.I’d like to hear 1984 written from the perspective of Big Brother. The dynamics of government, government control, and the temptation of power is what most interests me the most. I think it’s easy for us, mere individuals and lowly citizens on the bottom of the food chain, to abstract a single oppressive entity, the single “big brother” which has its own motivations and intentions acting as its own agent which oppresses us. But this misses out on a large portion of the truth. Any oppressive system (barring outright Monarchs) came about from a large complicated set of cause and effect which makes it difficult to point to any one person or party who is culpable. I’m sure all the reasons behind any given dictum or law, are extremely complex and this complexity has to render incomprehensible any abstracted notion of a singular entity with nefarious intentions behind it. (Hey Otis, am I still on topic, by the way?!?!)I’d like to hear that story because I think that no matter which perspective you take on any difficult, community-wide (society-wide) issue, it will be seen as “us versus them”; you’ll never get to the real source of what causes all these problems and issues no matter the perspective because you'll see it through the eyes of one person caught up in a society-wide issue (I think this was what Kafka was expressing through a lot of his work). I’d like to put this idea out there because certain fanaticism, while understandable, can get a little out of hand. This says nothing about the rights and wants of any one person or individual within the system, by the way. It says nothing about submitting to authority merely because the dynamics operating within that authority is complicated. I just feel that this is a piece of the puzzle that’s often left out of the conversation (and left out of this book!) What are big brother’s intentions? And how did these rules come about? What conditions brought about these decisions and dictums? What is it about a society that resulted in such oppressive and strict rules?I’d like to read that part of 1984. Maybe Orwell will write a sequel. ",Stephen M

It may have to to with the fact that I find politics boring (no offense to people who favor this book and/or politics). I don't understand it and have no real interest in it so I like to avoid the topic when it arises. That's just me. I just couldn't find one thing that I liked which is hard for me to admit because I try to find at least one thing, but it didn't happen. The wife of the main character (Katharine) is shown no mercy by her husband. The government only lets people marry f they share no attraction to one another. That was the only passion present will be for the society. So the main character Winston and Katharine are wed and are filed for separation after they can't produce a child. The whole point to child bearing is to have one more soldier for the government. Poor Katharine. All she wanted to do what she had to do, but couldn't. Winston shows no sympathy and doesn't even know if she's even alive before setting his sights on a much younger woman named Julia. Julia only rebels by satisfying her sexual desires. She has done this once she was 16 years old. Together Winston and Julia break the rules by ""loving each other"" which is against the law in this society. I don't like Julia at all, but I especially don't like that they plan to dwindle down the vocabulary to a point where there is little to no expression with words. Basically adjectives, adverbs, and even some verbs will no longer exist...and they're ok with this because it's what the government wants. The people find beauty in the destruction of words to which I was appalled when I read that part. I marvel at the beauty of words and this society wants to hinder it. As a booknerd/bibliophile, this pains me. Let me not influence you, dear audience. Feel what you wish on the this book. I wanted to like it because I've heard good things, but I couldn't.

1,619,1139,1138.0," I'm going to make this plain and clear. 1984 was probably the worst book I’ve ever read. Despite the writers purpose of showing the reader what a society controlled by socialism would be like i though he even did a bad job of that. For the first 3/4ths of the book the only thing that happens is a guy is wallowing in his own misery then there is a prostitute then he finds a lady friend, he says he loves her then they get caught, tortured, and end up hating each other. THE END I thought this book totally lacked a sufficient storyline, and any emotional connection. Reading it I felt no connection with either of the characters, and until they got taken hostage and tortured I didn’t care less whether they died or lived in constant hell. The only thing I could comment Orwell on was making the end so utterly horrible and grotesque that it made me both furious and hopeless at the same time.

But the book goes way beyond that to controlling the way we think and that you can't trust anyone and the inability to tell what is truth. YUCK!

I didn't feel anything for the characters, I honestly didn't care if they lived or died. It was painful to read. I was determined to finish it since it is such an important book, but I definitely didn't want to.

Towards the end of the book, O'Brien said how the totalitarian societies fell apart, and how the current society had learned from these mistakes. The only thing that changed was that the government pretended that everyone excluding the Inner Party was equal, except the Proles. This deceit enabled the government to get away with grossly mistreating its citizens and the never-ending destruction of evidence prevented people from realizing what was happening. The government in this book succeeded where Hitler failed- brainwashing the people.I struggled through parts of this book, especially when it was describing the society, because it seemed to repeat itself a lot and state the obvious.

2,5,5,,"I am asked on occasion why I dislike this, and some other similar classics, so much. I do not wish to offend anyone, yet I'm going be very, very blunt in my review. So please, if you liked the novel, don't feel obligated to read the rest of this. I have no qualm with the fact that others enjoyed it, and don't want to burst any bubbles with an unwarranted opinion.My review is entirely personal opinion, so I'm not going to make excuses or try to soften the blow. Please know I understand that what I give as absolute statements might be different for someone else. With that disclaimer, here are my two cents on these types of novels. My main issue with the book its theme. One example of how this is shown is that Winston is not a good person, yet he's the main character. And thus the theme: that evil is good and good is evil. I don't appreciate that.This message of ""evil is good and good is evil"" is like a hidden propaganda message, and is presented in every word of each page. By nature of the fact that I read and see that message, I have to absorb it to some degree. I really don't want that message in me, so with every moment I read, it's like I have to construct an iron barrier - a solid wall that shields by mind, heart, and soul from the wicked darts that with incredible force are being hurled and pounded against it. It's exhausting to have to fight with the text for up to hours on end like that. I'd rather conserve my strength and use it for something better in life than simply trying to keep shelter from the bombs of the enemy.When I read or think about these books, it drives away my happiness. Those around me notice that I am irritable, grumpy, and even downright angry after completing a reading assignment that comes from one of these texts. Looking back on that, I resent the fact that my freedom to choose is made narrow when these become an assignment for class. There are two options, as far as I can see: allow my inner peace to be stripped away for a time, or get a bad grade on the assignment. (I realize that I or my parents can also talk to the teacher and we could figure out an alternate solution, but there are only so many times that card can be used). I do not fault anyone for this - I realize that my teachers are bound by requirements, I do not blame those who make the requirements, nor do I blame society as a whole. No, I place no blame on anyone that the book was part of a class that I, after all, chose to take. However, I am free to dislike the book, and this was my reason why.",Bailey

Once he was finished it went back to being more interesting, but still never really caught my attention again. It was ok. Like I said.",Brianne Hepworth
2,11,11,,"After having read and seen the amount of love for this book I felt there was no way I would not enjoy it myself, but unfortunately it just wasn't my cup of tea. I feel like I was 64 years too late in reading this book. For the time period this book was published I understand how it broke a lot of barriers not just with its contents but how it shaped future dystopian books, it shocked its audiences and offered something new and different. But I feel like having read this book after the numerous dystopian books of today that are much darker and extreme, this was very unimpressive in comparison, due to no fault of its own but just having been read too late. I don’t think this book is really a ‘timeless’ classic in my opinion but a good example of early dystopian novels. Things I liked:- Some of the books concepts where thought-provoking and fascinating, I did enjoy at the start learning about the world and how its society lived and managed day-to-day life under the eye of ‘Big Brother’.- Julia was the only character I really liked in this book, the double life she lived of being the perfect Party member by day and a wild, sex crazy, rule breaker at night was interesting and I liked how she cared very little about the politics of the Party and didn’t over analyse or worry about everything like Winston did. - The snippets of childhood memories Winston shares in the book I found very touching and broke up the kind of repetitive nature of the book. Things I didn't like:- I found the main character very unlikeable and at no point did I feel like rooting for him. He was sadistic and very nonsensical. He was not as sly or discreet I felt as he thought he was. (Shown by the outcome of the book). He agrees to do much worse things than ‘Big Brother’ has ever done to him, plus he follows and trusts people he does not know blindly, so in short he was a bit of an idiot.- I didn't quite understand the author’s ideology of this world. I didn't completely understand the point of why things had to be the way they were or how it even got to that point, even after the author numerously tries to explain it throughout the book. I think all the dialogue and long descriptions of explanation just came across as mad rambles of text that did a good job of relating the passion behind the subject of Big Brother, The Party etc. But made little sense and it was easy to get lost and not be able to follow any thought process of the main/other characters. - For example ‘The Hunger Games’ is a dark and extreme dystopian world, but as a reader I understand why that society lives that way and how it got to be that way, which sort of justifies certain things in the book, with this book I just couldn't fully grasp the reasoning behind everything. - After the halfway point of this book it becomes less book, more essay. I didn't think I was going to be able to finish the book once Winston start reading ""that book"" (that as readers we are reading along with him) the writing style changed in to one of an essays and to be honest not a word of it processed or went in as it was super confusing and to put it bluntly, boring.I wouldn't say it put me off George Orwell as an author I still massively want to read ‘Animal Farm’ as it that sounds to me to have a very original plot, definitely something I have not read before.",Casey

2,18,18,,"I am not enjoying the book as much as I would have liked. I am finding that I am flipping through the book too quickly and it's not because I am on a marathon. the book wasn't written as well as Animal Farm. Animal Farm is truly a captivating novel, a quality this book lacks in my opinion. I am also finding that this book can be compared to A Handmaid's Tail by Atwood. If you have a thorough knowledge of current events, and an understanding of how totalitarian regimes operate, then this book will probably not keep you reading attentively. As I read this book, I am thinking of the events that are occurring in the Middle East, regimes in Africa, China, Russia and all regimes which have tried to control the masses by force, by creating and giving institutions names which correspond to a hidden agenda, changing the language of the masses, allowing the masses to grow weary and dumber by the minute, distracting them of the actualities of daily social and political life.

Then the end just made me angry when the two characters just went their separate ways. That didn't seem right to me, but in many books today, love can withstand anything. Maybe this book was being realistic. That even torture can break a person love for another. I do find it hilarious that this was on the banned books list, most likely because it was saying the government is behind everything and that it is never for the better. CONSPIRACY! The idea that George Orwell actually made people never want their children to read this book, because they may get ""idea's"" is ludicrous. It was a good book. Just kind of slow.",Alison Olsen

The beginning of the book was incredibly monotonous and lame.

2,50,50,,"I can see why it is so popular. It was written right after WW2, by an intelligent Englishman who experienced Stalinist Russia. The themes it deals with would have greatly appealed to the Western frame of mind at that time and the fact that it was put into novel form instead of a magazine article, has greatly contributed to its popularity, I think.That said, it is not for me. I have no interest in politics and only a little in history.What I liked:1. The idea. I am a sucker for dystopian worlds and this one was realistic (well, mostly).2. The philosophy. I did not mind the parts Winston read from The Book, it was interesting.3. Before I knew of G.O.'s history, I was reminded heavily of Russia during Stalin's time. (The same with Animal Farm. That's how poignant the writing was.) I was also reminded of Equilibrium. I wonder if it was influenced by this...What I disliked:1. Waaaay too depressing. No silver linings or happy endings here. Just goes from bad to worse really. (view spoiler)[ I was hoping in the end that something would have triggered a memory of his mother, that it would have helped him to keep up his rebellion. Maybe he had suppressed a traumatic memory of his mother and sister being shot in front of him and the memory of it, there in the pub at the end, would have created a new glimmer of rebellion. The early memory would have been out of O'Brien's reach, since O'Brien was more concerned with Winston's recent history, the last 7 years. I would have accepted THAT speck of rebellion, as little as it is, as a happy ending. The real ending sucked.  (hide spoiler)]2. There was not enough there for the ""novel"". Not much plot, not much characterization, the romance sucked, there were no twists and turns. Everything is straightforward.3. I found some of the ideas ridiculous. All that effort expended to torture people (view spoiler)[ for the sake of power. Laughable.  (hide spoiler)] All the effort expended to indoctrinate people, brainwash, the history revisions - all that just seems like too much effort for very little pay-off. Also, it is VERY unlikely that if the world split off like that (which it might well do), I say, it would be very unlikely that the political systems that might arise from such a split would be identical. And how can 2 countries not defeat 1? And what happens when Eurasia and Eastasia ally themselves against Oceania, hmm?So while some of the ideas were awesome, some ideas fell flat to my mind. The author was very intelligent and I struggled to keep up, so I'm sure he probably had acceptable answers to my objections, but perhaps he did not have enough time and space to fit it into the book.It would have been so much better with more plot.

It also really freaks me out that a an author would write about a book like this. I always wonder why the author even came up with an idea of living in a totalitarian government.

2,103,103,," 1984, is a somewhat chilling story of the government that always watches you by George Orwell.

In his efforts to break the rules he finds a girl named Julia and they fall in love as she shows him where to get illegal products like wine and real coffee instead of gin and Victory coffee. When they eventually get caught they find out what Big Brother can actually do to punish them and the real purpose of the punishment. I found this book not one of my favorites compared to some other books I have read in the past even though I still understand that it is a classic book from 1946. I would think this book would fit my likings a bit more if it used modern day speech.

Big Brother monitors every move and thought of each civilian. As Winston pays attention to past events, he notices some flaws about the system in which everyone else thinks is normal. He decides that he hates Big Brother. While reading this book, it was very very hard to get into. I didn't like it for several reasons. The beginning was a bit boring and too descriptive. I did however like that it was different from other dystopian books that I have read. ",Josefina Fernandez

2,112,112,,"The book 1984 does not suit me. I think the content in the book is very good, but it is written in a way that makes the book boring. it does not happen so much important things and the beginning is very slow before it happen something. The book have strange word that you don´t understand and there are lengthy explanations that made me understand even less. I think the end of the book is the best, because it happened so much and it was very exciting. The book would be better if the whole book was more like the end. The book was hard to read, you have to be very focused to understand what you are reading. Sometimes I have to read a page over and over again to remember what I have read and understand it. I think the books storylines is important and appropriate to today´s society. Now days is it so much of technology and you can not be sure if someone is watching you. It could be homepage on the internet who can maybe get hold of your photos or other privet things. The book made me think more about that kind of stuff and it also made me think about if there are any cameras in the room. It´s a little bit scary that George Orwell thought that the world would be like that, who know? Maybe it will.",Rebecka Forsberg
2,114,114,,"I actually think it’s a very boring book, because nothing happens. It’s also told really dull. After all, I don’t think I’ll choose this book again for another odd reading exercise. It’s of course really smart to write a book of 326 pages (that’s how many page my book has) about a time in the far future. What for George 1984 was, is for me if I begin now 2049. I don’t think I could write a book like this. It also hasn’t any sense of humour, I haven’t seen a joke yet, and I like books with lots of jokes in it. That’s one of the reasons why it wasn’t a good choice to choose this book. But there are some points why I liked this book, namely the action there sometimes was, for example the chaos while the Two Minutes Hate. In short, I didn’t like this book very much. 1984 George Orwell",Lucas

2,122,122,," George Orwell’s famous and historic novel, 1984 paints a dystopian view of the future where the government has overtaken and gained control of all aspects of everyday life. The novel follows Winston Smith, an intellectual who opposes the tyrannical rule of the Party and its leader Big Brother. Winston falls in love and begins an illegal sexual relationship with a woman named Julia. They are eventually discovered and tortured until they learn to accept the Party as an absolute power. The novel ends with Winston’s sense of self being broken, he now sincerely loves the Party and remarks that he has, “won the victory over himself.” While I enjoyed the novel I felt the overall message and setting were the real stand out aspects. Orwell creates a bleak world that is just on the line of fantasy while still sounding plausible. The themes are also thought provoking and engaging. I felt like the characters were the only part of the novel that lacked detail and could have used some elaboration. ",Daniel Kanhai

Winston Smith is a normal person who lives in Oceania London and works in the monastery a truth. The monastery of truth rights and rewrites history according to the Party’s standards. When Winston rewrites history he begins to wonder what to the true version of history is. When the thought of defeating the party possible began to make Winston think if the “paroles” (persons that are not in the party) since paroles make up 85% of the population of you could get the paroles to fight the party they might have a chance. Through the book Winston meets Julia who has the same thoughts as Winston about the party. Unfortunately for both of them they put their trust into O’Brian who in the end is gets both of them locked up in room 101and mentally and physically breaks them down so they believe everything that the party wants everyone to believe.

This book was no exception to my general hatred of school reading. Sometimes it was physically painful to read. Now you're probably wondering ""if you hated it so much why did you give it two stars instead of one?"" Well dear hypothetical questioner, because as much as I hated the book I can't admit to it not making me think about the world around me. Which I'm pretty sure was the intent of both Orwell and my soon to be Lang teacher. Well played well played -_- *grumble grumble* This book was really creepy to me, mostly because I could actually see the similarities to Oceania and current day America that everyone was trying to get me excited about in the reviews under the front cover of my copy. If your looking for a fun-feel-good book look somewhere else. Now if you'll excuse me I'm off to write and essay about the book, to be turned in with my annotated copy of the book.

Winston Smith was a pretty flat main character. That is something that I would be able to overlook because of the environment he lives in, but what really made the story a little boring was the fact that at some point Winston gets a book about the totalitarion regime he lives under and many chapters of 1984 consist of chapters from that book. If it had given me any new insights into how the system worked it could have been interesting, but it didn't tell me anything new.

Also, I agree that limiting the imagination of people and narrowing their horizons of thought is the best way to control them. The hypothesis is convincing, but it is impossible in practise.The way that Winston broke and betrayed was realistic and most people would, like him, succumb. But I believe that there are humans out there whose resilient spirit would resist until the very end.Of course Orwell provided one alternative to the fanatic Socialist regime that ruled Oceania, which is a Capitalist regime, but more options could have been explored.Orwell proposed that only a Revolution could bring the Party down, and I wholeheartedly disagree.I don't like Revolutions...Never have...Never will :)Also, I don't feel any temptation to read for Orwell again.

Also I don't really like such political books like 1984 it really zoned in on the type of law they had and how it was a totalitarian state , it focused on Winstons need for rebellion and control of thoughts. I am more of a mystery and horror type of person when it comes to books. I did like that it had a sense of mystery tho with room 101, the secrecy officers such as O'Brien, and the diary.

2,241,241,,"I'm probably going to be hated on for this, but I really did not enjoy this novel.1984 is classified as a fiction novel and as far as novels go this was bad. While the plot must have been very interesting back in 1949, the characters fell flat, the writing was extremely boring and the book as a whole felt like a political essay. Whole chapters were dedicated to writing down the teachings of Goldstein, which was pretty much Orwell's musings on politics. One cannot deny that this book is timeless, it brought us Big Brother (for those of you who don't know what that is, it's an unfortunate reality television series) and most of today's dystopians are clearly heavily influenced by 1984 (The Handmaid's Tale, The Hunger Games) but it should have been placed in the politics section, not fiction. Orwell can't do fiction. I'm sorry, but he can't. He's too focused on delivering his message to the world to bother with fictional elements (world building, character progression, etc.)I would give this book a 5 star rating for the theories it presented and the possibilities it lays out. As a novel it will only get 2 because ultimately it bored me to tears and felt like an obligation that I had to get done with. I'm done with classics. They are clearly not my thing. If it means I can't discuss books with the ""intellectuals"" anymore, I can live with that. ",Lilyan

2,248,248,,"In the classic novel, 1984; a young man by the name of Winston Smith lives in a dystopian society after the atomic bomb during World War II. In this society there is a ""Party"" (group of high class people) that control the human race in a small area called Oceania. Now with this Party they wanted to create a new language called Newspeak. Now Newspeak is a language that would and will prevent the citizen of Oceania to stop talking/speaking of political rebellion. Later on in this story, Winston Smith meets a coworker that he admires. He doesn't speak to her, but he does look at her once in a while to grab her attention. The next day Winston recieves a letter from the lady saying that she loves him and sends him her name, Julia. After a while the two begin to have a serious relationship, which doesn't last very long because the Party wants to prevent from happening. Towards the end of the novel, Winston goes to jail, but he is soon released out, but he has no more feelings for Julia anymore. At the end of the novel, he begins to have feelings for Big Brother and the Party.Personally, I didn't enjoy this novel because it seemed like a furturistic novel because it was about a group of people controlling the world. At first I thought this book would be very enjoyable and very different when it said it was a dystopian novel. Also, something that kind of disappointed me in this novel was that when I was reading it, it didn't feel like it was a classic book. Now what I mean by this that a classic book should be from a long time about and it should have references about past events. But in this book the auther didn't talk about past events, it didn't explain what happened to the world and how it began to become a different society. I would not personally recommend this book to anyone, unless you just want to pass some time.",Samir

I actually felt relieved when I finished it today. This was another modern classic that I somehow missed in high school and college. However, I probably would have never made myself finished it back then like I did now. I don't recommend this book. Other books have the same message and they are much more fun to read.

(I had nightmares three times before learning my lesson)Am I the only person who did not enjoy this book?Okay, I have to say that Orwell has a pretty amazing plot right here, that he didn't know how to portrait the characters around it is another story. This is a story that regardless of its age, it can relate (in many ways) to our society, foreign policies and the way we are handled by the higher authorities. It was a struggle to read this book as it is very confusing because of thoughtcrime: what can be white, is white but you need to know inside you that white could also be black, which at the end means that white is black. BUT if thought otherwise, that black is white, then you can be taken by the Party and torture until you die. YEAH. Basically, confusing. I dont recommend this book. Seriously, i don't. It is a really good story, and though I feel everyone should know about it, don't read it, just ask someone to summarize it for you, instead of dragging yourself through its lame characters and confusing Party policies.PS: If you are into languages, you might want to read everything on newspeak.

I was already told that I missed the point and how much like this imaginary world our world is now and isn't it scary blah blah. Yes lots of things are somewhat similar, and that's all the more reason that I hated the ending. It's basically just saying 'this world is crap and no matter what you can't change it'.

2,277,277,,"I have to admit, I hated this book. 100% completely hated it. Maybe it was because of the non relatable characters, the boring plot, or how depressing the book was. (Or maybe it was all of those together.)The only good thing in the entire book was the idea of writing about the future. That is the only reason why I rated it two stars instead of one.When I heard about the whole concept I was actually kinda excited to read the book. I envisioned some cool high tec society that people back in the 1940s dreamed about. But when I started it soon became clear that this book was nothing like that at all. The only high tec stuff was these telescreens that blared propaganda for a horrible society and couldn't be turned off. Not to mention that they were watching your every move and if you did something wrong in front of them you would be severely punished. Orwell must have had a really dark mind if this is what he thought the future was going to be like...But what really ruined it was until about page 200 all the main character did was complain. There was nothing going on except for him ranting and some awkward love scenes. And the part where he reads The Book? It took me 3 days to read 15 pages. That's how boring it is (and how exciting my other books were). Oh, and don't even get me started on the ending. Ick. It was so bad it was almost gross. Except for the fact that I was done with the awful book... I may or may not have celebrated with an excessive amount of cookies... :DSo overall, don't read it.

2,282,282,,"1984 by George Orwell is certainly a book that should not be missed, but I must say I was overall disappointed.There are quite a few things I take issue with, but I will keep things vague for the sake of not spoiling anything.The first being that I did not relate to the protagonist save for a few moments in the book (at the end I felt deeply for him, but by the last 4 pages he had completely lost my sympathy.)Second, the book leaves you with absolutely no satisfaction whatsoever, throughout the entire story you see events unfolding to create a grand climax of events, and then it is suddenly cut short, corrupted, and ruined.Now being that 1984 is a distopian story, it should be understood that it will be a bleak story. This does not mean one should expect a story where humanity itself is turned on its head, the book flights human nature and society in ways I took great issue with.All in all 1984 is a story that should not be missed but in my opinion is not worth returning too.

2,307,307,,"""1984"" is science fiction movie that is most appropriate for high school age and older. It has won a few literary awards such as Prometheus Hall of Fame Award (1984), Locus Award Nominee for All-Time Best Science Fiction Novel (1987). The setting is a dystopia and follows the character Winston as he pursues things and does things that are forbidden, like individuality and relationships. It was written as a look into the future and what life would be like, which in the book is painted as gloomy and miserable. I remember being required to read this in high school and remember how boring it was for me. I think the idea of it is good, that socialism and the lost of privacy can cause humanity to be ruined.

Now I understand that George Orwell probably did this intentionally, but for me personally, I can't stand it!

2,319,319,,"1984 isn't the usual sort of book I would pick up, you only have to see my Goodreads page or my blog to know that. I usually stick pretty solidly with young adult books, but I've always been curious about cult classic like Fight Club and A Clockwork Orange, both of which have movies I love. I thought 1984 would be a good choice for me because I love the Dystopia genre but sadly, I was wrong.I spent a lot of time hating reading this book, but I was determined to finish it, just to say that I had read it. I found a lot of problems. The first was the characters. Winston himself and most of the other characters are just... cardboard. There's nothing really there. Easily forgettable, and I never cared very much for Winston or whether he would survive the book.Another problem was well, the whole concept. I did have a little difficulty swallowing the idea that in about 20 years, the entire world had changed so much as to divide into 3 super states, or whatever they were called. It just seemed too far fetched that anyone could take over that quickly, and have the entire population under their thumb that quickly too.I was expecting that introduction of Julie to really speed up the story, and it did a little. Guess what, I had a serious problem with Julie too. You may have heard this term attributed to John Green's girls, but Julie really was a Manic Pixie Dream Girl. She had no real personality and I had no idea why this young girl loved Winston, a guy in (or nearing?) his forties.Julie did start off Winston questioning the system, breaking the rules and starting to do something, as per her MPDG requirements... even if breaking the rules was so they could have somewhere quiet to have sex. A lot. Thankfully, Julie magically never got pregnant, because if she did there would sure be a lot of questioning going on.About three quarters into the story we come across what can only be described as a text book by me, and wonderful by Julie. We're 'treated' to this text book for freaking thirty pages without a break inbetween, which has a lot of details about the war, without me actually understanding how these powers took over so quickly. I nearly fell asleep on numerous occasions.The ending was okay. It was certainly stronger than the rest of the book and it wasn't the ending I was fully expecting, which was a nice surprise. Honestly, I was just glad to finish it finally, it took me about 6 days in total, rather than my usual 1-2. I don't think I'll be picking this book up again.",Vickie Wilson

Can you imagine being restrained from having yoiur own thoughts, opinions, or even an uncontrolled life? They were all ruled by a leader, Big Brother, who would watch anything and everything you do. Telescreens were used almost like giant videocameras, the size of a full-length wall with the party watching you 24/7. Even in your sleep, the Thought Police can track your facial movements and expressions and if you make one wron expression, they can tell exactly what you're thinking.I did not like this book.

2,334,334,,"Scores some points for merit, I suppose. But what lacklustre characters, what a lame plot, what an implausible, because utterly unsustainable, set-up! A regime that kills/imprisons people faster than they can be bred requires more suspension of disbelief than this reader is willing to give. And how exactly are they staffing the 24/7 surveillance of everybody? And how are they keeping track of their constant rewriting of history – and they don’t even have computers? Microphones all over the countryside everywhere? Has Orwell ever seen pictures of the countryside in, say, North America or Siberia? Goes to show that dystopias are easy to imagine, but hard to make convincing. Could he not just have written an essay? Why bother with a novel? Wait, that was the same question I had about Animal Farm...ETA:It looks as if anyone who is less than enthusiastic about this book get upbraided for not understanding it or not realising how important and eminently applicable it is. So let me clarify: I get why it is an important book. I award Orwell merit points for the warning he gives. I see where it is applicable. That’s not my point. It is the execution of the book that sucks. I shall explain this in detail:1.	CharactersCharacters are the heart and soul of a story. You can have an engaging story with not a lot of plot if the characters are fascinating; but no matter how great your plot, it will fall flat if your characters are rubbish. 1984 has rubbish characters. First there is Winston. I think the word that best describes him is “pathetic” and I believe few would argue with that. He has no positive qualities, not a lot of negative qualities either, he has almost no qualities at all. Now it can be argued that Orwell was showing us that this kind of society would produce this kind of pathetic character, and that’s a fair point. But why would I, as a non-masochistic reader, wish to spend 300 pages in the intimate company of a pathetic, hopeless wretch? Secondly, there is Julia. She is the woman for whom timid, cautious, paranoid Winston risks his life, so she will have to be quite something, she’ll have to be intriguing, right? Well, she’s young and pretty. She has some kind of pragmatic cunning that enables her to dodge Party demands. And she’s not interested in anything much, apart from sex. She likes sex. That’s it. I am profoundly unintrigued. The other characters are even less engaging.2.	PlotOh, and don’t we wish it were a great plot. But no. The plot is dull, linear and totally predictable. Winston reveals to us at the beginning that one mustn’t dare anything lest one gets caught. Then he dares something. He gets caught. He gets tortured. He breaks down. That’s the whole plot. It is also predictable in detail, for example it is blatantly obvious that the Brotherhood is a Party ruse. It’s obvious that the room above the antiques shop will be monitored and that they’ll get caught there. It’s obvious that Winston will eventually go to room 101 and that he will “betray” Julia there. And it is annoying to read a story where you can already tell where it is going and then it drags on and on without much point and you think, “Just arrest him already!” Besides, the plot holes. How does Julia not get pregnant, don’t tell me she has access to contraceptives? How can she know the countryside hide-out so well after a single trip and how does she know there are no microphones there? How come Winston doesn’t ask himself what the point is of O’Brian switching off the telescreen, since this would surely signal to the Party that something underhand was going on? 3.	Literary techniquesAnd why do the symbols have to be so blooming obvious as well? The PAPERWEIGHT!!!!! It gets BROKEN!!!!! I felt that Orwell marched Winston and Julia out into the countryside for the sole purpose of making them hear that wee burdie sing. It represents FREEDOM!!!!!! And just in case the reader missed that, Orwell shoves in some dialogue between Winston and Julia where they kindly explain it to the readers. And what’s with the nursery rhymes? Did Orwell read too many Miss Marple books?4.	Setting/world-buildingThis is the novel’s greatest failing. Now, I am quite willing to let the Enterprise travel at Warp speed, because that’s just Star Trek, and I am happy to allow that Elves are immortal and have super powers, because after all, Tolkien invented them, so it’s up to him. But this book is supposed to be serious and contain a real political warning, so it will have to stand up to a reality check. Especially since the setting is really the main point, one might say the only point of the book. Throughout history, human experience has been a mixed bunch, so when someone comes along and says “Everything is wonderful,” or “Everything is awful,” then one needs to check very closely. Well, I have checked and with the best will in the world I cannot muster the suspension of disbelief this setting would require. My main gripe is this: The concept of total control over everything and everyone is not plausible because when considered realistically, it is way, way, way too much effort. It is unsustainable. One just needs to do the maths:2% of the population are Inner Party, 15% Outer Party, 84% Proles. For Airstrip 1, let’s assume a total population of 40 million – I am being generous here, it is probably lower, what with the nuclear war and the ongoing bombardment and all the executions, but I will err in favour of Orwell in all the calculations here. So that gives us 800 000 Inner Party, 6 million Outer Party and just over 33 million Proles. The Proles are supposedly not as strictly supervised, though Orwell says the Party will exterminate anyone who shows signs of intelligence, so that requires a fair amount of monitoring, but we’ll neglect this here and only consider the monitoring of the 6 million. See how generous I am? Assume that of the 800 000 Inner Party members, 75% are of working age, giving us 600 000. All Outer Party members, regardless of age, will need to be supervised. These 6 million are surrounded 24/7 by the reciprocal telescreens, in their homes, at work, in their leisure hours and everywhere in public. Make that 10 million telescreens broadcasting 24/7. Therefore they need to be monitored 24/7. How many screens could one person monitor simultaneously? I will be extremely generous and say 50. So that means there are 200 000 lots of 50 screens to be monitored. Assuming 12 hour shifts and no days off, ever, it will take 400 000 Inner Party members to monitor the screens. The remaining 200 000 have a large number of other jobs to do, for example organising and executing long-term elaborate tortures for hordes of Outer Party members (almost everyone Winston knows gets caught in the course of the book) and producing the brainwashing propaganda. Also, every day without fail, they have to scan every single movie, photograph or print document in the country, take notes of the parts that need to be amended, give instructions to people like Winston, then evaluate the work of people like Winston (we hear that there are always several amendments submitted), choose an amendment, finalise it, organise the reprinting of the amended document and then hunt down, replace and destroy every single copy of that document in existence. How they do that in practice is a mystery to me. Do they have special burglar forces that break into people’s homes on a daily basis? It is a superhuman task, done without computers, and it only ever gets larger and larger. But still, the Inner Party also needs to have enough people available to monitor all the microphones that cover the countryside! How many, do you think? The island of Great Britain has a surface area of 229,848 km2. Generously assume that you will need no more than a hundred microphones per square kilometre (that would mean microphones spaced at hundred meter intervals, and they’d have to be jolly good microphones.) So, we come to a staggering grand total of nearly 23 000 000 microphones. How many could one person listen to simultaneously? They’ll have a lot of noise on them, from the weather and wildlife, so I would say 20 at the utmost. Meaning 1 150 000 batches of 20, requiring 2 300 000 people to monitor them in 12 hour shifts with no days off, ever. But you have less than 200 000 people for the job. And this is in a densely populated country. Imagine how this would work out for, say Canada with nearly 10 million square kilometres, requiring one billion microphones! 50 million people needed to monitor them! And consider the billions of miles of cables, and the maintenance, and how dead easy it would be for any mildly geeky rebel to disable a few of them.I hear the defenders of Orwell say that they don’t really need the microphones, they just need to make people think they are there. True, a lot of people would believe that. But not all. There are enough smartie-pants about who’d suss this out very quickly and use it to their advantage. They’d have plenty of motivation, to be sure. And there we have it: You cannot squash all rebellion by constantly monitoring everything, everywhere. It is mathematically impossible, given the size of the planet. Even with very sophisticated technology, which Oceania doesn’t have, you would still need enormous numbers of staff to evaluate the data. Case in point: We have much better technology than Oceania, and yet struggle to keep a tab on criminal activity on the internet. And need I mention 9/11? Superior technology and authoritarian organisation are no defence against guerrilla tactics. Rebellion is not only possible, it is almost guaranteed.The 600 000 working age Inner Party members stand no chance whatsoever to scrutinise the movements, words and thoughts of 6 million people 24/7, let alone of the 33 million proles. Every single member of the Inner Party would have to have absolute, gapless knowledge of the minds of ten Outer Party members and fairly comprehensive knowledge of over fifty proles. Their lives would really have to contain the lives of sixty other people – how would that be possible? And even if they could, what for? What good does it do them to be top dogs if it means they have to spend all waking hours of every day of their lives doing a tedious and soul-destroying task? And I haven’t even touched on the question of how they monitor EACH OTHER. Neither have I touched on the question how, in that totally dilapidated economic disaster area where random bombs fall frequently, they keep their surveillance equipment going even half of the time.The other massive flaw, apart from the impossibility of total surveillance, is that Orwell takes it for granted that hundreds of millions, if not billions of people in Africa, India and South-East Asia will forever uncomplainingly accept their fate as exploited slave labourers, resigned to the power of their ever-changing masters. Yes, the tiny, overworked Inner Party minority has still resources left to oppress them as well! Perhaps Orwell was blinded by some white supremacy thinking, I don’t know, but it simply doesn’t cut the mustard.The world-building is shoddy in other ways as well. For example, Orwell goes to great lengths to explain the concept of Newspeak, but then no character, not even the most enthusiastic Party member, not even the guy who works on the new dictionary, ever uses it. It only appears on the instructions Winston gets at work. So what’s the point? But I could set that aside, because it is not a central issue. The other issue, though, is crucial, because the total surveillance and mind-control are the core concept of the book. And I cannot suspend my disbelief on that, not for one minute. Besides, any regime that kills and imprisons people faster than they can be bred will run out of people very soon. You see, Mr Orwell, turning every knob on the totalitarianism amplifier up to 11 just won’t work.",Virtuella

2,345,345,,"This novel helped me discover/realize something about myself: I really have no interest in politics whatsoever. I'm not even talking about today's American current event politics with campaigning and conservatives and old white guys. I have a few hot button issues I care about (education, contraception) and the rest I don't care about. But 1984 has nothing to do about that. It focuses on a bigger picture with talking heads, you vs. me, economics, and big vs. small government. And I really just don't care.Politics seems petty to me. It reminds me of Einstein's quote: ""Do not worry about your problems with mathematics, I assure you mine are far greater."" Meaning that the scope of how laws are made, what they affect, and budget/economic restraints are so far beyond my comprehension and power that they hover into the realm of magic. But you didn't come here to hear about politics, you came to hear about the book.I guess the problem is that all the great elements of this book have been stripped out, snipped & groomed, and applied into other creative works. This book reads like a catalog of ideas that were used in ""The Matrix"", ""Lord of the Flies"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Dark City"", even ""Alien"". I bet anyone watching the reality show ""Big Brother"" (Is that still on?) has no idea where the term came from. So there's nothing in the book that's new or hasn't been improved on. It's full of ideas, but weak on story. There's a whole chapter that's mostly an excerpt from the anti-government manifesto the rebels are reading. It's pages and pages of political discourse, but little characterization and little plot.It's like the difference between movies and films. Movies have to have a plot. Films are just art with a message. 1984 feels like art. It's trying to shove a message and sacrifices plot & characters to do that. Why else would there be pages and pages dedicated to speeches?",Eric Juneau

2,355,355,,"My book, 1984, I feel, is a metaphor for society, and how it can be so corrupted. The main character, Winston, is a boring, working, corporate, nobody who works for the ministry in a controlling country called ""Oceania"". He is completely floating around in his own little world. When he falls in love with a lady,Julia, I think it was just spur of the moment, and that it was because he needed someone or something to get caught up in. He needed an escape from the drawl of it all. I think the lady chose the forest to hook up in because she, narrow minded and all, thought you wouldn't be able to hang a microphone on a thin tree. This shows how ignorant people can get. The government,or BIG BROTHER, uses this to its advantage, exploiting the citizens of Oceania.Another example, is when they decide to do it in the room above the antique place. They just thought the old man was some crazy bat.He later turned out to be a thought cop, meaning he could turn them in for the crime of sex. It's like when graffiti writers go out bombing,and they see a hobo, and they think, ""That's a hobo, whats he gonna do?"", and the hobo turns out to be a vandal squad officer undercover, and they get arrested, it's because the police decide to take advantage of the unsuspecting criminal, who didn't know the drunk on the corner was also a cop. Winston and Julia thought that the one fling in the forest was unnoticed, and so they thought it was all good to keep going, but the government and cops were just waiting for more knowledge to get them with.The telescreens are an example of complete want of power. They can here what you are saying, so lets say you say something incriminating, the thought police would be at your door in no time. They want to know what you think, say, like, and do. They want to control everyone to the extent of they cant be questioned without being vaporized. I think going deeper, that it's like they don't want to have people in the world to screw up their plans, so they have none questioning their cruel, unfair, government. People in the book are too stupid to realize that the government is taking their blindness as a positive. Winston attempts to be the exact person big brother likes to get rid of, so Orwell is trying to explain 1 person can start a revolution. You can tell a government really wants to be watching you when it's slogan is ""Big Brother is watching you!""I think the official overview of the book is that Orwell predicts that in the future, the government's going to take advantage of people's ignorance, and there is going to be such corruption, that people wont be aloud to do anything. The government's going to want to suck the power from people and take it their selves. When Orwell wrote this book, I think he didn't think it would get this extreme, but he wanted to send a message. A message that you shouldn't let the government take advantage of your beliefs, and that with great power, comes mental dysfunction. Big Brother is a symbol of what our world is becoming and George Orwell wanted people to be shocked into stopping the process.",Jesse705

2,360,360,,"I can see why this was a classic back in the 60s and 70s. Orwell provides an incredibly in-depth view of the problems and dangers of socialism and communism. However, the book gets a little long. The story of Winston does a great job of showing you how life sucks inside The Party, but then Orwell proceeds to read to you the book inside the book explaining the problems--which you already know from the narrative. Getting rid of the chapters where Winston reads the book would have been fine, even Winston says at the end that the book didn't tell him he didn't already know. Also, if you want a book with a happy ending, this is not it. In true ""classic"" style, it tells things truthfully and does not in any way embellish the ending to be some rosy outcome that makes you smile. The protagonist does not win out, and there is no indication by the end of the book that things will ever change. Remember, it isn't a narrative about the conquest over socialism, it is a narrative of the potential conquest OF socialism.",Fowie

2,363,363,,"Nineteen Eighty-four by George Orwell, shows a very interesting side of where the world could possibly go. This book is written in a time which is believed to be the year 1984. The region Winston Smith lives in is a very authoritarian area. There are many kind of police that monitor everything to make sure they are all controlled. According to the book, nothing mattered, ""only the thought police mattered."" (Orwell 2) These ""thought police"" watched people to see if any of their actions or emotions showed a plan of secrecy or rebellion. There is also a large amount of propaganda. There are advertisements of ""Big Brother"" (the head leader) all over the country trying to keep people voting for him. (Orwell 47) The idea of this government is to do what they want and hope people will not question it. Orwell wrote this book really well but I feel it is not very entertaining. There is much confusion throughout the book and it is hard to read. I think this book is still good but it is extremely interesting. The most confusing part of this book is that Winston worked the entire book to escape the ideology of the government and then it turns out that ""he loved Big Brother.""

Everything was extremely controlled (a stifled and strangulated environment).

2,375,375,,"Let me start by saying this: I completely understand why this book was a game-changer, why it inspired an entire genre, and why people still talk about its relevancy. In fact, I thought the ideas alone warranted five stars - how creative of a person must George Orwell have been to come up with such a chilling portrayal of not only the future, but also of the lengths to which humans will go for power, pain, and ambition. However, what 1984 had in ideas, it lost in execution. The three-hundred plus pages seemed to drag on, full of metaphysical ramblings with no real movement of plot. When the plot did move, it was often as a sort of side note - here are thirteen pages of Winston's thoughts, and, oh yeah, he met a girl. In each part of the book, Orwell could easily have slimmed down by half or even a third of the text. For example, the reader doesn't really need seventeen pages of Goldstein's transcribed book; as Winston says when he stops reading, it tells him nothing that he didn't already know. The primary purpose of this portion is to let the reader know (view spoiler)[ that the craziness of Oceania and its society is actually global in nature  (hide spoiler)] all of which could be summarized in a paragraph or two - or even that number of pages. So the stars are for the ideas, (view spoiler)[ and for the torture - now there's a part that Orwell skimped on  (hide spoiler)] but the two stare rating perfectly embodies my opinion on the book; it was okay. Certainly every person should read it, and yes, it was very good ideologically, but Orwell failed to preform as a writer, preferring instead the dry, stilted role of a man that badly wanted to be an essayist instead of a novel-writer, but felt that 1984 could not exist in the form he wished.

I needed the plot to help me get through and the chapters were all blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I couldn't wait to finish. I thought about quiting, I read quickly.Orwell's anticipation of the horrors of socialism (and it's full blown child, totalitarianism) proves to be close to the actual situation in some countries, particularly those of the communist genre. The fact that the book was published in 1949 is remarkable even if his apocalyptic vision of world domination by single government of this type did not materialize (and I'm thanking God for that!).However, to read so much about what the world may be like (oh no!) in 1984, knowing full well what it IS like in 2008 is deflating, and a good indication of why futurists are much like weather forecasters - everyone is interested in what they have to say, but a high standard of accuracy is not required for success.I wanted to read this book to contrast it with ""Brave New World"" which I liked the more I think about 1984! In the end, I have concluded they are both right and wrong. I agree with Huxley that pleasure is a far more captivating master, but I think his flaw is the overestimation of humankind's ability to create a situation so ideal, even if driven by the strongest evil motives for control. Orwell's dark, totalitarian IngSoc has much more probability in real life, and is closer to the dark regimes of our day. However, he underestimates the human wiring for religious worship experience, and he overemphasizes socialism/ totalitarianism's ability to dominate our world. In the end, it will not be any one system of government that will bring humanity down (as awful an idea as communism, Nazism, totalitarianism are), but our own sinful natures that long for right living but are completely unable to attain it without the intervention of the Almighty - in other words, if it's not one government model, it will be another.

Es que...Winston no tiene mucha personalidad. De hecho si hoy alguien me pregunta cómo es Winston, me le quedo mirando con esta cara:En serio, no sabría qué decir. ¿Winston es bueno? ¿Es malo? ¿Es cruel? ¿Es lujurioso? ¿Es de moral indefinible (como a mis amigas del Emma's Tea Party les gusta decir)? ¿Es rebelde? ¿Es inteligente por darse cuenta de algunas cosas? ¿Es tonto por caer en otras? No lo sé. No me queda claro. Me parecía que Winston se adaptaba a la situación, su personalidad variaba dependiendo de lo que sucedía y cómo repercutía en él...No noté un nudo consistente. De hecho parece que lo más importante durante dos tercios de libro fue Julia. Julia esto, Julia lo otro, su cuerpo, su juventud, su cabello, su forma de hablar, Julia, Julia, Julia. Pero Julia no le trajo ninguna noción nueva al libro, simplemente ella era la demostración de cómo vivían ellos sometidos en ese gobierno comunista (oh, vamos, el ""camarada"" se usa en los gobiernos comunistas, no me digan que no. Si escuchan a alguien llamarlos ""camarada"" corran hacia el bloque capitalista más cercano). Durante gran parte del libro (y eso que es corto) no sucedía nada. Eran explicaciones y más explicaciones. Y más explicaciones todavía, por si no quedaba claro. Mi cabeza estaba a la expectativa de que algo pasara, pero los capítulos se sucedían sin nada interesante...Me parece que el libro intenta demasiado dejarnos un mensaje. En su momento este libro debió ser toda una novedad, todo un grito crítico hacia el bloque comunista que se estaba alzando en el este, en Rusia, allá en los inicios de la Guerra Fría, donde los rusos eran los malos de las películas yanquis (vean una película de James Bond si no).

Pero hoy en día han pasado ya tantos años de la Revolución Rusa, de la Guerra Fría, que uno ya sabe que cualquier tipo de gobierno totalitario es malo y somete a la sociedad. Y por eso este libro me pareció demasiado. Uno ya sabe que está mal que no se puedan leer libros, que está mal que al lenguaje lo quieran achicar lo más posible, que las relaciones humanas se vean trastocadas de tal manera que el placer sexual sea erradicado, que a los niños los educan para ser soplones y delaten a sus padres, que manipulen información para mentir al pueblo... ya sabemos que está mal, y sospecho que los hombres que leyeron esto en 1949, cuando el libro fue publicado, también lo sabían. A lo que voy, es que este libro sí quiere dejarnos un mensaje que es por de más de obvio. Y no me van los libros que me tratan de tonta. Ya sé que está mal todo eso, no te decantés contándomelo con lujo de detalle.Oh dios, este libro fue el soporífero necesario para dormirme todas las noches.Debo concederle algo: me gustó mucho el final. Era lo que tenía que pasar. Algunos se quejan del final, pero me pareció lo correcto. (view spoiler)[¿Acaso querían que llegara Winston, el héroe, cuya personalidad no queda nunca confirmada, a derrocar un gobierno que lleva años sometiendo a gente sin descuido, procurando falsificar información y reducir las mentes de los ciudadanos a cerebritos no mayores al tamaño de una nuez?

2,414,414,,"If i was feeling snarky I would write this book is undoublegoodspeak, but even there my use of Un is not duckspeak.The human romance and the emotions embodied there are 1984's strong suit. The appreciation of the simple pleasures elicit appreciation as they are juxtaposed so stridently against the monolithic oppression around the main character. However, the book's center, encapsulated w/a long monograph on the formation of the new world order, is boring. wrong, and science fiction at its most superficial.There are many examples of the cognoscenti deigning to dip their toes into this or that genre only to be applauded by those literary critics who know nothing of the genre and yet feel w/certainty that this new effort is groundbreaking: 1984 is one such example.",John Devlin

2,443,443,,"I personally thought this book, while an interesting idea, was difficult to get through. I found myself comparing it to Brave New World, which we read during sophomore year. The plot seemed rather dull and extremely drawn out. It is possible that if the story moved along faster, the novel would have become much more interesting. The word choice was decent, but trying to understand the idea behind Newspeak was difficult at best. The idea behind Newspeak was expressed as the desire to have only one word in use. Which makes absolutely no sense! How can there be only one word to take the place of an entire language?! This was just one of the things i found confusing about this book. The most exciting part of this book, in my opinion, was in the Ministry of Love when Winston is forced to give in to O'Brien due to rats being put in close proximity to his face. The worst part was the twenty or so pages taken directly from the book written by Goldstein, which was extremely hard to get through and boring to read. ",Alyson Bright

It was, possibly, the first book on my way where my feelings are entirely uncertain.While I loved the parts of the book that focused on Winston and his struggle with day-to-day life within the dystopia - and the character of Julia - in Part II the book began to drag. I liked that I got some background information as to how the world had devolved into three tyrannical super states... but the explanatory sections of that 'book' broke the narration painfully and added very little. These details could easily have been pushed into the back appendix and saved the flow of the story.I also found other parts struggled from this... though I can't remember what they were, only that I had difficulty drudging my way through them.",Tegan

First and foremost, what was the point of practically half the book? What did it even add to the story? There were so many useless scenes added to the story that did nothing to advance the plot. Also, the characters were almost painstakingly shallow. At first, I actually felt there was something being done to build the characters' persona, but I was sadly mistaken. The characters' were like broken records or insane people. It was either the same tune over and over again or they completely switched tunes and played with that for a while. The worst part is the end, when you realise that so little happened in the book. So, so little. It was just that Mr. Orwell decided to add useless fillers between events or just drew out an event for fifteen pages for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Everything was so slow paced. However, I thought the ending was the best part and the only part that truly showed what Big Brother and the Party were with a big bang.

2,481,481,,"To sum up 1984 by George Orwell I would say he makes it very clear big brother is always watching. However, big brother is not always so nice. 1984 is an indirect description of control and dictatorship at its finest. The story and plot may become confusing to the reader as it messes with ones mind and makes the reader also believe someone is always watching. The story does however allow you to a paint a picture of parts of the story with its detail as in how winston (the main character) cant even create a journal of his own because it is illegal. The recommended age range for this book would be High school ages and above. I personally did not did enjoy this story. This was not enjoyable for me because i do not enjoy knowing what could have been illegal and being made to think that every move i make unless otherwise stated is wrong and illegal and could have harsh consequences.so from the book, the real question is: is it possible to remain human in and inhuman world?",Sheryl Beam
2,482,482,,"Okay, this review will have spoilers, but I'll hide them. I will say, without spoiler, that this book could have been amazing. I gave it two stars because the writing was very detailed. I could see it. I knew what the hall looked like, the house, the coral. I KNEW what he was seeing. But two stars is all I'm giving for that, and here's why... (view spoiler)[ I followed this book, I felt the build up and the suspense, I loved it four stars worth... until he started reading Goldstein's book. That's when the story began to fall apart, when I realized that there wasn't going to really be a story at all.  (hide spoiler)]At this point, it really felt like Orwell wrote everything up until then just so he could give a long drawn out speech about a society that could have been and if it had been, it would suck. And I think I may have still clung on to liking the book, I would have overlooked the lecture part, if at the end, there was something to walk away with, some point to the story. There were just so many parts that I could not get on board with. Let's start with his meeting with O'Brien. O'Brien told him that there would be no group meetings, there was not an organization. Winston would take his orders from O'Brien, himself, or maybe one or two other people. Though Winston held high suspicions of everything and everyone throughout the book, why not even a slight apprehensiveness here? Why not question why he might have to throw acid into a child's face or spread a venereal disease? If you are questioning everything about your society and world, why blindly grasp on to this line of reasoning without even asking about it? And Julia in all of this? In earlier conversations, she had stated quite clearly that she had no desire to rebel like this. She wanted to rebel mentally and sexually, but that was all. And yet, he denounced everything for her, he said that she would also throw acid in baby's faces. She only spoke up when it came to them separating. Why? She was a strong woman earlier, very strong in her stance on only being a rebel from the waist down. She knew that his form of rebellion is suicide. But now, in the presence of O'Brien, she was mousy. She apparently wanted this too and had not a word to say otherwise.Then came the book of boredom. I kept waiting to read something to the effect of ""so the government using mind control by lacing the Victory gin and using subliminal messaging in the Tele's"" but no. Just Socia-Political garble again.Okay, so then they were caught. And it was O'Brien that was the Thought Police. Saw that coming after the meeting. And they start torturing Winston, okay... but why? O'Brien says to make you back to a good little follower so we can kill you then, as a believer... You know, because that's how we do it. We go through all this time and effort for no real end effect, just to kill you after you re-convert. Oh, and somehow, we can actually read your mind. Huh?And in the end, what was that? He was a good little lazy boy? What was the point of the whole thing? Of him knowing society and the government was wrong? Of him loving Julia? Of any of it? Why tell me a story like that? If not one single thing came of it, what was the point? There was nothing to hold on to, in the end. If, let's say, he was that shell of a man, but had constant dreams of Julia, his perfect love, though he could not recall who she was... only the feeling of that perfect happy... I could hold on to that. If, he died with her name on his lips, I could hold on to that. If she turned out to be the bad guy, or O'Brien turned out to be the jackass he is but was ALSO Goldstein, or Goldstein was actually Big Brother, or anything that was actually a twist, a plot, or somehow monumental or even pretty big, I could hold on to that. But this story just ended kinda blah. It was just This guy thinks the government is wrong. He realizes they are jerks. Some hot chick likes him and they get together. He then makes a friend from work who he thinks hates the government too. He promises to do mean things to get back at the government if his friend asks him to. But what? His friend ends up being a governmental prick and torturing him until he really likes the government. Then, he doesn't like his girlfriend anymore and he gets to drink gin all the time and the government doesn't change at all, and the girlfriend doesn't really like him anymore either. The end.

I'd forced myself to get that even far as a result of the all hype surrounding such a 'classic' book, but in the end I did not enjoy it at all, and getting to the end of the next page was an immense challenge. I'm going to put this down to the writing style of the late 1940s when it was originally published, and there was a very difference literary style with which authors hooked their readers, and unfortunately that has left the book today earth-shatteringly dull.Back in those days, I'm sure the portrayal of the UK as a Soviet-esque dictatorship where every single aspect of people's lives is monitored and controlled would have been somewhat thought provoking, but it feels obsolete in a world where people going through school and university, where it's most likely to be read in the first place, have only heard about the Cold War from books and movies.

2,507,507,,"I don't agree with George Orwell.Granted, he has experienced more of the pitfalls of humanity than I have (apparently his misgivings about communism as a political platform stems from his experience in the Spanish civil war), so I'm willing to forgive him his cynicism. Regardless, I stil disagree with him.In this essay (commonly mistaken for a novel) Orwell presents and elaborates his view on humanity and political theory. He uses two constructs to represent these fundamental ideas - the entity known as Winston represents humanity, and the entity known as the Party represents implemented communism.The entire setting, and any character development, can be safely disregarded - though you will miss out on a few nice quotes, Orwell was a damn fine writer.It is not until humanity, aka Winston, starts reading a book called The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism that Orwell's essay actually begins, and anything that happens before or after this part is in fact not really necessary. I would even go so far as to urge you to not read anything after humanity stops reading this book, mainly because Orwell's cynicism turns into pure sadism. Orwell feels that there is no way humanity can be redeemed. We are, at heart, selfish beings whom ultimately only care for ourselves. There are no higher values we can aspire to, we are simply biological machines hard-coded to prioritise ourselves over others, and this is what we all boil down to when presented with our greatest fears.The only way to govern such biological machines is to substitute hope with fear, love with hatred. By creating an immortal political construct based on these raw emotions, and keeping the population oppressed by manipulating information and constant warfare, stability can be maintained.This is not a future Orwell wanted, but it was a future he predicted.I don't believe him. His experiences lead him to believe that cynicism was the answer, and he is entitled to his opinion. I can only disagree with him on the basis of my own experiences, and I do so. Vehemently.

2,523,523,,"Sigh :( So I guess this book goes on my ""tried to read"" shelf. After reading this book for almost the whole summer, I finally gave up. Maybe it was because in my anxiousness to finish this book I looked at its wikipedia article and found out what happens(a mistake on my part). Or maybe it has something to do with the fact that it fell flat compared to Orwell's other novel, Animal Farm. The same topic, yes, but in a more boring drawn out way. One of those classics that you hear about, read and then get disappointed because the book was so hyped up. At least that's what my experience with this book was. SO I guess you want to know what this book is about. Well, the info you see when you first click 1984 pretty much tells you what you need to know. A young man named Winston lives in a totalitarian society where the government virtually controls everything almost everyone does. Big Brother, the government I guess, is what is constantly mentioned in this book. At least the 50% I read. So, don't take it from me, read this book yourself. Maybe I'll join you in 10 years which is probably the next time I'll ever pick up this book again. But, I predict that you'll be on my side when you are unable to get through this book: Animal Farm is/was better. ", Imani ♥ ☮
2,525,525,,The reason why I didn't like 1984 is because at Some points in the book I got confused and I also don't like this type of books. I didn't understand the plot I always got lost and I found it kinda weird how he wanted that one girl and wanted to something with her. The fact that they treated people and wanted to make they think the way they wanted to is something that seem like weird . ,Kimberly Ajualip

2,536,536,,"Very bothersome and disturbing, but well done. This was the first 'negative utopia' book I recall ever reading. I like the comment in the afterword that suggests a reader has one of two outcomes after a book like this: to feel discouraged and give up on mankind, or to feel disturbed and strive to be better and improve mankind. Reading the afterword really helped me put the book in context and not impose unintended messages upon the work. I was forced to look at my parenting style after reading 1984. Do I employ slight methods of torture and reward to teach what I deem to be correct principles? For example: ""You two need to stop fighting over ________ or I will need to throw it away."" Is that an Obrien way of teaching? Curious. I was fascinated by the ways of 'doublethink' that my husband and I were able to identify in our current society. I imagine I'll read this book again far into the future to stir my brain up and reflect on the current trends of society in another two decades or so. It's a quality book when it transcends so many time periods and still maintains its driving force. I imagine it'll be just as striking in 2030 as in 2010, if not more so.I'm glad I could quickly get a few other books under my belt after finishing 1984. Achk. Very well done.",AnnaMay

2,546,546,,"Spoiler Alert!Overall, I thought the book 1984 was a good book. The book, however did leave you asking questions that the author, George Orwell, did not necessarily answer. One question that i had after reading the book was about O'Brian. Was O'Brian part of the underground brotherhood or part of the party? Another question i had was that if O'Brian was indeed part of the party, why did he give Winston a book describing how to undermine the party? Yet another question I had related to Julia; was she tortured by the rats, like winston almost was? George Orwell definately made you think while reading this novel. He sometimes even leaves you contradicting yourself and your opinions and beliefs. This was a very thought provoking novel that could be read many times without discovering all the hidden meanings behind Newspeak words and the doublethink philosophy.Besides these lingering questions i think the novel 1984 was a different, but comprehendable book, that i would recommend to another student.",Bailey Coder

2,564,564,,"George Orwell è considerato il grande padre del genere distopico, ed è proprio con 1984, uno dei grandi classici del genere, che dà il via questo filone catastrofista.Ho voluto leggere questo libro spinta dalla fama che lo precede, e dalle numerosissime opinioni positive lette a riguardo.Ora, sarà perché questo non è stato il mio primo approccio al genere (ho letto altri libri ambientati in scenari apocalittici), posso dire che non solo non mi ha affatto entusiasmata, ma ne sono rimasta completamente delusa.Una buona trama, sicuramente originale per i tempi in cui fu scritta, ma raccontata in modo piatto, ripetitivo e noioso.Per tutto il libro non si fa che ripetere i medesimi concetti all'infinito, come se fosse stato scritto pensando ad un lettore tipo un po' tocco.Il mondo che ci viene narrato da Orwell è diviso in tre grandi superpotenze Oceania, Eurasia ed Estasia, costantemente in guerra fra loro, ma allo stesso tempo completamente indipendenti.Non c'è scambio di informazioni, notizie e cittadini tra una superpotenza e l'altra.Le uniche notizie che provengono in Oceania, dove vive Winston Smith, il protagonista della storia, sono quelle che il Grande Fratello fa passare.Non c'è libertà di informazione, di pensiero, di agire, eppure tutti paiono avere la convinzione che questo sia un bene.Lo slogan del partito (“La guerra è pace, la libertà è schiavitù, l'ignoranza è forza"") è una contraddizione continua, ma nessuno sembra porsi domande a riguardo.Il linguaggio verbale è ridotto ai minimi termini per impedire il più possibile lo scambio di opinioni e pensieri tra un camerata e l'altro.La storia non esiste, il passato è manipolato e modificato in base alle necessità del momento.In tutto questo clima di repressione, Winston pare essere l'unico essere umano ancora capace di pensiero, l'unico ad avere un senso critico, e una certa memoria storica.Cito un esempio che mi ha particolarmente colpito: un comunicato annuncia che la razione settimanale di cioccolata sarebbe passata dai 30 ai 20 grammi. Nessuno se ne lamenta ovviamente, sanno che non possono. Eppure il giorno dopo, durante la mensa, Winston si accorge che alla TV passano in onda dimostrazioni di gratitudine verso il Grande Fratello per aver aumentato la razione di cioccolata a 20 grammi settimanali!Lui si guarda attorno in quel momento e si chiede: ""sono l'unico a ricordarsi che solo ieri avevamo diritto a 10 grammi in più?"". E dalle facce che gli stanno attorno pare proprio di si.Come è possibile questo?Il protagonista non se lo spiega, io non me lo spiego (parliamo di cioccolata insomma! Se ti diminuiscono la razione da un giorno all'altro dovresti ricordarlo!) e nemmeno Orwell ce lo spiega. Ebbene si, perché alcuni concetti li ripete fino allo sfinimento ed altri non li sfiora nemmeno di striscio.Gli abitanti dell'Oceania erano tutti più o meno consapevoli, come Winston, ma fingevano di non esserlo per non avere ripercussioni?O erano solo troppo stolti e superficiali da porsi domande e indagare per ottenere le risposte e quindi, propensi ad accettare per buono tutto ciò che la TV gli dice (come l'italiano medio), o erano drogati?Il gin della vittoria da cui sembravano essere dipendenti era una droga?Comunque, tanta carne a fuoco in questo libro, tanti spunti di riflessione, ma affrontati in modo deludente.I risvolti, fatta eccezione per qualche particolare, sono prevedibili, come lo è il finale.Manca di emozioni, non è avvincente, non suscita, come invece un libro del genere dovrebbe, rabbia, rancore o senso di angoscia, che dovrebbe scaturire dalla totale privazione della libertà descritta in queste pagine.Il rapporto che nasce tra Winston e Julia, la camerata con la quale egli intraprende un rapporto amoroso clandestino, è superfluo, non porta a nulla se non alla ripetizione, per l'ennesima volta, dei soliti discorsi, e al desiderio, sempre più forte nel protagonista, della tanto agognata libertà.Quando poi a Winston viene consegnato dal camerata O'Brien, il famoso libro di Emmanuel Goldstein, la ""bibbia dei ribelli"" raggiungiamo definitivamente l'apoteosi della noia e della scontatezza.Per lunghissime e interminabili pagine leggiamo un vero e proprio libro di storia che, col senno di poi, continuo a chiedermi quale senso abbia avuto.Perché O Brian gliel'ha consegnato?Qual è il senso di fargli conoscere e credere dell'esistenza di certe cose per poi convincerlo dell'esatto contrario?Le cose che erano scritte in quel libro erano reali o un mucchio di balle come quelle che tutti i membri del partito sono soliti raccontare?Nella parte conclusiva, ovvero quando finalmente sembra accadere qualcosa, si ritorna nella monotonia.Orwell sotto le vesti di un O'Brian torturatore, si traveste nuovamente da maestrina e ci racconta ogni minimo particolare della cospirazione (e quindi della trama del suo libro) per poi rimangiarselo un istante dopo.Davvero sembra che Orwell abbia preso tutti i suoi lettori per cretini, mancava solo che ci facesse dei disegnini e ci mettesse vicino l'insegnante di sostegno.L'ultima parte della lettura vede Winston torturato in maniera orrenda, e che nonostante questo continua, inverosimilmente, a ragionare lucidamente.Ed è quest'ultima parte ad avermi regalato le poche emozioni che ho ricavato dalla lettura di questo libro, ovvero disgusto e insofferenza.Disgusto per le atrocità descritte, insofferenza perché è stato davvero snervante leggere una serie infinita di dialoghi come questo:“Tutto quel che riusciva a desiderare era di poter tenere ancora quella fotografia tra le mani, o almeno di poterla vedere ancora per un “po'.« Esiste! » gridò.« No » disse O'Brien.E attraversò la stanza. C'era un buco della memoria nella parete opposta. O'Brien alzò lo sportello. Non veduto, il piccolo pezzo di carta andava girando su se stesso trasportato dalla corrente d'aria calda e quindi veniva distrutto da una fiammata. O'Brien si volse alla parete.« Ceneri » disse « e senza possibilità d'essere identificate. Polvere. Non esiste. Non è mai esistita! »« Ma è esistita! Esiste! Esiste nella memoria. Io me la ricordo. E tu te la ricordi. »« Io non me la ricordo » disse O'Brien.”In conclusione voglio fare una riflessione.Qualche mese fa mi sono ritrovata su Facebook a confrontarmi con una scrittrice esordiente che criticava la saga ""Hunger Games"" senza nemmeno conoscerla.Tralasciando il fatto che a mio parere non si dovrebbe mai giudicare un libro che non ha letto, e che sentirlo fare da una scrittrice è stato davvero vergognoso (per lei, non certo per me), il punto è che lei vedendone il film ha giudicato il libro, come banale, una storia già vista, trita e ritrita.Poi, vabè, ha pure aggiunto che ogni cosa ormai è stata scritta, quindi mi domando per quale motivo lei si ostini a scrivere, ma stendiamo un velo pietoso e andiamo avanti.Io avendo letto la succitata saga, le ho risposto che avrebbe dovuto farlo se proprio ci teneva a denigrarla, e che a me era piaciuta molto, perché anche se poteva ispirarsi (come lei sosteneva), a qualcosa di già visto, io non avevo mai letto nulla di simile.E anche se lo avessi fatto, non avrebbe avuto importanza, perché quella saga mi ha saputo emozionare e tenere incollata alle sue pagine come pochi libri hanno fatto.Tutto questo per dire che 1984 sarà pure considerato il padre del genere distopico, e libri come ""Hunger Games"" potranno, da alcuni, essere considerati sempre e solo libri che si ispirano ai ""grandi"" senza esserne all'altezza, ma non è assolutamente vero!Perché per giudicare un libro non occorre aver letto tutto lo scibile umano e i precursori di ogni cosa.Un libro per essere considerato un grande libro deve emozionare, e questa è una cosa assolutamente soggettiva. E 1984 (per me) non rientra affatto in questa categoria.",Muriomu

The world the author created was interesting - Big Brother and its ever reaching arm instilling both order and fear into the populace. A world of total submission and absolute beliefs was poignantly described. However, I have no connection with the main character, or any characters at all. Considering the era it was written, this book is clearly a statement of anti-communism. It's ironic that the book tried to show the dangers of propaganda yet it in itself is a propaganda against big government. Story as a whole, did not really captured my attention.

2,583,583,,"Lord, was I relieved to finish this book finally. I did not enjoy it.First, let’s get this all out of the way: 1984 is a masterpiece. I see it, I know it. The ideas that were presented in this book, when it came out in the years immediately following the Second World War, must have been alarming and exciting and breathtaking and humbling and poignant and everything that is the best that literature can do for our brains. We need books like this to point mirrors at ourselves and our cultural behaviors and get us to see what slippery slopes we’re on all the time. But I’m not someone who can read for ideas alone; I never have been. This book is so narratively clumsy I could not fathom how it got from one part to the next. The pacing was glacial. The story lacks action precisely because our protagonist rebel, Winston Smith, is almost a totally internal character. He observes without acting. He seethes without breaking. His thoughts are not interesting enough—or varied enough—to support this narrative.How about the repetition problem? Over the first fifty percent of the book, Orwell describes, at length, the world in which our characters are living, both through narration and through what we see of the world and Winston’s place in it. That’s great, that’s fine. But then, for some reason, the next quarter of the book goes by while Winston reads from Goldstein’s book, which repeats—at length—everything we learned already, except in even more encyclopedic terms than before. Then he has a brief conversation with Julia, and then he reads more. Another good five to ten percent of the text. And then, when the story has finally ended, the book adds another lengthy essay on Newspeak, again to describe things we have already heard, both used in practice by the characters and described firsthand, way back in Part 1, by Syme.The Newspeak essay is actually labeled as an appendix, so, OK, that’s all right. I can live with that. What it felt like to me was one of those internet guides for die-hard fans. The Fanatic’s Guide to 1984. Can’t you see it? A guy on a message board writes: “Hey, everybody, I put together an essay that delineates all the rules of grammar and usage for Newspeak.” Comment: “That’s awesome dude!” Comment: “Plusgood!” Inevitable snide dismissive comment: “You have too much time on your hands.”I cannot even conceive why so much time was devoted to Winston reading the rebel book, however. It’s smack in the middle of the text, and lets all of the narrative tension dribble away minute by minute while it’s becoming caught up in this needless detail. I didn’t think I would ever get through this section. I thought I might die first.Though Winston was a moderately complicated, conflicted lead character, the people who surrounded him were not special. I would have liked more of O’Brien before his major character shift. A better indication of why Winston thought he could trust him; something other than that there was just something in his face. I actually liked poor Syme in his one scene, although I guess his quick, clean demise made the desired impact better than anything else.Julia was the worst. A symbol, not a woman. Winston “falls in love” with her because she is sexually promiscuous and he lacks human connection, not because there is anything special about her, because there is nothing there. She doesn’t say a single interesting thing throughout the entire book. She’s a rebel with no fire. She’s like of those talking dolls with the three set phrases they can say, and one of hers is “Let’s have sex.” We’re supposed to feel allied with her! We’re supposed to think she’s on the side of right! Aren’t we? I don’t even know. And let’s not even get started on the proles, and the dripping condescension the narrative has for those dumb, animal creatures and their beer and their gambling and their wide, wide asses.It gets two stars because the world would not be the same without it. It gets two stars because I hated everything else about it.",Erin W

2,588,588,,"I read this book in class.It was a bit too descriptive for me. I just wanted some action to happen so I was impatient and the book was ruined for me. Though George Orwell had a marvellous idea of creating this world where the citizens were manipulated, thinking the government is actually saving them from a past that may or may not have happened, and oppressed. No freedom of speech, freedom of thought. Their whole life was controlled by the government. Geez! That is seriously depressing! I noticed though, in a way, the society of 1984 defines what our world is like, just more harsh. Like the media. Which I hate. It's manipulating us with false stories and advertisements. Making girls feel like they have to be skinny to be beautiful etc.",Leya
2,590,590,,"Was expecting more of a dystopian, flowing narrative with social and political commentary built into the plot. The dystopian quality is certainly present, but Orwell jumps between a weak storyline and long lapses of political discourse. Ideas are presented in the most extreme way possible as 1984 centers around a world where the powerful will use any methods necessary to remain in power and strengthen their rule. The story is largely lost in the messages Orwell brings and although he does present interesting social and political ideas, 1984 is fair at best in its delivery. ",Darin

I understand that it is proclaimed as one of the ""classic, must-reads"", and I am glad that I have read it, but I don't think I can say I actually enjoyed it. In fact I nearly gave up about half way through, with only what this book is seen to be by many that kept me going, more than the enjoyment of it.Considering it was written in 1948 I can see why so many people rave about it, and why it also seems to get used a lot for literature classes at school (I am glad that the Orwell book I was given at school was Animal Farm over this!), especially with what the subject matter is (totalitarianism and what Orwell predicted for the Cold War), but I just didn't get it.Despite all this I still believe it is a book that should be read, if only because you may get more enjoyment out of it than I.

It does have some interesting twists but I really just didn't like it. It didn't affect me in anyway other than realizing how good our government is and not crazy. I think the narration style was good writing in third person. I don't think society would accept this book very well it would frighten society of what could happen to the government.

It was fine, but not a favorite of mine. For someone who likes science fiction, it would be a fantastic novel.

2,611,611,,"2.5I was excited when I found out that 1984 was part of my curriculum because I generally enjoy dystopians. What I got, was rather disappointing and not at all what I expected.From the very beginning, I found it slow and boring. Nothing about it piqued my interest and I couldn’t get past the first few pages. Since I had to read it, I forced myself to pick it up again and sat down and read the whole book through from beginning to end to get it over with. Once I got past the first part, I didn’t think it was that bad, but still don’t see what all the fuss is about.Most of my issues with the book stem from the fact that I do not like Orwell’s writing. Everything is repeated multiple times and whole pages are devoted to a single topic. I can’t put my finger on exactly what bothers me, but the whole book could have been cut in half without losing anything. Goldstein’s book is the most boring thing I have ever read and I still don’t know how I got through that part.The plot is painfully slow with very few interesting scenes that happen mainly at the end. However, the reedeming factor of the story is that the society is very interesting and realistic. I could see our society getting to this point in the future. I don’t know enough about politics to say whether or not that aspect of the story was realistic, but a society where the government wishes to control everything is extremely likely. I would hate to live in a society with no privacy or freedom of speech. The ending is disappointing, but I liked it because it is realistic. The idea of controlling thought through the reduction of language is extremely interesting and not something I’d thought of before. If you take away certain words, it becomes impossible to express certain concepts or even to think them, resulting in complete control. As an avid writer and reader, this thought is very scary as I love the variety of words in the English language.Winston is not someone you’d peg as rebellious, which I liked, but I know nothing about him. Or Julia for that matter and the lack of character development bugged me. Other than their appearances and ideologies, I know barely anything about them. I also found Winston to be a bit stupid at times which didn’t make much sense, because the fact that he has his own thoughts proves he’s intelligent. Also, their relationship comes out of nowhere.It’s sad that the plot and writing were so bad, because the book had some really cool ideas that could have been the focus of the book. On the other hand, explaining things more would have taken the mystery, and subsequently the terror, out of Big Brother. Still, it could have been a lot more engaging.So, unless this seems like something you’d like, I don’t recommend it.",Roselyn - bookmarkedpages 
2,612,612,,"1984 is a story about a dystopian London, controlled by a totalitarian government called The Party that controls all elements of life, even thoughts, through hidden cameras and spies. The government wants all people to be the same, and the way they do this is that they prohibit free thought, love, and anything that makes a person an individual. This shows a theme of the dangers of totalitarianism. The main character, Winston Smith, feels anger towards this government and begins to rebel against it by writing down rebellious thoughts in a journal and having a secret love affair with his co-worker, Julia. One day O’Brian, a member of the inner-party who works with (and is believed to be a rebel by) Winston, invites him and Julia to his house, where he tricks Winston and Julia into getting caught by the thought police, and is taken to a building called the Ministry of Love where Winston and Julia are tortured and brainwashed to love the government. By the end of this long period of torture, Winston and Julia are broken people who no longer feel anything and instead only wish to be the perfect citizens under their government. It’s hard to pick a favorite character from any of the few characters because they’re all very simple characters. From the small amount I’d pick Julia, because she only cares about trying to stay positive in the terrible society under The Party. She wants to live in the moment and not get caught, unlike Winston who seems to want to wage war while being pessimistic, or O’Brien who turned out to not be a rebel at all. I don’t think the author intended this effect, because I think none of the characters are supposed to be relatable, instead they’re just there because Orwell needed characters to prove his point about totalitarianism.I think this book was not what I was looking for. It just spreads an extremely depressing idea that people are weak and that they can’t fight their oppressors. 1984 is, I feel, much too wordy. The story has such a simple plot that takes so long to read with so much of the text being empty things to try to make you think that these characters matter, but in reality they could be replaced by anyone. I wouldn’t personally recommend this story to anyone I know, as it’s very depressing and has a kind of disappointing ending for such a long story of rebellion, but it also spreads a very important message; Totalitarianism is extremely dangerous.",Dylan C

2,627,627,,"THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR. ENGLISH TEACHER FOR SHOWING MY CLASS A 5 MINUTE VIDEO ON YOUTUBE DETAILING EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE BOOK BEFORE HANDING IT OUT TO US.Seriously, he did that. He did that. I protested and he just shrugged as if to say ""Who cares? Doesn't matter if you wanted to read it on your own--like I assigned you to--and enjoy it.""This happened maybe a week ago, so the feelings have subsided but I am still miffed only because of the very idea that someone deliberately spoiled a book for me, but already this book is too heavy-handed for my liking, so I stopped midway through chapter 4.Yep, this book is crap to me. The idea that a country would ever stoop so low as to become a completely totalitarian state without any sign of a coup de etat or it being a victim of a war that effectively crippled it to its enemies (Like Japan and WWII, only we just got rid of the imperialism and instituted USA-friendly ideals). You know what's so ironic? The fact that this book projected what would happen in 1984, and during 1984 two of the most capitalistic and staunchly conservative leaders of the West were in power, that being Ronald Reagan of USA and Margaret Thatcher of UK.Dude, as long as there are conservatives who wholeheartedly believe in the good that capitalism has on society and the people living in it, there is no way this would ever happen. Every time Obama sneezes there is a Republican ready to jump on his neck. We may have a few laws that invade our privacy or waive away our rights (if you look like a terrorist, teehee!) but overall we are unaffected by any attempts to subdue Americans. Here's a few more thoughts on what little I read about the book (along with the movie that Mr. ET showed me):So who cares if they rewrite history? Um hello, history is known by those who have experienced it. If Oceania eliminates and destroys records of them being a war with this nation and this, the people of the other nations are still going to hold the truth that, ""um, yes you did you goddamn liar"". It doesn't matter if someone denies it or not. As long as someone knows the truth, it's fine.It's like, if America decided to claim that slavery never happened, there are the countries of Portugal and England to say, ""Uh yes it did. We brought them over to YOU."" Even if we deny it, the truth of what really happened is still in those two nations' consciousness and history books, so it's not like just because we say it didn't happen that no one will know the truth. WE wouldn't know the truth but somebody will, and that's good enough for me. Keeping ideas and memories alive, even if you are not the one who is able to remember or comprehend first hand, in any way possible is better than it being lost to the sands of time, anyway.Also, Mr. ET brought up the very poignant idea that George Orwell obviously underestimates human nature. There is NO WAY that people who know that there is something out there yet can't quite grasp what it is wouldn't be curious and try to find it out. It doesn't matter if you are threatened with extreme punishment a la death/execution, the curious monkey in us needs to know, and Wilson is hesitant to find out or proceed to uncover more information at first (from what I gathered from the little that I read). He KNOWS about the inaccuracies in the announcements and changes them as is his job. He has more information about what really goes on in the government than the average citizen does...Another thing: Why the hell are there prostitutes and a black market if Big Brother controls every aspect of Oceania? I know there's probably an undercurrent of an answer but I'm just asking this to be an ass. Is it like The Handmaid's Tale where they allow some ""reprieve"" to its citizens so they don't revolt? (For The aforementioned book, the ladies were gathered and killed a man that supposedly had raped someone. Letting all that anger out is good for the soul).I guess I'm sick and tired of people in the US complaining that we're turning Socialist or Communist. Dude, you don't even know what that is. You don't. Even. Know.We still have many different cereals and cars and clothing brands to choose from, don't we? Yes? Good. Because that's the opposite of Socialism/Communism. Teehee!And I think we as Americans actually underestimate what a bunch of impertinent little shits we can be, and are on a daily basis. Other countries can't understand how rude and arrogant we are and how we can get away with acting like this. Well we were like this to begin with! And that's something we celebrate every day. People may say that we've grown fat and lazy and too disillusioned to take action where action is needed but when faced with a serious threat to our livelihoods we step up where the government fails to rectify immediately or in a timely fashion (Cough) Katrina (Cough). And that... Is what America is about.That and making everything our business and trying to control everything so it's our own special blend of dysfunctional and ""well, it's good enough"".",Loveliest Evaris

A bit similar to Mel Gibson making a bloodbath of ""The Passion Of The Christ"". It says more about the mind of the author and creator than the story-lines scenario. It could have been a lot shorter and still got its point across. Oh well. I'll have to snoop into George Orwell's life a bit: see if he was a nutter.The whole time listening to this story I kept thinking, ""What would North Korea make of this?"". Is this account really that far off from bits of humanity we have seen over the centuries? (Nazi's, Stalin) Not fully. Although, like the author shows: Most people who want power insist on using it for luxuries and self fulfillment. That is where this story goes insane (which might be Orwell's intent), can absolute power survive on its own? How pointless. The only way something this stupid could actually function is if Satan himself convinced some very stupid humans that it had superior worth and dignity. Because all humans have desires and passions - it's in our very heart and D.N.A.. To hide or suppress that for no ulterior motive than the sustaining of power is unthinkable, even those in-charge would be willing to die for the sake of meaningless power and control.But this did remind me of the Biblical account of the Tower of Babel: Genesis 11.The Tower of Babel1Now the whole earth had one language and the same words. 2And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. 3And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. 4Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.” 5And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built. 6And the LORD said, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. 7Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another’s speech.” 8So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. 9Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD dispersed them over the face of all the earth. So: One language, One people (*or party?), One belief, one ambition and purpose at the cost of the individual...The horror part is the verse where God states: ""Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.""As Mr. Orwell showed us, NOTHING of mankind's evil was impossible. Even undoing people's thinking and rationality. Destroying Love and desires and family for the sake of ONE PEOPLE. Just goes to show - God knows exactly what He's doing. Good thing He keeps confusing us. Now if we could just confuse North Korea a bit more.________________________________________________Although it was fascinating that George Orwell had religious belief as an enemy of THE PARTY. Most atheists would easily include any religion as mind numbing blind oppression. But as we can see: the opposite appears to be the truth. Atheism has a blind destruction of all that is good in the name of? Well...? That is the problem. Atheism claim human Altruism as a general goodness.Altruism: the belief in or practice of disinterested and selfless concern for the well-being of others.At what cost? For the greater good can be a horrible thing. Especially if it's for the good of the PARTY or People, at the expense of the individual. How far do you suppress the person to achieve group longevity? And who's version of good rises to the top: It would be a group consensus that obliterates the individual's desires and self fulfilling dreams. And as we know: everyone is a hypocrite in a few areas. That bit is what made Orwell a genius: Have Power be the individual BIG BROTHER - all citizens are squashed under it's insistence. Thankfully all atheists live lives based on borrowed bits from religious morality and meaning. (God Bless us all.)That is why The Bible insists in Love, Joy, Kindness, Patience, Justice and Mercy. Of course you can't do some of these without Protection of your loved ones and fellow human beings. But to protect might mean to condemn or discipline (sorry rapists, pedophiles, kidnappers, sexually immoral, liars, thieves, you get the idea - the Bible says you are not welcome in God's society.)That is why we must fight certain oppressors and abusers of Good. Indeed: Good trumps Power any day. And since we really have no agreed upon human Good (definitely NOT power) we best appreciate God's goodness being handed down to us.",Rod

2,672,672,,"1984 by George Orwell there's a Utopian society where the people are controlled by Big Brother who represents their government and must be careful not to commit ""thoughtcrime"" or negative thoughts about the government. Winston, the main character, hates Big Brother but doesn't know how to verbalize it. Later he tries to overthrow the government but is tricked into trusting a member of the ""Inner Party"" or someone a part of the government. He is then brainwashed and tortured into ""loving"" or conforming to Big Brother again.I really did not like this book. It had no joy at all.

2,696,696,,"Orwell got it wrong. Not everything of course. Ideas depicting future in which systems of manipulation and control are part of everyday. Ministry of truth deliberate information manipulation. Though crime, double think and similar are just amazing. Furthermore, the ingenious elimination of redundant words and concepts from the language show how systems of manipulation may be used against population in order to eliminate the way to speak your opinion. By means of eliminating the idea behind opposite opinion of the party directives. However, in my opinion the reasons behind are completely wrong. And I am especially disagreeing with the concepts behind the book. I strongly doubt that reasoning presented in those chapters would bring us the society Orwell depicted previously. Big brother as a setup and icon of a leader is plausible but party would always be led by ambitious members who would doubtfully be happy to relinquish their power to someone else especially if they have the ability to stay hidden. Likewise, they would try to utilize their family connection and since some cultures take especial pride in nepotism I strongly doubt that the top 2% as described in the book would function as Orwell envisioned it. To conclude I recall the movie In time which there is very controlled switching between the regions or wealth groups. ",Nenad Cikic
2,697,697,,"As is typical of George Orwell, this book is a ""philosophical blockbuster"" showing his idea of what the world is going to come to if totalitarian leaders were to successfully take over the world. the interesting thing is that the odds of such a totalitarian state do come to exist it wouldn't last very long, as we can observe from reading about the rise and fall of the roman empire. i find the details of the book rather gruesome in a sense, in how it shows all the details of Mr. Smith's paranoia of big brother and how big brother controls people by making people love it. my opinion is that there is no way in this day and age, with this many people on earth to actually set up said totalitarian state. i gave this two stars because i don't think George Orwell took a statistics class, or ever studied the subject for that matter. i actually find Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"" to be much more probable statistically.",Kyle

At any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom. ***Julia, in any case, seldom had an evening completely free.

It looked almost exactly as it had looked before - nothing had been crossed out - but it was one name shorter. It was enough.

'Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,' he said sententiously. 'It's insidious. It can get hold of you without your even knowing it. Do you know how it got hold of me? In my sleep!

'She listened at the keyhole. Heard what I was saying, and nipped off to the patrols the very next day. Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh? I don't bear her any grudge for it.

2,736,736,,"I should've given this book a million stars, the logic and the whole government Orwell created (the way it is probably the most fascinating character ever written, because it does act as a character on its own, with its Party members as its physical manifestations) behind it is fantastic. I dishonored it on purpose though because, ultimately, unfortunately, this book is pointless. The story begins when the beloved Winston is caught- i.e. when the readers' hopes and dreams are dashed. The whole point of the story is that there is no hope. I challenge any aspiring dictator, despot, WHATEVER to live up to the standards given here. In fact 1984 contains a complete (and conceivable nowadays, what with the state of technology and whatnot) guide to Ultimate Power. Only it won't work. Why? Because humans screw up. A lot. Screw ups mean incongruences, incongruences mean red flags in someone's mind, red flags mean awareness- and awareness is the end of Big Brother. Which is why this book is as relevant as a book talking about the day aliens take over. The aliens will be just as superior over the inferiors-humans, party members, proles, whatever-but aliens don't exist, and neither does Orwell's superhuman race actually creating (and holding power over) this world they create. But alright conspiracists, say this book's huge plan /does/ work and somehow human stupidity is overridden, taken care of, covered up by conspirators, whatever. This book, even if it plays out in real life, even if it 'warned us' (although the necessary changes should be too subtle for us to notice, which means one day Big Brother will Be Watching and I'll still be sitting around arguing that the plot will never come to life)- even if all that happens, the point is that this book is STILL pointless, because Orwell was genius enough to think up such an amazing plot but wasn't considerate enough to give us a means of escape other than the idea that there isn't one. Maybe I don't 'get' the whole point, that it's a horror and that I should have fun being horrored, or whatever. I gave this two stars rather than one because of the sheer genius behind it, but didn't give it the other 3 stars it deserves because, at the end of the day, no one is going to go kick B.B. ass because they read this, and no one's going to get all huffy and inspired to change the world after this. 1984 spreads awareness, sure, but it spreads stagnant and useless awareness.In short, this book is important because it presents an immensely important danger no one has worded so completely and eloquently before. It is unimportant because it hasn't helped anyone at all, and for all we know we could be living in what will turn into Oceania and we'd never know. And even if this book was just meant to be enjoyed in a hot tub with a box of chocolates or whatever it /still/ fails because the reading is unimaginably mind-numbing and the plot is wholly unsatisfying. *SPOILER*Nothing happens.

There was a serious feeling of childishness to it. No great mysteries abound, no multilayered characters begging to be unwrapped and closely examined. No likable characters come to think of it.

Since physical and psychological torture is so central to the story, it was interesting to read after Unbroken, a book that describes its actual practice and effects. The fictional version certainly seems academic in the face of real abuses experienced by real people. This book is contrived as a thought experiment, and its impact is lessened (for me, at least) by comparison to actual events.It's certainly well-written—George Orwell knew what he was doing, and I enjoyed his prose—which adds a star to my rating.

Totalitarian regimes set in dystopian times are nothing if not intriguing as the narrator takes you through the day to day life in a world similar to ours but wholly different. For the first 20 or so pages we get a good delving sense of the protagonist's fears, desires and morals, not to mention a hearty heaping spoonful of helpless resignation. Then a girl who he finds hot decides she'd like to make some sex with him and the plot gets all tense and sweaty with sexual tension for a few pages... and then... it... just... drags... on... and... on.... and... ON!I felt almost no conflict after this point save for a lingering background fear of getting caught. The novelty of Big Brother and the ministries of information wore off after their initial descriptions. And I don't know, maybe we've had too many movies about Nazis, but the phantom gestapo-ness of the thought police just felt played out by the time I said ""screw it"" and closed the book in favor of something that would hold my interest.I know, I know, this is sacrilege. I know, I know, I'm probably just not smart or hip enough to ""get it."" Maybe so.

2,771,771,,"Everyone must know the story of 1984 and the hell it spawned when someone used it an inspiration for a television show. Written in 1948, Orwell envisions a world under total control from Big Brother. We follow Winston Smith who, like all good heroes, begins to question the world around him. He hates following rules and follows his heart instead when he falls in love with Julia. For me, the concept was better than the execution. There was too much exposition and not enough narrative. There was also of information thrown at the reader, at one point, we read a secret text book with Winston. This book is the big ‘What If’ following the Second War World, more deserving of a place in Non Fiction as an essay rather than a novel. I admire Winston for asking all the right questions but doesn’t ask upon them. You could argue that he can’t but its defeatist.I hoped to read this book feeling empowered. I wanted to read about the system being challenged, even a force as big as Big Brother can be defeated and brought down. Instead I found myself pushing towards the finish, I skipped parts and skimmed for plot. I understand the importance of this novel but it’s a classic I could not get along with.

I really liked the first part because there's more story in it, it's not just focused on politics and you meet new characters. I didn't like the characters but felt compassion because of what they had to go through. And then the third part comes and ruined the story again.

All of the ideas presented in this novel are fantastic and still applicable in modern life. The discourse was supreme, and if I only had a copy of The Book and its ideals to pour over in real life instead of THIs book, I would buy it immediately. That said, George Orwell decided to present these ideas in a fictional novel. These novels generally require some sort of plot, and characters with development, an intriguing setting, etc. 1984 had none of these things. The characters were bland at best and scathingly pretentious at worst. Julia and Winston's relationship? Unneeded. All the side characters? Why?!! Honestly, the characters and lack of a plot were my biggest problem with the book, because without these items, it makes it that much harder to get your ACTUAL point across. I mean my lord!

2,818,818,,"I have found my experience with the canon of important books to be uncomfortably lacking, and recently decided to mend that. This was the first on my list. Well, now I know what everybody was talking about. That's good. As far as reading experience goes, though, I wasn't really engrossed at all. The ideas of the novel, while promising, were never thoroughly explored, and it didn't have the virtue of interesting characters to make the reader care much about the ideas. Basically, the novel portrays a world where everything is controlled by the Party, everything is seen by the Party, and everything comes from the Party. The slightest twinge of disagreement or disobedience to the party is punishable by death. The ones who keep living live by keeping their mental eyes willingly shut (or perhaps more accurately, willingly glazed over). History is constantly edited by the Party, and once the changes are done, there is no evidence but human memory left to contradict the new records. Orwell spins a world that says that the strength of mental conviction isn't enough in the face of overwhelming numbers. Eventually, all that a person holds dear can be turned on its head, and the opposite is willingly accepted with voluntary blindness.As far as I know, it's impossible for me to totally ignore the truth when I'm deceiving myself (how would I know if it was possible to completely deceive myself? hmmmm... nope, still don't believe it, even through the irony). This kind of mentality wouldn't happen over a large area; certainly not globally. The system both controlling the information and the punishment for disobedience would have to be far more sophisticated than any police force in history to convince people to willingly deceive themselves, and so far, that's never happened. I don't see it ever happening, especially not with the internet in place.The most interesting idea to me that this book presented was never pursued. At one point fairly early in the plot, the point is briefly made that fervent depravity is more virtuous than any morality imposed by the brainwashing Party. The idea of voluntary virtue is never even touched on. Those three separate angles would have made an interesting tension, but it wasn't explored.Perhaps my opinion of this book will shift in time, but at this moment (approximately an hour and a half after finishing the thing), I don't see that it told me anything valuable other than the explanation of what exactly people are referring to with Big Brother, and the necessity of keeping my space free from spying devices.",Michal

Still, I tried to go into the book unbiased, and found that it wasn't quite as bad as I was expecting. I enjoyed some of the bits towards the middle where the evil government gains a bit of personality and backstory; the explanations of how all three of the world superpowers remain in a state of constant warfare were particularly intriguing to me. However, the bits that catered to my interests were overshadowed by the parts that were a chore to read, like that awful excerpt from the Brotherhoods' guide that was like grinding a steel saw blade into the back of my head.

The concepts set forth in those chapters were kind of fascinating, though hard to get through the theory, circular reasoning. Most of the events that occur after the critical turning point that comes immediately after have me a bit puzzled. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the reality of what actually happened, but that might be the wrong way to approach it.

2,828,828,,"The book 1984 really opened up my eyes. It contained a lot of scary things which made me think of how the society could work. In my opinion, Winston was brave to be against the Party. It's always good to have such people. Even though he did not win over them, he was against the bad people and that was a good start in the book. I never thought that he and the so called rebels would lose. I think that it would have been a more exciting book if Winston and the Brotherhood could have taken Big Brother down. 1984 is not exactly my type of book to read, but it was good anyway because the story is deep and thrilling which I like. I got scared when Winston got tortured. I thought it was the very end for him, but instead he made it out alive but brainwashed. To live a life that is not normal and with so much propaganda in it is messing up people’s minds. I really believe that we are lucky today who can live with freedom of speech, write our thoughts and have democracy. It’s the people who are living on earth who should decide for themselves how it should be treated. Not just one person or group.

Don't get me wrong, the book was very well written and was able to trigger many of my emotions. I just get this pit in my stomach every time I think about reading it.

What is a classic? And what makes a classic novel? According to nearly every list produced by every opinionated and reputable source, George Orwell's 1984 is a classic novel.Call me Emmanuel Goldstein, but I wouldn't call it a classic. Well, maybe I would. It's not the classic part I have a problem with so much as it is the attachment of the word novel. 1984 is a classic essay on the theory of political science. In fact, of all the essays I've ever read on the theory of politics, it is my favorite.Admittedly, I feel a little stupid. You see, there are these “novels” that people call classics. Many of them I love. Occasionally, however, I come across one that makes my head spin. What is it that fans of literature see in books such as 1984 or Camus' 
The Plague
? There is no story, no character development—nothing that makes these works literature. Clearly, I'm missing something here—an unabashed love for the most “classic of classics”—and for that I feel really, really dumb.What makes 1984 so great?Where are the rounded, interesting characters? Winston is boring. Julia is drab. O'Brien is the greatest menace since the Ferengi first terrorized the Enterprise on Stardate 41386.4. Was Orwell's intent to show how these characters were devoid of personality because of their environment? Possibly. Even so, that doesn't mean that it has to be done so poorly (see David Mitchell's 
Cloud Atlas
 for clues on how to create characters and tension within a oppressed society).Where is the story, the experience for the reader? When it comes to actual story, 1984 is spread thin. I estimate that about eighty percent of its content could be removed without any damage to the story whatsoever. Orwell tells the reader about the history of the world for forty pages, tells the reader about the semantics of newsspeak for the next twenty pages, and then shows the reader a few pages of actual scene.So what am I missing?I will admit that Orwell was right on throughout much of his incrimination of big government. In a satirical fashion, he nails what the superpowers have been up to for the last seventy plus years. Periodically he may have been a little off, but largely he was spot on. He was one smart cookie; however, that doesn't mean that he was one talented novelist.Regardless of the techniques and how well Orwell did or did not utilize them, the problem was that in the end I was not convinced. The story didn't draw me in. The characters held none of my sympathies. The world they lived in was as artificial as the cardboard cutouts of a high school play. Point made, Orwell? On many it seems it has been made. Me, I'm not a believer.",Chris Blocker

For a start, the characters (especially Julia) feel underdeveloped, and there's too much emphasis on plot. More frightening than the story (which is, no doubt, scary) is the fact that everyone who has read it - and many who haven't - will repeat zombielike about how prescient it was. It was never Orwell's intention that this anti-Stalinist cartoon would distract people from what's actually going on in the world, but that's what's increasingly happening.",Laurence Thompson
2,877,877,,"It is not terribly good as a novel. As a political or sociological statement, I am not sure: I have spent my entire life being told the book means one thing, but coming to it after reading the first few chapters of 1Q84 it appears something else entirely. I am not sure if this ambiguity is the fault of the book or merely a point in proof of Andre Gide's statement, “Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But since no one was listening, everything must be said again.” Reading the one star reviews is evidence for the latter- Millinneals (and one on the cusp of Gen Z!) are quite good at calling their elders on true BS. If this is a book about the state taking away choice, why is the only place where that occurs so absurd? While the realistic items are about individuals renouncing freedom for a prize. Indeed, the book has surely become something it was not at its creating. Now off to see what 1Q84 makes of it.",loafingcactus

2,898,898,,This book was very hard for me to follow. There were parts in the novel that I was unsure of the point which George Orwell was trying to get across. Winston the main character in the novel is against the world which he lives in. The government is completely totalitarian and those who do not comply with the government are hunted down and totured. This is exactly what happens to Winston. He holds a book of secrets about the government. This book is so dangerous that Winston is caught and tortured over it. After brainwashing has taken place Winston is allowed to return back into society. He no longer hates the government for which he lives in. He is free to live his life under the rule of the government. I think this is an alright book. The literature within it is very hard to follow at times.

2,914,914,,"یادداشتی نقادانه، نسبتاً بلند و کاملاً شخصی درباره ی کلیتِ ""هزار و نهصد و هشتاد و چهار"" نوشته ی جورج اوروِل و کتابهایی از این دست:چارلز داجسون، یک ریاضیدان و فیلسوفِ مشغول به کار در دانشگاهِ آکسفورد، در اواسطِ قرنِ نوزدهم نظریاتی مبنی بر احتمالِ وجودِ دنیاهای موازی و امکانِ جا به جایی میان این دنیاها را در محافل علمی مطرح کرد. ابتدا در انجامِ این سخنرانی ها مردد بود و عکس العملِ دیگران نیز او را از کرده ی خود پشیمان کرد. او رساله ای در بابِ این نظریه، به شکلی داستانی نوشته و بدونِ درجِ نامِ اصلیِ خود منتشر کرد تا توانسته باشد ایده ی جالبِ خود را به محافلِ غیرِ آکادمیک منتقل کند. موفقیتِ کتابِ اول باعث شد که داجسون شش سالِ بعد، ادامه ای بر آن کتاب نوشته و روانه ی بازارِ نشر کند. کتاب های ""ماجراهای آلیس در سرزمین عجایب"" و ""درونِ آیینه"" به ترتیب در سالهای 1865 و 1871 با اسمِ مستعارِ لوییس کارول به چاپ رسیدند. ""ماجراهای آلیس در سرزمینِ عجایب"" تا امروز هم از بهترین نمونه های مطرح کردن یک نظریه بر بسترِ داستان محسوب می شود. به نظر من، مهم ترین دلیلِ موفقیت و جاودانگی این اثر، شناخت و استفاده ی درستِ داجسون از قواعد و امکاناتِ ادبیات داستانی بوده و نه تسلطش بر علومِ تئوریک. نویسندگانِ دیگری هم هستند که بدونِ اشاره ی مستقیم به مضمونِ موردِ نظر و حتی بعضاً با اشاره ی مستقیم به مباحثِ تئوریک، به جای پُرگویی و اظهارِ فضل، ""داستانی"" روایت می کنند که به شکلِ هنرمندانه ای حاوی مفاهیمِ پیچیده ای نیز باشد. کسانی چون آلبر کامو(که پیش و بیش از آنکه نویسنده ی کتاب های داستانی باشد، یک فیلسوف است)، کسانی چون گوستاو فلوبر و لئو تولستوی(که دغدغه های تربیتی خود را بدونِ دادنِ نصیحت های بیش از حد و موعظه های اخلاقی واردِ نوشته ی خود می کنند)، امیل زولا و ماریو وارگاس یوسا(که با رمان هایشان در واقع تاریخِ اجتماعی وسیاسیِ مللِ مختلف را به شکلی زیبا و بسیار ""داستانی"" تصویر می کنند) و یا کسانی چون فئودور داستایفسکی و فرانتس کافکا (که تفکراتِ فلسفیِ شخصیِ خود را به همراهِ دیدگاهها و تحلیل هایشان از رفتارِ انسان از راهِ روایتِ داستان هایی جذاب به خواننده ارائه می کنند) و البته یوستین گاردر که به نظرِ من مثال خوبی برای داستان گوییِ موفقیتِ آمیزِ یک غیرِ نویسنده ست. با کتابی که مضمونش در نگاهِ اول هیچ پتانسیلی برای ""داستانی"" شدن ندارد. او با دنیای صوفی ثابت کرد که حتی تاریخِ فلسفه می تواند جذاب باشد. اما کتاب هایی هم هستند که گویی به عالمِ ادبیات دخیل شده اند و هر کاری می کنند به جز روایتِ داستانی جذاب برای خواننده؛ تنها کاری که به نظرِ من اساسِ یک کتابِ خوب است. برای من به عنوانِ یک علاقه مند به ادبیات، نظراتِ آلوده به همزاد پنداری های بی جا و نگاه های بیش از حد جامعه شناسانه و بسیار استعاره آمیز درباره ی یک اثر، نشان دهنده ی یک چیز بوده؛ این که آن اثر فاصله ی زیادی با چارچوبِ مدیومِ خود دارد. به اعتقادِ من کسانی که تمامِ هنرشان استعاره پردازی های بیش از حد و ایجادِ توهمِ ارتباط با مقوله هایی بیرون از داستان، بدونِ ایجادِ پیوستگیِ حقیقی و درونِ چارچوبِ روایت است، شایسته ی هنرمند نامیده شدن نیستند. متاسفانه و معمولاً این طیف نویسنده ها همواره ایده های نابی برای نوشتن دارند که این امر سببِ دو چندان شدنِ تاسف به خاطرِ از بین رفتنِ یک ایده ی بکر می شود. رمان هایی هم هستند که پس از خواندنشان، برای حسرت خوردن به جز ایده ی از دست رفته، دلیل یا دلیل های دیگری هم داشته ام. برای من هزار و نهصد و هشتاد و چهارِ جورج اوروِل، بهترین مثال برای چنین کتاب هایی ست. کتابِ ""هزار و نهصد و هشتاد و چهار"" را پس از تعریف ها و پیشنهادهای زیادی که از سوی دوستانم به من شد، به دست گرفتم. اکثریتِ کسانی که کتاب را خوانده بودند آن را یک ""شاهکار"" می خواندند و از همزاد پنداریشان با قهرمان و جامعه ی کتاب می گفتند. اوروِل تمامِ تلاشِ خود را می کند تا پیش بینی های منحصر به فرد و جذابی از آینده ای (به زعمِ خودش) مشخص ارائه کند؛ اما این رمان که به همراهِ اثرِ دیگرِ اوروِل (قلعه(مزرعه)ی حیوانات) طرفدارانِ بسیاری در کشورهای جهانِ سوم و یا تحتِ سلطه ی نظام های ایدئولوژیست مانندِ ما دارد، در فضاسازی و خلقِ شخصیت های جذاب و توصیفِ وقایعِ داستانی به معنای فنی آن ناموفق عمل می کند و به دامِ ایجادِ توهمِ جذابیت با ارائه ی آن پیش بینی های محتمل از این آینده ی محتوم می افتد. پیش بینی هایی فرامتنی که کتاب از ایجادِ اتصال با استفاده از زبانِ ادبیات و داستان میان آنها و دنیای امروز عاجز است. از روی تکرارِ بدونِ هدفِ این تئوری ها می توان تشخیص داد که حتی خودِ اوروِل هم مسحور و مبهوتِ قدرتِ مثال زدنیِ خود در مجسم کردنِ یک نظامِ طاغوتی می شود. ناامید کننده ترین نکته ی این کتاب برای من به جز هدر رفتنِ یک ایده ی مرکزیِ خوب، در خواندنِ بخش های مربوط به زندان بود که ""داستانی""ترین بخش های کتاب هستند؛ چرا که تنها با خواندنِ آن بخشِ کوتاه بود که متوجه شدم اوروِل که یک جامعه شناس و نظریه پردازِ مهم است، می توانست یک نویسنده ی فوق العاده خلاق نیز باشد. اینجاست که من به عنوانِ یک خواننده افسوس می خورم که چنین ایده ی پر مایه ای با آن پتانسیل برای تبدیل شدن به یک اثرِ جاودان(به دلیلِ درست)، به یک رساله ی ضد آرمان شهری تقلیل یافته و به دستمایه ای برای نقل قول های سبک و کم مایه در شبکه های اجتماعی برای اظهارِ فضل بدل شده است.",Rasool
2,915,915,,"It was quite interesting to read how George Orwall thought about how the World was going to be like in the future. This book made me think about social control, safety and security. Some issues I recognize during this time are that many things we do on the internet is getting saved somewhere.In many cities and shops in the world you find cameras nowadays. Like in the story,are we in the picture. This story tells us what can happen if you are opposed to a party and how the leaders will act if you do not listen. A motive that I found was pressure. Winston and many other people felt pressure on their shoulders. They could not have an own opinion or be themselves. Orwall discribed very well how Winston was thinking and that made it easier to understand how he was standing in the situation. I would not recommend this book directly, because there happend so many horrible things and unthinkable situations in the story. The language was difficult, with many additives and because of the fact that the author wrote a lot of details was it hard to get the full attention to the story. ",Sanne

En ik ben ook blij dat ik het gelezen heb, maar ik denk dat het niet het goede moment was om te lezen. Ik verklaar. 1) Ik heb er drie weken over gedaan. Dat is heel lang voor mij. Dat is dus geen goed teken. Het is ook zo’n negatief geladen boek natuurlijk, daar had ik niet altijd zin in, eigenlijk.2) Ik viel bijna elke keer in slaap na drie-vier bladzijden als ik in bed las. Dat had ook te maken met het feit dat ik me de laatste weken gewoon echt vrij slecht gevoeld heb, mentaal en fysiek. Dan val je in slaap van kapotheid, blijkbaar. Maar los daarvan vond ik de schrijfstijl ook gewoon niet bevorderlijk voor mijn leestempo. Ik had het gevoel dat het verhaal maar niet vooruitging. Dit had best spannend kunnen zijn, maar dat was het dus niet. Ik vermoed ook dat dat niet de bedoeling was van de George, maar toch, weer een minpunt.3) Ik wil het genre 'dystopische boeken' nog niet volledig afschrijven, maar na 1984 heb ik toch wel de indruk dat het genre mijn ding niet is.

Parts of were easier to get through than others, but overall, it wasn't as interesting as I expected. 1984 is certainly an important book, and a government that rewrites history and watches your every move is not only creepy but something that I could see happening. The references to Big Brother make a lot more sense now, and I certainly get why the book in general is referred to a lot.There's certainly a lot of describing going on, and I think that contributed to a lot of my boredom while reading it. I will admit that it's not for me, and I get why people like it. I'm still glad I read it, and I can certainly appreciate how relevant it still is, as well as the influence it has on the dystopic genre as a whole.

Had I read it around 1949 when it first was published, I probably would have been drawn deeper into the whole ""Big Brother"", ""The Party"" fears and really gotten into the book more. Also, I kind of like a story that has some good things to happen to the protagonists. However, Winston Smith has no such luck. He lives in a society that controls everything to the extreme. Even certain thoughts are illegal. It is truly a negative Utopia. I don't think it's giving anything away, (the book is over 60 years old after all), to say that Winston Smith isn't a hero and he doesn't change the world he lives in. This is the story of Winston Smith and his relationship Big Brother. Worth a read, but not at the top of my list.",Brad Barker

But the bars which we meet today are much higher than that.Pioneering the concept of the big brother, an authority which abuses absolute surveillance, the book will surely get the blue side of you.But for how long can you keep reading a detailed description which goes nowhere?

2,980,980,,"The point of this book is to make us think, but, I found myself with very little reaction to any of the ideas being thrown around by Orwell. If I had much of a reaction it was to the stupidity of Winston when he blindly trusts O'Brein. Annoyance for Julia for only rebelling in because she wanted sex. Disappointment when the old man turns out to be the Thought Police - that I did not see coming. Unlike the rest of the book. Sure, I couldn't give you the exact details about what would happen before I had read it myself, but there was nothing unexpected outside of the Old Man, which even then, I could have deduced on my own. Some works can get away with predictability, but the characters need to be interesting. Not so here. 1984 was better than most of the books school has forced upon me, and there is no loathing of the book as I set it down, but, it was not particularly liked by me. ",Autumn

Specialy Julia is the most boring and flat character I have ever read about. He tried to disguise a communist regime as a futuristic controlling, horrifying government and failed in trying so.

It was well written (at lest ended up that way) but I feel more time was needed to invest in the characters. Half the novel was solely on the society instead of characters in the society and I wanted more. The ending was a nice touch... Finally an ending that would seem true to the story. Kudos for that.

Now in retrospect, I see that if I still rant about how hopeless, depraved, and meaningless this story was, there is no reason for it to have a ""liked it"" rating, and I should fix that.I would never recommend this book to anyone as a pleasurable reading experience; the only reason to read this is to have a literary and cultural experience.

Winston Smith just doesn't have the courage or moral fiber to be an effective protagonist, not even in the role of a failed hero who succumbs in the end. His failure wasn't only inevitable, but not even emotionally compelling. I value 1984 more as a warning and a wake-up call than an enjoyable work of fiction.",James Walker

2,993,993,,"During the month of April I read 1984 by George Orwell. It is dystopian novel that was based off a ""negative utopia"", that is a startling vision of the world. Winston Smith,is employed as a records editor at the Ministry of Truth. He was very depressed and even oppressed so he then starts a journal of all of his rebellious thoughts against the party. The bad thing is, is if they discover the journal, they would execute him. So, Winston only writes when the view of the telescreens aren't in a certain place in his house. Winston becomes curious about ""the brunette""(Julia), a machine operator in the fiction department. One day he received a note and it said ""I love you"". They had a secret love affair. As they fall deeper in love, he realized that things don't seem right. He wanted to know how and why the society was created. You would think he found out, and lived happily ever after? See what really happens. It is something you would not expect! This book gives you trouble to keep reading after page 30. It really isn't interesting, but give it a chance and it isn't so bad.

From the beginning, I knew this was Orwell's objective, but I really had to feel the emotions that this book forced on me to make a resolution to myself never to let this happen. I was rooting for Winston til the last, so much so that I found myself repeating over and over in my head,""Please don't give in- for me"" and I realized Orwell was writing about this generation when he talks about the 'new-speak' generation.

Big Brother is the leader Oceania, future Britain and the America’s combined. Winston is against Big Brother from the start. He doesn’t remember life before the revolution, but he thinks it was better, so he wants to bring about a change. He does his best to rebel against the government by having a love affair and joining an underground group called the Brotherhood.Overall I just thought this book was alright. I think once I let it sit more and I think critically about it I might grow to like it more. The end reminded me a bit of City of Glass by Paul Auster: I was a little disappointed at first, but after giving it thought I really liked it. What I found most tedious about 1984 was that Part One in its entirety was a description of the world. I found it really boring how in depth the author went into the way of life. I didn’t find most of the information necessary or interesting by the end and it was really just tedious. In part two things started to pick up and I became was actually starting to enjoy the book until Winston started reading. Then 1984 wasn’t the story any more, but instead excerpts from the book Winston was reading. To make it worse, the book he was reading was just more description. In fact, Winston said that the book was exactly what he was thinking only written out. We already got Winston’s inner monologue in the first 80+ pages. I will admit that the book was extremely thought provoking.A lot of people really liked this book. I agree that it is very well written, but it is difficult to get through. I would not recommend this book to someone just looking for something fun and easy to read. It is a book that you really have to think over and probably read multiple times to actually understand and enjoy.",Lainey

You are led to believe that the protagonist will, against all odds, manage to forge a path towards liberation, but flipping the pages until I neared the end of the book revealed the let down.

It is no longer even remotely relevant - with the slight exception of occasional government surveillance of phone numbers and the omnipresent internet. None of the atomic bombs happened, the reconfiguration of the global powers did not happen, and quite the opposite of his discription of the Middle East is currently in play. With all of these in mind, the endless lectures seem quite ridiculous.

2,1068,1068,,"I suppose I should explain the low rating...Since its publication, 1984 has been the face of dystopian literature, the go to book for people new to the genre. Because of this I was really expecting something amazing, a story that hung on my mind for months after reading it... But I expect I'll forget this in a few days.Reasons why:1) It's a social commentary essay wrapped in a half-baked storyline. The only strength of this novel is the way Orwell describes the position of the social classes, the 'story' surrounding this is quite frankly lazy, making my emotional levels range from one to one point five. 2) The characters are terrible. The main character, Winston, is boring and I really couldn't care less about him. Julia - the love interest - falls in love with Winston for absolutely no reason, and while she starts off as a marginally interesting character she soon becomes hollow and unnecessary - she's in the scene but if she wasn't then nothing would be different. All the less central characters fade from memory as soon as you turn the page.3) The whole idea of 24/7 surveillance, while new when this book was written, is old news today. This means that when Orwell spends half the book getting us to understand what it feels like, we (or I at least) get very bored very quickly. 4) The ending. When the main character is in a worse position at the end of the book then when he was at the start I feel cheated.

I read for entertainment, so my opinion is not based on educational values, political exposure, or exploration of the human psyche - all of which have their part to play in this novel. This was a brutal, depressing vision of a dystopian future; written in the 1940s and extrapolating the possible consequences of a world ruled by communist or socialist extremism. It may be a classic but not one that will go on my favourites list. It was a real effort to wade through the long passages of twisted logic justifying the totalitarian system. I'm well aware that there have been times in modern history when the western world has faced the threat of encroachment by extremism and that there are places in the world today where this sort of society is still extant.

Basically the government known as the party controls nearly every aspect of a person’s life. The way that this horrifying reality is accomplished is through various laws that are extremely strict. The consequence for most of which is death. Some of these laws include thought crime and face crime, thought crime is when you think of defying or overthrowing the party. Face crime is when you show a lack of happiness or excitement for the party’s existence or accomplishments. Constantly paranoid of being executed, Winston goes about his life trying to follow the many rules while secretly thinking of ways to defy the party and find any way to express himself and find any bit of freedom .Winston eventually is able to accomplish this by having sex with a supposed abstinent party member on numerous occasions. However, this freedom and rebellion is short lived, for they are both caught and arrested. After months of torturing the party is able to make Winston confess his wrong doings and force feed their slogans and beliefs into his mind, Truly killing and brainwashing any fiber of defiance. After they do this, the party is able to further manipulate Winston’s now very malleable mind into having a sincere genuine love for the party. This is cut short as well however , this time by a bullet to the back of Winston’s head.",Ruben Rosas

The book may have been more relevant and even more terrifying when it was written. Today, however, it doesn't really do much. It's terrifying, really it is, when you think about it. When you're done with the book you may feel uneasy, it's natural. Half an hour later once you let it settle however it's no big deal.The main issue I had with the whole thing is that as a story it gives you nothing to really care about, EVER! The main characters aren't people you care about, if you do, it's only because you feel you should otherwise whats the point? The world, you care about that, until half way through. Then Orwell pretty much paints the most negative picture of existence and you stop caring about the world and standards and anything normal as far as this story is concerned.I hate to say that a story needs a happy ending, because it doesn't really, but if it doesn't, it needs development. This book doesn't really deliver on either.Now, don't get me wrong, its a good story, absolutely worth a read, simply for what it is.

2,1104,1104,,"After a long time of busy homework nights and trying to meet last minute deadlines, I have finally read George Orwell’s 1984. I had heard so many great things about the novel and after many busy months I was excited to finally read it. I am an avid reader of the classics; Pride and Prejudice and Little Women are two of my favourite novels. I expected to love 1984 just as much as those two novels, But sadly the novel let me down. 	I loved the idea of the story; it was very haunting and psychological. But that was one of the only things I liked of the novel. The novel was written in 1949 and is a George Orwell’s vision of what 1984 would be like. The idea of the government controlling our minds and turning us completely submissive under their power was quite chilling. “Thoughtcrime does not entail death: Thoughtcrime IS death.” Just the idea that thinking something wrong can be punishable by death is a very scary thing, and I loved it. 	However, other than that the story did not meet the standards I had set for it. The story felt very predictable, too predictable. I have read many novels that were predictable, but were still interesting to read, but this book gave me nothing- If I decided to miss a few large chunks of the novel, I would have still been able to understand what was going on. There were Big chunks of the book are very dull, and I struggled to read through them, especially near the end, when Winston is reading the book-THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM- sent to him by O’Brien. During that section of the book I was very tempted to skip over the whole thing. 	I do not have or know what my feelings towards the book are. There were things I liked and things I did not like- Right now my opinion on both sides are quite equal so I cannot come to a conclusion on whether I enjoyed the book or not. In short: The ideas were great, but the overall novel was quite dull. ",Nianna

For example, the controlling Big Brother that controls every part of a person, even their ability to think. I thought this was way too extreme and I did not like reading it.

2,1118,1118,,"The first time I read this book, I hated it. The second time, well, it still wasn't my speed but there are some parts I can appreciate.What bothers me about it is that it is more focused on ideology and the world of the story than on the characters. The characters often seemed flat and irrelevant to the true story, which is about the battle of ideologies-the ideal liberty and truth Winston seeks, and the carefully controlled dystopian reality of the setting. And me, I'm more of a character girl.Julia was the character I disliked the most. While I couldn't blame her for any of her actions-she was what she was, and what the times had made her-she was blatantly shallow and uninvested in Winston and his love of freedom and truth. She only hated the Party because it wouldn't let her do what she wanted.Winston was okay, but he never got anything done. An ineffective protagonist. Though I'm sure Orwell made him like that on purpose, to show how futile it is to rebel in this dystopian society, since it is more a story about the society than about Winston.(view spoiler)[ My favorite character was O'Brien. Yes, he was extremely evil. But he was effective, and he wasn't dull. And perhaps I got a touch of Stockholm Syndrome from the torture scenes-he presents a front of honesty that was fascinating. I loved how boldly he admitted that he didn't want to help anyone-he just wanted power. Admittedly he's a bit flat, mostly just a representative of the insidious Party. But that only makes him more interesting. Was he always part of the Party? Was he once in the rebellion? Is there a rebellion? How many people have been tortured at the Ministry of Love? Does he really believe the things he says? So many things about or surrounding O'Brien are shrouded in mystery. Of all the characters, he was the only one who didn't feel overly simple and straightforward.  (hide spoiler)]In general, I liked the second half better than the first half. It was more exciting, and less of a traditional ""fight for our freedom and love"" story. Honestly the first half is almost like modern dystopian romance, like Delirium or some such book with a little more philosophy and depression. Not that there's anything wrong with that.So, not really for me.

Story:
In this dystopian future, we follow the life of 39-year-old Winston Smith. Winston lives in Oceania, one of the 3 superstates of the world -- the other two being Eastasia and Eurasia. In Oceania, society is divided into 3 parties: the Inner Party, the Outer Party, and the proletarians. The head of this government is Big Brother, though he's just a symbol of the Party and not really a real person.The Inner Party consists of the most well-off people in this world; they have the best food and the best living circumstances. They are also the ones who controls how this society is run. The Outer Party is basically the middle class. Though even if they are the middle class, their living circumstances is as bad as poverty in our reality. Their living quarters are utter trash and their food is disgusting. The proletarians, or proles for short, don't have any better. But unlike the Inner and Outer parties, the proles can do whatever they like without catching the eye of the government.The book is divided into 3 parts. The 1st part is for exposition -- Orwell showing and explaining this world that he created. The 2nd, and longest, part is filled with how Winston lives his life. In the 3rd part, it is the story's falling action and conclusion.The world was interesting to learn about the more I read the book. It amazes me how brilliant Orwell was for thinking up of this world, a world so controlled by its government I'm glad I don't live there. It sounds way worse than a Communist country (but I wouldn't really know; I don't live in one).In this story, all those elements that make a plot interesting are there. Foreshadowing and symbolism are the most prominent. I can see why schools would like to have their students read this.
Characters:
I don't even want to go through reviewing the characters individually... *facepalm* I don't like any of them! Except maybe Mr. Charrington and O'Brien because they were the only ""cool"" guys there (they're both Inner Party members too); they are both brilliant and kind yet harsh all at the same time. The rest are either psychopaths in some way or very annoying.Well, Syme, Winston's friend and works in the Ministry of Truth, was also a good character... He was very intelligent! Too bad he got vaporized... *cries*People in this world are somewhat crazy and insane... I can't blame them. With how the government is controlling most of what they do, monitoring them, judging them, and punishing them, I can understand why they are all like that in some way. Even the children are insane because their minds are malleable.
Grammar and Diction:
The only thing I truly liked in this story. Orwell did a great job painting his world and Winston's life. It's easy to picture this dystopian future.The only problem I had with it was that sometimes his description would end up being too long or being too elaborate, and I get lost in them. There are also a bunch of long monologues, and I just don't get what they're saying in the end.There is also Newspeak (the abridged version of our language used in Oceania) in there, which adds to my confusion. I'm so glad it was only used for a little bit.
Overall Enjoyment:
Even with a good portrayal of a dystopian future, I just couldn't get into the book. I couldn't get into the story; it didn't really appeal to me.I did like seeing all the foreshadowing, symbolism, and parallelism in the story though! Discovering them was a satisfying feeling!Also, the ending was a pretty good one. It had to end this way to show that not everyone, not all protagonist, can win against something so powerful.
Final Verdict:
So I gave this book 2 out of 5 Telescreens because I just couldn't find enjoyment while I read it. Yes, it was interesting, but it wasn't fun to read. I couldn't understand the characters. The only ones I did like only appeared a few times and one of them died, so they didn't sustain my enjoyment.To reiterate, I could see why schools would want their students to read this. Foreshadowing, parallelism, and symbolism are all present and are good examples of a good story. Syntax and grammar are great. The ideals and viewpoints are brilliant.A good choice to read in an English class.",Thea Tabanas

2,1138,1138,,"of course, being the normal student that i am, the only reason WHY i picked up the book was being forced to freshman year by my english teacher. i was very curious about this type of book. i had heard mixed reviews from my classmates: how much they liked it, how they liked the 'unhappy' ending because it was realistic. i thought that since i had enjoyed all the books this year, that this one would just bring the entire semester to a pleasant end. BOY WAS I WRONG.winston lives in a negative utopia. everything in the world is completely twisted and being the conservative i am, i was a little shocked by some of the book. for instance, winston has more than a few sex scenes that i think were completely unnecessary. especially since at the end, he betrays his love anyways right?i cannot completely hate the book though. first of all, it was a required reading book and classic, so it does have its merits. the world george orwell describes is completely realistic and scarily enough COULD WORK. everything is convincing, which made me lay in bed a couple of nights just mulling over this terror and threat. it also opened my eyes to the possibility of my privacy and lifestyle being completely invaded. 1984 is a warning to us all of the type of life we should avoid. he formed it from his own terror of what our world would become, and i'm glad to say his prophecy hasn't come true...yet?but i can still loathe it for causing me so much horror right? especially the main character. most books i've read there's an admirable main character. but this protagonist was nothing of the sort. he was weak both mentally and physically, he had ulcers, and the only good point he had was some bravery and some defiance, that vanished the moment they spirited him away to the ministry of love and beat the death out of him. and in the end he caved, just like that, with very little resistance. no resistance at all, just stop the pain, was all his last emotions were. what a guy!1984 is not for the fainthearted.",Serendipity

You couldnt even think something that disagreed with the government. the book really kept me interested. i did find it very difficult while Winston was reading ""The Book"". After they read some of the book, 1984 became EXTREMELY depressing. i finished most of the last third of the book in one day. Once i had finished the book, I really started wondering about our books that i have read through my two years of middle school and four years of high school. i wonder why we cannot seem to get hold of a single book that leaves you happy at the end. Why did the government have to win. Winston becomes just like anyone else. I am astounded as to why we all wonder why teenage suicide rates are at an all time high. Not only do high school students have to deal with a depressing school environment, but also bring these books with us home where we continue to be depressed. Would it kill us to ever read a book where the good guy actually wins? If i got anything from this book, it has only helped my realize that our school has only fed its students depressing literature that our poisoning our minds. In 1984, the government shaped societies mind to be exactly what they wanted it to be. Is there any possibility that our school system is doing the same thing?

There was a lot of thinking, this is true and I understand why it was written in this way but it wouldn't have killed to have a slightly more intriguing plot. The story, while an incredible concept, was not developed the way it could have been.In addition, I was really uncomfortable with all the sexual references throughout the book. I literally skipped a good chunk of the book because I just didn't want to read about what the main character and the girl are doing with each other. I was not prepared for that, nor was I happy whenever I came across a section which contained rather inappropriate actions.But I cannot totally diss this book.

The insight into totalitarianism, socialism and general anti-mind philosophy was interesting and I became entranced in the story of the romantic relationship and the effort to struggle to find something better. I remembered that it was going to fall apart, but I found myself hoping. The final third the book was a letdown even beyond my memory. The extended description of torture is just gratuitous.

There was a lot of useless drivel to sift through, and then smack in the centre a political essay reiterating everything we had just been through before. It was like, Jesus, can we get with it?  I appreciate the time Orwell would have taken to dissect the things that make one's power, which is defined as influence over another, invincible. The answer is communication with numerous rewrites between sender and receiver, is noise even real there? The whole communication system is noise because of its intermittent changes. The weak, rather pathetic characters of the book, Winston and Julia make its seemingly hopeless ending rather believable, which I again appreciate. I loved the emaciation of Winston, I loved the torture of Winston, I loved the way he was crushed by O'Brien. I felt like the one holding the dial for the entire time.  I figured out things like Goldstein, O'Brien and the whole Brotherhood to be of course more propaganda from the start as it would be essential for this system of oligarchy to have such enemies of resistance. Only the intellectuals would have time and resources, and if only people like Winston whose feeble mind could not do much, who else was to do it? Big Brother himself.

I ended up going to the library and checking it out on tape. it wasn't a bad story, but I must say that I think all the hype around it ruined it for me. I don't regret spending the time listening to it and I didn't dislike it but I don't see myself recommending it to anybody for trying to ""read"" it again. I honestly always thought that Fahrenheit 451 was a much better thought police novel then either 1984 or Brave New World",Jeff Beland
2,1198,1198,,"Much like Animal Farm and other iconic works I've read, this hardly lived up to the hype. For the time, and laid the way, and blah blah, yes yes, but beyond that, it isn't very good, and it's rather dull. From a structural standpoint it holds up even worse, and from the standpoint of the dramatic, as outlined by the Greeks, it doesn't stand up at all. It just sort of lies there and moans about things.One of its most irritating legacies is simply that people constantly use it in reference for any kind of governmental oversight whatsoever. I'm as much a fan of the hyperbolic as the next person, but I draw the line at calling people I dislike Hitler, and I certainly draw the line at what some person thinks is a slight against their freedom as being a prelude to 1984, which is a dystopian future so bleak and so far gone from humanity that it hardly even seems a look at our future.This was probably what upset me most about it, simply that it so far divorced human free will and emotion from the humans in the novel that they weren't human at all. Any of them. Perhaps that is the point, many will say, but I'm hard-pressed to say I agree. Human will has and always will exist. Speculation of some robotic future is unimportant to me because it might as well be speculation of what the world would look like without humanity, because that's what it would be. Humans without the will to fight to live or to love are not humans. I understand why Orwell wrote it, of course, but I think having more realistic analogues that more accurately represented real life subversion and suppression of the masses would have served him better. This whole making things up and 'they knew all along' business doesn't seem very educational at all. In fact, it seems to be the primary reason we have people saying things like gay marriage will lead to beastiality or that genetically modified food will lead to deformed monstrous humans. I don't mean that Orwell started this trend, of course, but that this level of rhetoric and hyperbole doesn't really have a place in a civilized educational debate or discussion.Calling someone a fascist, a socialist, or nazi is identical to calling them a stupid-head or a doody-face in my book. Both show a childish understanding of communciation and discussion.1984 is a lark and interesting in a 'oh how screwed up will THIS be' kind of way, but so are reality tv shows (ironic because neither are very in-tune with reality).Maybe at one point this book served a very useful function of scaring the shit out of its populace, but now it only serves as a ramping up of antagonism and paranoia that is not needed or helpful.",Nicholas Armstrong
2,1199,1199,,"My rating is entirely based on my overall enjoyment of the book. Orwell's ideas are amazing as is his grasp on the utter control that can come out of a totalitarian government. I do appreciate his genius I just can't overcome how bored I was while reading it.This book is a sort of science fiction novel about the horrors of a complete totalitarian society. I recently read the book We which provided much inspiration for 1984 and I actually enjoyed the novel. I was not expecting to overly dislike 1984 because I liked We even though I was warned (by my mother lol) that it was a horrible book. I didn't really trust her judgment as we have very different taste in books. (for example she hated Lord of the Flies whereas I marveled at the genius behind it.)I also read George Orwell's Animal Farm which I found incredibly interesting since it used animals on a farm to show what the Russian Soviet Revolution was actually like. I was very disappointed by 1984 (possibly because I was forced to read this book in English class even though I was hoping to read Frankenstein). I recognized that it is a well written book that accurately displays the astounding possibilities of totalitarian societies yet I hated the book. I am sad to say I have probably never disliked a book more than I disliked 1984. I found the entire book insanely boring. The first part of the book was all about Winston's (the main character)life and the completely disgusting, completely controlled and completely awful society he lived in, the second part was all sex, the third was all torture and the entire book was boring. Chapter 9 part 2 made me want to stab my eyes out (figuratively speaking of course). The ending was as expected. (No good thing could have ever come out of this book).As much as I personally hated the book I have to admit there were some interesting yet scary premises. Just how complete government control was really came through in the novel. I found the most interesting part of government control was the constant changing or eradication of history. That was indeed a scary thought. (To live in a society where all past events were changed and people just accepted all of the lies even thought they remembered a past occurrence as being different from what ""the party"" stated.)Overall I did not like the book and would have abandoned it had I not been forced to read it for English class.

2,1217,1217,,"Orwell was a philosopher trying to be a novelist, and in my opinion he failed at both. I had to force myself to finish this (mostly I did because I was born in 1984 so I felt obligated to). The first third of the book is painfully slow and plot-less, in the middle third Orwell gave up on expressing his ideas through plot and had his main character ""read a book"" about the Big Brother society, and the last third is brutal and depressing. I think Orwell would have done better to simply write the philosophy book he had his character read and forget about the boring, contrived plot he attempted to create. Also, sex is such a common metaphor throughout the book that it was practically a fourth main character.The only reason I gave the book two stars is because it made me think about the influence of the Holy Spirit. Orwell was not a believer, and as such saw the possibility of a future with no morals, no absolutes, and a useless, broken human spirit. I kept thinking, ""Even if society was like this, SOMEONE would still know truth and stand up for it."" The reason I believe that is because of the Holy Spirit and God's promise of a remnant. It is comforting to know that, no matter how bad our world gets, 1) man was still created in God's image and that image cannot be completely snuffed out, and 2) as long as the Holy Spirit and the church remains, there will always be those who recognize and stand up for truth. The Bible seems to indicate that the Holy Spirit and the church will someday be removed from the world, and the world of 1984 might not be too far off from what that could look like, except that I think it will be worse. I would say read the book if you want to ponder that, but it's so poorly written I say don't bother--I'm sure you can find something better. ",Tamara

When Julia cane into the story it started to get good. It painted a good picture of totalitarianism, but it took until part 3 to REALLY get dark, where the power if the Party really seemed apparent to me.

2,1219,1219,,"In George Orwell’s infamous tale 1984, a dystopian society is evident. Winston Smith is an irrelevant official in the Outer Party, the totalitarian regime that rules all of Airstrip one which is part of a larger area called Oceania- the area that was once known as England. Winston Smith is part of the Records Department in the Ministry of Truth and he rewrites the way history was written. He changes up the facts. Airstrip One is dictated by Big Brother and he's not allowed to do anything that promotes free speech. With that being said, he creates a diary to escape from Big Brother, although he's only actually escaping him in his mind. Either way this act could get him killed. It is against the law. Anyways, he creates this journal to stay human, by that meaning he lives in a society where inhuman acts occur everyday and he feels if he creates this journal he'll feel some kind of normalcy. He won't feel so alienated. The only problem is that Big Brother is always watching him. They have cameras and telescreens all over the place. His bathroom, his bedroom, even at his job. It isn't safe anywhere for him to calmly write down his thoughts.A major theme of this story is the danger/fear of Totalitarianism. Totalitarianism for those of you who don't know ""is a phenomenon of the twentieth century: earlier forms of despotism and autocracy lacked the technical capacity to control every aspect of life. The term is applied both to fascist governments (see fascism) and to many forms of communism,"" (google define). It is evident that Orwell wrote this story to warn other countries of the dangers of this form of government. He has witnessed first hand the struggles of what it is like to live in a nation where everything you say or do is controlled by the laws set up by the government.I personally didn't like the book and to be completely honest with you I didn't even finish reading it.

It's clever that Goldstein was created to ensure people are kept in line, being unified by hate, and that it wasn't a problem to sow the seeds of rebellion because the few people who stray from the party towards Goldstein's influence could easily be and were routinely dealt with. Also the fact that the party broke Winston but it never had a sense of tragedy gave an inverted sense of the sublime, David and Goliath except pathetic realism. Lastly, some people dislike the inclusion of Goldstein's book explaining the party slogans but, for me that was neat, especially because of the dialectical twists and turns it contained.A lot of the same ideas about censorship and manipulation that appeared in Animal Farm were expanded upon and more were added but understanding how a paranoid old man imagined a surveillance state isn't going to do anything for me and honestly some of it is just silly._A comment not specifically about the book, I'm surprised that Orwell believes in linguistic relativity or that you don't often see people lampoon him for it.",Abdifatah

You don't form anything inside other than the vague knowledge of what you long for.

People come out of hiding after decades of oppression and terror still speaking their outlawed language, still practicing their purged religion, still reading their banned books, and with their humanity still intact. So the core premise that drives this book feels false, and therefore the book itself feels flimsy and hysterical. Reading it felt less like an experience in reading fiction, and more like an experience in studying a document from another era.Another surprise to me was to discover anew the classist nature of Orwell's theme, something I wasn't sensitive to the first time I read the novel. The 'proles' are portrayed as bestial and unimportant. Although the cant of ""if there is hope it lies with the proles"" threads through the book, Orwell makes sure the reader knows that the proles are not worth saving, and that they are too low to understand their own oppression.

2,1273,1273,,"7/10. This is undeniably a landmark classic book, and worth reading for the simple purpose of being able to appreciate the vast number of cultural references tracing back to this book. It reads more like a political manifesto than a piece of literature, and should be judged as such. The concept of the story is a intriguing one of political dystopia. Orwell included lots of interesting details to flesh out his vision, so the dystopic picture is complete. For example: Newspeak, doublethink, etc. His society had elements of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Soviet-era Russia, and Nazi Germany. However, I could not bring myself to buy the philosophy behind the dystopia, as espoused by O'Brien. This philosophy of power-attainment, ultimate control, and hatred only works if one assumes that human nature is ultimately a base, cowardly, weak, and without honor, It only works if every single person is capable of betraying everything they believe in and everyone they love in the face of physical torture. I do not think that Winston is a good representative of all humanity. I find him weak and cowardly and pathetic. Even if most of humanity would react as Winston does during his ""political re-education,"" I believe there would be at least one person who would not give in. The Party's power requires complete control over everyone, and one single failure weakens its entire power structure. In the end, I feel that this is an agree-to-disagree situation. I find Orwell's assumptions about humanity to be overly pessimistic (and almost offensive) and his political vision implausible. Therefore I cannot take the this book seriously, nor do I find it compelling.",Serenity

2,1287,1287,,"I'm afraid this was a critically acclaimed book I just couldn't like. The politics was very interesting and believable and frankly rather genius. The idea of Big Brother being able to control things the way he could, in a way dictators would if they could, was realistic and it did really make me think. However, the characterisation and the way the story was told couldn't grab my attention. For me, characters are the main reason I enjoy books, perhaps because I am interested in psychology. I thought that the characters weren't explained enough for me to relate to them or find them believable at all. This sort of devalued the whole idea of the dystopian society for me because while the politics was so well thought-out and written it could almost be real, the people in the society, even Winston, the protagonist, made no sense to me. I also found the message to be a bit pointless in the end. I just don't believe that what happened to Winston's view of Big Brother in the end could ever happen. Sorry about being unclear, I'm trying not to spoil anything. It may be my interest in psychology or my slight lack of interest in (and admittedly understanding of) politics that has led to my being disappointed in this book. I think I also like books with a little more beauty, whether that is found in the story itself or in the way it is written. Understandably this book was, of course, not written for beauty so that may also factor into my distaste for it.

Eliminating words to such a simple use as to insure no insubordinate thoughts to the lackeys of ""Big Brother would never be so was ""insane"". As much as I did enjoy that as a novel 1984 felt kind of ..blah. I think it's a great book to do a report on and I can see why so many schools use this book for that reason. It works great as that. But as I novel it was kind of dry for me. One, you don't get attached to any of the characters. Especially the main one who has some strange sexual fantasies that felt completely irrelevant to the story. Another thing was too too much narration!.Barely any dialogue, it was an info dump party.

The characters are bland sociopaths, epicureans interested in their own pursuits. The only discussion of capitalism is as a futilist's endeavor. One gets the feeling that the only options in the world are the secure but foggy and robotic society of big brother or the free, impulsive but oppressive capitalist society. Neither option describe allows any hope for betterment or change. Orwell seems to me a very depressed fellow convinced that the world is doomed to run a wheel like a hamster and the only change available is to jump on a different wheel. While his descriptions of the ever present big brother have come to symbolize everything evil about socialism and beyond, I failed to see how the book was a cheerleader for conservatism. If anything, it was a vote for anarchy where one may not have any security or hope but is at least permitted to succumb to his most abject of animalistic impulses.",Roserose

I figured that if his name hadn't gotten hooked in my mind yet, what was to say it would be later?Winston seems to have no personality save for the fact that he is against the state of Oceania. Orwell's writing also comes off as dry and uninviting. It sounded like he was trying to give us facts instead of a work of fiction and I didn't like that.In addition, I found some of the ideas mentioned to be, believe it or not, a bit over the top. It's obvious Orwell was writing about Communism, but the things he writes about are more akin to total dictatorships, not to a economic system. I don't like the idea of the telescreen that can not only see where you are at all times, but can hear and detect your every move too. That just seemed to be a bit too obvious. I also feel the time frame he gave, of the state of Oceania forming in the 50s to the way it was in the novel in 1984, was a bit too fats for everyone depicted to have become mindless drones.

2015 reading challenge: a banned book (33/50)
I'm sorry for the low rating, but by now everyone should know that I rate based on how much I liked it, not on the quality of the book.Quality-wise, it's pretty good. I can see why this is a classic and why it is very important for people to read it at school.But opinion-wise... I didn't like it.I feel like 90% of this book is just... preparation. Preparing for something ""greater"" to happen. It's just set up. It tries to create a new world, and it succeeds for a bit but... it's still pretty dull.And then when the ""something greater"" happens, it's also dull. This book is very slow and it barely feels like it moves AT ALL. You could've called this book ""Nothing Happens in the Future"" and no one would've argued with you. Weeellll... people who love this book probably would. But you get what I'm trying to say.One of the things I didn't like/fully understand is the relationship between Winston (the main character) and Julia. They work at two separate departments and yet constantly see each other. At first, Winston hates her because she's young and beautiful and works for the antisex league (or something like that) and he's fantasizing of raping her and killing her afterwards.This dystopian future promotes violence and hate and the new countries are always on war with each other, so Winston's thoughts of rape and murder are natural and probably even encouraged.For the most part, we don't know anything about Julia (not even her name), because the government doesn't allow people from opposite sexes to talk with each other if it isn't about work. So, it sounds reasonable that Julia doesn't know anything about Winston either, right?????????Except, no. She knows his name. She knows where he works. And she said she loves him.That seems very weird to me. It is never fully explained why and how Julia has so much knowledge about Winston (I think it's because the book is told from Winston's POV and focuses only on him), and the whole thing seems very insta-loveish to me. If not from Julia's side, then by Winston's side for sure. I know that in the society they live in to ""love"" someone and have an affair with them is not only a crime but it's also a very difficult thing to pull off, so as much as Winston wanted to violate Julia, it was never ""love"". He just laid his eyes on her and thought she was attractive. That's attraction.So when it comes to the ""romantic"" part, I just... didn't feel it. I was glad that things finally started to ""move"" and we were finally getting somewhere, but then things went back to being as slow as ever.Also, the age difference. Winston is 39 years old, Julia is 26. Many women find older guys to be hot, and I'm not condemning that, but I'm a woman and I know that I'd only find a 39 year old guy to be hot if he was IN FACT hot. Winston isn't attractive in the least, and I know that this story isn't really about that but it seems unrealistic as fuck that an attractive young lady would fall in love with an ugly old man without knowing much about him at all.I didn't really like the ending either but I guess it makes sense and it fits the novel pretty well. It's more of a matter of opinion: I prefer happy endings or at least hopeful endings. If you read the book, you'll know that this ending is neither.TL;DR: I can see why it's a classic and I respect that, but I didn't like it.",Isabella

2,1356,1356,,"I have got to stop finding books that seek to nourish my ""intellectual"" side. At this period of my life, I need hearty novels, not intellectual ones. Though if the novel manages to affect me emotionally and intellectually then that's a novel I need to find.In the world of 1984, the Party controls the past, and thus, man. It's a world where the Upper Class stay high, and keep the power. I don't understand much how they did it, but they managed to make people believe in lies, even when they were so blatantly false - ""doublethink"". Their slogans: 
WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTHEvery move is monitored and any small suspicion of going against the Party, you are tortured and/or eradicated. It's a world where emotion is expunged, individuality is shunned, and children betray their own parents, and the parents are proud of them for it. It's horrifying.I'm rating this based on my enjoyment of the book, thus the two stars. Like I said, all this cerebral-ness just isn't my cup of tea lately.For sure, I loved the ideas in this book. Winston Smith's struggle against the Party is relate-able and poignant. Thus his utter defeat in the end is frustrating, and generally speaks to all of us: If you don't want what happened to Winston happen to you, don't let it.The world may not turn out exactly like in 1984, but at the heart of it - the hopelessness of man - just may be possible, or is possibly happening. In fact, when O'Brien said that the proles (or the Lower Class) will never revolt, I just about agreed with him. Isn't that's what's happening now? 
If there was hope, it lay in the proles
Hope lay in the proles the Lower Class because they are the most numerous. But will they ever wake up? Will we ever achieve the Utopia?I just came to realize how utterly satisfying my life is, to be able to write this down, read what I want to read, and learn what I want to learn. We still have freedom. We won't achieve Utopia. There will always be an Upper, Middle, and Lower Class. But there will always be humanity, too, and there will always be hope. *2.5 stars.

It is an emotional tapestry of love and hope, despair and hopelessness, rebellion and submission. I really, really hated it. No other book I have ever read has given me such a profound desire to leap out a window, or preferably, to smash my brains out on anything solid enough to get the job done. A principle at the heart of the famous dictatorship painted in this book is called ""doublethink"". In the novel it is described as ""To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies-"". According to the function of doublethink: this book was amazing, and I hated it. It was beautiful crap. The reason why I hated it so much was because I knew what was going to happen. The ending was predictable because it had been predicted. The main character knows what will happen, and states it. Then... it happens. The plot really consists of a man who knows a bad thing will happen, decides to enjoy himself a little before it happens, and then the bad thing happens and the book ends.

2,1394,1394,,"I’m still trying to grasp the concept of this new world order where everyone is brainwashed into hate and abstinence. Basically any sort of natural bond is being bred out of society into the hopes that one day there will be no more marriage, children will be taken away from their mothers at birth and the act of sex will be a repulsive, yet mandatory act that will take place once a year simple to repopulate the planet. In a way, this book reminded me of Suzanne Collin’s Hunger Games series with the government conspiracies leading the people like a flock of sheep, it's pretty apparent that Collin's got her inspiration from writings such as Orwell. The fact that children are being brainwashed at such a young age and can turn on their parents in an instant is unsettling. This new order wants as little thought as possible. They are attempting to rein in a society of people and treat them like mere machines.Basically this really could be happening today. The media lies to us about the reasons behind war and we believe it. But the actual cause is what it’s always been: the middle class attempting to debunk the upper class while the lower class remains ignorant to it all. There are a few things that really make you question your own beliefs. Every day, the media floods our TV’s giving us statistics, comparing things from last year to this year and who really validates it? We expect the news reporter to speak the truth but we do nothing ourselves to be vigilant about receiving the truth. We could easily turn into this party discussed in 1984.

2,1399,1399,,"1.5/1.75Lo terminé literalmente recién, así que tengo que ordenar un poco mis pensamientos. Voy a hacer lo mejor que pueda.La narrativa es buena, no es pesada, no se engancha en describirte la vista desde las ventanas o los detalles en las sillas, pero se cuelga mucho con el pasado. De repente nos encontramos en una situación en la que no sabemos si Winston está hablando de algo que ya pasó o que está pasando ahora (p ej, la escena donde está en la celda primero llena de gente, después entra Parsons...). Lo que fue pesadísimo y me salté sin ningún tipo de culpa fue las partes en las que él leía *el* libro, y por alguna razón al señor Orwell se le ocurrió que nosotros deberíamos leerlo también. Leí el capítulo III (La guerra es la paz o algo así), pero para el I vi lo largo que era y elegí salteármelo. Si era importante para la trama pensaba volver y leerlo, pero no ayudó en nada, y el mismo Winston dice que ni a él le cambió la vida.Winston fue un protagonista super meh, que por momentos rozó el odio. Super ingenuo, paranoico, cobarde, vueltero. Veía venir los problemas meses antes pero no hacía nada para evitarlos. Se dejó llevar como un imbécil por el sexo (recordemos, pobrecito: es hombre) y al final sólo eso fue lo que casi terminó matándolo (en un final completo, de todas maneras, supongo que murió). Creía que todo el mundo era malo pero cuando llegó la hora de la verdad todo el mundo era bueno y él no tenía problema en arrastrarse de rodillas con tal de que no le pase nada.Julia una imbécil. En principio, perdió su virginidad a los 16 con un hombre de 60, y a los 26 o 24 estaba con Winston, de 39. El último caso si lo ves con amor lo dejás pasar, pero el primero me parece totalmente repulsivo y degradante, teniendo yo 16. A esta mujer no le importa nada, todo le aburre, los temas que podrían salvarla de la muerte la duermen y lo único en lo que piensa es (digamoslo en gaucho) qué verga se va a comer para ""rebelarse"". Una rebelión bastante sin sentido que es completamente inútil porque no sirve de ninguna manera para mermar el poder del Partido, sólo para que ella tenga una sensación de que es más inteligente que ellos, que al final nos damos cuenta de que no lo fue. Es superada a más no poder, no se anda con más cuidado que el básico (le alquilan la pieza a un hombre que ella no conoce y, habiéndose escondido en otros lugares con la precaución de buscar telepantallas y micrófonos ocultos, no se le pasa por la cabeza chequear que no haya ninguna ahí). La trama me pareció asquerosa. Empieza bien, pero con la incorporación de Julia todo se va a la mierda. Me parece que el objetivo del libro no se ve muy claro, o no es uno que me gusta, al menos. Quería leer una historia de revolución, no me importaba si terminaba como Allegiant (hola, esto es un spoiler pero not really porque 1-todos lo sabemos 2-no dije nada). Pero terminó siendo una de sumisión y miedo. La trama de la Hermandad hubiera sido buenísima, pero tuvo que arruinarla no sólo poniendo a O'Brien como malo malísimo (oh, bueno, le da el beneficio de la duda) sino haciéndolo invencible. El Ministerio del Amor no es un lugar del que uno simplemente se escapa, y hacer todo este mundo tan inquebrantable hubiera tenido una función interesante si al menos Winston hubiera pensado seriamente en rebelarse. Después del sexo con Julia (y dormir, siempre dormían después) se hacían los vivos y hablaban de casarse, de tener hijos, de irse lejos, pero eran dos cagones que no se animaban ni a leer el libro. Julia porque le chupaba un huevo, Winston porque ""tenía cosas más importantes que hacer"" con la semana del odio. Los personajes de verdad no pudieron ponerse a la altura de la historia, y de verdad no quería o no me importaba que no fueran héroes a lo Katniss Everdeen, que vencían al gobierno para un futuro mejor. No. Lo que me importaba era que piensen en rebelarse, en que la trama se desarrolle aunque sea 1/3 en torno a eso y que caigan después de haber hecho algo bueno. No. Ni eso.Lo que sí, el world building fue bueno. Me gustó. Y me hubiera gustado más que las clases de historia nos la de a partir de hechos, no tirándonos párrafos y párrafos con un punto aparte cada tres páginas explicándonoslo todo. Ni hablemos de los ladrillos de texto que eran los monólogos de O'Brien en la sala de tortura. Callate, papito.En fin, que un libro desagradable en cuanto a la visión de que el gobierno es invencible y la manera de describir y llevar el subplot del sexo. Pensaba de verdad que me iba a gustar, pero tal parece que mi mente no está hecha para leer clásicos.",Sereleaf

2,1416,1416,,"Aside from Ayn Rand there is no more overrated an author than George Orwell and no more overrated a ""magnum opus"" than his 1984. I've read this book several times now and every time I like it a whole lot less so that while it originally read as a timeless warning of totalitarianism it now reads like bad pulp. I expect a further reading would finish it off for good on my palate. But, let's face facts: Orwell is not a very good writer. He is applauded for his clarity of writing, and while clarity is great, don't mistake me, Orwell is too clear. Quite simply the man thinks very little of his readers. We must be battered over the head with really unnecessary and accordingly melodramatic turns of phrase: 'it's beautiful destroying words...'? So widely quoted, so unnecessary and quite silly at that. We know that this is enjoyable to the bureaucracy of Oceania. We knew it when we find out that Smith alters and destroys records. We don't need this character's opinion on the matter because all he does is walk in, give us this statement and walk out. The equivalent is talking about how sweaty the man character is, how much sweat is dripping off of him, how he must do laundry when he gets home because of this and then have some peripheral character walk on and repeat all of this only from a new perspective. A further complaint is that as I get older I've gotten a lot less tolerant of misogyny in books, and 1984 is full of these moments. Smith's wife is a frigid bitch, while his mistress is a nymphomaniac. Every female character with the exception of Smith's stockboard mother falls in either camp. You really have to go into old and lousy pulp fiction to find female characters this flat. Is this genius, some erudite commentary on the nature of fiction? No, it's just laziness. Orwell's got room for one character to make any kind of transition. All else be damned. I believe this novel, like the Star Wars franchise is largely determined by its impact instead of any true quality of the work itself. In such cases the original work gets extra mileage where it's really undeserved. In substitution I believe Brave New World is by far the superior novel and far more relevant both in terms of quality, and message. And so I say Farewell Orwell, farewell Big Brother, farewell '1984.' You've stayed far too long for your own good.",Elliott

2,1445,1445,,"War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength. Doublethink. Big Brother. George Orwell does what he does best and creates a startling world where the reader is submerged in interesting political and social statements. A disturbing dystopian future where The Party controls everything. The Party is never wrong. If they said something that did not come to pass, then the statement would be changed to match what happened. The Party is never wrong. Big Brother controls the past. What is truth? Is it what you remember happening, or is it what Big Brother tells you. If Big Brother says 2+2=5, then 2+2=5. Telescreens and microphones are everywhere; two-way devices that allow Big Brother to watch and listen to you every minute of every day. The world is in constant war. The Thought Police strictly enforce thoughtcrime.The book is very well written, and has had a big impact on today's literature (dystopian novels very popular now with the recent Hunger Games' novels). For some reason, I didn't seem to enjoy this novel nearly as much as Orwell's Animal Farm. I would recommend Animal Farm over 1984 if you were to choose only one Orwell novel to read. 1984 is definitely worth a visit, even though it is full of war, torture, and deceit.

2,1447,1447,,"Big Brother is infallible and all-powerful. Every success, every achievement, every victory, every scientific discovery, all knowledge, all wisdom, all happiness, all virtue, are held to issue directly from his leadership and inspiration. It’s always daunting to go in to a book with a massive following. Will you love it? Hate it? Will you be seen to ‘get it’, as is the case with a lot of these classics where if you haven’t read it – or god forbid didn’t like it – your street cred will never recover. Is it paranoia that I think people will be able to look at me and know that I didn’t care at all for a book that has been banned, burnt, turned into a TV show that must haunt Orwell from beyond the grave, quoted and misquoted and become something akin to a Bible of what NOT to do for so many people? Have I now missed out on joining the ‘I Read Literature Club’? Jess and Rory certainly wouldn’t let me sit at their table. I went in to Nineteen Eighty-Four fully expecting to love it. I’d read Animal Farm for school and been completely blown away by how much I was blown away. The mental image of that horse giving everything he had (even his life) for the cause, only to be turned into glue??? That was the day I died inside. I’d just read The Circle by Dave Eggers when it was decided that the challenge for my book club this month was to read a classic we’d always wanted to read but never got round to. I was not at all impressed with The Circle but I wanted to see where it all began and finally understand all those casual references - Big Brother, the Thought Police - that I’d grown up with.  One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep conviction. Syme will be vaporised. He is too intelligent. He sees to clearly and speaks too plainly. It’s pretty clear from the first few pages that there are some pretty major flaws in Winston Smiths world. Chief among them is not his horrible, festering leg ulcer, but the constant TV monitoring even in the privacy of his own home and that a person can be executed for things they might mumble in their sleep. Said execution is all done very tidily of course; a member of the Thought Police will as good as read your mind on the walk to work, whilst completing the mundane tasks assigned to you, or your dreams and you will simply disappear and cease to exist, or be publicly executed before all traces of you are completely erased. You will of course be dragged away in the middle of the night and chances are you’ve been turned in by your colleague, neighbour or even by your own righteous child. This should all sound horrifyingly and unfortunately familiar to far too many people, especially those who lived through the 1930’s and 1940’s, as Orwell did. Syme had vanished. A morning came, and he was missing from work: a few thoughtless people commented on his absence. On the next day nobody mentioned him. Winston Smith is a very quiet rebel. By day, he erases and edits newspaper articles and historical documents to represent whatever version of truth Big Brother and the Inner Party now wants you to know. By night, he writes in a diary – not forbidden but certain to lead to death – and has a secret relationship with a Julia who works the machines that churn out books following formulaic plots that the Big Guy approves of. There was always an inevitability about their relationship; they were going to get caught, the question was when and how many acts of quiet rebellion they could commit before then. It’s hard to identify or empathise with either Winston or Julia. Both have been so disconnected from their selves and the world around them and they both seem to have an empty void inside of them. Their relationship felt like a sham to begin with when Julia, a young, attractive girl in her 20’s declares love for an ageing, slightly decrepit Winston that she has only ever so subtly dared to make glancing eye contact with when passing each other in group events. It’s all made even more ludicrous when you take into account that the day before Winston had imagined bashing Julia’s head in because he hated her and everything she supposedly stood for. Had their relationship been about a desire to have sex – almost forbidden by Big Brother – instead of a supposed mutual love, I might have found them more believable and been able to (pardon the expression) root for them. Eventually the trap is sprung and both Winston and Julia are arrested and tortured for an indeterminable period until they are mere shadows of their former selves and Winston believes everything that happened was just a hallucination. Orwell depicts a pretty bleak future – all concept of individualism and sense of self is completely destroyed. Anyone with intelligence is used and then made to disappear and the concepts of Truth and Freedom of Information are the complete opposite of what their names suggest. The world has been at war for decades, yet there is a small minority, including Julia and Winston that doubt whether there has ever been any real fighting that has not been concocted and perpetrated by their own government. To want basic privacy in your own home, or quiet time to yourself, is a sign of your ThoughtCrime and crimes against Big Brother. This future is meant to be a warning to all of us about where we are and where we could be going, but it failed to really move me at all. Perhaps because I have heard so much about this novel already, or because I’ve heard its message so many times, or simply because I’m going to be one of the Proles watching it all happen and do nothing, I failed to be shocked or scared into fearing his message. Perhaps, had it been much shorter like Animal Farm, its message might have been more powerful. The novel had failed to grab my attention and the further I read the more I was channelling Prince Humperdinck and chanting “SKIP to the end!” which only got worse when Winston starting reading Goldsteins manifesto which narrated the entire plot of the novel again. While I am pleased to have finally read it, I found the reading itself disappointing. It definitely wasn’t as powerful as I had expected and been led to believe and I think it has suffered from my knowing the concept so well before encountering the book.

2,1458,1458,,I have stated in some of my other reviews that I have never been a huge fan of science fiction literature. That being said I feel that “1984” transcends the genre and is an important piece of literature. Set in a dark futuristic world “1984” tells a love story against the backdrop of suffocating oppression. The book is important for any aspiring writer to read because of how well Orwell creates the world that the novel is set in. His descriptions and careful attention to detail make the novel believable and come alive. We feel the pain of Winston Smith and Julia because their story feels real even in an imaginary world. Orwell is a master of mixing political sensibility with engaging stories.,Danny Hampson
2,1459,1459,,"This was my third and final read of the summer, and just like the others I did not enjoy it. During the majority of the book, I felt as if there was no real activity that any of the characters were pursuing. To me it seemed as if the whole book was entirerly about Winstons thoughts. I felt as if there was no real solution to the story either. In this book, any evil thought against the party could be found out easily. Ones own personal thoughts should be a private matter and the fact that absolutly nothing is private any more and that almost every action is a crime against the party and Big Brother, is basically a doom and gloom situation with no way out. Basically, at some point or another every citizen will be considered a thought crimminal and will be killed, and no one will be left living unless they are a party offical.  On the other hand I must applaud the author for writing outside of the box. Most other books that I have read on utopias, (Brave New World) create a perfect world with all of its citizens enjoying a perfect and carefree world.

2,1466,1466,,"I read 1984 by George Orwell. The main character is Winston. The story takes place in London,England. The protagonist Winston works as a low ranking member in a ruling party and it seems wherever Winston goes he is being watched by the leader of the party. He is only known as ""The Big Brother"". Winston eventually sees this beautiful dark haired girl named Julia. Winston is scared that she is a informative that is watching him and going to report him to the Big Brother.I did not enjoy this book simply because the plot was not enjoyable. It was too confusing. The author had almost to many events, so it was hard to keep track of what was going on. A part that I did not like was that at the end his face was going to get eaten by rats and I like realistic more. I would reccomend this book to any body that like a weird or different type of book.

2,1470,1470,,"Probably written at a time when communism was considered the greatest threat to mankind, the book exaggerates totalitarianism to an extent that , for me , borders on the paranoid. Usually in a book which deals with concentration of power, the protagonist rises against the powerful but the book deliberately avoids such a scenario to make the outlook grim.The book also is slightly dated since the breakdown of the USSR, as communism has been relegated to a minor role in the clash of ideologies. The lessons of this book probably though are still relevant, and for years to come it will serve as a warning against concentration of power. ",Venkateswaran
2,1474,1474,,"This book was very interesting and very deep. I thought it was intriguing how George Orwell predicted the future to be like in 1984. It seams totally outrages now that all of that could have happened in 1984, but back in 1949 it would be scary thinking that this could happen. As with most books, it stared off slow and sort of weird. I think the telescreens were creepy in that somebody could be watching your every move. My favorite part is when he gets arrested and tortured. I thought it was stupid that he was that scared of rats. Most people get creeped out at rats, but its not there worst fear. I thought the story ended very abruptly. One minute he’s about to die and then a few pages later he’s sitting in a café acting like nothing happened. Overall it was an ok book that had lots of deeper meanings. i would recommended this book to anyone who like science fiction. Genre: Dystopian Science Fiction",Bradley

2,1482,1482,,"1984 is a book I enjoyed reading, but did cause disappointment. To me, this book actually felt like a roller coaster in the course of reading it. It felt like a roller coaster since there were sections of the book when I wanted to continue reading and also parts were it just felt repetitive and uninteresting. The introduction to the society in which Winston, the main character, lived in is long and it is a confusing start to the book. The book began to intrigue me once it include the rebellious couple of Julia and Winston. Julia is another rebel among the people and has similar ideas about the society as Winston. As the audience, I was able to know what Winston actually thought about the society he lived in. Even thought he worked for the party in one of the ministries, he was against the party/government and this was a good turning point in my thoughts of the book. I then wanted to continue reading more now knowing that he was a ""rebel"". When Winston was made clear of being a rebel, it made me question what would he do to prove that what he thinks is right ? It also made me question what was he willing to do before getting caught if he were to get caught ? My questions were then answered later on the book. So both Winston and Julia decide to have a love affair and break some of the laws placed by the party to show their rebellion against Big Brother. They then trust a man named O'Brien because Winston believes that he is also a rebel and thinks just like Julia and himself. They are proven to be wrong when they discover that he is actually a member of the thought police. Both Julia and Winston are taken to the ministry of love which is the place mostly feared by the people. They are severely punished until they honestly believe anything the party tells them and gain love towards Big Brother, the leader. When they were both put through punishment, they went against each other and I absolutely hated that. The reason for me hating that they went against each other was because they knew they both were guilty, but didn't claim it. What happened to the ""love"" ? I had hopes that Winston wouldn't betray Julia even after the thought police told him that Julia had already betrayed him, but he let me down. Even thought Julian broke before Winston did, Winston and Julia are eventually brained washed due to all the punishment. Winston went through more punishment because he wouldn't sincerely believe what he was told until he was punished by using his worst fear against him. I would recommend this book to people who are interested on knowing how far a government can go to make every citizen believe what they want them to believe.",Genesis Gonzalez

2,1486,1486,,"In the book 1984 by George Orwell, Winston Smith is a 39 year old living in Oceania (modern day London). Oceania’s society is basically made up of three parties, the Inner party (Higher class), the outer party (middle/working class) and the Proles (lower class). Oceania is under dictatorship of Big Brother. Winston is a member of the outer party and works in the Ministry of truth. There are four ministries where Winston lives, ministry of truth, ministry of love, ministry of peace and ministry of plenty. Most people work for one of the four. 	Winston is the main character and narrator of the book. Winston’s personality is very stubborn and intelligent. He’s able to see Oceania for what it is, a broken, cruel and demented place. The people of Oceania all follow exactly what the government wants them too. The government has basically hypnotized the whole society but the¬re are people, like Winston that see through it. ¬¬¬¬¬ I don’t like how the society has changed Winston. In the beginning he’s a drunk and he has no real reason to be living. He’s not happy and the only way he gets through his day is by drinking Gin. Small events in Winston’s life help him keep the hope that somewhere in Oceania there are people who are revolutionists working against the government. Winston has some secret acts of defiance towards the society. Along the way he meets Julia who is like him and sees what’s wrong with the world they’re living in. They defy the government together but they know what the inevitable is. Sooner or later they will get caught it’s just a matter of time. 	I think one of the main themes of 1984 is what happens when the past is erased. One of the main jobs of the ministry of truth is that they get rid of the past. The government can have them abolish anything they want any time. It’s as if certain people and events had never happened. Without knowing the past how are we able to learn from it? Knowing the past allows us to become wise and we won’t make the same mistakes over again. A quote from the book that the government says is “ He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.” The power of the party (government) is a lot stronger than you think.	The mood of the book is pretty depressing. Winston’s character seems depressed and that influences the books all around mood. The book doesn’t end the way you think it would. Throughout the book they give you this false hope but by the end that hope is crushed. The book is very emotional but the characters within it aren’t. 	The book took a while to get exciting and worth reading. The beginning was very slow and almost boring. I understand that George Orwell wanted to explain the setting and the past information about Winston but he could’ve done it in a shorter amount of writing. By the second part of the book I was engaged but I’m not sure I would call it a “page turner.” I couldn’t really connect to any of the characters in the book and I think if I were able to that would have made the book a lot more interesting.Overall I liked 1984. I think everyone should read it at some point in his or her life. It’s not my favorite book but it was nice to read. It was different from anything else I’ve ever read.",Marisa Fujimoto

I think a lack of fear ruins it for me. But gettin' down to business - you never feel any empathy for Winston or Julia, you kind of wanna slap them actually. There isn't really any plot - you just wait for Winston to get captured - and when he finally does and gets tortured - you're just like ""ugh whatever, get a move on"".

2,1525,1525,,"Honestly, I hated this book probably because I wanted to hate it. I'm so fed up with people raving over how amazing and timeless it is and it fell completely flat to my expectations. I found it very chronologically biased, I saw no historical, political, or social meaning to it. It was an over-simplified allegory of what was happening in Europe at the time. It was culturally biased, misogynistic and just overall pointless. There were a few parts that I really loved, though. I find Newspeak to be completely genius and Orwell just does an amazing job at playing with language and putting its cultural significance across (I mean, his technique of writing is truly amazing, and who am I to judge anyway). The way he writes about how language forms thought and behaviour is just fantastic. The only other part I loved was the third chapter where O'Brien speaks with Winston. I liked it because it actually meant something, it triggered some sort of thought (although they talked of nothing new or groundbreaking) and did not leave me completely untouched like the rest of the novel. I found the second chapter particularly offensive to my mind and eyes. The love affair between Julia and Winston is just plain ridiculous. Julia is has no real character, she's just a caricature of what a silly person would think a rebel is. She has no real personality and defines herself through silly acts of rebellion that reminded me of a pre-teen acting out (maybe that was the point but I could hardly relate with/like/care for/was interested in her and her struggles. Winston is another completely flat character. There is nothing about him that different, important. Maybe that was the point - wanting to put across how the Big Brother has really squeezed all personality out of everyone. But it's just hard to believe that a person who is this willing to fight against the government and is willing to die in the process is that boring and has these boring self-centred thoughts. There just seems to be no motive. I think this book is a great introduction to anyone that has not read any philosophy or politics before. It would be amazing as a school read as I think it would engage young people more than other books that are taught in schools. Overall, one thought kept going around in my head while I was reading it and it was appearing and re-appearing as I was reading on: ""Uuugh, this is so simplistic!"" Maybe it was just not my style. Or maybe that was the author's purpose and I fell into it like a trap. Anyway, I didn't like it. ",Starbreeze

2,1570,1570,,"1984 is not a particularly good novel, but it is a very good essay. On the novel front, the characters are bland and you only care about them because of the awful things they live through. As a novel all the political exposition is heavyhanded, and the message completely overrides any sense of storytelling. As an essay, the points it makes can be earthshaking. It seems everyone who has so much as gotten a parking ticket thinks he lives in a 1984-dystopia. Every administration that reaches for power, injures civil liberties or collaborates too much with media is accused of playing Big Brother. These are the successes of 1984's paranoia, far outliving its original intent as a battery against where Communism was going (Orwell was a severely disappointed Marxist), and while people who compare their leaders to Big Brother are usually overreaching themselves and speak far away from Orwell's intent and vision, it is a useful catchcloth for dissent. Like so many immortalized books with a social vision, 1984's actual substance is so thin that its ideologies and fear-mongering aspects can be stretched and skewed to suit the readers. If you'd like a better sense of the real world and Orwell's intents, rather than third-hand interpretations of his fiction, then his Homage to Catalonia is highly recommended.",John Wiswell

2,1579,1579,,"While I was able to stay engaged and certainly read this fast enough, I honestly think it quite fails as a novel. However it has much to say that can merit discussion, and as a work of speculative fiction it serves its purpose. And in that, I'm glad to have read it. But there are certain things that just stick out to me that detract from it as a novel (distinguishing a novel as having the primary purpose of telling a story, as opposed to just making a point on a given topic.)Firstly I was struck by the disturbing thoughts of the main character: murderous misogyny and outright evil thoughts that made me wonder if I was supposed to be rooting for this guy. If I had known nothing about the novel going in, I might have thought it was going to be a tale of a serial killer. Fortunately there were only a few instances early in the book, but it set a tone for me that detracted greatly from the character. I think all the characters are not quite realized, the love affair really makes little sense - why him? why her? Isn't it really just because the other is convenient and willing? - and in fact there are many plot elements that make little sense - 7 years? Again: why? Why him? Why is he so special? - In fact, it is rather difficult to determine what the plot actually is. The premise is there, sure. But, while there are events, nothing happens. The main characters never actually do anything but move through their lives. You might get away with calling it literary fiction, but it tells no real story. What it does do is present a scenario. It describes, in detail, the way this fictional political system works and why and it shows you a conclusion to following that system to its logical end. And it would be a frightening world to find oneself in. Yet, I'm wondering what lessons Orwell would have us learn. Certainly one could spend a lifetime dissecting this work and find many things worthy of discussion, and there are many statements I could see truth in. However, I still can't help wonder about the goal, because if it was about politics, his scenario feels dishonest (or perhaps that perceived dishonesty is due to our contemporaries taking the dishonest view). As a depiction of socialism it is false (though he does mention this, I think it is often overlooked), and as a depiction of an oligarchy it is not a realistic display of how oligarchy comes into being. Perhaps where it is best equipped to make its point and teach a lesson is in the purpose and function of a perpetual war machine. Yet of all the elements of this book present in popular culture and discussion, that is an idea I had never heard brought up with the book. Which is interesting, because that is the one element most relevant today. (Oh, sure, you can speculate about whether we are being spied on, though I have a hard time believing there is the workforce to keep tabs on every average citizen, and it is interesting to contemplate what Orwell would have written had he lived in the internet age. But we actually do know for an epistemic fact that we are consistently at war, pumping more and more of our country's wealth into the military rather than spend it on the people.) But for my rating, I come back to this: it quite fails as a novel and I was disgusted by the main character and could not for the life of me understand why there would have been so much fuss about him from his ruling party.",pietastic
2,1580,1580,,"I don't read non-fiction unless I absolutely have to, for I am still a student and I like to 'get away' from time to time. This is probably why I didn't like this book, for although it's not non-fiction, it's not a very good novel either. It reads like a philosophy book, or a particularly long essay.The concept of the book was awesome. I'm all for fantasy or sci-fi or speculative fiction or dystopian fiction. Heck, I'm all for anything, really. But I just didn't like how the 'story' was told. Was there a story?

I didn't care about what happened to them at all, despite all the shit they had to deal with. My expression was a fixed, ""Meh.""It's a shame really.

Yes, the writing is exceptional. The story is probably exceptional, but it is so disturbing. To say that Orwell was ahead of his time, is an understatement. Big Brother, double speak, the thought police - all of it is so awful. What they do to people and why is too horrible for words.

2,1589,1589,,"Managed to get halfway through this miserable piece of garbage. A decent enough idea with poor execution, dull and repetitive prose, flat characters, and very slow progression. It didn't feel like much actually happened until the halfway point. What really threw me though was that I found the main character to be absolutely disgusting. There were points in the first half of the book that implied that he wanted to rape people, and this would generally be my cue to put down the book, but as this is such a highly rated book I thought maybe this would be part of his character development and that he would learn to not be a sickening misogynistic dirt bag, but by the halfway point he seemed unchanged. (view spoiler)[In fact, he met a woman who, for some reason, was in love with him, and upon telling her that he had wanted to rape and kill her, she laughed and seemed pleased that he had those thoughts. (hide spoiler)] What makes it worse is that it isn't treated with any amount of seriousness- and if you're going to bring up rape, it should be serious. It should absolutely not be a ""funny"" throwaway- oh Jim, you know Jim- tall, dark hair, wants to rape people. Absolutely sickening, I don't know how George Orwell gained such a fanatical following.Add this to the growing list of classics that make me question why people read classics. There are plenty of other choices of social commentary stories in which the main characters aren't completely disgusting. ",Jacqueline Boss

2,1596,1596,,"Having read dystpian novels for a while, I thought it was time to read one of the most famous.The psyche of the main character - the ever present need to moniter even your expression - was well written. To the point that it was depressing...but I suppose that was the intent. Total government control would BE depressing.The lead thinks he's found a measure of freedom in the old antique shop and a measure of personal pleasure/joy in the girlfriend. Antique shop is an elaborate trap run by the leads supposed mentor in free thought. The couple is caught and tortured separately, for an indefinite time period, long past the point of any successful re-programming of thoughts. The culmination is, when faced with his greatest fear, the lead begs for it to happen to his erswhile girlfriend. Sees the girl later, they are both repelled by the other. They are completely reprogrammed and quashed by the government.Issues: the youthful brutality of the lead towards his Mother and sister is at odds with his entirely quiet and careful adult situations and didn't seem to fit in.The mentor ? There is not enought time in the world to do all the things he supposedly did - foment and discover possible 'traitors of thought', monitor all the spying feeds that he kept track of, and to leisurely enjoy spending hours torturing our lead (and others. Rmember our lead was just one of many in the torture chambers). Not to mention the mentor having his finger on the pulse of the current acceptable government thought or do the job which provides his cover. This should have been covered by at least 3 characters to be anywhere near plausible. Can't say I enjoyed this book, but it was definately something that made me think.",Lark
2,1598,1598,,"My first thoughts as i started reading the book: 1. I don't think I'm going to like this book. 2. seems to be an extreme scenario. Possibly George Orwell's fear of the future - a most dreadful worst-case scenario. 3. I thought all this philosophical thought was intriguing until the part where Julia says, ""the war is probably a lie"" and 'nothing is true and none of it matters.' Shortly thereafter, I was losing interest in Winston's arguments with himself. Although I did want him to stick to his beliefs about what he saw and knew was true. 4. I somehow was not very upset about all the torture and brainwashing, though normally i would be. I think it's because by then I'd lost interest in where this book was going, but was still devoted to finishing it. -----------------------5. My own beliefs are different from Winston's. And from the party's ideas of how they could keep the power. First of all, I don't think the party would ever be able to become that organized. Second, I think George Orwell had a fear of technology and the capabilities of TVs. Third, I think it impossible to to keep a numerous and large population in order under a very strict set of beliefs. There are too many people who are stubborn and opinionated. In order to do that, you'd end up destroying 95% of the world population or else, you're party wouldn't stand. 6. The argument of Reality. I do agree that reality can be argued. Two people can see the same event and come out of there with very different interpretations of what happened. For that reason, I don't have a lot of interest in US History books. Or any history books. They include boring details and rarely list the ""why"" of what happened. And I'm sure the ""why"" is likely interpreted incorrectly a lot of the time. 7. With that said, I'm not well versed in history as it is recorded. I paid attention in school enough to pass tests without much interest in history much past that. I had a teacher or two who got me interested in it more for a season, but it doesn't seem to last. Textbooks are too dry, and an individuals diary, though personal, seem rare and often dry with only a tiny fragment of helpful information concerning a major historical event.What I'm trying to get at, is that because I'm not well versed in history, I realize I may very well have missed the major points of this book. I feel that he was probably pointing to something specific with each unusual detail. ------------------------8. 'They were content with life because they had nothing to compare it to.' I don't think that would hold water. I think everyone dreams of better even if they see no possibility of better. And if a party existed that sucked the happiness out of your life, there would be a higher percentage of committing suicide long before the thought police noticed them. George Orwell assumes that a desire to live will keep a person alive through torture and it won't. Prisoners will just refuse to eat. Refuse to even get up to use the bathroom facility. Refuse to heal. If they have no one and nothing to live for, they will fail to thrive. People are very resilient but most are not as resilient as that. Death would appear to be a relief in this life... as it currently does to the people of Gaza this week. A country that is caught between the war of Israel and Palestine with thousands of casualties every week. One man on The Nightly News says, ""A thousand die yesterday and a thousand tomorrow. Who cares? Anything would be better than here."" (Abt. 1 august 2014). 9. The parole's have the best life. They get to have family. They get to sing. They get to do rewarding work like raising children. They have privacy. The party members simply spend hours and years fabricating and re-fabricating history books that no one reads or cares to look up. Paroles get to have a soul. They get to love. They likely would not revolt because their life isn't as bad as a person in the inner or outer party. Though food may always be tight, they will always have a family to live for. And there's a decent chance they are keenly aware of what's going on externally, or at least some of them, but it isn't really bothering them enough to do something as drastic as a revolt. 10. Power. I really don't understand this conquest. I read a personality book once (The Color Code) that stated one of the 4 personalities is interested in power and in being respected. But unfortunately ""pure power"" as history has shown over and over again seems to corrupt the man holding it and turn him into a devil. It seems to have done that in this book. 11. ""A utopian society is impossible. There must be a high, medium and low class."" I think that's Bologna. I think that utopian societies have existed in history but that they are rare because every person in the society has to become kind, thoughtful, full of love, selfless, and peacekeeping in order for that society to work. In the last many centuries, selfishness is everywhere. Hate is everywhere. It couldn't be achieved in this decade because you couldn't make all the selfless people in the world live in the same town together. They've got jobs and people they love and a place they call home. They wouldn't come. It's not until an entire town, or nation or country and every individual within it strives to become good and selfless and loving that it could possibly be achieved. In this book, each individual, particularly in the inner and outer parties, are becoming liars, bigots, adulterers, spies, jerks, two-faced, and prideful. That's why it is a dystopia. It's not the party. It's the individuals who are being cruel to everyone around them. A ""party"" is just a group of organized people with presumably the same theological beliefs. The people are the ones who are the cruel perpetuators of this dystopia. 12. If there's any character I relate to the most, it's probably the mothers who look at their children with fear that they may become a nasty product of their environment: a careless creature who will turn their own parents in. Sometimes I worry about this for my child(ren). I want my children to see through the lies they see on TV. To know that KFC doesn't taste as good as the commercial depicts it. That beer and cigarettes will kill you later and hurt you now - more than just physically. To know that seat belts are life saving and are not an embarrassing thing to wear. To know that the rich are not evil sorcerers and the poor aren't savages. They are all people just like us who struggle to deal with their own life challenges. Not to say there aren't any evil people. I'm just not sure I've met any truly evil person. I've met a few with evil intentions. I don't think that's anywhere near the same thing. Which reminds me, I don't think ""ungood"" means bad. Because there are times I describe something as not good and not bad. It just is. Or it's both. and Neither. Or perhaps it's goodness or badness is basically unknown. And I don't think Ingsoc could succeed in changing the language entirely. People would just create a new word for the expression they are trying to portray. Just because there is no word for Angry, doesn't mean you don't feel it. It just means it's harder for you to identify that feeling until you give it a name. ",Keshia

2,1602,1602,,"This is one of those books that I had always meant to read, but never got around to. Finally, one of my Plymouth High School classes required it, so I was happy to pick it up, though not without some reserved skepticism beforehand. I knew it was one of those books that is constantly referred to by people who are paranoid about government and distrust everything the government does, which wouldn't really describe me, lol.. But, I have to admit that Orwell's writing is masterful. I did not see any similarities in that world, to ours. That was like a dictatorship. They were evil. It was a pessimistic, dark and depressing story. I was kind of haunted through out the novel by feelings of anger, upset and pity. The shocking cruelties and oppressions, of a totalitarian government and its terrifying possibilities. The emptiness of the evil party ,that rules with an iron hand. They to me were bad people, and their lust for power.... Was crazy. The mind control and brain washing , cruelty and brutality could sentence people to agree with me. And also the torture or death was a climate of fear. Even violence and control is was everywhere in this book.  Defiantly not my favorite, but exciting at the same time. It a great depressing story.

2,1604,1604,,"< I'm sorry for minor spoilers, I'm writing on my phone and it's not very comfortable> it was probably very good deep book but for me it was sick. it was written great, using the ""new language"" (don't know how its called I was reading polish translation) helped feel into the reality; dividing into 3 parts made perfect sense. about the story... it was so weird. first part was the Introduction to the world that is so fucked up it's hard to believe it could ever happen. second part was the Love Story, I liked it but in their love was something fake, too much thinking, forcing. and the third part the Brainwash. a bit disgusting, terrible, scary. here, too, I'm not sure if I believe it. that is no discovery that tortures influence people, make them say, do, maybe even think(?) things they wouldn't otherwise. but there are other stories, books in which people are strong, become heroes because they stay true, don't break under tortures, like some of the books about World War II (for example 'Stones for the Rampart: The story of two lads in the Polish underground movemen' but it's typically polish book so no one probably knows it).

2,1616,1616,,"For a long time I was curious about this book. What kept me from opening it was the dark dystopian world in it. How can that be fun or interesting? Seeing so many positive reviews here on goodreads changed my mind. I opened the first page and started reading. And so unfolded a future England, part of a territory called Oceania, in a state of permanent war, poor and totally decrepit. And above all, ruled by a totalitarian government that calls itself Big Brother, a total, total control freak. Masses are kept dumb under a blanket of propaganda. Secret police hunt down dissidents relentlessly. Kids grow up indoctrinated by Big Brothers propaganda. So far. These were the reasons that I was not interested in 1984. Because there are too many unpleasant realworld places like it. Even in this century. Sadams' Iraq had 4 secret police organisations, every one spying on the people and also spying on the other 3. Many people dissapeared. Torture was the norm. Another example is North Korea with its fascinating propaganda that makes you believe it is heaven on earth. I kept reading. Winston, the main character, grew on me. It was interesting to see how he coped, or not, with the mind control by Big Brother. His mind rebelled. Then came the point when he admits this to a high party official. And at first, it looks like they are all part of the opposition to the regime. At this point, I imagined a story-line where Winston would be enrolled in a revolution, sacrifices everything, that the party official too wanted to start a coup d'etat or revolution and bring down Big Brother. Only to discover that the new bosses are no different from the old ones. But I saw that the remaining pages were too few to allow for that to unfold. So I expected Winston to be double crossed instead. That would fit. And so it happened. I enjoyed emersing me in the dystopian world of the book. Watching the movie 1984 of course. Watched some tourist youtubes on North Korea. Then a surprising thing happened. In the back of a video of the capital Pyonyang I saw the grey misty shape of a huge pyramid shaped building rising high. Huh? A ministry building á la 1984? Nope, at closer look it is a monstrous 105 level super hotel. Construction started in 1987 and only now in 2012 it is close to being finished. Don't believe me? Just google for ""Ryugyong hotel"" or Hotel of Doom. Amazing. By now the story about Winston was halfway and came to an abrupt disconnect because Orwell had Winston read a manifesto by the fictional enemy of Big Brother. An opponent called Goldstein. Orwell seems fierce about this manifesto and goes on and on about it, repeating over and over again how keeping a permanent war up and dumbing people with propaganda is the means for a ruling clique to hold on to power and privilege. Is this why Orwell wrote it in the first place? This part of the book was too long and boring for me, I stopped reading for a week. And the manifesto was wrong. Oversimplified and incomplete. I must say that a state like Oceania will loose a war because its economy cannot support it. Dumb and poor citizens dying on the battlefield or by thought-police do not produce innovations or much resources. I read on to see Winston captured, tortured, body and mind destroyed. A dissapointing end to a story that amounts to a frightening warning against totalitarian regimes. What inspired Orwell to write this book? Does anybody know?",Maurice

2,1661,1661,,I really didn't enjoy this book. It was very boring in the beginning and I really wasn't interested until part three. Overall the book was okay but I feel It could've been more appealing in the beginning.,Briana Webb
2,1662,1662,,"1984 presents many great questions as to the direction in which America (and the world in general) is moving, and it is shocking to realize how many of his prophecies reflect the modern age. Despite this fact, the novel was quite dry in my opinion. A novel doesn't need to be boring to propose an important warning, and it is more effective when it also captures the reader's attention.

2,1666,1666,,"spoilers warning, if you haven't read it.Very interesting, but I was expecting more. The book is pretty sexist (even going so far as to have the main character wanting to rape and murder his later love interest), the villains were one dimensional (no depth or reason for their awful actions), and the main character was not unlikable. The theme was well thought out and are certainly good for contemplating, but it seems fairly unbelievable to me. I wanted more explanation for why the party leaders felt the way they did; I wanted the reason for the madness, but I never got one. I understand that people sometimes do awful things, and there are some people that do awful things for little reason, but I don't believe there would be a complete revolution and power take-over for virtually no reason at all. That doesn't sit well with me as it disagrees with most of my experience. I did, on the other hand, find the rules that he laid out for the society interesting. He painstakingly described the language and the thought process one had to follow. I very much think that Orwell was much akin to Winston in that he understood HOW it could all be done, but could not quite explain why.",Molly Pearman
2,1667,1667,,"At first I thought this book would be inspiring and hopeful - a story of revolution. In the end, 1984 turned out to be the most depressing and frustrating novel I've ever read.The plot was okay, but the characters - no depth or growth at all. They were supposed to be different, they were supposed to change something, but they didn't. I personally don't like novels, which have no hope at all, and 1984 was one of them. The reader's hope for a better society was crushed, just as Wilson's spirit.I personally don't like this book, but I understand why many others would like it - I'm just too optimistic and hopeful to be satisfied by such a depressing book.",Maria Kärjä

2,1674,1674,,The book 1984 by George Orwell didn’t particularly spark much interest to me. I did however think that it was weird how everything you did was being monitored by the state. Also the fact that you had no one on your side surprised me. Your own children will give you up to the authorities if it means that they will be safer a little while longer. You aren’t even allowed to express yourself which I think is horrible because our parents now tell us to always be yourself. In this utopia however individualism is was a crime. What I also thought was interesting was the state was manipulating the history and was brainwashing a mass of people. Also the fact that there was an endless war to keep the population where the state wanted it. The people living in this utopia had to accept the fact that “War Is Peace” because that is what they have been told ever since they were little. Personally this book gave me a view of what our society could turn into if we let it. I would hate to live in this utopian society because you aren’t allowed to be yourself. Overall it was a good book but I would only recommend it to someone who likes to read books about utopian societies. ,Aleeka Gentzler
2,1675,1675,,"SUPER creepy. Futuristic oppressive utopian society ughhh... I did like the book but when I go back and think about it, it bothered me a bit. Mainly it was the fan base of the book that got to me; it was a good read... but not the best book out there.",Kimei

2,1677,1677,,"So, I decided to give this book a try because I was told it is similar to The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. So when I saw it available for audio via the library I decided to listen to it. I don't think now after listening to it that I would have been able to finish the book had I read it. Even so, listening to the torture scene towards the end was brutal! Being written in the 1950's (1949?), I think the book translates well into modern times. I have to say I was irritated with the main characters obvious depressing outlook on his survival against big brother. (In relation, I like the small aspect of hope and rebellion in The Hunger Games versus this book).I am glad that I was able to ""read"" this classic and I would recommend it to anyone as a one time read because if anything, it does open your mind up as to how incredibly HORRIBLE that society (oligarchical) would be. I think this book being read back in the 50-60's would have been seen even more scary with WWII being in the minds of people even more apparently than it would be in ours today.",Lani
2,1681,1681,,"Like many other classics that I haven't rated highly, the low rating is purely based on the scared-the-carp*-out-of-me factor. This book definitely deserves to be the classic it is, but it made me very anxious, even though I did read it for the first time post-1984 and should have breathed a sigh of relief...I also read it when I was much younger and felt that anything that didn't end relatively happily was unnecessarily depressing and a waste of time. I guess this deserves a second reading.*My daughter objected to my original phraseology. :)",Kristen Lumsden

2,1702,1702,,"I did not enjoy this book at all! The ending was the worst! The book was totally going a certain way and the George Orwell decides that the ending should just completely change! Winston Smith the major character of the book decides he wants to just rebel against this completely crazy world that's going on. He seems to be the only one who's in his right mind out of all this. Winston works for the outer party in the ministry of Truth, he still believed everything their leader ,""Big Brother"" and the party , stood for was wrong EXCEPT FOR what he did! He thought what he did was completely acceptable! To me Winston could have totally been just a very huge HYPOCRITE!He afterwards falls in love with another rebel (Julia) of ""Big Brother"" and together they decide that they should totally rebel against the party. After sometime of them rebelling together they both get caught. TWO PEOPLE WHO CLAM TO HAVE LOVED EACH OTHER just gave each other in! EACH BLAMED THE OTHER FOR THE CRIME COMMITTED BY BOTH! At some point later Winston discovers this whole truth of his society and then changes! HE DOESN'T REBEL ANYMORE HE JUST GIVES UP! Honestly I thought the first two parts of this book were great! You expect to see this very epic fight at the end to see if all those who are against the party to win and change things but, NO that's not at all the case ! Everything continues just as if nothing happened. I got my hopes up on the book and to me the ending really killed it for me.",Olga Castro

2,1714,1714,,"	I read this book for a monthly high school book report. Each student chooses a book and writes a review, according to certain guidelines, for each book. I chose 1984 because it seemed like a ""classic"" that would be decently interesting.I was wrong.	This book is a classic example of a classical book that is said to be enjoyed by people of all ages, that is truthfully a pain to read, at least to me and most others my age. Perhaps it's that we're young, I don't know. But this book became a chore to read, despite me choosing to read it. This review was actually due yesterday, but became too tedious to finish and write a review.	The main character is one designed for you to feel pity and empathy for, but all I felt was disgust and annoyance. He had virtually no redeeming quality, except for a rebellious and aware spirit. I was left after reading the book with a feeling of indifference, not caring what had happened to him.	What happened to him wasn't much. I don't put spoilers in these reviews, but if I did, I wouldn't click the spoilers option, because a book needs a plot to be able to be spoiled. The book is so predictable that the main character predicts what will happen to himself from the beginning of the story.	At least I now can fully understand the pop culture references to this book. If I were you reading this review, then don't read the book. Just read a more formal review that discusses themes and ideals, and skip this ""book"" that felt like a lecture.	WARNING:	THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS ""SPOILERS"" AND IS 	UNRELATED TO THE REST OF MY REVIEW**Even though without a plot a book can't have any spoilers.And the assignment part:2) I wonder what was Julia was threatened with that caused her to betray Winston3) I was reminded of The Matrix and Plato's The Allegory of the Cave during Winston's discussion with O'Brien of what is truly real, what exists, and how we can prove that it exists.9) The central issues are the debate between freedom and safety, of privacy versus protection and the general welfare.11) If the Brotherhood really existed and was addressed more extensively, then perhaps the story would have been better.13) Although it seems that Winston is correct in his aspirations to defy Big Brother, could it be that the Party, by controlling the people and keeping ""war,"" that it is benefiting the people?",Ryan Talbot
2,1715,1715,,"Ojalá me hubiese leído este libro sin ser un trabajo para el instituto. Buena idea, pero mal elaborada. Odio que un autor necesite llenar sus páginas con aportaciones que son insignificantes, y Orwell ha pecado de esto. ",Alboroto
2,1717,1717,,"So this was one of those books that I felt I should read and apart from the slogan ""big brother is watching you"" I didn't really know a lot about the book.The first thing that struck me was how that even though this book was written in 1949 it could have been written today. in a way it's timeless.The first part of the book took you through the day to day life of Winston, how the people of that time lived the lack of privacy and how the Party controlled every aspect of their life. This I found interesting. The real story began with the meeting of Julia, and the pace picked up briefly, but only briefly. At one point in the story Winston received a book. which he read 2 chapters of...and so do you. This book didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know from what I had read so far. There were pages and pages of it and it was completely unnecessary, it was like reading a text book, my mind wondered, a lot. I also find the end a bit unsatisfactory, it fact I think I found the whole book a but unsatisfactory. With this world that had been created it could have been taken a lot further... or maybe I just completely missed the point.

2,1726,1726,,"The dystopian novel by George Orwell, 1984, was written in the mid 1940s and takes place in a time where there is a totalitarian government called the Party. The world has been separated into 3 separate states: Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia, which are constantly at war with one another, and none of the civilians really know what goes on in this warfare. The Party forces a slogan on the people that says: war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength. The people have also have been separated into 3 main social classes. There are those in the Inner Party, who are the most privileged, those in the Outer Party, who have a considerably less amount of advantages, and there are the proles, the poorest people with the worst jobs. To some, proles are not even considered to be human beings. Throughout 1984, the government watches everybody closely 24 hours a day, every day. They do this by watching them through telescreens, which are TV-like mechanisms that citizens can never turn off. The ruling figure of Oceania is Big Brother, a man displayed on posters and through propaganda. Every where a person looks, they see Big Brother’s face, and that is how they know they are being watched. The goal of the Party is wipe out freedom of thought. One of the ways they do this is by enforcing the language called Newspeak on the people. The Newspeak dictionary gets smaller year by year, as they eliminate words and grammar rules seen as unnecessary. The hope is that by eliminating words, the government can also narrow the range of thought among citizens, ensuring their obedience. They also want to make sure that everybody worships the government and Big Brother, and that they really mean it, not that they just do it to avoid punishment. In fact, the worst crime a person can commit is called thoughtcrime, the crime of thinking against the government. Those who commit this fatal crime are arrested by the Thought Police, and may be tortured into thinking correctly, executed, or vaporized, meaning every record of them disappears with them, and it’s as if they never existed.	The name of the protagonist is Winston Smith, a man who lives in London, which in this time is part of Oceania. Winston is a member of the Outer Party, works for a part of the government called the Ministry of Truth, and secretly disagrees with what the government does. To relieve his stress, he begins a diary and writes down his own strong thoughts about the Party. He knows that this counts as thoughtcrime and that he has been doomed as soon as he begins the diary. One of the reasons Winston does not like the government is because they do not allow people to have romantic relationships with one another. He shows this resent by what he says about Julia, a young woman who also works for the Ministry of Truth whom he secretly finds attractive, but dislikes because he can’t be with her. Winston also mentioned that he worried that Julia would turn him in for thoughtcrime. An event between these two characters that is likely to enchant most readers is when Julia writes Winston a note to tell him how she feels about him, saying that she loves him. What the note says is surprising itself, as well as the fact that Julia could not speak these words without breaking a law. The following events lead to Winston trying to be with her without getting caught and arrested by the Thought Police. 	I thought that 1984 was a rather deep, complex book. It had a fair amount of symbolism, and there were some parts that I had to read more than once to fully be able to understand and picture in my mind. However, there were several events that did intrigue me that I found entertaining, as well as some of the decisions made by a few of the characters. Speaking of which, I really did not like the ending. I found it horrifically disappointing, and, when I finished, I closed the book feeling depressed inside. I may go reread the most interesting events for pleasure, but most likely not the whole book. In addition, I found it tricky to determine the theme of this story. After thinking about it, I think the message is that people can be broken down and brainwashed eventually if enough persistent efforts are put into it. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories of corrupt governments and dystopias. Also, I think that people interested in stories of individuals who struggle with internal conflicts would also enjoy this [and external conflicts of course (mainly man vs. society). I know there’s a great deal of that in 1984]. If you are one who is not at all interested in dystopias, or if you are counting on a happy ending with every book you read, then I would not recommend 1984 for you. ",Martha Woodside
2,1728,1728,,"bleak, dismal and utterly depressing. Yes, I take Orwell's point about the future society might have headed. I honestly think he is dead wrong. I don't think we are losing ourselves to our idols and i completely disagree. You can be in that moment of paralyzing fear and not betray your loved one. Maybe these characters couldn't but there are those in humanity who could. I like to think I would be one of them. Suffering has ever been part of mortality and it does not un-equivically lead to primitive, selfish, self-protection at all costs. I have a higher view of humanity than Orwell.

2,1760,1760,,"This book freaked me out a little bit. It seemed so unrealistic that it was hard to get into at first and therefore went rather slowly for me. This book really makes you question what the role in government is supposed to be and what would have to happen for our government to become like that. It wasn't until the end of the book when Orwell started describing different types of tortures and Smith's attempt to fight back despite that that I realized that this book really is about what it means to stay human, about what length's your willing to go to cling to your humanity. The depressing part is is that in the end, under these circumstances, the answer is that it is impossible to stay human, under these circumstances people become mindless zombies, living in their own created reality, unwilling or unable to see the truth. This is a book where the main character lost, and by the end he had forgotten what he was even fighting for, by the end he was so far gone that he didn't even realize what he'd lost. The author wrote this book as a warning. This book came out just after World War II ended and there had been several extreme governments at the time. Orwell was trying to tell us what would happen if life continued this way, if people didn't start to change. Orwell underlined his point by making everything so extreme and yet at the same point plausible enough to be frightening. This book was written at a time when the future was uncertain and the immediate past was full of horrors, in this book, Orwell was trying to protect the future by warning people away from a totalitarian existence.

2,1767,1767,,"This being 2012, one wonders why I would choose to read ""1984"" now, it being a futuristic novel about a time that has come and gone without seeming very, well..., futuristic. Good question, but one without a very good answer. It was written before I was born so I missed whatever hoopla might have surrounded its release. In the 60's when I was in High School, it was still being talked about, but by then 1984 wasn't far enough in the future to grab my interest. Then the actual year 1984 went by and I forgot the book existed. Two years ago when I began this blog, I started seeing it mentioned again, that and dozens of other titles I thought I should have read a long time ago but never did. So I made a list - a list of books I feel bad about never having read and I've set myself the task of finishing the list before I ""shuffle off this mortal coil"". We'll see.So here I am with a beat-up paperback copy of ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" in my hand. I've read it and found it fairly interesting. Some of it seems ridiculous and over-the-top, but other parts touched a nerve and were too familiar in their portrayal of how government takes control, with hardly an opposing voice, over everything we do.The main character is Winston Smith. He works for the ""Ministry of Truth"", where truth is defined by the government , and changes according to what they want you to believe today. Winston works with many others ""in 3000 rooms above ground"" continually rewriting history so that it says what ""The Party"" wants it to say.His life, and everyone else's is monitored with telescreens and microphones and the ""Thought Police"". Everything he does, everywhere he goes, who he speaks to and what he says is all known as soon as he does it. He has lived this way long enough to be fully indoctrinated into accepting that this is how it must be, that there is no way to change it, and yet he secretly wonders what life was like before it was like this. He sometimes has flashes of memory - of faces, sounds and smells from another way of life. He's curious, a seriously dangerous state to be in.In the midst of his drab existence an unheard of thing happens. A young woman slips a note to him that says simply ""I love you."" The remainder of the story is about how he responds, how they together try to live life out of ""The Party's"" reach, and how that works out for them. This book fits into the category that is now called ""dystopian"", so I don't think I'll be spoiling it for anybody when I say to not expect any happy endings.All in all I'm glad I read it. There are endless references to it in other books that I'll be able to appreciate now, and I get to cross it off my ""guilt list"". I can't say I liked it; it's dark and serious and horrifying. I do think it's worth reading though, even if you read it as I did - hoping it would soon be over so it would stop making me so uncomfortable. No pain, no gain, I guess, and I find myself a little more aware and a little more protective of the freedoms I enjoy than I was before ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"". ",Dianne

I think I recall liking it.Oh, man did I mostly not like it this time. I am astounded that they are still making kids read it. But they are. The 6 copies at my branch library were kept in a special area for books that are often requested for class reading for teens.It was hard enough for me to think about how all the astonishing stuff at the beginning was actually astonishing in 1932-like oral contraceptives, and helicopters, and the whole concept of test tube babies-let alone asking a bunch of teenagers to do that.Very uneven. Very glib at some points and overserious at others. And I don’t get how this kid raised on a reservation becomes a self-flagilating Christian by the end. HUH??? Where’d he get these self-loathing ideas…very thin basis for that in the early story of the Savage.[EDIT: In IM conversation with TorontoMeridith, the person who suggested we read this book, I actually wasn’t quite so mean about it:I suppose that the techno wonders would have been really something in the ‘30s. Helicopters, test tube babies…even oral contraceptives, which weren’t in use until the mid-sixties, I think. And he did sort of get that reducing or eliminating the physical consequences of sex (pregnancy and disease) would deeply change our attitudes.People tried to be cavalier about sex in the late sixties, early seventies, but I think for a lot of them it caused some emotional fallout because they were, after all, raised with a different morality.]She’s clearly a good influence on me.",Sundry

Here's what I wrote on BookCrossing:Well, I did read it for book club, and sadly it was quite a while ago so I'm trying to remember enough about it to write a review. The biggest thing I remember is that I was pretty ""meh"" on it. It did create some good discussions at BBC, and we all did a lot of wondering on it. What if it were written today? What if it were updated for today? What was the point of the Che Guevara-type character? Why was the book (The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism) reprinted in the middle of the book?

2,1872,1872,,"	1984 is a novel about life in a dystopia, Winston Smith lives in a world where the government is in control of everything, every aspect of life. The government/ the inner party limits the knowledge of ones’ mind, they are assigned to different positions in society. Winston is part of the outer party, he works for the government, he rewrites history. But Winston isn’t like all the other members in society; he doesn’t like being censored form the truth. He is determined to find out the truth, was life better before or after the war. The government claims that people are now living in much better conditions than the past, but there’s no proof of that since history was rewritten by the government. Winston believes there’s a group called the Brotherhood, people like him that is secretly against the government. He finds out there is such thing and he joins thinking he can change the way people are living now and make it better.	Winston meets a woman, Julia who thinks having sex is a way of rebelling against the government. Because of this, Julia and Winston has something in common, they want to be who they are and be against the government. But they realized that betrayal always comes in play. Betrayal became an important issue in this part of the story because, when Julia and Winston were caught for having an affair, they were tortured till they pointed each other out. Torture broke their promise together and fractured their love. “‘I betrayed you,’ she said baldly. ‘I betrayed you,’ he said.” (Orwell 292) They betrayed each other to survive. ",Shibei

2,1877,1877,,"1984 is a very well-known science fiction book. It is recommended for kids ages 16 and up. I read this book when I was 16, for my English class. I really disliked the book itself. It is really well known, and the writing itself is really quite interesting, but the story line is shaky at best. The book is all about the life of a man who lives in a world where everything is controlled by the government and everyone is watched by the government. Which the book in theory sounds like an interesting concept, but it has to be executed very carefully, which is something George Orwell failed to do. But the story is what draws people in. The story is what hooks readers, but the writing itself, in my opinion is awful. The amount you could do with the concept of the story is ridiculous; I mean the possibilities really are endless. But this story just kind of falls on its face, because of the way the world itself is described. It is described relatively detailed, but in a way that is very expected. This book is predictable, which is what the letdown of it all is.",Rachel Burke

2,1891,1891,,"I thought the book was fascinating to read because of the concept: in the not so distant future the world as dissolved into 3 super powers where everybody shares the collective belief that Big Brother sells. The Party rules by making the past obsolete and making people believe the propaganda over what their own minds tell them. The book is written in an almost chilling way that makes you believe this is something that could actually happen. My biggest problem with the book is that, even though it's an interesting concept, there is a huge lack of action. The story is often Winston just talking about the Party beliefs and how he doesn't agree with it, but he can't actually say or do anything in revolt. Even when there is a little bit of action, like when Winston and Julia join the Brotherhood, it's still mostly a lot of explaining and discussing how the Party works. I felt like I was reading the ideology of a culture and honestly, there's only so much of that I can take.So, am I happy that I read the book? Yes, I am. Like I said, it proposes a very interesting idea of what happens when we as a society follow blindly that what we are told be the people in power. Will I ever read this book again?

This was one of those books that I really had to push myself to read, and I never really got into it. I don't know what I expected out of this book, but when I finished the book I felt like some storyline was lacking. Somehow it felt like too much and too little at the same time. For starters, I didn't feel a connection with either Winston or Julia, and I actually found both of them pretty annoying. The first section of the book seemed to drag on and on in excruciating detail, but once Winston meets Julia the rest of the story seems like it's just skimmed over (view spoiler)[ until he is taken to the Ministry of Love. Although I have to say that the torture scenes were very well written.  (hide spoiler)]Another thing that really bothered me about this book is that at the beginning Winston has flashbacks to his childhood with his mother and sister. I was really hoping that these memories would go somewhere but ended up just being a loose thread. Overall it just felt like George Orwell started the book with a different purpose than he ended it with. However, overall I really thought that the concept of this book was interesting, and was the reason that I chose to read this book. I don't regret reading it by any means because it really opened my eyes to the way today's society is obsessed with technology and gun control.

2,1966,1966,,"1984 by George Orwell is known as a classic. The entire novel is mostly about the author’s fear of becoming a totalitarian state, not only in the future, but also in his present day when he wrote it. He feared his country, his life, and his fellow comrades had already begun and were soon to arrive at a time that the book reflects, a time where people would believe everything they were told instead of reaching out and breaking boundaries to create and learn new things. He feared that passion would be burned out. While I think it is safe to say the central theme is about a futuristic world where Big Brother always watches you, I think the theme of love and betrayal is just as important. The novel is from the point of view of a man by the name of Winston, and he is in his late 30’s. In the narrative, it is explained that 1984 is only a rough estimate of what the year is due to the way that Big Brother distorts history and facts. Winston finds himself feeling that the world he lives in isn’t right. Things are wrong, and he want’s out of his current life. He wants to rebel against big brother, so one day he buys a journal and writes in it with an old fashioned pen and ink (which is against the law and a serious crime punishable by vaporization). He feels that just because everyone else believes one thing (or doesn’t believe) that it doesn’t mean he’s insane because “sanity is not statistical”. He eventually meets the woman he hates and wants to rape and beat because of her beauty. The novel is really bizarre about love. I’m not sure if it was simply supposed to represent how people loved in this new age, or if Orwell just had a weird understanding of the idea of love. The romance in the novel is based off of mere lust. The two have nothing in common. Julia cares nothing about overthrowing Big Brother and doesn’t think it could be done anyway. She only wants to take small chances at defying the Thought Police while knowing all the same that one day she will be caught and killed.While I don’t agree with Orwell’s idea of love in the book, the way he ended the romance was absolutely perfect. If he had only started it out in a better way that made it seem believable love, then it would have raised my enjoyment in the book.A chapter or two killed the book for me. It had all this momentum, then Orwell dumps a chapter that didn’t need to be in the book in my opinion. The chapter I refer is there to reinstate what Winston already feels and thinks, which isn’t needed for such a short novel. This small thing really bummed me out. While I’m not a huge fan of any of his works in particular, I cannot deny the fact that Orwell had a brilliant mind, and it really shows in his writing. He managed to predict a computerized society 30 years before the PC and 40 years before the ones that would show up in his novel. He also foresaw a language and intellect that would be shortened (similar to that of shorthand texting language). In the novel, Big Brother sees all and knows all. In our modern time, everything we do is monitored. If it was not for the internet, I think we would still be headed in the direction of the society in 1984. We are almost as close to that societal type that is possible. It was a very interesting novel to read about how George Orwell felt about his own time and where it was headed. While I wasn’t too enthralled about several things I have pointed out, I would say it was a good novel overall, but, in my opinion, it is highly overrated. ",Thomas Olivent

2,1988,1988,,"In today's day and age this book is nothing new but I appreciate that for a work of 1948 it was a brilliant prophecy of capitalist society. Whilst this novel lacks an interesting plot it does uncover overtly the consequences of capitalism and question what it means to be human. The poetic injustice of never being able to love another human being more than yourself left me tinged with sadness; we are but selfish animals fighting for our own survival. I am part of the outer party, cynical of the inner party and distasteful of the Proles. The discussion of why the Inner Party left the others in scarcity was interesting when applied to real world dictatorships such as Iraq. It also made me cynical of America's war on terror; Oceania bombing themselves to stay in control is resonant of this. The overt nature of Orwell's analysis left me feeling like I'd been battered by a bible over the head by a Jehovah's witness. Sometimes subtlety, and the way a plot makes you feel through feeling the character's journey, is far more successful due to the emotional reaction it elicits. Only when presented in a covert way, where the message is understood by how it makes you feel combined with what you think intellectually, is this successful as the reader internalises the view and feels ownership of it instead of passively observing Oceania's fate.

2,1989,1989,,"You can find this very cheap online because it's getting a bit old now. Contentious, if very short book. I actually found it a bit gratuitous with all the torture, particularly when there was no real catharsis at the end. Some of the ideas were catchy, and I did find myself making lots of quotes. The whole idea of gaining power by keeping the lower class down and controlling the past was definitely interesting, but it lost a bit towards the end. Aldus Huxley might be next. Three quotes:(keeping the masses in check by preventing financial equality)if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.…The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.(doublethink)To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word ’doublethink’ involved the use of doublethink.(newspeak)’Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever be needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten. Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we’re not far from that point. But the process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little smaller.",dragonhelmuk

I had already got the idea of how things were, and that was just too much of the same repetition. Granted, I ended up skimming the pages until the part was over, so there could have been something I missed. But Winston says it wasn't anything he didn't know before.

2,2004,2004,,"Too depressing. It may have served as a warning back in 1949 when it was first published, but I just couldn't get into it.A few choice points;1.pg 183 ""The so-called 'abolition of private property' which took place in the middle years of the century meant, in effect, the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before; but with this difference, that the new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals.""Orwell understood what the proponents of government intervention into economic matters don't: Property requires control and, you can either have individual property rights (with decentralized control of material goods based on an understanding of justice that includes: ""you own what you earn--no more, no less"") OR you can have centralized control of property by a privileged elite. There is no such thing as ""public ownership"" where property can serve the needs and desires of the whole group. Properly defined and protected property rights allows individuals the greatest control over their lives. Public ownership of property makes the individual the tool of the powerful few who control the community.2. pg 222 ""Only the disciplined mind can see reality, Winston. You believe that reality is something objective, external, existing in its own right. You believe that the nature of reality is self-evident...But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external. reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual mind...only in the mind of the Party.""This story aptly illustrates that control over individuals has to begin by cutting their minds off from reality. This is happening today, only instead of Big Brother, it is the schools and universities which are doing this through inculcating youth with the mind-destroying ideas of Kant. Undermine the individual's confidence in his own mind, and the only alternative is to depend on the ""consensus"" of the masses --which really means the proclamations of the experts and the elite.3.pg 234 ""The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power...We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end...The object of power is power.""These three quotes made the book worth reading for me. I wish more people in this country understood them.",Beth Haynes

2,2037,2037,,"Man, what am I supposed to add to the thousands of reviews about this book that already populate the internet? I started and stopped this book twice over the last three years before I powered through this time. Even after finishing, I really can’t blame my past-self for getting fifty pages in and then saying I’d rather be reading something else. 1984 sorta lumps in with other, similar books that are more essay than novel, such as Starship Troopers and Anthem, though 1984 is the most essay-oriented of them all. I mean, the main character man actually reads from a manifesto for 30 pages! 30 pages of paragraph on paragraph that each cover multiple pages. Blech. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not knocking anyone’s premises. In fact, I agree with just about all of the ideas presented, but, dudes, come on, can we not create a real and engaging plot to go along with all of y’all’s theories about life? Especially when your ideas are so good! As I was reading along in 1984, I alternated between thinking to myself, “Yeah, right on! Stick it in your eye, Big Brother!” and falling asleep. This is not to say that George Orwell can’t write an engaging plot; the last third of the book, the torture scenes are very engaging, and brutal, even by today’s standards. I can’t imagine what people reading this book in the 50’s thought. Having said all that, just like everyone else says, the book is a long laundry list of all the scary crap perpetrated by today’s government, media, social institutions, etc. Yeah, I’m not a black-helicopter kind of guy, but this book makes me glad to live removed from most of the rest of society. Y’all can keep your claws from my home and my brain, thank you very much. Side Note: The Appendix really shows how much thought Orwell put into his language of Newspeak. The grammar and structure is really interesting, but the philosophy behind the purpose of Newspeak is shocking when one considers the political correctness pushed into our lives. Side Note #2: Hey, Signet, get a new essay for your Afterward! Erich Fromm’s essay on the dangers of nuclear war might have seemed apropos in 1961 when it was written, but it seems like small potatoes compared to what’s been going on in the last ten years.

The word IGNORANCE has a negative connotation and the author is transparently tripping to sway us against The Party. Stop. I can think for myself. I don't need a naked label like ""2MinutesHate"" to know something's rotten. It would've been more ""believable"" for The Party to say ""Acceptance is Truth"" instead of ""Ignorance is Strength"".

However, just because the theory, argument, basis, etc behind how and why this kind of world could develop and exist is scholarly and thought out doesn't mean that it holds any validity. The world outlined is disturbing, but it is not haunting because it is ridiculous to think it would/could ever happen. The authors voice, to me, had a tone of preaching. Like he is saying ""I am smart. I am intellectual. I have deep thoughts. Those in power are trying to tell us what to think and manipulate us into thinking like they want. I am going to warn you where society is headed. Listen to me."" So many people think this book is, as they put it, ""important"". Even many of the reviewers who didn't like the book still pay some level of homage to the message. Like saying the message is really not that important is akin to admitting that you are not smart or don't ""get it"". I get the sense that many of the people who think the message is so important and identify so strongly with the book are those who either have a distrust and fear of the government, don't feel in control of their own lives and fear being constantly manipulated, or who want to use the idea of fighting against Big Brother to justify their own extreme beliefs or actions.

Maybe it's just me, but that is honestly how it came off.I often see people state ""Orwellian"" about one thing or another, overlooking that their own views are, in fact, more in line with Big Brother and the Thought Police, than the people or organization they chastise with the term. Maybe the term doesn't mean to reference the book in any way, but surely those who make statements that ""this is some 1984 type shit"" and turn around and talk about banning words, or other such things, hasn't read the book. I'll move on from that point.It was all right, I guess. In my opinion, it's not aged well. Sure, I can see how it was once a book that did something that others hadn't at the time and I can respect if for that. Again, I felt like it was more to do about a man struggling with aging. There were some interesting things here and there and it cultivated some thoughtful thinking at some points--just not enough to keep me wanting more.Maybe I've taken it in at the wrong time of my life, but I just didn't care much for it. Surly saying this to someone at some point in my life will provoke a ""Big Brother has gotten to you"" type of response--but I don't care. I have the freedom to not care much about a book. It has though endowed me with ammo, for which to fire back on those who tell me my views are ""Orwellian"". Trust me, I could go on for hours about how I think people who use the term haven't even read the book.Give it a read, or don't--it's up to you.",David Maynard

2,2106,2106,,"It was great in theory, but sometimes hard to follow so it was difficult to read.",Caish
2,2107,2107,,"Society created by Orwell is really new and interesting. In spite of all this, I do not feel close to the main character..",Aitxo No te quiere
2,2108,2108,,"This is a great book and I think it deserves 4 stars.Anyway, this isn't my type of book and it was impossible to finish it.",Mario
2,2109,2109,,This book started out really good with a really cool concept but it failed to deliver. The ending did not leave you satisfied. I understand Orwell was making a point but he could have made the same point with a better ending.,Annie Anderson
2,2110,2110,,"I thought Animal Farm was better. Orwell's dystopia hasn't aged particularly well, and the road we would now collectively take to a dystopic future seems less riddled with dictators than it once was. I'm sure when there was a more obvious threat and totalitarians were still a fresh memory, it was scary as heck, but things just seem to get murkier over time and it's harder to imagine someone actually saying the things the villain says. I think it works better in Animal Farm because it's formatted as a parable.",7sterling
2,2111,2111,,I thought the book was only ok because I feel like the book didn't have a lot of different settings. The whole book usually only took place in the upstairs in the bed room shared by Winston and Julia and the next setting was the ministry of Love. I feel like the book had lots of long boring moments through out the book. ,Brayden Campbell
2,2115,2115,,"a good book and good ideas, but draged on about 100 pages long",Michaelh
2,2117,2117,,Orwell is a genius who writes brilliant ideas of government like a novel on sand.,Michaela
2,2122,2122,,"Big Brother is watching you!!!!!!!! Although it's way too long and can be extremely boring, it is one of the better books in the required reading lists and it is much better than ""Anthem"" by Ann Rand.",MGsays
2,2123,2123,,I guess I expected more of the book since I heard about it forever. I am glad to have read it because of the iconic lines that are used a lot today. It was weird and provided some decent discussion.,Nancy Fett
2,2124,2124,,"What can I say? I'm easily bored. I just couldn't finish it. And I already knew about all the government stuff they were talking about, so it wasn't like I learned anything from it. I'm probably going to be forced to read this at some point, in English class. But until then, I give up.",Demo
2,2125,2125,,"I knew this books's reputation, and I had a feeling that most people I talked to would love it. I won't deny that it was certainly interesting and slightly scary to think about, but I found the writing itself to be somewhat lacking. It took me a very long time to finish this book, mostly because I would get so fed up with it that I would leave to spend my time elsewhere rather than read pages and pages of what I felt was a very dry style. The story was very good, though, and the message was certainly thought-provoking. All in all, I found Margaret Atwood's ""The Handmaid's Tale"" to be a much more relevant and terrifying picture of the world's future as a utopian society.",Margaret Fisher
