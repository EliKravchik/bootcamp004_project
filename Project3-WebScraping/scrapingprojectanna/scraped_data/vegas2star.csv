"1",0,"Mike Green","Not very impressed. The writing was good but the pointless story seemed to drag. I could only take so much paranoid drug induced social commentary before I lost interest."
"4",3,"Doug May","I read this during my college days when I was an aspiriing Gonzo journailist. I can not deny Hunter is a good writer and I appreciate that he was apolitical to some extent. He was actually an old school journalist we could use more of today. I can not see him fitting into an authoritarian culture under any circumstances which accounts for his rabid anti-sovietism that I appreciate. Given that I read it more than a quarter century ago I have a hard time judging how I might appreciate the writing by my standard today, however, I imagine I would still find it entertaining but the amoral attitude toward drug use and outright cheerleading for binge drinking would make the book too offputting to waste my time today. Sorry Hunter but there are too many serious works and too little time left for a middle aged man, or anyone for that matter to waste it on frivolity. Sorry for your end as well, it is sad but the path you chose was demarked from the beginning as leading toward destruction."
"7",6,"Rob Roy","If you ever had a hankering to look into the drug culture of the early 70's, this book is for you. The real value here is the comments on the demise of the 60's counter culture, but they are often loss in drug filled prose. This is a landmark book, but one that if you miss, well, oh well."
"15",14,"Sherry","Do not see what all the hoopla is about."
"16",15,"Fergus Ross","Had its bizarre and humorous moments in a sort-of Douglas Adams/Terry Gilliam style, but there wasn't much meat to the main thesis, nor did I find the story particularly gripping. Also they take a fuck load of drugs. "
"18",17,"Missyk","One of the members of my classics book club chose this as his selection (we decided to define ""classic"" as any book we feel we should have read, or was iconic in some way.) It was kind of funny and interesting, but I'm a little nauseous from the wild, drug-addled descriptions. I think I'm a bit hungover, actually."
"21",20,"Paulo Fernando","I like Hunter's writing in general. This was overboard. I read it because the movie looked insane and I hated the film. I figured the book had to be better. There are people who connect to this kind of stuff. I wonder what life is like inside their heads. Maybe I needed drugs to get it more. "
"23",22,"Honda","Few things are more boring than listening/reading about someone else's drug trip. I dunno how this Thompson made a whole book out of this. "
"29",28,"Frank Taranto","A wild semi-factual drug trip through Las Vegas in search of the American Dream?If the author and his ""attorney"" used drugs and alcohol half as much as described in this book, he has no right to complain about the failure of the 60's counterculture. Drug use as described here is one of the reasons for it's failure to produce more change."
"35",34,"Mandee Light","2.5 stars. I enjoyed the first half of the book, but as it went on I found myself bored. I felt indifferent towards Duke and I despised Dr. Gonzo. It got to the point where I finished the book just to be done with it. I didn't care about the outcome of the main characters. If Duke was a more likeable antihero, it would have greatly changed my feelings about the book."
"39",38,"Ian Gaynor-kirk","There's no real story here, it's ok with a little humour, but I wouldn't recommend it. It didn't hold my interest nearly as much as I thought it would.Disappointed."
"42",41,"Elaine","I just can't enjoy a book where the main character revels in being a complete asshole. But at least I can say I read it."
"47",46,"Brett Myer","An interesting read, but I think you have to have lived through the 60s and 70s to truly appreciate--or even fully understand--it. "
"52",51,"Sheri","So...I saw this movie when it came out with Johnny Depp in the nineties and I was in college and it was great fun (although admitedly I was not sober and don't remember it very clearly). I had never read it, but also heard it praised as having one of the best beginnings to a novel ever.And so, I was disappointed. Certainly it is slightly entertaining and there are some funny moments. But really, it's just one rambling high. Maybe I would have liked it more if I was not sober when I read it, but I doubt this. Raoul Duke is too paranoid, flightly, and generally distracted to be much of a narrator in my opinion. Dr Gonzo (his lawyer) is just an ass and overall I wasn't really smitten by either as main characters.Raoul needs to enjoy his high or just get over it; being so concerned with ""passing"" or getting caught just didn't seem like a good way to spend his high."
"56",55,"Georgi","Филмът ми хареса много и имах високи очаквания към книгата. Уви, много се насилвах, но не издържах..."
"70",69,"Rowdy Stilwell","Good for novelty value. That's about it."
"73",72,"Tracy Morton","Hmm...I don't get it. This is just drug fueled craziness."
"74",73,"Christie","Hunter S. Thompson speaks truth. But in a mixed up way. This book is a bit scatter-brained and doesn't particularly appeal to me apart from the style it's written in."
"76",75,"Dizzyk","I thought for sure I would love this book based on reviews but for some reason it was an effort for me to read. I really tried to understand what all the hype is about but I just didn't get it. It was definitely amusing though. Maybe some day I'll try again."
"79",78,"Ren","According to Goodreads, and my personal way of rating, 2 Stars means 'it was okay'. And that is pretty much how I felt about this book. Sometimes it was funny and entertaining and surprisingly intelligent and insightful, even. But at other times it was mostly just unpleasant. I am not sure how much of the characters in the book comes from their real-life counterparts and how much is made up for entertainment value, but I truly, honestly /hated/ every single person in this book. I hated them even more after the chapter about Lucy. What they did to her honestly turned my stomach. I'm not the kind of person who doesn't like to read about criminal activity or questionable people, I just think the way this book did it wasn't for me. Especially since the narrator constantly tried to make out that none of it was his fault, really. Also I found myself constantly confused. Not because of the drugs aspect, surprisingly. I think it probably came more from me knowing nothing about the locations and not knowing all that much about the time period, in the US especially. That and the way they obtained cars, drugs, hotel rooms, none of it seemed plausible. That, again, could come from the fact that I am used to today's amount of security, but I do think that this whole book relies VERY heavily on the reader already knowing about pretty much everwhere and everything talked about. Either that, or a lot of it was actually nonsense. I also don't think I personally am a fan of Hunter S Thompson's writing style. On the whole, even though based on the premise this book sounds right up my alley, literally everything about it was just not a good fit for me. I did enjoy parts, and I do respect the fact that it probably is a good book for the right kind of reader, it just wasn't enjoyable for me."
"82",81,"Ariana Thompson","I've never been so happy to have a book end. Was the intent to make the reader feel just as tired and defeated as the Duke by the end? If so, great job. I could not take one more crazy explanation of a drug trip. "
"93",92,"Giovanni","Better than the movie, at least..."
"99",98,"Sally","It's basically about as interesting as watching other people do drugs."
"108",107,"Morgan Sohl","Read this for Book Club. Not my cup of tea but I can see how it was probably shocking and interesting when it was published.This combines many of the most boring parts of literature, drugs effects explained forever, white guy who is filled with self-important navel-gazing, and disaffected men whose lives aren't hard they are just losers.It also combines the rampant drug-use of the 1960s without any of the political passion for change of the hippies."
"115",114,"BeeQuiet","I'll freely admit, although I loved the beginning, by about half way through, I was getting bored. Yes, you do drugs, you're very cool. Get over it."
"122",121,"Kenneth Hursh","Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was about a guy who takes a lot of drugs. I knew that much going in, and it turned out that was almost all there was to it, story-wise. Hunter Thompson a/k/a Raoul Duke is supposedly a journalist covering events in Las Vegas for Rolling Stone Magazine, first a motorcycle race, then a conference of district attorneys about the growing drug culture. He attends these events with his drug supplier, known as “my attorney,” and their ensuing intoxication generates a few laughs, some embarrassing moments, and lots of paranoia. I’d call Fear and Loathing the grandfather of Jack-Ass, Borat, and their ilk. Congratulations. I’d heard Fear and Loathing was funny, but for the most part, it wasn’t. Like Cheech & Chong, drug humor may have been hilarious when it was new and edgy. Nowadays, it comes off as a lazy attempt at a laugh, kind of like yelling cuss words in a public place. Just not that funny, unless you’re stoned, maybe. "
"131",130,"Lee Belbin","Truly unbelievable narrative about Thompson and his Samoan attourny totally drugged out and crazy in Las Vegas. Never happen today!"
"132",131,"Josh Stephens","Kind of boring. I expected a lot more out of such an acclaimed book. Thompson was a really strange guy and his trip to Vegas certainly proved that."
"134",133,"Benjamin Siess","I read this sober. I think that was a bad choice."
"138",137,"Nick","Despite the idolatry that Hunter S. Thompson deserves as a counterculture icon, I found Fear and Loathing devoid of plot, planning, and poise. Is is nearly unreadable, and pretty ungratifying even if you manage to finish it. There are hundreds of iconic counterculture books where your time is better spent."
"144",143,"Trishtator","I'm not sure how to rate a book that is both crazy and sublime. Thompson's search for the American Dream is something I have pondered in our uncertain times, forty years since his own, but I think he makes some interesting statements about his journey."
"145",144,"Tomek","I loved when Thompson actually was straight for long enough to talk about something meaningful. Otherwise, this is just one long trip with one dumb, crazy experience after another. It's amusing for a while, but quickly falls flat."
"147",146,"K.D. Absolutely","Las Vegas, 1971. Rolling stone journalist Raoul Duke and his Samoan attorney Dr. Gonzo are in Las Vegas to report on Mint 400 motorcycle race. Mint 400 is an annual desert off road race for both motorcycles (up until 1997) and four-wheeled vehicles sponsored by Del Webb's Mint Hotel and the Casino. The last game happened in 2008. (Source: Wikipedia)The novel is a roman-a-clef, i.e., a true story posing as fiction so the author has more leeway to tell all. During their two trips (the book is divided into two and appeared in two installments in the magazine Rolling Stone) they are in search of the ""American Dream"" which in the story is symbolized by an old psychiatric office in Las Vegas. In reality though, as Mr. Thompson is an anti-Vietnam campaign, the ""American Dream"" is his symbol of what for him should be the ideal U.S. government particularly on its stand on Vietnam war. The 70's was said to be the Dope Decade in the U.S. I was born in the 60's and I grew up while the American bases (Subic, Angeles, etc) were still here in the Philippines. So, during those times, you would see the clubs in those areas jam packed with American G.I.s with Filipina girlfriends in tow. With them went the media taking advantage of selling all sorts of stuffs that yankees patronize. With them was prostitution. With them was our involvement (as launching pad) in the Vietnam war. With them were those pictures on the newspapers and magazines that I used to sell as a newspaper boy in the province. Have you read a book where you and the author fell like to be on the opposite sides of a pole? This book felt like that for me. I don't not have any interest on the Mint400. I don't read Rolling Stone. I don't do drugs and I am not interested on it. I don't care about car races. I am just a simple all-Filipino father who work honestly for my hard-earned money to support my family. I always try to relate to each novel I read but this one just seems to irrelevant to me except for those pictures in the newspapers I used to sell when I was a young boy. Those and nothing else.This roman-a-clef novel is loosely written. It's like reading a diary. There are some funny but could be a bit vulgar drawings. As it is loaded with drug-addict characters it also has the tone of a novel whose passages and paragraphs were written when the author was under the influence of drugs. The plot goes anywhere. Despite all these, I am not surprised to read that this became a hit in the U.S. Maybe because it mirrored a slice of American life during those year of anti-Vietnam demonstrations and with many of their people hooked on drugs."
"148",147,"Nadima El-khalafawi","I found this book annoying and was disappointed after hearing such rave reviews."
"156",155,"Thomas Rahla","At moments, this book was humorous with the drug induced reality of Thompson and his lawyer. But the reality of it is, this story had little to no plot at all. It was a quick and easy read."
"160",159,"Christine","Dont know why I kept reading this one till the end.. "
"161",160,"Jenny Yates","Although this is one of those books that insinuates itself into the culture, I hadn’t read it before. It definitely has some paragraphs that are worth reading, mainly observations on the segue between the 60s and the early 70s. There are some keen observations in quite beautiful prose, every once in a while. And the rest of it is often monotonous and occasionally funny: an account of a journalist and his attorney going to Las Vegas, driving around stoned, trashing hotel rooms, harassing people, and generally acting like idiots. It’s funny because they occasionally get away with outrageous stuff. But the metaphors are heavy-handed, and, all in all, I would say this is a comic book in prose form, directed mostly towards teenage boys. "
"162",161,"Mark Magee","Just crap, a waste of my time. Hunter S. Thompson in no way represents the generation I knew. After viewing a documentary about him in addition to reading the bookI have come to the conclusion that he was just a sad, very addicted sociopath who was just loud enough to become some sort of representative of the hippie generation. And as a writer? I've seen middle schoolers write better"
"163",162,"Ramsey Mayhew","not my genre"
"169",168,"Les Watts","I really did not enjoy the book at all. It's was boring and like watching paint dry. I wasn't at all interested in how many drugs can be taken and their effects. I didn't see the point in any of it. As far as Hunter S Thompsons writing, no opinion. I don't know what the fuss is all about."
"175",174,"Tiffany","Maybe it was because this was my first time doing an Audiobook; maybe it was because it was my first time doing an Audiobook and I didn't love the narrator's style (Ron McLarty, for any interested parties); but I didn't quite get the greatness of this novel. Beyond the Audiobook thing though, I think I'm just a bit jaded to the 'drug scene' stories. Of all people, Heath Ledger said it well about one of the films he was in, playing a junkie: ""We all know how to play a drug addict by now, it's been so well-documented."" That's kind of how I felt reading (or listening, rather) to this story. Not ever having been a drugs enthusiast myself, perhaps I can't appreciate the right-on-edness of Thompson's telling, but after having seen Requiem for a Dream, Blow, even watching fricking Dave Chapelle imitating a crackhead, it was all lost on me. I felt like I'd heard/seen it before, and so by the end, it all went a bit flat for me.But to give it its due (and explain its two stars) I DID like the whole insanity of the quest for the American dream, and the fact that it ends up (perfectly logically, in their drug-addled brains) to be a condemned building/current crack den. The portrayal of the police as hapless half-wits, ten years behind the drug scene, also seemed pretty apt. As a matter of important historical note, our hero tells us that uppers went out with Johnson and downers came in with Nixon, which I found to be an amusing sidebar. So...yeah, I guess the balance of the above is that it had its amusing moments, maybe an ACTUAL read would be better, but all in all, Fear & Loathing didn't do much for me."
"181",180,"Beckydham","Meh. Less drugs, more sadness might have changed my mind on this. I think maybe the insanity doesn't hold up or something?"
"186",185,"Olive Cortes","We get it, Hunter S. Thompson, you've done a lot of drugs and you swear like a sailor. That's basically what this book is about. I liked the pictures, that is why I am giving this 2 stars."
"189",188,"Kathleen","this book was so hard to follow. while i think the goal was to write as if you were on a huge trip, he wrote it very well. I can't imagine having your mind go a mile a minute like that. I did however watch the movie and that helped the book come together a little more for me and made it a little more enjoyable. "
"191",190,"Alex Ca","Movie was way easier"
"193",192,"Sophie Gonzales","I absolutely loved Thompson's novel, The Rum Diary (review here), so I really wanted to enjoy Fear and Loathing too. But unlike The Rum Diary, there are no surprisingly elegant descriptions. I also didn't connect at all with the characters, and their drugged-up antics became tedious by the end of the book (though they were amusing during the first fifty pages).I was very dissapointed. I know Fear and Loathing is Thompson's most celebrated novel, but I fail to see why. The Rum Diary, for a reader like me, just has so much more substance (no pun intended!) Perhaps it's the sheer, unbelieable obsurdity of Fear and Loathing that reels people in: its Gonzo style. Obviously, I just didn't get it."
"196",195,"Dayna","I couldn't finish it. I found it entertaining whenever I picked it up, but lacked to motivation to finish it."
"197",196,"Nori","A week in Las Vegas, two convertibles ruined, and all the drugs that fit in your pie-hole: Hope that sounds like a fun read, because that's pretty much the beginning and the end of ""Fear & Loathing."" Thompson delivers the occasional gem between amyls and mescaline pellets, brief moments of insight between deranged trips -- and these are the only few sentences I really liked in the book. Here's one that sums it all up: ""No doubt they all got What Was Coming To Them. All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit. But their loss and failure is ours, too. What [Tim] Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped to create ... a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody -- or at least some _force_ -- is tending that Light at the end of the tunnel.""There is no light at the end of ""Fear."" Just another trip."
"201",200,"Steffie Corcoran"," Ugh. "
"207",206,"Zheng Wei","It has been described as outrageous, brilliant and funny, but Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas reads to me less as the book that describes the drug decade and more as the ramblings of a drug-addled mind. Perhaps I am missing the point, perhaps that is all there is to it. Still, I feel shortchanged; I expected more than aimless journeys and endless paranoia, reckless intimidation and meaningingless tasks, all in an effort to get or remain high. I suppose it is a credit to Thompson's Gonzo journalism that I am unsure which part of the book is fact, which is fiction and which is fact in an acid trip."
"208",207,"Tamanna  A. Shaikh","I think I'm not the right person to be reading this book. I don't drink, haven't done drugs and haven't been to Vegas. How, for the love of God, could I possibly truly enjoy this one?It did make me laugh and was funny in its own way but for truly appreciating it, one must know ether outside of chemistry labs! "
"211",210,"Leslie Waugh","Well, I'm glad that's finally over. Didn't really get it, though there were bits of clarity. Maybe I need to read other HST works. But not anytime soon. "
"219",218,"Natalia","I hated the book, I hated the movie. This is exactly the type of book that should appeal to my nomadic, eccentric self. However, similarly to On the Road, I'm underwhelmed. Am I missing something? Am I just jaded? I truly wish I could enjoy these so called groundbreaking novels. Sigh, my heart breaks."
"228",227,"Broadsnark","I read this for my inebriation themed book club and I am already forgetting it, which doesn't say much for it. In case you are one of the five people on earth who hasn't seen the movie - Thompson goes to Vegas to cover an absurd motorcycle race through the desert while eating half blotters of acid, sniffing ether and making mildly interesting observations. Now I am trying to figure out what we are actually going to converse about at the book club. We could talk about the absurdities of Vegas, where I was for a birthday party this weekend. But it is just too easy to chew up a place where people drop tens of thousands in one night while, according to the cab driver, 86% of homeowners are underwater on their mortgages.I suppose we could talk about journalism and the illusion that anybody is ""fair and balanced"" or impartial, or why we should pretend to be. Or maybe we could talk about all the minor, and not so minor, abuses of women in the book? How about just testosterone fueled writing in general? Or what kind of world you have to grow up in to operate without the slightest consideration to how your behavior effects, or even terrorizes, other people?Somebody sell me on this book. I don't want to just have a gripe session. Help me out."
"231",230,"Val Thompson","Drugs mess up your mind. I get it, Hunter.This book has plenty of hallucinations. What it's missing is a plot."
"235",234,"Tiina","Alkukohtaus aavikolla kuvitteellisine lepakoineen on kieltämättä aika eeppinen sekä leffassa että kirjassa, mutta siihen se sitten jääkin. Siinä missä elokuva on jäänyt joka kerta kesken ajokisoihin mennessä, kirjan sain sentään pakottamalla luetuksi loppuun. Ei ollut helppoa ei, alkoi paikoitellen tuntua yhtä tuskalliselta kuin Duken ja asianajajan monipäiväiset huumekarkelot. Sitähän tämä on. Erilaisten aineiden kanssa sekoilua ja ""amerikkalaisen unelman"" metsästystä, vaikka tässä meininki muuttuu kierolla tavalla aivan päinvastaiseksi.

"237",236,"Klaudia","First and only Thompson book I've read...I thought it was boring and banal...Hard to imagine and grasp. I don't usually like debasing an author based on one work, so I'd be open to maybe reading something else. "
"239",238,"olaszka","i had high hopes for this. i'm really into new journalism and was keen to explore gonzo journalism as well. plus this was supposed to be a counter culture classic so i when i finally got my hands on it, i was buzzing with excitement. sadly, the novel turned out to be hugely underwhelming.sure, thompson can write but i was hoping there'd be some beautifully subjective journalism in gonzo journalism but i failed to find any. nor did i manage to find too many elements of the satire that everybody was talking about. the whole thing reeked of complacency and self-indulgence and struck me as a bit pointless. maybe it did have a point four decades ago but now? serious, i'm SO underwhelmed. "
"240",239,"Dennis Willingham","Continuing my re-read of some 60's and 70's books. Probably my least favorite Hunter Thompson book, I don't really buy into the fiction is truer than the true story thing and feel it pales in comparison with his reporting, like the excelent ""Strange Rumblings in Aztlan""."
"244",243,"Dezarae Dodd","Confusing so far!"
"247",246,"captain america","for one reason or another, i'd never read this except for a few rolling stone excerpts. sacrilege, i know, but i couldn't get through it. a few good observations here and there but reading about people getting fucked up doesn't entertain me anymore. "
"254",253,"Nikki","I had expected this book to invoke a strong reaction in me, be it positive or negative. To be honest though, this book mostly made me feel indifferent. I don't hate it, I wasn't as repulsed as I thought I would be, but I didn't much care for it either. I don't really understand what the big deal is."
"258",257,"Linda Franco","In spite of my familiarity with the substances of choice, I found the grandiosity of the character off putting. I had no empathy (and I have plenty of it to spare). I was annoyed at his irresponsibility. "
"259",258,"Kane S.","God forbid, I have some less than glowing things to say about Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. On the plus side it is an amazingly fast read. Thompson does say some valid things about the sadness and horrors of the post 60s Nixon era, circa 1971. (With things like 29 cent burgers in a diner!) It does capture a time and place and a culture, reeling, as I think characterized most of the 70s, from the preceding bipolar madness that was the great hippie experiment, and in the underlying nihilism of what was already an obviously corrupt and insane government as the Vietnam War dragged on after the flower children had run their course. My problem with this book is that it is pretty much Thompson's presumably largely nonfiction documentation of sickening alcoholism in addition to the wholesale consumption of a variety of hallucinogens, uppers, downers, and just about every other kind of hard drug imaginable, all the while this pair of drug fiends destroying rental cars and hotel rooms, bullying and terrorizing many who get in their path along the way. If you worship drug culture and vomitous drunkenness for their own sake, this book may be a divine guilty pleasure, as it is probably the most scintillating porn imaginable for the devout substance abuser, as well as for people who like to throw their weight around and behave like aggressive violent assholes to innocent bystanders. I hear some say that this is not Thompson's greatest work so I may give another book of his a try. For myself, I will stick to a drug that should be legal and will leave the nightmarish booze and pill driven fodder for those who appreciate it a lot more than I ever will. Drunken hallucinatory insanity and general aggressive nastiness are not my bag, no matter how bad Uncle Sam certainly is at his worst. "
"260",259,"Maeve","Not my thing. People in altered states frustrate me."
"262",261,"Leif","Not sure why this is such a popular book. Aside from it's obvious niche with those who enjoy abusing drugs (particularly psychedelics), I can't see why someone would like reading it. Yes, he was driving dangerously fast quite often while on drugs, and yes him and his 'attorney' acted like filthy animals while on drugs. Sure, he wasn't a fan of Vegas at all. He sees people in Vegas as vain, egotistical tools who look at Vegas as an outlet for their own self-centeredness. That's also nothing new to novels.The writing did has witty but I got really tired of reading about the expensive cars he was driving. I'm glad it was a short read.It seems like I'm missing something regarding WHY this is considered such a great book. "

"281",280,"Jack Bangerter","I was fully expecting a wild book about someone really breaking some rules and getting into some trouble and losing, or winning, or something. Instead (spoiler alert) nothing happens. A guy does a lot of drugs and drives around and ruins the hotel rooms, but no trouble, no nothin'..."
"282",281,"Kandice","I just finished The Rum Diary and didn't love that so goodness knows why I went ahead and read this. I ordered both from the library and I always feel this illogical guilt if I change my mind about a library book. I know there isn't a line of people waiting for the book (at least usually) but what if there is and I squandered my opportunity? O_oThis was only as entertaining as watching my drunk friends when I'm not. I can't wait to see what they will do or say next, but then when they say or do it...it's not as funny as I hoped. Sometimes it's downright sad.The attorney was a great sidekick, but I thought of the main character as the same guy in The Rum Diary so kept finding myself wondering when he would learn. They aren't the same character, so that's my fault, but I think that's why I had a hard time just tagging along for the ride."
"294",293,"Chris Brown","I would have given this 2 and a half stars is I had the option.Hunter S. Thompson is an interesting guy, and maybe this book is worth reading. But the man is really in love with the sound of his own voice. The author/protagonist has the responsibility level of a spoiled 5 year old. To the extent he makes any observations, they are through a drug filled haze and not very useful as a commentary on society. Thompson includes stories on how he fools certain people now and again with wild tales (harmless stuff), I think he believes that he really was pulling one over on people. However, my impression is that people were just humoring some drunk.In the end, we are left following the author around on some stoner binge--which quite frankly is a bit fun. Also, Thompson is a good writer and he keeps the book moving along. I can see why people would rank give this book a higher ranking than two stars, but it really didn't do much for me."

What follows is a report of the pair's misadventure as they unleash their drug-induced insanity upon maids, tourists, Mint 400 racers, car rental workers and many more. The novel purports to be a composite of fact, fiction and fantasy based on Thompson's own real-life experiences on two separate expeditions to Las Vegas. There are occassional moments of brilliance and genuine amusment in the descriptions of the protagonist's mescal and acid-induced haze, but the novel quickly descents into a rather tedious and repetitive acccount of somebody else's bender. Much is made of the 'gonzo' style of the piece, but I feel there was little novelty or inspiration in this. Maybe this is due to the fact that 'Fear and Loathing...' is before my generation, and the importance of 'gonzo' is lost on me. Additonally, I neither identify nor sympathise with whatever ideals the novel purports to champion. If anything, as the novel progressed, I came to consider the protagonists as rather annoying and shallow, and if there was some intended irony it was far too blunt for my wit. If you're into drug culture you may find something of your self in this book, if not don't waste the 3-4 hours it will take to read this book (or try instead Huxley's much more intellectual and fascinating 'The Doors of Perception')."
"306",305,"Sam","Reading about someone's drug trips is apparently only entertaining for me for the first 100 pages or so...because after that it grew repetitive and boring."
"307",306,"Jason Parra","Thompson says it best on page 180. ""Ah; this terrible gibberish."" That sums up my thoughts on this book perfectly. Page after page of juvenile idiotic behavior as well as the constant mentioning of every drug possible became quickly annoying. Given the ratings this book has received, I was expecting something great but found myself growing progressively irritated with each turning page. The two stars is only because it takes place in Las Vegas! "
"308",307,"Rumana","A subject about which I haven't really read much, this is an outrageous book. Alien, but it kept me engaged enough to persevere through it. "
"311",310,"Brett Mullane","Another book where the parts are definitely greater than the whole sum. It had some good moments and lines, but ultimately didn't hold much substance for me."
"322",321,"Nicole Burden","Nothing but a drug fuelled roadtrip to Las Vegas. Struggled to finish it."
"331",330,"Gigi","Wasn't quite what I was expecting. A bit trippy for me but after I read more about Hunter S. Thompson I could appreciate the style and writing better."
"339",338,"Joe Callingham","The death of the American dream or a crazed, drug addled man finding his American dream? A fun book for its original style of prose, I found it very difficult to form any attachment to the deranged characters."
"340",339,"Stefan Yates","Where to begin? I just finished this wild ride and I'm a bit disoriented. To be perfectly honest (and I think that my rating sums it up) I did not particularly enjoy this novel. Maybe I'm not open enough to the types of things that the protagonists get into, or maybe I'm a bit too young to get the whole gist of the early 70's drug culture, but I was mostly just lost.The storyline revolves around a journalist and his attorney and their experiences in Las Vegas covering first a road rally race, then a district attorney's conference all the while hopped up on every kind of drug imaginable.The first half of the book, they are so stoned out of their minds that most of what they see, hear and experience are just paranoid delusions that they take for reality. I found a lot of it really hard to follow and basically didn't really catch my interest.Once Part II got into swing, they've run low on some of the more potent drugs and things begin to make a little more sense, or at least are so much less confusing that I could follow what was going on.Thompson's prose are fine. I do not question his writing ability, I guess I am just not in tune with his style or at least not in this book."
"342",341,"Arjun Balaji","I feel like I'm the only one who was sorely disappointed by Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I went in with high expectations, having read bits and pieces of Hunter S. Thmpson's work (but never having read something end-to-end). I haven't seen the Depp/Gilliam film based on the book, but I probably will — visual stimulation will make the story much better.Thompson's smart — no can deny that, and cleverer than most, but the intense drug-addled writing only did so much for me. After a while, it felt like I was just banging my head against the wall. That being said, some of the dialogue and description made me laugh out loud.In the end, I felt like I was cheated of what I was promised before I read the book. I thought I'd better understand the American Dream (whatever the fuck that's supposed to mean) and I didn't feel like I got much closer.Maybe this is it, in Thompson's own perverse understanding of it. Maybe the point is that no one really knows what they're looking for and the point is to have fun and take life for a ride. The summation (and favorite bit for most people) from the book is this: ""He who makes a beast of himself, gets rid of the pain of being a man."" That felt more like a cop-out to me than to most people.I will pick up some of his other writing since I saw flashes of brilliance (which I loved) — not many writers can really make me laugh out loud. That being said, this was a tough book for me to rate, and realistically is probably around a 3.5 (rounded down to 3) "
"345",344,"Juliette","Maybe I'm missing something, but I couldn't get into this book. Too much of a nonsensical, drug induced mass. Not my thing. Maybe I'll have more sophisticated and positive thoughts after the lecture on Monday, but so far, not so good..."
"348",347,"Janessa","Despite the branding by the hip subculture of this book as a ""classic"", I actually did not like it all that much. Its one of the few times that I can say i liked the movie better and I feel that the movie pretty accurately depicts the book, so much so that an actual reading of the book is kind of unnecessary. Maybe I just had a hard time really relating to the drug-fueled paranoia. When I was finished with it I did not feel particularly enriched in anyway, but it did present moments of redeeming humor. Hunter S. Thompson is a really great humor writer, he makes me laugh. But as far as getting me really interested in the political meaning behind the druggie subculture I think he either failed or I just don’t care because my own experience doesn't allow me to. I think I like the idea of Mr. Thompson more than I actually like his work. I like the documentary they did on him and in the interviews i actually found him highly interesting as a person. I just think his work is maybe a little too hyped up and you end up with a lot of dumb kids turning him into their drug hero. I also think that the title is a little misleading. A journey to the heart of something implies gaining some kind of knowledge or understanding of that thing, but by the end I didn't feel that I had really learned anything about the heart of the American dream. But it’s a little hard to see that American dream very clearly behind the haze of so many drugs. What you get is a very distorted view, highly subjective, that doesn't really get to the heart of anything except its own paranoia."
"352",351,"Ginnie","I have to confess that this review isn't totally fair. I read this book at the wrong time in my life, and I think if I had read it at a time when my life was more like the lifestyle in the book, I would have really liked it. But, I missed my window. So, only two stars. "
"360",359,"Jude","I couldn't finish this book it was really just leading no where to me. Very drawn out but I did love the illustrations throughout the book. "
"370",369,"Jim George","I was one of those people who couldn't get into the author's style."
"376",375,"Laura Stuart","Fear and Loathing in Las Vagas gets pretty redundant after the first couple pages. They do drugs. Freak out. Other crazy things happen. Repeat as necessary. "
"379",378,"saracakes","In my opinion, this book was ultimately a few hundred pages of drug-fueled ramblings, and had no plot whatsoever. I managed to stick it out 'til the end, just to say I'd read it. I don't see why it's classed as a ""cult classic"" though.."
"384",383,"Dioscita","This thing made me ""excess sick"" just reading it."

"390",389,"Michaël Yan","To some, this book symbolises the decay of the American dream . To others, it is a guide to living life to the full extent. To others, like me, book just seems like the glorification of arrogant mischief and complete disregard for any kind of decency. Perhaps that is what the author was trying to show: the zeitgeist of the post-60's, post-idealist, post-crisis world in which we were thrown in. But seriously, Thompson was a huge dick. Though I really enjoyed Thompson's writing style, I couldn't get out of my head the fact that this book felt like an excuse to be a total asshole to everyone. "
"392",391,"Wendy Hollister","I don't know why this man became famous as his behavior is appalling."
"394",393,"Steve McKee","Bizarre"
"400",399,"Shane","I went to Vegas to do research for a story I'm working on. I thought this book might give me some insight, since Thompson went there in the book to report on a convention, like me. It turned out the book was dumb. It's just 200 pages about doing drugs, written in a way that is more annoying than interesting. "
"410",409,"Kathryn Smart","The American Dream. Horatio Alger. ""When the going gets weird the weird turn pro.""Gonzo. Journalism that reads like a novel. "
"411",410,"Wayland Smith","Not for me, this one. Heavy drug use, rampant paranoia, and generally being a dick. I just couldn't get into this one. I'm aware some folks think it's a classic, but I just didn't really get anything out of it. I'm a bit puzzled by it, honestly, as Thompson's Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail was fantastic. Oh well, nothing works for everyone. "
"412",411,"Nealhonda","I read it to say that I read it. Ok. I read it."
"424",423,"Robbie Bashore","Meh. I can appreciate that this is good writing, and I imagine it's a great portrait of the drug culture of a certain era. Having read enough of the book to get a feel for its significance in literature, I prefer to move on to other things. I definitely read enough about unstable people wielding deadly weapons to fuel my nightmares for quite some time."
"425",424,"Michael Alexander","I was going to give it a one-star, but I remember that from time to time it was at least somewhat engaging. I think this book only appeals to people interested in drugs and are too afraid to do them or are current drug users. Overall, I would not recommend this book as fun as the lizard people were hang out with."
"430",429,"Benny Jas. Baker","So easy to read - front to back cover in 7-7 1/2 hrs.... LITERALLY!"
"431",430,"Rachel McQuoid","i actually prefered the movie but this book wasnt bad. its not typically my genre of choice but im glad i read it as it was very enjoyable."
"435",434,"Ella Eli"," Although I don't consider myself a conservative reader but this was certainly not my cup of tea. I decided to change my reading habits and this time I chose to listen to an audio-book. I choose a Russian edition. The narrator was convincing and record was filled with corresponding music and sound effects that added a lot of realism to the story. Unfortunately I didn't find anything worth spending time in this story - it was full with swear, illogical, delusional, junkie addicted nightmares and a total lack of useful information. The only somehow positive thing was that amount on information given about life of heavy drug addicts - so maybe someone would read it and choose not to start take drugs because of the pathetic and totally unsympathetic condition of morals and domestic lives of people who lost control over their addiction. "
"441",440,"Ellinor","While reading this book I always thought (or hoped) that there would be a sense behind all this. The book is really famous and also on the 1001 list so I was always looking for some hidden meaning behind all this. But, well, I couldn't find any. The book is written in a quite fluent style so I read it pretty quickly. The first part still made some sense, but the second part lacked it entirely. I was only fascinated by one thing: how can anyone take that many drugs and still be able to do anything? I don't think there is any drug the two protagonists didn't take (except maybe the ones that weren't invented then). That they were still alive after their trip (I love the double meanning :) is as much of a miracle as any of the Rolling Stones still being alive today!"
"452",451,"Gavin","Okay. I'll preface this by saying I don't read books that I know I'll truly loathe, so one-star books are ones I thought were fairly bad. Fear and Loathing was just so-so in my opinion. I don't think I've ever been in a position where I can identify with Thompson's crass, drug-frenzied actions, so that was immediately lost on me. And I'll go one step further and say that I was brought up to believe that spreading ill-will and calamity is generally the wrong thing to do. So yeah, I was pretty disgusted at times at this rare display of human behavior. Like Palahniuk in Fight Club, though, the writing style made the book tolerable. Oh and all that historical drug-culture documentation, yadda yadda yadda. I'm curious to see how the movie portrays these fine gentlemen.P.S. I read the Alchemist directly after finishing F. & L. How's that for a change of pace?October 2011 UPDATE: I watched the movie, and feel like this might be one of those rare cases where one should watch the movie first before reading the book. I feel like I now ""get it"" more than I did just picking up the book with no contextual (and perhaps visual) background."
"456",455,"Darcy McLaughlin","I think that the notoriety of this book has allowed it to coast through the current generation as a ""classic"" or important read. I think that it's very limited appeal is mostly to those who are involved in drugs or find drugs cool. There's nothing really here for anyone looking for coherence or even quality writing. Sure Thompson is definitely a fired up guy, but the entire book is basically like having that one friend who's always bragging about how wasted he got last weekend. I guess it was groundbreaking at the time, but it's dated now. "
"457",456,"Cheryl","I finished it. Not a fan. It was funny at times, but it was not a book I would read again."
"459",458,"Jamie Latshaw","This is my boyfriend's all-time favorite book, so I told him I'd give it a chance...I got through it, but it wasn't something that held my interest. There was almost too much drug usage going on for me to fully understand the plot. The movie is supposed to be pretty decent, so maybe this will be the ONE time where a movie is actually better than a book..."
"460",459,"Hannah","I think it's probable that I just didn't ""get"" this book. Not one I'd read again. Maybe it's just too American for me or perhaps it's just completely outside my experience to relate to the book in any way. It was an interesting read, funny and truly horrific at points. I think it says more about me than the book itself. "
"461",460,"Jamie Logan","Overrated, but Ralph Steadman's art is fantastic and outweighs my disappointment by a mile."
"464",463,"Nicole Radcliffe","I read it primarily to see how close the movie is to the book and to get more of an insight into Hunter Thompson's personality from a pscyh prospective. The book and the movie are almost identical so both really out there and so was he. "
"478",477,"Lucy","We chose this for our 2nd book club book, and appropriately our book club for that month turned into quite a wacky night though thankfully nowhere near as wacky as anything in the book. In terms of discussion of the book however, I didn't agree with the adulation my friends had for it. Although the book tries to suggest that it's purpose is a dissection of the American Dream, it seemed to me to mainly be Hunter S. Thompson's reminiscing about the drug culture in the 60's and lamenting the fact that things have changed. And that isn't something I can really relate to. The reason I was curious to read the book was the concept of gonzo journalism that it is so famed for (as I am studying to be a journalist myself), however there was too little journalism. And too much drug taking. I knew there would be a lot of drugs but the fact that every problem they encountered only arose from their constant drug induced state was just a tedious in the end. However, the book made me laugh out load several times, and I read most of it while on trains, and it amused me that a lot of things they said reminded me of my friends (""As your attorney!""), so I don't regret reading it at all."
"484",483,"Ism","I've always found Hunter S. Thompson hard to read. Hard to follow. And a little bit hard to understand the point of. Maybe someday I'll decide it's a brilliant idea to get incredibly high, and then try to read it again. Until then, it's sitting on the shelf, waiting."
"494",493,"Roisin","A following conclusion that if you want to do drugs in America, vegas (a town that certainly never sleeps at night) is the place to be. A story about two men and their adventures on acid is somewhat perplexing and strange that one can only conclude the story to be fabricated from the twisted minds of these individuals themselves. A story that in todays world would never have seen these men leave Las Vegas after the events that unfold during their time there."
"499",498,"Christina Packard","Somebody who knows about writing knows why this book is important. I don't, but I get the story. I just don't know why I really need to read of daily living. Seemed a bit outragous? Maybe for me, but not so much for him and his attorney. So on to see what's happening in someone elses life."
"504",503,"Angel Or","i liked some of the drug induced descriptions but i found it hard to get enthralled in the novel. maybe it was just ""too deep"" for me or something..."
"507",506,"Karla","I don't understand the fascination with this book. It lacked a story, for me. It was boring and hard to get through. Some scenes were better than okay but then it just got ridiculous. I don't know..."
"519",518,"Josh King","Upon finishing this novel it is hard to understand the whole point of it. The author depicts a wild drug fuelled journey through Las Vegas, but lacks direction. Comedic at times, the journalized adventure seems fun enough, but really the book comes down to an interesting character doing stupid stuff. What would help to make the book more interesting is having an insight into Hunter S. Thompson beforehand. He was a very interesting man, and if read as almost a biography of his adventures, the book proves the be excellent at what it is trying to achieve."
"526",525,"Chris Hearn","Narrated by one arsehole, who brags about how much drugs and drink he can take over a couple days with another arsehole. Like Bukowski, Kerouac et al, this is probably great stuff if you're a young white straight guy lacking in the identity department and need some inspiration to become an arsehole. I didn't read this when I was younger, I didn't miss much. Despite being written at about a fourth grade reading level, two stars, because I probably could have picked up a much worse book at the airport. And, I'll probably read Hunter S again some other time when I fly after an all-nighter, or am in hospital, etc.."

"571",570,"Andy Dowling","'Square!' I hear you cry. Well you can call me all the geometric shapes under the sun but I'm immune to your Mr Men based abuse because the fact is I thought this book was just okay. There's a few undeniably funny set pieces and some interesting insights into America's political and social landscapes at the time; but there really is nothing worse than listening to someone regale you with tales of how WASTED they got maaaaaaan, which as far as I can see is what a lot of this book book boils down (then shoots up) to. Had I been the publisher, I would have insisted this be titled 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream (You Kinda Had To Be There)' Saying that I was utterly hooked by the attempted monkey purchase at the end, because I can relate to that in a big way. Who doesn't want a monkey for godsake? I hope there's a manuscript kicking about out there called 'Fear & Loathing On The Monkey Adoption Trail' cos I'll tell you right now, on this evidence: 5 stars. "

If you have seen the movie then you know what you will be reading, as it IS the movie...or should I say that the movie IS the book!! Which is great, being that books hardly ever resemble he movies they are made into. I would suggest reading the book first if you have yet to see the movie, it will be more of a thrill and you'll be able to create your own imagery before seeing the amazing depiction come to life on screen."
"585",584,"Lukasz Pruski","""[...] every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time - and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.""The epigraph is a fragment of the famous ""wave speech"" in Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream"" (1971). Alas, the ""wave speech"", a passage about one-and-a-half-page long, is the only thing in the novel that raises above mediocrity. About 15 years ago I watched Terry Gilliam's failure of a movie based on this book and since then I have wanted to read the original work, thinking that Mr. Gilliam - one of my favorite directors - botched the screen adaptation. Well, now I know: Mr. Gilliam did a better job than Mr. Thompson.The plot is well known, so just a brief summary: Raoul Duke, a sports magazine writer, and his attorney and sidekick, Dr. Gonzo, travel to Las Vegas to report on an off-road race for motorcycles and dune buggies, and later to write about the District Attorneys' Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. However, Mr. Duke, a self-proclaimed Doctor of Journalism, is unable to fulfill his professional duties as both he and Dr. Gonzo are permanently and massively high (so high that in real life they would end up in an ICU) on an impressive array of drugs: mescaline, LSD, cocaine, uppers, downers, raw ether, amyls, and of course gallons of tequila, rum, and beer. Oh, I forgot the pineal gland extract from a live human being. They hallucinate around the clock and use more drugs and alcohol attempting to interrupt the delirium.Clearly, Mr. Thompson wanted to write a definitive novel about the demise of the Great Dream of the Sixties and the decay of hippie culture. Yet one beautifully written passage (the above-mentioned ""wave speech"") does not redeem the whole text, whose only impact - as far as I can ascertain - is shocking and tantalizing the readers with descriptions of intense drug use and detailed depictions of hallucinations. Towards the end, there is another serious fragment in the novel, where the author probes the history and politics of the youth movement in the Sixties, until the ""orgy of violence at Altamont"" (December 1969) effectively ended the movement. The seriousness and depth of this passage is totally incongruous with the rest of the book. The ending is also strong and resonant, but all the good fragments add up to maybe five pages out of 200.One and three quarter stars."

"605",604,"Steve","I'm just amazed that, with all the infinite number of drugs taken, they did not kill themselves or other people. But all this is not the point of the book. It's really about America. It's basically saying that, if Las Vegas represents all the hidden, repressed desires of America, then indeed, America is a messed up place. Where the drugs are supposed to come in, I think, is that they were supposed to help Thompson and his lawyer achieve sort of a hyper-realized state where they could see, with crystal clarity, what this 'American Dream' was. Sort of like a microsope. What they end up doing is, tripping out on the stuff, trashing hotel rooms, causing scenes, disturbing normal folks and etc. And they get away with most, if not all of it, because that was considered semi-normal in Vegas. THEREFORE, implies Thompson, what kind of a messed up place normalizes people like him. But a critique to this book maybe, why couldn't he find out all this with out doing what he did? But I guess that's what Gonzo journalism is, putting yourself in the center of the story. "

"609",608,"Todd","I think I would have enjoyed this book more if it didn't remind me of my work so much. While reading this all I thought was yup this is how meth-heads act. The characters have pressured fast thoughts that are stupid but they think are fucking amazing. Also the parts where the characters keep referring to the fact that one of them is an attorney is really annoying and made me want to shoot myself in the face rather than listen to these drug addled crack addicts. I would recommend this book to anyone considering to be an ER nurse as this book will represent about 10% of your patient population. "
"614",613,"Cassie","I think I need to read this again to fully appreciate and understand what Thompson was trying to accomplish.

I need another go around, or maybe find some narcotics to help me through it. "

Reading the synopsis it sounded right up my alley: a journalist and his lawyer on every drug imaginable in search for the American Dream in Vegas, sounds awesome, right? Nope!I found this book sloppy, incoherent, confusing, aburpt and tedious. I still don't get exactly what this man gets paid to do because he's traveling everywhere with a lawyer to cover events, yet never writes the stories down. Also, is this a true story or loosely based because some of the things they do, especially to young women, are pretty horrid. It seemed like every chapter would start simple enough on a drug high .....and then escalate within seconds... and then their main issue would disappear, all in about 8 pages each time. It was like being on a roller coaster that shot up like Drop Zone and then proceeded with tiny stomach lurching jolts. Not fun, not interesting, not my jam. "
"644",643,"Leah T","I found it hard to read, and after a while it became very repetitive. I read it because I had heard so many good things about the movie, but wanted to read the book first. "
"648",647,"Rita Arens","Couldn't get through it. I thought the first rule of fiction was not to create an unsympathetic narrator? "
"651",650,"Barbara","I got tired of the alcohol and drug induced meanderings."
"657",656,"Ana","Yeah, yeah, I know there is a movie available based on this book. And I am tempted to say... the book and the movie are equally... good? But the truth is, if I try to remember, I don't think I've ever seen the full film. I mean, I've seen it. But for some reason I can't remember the ending, so I don't know if I've seen the full film. Although maybe it is that it doesn't have a particularly clear ending? I say it because I did read the complete book. Hmm...Well, in case you don't know, the book's about the trip of two men (the author and his ""lawyer"") to Las Vegas, in a strange exploration of drugs and... is there really another point to this book? It isn't very clear to me. Ok, I'll confess that I have the book at home, but I don't have it here, so I illegally downloaded it from the internet - and so there might be a chance that the version I have is not the real and complete version, but still... what is the point?I am sorry to admit that my experience of drugs and people who do drugs colored my experience of the book, but... well, maybe it is that I was expecting it to have some sort of revelation or something... and it mostly seems like a series of episodes without heads or tails that lead nowhere... is it that maybe that maybe that's the point? And yes, I know a lot of people won't like what I'm writing because they are great fans of the movie because Johnny Depp, or whatever... but, seriously, what is the point? (I know I've repeated this many times in these few lines, but if you're going to criticize me, it better be because you have the answer). So, I had waited so long to read it, and there's such a big hype about the movie, and all that, that in the end for me it wasn't worth it. And I actually wonder if the people who claim to love the movie don't only like it because they feel they should, you know, cause it's what is expected of us, to be cool, and all that. Or maybe I have to see it again to figure out if I've seen the ending and to see if I can finally get some clarity...Meh. "

"679",678,"Emily Mitchell","While I appreciated the flow of the writing itself and the authors unique individualistic prose I was not so enthralled with the progression of the story. The plot seemed to exist only on the minds of Duke and his attorney. The paranoia experienced by the characters simply did not transfer over to myself. Although interesting to say the least, throughout much of the book, I found myself wanting more. More conflict, more anything. I grew weary of drug addled thoughts and reference to the ""red shark"" and ""white whale."" My appreciation of the story that could have been is extensive but it just didn't translate well. It truly is beyond me how anyone could've read this and conjured up a movie out of it. In summation, the book was far too abstract for my own liking. That being said, it was still well done. The weight of the story proved to be a bit much for me but that doesn't mean that it can't be more appreciated by someone with further patience than I. "
"682",681,"Alyce","Not really my story. About a unlikable guy who takes a whole bunch of drugs the whole time."
"690",689,"Calye","It's 200 pages of a drug binge. I'm confused. How is this great literature? I kept reading hoping for more of a plot. The book did make me curious as to how it could be turned into a movie at all."
"697",696,"Danielle Porras","too...much...vomit..."
"698",697,"Richard Novak","Overrated in general?"
"700",699,"Brian LaCarrubba","I guess I missed a lot in this book. Maybe it was more about what I missed in my life, which was the wild drug experiences to relate to the frenzied stories told here. Not to say that there weren't moments of delicious irony, such as the crashing of a police convention focused on the evils of drug use. But on the whole could not find much joy in bouncing from one violent paranoid moment to the next. "
"701",700,"Dawn Wallhausen","This is sort of an iconic read, so I thought I should give it a shot. And the writing is decent. I kept thinking the same four things, though:1) How are they not dead?2) Is there ever a point where they ingest anything that's good for them (except grapefruit)?and3) Is there ever a point at which they have more blood in their veins than drugs?4) These guys are a-holes (towards women in particular, but also kind of in general). This does not make for a profound or even consistently enjoyable reading experience. I think this just wasn't really my thing."
"703",702,"Danny","One of the first novels I read and one of the few I've read more than twice.This one gets two reviews from me, my first impression and second read through 5 years ago(4&1/2 stars), and how i feel now about the book now.First i saw the film by Terry and thought little about it, it wasn't until i picked up a copy of Hunter's Kingdom of Fear that i actually wanted to get a copy of Las Vegas.Hunters style got me from page one, Duke was a blend of a younger Bryan(my step dad) with my sense of humor and at the time.... drug use. For me the book captured the crazy adventures of a couple of semi-intellects, maybe once they had great potential, following their hearts down the rabbit hole and like always, finding nothing and everything. much like myself at the time, blazing a trail like a demon but only in the wrong damn direction, destination.. self-destruction with maximum collateral damage.Now i look back, i can hardly read the damn thing. I have a seething hatred for drug use and anybody even remotely promoting the idea. Can't say i wouldn't be who i am or hold the beliefs i now do if i had never gone down that road Roul Duke took. But damage has been done, physically(I WANT THOSE BRAINCELLS BACK!) and emotionally(i thought they were friends, turns out their just vultures) and i would never want that on anyone. 2/5 - lucky your funny HST."
"704",703,"Ken Parkinson","Overrated."
"707",706,"Seth","Interesting insight into that type of world. Thought the writing was mediocre at best, and the plot seemed thin. But maybe that was the point? 2 stars instead of one for the sarcasm used, made me laugh out loud a few times."
"717",716,"Dean Brodhag","It was on my bucket list to see what all the notoriety was about Thompson's writing. After 60 pages I'd had enough to see. "

"734",733,"Stephanie Kapllani","I'm trying to branch out and read books I normally wouldn't so when I picked this up I thought I was going to hate it but surprisingly, I actually didn't. It was even really funny at some parts in a ""roll my eyes"" kind of way. However, after a while I got bored and it became a struggle to finish. Most of the time I wasn't even sure what the plot was and it was hard to understand what was actually going on through descriptions by their drugged up minds. I understand why this is an important work of literature that signifies the rising drug problem in the America in the early 60s but it just wasn't my type of book. Thompson is a good writer though. Moral of the story, don't do drugs."
"742",741,"Missy","This book is really crazy! I don't know if I would read it again, but it was fun to read once."
"743",742,"Will Biby","It's a ramble. If it stuck to its guns and kept on a path I think I would like it more. The end of part 2 feels like a complete shoehorn to make the piece more of a statement than what it is: an amusing drug-romp."
"749",748,"Kandi","I think you have to be in the mood to read this.Obviously, I wasn't because I have no feelings about what I just read..."
"750",749,"Paul Rees-jones","Self indulgent."
"754",753,"Janne Paananen","No jaah. Trippailumatkakertomus juuri niin hyvin/huonosti kuin Hunter S. Thompson sen vain osaa kertoa. Minulle hänen tyylinsä ei ole oikein koskaan uponnut. Sekavaa kerrontaa ja tajunnavirtaa höystettynä mielen sekoilulla ilman varsinaista muuta juonta kuin mennä paikkaan A ja pyrkiä sieltä hengissä takaisin paikkaan B. "
"756",755,"Collin","It's a big, long acid trip. I mean, it's not a trip to read it, it's a book about a literal acid trip (well, they take practically every drug known to man). It's ostensibly 100% autobiographical, which I find difficult to swallow. There are some parts where he goes a bit to social commentary, and I liked those sections a lot. As for the rest of it, from here on out if I want to learn what an acid trip is like I'll just take the d*** acid myself."
"757",756,"Instinct","Decent, but way over-rated. "
"758",757,"Kimberly Duncan","Kind of sickening in its gluttony. I don't get the hype."
"760",759,"Christopher Roth","I realize I'm very late to this party, but, really, I thought there would be more substance to this. Now that the memory of just how transgressive this book was when it was published has begun to fade, I'm not sure if this is really headed for any kind of pantheon. And, just so you know I'm not a hater, I thought Hell's Angels was a tremendous book. You learned something, and it had an eye-opening perspective on things. Fear and Loathing is just attitude."
"766",765,"Brandon Porter","Strange..."

"778",777,"Art","A gifted and wildly imaginative writer no doubt. Probably even a breakthrough novel for it's time. Fast forward to 2007 and many copycats and movies later, the shock is numbed and the thrill is gone. "
"787",786,"Liza","Well, I got nowhere with this book... It was due back to the library two days ago and no renewals are possible (its on reserve by some other sucker). So, back to the library it goes, unread past page 20...I really can't comment on how good or bad the book is, since I never even got around to reading it. Just never got into it. So I guess it gets 2 stars for not being ""get-into-able"". "
"789",788,"Jared Doe","When a movie can be made where there is almost no discernible difference between page and screen you either have a tremendous filmaker, or a rather average writer. In this case it's both. Hunter S Thompson is an icon. His status, I believe, is predicated on reputation alone. He is the darling of early 20s liberals. He was one of my darlings. But if you really read his work you see his desperate attempt to be a new Beat Generation man. I found his work more engaging than Kerouac. But, like Kerouac, Thompson simply fails to say anything worthwhile. The wave speech is 'the moment' for the book. To me it seems as though American literature and culture in general came crashing down post-WW2 and the nation turned completely nihilist without realizing. The speech shows this degradation so perfectly. With the most empty words Thompson can find he expresses the emptiness that defines America then, now, and for however long it takes. That's not an achievement, it's a terrible tragedy. "
"805",804,"Marija Andreeva","2.5The book gets 2.5 only because of the good writing style of the author, which makes the book easy to read. He writes well and truly represents an era. But the topic is not my cup of tea. The whole process of explanation on every single page about the use of drugs and how they work is just not my kind of literature, even if he represents that period of time truthfully, even though it is considered a classic. The whole talking about drugs and nothing else just exhausted me. "
"806",805,"Sara Wall","I can appreciate others' love for this book, but it did nothing for me. It was hard to read, hard to relate to any of the characters, and I really didn't care to hear their stories. I know it's a classic and highly regarded, but not by me! "
"818",817,"Katie Stark","Read it on the insistence of a friend. Only 2 stars but still enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to!"
"824",823,"Willbur","This book did not do much for me. I gave it two stars, because I thought it was okay, but nothing special. I can see how someone who has gone through this type of experience or likes to experiment with drugs would love this, because they would have something to relate to. But in the end, there was no real story here.. there were times when i found it entertaining, but not very often. There was no climax, which to me made the book somewhat boring. I almost felt like i developed ADD while reading this, because all I wanted to do was get it over and done with. I would find myself zoning out when H. S. Thompson would go on his rants, and those were the parts I was really interested to read about. I just couldn't get into the book.. but at least i finished it.If you are the ultimate hipster and like to be out of the ordinary I can see you loving this book. Not because it is great, but because it is something you do not read every day.By the way, I really did like his writing style. It was very fluent and easy to read, so maybe one of these days I will pick up another one of his books, but hopefully something that i can really enjoy. "
"826",825,"Mikela","Many love this book but I'm not one of them. It's not that it's particularly bad but that I just didn't find a reason to justify reading it. The whole drug scene is just so boring and I couldn't relate."
"827",826,"Jerometed","The only part of this book I remember liking, or even remember at all, was his eulogy of the American Dream at the very end of the novel. Oh yeah, bat country."
"830",829,"Alin","American literature from the 60's on to today can be characterised by the following words: drink,smoke,drugs,sex,swearing,rambling,nonsense.Of course there are exceptions but if we're talking about the so called ""greats"" like Kerouac and company that's mostly what you'll get.While Fear and loathing doesn't stray away from that it doesn't present those things as good and doesn't have a pretty view on the America of those times.The descriptions of the people and places are honest,harsh and very funny.Thompson isn't a brilliant satirist but the situations he writes about are so crazy that you can't help smiling.While adding pictures to a book might be called childish,here they actually add up to the tone. If you're looking for an american book about the 60's generation,I'd suggest jumping over Kerouac and Mailer.Thompson sees things as they wore,and this is a quick,funny and decent read."
"832",831,"Dirk Heinz","Weaker than what I expected."
"835",834,"Chibimagic","It's surprising how true to the book the movie ended up being. Entire passages by Thompson are narrated verbatim, which really makes both the book and the movie. Unfortunately, the book ends up being much less entertaining: a lot of paranoia, violence, and irresponsibleness from some perverted moral high ground."
"836",835,"Kevin Douglas","Over rated."
"838",837,"Corey","It's okay, I guess. But why is this book such a big deal?"
"840",839,"Paul Lauria","boring drug-induced haze roadtrip to vegas"
"841",840,"Stacey","I wasn't blown away by anything about this book. Maybe it's because it's been built up as such a classic or maybe it's because it's just bad. I don't think it was bad because I thought it was so out there and wild and crazy. I thought it was bad because it pretended just writing about being wild and crazy makes it immediately worthwhile. Two guys testing their luck by breaking every law made while in Vegas and doing a bunch of drugs. I need more than this. The book really didn't have a plot. About two-thirds of the way through Thompson seemed to realize this and tried to give the book meaning with the ""American Dream"" concept, but it flatlined. On top of being pointless, it was also choppy. One good thing about the book: it was short and quick so I was able to end my suffering in a timely manner. "
"847",846,"Ckthinks","Much like the film, i didnt get it. The seemed to be no beginning and no end... it just started mad and then fizzled out. The middle was alright though."
"851",850,"Lisa ","I find myself impatient with the writing. So beat. If I wanted self-indulgence, I'd read Rebecca Goldstein's new book. I think I'll try Thompson's other books sometime though. I've heard good things about them. "
"854",853,"Yara Hatem","That is a.. very weird read. and not the good kind of weird.I felt I was on drugs just reading it. Things would go blurry for me as well at times. It was very hard to follow. Real things and ""drug"" things were kinda all over the place where I couldn't tell if he was imagining things or if they were actually happening. Which made my experience with the book all worse."
"857",856,"Matthew Levey","I figured his legendary status meant I had to finally read Hunter S Thompson but I found I could not get into this. Maybe it was innovative at the time, but has faced since then? the Fantasy rape scene certainly sticks out in light of current sensibilities. "
"858",857,"Karin","I couldn't finish this book. All the ""parkies"" (what we called stoners) in high school loved it....but I either didn't really get it, or just couldn't really relate. I should try again as a proper adult and see what I think. The movie was kind of good but also kind of boring, so I'm not super optimistic."
"866",865,"Aaron","This is, ostensibly, the drug-fueled ravings of Hunter Thompson, and more strangely, his attorney as they cavort about Las Vegas in search of God-knows-what, on assignment and retainer by an unknown entity to write about something happening in the desert. I don't know what Gonzo journalism is, but I know this: this novel is a cheap imitation of William S. Burroughs, is probably only half true, and is wildly and disproportionately lauded by legions of Hunter Thompson fans who think it's cool that he likes guns and drugs. Does this make me a hater? Probably. But, I don't give a damn. I gave it two stars because there are moments, albeit brief, where Thompson's ability to write overcomes his delusions and hallucinations. I might feel differently had I been in the car with the two of them, but from the comfort of my own home, I'm not impressed."
"867",866,"Russianwitch","Like with a lot of the 'classics' I have no idea why this is so great. Partly it could be because I've actually known drug users and how annoying they can be in RL and have the minimal interest in this kind of thing? No idea, not really impressed.But some bits are amusing."
"874",873,"Terry Heller","I'm sure this book blew people's minds when it was first published in the early 70's. Forty years later, it has lost all of its shock value, and, because the act of doing drugs is no longer inherently cool, much of its cache as well. Also, Hunter S. Thompson seems like a total dick."
"875",874,"Emma K.","very very very weird -Lots of drugs and confusion."
"884",883,"Pasch","Ugh.."
"887",886,"Jessica Robins","I really did not enjoy this book at all. I found it to be boring and it was hard for me to read about people being so destructive with their lives and living in such an excessive way. "
"899",898,"Portia Andrew","My children warned me off watching the film knowing I'd have a penchant to see it because Johnny Depp starred in it. I now understand their concern. This was a required text for English, and no, it was not my favourite. It was not a happy experience for me. It served as a painful reminder for me of a journey I took once, a long time ago, with a drug crazed woman."
"900",899,"Chelsea","This book is basically about a reporter traveling cross-country while engaging in copious amounts of drinking and drug use. It was kinda weird, but to each his own."
"904",903,"Dixie","I just remember I did not really care for this book much, I am not much into comedy, especially people acting stupid, I do like sarcastic and literal humor, but not sick or stupid humor. With that in mind, I recall a road trip a couple of idiots, drugs, vegas, drugs, drunk idiots, and that about sums up my recollection of this story, other words, did not impress me much."
"909",908,"Eddie","I'm not sure why I decided to read this book, especially with all the other books on my shelf or on my kindle begging me to read them. More books were way louder than this book, but for some reason my little brain said, read this one. So, I did. I just finished it and all I can think about is, what is the big deal about Hunter S. Thompson? I have read some reviews that state this isn't his best work. OK, that's fine, but this book is probably the one book, to me, that gets the most attention. So I'll say it again, what is the big deal? I will say that if this isn't his best work, I'd give that argument the benefit of the doubt simply because he is quite a descriptive writer who can draw a scene incredibly well, and this book also made me laugh at times. Very few books actually make me laugh. It didn't make me laugh my ass off or anything, but it still succeeded in making me chuckle and read certain passages out loud to people around me. I shall try one of his more political orientated books the next time I decide to give this once crazy-ass sociopath of a journalist, because I keep hearing that's where his brilliance shines. But not right now, I've had my fill of Thompson to carry me over for a bit. But the next time I try one of his books, I hope I can say, Ah, now I see what the big deal was all about."
"912",911,"Erika","The writing was really good in this book, but I thought that there was not a whole lot to the story. It was kind of funny at parts and the illustrations were interesting. I finished the book because it was short and the writing was decent. Meh."
"916",915,"Malcolm","This is another counter culture classic is is vastly overrated. It is funny for about two chapters and then we are getting bored with profligate profantity and neverending drug abuse. There is little point to this story except the record of some guys who just don't know when enough is enough. "
"924",923,"Josh"," No dynamic. I take drugs - I do messed up stuff - I get paranoid about getting caught - repeat. Oh, sorry. I guess I should have prefaced that with a SPOILER ALERT. It's a classic for a reason. I just don't know what that reason is."
"925",924,"Abigail","This rollicking journey of drugs and debauchery doesn't pay off for me. I thoroughly disliked all the characters in the book, and I didn't care what happened to them. Maybe it's the culture we live in today, or maybe I'm just too old to fall for the ""drugs are cool"" appeal, but I don't count this among the classics."
"932",931,"Nate","Meh. Occasionally entertaining but not worth the time."
"937",936,"Marit","This was an interesting foray into the mind of a completely unabashed drug addict. I found myself wondering many times how a) Hunter S. Thompson managed to keep a job for more than a week and b) what he and his attorney must have looked like to all the folks they blundered past. I got a bit of that sense when the author described his conversations with the bewildered, non-high folk around him (if they were from Sin City though, they remained unperturbed) trying to skirt carefully around these mad men. So this was an overall fun read but fairly repetitive and not fabulous writing."
"947",946,"Niño","I didn't like the book as much as I thought I would. It contained all sorts of crazy thoughts and internal monologues (some of which I was able to relate to). Forever sober people would probably not be able to connect to the characters much. Overall I found the book quite confusing and wasn't really able to follow the thoughts of the characters completely - maybe that's the whole point? A deeper look into a drug soaked mind. I was able to watch the movie 2 years ago which I enjoyed more, maybe because a story like this is better consumed visually."
"950",949,"Jogar01","After reading this book I wonder what leads to people to inflict such damage to their bodies. The book is a retelling of a journalist's search for the American Dream in Las Vegas while high on all kinds of drugs and alcohol. There are references to the political movements of the 60s in this book. Perhaps the inability to cope with defeat and aging led people to seek ways to disassociate themselves from society. The American Dream was basically his ability to be high all the time, have unlimited credit, have the benefit of leisure while being on the job, and not been harrased by the police at any moment. All in all it was an ok book that was a big deal for those that came of age during those years but for someone living in the 21st century, it appears as a joke and as obsolete. Although, good job in developing gonzo journalism!"
"955",954,"Morgan","I read this book because my dad always said it's his favorite, but I mostly found it weird and pointless. Nevertheless, many people consider it an important part of the American cultural landscape, so I'm glad I read it."
"956",955,"Cathy","?"
"963",962,"Caroline Bell","What did I think? This is a completely outrageous and ridiculous caricature of two dudes completely off their asses on a lethal combination of drugs, in Vegas. It was fun. It was weird. It made me uncomfortable. I don't think I would recommend it to a lot of people, but its worth reading simply to get into Hunter S. Thompson's cracked out head."
"966",965,"Hank Stuever","I never responded to the gonzo way, though I always liked the idea of unhinged journalism, and I certainly remember the boys (it was almost always boys) in college journalism and writing classes swooning for it and then going through the inevitable phase of aping it, until they figure out there was only one Hunter Thompson. "
"971",970,"Scott","If you want to read what a drug trip feels like then this book is for you. It seems like the kind of thing that would have appealed to me in high school. Perhaps I came in too late."
"972",971,"Eleana","okay so I finished this book and unless the ending is actually ""page 46? ??"" there is something wrong with my copy so i'm just going to review whatever the hell it is that I read.I kind of picked up this book solely based on a quote which in the end I didn't find in the book which was pretty disappointing.This whole book in general was kind of disappointingIt was boring most of the time and while at times it was a bit funny it was very hard for me to finish this.Might try rereading this at one point in my life however because the reviews of this book on here are pretty good and my copy of this book was pretty messed up"
