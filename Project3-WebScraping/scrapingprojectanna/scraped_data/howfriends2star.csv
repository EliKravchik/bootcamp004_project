"26",25,"Peyman","با بعضي از مظالب اين كتاب مخالفم، ولي در كل كتاب خيلي خوبي هستش. چند سال پيش اين كتاب را خوانده بودم و با خواندن اين كتاب تحولات زيادي در خودم ايجاد كردم. "
"32",31,"Michael A","I read about half of this book before giving up (almost in disgust). I suspect I should not be all that surprised given the author's deliberate name change to try and associate himself with Andrew Carnegie in order to market himself and boost his own popularity. That should have been a huge red flag to begin with.This book is essential reading if you are a politician or salesman and necessarily have to stay on the good side of people most of the time. But I'm willing to bet that most of us don't fall into that kind of category and need more than the advice this book gives to get through our daily lives. Life is far too complex for a book like this to address in any substantive way in my opinion. Further, this book is fundamentally very dishonest in the way it works. It will take some time to explain, but I think it is worth it so that you at least know what you are getting into when you crack open this self-help tome.First, a lot of the advice in this book is perhaps age old wisdom from various sources. He does not hide this fact and still the book has sold millions of copies. I guess as a reading public we like being lectured in morality/manners because this book is no different than a series of Sunday sermons mostly on the same themes. Just to illustrate, here are the ""core"" bits of advice you'll find in the book:The Big Three: ""Don't criticize, condemn, or complain."" ""Give honest and sincere appreciation."" ""Arouse in the other person an eager want.""The Mid-Rank Six: ""Become genuinely interest in other people."" ""Smile."" ""Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language."" ""Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves."" ""Talk in terms of the other person's interests."" ""Make the other person feel important -- and do it sincerely.""The Lower-Class Twelve:""The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.""""Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, ""You're wrong.""""""If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.""""Begin in a friendly way.""""Get the other person saying ""yes, yes"" immediately.""""Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.""""Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.""""Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.""""Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.""""Appeal to the nobler motives.""""Dramatize your ideas.""""Throw down a challenge.""9 Ways to Be a Leader:""Begin with praise and honest appreciation.""""Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly.""""Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.""""Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.""""Let the other person save face.""""Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be ""hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.""""Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.""""Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.""""Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.""Well, as much of a slog as that list might be, I just saved you from reading the book itself. The only thing you will find in the book not in this long comment is chapters that provide example after repetitive example of stories that exemplify those pieces of advice. Do you notice how some of these overlap or even mostly repeat themselves? Also, why are two or three stories based on famous people supposed to provide all the evidence we need to accept the advice? The man studied logic himself -- surely he knows about the fallacies of arguing based on tradition and based on ""authority figures."" It's not a good way to go about proving a point!Here's the thing, though, I recognize that a lot of this advice isn't bad to follow in public and I could be a better person, introspective cynic that I am at times, by taking such advice from time to time. When I am in the classroom, for example, I do try to practice a lot of these things and empathize with other students and colleagues because you do have to act in these ways sometimes to inspire or encourage in that setting. That's why I don't give it one star because it reminds me of that.That being said, I would find it very hard to be around people like this in my own personal life because the ideal person of this book, in Dale's imagination, is the social robot. This person would hardly speak, be far too polite, and be perhaps too attentive to the other person. Nor would this person really say much of consequence because he would be too busy not trying to rock the boat with you to really speak his or her mind. This is probably why I don't have many friends in the sense of this book's definition, but I'm okay with that. It would be a huge waste of time listening to folks I didn't really care for. I'm an introvert at heart and I don't like always being around other people.But I suppose my biggest beef with this book has to do with something entirely different-- here is yet another example of a writer/author not doing what he preaches. Why? This book is mostly filled with persuasion just to get you to take his point of view. Despite all those nice little bits of advice he tries to push, he about breaks every one of them based on his writing style. Here's a man who wants to lecture you, tell you how to act, tells you need to change and that you're wrong about your previous behavior, who doesn't respect your opinion, and so on. It's an odd thing to run into this so often in movies and books -- human beings really are self-centered I suppose. But, for a book that bases its content on being so respecting of other people, this author comes off as having about zero respect for the reader and THEN WANTS YOUR MONEY at the same time for the privilege of reading this book. Could this be any more patronizing?Bear in mind this is just my personal opinion and the book has obviously found an audience within the USA especially, but, if you read like me or think like me, I'd advise you to stay away from it -- and if you must read it, a simple way of doing so would simply be to take the key points from the summary above and putting it into a Word file or list for quick perusal. "
"63",62,"Douglas Echenique Zambrano ","Un libro dedicado a como ganar amigos e influir sobre la gente, o como ser pasivo y dejarte montar la pata por los demás, desde mi punto de vista el libro tiene muchos errores porque hay cosas en la vida que uno puede pasar, obviar, o no hacer nada para cambiarlos pero no puedes tomar un rol pasivo y dejar que todo el mundo te pisotee"
"67",66,"Denise Hogan","Basically good messages, though somewhat simplistic at times. I often felt that the suggestions to ""win friends and influence people"" were manipulative behaviors, worthy of a salesperson trying to make that sale. The author did remind me several times that sincere desire to want to make connections with people is needed, thereby counteracting the intention of manipulation. Since it was written in 1936, the language is somewhat quaint. For me, this made it more entertaining. I've always heard about this book and glad that I finally got around to reading it."
"86",85,"Rawan Al-Wazzan","Though I'm not a fan of self-help books, I decided to give this one a shot. Kinda wish I didn't!The author didn't present any new ideas -or in this case, tips. There weren't any 'aha moments' which I expected to find abundantly. I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed especially after reading all the book's positive reviews.Hope it serves its purpose to other readers even though it didn't with me. "
"120",119,"Rachel Gopal","I did not read the entire book nor was it my intention to. This was an assignment for philosophy where the task was to summarize, criticize and decide if the book was philosophically ethical (which it is not!).However, I did read the main points and all the tips of the book and it did not give bad advice. If your actual intention is to ""win friends and influence people"" it may not be of any help, but the tips are useful in terms of improving your social skills. "
"122",121,"Ashley Johnson","This book was very redundant and went over the same stuff over and over just kind of wording it differently. There were a million and one examples to back up the principles which was kind of annoying. I will say some of this stuff made sense, but I feel like it was also common sense. This would probably benefit someone who really struggles with positive social skills. I'm sure it could be a real gem for them! "
"132",131,"Luke Langley","Art of manliness listed. The book gives decent but obvious advice. It is long winded in telling simple points. Draws a fine line between 'influencing' and 'manipulating' people, but I think Carnegie was sincere in his efforts. "
"144",143,"Nizar Ch","ce livre dans quelques chapitres ne nous apprend pas à nous faire des amis mais plutôt à devenir des apprentis hypocrites et des lèche-bottes professionnels "
"170",169,"Virginia Varland","I want to appreciate this book for some of the timeless truths that it delivers but as a whole it just feels to fake, patronizing, and simplified for me to like."
"177",176,"Jeanny","Throughout the book I felt a sense of enragement and conflict. While Carnegie sets out to deliver the ultimate ""how-to"" guide in relationship building, he, in essence, draws a crippling image of humanity denouncing us all for being shallow, self-absorbed and judgmental. It's sad that we need to be taught to be human, and that genuine curiosity and compassion is twisted into manipulation."
"179",178,"Michael Greenwell","I enjoyed the anecdotes that season Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends Influence People, they have a folksy charm from another era. However, I really wonder whether this book is that valuable. The anecdotes, however charming, have dated considerably, and often strike me as rather selfish despite the books continued claim that the suggested sentiments must ""come from the heart"". The principles that are put forward seem reasonable enough, but the book simply lays them out with only anecdotes to support them, which leaves me with little faith in the practical value of such sweeping suggestions."
"192",191,"Vegard Pettersen","TL;DR Read the summary of points on wiki instead, here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_...The book is a bit outdated, and starts with the premise that if you show attention to others they will like you.It's superficial in that it does not address the differences between politeness and genuine friendships, it is way to wordy, and it struggles with trying to establish how actual relationships would be expected to form from politeness, as opposed to merely a set of aquaintances.Stopped reading at page 64, may get back to finishing it at some point when I am bored, as it has its good points and tidbits, but not enough to way up for its tediousness."
"222",221,"Marija Jure","I have read this book loooong ago and didn't enjoy. But some new people appeared in my surrounding who praised it so much that I decided to give another try after years. Book seemed soooo damn primitive, I had to put a lot of efforts to finish it. I didn't feel like I learned anything new when reading it first time and neither reading this time.The only reason I give this book two stars is because I understand it could be useful for: 1) salesmen (yes, definitely) 2) people who aren't familiar with any basic concepts of human communication.Otherwise it is only for those who want to exploit the friendship for the sake of any kind of gain.My own socialisation success probably comes just intuitively from the basics of education that I received from my family: be nice, thoughtful, considerate, supportive, educated and interesting person that You could have interesting conversations. Most important – genuine, if You want to have likeminded people around You. I can talk quite a lot because I got pretty dominant temper but still for me is important to be a good listener, so I am doing my best to be conscious and observe when people want to talk themselves. One doesn't have to agree on everything and all the time to have real friends, that's for sure! And don't forget that there's nothing more beautiful than a genuinely smiling face."
"240",239,"Angelo","Yet another book that is related to research I am doing for work. Dale Carnagie was known as Dale Carnagey until he changed the spelling of his name to that of the well known industrialist, Andrew Carnegie, in 1922. I wanted to read the original 1937 edition for historical purposes. Instead, I had to settle for an edition from the 1980s. Many of the allusions in the work are quite outdated--that's part of the fun of reading it. He clearly was focused on helping those in the business world, especially salesmen (and I mean MEN), become more successful. His advice reads like nothing but common sense to me. But apparently it is still much in demand (the latest edition was published in April 2007). I'd say to save your money, skip the book and follow the golden rule, which basically summarizes this book."
"241",240,"Rhonda","If you ever need a book to tell you how to change your personality for the better, this is it. Unfortunately, and perhaps my criticism is somewhat misplaced on the book itself, I find that most people are either generally friendly people and thus able to benefit readily from this advice or somewhat less than gregarious. It isn't that less gregarious people are incapable of profiting form this information, but that it appears, very often, a painful transition which they are unable to maintain for any length of time. This is the main reason this book is always worth revisiting, even if one intends to be a hermit crab."
"246",245,"Brandon Vanover","Kiss up. Feign interest. Tell others they are right even when they are wrong. A few of the nuggets of wisdom contained in this book. "
"256",255,"Jasmine","Couldn't finish it completely. Had a lot of good points, but I thought it was pretty obvious and self-explanatory. I just wrote down the main points and ideas to look at and think about for times when I feel like I want to work on being a better friend. "
"258",257,"Katie Henderson","The advice is nice: be kind to people, listen to them, make them feel important. It's just that it's all for this ultimate GOAL of getting rich. Yuck. The book is pretty fun to read, because he really was the first one to say all of it. Now the modern self-help business writers pretty much plagiarize what Dale Carnegie already wrote. Sorry Brian Tracy, you were 50 years too late.But I don't like Brian Tracy, and I don't like this either. I don't mind being told to be kind to people. But ughhhh, it's all for this self-serving purpose. It puts a bad taste in my mouth."
"266",265,"Ciara Garrett","This book is okay. I agree it would have revolutionary back in the early 19 century when it was written, but with so many books written on this topic I feel they have outdone this book. Credit where credit is due as the ideas contained within this book are where the books of today stemmed from. "
"269",268,"Eric Dykstra","Overall lots of good ideas, but just too little content for how many words there were. I found myself skipping sections because of how repetitive it was."
"272",271,"Conrad","After reading half the book I have concluded it's a how to manipulate and get away with being fake in hopes of achieving what you want at the cost of anyone and everybody else.....not impressed to say the least"
"274",273,"Rob Hunsicker","I totally feel influenced and befriended by people who condescendingly use my name thirty times in a two-minute conversation. "
"278",277,"Voidal","The book was egh, ok. But the book pretty much enlists obvious things that whoever listened to their parents should be able to do well in life."
"288",287,"Chris Via","For those who haven't read it: There's a main point (or imperative) at the end of every chapter, and a corresponding rollup at the end of each section. For those with common sense and intuition, you may wish to simply read through these lists, as each chapter is simply packed with quaint stories that illuminate the points, but that (for me) don't really elevate the book above a collection of good reminders."
"289",288,"Emeline","The book was fine and interesting but very dated. I'd call this more of an etiquette book: Carnegie puts emphasis on what would be called manners (remembering people, asking about them etc..). To be honest, this is all good, but won't give you any friends, only make you a doormat, and you might soon find that people flock to you to tell you about themselves, and walk away. So you'll be blessed with impeccable manners, but honestly I don't know anyone who gives importance to manners nowadays, unless you frequent Texan country clubs.He illustrates his points with examples, but they are very vague and repetitive, and I found myself doubting the veracity of more than half of them. The language used is very ""turn of the century"" and I doubt that some of the letters sent by Carnegie's students in order to resolve conflicts of interests would do any good nowadays.I'd say the book is useful in keeping friends and influencing people once you have already reached a leadership role."
"290",289,"Despoina","This book will teach you how to ""make friends quickly and easily"". Creepy... Worth reading for its eloquence and the vintage feel though!"
"301",300,"Alyssa Siefert","If you get in an argument, the best way out is to say 'Let's Google it'"

"305",304,"Jody Hultman","Should be called, ""How to Cave in Every Situation and Remain Spineless."" At the very least, not impressive. If I have tot say something nice, I'd say that there are a few good pointers in here that work when applicable, but not in every-day dealings and constant conversations with people. When dealing with peers, friends, and subordinates, I'm not a fan of placing flattery, sincere or not, in front of constructive criticism. Criticism is more well-received when direct and not coated in sugar. Respect is earned and not normally earned via politics and fluff- which is the majority of this book's composition."
"308",307,"Dev Nithiavel","This book is a sugar-coated candy that when taken excessively, could end up in diabetes. Maybe its useful if you're into sales. You can't use this like a bible as what some people claim. It's too superficial. The world is a much tougher place and by strictly following the tips in this book, you could end up miserable. Of course there are some good points here and there but, that's it. Just have a quick read to see what's so great about this overated book. And put it aside. This complicated world needs much better self-help books."
"312",311,"Marks54","This book presents one of the classic statements of popular psychology oriented around positive self-image, self reliance, and cooperative relationships with others. It is one of the most popular and influential books of its type ever and provided the foundations for contemporary self-help celebrities, such as Oprah Winfrey, as well as much of current motivational and organizational psychology that one finds in current business school curricula.What to make of it? I tend to side with the critics, who are numerous. It is difficult to argue with the basic points of the book, taken at a surface level. Most people enjoy being respected, agreed with, and successful. Confidence and self-reliance are no doubt important personal characteristics in personal success. Many people do not enjoy conflict or being disagreed with and would prefer instead cooperative relations with others. OK, but so what?The problem comes once it is realized that Carnegie is highlighting an ambivalence that is inherent in many of our social relationships. On the one hand, we can interact with people on their own terms and without expectations of obligations, duties, or norms of reciprocity. We can deal with and respect people as they are. On the other hand, however, much of what we do in social life involves either trying to accomplish something through other people or having other people trying to use us to accomplish something of importance to them. In trying to balance these two aspects of social relations, most of us become aware of the need to balance. We do not usually treat commercial relationships as close friends. We do not draw up elaborate performance-based contracts with loved ones such as family members. The problem is that people who expect to be treated as independent persons do not appreciate being used by others for some personal end. It is conceptually difficult to see how someone can be both taken authentically and respected as a person while at the same time being viewed as an agent for someone else. Family members and loved ones do not like to be used. Commercial partners do not appreciate being treated as friends when more immediate personal goals were the basis for interactions.Many adults learn to balance these differing perspectives towards others. Sometimes we treat others at arms length while at other times friendships can develop. Carnegie's classic work calls on the reader to both treat people on their own terms and also to attempt to influence them to get their cooperation in attaining one's objectives. Without more specification of how and where to balance, however, the book becomes a more cynical effort to redefine the problem of positive social relations in the form of a solution -- in order to influence people and get your way, treat them authentically. The rub, of course, is how to go about doing this. It is akin to arguing that the solution to poverty is easy -- just get some money!The faux sincerity and false positivity in the service of influencing others come across as phony and manipulative after a while. This recalls another old maxim - if something seems to good to be true, it probably is too good to be true. The oversimplified examples and testimonials also get old in a hurry. The reduction of large business enterprises and their managers to a series of positive work interactions with employees is simplistic at well. The details matter, individual skills matter, industry structures matter, history matters. It is nice to imagine that a positive attitude can conquer all and bring one riches. That lets a lot of other factors off the hook for explaining success or failure. But wishing it is so does not make it so. The more I read it, the more it sounds like a text on manipulation and less like an industrial manual."
"327",326,"Aaron Lord","Not sure it lives up to the hype. Could be reduced by 67% by removing silly redundant stories."
"328",327,"Anita Byrne","I read this when I graduated from cosmetology school at age 22 or so. It was helpful to me because I needed so much work in the area of personality development and social skills.My dad liked the book because it made him more wary of tactics of salesmen."
"351",350,"Ruri Gokou","The title is highly misleading. The situations and advice that the author gives is fine, but it seems more geared for a salesperson. It's about how to win business partners than any real lasting friendships. Don't get me wrong. There is some good advice in here but only about half of it seemed very real and applicable in my life. Furthermore this book needs to be updated with situations today. The examples given aren't fit for this day and age. Like the one about the old woman giving some young guy a car because he showed some interest in her old house. That in particular stuck in my mind as ridiculous. This book was so-so. I think the advice and principles are fine but it needs better examples to go with them. I don't see how it gets the high praise that it does. "
"383",382,"Candy Boisvert","Meh. Next."
"386",385,"D","This book was good, but there was nothing groundbreaking or out of the ordinary in here that I haven't already seen in other books. Great intro for people who are not emotionally intelligent. This would be great for a sociopath who doesn't know how to relate to people and wants to at least feign it."
"393",392,"Dana Jeri Maier","I listened to about half of this. Too sanctimonious to finish. "
"396",395,"Suzan Lauder","I didn't finish this book. It really annoyed me because it basically tells you how to suck up to people to get your own way. Carnegie people would argue against that, in fact, Carnegie himself is flabbergasted at one point in the book when someone makes that exact point to him. Sorry, but that's exactly how it reads to me."
"419",418,"Sarah Cv","Having read this book, you will look back on it and.... be unable to remember a single original thought. Mostly a lot of obvious sales garbage that you've probably already heard before."

"472",471,"Brian Virtue","brilliant"
"484",483,"Marla","I'd like to say that the book helped, but what made me finish the book are the samples/short stories inserted between Carnegie's reiteration that you need to think of others' wants first prior your own and that you must control your temper. The way the book was written may have been better effective on a seminar rather than in a book. The reiteration was a bit dragging."
"496",495,"Christian Dibblee","Books like this are always good to read from a self-improvement standpoint. It's good to have some working knowledge of how to make good impressions on people. I enjoyed Carnegie's admission that he was not promoting a ""bag of tricks"" but rather a total change of life to become less superficial and more sincere.That said, this book is dated and I didn't enjoy the way it was laid out. The never-ending story of anecdotes was entertaining to begin with, but quickly became tedious and repetitive. Also, these stories aren't as helpful in 2012. I found myself saying, ""If I said that, this person would think I'm creepy."" There are different habits of interaction in 2012 that I don't think this books accurately addresses. It does provide a decent baseline, but I would caution anyone against following it to the letter right now but being more situational. Being more sincere is necessary, but whether you speak in the ways he recommends might work out well or poorly depending on the situation."
"497",496,"Morgan (Turbo)","The book started out nice but towards the middle the examples started to wear me out and left me wishing for a more modern version of this book"
"502",501,"Taylor Storey","In my estimation this is the most influential/original of the self help books. Id include Norman Vincent peale's ""the power of positive thinking"" an Napoleon hill's ""think and grow rich"" along the same caliber. I think every good reader needs to read one of those books, and needs to be aware of the immense impact of this way of thinking throughout western culture (especially American). The problem is that beyond being aware of it, in my opinion it's pretty much bullshit. It's not helping our world to ""mind over matter"" everything. It makes for good sports stars, good business sellers, but bad product development. You can trick yourself into loving a bad life, and into thinking you are contributing to the world. Maybe you are, probably you aren't. I recommend reading the last 5 pages of Steve jobs' biography by Walter Isaacson to understand the better version of the idea presented in this book. Be a product person, not a sales person. No mind tricks, find the things that are good in the world. "
"538",537,"Torsten","another book that seems to be liked by most people. sadly I cannot share that. while some points he is making are interesting and helpful, most of the content here makes a old-fashioned and badly crafted impression on me."

"571",570,"Hannah Dubrow","I felt that the principles were too basic for anyone who is naturally personable, friendly, or observant. Maybe it's because I read an edition from the 80s, but this book felt extremely dated and a bit obsolete. You'd do better to read a few articles off lifehacker.com. "

"639",638,"Emmy","I read this book for the first time forty years ago. It was an eye opener then. It outlined what you need to do to become ""popular"" and to get what you want whether it was a job or a new dress!Forty years later I find it less than admirable. It may have been ""right"" then but ""wrong"" now due to the shift from conformity to personal expression and the fact that we no longer label different as wrong. Or it could simply be that it no longer acceptable to me personally. I think it depends on what you want to accomplish. If it is only the results that matter then then this is the perfect book. It helps you manipulate people in a polite way that makes it increasingly difficult for them to say no. My problem with this is that the real you gets buried deeper and deeper under layers of initially agreeing to what you actually oppose. I respect more someone who has the integrity to state their beliefs while respecting others'."
"655",654,"Melvin ","This book was okay. I wouldn't r read it again, but I would recommend to a used car salesman. It just seemed like it was full of tactics to get over on people. I might be being a little critical, but, I just believe in being me and accepted for what I am, and this book seems like it teaches you to manipulate people in a very small way."

"677",676,"Laura Woodyard","I appreciated that this book looks at how to integrate oneself into rising into the socialite and social hierarchy of society because for a number of people in this world, that is of importance, and I can sit back, and understand their mindset, and understand what it is that they are seeking to achieve, and then go against the flow and do my own thing.What I didn't appreciate is that in some ways I felt like I was closing each chapter, and walking away feeling slimy and sleezy. I felt untrue to myself, and that I was being untruthful; that It wasn't about a mutual exchange but more about what can that person do for me, instead of respect for that person and just recognizing that they exist in more of a non-judgement sort of way, and that they might not be of the status quo, but they deserve rights just like every other human.I understand opinions will be formed... for example, in the case of current history (2015), with a number of incidents with terrorist attacks, people will not like or appreciate actions or the integrity of certain individuals or consider them disrespectful, aggressive, and a bit immature, such as ISIS.As I repeat, for me, it was more of the sort of aspect where I felt it lacked a sort of consideration, and it was more about fulfilling someone's personal vanity fair status quo, as opposed to living up to their own self, and value system. Maybe for others, that is their sort of value system: it is all about social status and the status quo. And that is fine with me. For me, I would rather seek honesty and character assets of people who appreciate and show a sense of loyalty, empathy and respect towards others (it doesn't have to be everyone), even if they have nothing to give in return especially from a financial sense, but rather based on commensalism or for the mutual benefit of experiencing the shared moment together. Maybe it is just a philosophy and way of life.There have been a few people I have crossed paths with in my life, who have recommended Dale Carnegie theory, and they were not so nice of people, more of the mean guys and girls, acting in a not so nice sort of way, manipulated people, to a degree that really turned me off to the whole process. And some were critical of labels and if that means that materialism and affluenza is what defines those friendships, than I don't want to be your friend."

Initially i was so impressed as i found it very direct and straight forward message which we all know that are universally correct principles of life but we forget to apply them and those who remember stand out in the usual stream. But later on i found those rules out to be an effort directed towards book writing and not very practical as to make all of them part of your personality is either next to impossible or if done will transform you into a hypocrite of highest order. To what extent person can or should hide his inner feelings, sentiments and his soul? This is a question that comes to my mind after reaching three fourth of the total volume. I feel person must segregate people as per his/ her intimacy and must be very clear to whom to speak his/her heart out and with whom to remain diplomatic. He must not assume a diplomatic role across the board."

"800",799,"David ","This was kind of a random book to read, but a friend had given it to me and I'll read pretty much anything. Overall it was a quick read as each chapter is mostly stories on top of stories that illustrate the principle. Most of the principles are rather common sense - for example, it is better to listen more and talk less. I found the book boring at times, the stories were almost unnecessary fluff to build up the point. It would be almost as beneficial to simply list the principles here and save anyone else the time in reading the book. Yes it is considered a classic and it certainly offers good teaching on how to be a friend to others but, to say it again, much of each chapter just seemed like fluff built around the principle to provide enough information for a book.I did appreciate how the author emphasized at times that these principles are not meant to be used to manipulate people in a bad way. At the same time, the author seemed very arrogant when he, in the introduction, recommended reading the book once quickly, again slower, and then carrying it around and returning to it often. As I read that my thought was that the author was full of himself, as if this book hold the key to life. Overall, this book is worth perusing at a bookstore and the principles are valuable in terms of learning how to interact with people. "

Second, there was a feed on LinkedIn where people were asked what book influenced them. Many were those you would suspect, i.e. Lean In, The Greatest Generation, etc. But one person wrote a glowing review of this book. I tried to find the latest edition, but am not truly sure I did. Although SOME of the concepts remain relative (people want to talk about themselves), others seem dated (""creating competition to improve productivity is infallable!"") Carnegie takes a ""father knows best' approach to communication, which may have worked when society committed to a job and hoped to stay in it for life, moving up in the company. Many of the examples were of ""the boss"" making a statement to employees to inspire them. In today's society, many of those statements may encourage the employee to look for a job in another company. Other examples were of family life. I believe there is a place for a book on this topic in today's society and would love to see an updated version. There is a newer book related to technology. I may check that out....some day!"

Make the fault seem easy to correct. So these are the principles that I liked. The book wasn't that great. I had a hard time getting into it. "
"907",906,"Allen","The classic by Dale Carnegie is easier to read than I anticipated. I expected to read about a complicated formula for making friends and influencing others. Carnegie's book can easily be skimmed or if you like, you could simply read the last page of each chapter where he notes the single idea he presented in the chapter.The behaviors he recommends are basic to socializing in a winsome manner. I have already learned most of what I have read (I've read through the first two sections) through observing others and participating in conversations at church during fellowship and outreach. So far I have found the book helpful to review some of what I had already learned.There is no flow of thought in the writing. The author simply butts together multiple concrete examples of the concept he is trying to teach. This is why I find the chapters easy to skim."

Important to keep in mind, but not mindblowing, and not the kind of read that will turn you from an introvert into an extravert. tl;dr - ""Try to listen to people, don't be a jackass, give (sincere) compliments readily."""

I also extensively read the reviews on this website (and this review might be influenced by one of them).I did not read the whole book, and quickly scrolled through the pages. The examples seemed to be interesting, and the ideas author says (as summarized on Wiki) should definitely work. But for me it's more of a deception. Sure, I do need to use these skills at office, relatives, strangers.. but for friends and at least those whom I trust, I can't get the gist of things like:1- Don't criticize, condemn, or complain. (Get a therapist? We all have down times, I am sure if there is trust, a friend shall listen to me, unless I overdo it)2- Never show others that you are not interested in what they have to say. (Pure deception!)3- The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. (Depends upon how you define argument, but difference of opinions and their respect is how you start trusting people and learning about life)4- Make the other person happy about doing what you suggest. (For business OK, for a trusted friend, no!)I read another book, in which the concept was more about character building, no quick self-fixes. This book while definitely should be used in work settings, businesses, maybe even families, but for those whom you trust, for me its more of a deception. My cup of tea!"

With that said, I already knew I had a bias against the ideas of this book. It was nice to take a step back into history but this book is apart 100 years old and our ideas of psychology have changed. This book is the greatest promoter of the ""personality ethic"" where you need to change outwardly to be effective. That in my view is a quick fix where I agree with Covey we need to start from within. Also Susan Cain mentioned how this book also promoted the ""extrovert ideal"" which is about how we emphasize extroversion in society. This books is all about this. Dale Carnegie writes simple things one can do to win friends like smiling or giving a compliment before criticism. He also kept mentioning how it had to be sincere. I believe sincerity comes from within not what you display outwardly so by this Carnegies method is outmoded. The writing was a bit annoying, it was as if someone just googled a smattering of anecdotes and quotes about subjects. There was little cohesion between the references just that it followed his chapter theme. Since it was almost 100 years ago I admire how much research he did. He even went into Chinese philosophy. All in all there are some hidden gems but this book should not be tired any longer as a must read for winning friends it is outdated. "

Then the facts and the advice are much less straightforward, hence much more interesting and engaging.

"1551",1550,"Mediaman","This outdated book is essentially a guide to how salespeople can win over clients by making the client feel important, talk about himself, feel listened to, etc. Long ago this was probably revolutionary but now it's just the way everyone sells. The problem is that this book's concepts are so simple (""remember the person's first name"") that they sound like your grandfather patting you on the head, telling you to just smile and people will treat you nicely the rest of your life. It just ain't that easy!The biggest failure in the book is that it doesn't actual tell you HOW to achieve any of the ""principles"" he espouses. Some blanket statements are made about what to do or not to do, but overall concepts are rarely given practical illustrations and instead the author talks about Lincoln or some distant politician/businessman/millionaire who applied the principle and suddenly life was a success. Impractical.What I conclude after reading this is that society was changed by the author (whose real name isn't Carnegie) and this book, but it wasn't in a good way. It tells the salesperson to be genuine and patient but resulted in people being fake and pushy. Despite the words that are used, the ultimate point that is pushed is that you need to make others ""feel"" important and listened to in order to get what you want. That's very different than yourself actually feeling that others are more important and interesting than you are."

Having made many whole-hearted attempts to apply many of these suggestions in the modern workplace, I can say these are ""theory good"", but don't work on people who already feel exceedingly entitled and as though they know everything already.

Now, though, platitudes like 'when you want someone to do something, tell them why it'll benefit them, rather than why it'll benefit you' seem obvious enough that writing them down doesn't seem worthwhile.There are definitely still a few gems in here, but you'll have to wade through a lot to get to them.

"1809",1808,"Murph","""The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks."" - Dale CarnegieDespite Carnegie's intentions this book reads like a bag of tricks; The examples that he uses, the titles of the chapters, and even the title of the book suggest that. If someone follows every single principle in this book the way they are described they would be the biggest manipulative asshole. In fact, I'm pretty sure I've met a few people that probably love this book. There are some good things in here, but the goal should be to make yourself more likable, not to ""win"" or ""influence"" people. If you read the book from this perspective you may be able to translate some of these principles into useful ideas. There is a lot of repetition in the book so I've tried to reduce them down to what I think is most helpful.Here is what I came away with:* Don't be a complainer or criticizer. Don't condemn people. No one like that shit and no one respects that type of person; even the people who will listen to it.* Identify things that you truly appreciate about people and always let them know.* Identify what other people desire and support them. Find creative ways to incorporate their desires with your own. Work together to find the best way to meet them.* Everyone is unique and has something interesting to add to your life. Figure out what it is. Encourage them to talk about themselves to find out. Explore what they find interesting.* Smile, it is one contagious thing that people will be happy to catch.* Show people that you value and respect them: call them by their name.* Focus on understanding others and seeing things from their perspective; look for common ground. Highlight the good points they make.* Take responsibility for your actions and promptly admit when you are wrong.* You can't convince people; Let them adopt ideas themselves and inject their own* It is more helpful to assume people have good motives. Find ways to see others in the best light.* Be enthusiastic about what inspires you and share that with others* Challenge people in a way that inspires them* Correct people in a way that builds them up and encourages them.

"1836",1835,"Gazelle","For most of the serious readers its the cheesiest book one can read! (So as it was to me) But Com'on! If you are a marketer and business is something that you have to cope with every single day it is better to handle it with some kind of care and respect towards the ones you have to deal with. Why do most of us assume many Marketers and business man and women are creeps? Cause in the way they act something make us feel they look at us from above, that we are nothing but a bunch of money to them. So is that bad that someone wrote a book at 30's and recommend a more respectful and caring behavior towards people? You can judge that by yourself!"
"1859",1858,"Maxime","More than a bunch of common sense what I liked when reading this book is that it actually gives a sort of explanation on how many Americans communicate. Great to read on a sociological point of view, and some advises are actually quiet worth trying."
"1875",1874,"Katy","It was an okay book. I felt that I needed to read it just because it is such a popular book. It's a bit dated, most of the referenced stories are from the early 1900s. Mr. Carnegie is a fascinating man, and the information is pretty good. It would still be helpful today, but it needs to be updated to include the online communication.Maybe there is an updated book, but the one I read seemed like a first edition. Again, the info can still be used today, just wished it could translate better."
"1879",1878,"Kailin","It has taken me too long to get through reading this book, and I have now decidedly re-shelved it for the future. Because it was written so long ago, the language is a little hard for me to swallow and digest. Hence my snail-pace reading in this. There may be some day when I might re-open this book again and continue reading."

"1890",1889,"Fanny","When this book became available at my local library, I was ecstatic! Finally I would get to read THE business book that everyone is talking about!I was severely disappointed. The whole book repeats itself a lot, and give advice that, while good, is very much a part of the common sense realm. I still got a few things from it (and read it entirely), so it is worth a read, but don't let the hype get to you!"
"1895",1894,"Jessica Crawford","I have a problem with the general tenents of this book - that manipulating people to get what you want is the way to go. Instead of creating a path for your goals using mindfulness and compassion, and a true desire to hear others and make yourself heard, this book preaches deceit. Not a fan. "
"1901",1900,"Marc Nissen","Heard many good reviews about this book. Kind of a bible for sales which maybe was in early years. Now for me it is not up to date anymore and I find all examples given (and too often repeated) fairly not out of this century. I did not enjoy reading it and I felt a little brainwashed."

"1908",1907,"Suzy","I freely admit that my objectivity has been skewed by bitterness. Having applied (read: considered) the techniques outlined and valiantly fought off the urge to gag at the many sugary scenarios provided by Carnegie...I find that my level of popularity/social success has remained unchanged! Hopes: dashed. Friends won: nil. People influenced: hopefully many through this review --> do not entrust the delicate job of your fragile ego-building to this book! "
"1910",1909,"Klyemann","I normaly don't like ""self-help"" books, so it's quite ironic that my first review is of one.I first found this book on one of the ""life-changing books"" lists on the web and after some more googling I saw that noumerous people still consider it an eye opener even though it was written almost 80 years ago. So naturally I was interested.Given the high expectations I had of this book, there was little chance I wouldn't be dissapointed, but I didn't expect it to be so predictable. Most of the advice are nothing more than common sense: be nice, make other people feel important, don't argue... Nothing a well-rounded person doesn't know already.The most annoying thing about this book, thoug, was that it read like a TV commercial. You know what I'm talking about: ""I couldn't sleep, I bought this mattress and now I sleep like a baby"". The whole book is full of anecdotes that follow along this lines. ""I wanted a better pay, so I made my boss feel important and he promoted me,"" or: ""I wanted to sell my product so I was nice to my potential buyer and he bought my whole stock."" Reading this bull**** was a real pain.The only reason I give this book two stars is becaus I acknowledge that there are still some people out there who aren't familiar with these basic concepts of human communication."
"1935",1934,"Oeystein Hanssen","If you want to win friends and influence people, the single most important thing you should do is to be nice. Kind of obvious, but in certain situations it may be harder than you think.To help you, Carnegie introduces behavioral principles you can apply in ""any"" situation to: - Handle people- Make people like you- Win people to your way of thinking and- Change peopleThe entire book pretty much consists of stories that exemplifies how people have applied the various principles to get what they want. Although a powerful way of communication, it may be a bit too much storytelling in my opinion. But I get why he did it.I'm sure one may be able to influence people by applying various of these principles, but I would be careful not to use all of them on real friends. Sincerity is pretty important in relationships. But the book could teach you a thing or two about how to properly handle arguments with real friends, too. Looking at it as a ""business"" book (which I believe was Carnegie's main focus, as well), I'm sure the book can help you win ""friends"" and influence people you have a professional (or casual/shallow) relationship with."
"1939",1938,"Tirthankar Chakraborty","I found this dusty old book years back in my grandfather's collection. Never cared about making friends, but tried some of the techniques to influence my mother into not making me study as much when I was younger. Didn't work. Thus, the low rating. "
"1958",1957,"Pam","Much of this book is very outdated. Many people would be skeptical if you tried to manipulate them in this way. However, many good things were in this book and it does deserve a read."
"1966",1965,"Nick Griffiths","A bit out of date, but mostly good. ""Become genuinely interested in people"" and learning to listen properly is timeless good advice, but ""don't criticise"" isn't."

"1986",1985,"Marquess","I have heard about and have been recommended this book so many times throughout the past few years but I resisted. I resisted because the title sounded like it could have just as easily been ""How to Manipulate People."" Yet, I read it because I have been assured time and time again that that is not the case and the advice contained within is quite valuable. They were right. This book is not really about manipulating people. Carnegie stresses this numerous times and every principle must be carried out sincerely. The advice isn't bad either. If you are new to the world of business relationships or maybe are not confident in your day to day conversations with acquaintances then this book can be really helpful and I think that is why it receives such high praise. Dale Carnegie's writing style is great. It is clear and easy to read. The book flows effortlessly.Still, I have a few complaints. The book is way too long for what it is. Each chapter could be trimmed down to just the principle of the chapter, a few choice excerpts, and maybe one example to drive the point home. Instead Carnegie repeats himself and offers way too many examples which are hardly convincing. It is all anecdotal evidence and some of it is so extraordinary that it is hard not to be skeptical of the advice. Even then, the principles aren't entirely unique each chapter. More often than not a principle is the same exact advice as a principle in a previous chapter. Other times, it is such a slight difference you wonder why two principles were not combined to one. The primary reason this book gets such a low score is that even though it was a short and quick read I feel it wasted my time. I only held out and finished it because it was so short and I just wanted to be able to have said I read it and form a fair opinion of it. Another reason is that while I think Carnegie means it when he says we should be sincere in all our interactions his principles contradict that. For example, one principle says we should ""become genuinely interested in other people."" This is something we can do genuinely with some people, for sure. But not everyone. It is insincere to say that we can be genuinely interested in EVERYbody and the mere fact that we are becoming interested on others based on a principle that we read in a book is a little insincere isn't it? Finally, it is poor advice with regards to real friendships. Carnegie's view of ""friendship"" is a utility for business. It is really a shame that people might read this book and think it is a way to carry yourself to making true friends that care about you. It is anything but that. It is a path towards making functional business relationships that benefit both parties. Trying to follow this advice in normal life will only succeed in surrounding yourself with self-centered people who don't care about you. Please remember that this book is not ""a way of life."" It was a way of life for Carnegie because his life was business and that is why he describes his book as such. In conclusion, it's okay advice (but only with business relationships). I see why it is given so much praise but I don't really like how it is presented and do not think it is advice that helps you express yourself as interesting or sincere. I also think there are people who will read this and believe it to be a way of life and approaching all relationships when that is not the case. It is a way of approaching functional business relationships not real friendships."
"1989",1988,"Geku","While most the one-liner tips and tricks to manipulate people - while being absolutely sincere [sic] - into giving you what you want seem timeless, the examples and explanations are outdated and the only true value I'd assign to this book in this century is historical. It offers a pretty fascinating view into the lives of American men in the first half of the 20th century, but all it really tells you is to be nice. Or trick people into thinking that you are.Fun fact: Charles Manson used what he learned from this book in prison to manipulate women into killing on his behalf. So there's that."
"2000",1999,"John Weston","It had a lot of good principles, but I seemed seemed to me that a lot of it was how to munipipulate people, instead of influence them. "
"2007",2006,"Rachel Jackson","For all the things I've heard about this book, it was a letdown. How To Win Friends And Influence is repetitive and boring, and completely undermines the premise of basic human relationships.Dale Carnegie spends the entire book telling the reader how to manipulate people — that's the gist of it. He positions it under the guise of being helpful in business relationships and making friends with people, but all it really is is a way to get ahead in life by positioning people where you want them. I didn't like how his message is only to please people so they please you. That sounds nice, but what if we try being nice to one another without ulterior motives? What an idea! One of his rules is to make other people like you by becoming genuinely interested in them. Why not be interested in them and not expect anything in return? Teaching men — and it's only men, naturally — to suck up to people to get what you want seems like a dumb thing to be a bestseller."
"2018",2017,"Nivaria Ramirez","Libro que te hace reflexionar muchísimo sobre la forma de tratar a los demás. Lo que más me ha gustado, ha sido el final, donde se relata la dura y cruda vida que tuvo el autor y aún así, consiguió el éxito. Todo merece su tiempo y todos tenemos la oportunidad de aprovecharlo. No suelo leer este tipo de libros pero te maravillas al comprender lo importante que es ser empático. Lo recomiendo a todos aquellos que somos un poco egoístas y egocéntricos, y todos lo somos alguna vez. Yo incluida, por supuesto."

Well , I decided to stop reading the book after reading this, however I managed to see Dale's point of view.""Why prove to a man he is wrong ? Is that going to make him like you ? Why not let him save his face? He didn't ask for your opinion.He didn't want it, why argue with him !?Always avoid the acute angle. "" Then I asked myself : Is it really going to work? Alas , the deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be IMPORTANT , the desire to be APPRECIATED.So yes , it works ; cause you simply give the other person that desire he needs.Second question will be : Don't you find it such a negative behavior ? I mean how can you live without condemning , criticizing , or complaining!Then I said okay maybe the concept he is talking about is regarding to the good things (Never criticize something that is good).Then I read this "" The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it""How can you be so surrendering Dale Carnegie !!!2 stars are for the awesome information regarding to dealing with people and influencing them , -3 stars for the surrendering messages in this book. "
"2042",2041,"Xatolos","""Always mention the good and never mention the bad""Pretty much sums up this book. It's got a few tidbits but for the most part its quite far from reality. It's designed to sell by making things sound good and work in your favour. But it ignores reality and assumes everyone wants to work, work hard, isn't greedy, lazy, wouldn't ever steal, or even be a psychopath. You know, real world people. While not everyone will be bad, but to assume everyone is good is a fatal flaw this book. It never points out you need to also realize that while for some you need to help build up, but for some people you just need to learn how and when to cut and take your losses."
"2048",2047,"Zac","This is a book written for assholes who don't know to naturally be kind. I've worked with businessmen who've obviously read this book or done one of the conferences, and they come off as phoney actors playing the role and following the equation of being a nice person. The best part of reading this book was learning to recognise the signs of someone who is normally a jerk, but who is trying to manipulate the people around them to behave a certain way. "
"2056",2055,"Stephan Engels","In my opinion the ideas outlined in this book aren't that useful in every day life. I f you're a salesperson or in politics, then you might find it it'll have some pointers. Just have compassion for other people and be true to yourself. To quote a favorite person: Do no harm, but take no shit."
"2060",2059,"Ahsan","This book did not help me win friends and influence people.I think Dale Carnegie may have oversold a bit with the title.

"2079",2078,"Ana","It was good to be reminded of some of what makes one endearing to others. However, maybe because of all the hype I was expecting more.

"2139",2138,"Shannah","People often talk about how great this book is and how influential it has been on their lives, but I can't say that it had much of an impact on me. If any. Most of the advice given in the book seemed horribly obvious. The book has been updated and revised since the first edition in 1936, but many of the personal testimonies seemed very quaint and old-fashioned and wouldn't exactly translate to life in the new millennium. This isn't to say that everything in the book was not worth reading, but if you're expecting it to be earth-shattering you might need to lower your expectations. "
"2141",2140,"Steve Carney","You can basically sum this book with this: be kind/smile, everyone cares most about themselves, and remember that everyone wants to feel important. Perhaps more groundbreaking at the time of this classic's publishing, I found this book to be very common sensical with a tone I best perceive as pretentious. Still, I suppose the principles discussed in this book are a good starting point for those completely unaware of how to win friends and influence people."
"2155",2154,"Andrew Saul","As a self help book this really stinks. It's a whole lot of tips for success that only a complete psychopath would believe and follow with any conviction. But as a window into the minds of all those people ""striving for success"" who support the self help industry it's fascinating. This book is pretty historic as it basically started the booming self help industry we know today. It was (and still is) a raging success as it tapped into the fears many of failure many of us have that manifest themselves in low self esteem. For that reason (and that reason alone) it is worth reading. This book spawned a million imitators and is the reason we pretty much have Amway and other pyramid selling organisations. "
